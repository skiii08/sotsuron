Love and Death," As shallow experiences go, this movie is one of the best
","This is a great fun movie, in which Woody Allen tried out many ideas, most of which are terrific and some of which cringe-making.  I have just revisited this film after 20-odd years and still like it.The terrific ideas are many.  From the ha-ha humour section for example, the scene where the Russian soldiers are practicing formation charging is a classic, as is the scene at the opera where Woody flirts with the Countess, as is the scene where Diane Keaton flirts while her herring-merchant husband appears to be taking a herring upstairs to bed with him......... There is also the parody/pastiche section - all those Bergman references (I got far more of them this time than I did the first time round) and the Eisenstein parody using Alexander Nevsky as the music is great.On the cringe-making side, the literature references did not always work for me - the dialogue which throws in every Dostoevsky title under the sun is a little sophomoric for my taste.  There is also a reference, at one other point, to liking 12-year-olds which is utterly repellent in its own context, let alone Woody's.But this film scores more often than it misses and is still great fun after all these years.  No deep meaning here, but as shallow experiences go this film is one of the best.",8,0,0,2 February 2003
Memento," Compelling and superbly constructed
","We found this film compelling throughout and superbly constructed.  The idea of working backwards through time works in this movie precisely because the protagonist suffers from a rare 'total' short-term memory loss.  The strange time lines induce us to empathise with the protagonist, although it is clear that he is not an altogether sympathetic character.  This is not a great movie for characterisation, but it is utterly memorable and deserves the adulation it has received.",8,0,2,5 August 2003
The Natural," Enjoyable, but ultimately disappointing
","I'll probably make myself unpopular here, as the consensus seems to be that this is a great movie.  I found it enjoyable, but ultimately disappointing. 
I read the novel many years ago (around the time the movie first came out) and resisted seeing the movie because the novel did almost nothing for me. I was persuaded to see the movie on the grounds that it is in fact not true to the book.  I agree that the movie is an improvement on the book in many ways, not least because it lacks pretension.The Natural movie certainly held my attention for the 2+ hours and is homely entertainment, Hollywood style.  However, the characters are terribly two-dimensional and the ending 'ball by ball' predictable - even to a Limey baseball greenhorn like myself.  If you want a couple of hours of pacey family entertainment, watch and enjoy.  If you want to see a truly great or classic movie, personally I would recommend that you look elsewhere.",6,3,7,18 September 2002
Dead Poets Society," Try Demian, Potter or Vietnam instead
","Well I'd heard great things about this movie, but it didn't really cut the mustard for me.  There are potentially great issues up for debate here, but they are not properly dealt with in this movie: - does the traditional, disciplined style of education work? - should parents strongly direct their children's career paths? - are teenagers easily influenced by parents, teachers etc. or not? - is it possible to pull by making an idiot of yourself?I went to a public school (message to non UK readers - 'public' means 'private, elitist' in the UK) albeit not as a border and nowhere near as grand a place as that depicted in the film.  I recognised some of the boys angst.  I recognised some of the teacher types - even Keating seemed like only a slightly exaggerated form of one or two teachers I knew.But the film didn't work.  It seemed manipulative to me.  It didn't grapple with the issues where it mattered.  It was sanctimonious.  It was predictable.  No school that stuffy would have hired such a notorious alumnus to teach.If you want great stuff on influences on young people and their educational angst, try reading Demian and/or The Glass Bead Game by Herman Hesse.  If elitist schools is your bag, read or see the Harry Potter stuff.  If Robin Williams being the maverick takes your fancy, try Good Morning, Vietnam.Life is short, so when 'gathering ye rosebuds while ye may', I suggest you gather some other stuff and give the dead poets a miss.",4,6,14,10 April 2003
Being John Malkovich," Strange but good viewing
","I rather liked this movie.  It seems to have split its jury between those who love it and those who hate it.  This is probably down to its weirdness. Getting over the strange plot, it is a thoroughly absorbing and entertaining film.  All the main characters are truly horrible - even the Cameron Diaz 'mouse-of-a-wife' character (unusual part for her) is a tough bitch underneath the weak, sugar surface.  In fact the chimpanzee was probably the only character I genuinely liked. Which is fine, by the way, because although you don't like the characters, they are quirky and interesting enough that you want to see what happens to them.Takes a while to warm up - Jane slept through most of the first half hour which made the plot wicked difficult to explain.  I recommend seeing it awake the whole way through.",7,0,1,7 January 2003
The Usual Suspects," Compelling viewing but a wee bit predictable
","Perhaps I am hard to please.  I thought this was a very good movie, one I enjoyed despite it being a genre that is not really to my taste.  It has, however, been lavished with such extreme praise that I feel motivated to calm the debate down a little with my comments.There is some fine acting; Spacey and Byrne in particular.  Pete Postlethwaite is incredibly sinister and quite unlike the stage actor I remember from the late 80's and early 90's when he walked the London boards. The pacing of the movie is good.  The use of flashback and forwards had its disorienting moments, but on the whole was very well done.The camera work is good, although some of the scenes in the dark where you cannot quite work out what is going on are a little too long.I found the plot a wee bit predictable.  It's hard to explain the shortcoming without spoilers; suffice it to say that such a plot is bound to have twists to it and by about half way through the movie it came down to two main possibilities, one of which is explored and eventually discredited, the other turns out to be the main twist.I'm glad I've seen this movie, would recommend it highly, even, but masterpiece it isn't.",Null,0,0,25 February 2003
Garden State," Slow but steady
","I stumbled across this film by accident on a flight last night. By accident, because it wasn't even listed on the movie choices for that flight!! But I'm very pleased with the serendipity, which was in keeping with the mood and tone of the movie.Ian Holm is the only actor in the film known to me - he is a great stage actor and plays his part in this movie well.I am impressed to learn that young Zach is not only the lead actor (who performs well) but also the creative force behind the script and direction.The reminders of Wes Anderson and Hal Ashby have been made elsewhere but occurred to me almost immediately on embarking on this films journey, so they bear repeating.And it is a bit slow. Throughout, actually.But heck, it is the lad's first movie, and it is a very good piece. Which must be a great sign for things to come. I for one will be looking out for his next.",8,0,1,20 March 2005
Groundhog Day," Very Good, but not the Greatest
","IMDB commentators seem to rate this movie up there with the very, very best. I think it is very good, but not the greatest.The idea of reliving the same day is unusual yet simple.  It does have a philosophical conundrum buried in it, but at heart this is a romantic comedy with a twist.  It is not philosophy sugar-coated as romantic comedy.  In other words, if you want a good philosophical think, read some Bertrand Russell instead.There are some very entertaining scenes - the bowling alley debate and the 'Thelma & Louise'-esque scene with Bill Murray and the groundhog especially coming to mind as 'laugh-out-louders'.If you haven't seen it, then treat yourself to an hour-and-a-half of escapism and laughter, because that's what Groundhog Day is.",7,0,7,23 September 2002
Reservoir Dogs," I don't mind the language, it's the beating I don't need
","I know that this film is highly regarded and that my adverse view is a minority one, but I found Reservoir Dogs unsubtle and uninteresting. 
I don't really like violent movies, but I liked Pulp Fiction, which I found clever and compelling.  Reservoir Dogs shows some signs of similar flair, but only the odd flicker of it.  The strong language I was promised was not particularly ripe - I learned no new ways of saying 'f*** you' having experienced the entire canon in Glengarry Glen Ross.  Indeed, Mamet does foul language better.  The introduction of the prefix 'mother' in Pulp Fiction took the language genre much further.  Mostly this film is distinguished only by the gratuitousness of its violence, which is disturbing at times, especially Mr Blonde's frenzy.  What little plot there is (and boy, is there little) didn't quite stack up for me, nor did it bring out any real complexity in the characters.I enjoyed the opening scene in the diner, haggling over the morality of tipping, but it was downhill from there for me.Good performances by Tim Roth and Harvey Keitel in particular.",6,5,10,2 July 2003
Sweet and Lowdown," Very watchable, very charming
","This is a very enjoyable movie.  It has many touches in it that are classic Woody Allen, so it should appeal to his many fans.  It is also so strong on the jazz material that it should appeal to jazz afficianados even if they are not Woody Allen fans.  The biographical / documentary styles keep this movie away from Woody's worst excesses (I am a fan, but not a blinkered one)and provide momentum. There are one or two scenes that migrate towards farce, such as the hold-up scene(s) and the 'moon seat'.This film is well worth seeing.",7,19,21,29 May 2003
Amélie," Most unusual, well worth seeing
","It is a real rarity for me these days to see a film that I find genuinely original or unusual.  But this really is one such film.  It is also charming, funny and spell-binding.  Yes, some of the surrealism grates a little, but the film moves so gracefully through its paces that the rare jolting moment is soon forgotten.  Lots of memorable scenes and events - probably a film worth seeing more than once as there is so much going on, especially for those of us who need subtitles.This really is a super film - well worth seeing.",9,0,2,27 May 2003
