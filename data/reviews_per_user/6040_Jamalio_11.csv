Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," TACKY SCI-FI WHICH FORCES YOU TO 'LOSE HOPE'
","The plot of this film is practically incomprehensible. What I can understand of  it involves Anakin Skywalkers' (later to become Darth Vader) attempts at becoming a Jedi Knight, which we all know aint gonna happen. George Lucas' direction is as rusty as C3PO on absinthe. The last notable film he made was The Adventures of Howard the Duck, which isn't exactly the best film ever made. Whats' so surprising about it though is just how dated it is next to the originals, and his attempts at spicing up the technology (double headed lightsabres) only contradicts the original trilogy as it is set BEFORE those times, not AFTER. A good idea would be to have Lucas hire a different director for the next two (which of course he's not) as he is so out of touch with modern film making its' embarrassing (Jar Jar Binks would even be unfunny in a bad 80s' sci-fi film) and the tackiness of the whole film means it looks more like an episode of Stargate or Babylon 5 than the classically constructed originals 3/10.",Null,1,2,18 January 2002
Fight Club," Just don't talk about it.
","Edward Norton plays Jack, a man who has been pushed over the edge by a mundane job, a mundane life, and a mundane world. His mundane job is a car sales rep, which means he has to travel from place to place on single serving' flights to distribute his (anonymous) car company, which is revealed to have more than a couple of corrupted tricks up their sleeve in an attempt to boost their over inflated salaries. Jack, who appears as a man smart enough to realise the emotionally unrewarding life he has entailed, attends self help groups as an attempt at catharsis, in which he gradually encounters Marla Singer (a cast against type Helena Bonham Carter) at groups that specialise in the emotional recovery of Testicular Cancer (she has no right to be there, but  then again, neither does he) as the depression he suffers from this mundane lifestyle causes him to suffer great depression which results in insomnia. He then meets the charismatic Tyler Durden (played with real grittiness by Brad Pitt, who revels himself in the films' subject matter) and Jacks' condo, on his return, is (mysteriousley) blown to pieces. He calls Tyler for a place to stay, the two develop a strange bond with a fisticuffs match, and- deciding how therapeutic it has proved for them, decide to organise an underground fight club' in which men forget about their emotional pain by experiencing it in the physical sense. But loss of physical control leads to loss of mental control, and the group soon becomes an all out product of destructive vandalism as they attack big, corporate money makers that distort the purity of a good honest lifestyle with this is how you should live' ideals- which they promote shamelessly to fulfill their own sense of greed (similar to Jacks' position as a car rep) that were responcible for contributing to Jacks' isolation and depression in the first place and from his natural instincts and masculinity.To say that Fight Club is a Taxi Driver of these times is a fitting comparison yet is also a disregard for its' unique, subversive power. It is a film that is every bit a study on how men have lost their sense of masculinity as materialistic society deprives them of their primal instincts by blurring the line that seperates men from the materialistic desires of the average (and idealistic) woman. As such, it is quite simply a mans' film (girls who claim to like it probably only do so because it stars Brad Pitt) as it has a degrading perspective towards women- Marla Singer is treated as a rough sex object that obscures Jacks' recovery from his rebirth as a real man'.  What prevents this film from being an offensive assault on the senses is it's stream of black comedy that buries itself beneath the chaos and disorder like a creeping disease- a fittingly ironic happy ending' sums the film up perfectly, and the twist, although at first incomprehensible, sums up the conditions of modern life's attributes of destroying a mans ethics; existential confusion of moral masculine instincts and self identity quite brilliantly 10/10.",Null,0,2,17 January 2002
Memento," HARD TO FORGET
","This is an inventive spin on the film noir genre. The character is set in a world of dark uncertainty where no one can be trusted because he cannot remember who the hell they were to begin with. All the characters who you believe are trustworthy are deceptive, and all the characters who aren't trustworthy might be, although you never get to find out. The narrative itself is layed out in the style of Leanords' thinking patterns, so the audience gets to understand and empathise with his condition. There is also a touching subtext about identifying with yourself by looking in the mirror and remembering what you've accomplished, in trusting others by remembering if they've hurt your feelings or have helped you out in some way, by knowing and understanding the past with written literature (his notes/tatoos), gaining emotional feelings like guilt and happiness with the passing of time through memories, and being told the things you want to be told and remembering what you want to remember, rather than hearing  (and remembering) the truth. The fact that writer/director Chris Nolan manages to fit all these aesthetics into the films' running time with a narrative that is completely unique is quite an accomplishment. The narrative itself isn't actually ground breaking- it's a style which suits the film's concept perfectly and may therefore only influence films which have a similar theme (to adopt this style of narrative to a film that has nothing to do with these themes would be completely pointless). A film that once seen will never be forgotten 9/10.",Null,0,1,24 January 2002
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," A FITTING END TO THE STAR WARS SAGA
","Ewoks. They are little blighters, arent they? They're small, cute and cuddly, and manage to destroy the evil empire by making weird noises and setting up traps. Most people probably hate them, and I believe they do. But this is no reason to hate this film, it's still a classic and contains some of the best scenes in the entire trilogy (the final fight between Luke and papa Vader is the best) and is a far better balanced film than Empire, there are some quite touching scenes, and the narrative is nice and varied (it starts with Laya rescuing her bit on the side' Solo then the battle between the ewoks and stormptroopers then the confrontation between Luke, Vader and that wizard guy, the Emperor). The battle with the ewoks itself is the perfect way to round things up, it shows that the battle between technology and the more organically human (despite the fact that they look like freaks and talk gibberish) will always be won as long as there is determination, friendship and teamwork involved, as well as the temptation to avoid joining the dark side (isn't this what Star Wars is all about?) George Lucas says that this is his favourite episode, although I consider the guy a freak after The Phantom Menace 8/10.",Null,0,1,24 January 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," I LIKE THIS FILM, IT'S NICE.
","This is a very good film. It has dwarves, elves, a wizard, a mountain and monsters. It also has people throwing axes and bows at each other. I'm not sure if it has magic potions though, I can't quite remember, because the film was very long (over 3 hours I believe). It has an evil wizard, Christopher Lee, who looks like an old hippy. It has a ring (obviousley, because it is called Lord of the Rings') which holds some kind of secret to eternity (or something like that, I wasn't paying attention). It has Liv Tyler. You should watch it. I rate this film ten out of ten, because I like it.",Null,0,0,23 January 2002
The Elephant Man," An unlikeley yet compelling follow up to 'Eraserhead.
","This tells the devastating yet highly rewarding tale of John Merrick, a child born with a deformed physical disease on account of his mother being attacked whilst impregnating him, and consequently earned the nick name the Elephant Man.' David Lynch's directorial follow up to Eraserhead couldn't be less predictable- this is every bit a mainstream film, with the occasional flash of stylistic Joi de Vivre' that occupied the entire narrative of Eraserhead (industrial noise, abstract/nightmarish imagery of deformed faces).  The film loses a hint of perfection on account of its' slightly choppy editing (and too many fade outs) which makes it feel incomplete, but otherwise, this portrayal of a human being doomed to a constant freak show' attraction by exhibitionists (those who care for him are just as guilty as those who don't) is likely to reduce the most hardened viewer to tears 9/10.",9,0,0,17 January 2002
Mulholland Drive," YES, IT IS BETTER THAN 'LOST HIGHWAY' AND NEARLY AS GOOD AS 'BLUE VELVET'.
","After the debacle of Lost Highway, and the 'experiment' with conventions of The Straight Story, Lynch returns to the 'deceptiveley equillibrium' sub genre reminiscent in his best films (Twin Peaks, Blue Velvet) and achieves something 'resembling' a film which blows the senses, and proves once again that he may not be the best director, but is easily the single greatest auteur in cinematic history. What proves a sigh of relief after the atrocious Lost Highway (yes, Lynch fans, it's up there with 'Dune') is that the humour is intact- in fact, for the first half, this resembles very much 'a David Lynch' comedy' (and Lynch is obviousley a man with an extraordinary sense of humour). He directs from the heart here, returning to personal values instead of uninspired madness (Lost Highway again) making a mockery of the film industry (he's had problems financing his films for the past ten years) set in LA, but could just as easily be Hollywood. The performances are great, many scenes are sheer classic (an 'unexpected' assassination attempt gone wrong will have you rolling in the aisles with laughter), and the final 30 mins. are probably the most 'out there' that Lynch has ever been. The only flaw here is accidental- this was intended to be a pilot for a TV series, but the production company Lynch showed this to didn't approve (one of the greatest tragedies in TV history- this could've easily outshone Twin Peaks) resulting in the material he had having to convert it into a feature film. It looks unbalanced, the first half is mildly uncinematic (but still very effective), but as a whole this film is still amongst the directors greatest work, and could easily be the best independent film of the year.",Null,1,2,15 January 2002
Scream 2," IS BETTER THAN THE FIRST ONE.
","I like this film, it is better than the first one. There is more blood. There are more killings- which is a fun thing to watch in horrows film. I like the woman who plays the TV reporter, she is funny and is an atractive woman. The ending is nice 7/10.",Null,0,0,23 January 2002
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," THE ORIGINAL AND BEST
","There is a force present in the first film of this saga that is absent in the others- humour. A New Hope is a film made in the tradition of the greatest 70s' films- casual, leisurely and stylish. Note the scene when Han Solo is disguised as a Storm Trooper, and when contacted by one of the security guards over something resembling a transmitter, Solo says- situation is great, everything is fine, I'm fine thankyou. How are you?' The security guard replies- who the hell is this?' Solo blows up the transmitter, then concludes in the subtlest of ways (to himself) boring conversation anyway'. An obviousley improvised scene (and who'd have thought that in an episode of the Star Wars saga?) there are no moments of this spontaniety in the other films. Its' with this humour, a subtle level of camp, and the sense of Joi De Vivre you get from witnessing something truelly spectacular unfolding before your eyes with the perfect sensibility of avoiding over ambition that makes this easily the best film of the saga. The characterisation is clearly spot on (Han solo is easily way cooler here than in the other episodes) and there is not a dull moment in sight. It's easy to see why this makes everyone's top ten lists of greatest films of all time 10/10.",Null,0,0,18 January 2002
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," LOOK OUT!! PRETENTIOUS REVIEW BELOW.
","To many, this is the best of the saga, mainy because it concludes aspects of a New Hope and sets up the action for what commences with Jedi. But it feels like the coldest (yet is also the most mature) of the saga. It easily betters Jedi (although it's not quite as complete) but rejects the niave charm of a New Hope in favour of operatic grandeur. It is easily the most serious, even including some bizarre Freudian imagery (the dream sequence when Luke chops Vaders' head off, the mask dissappears, and Lukes' face appears underneath) and some genuine wisdom from a little green thing called Yoda (Do or do not- there is no try'). The humour is almost completely absent and lacks the leisureley pace of the first film, and the sense of drama doesn't meld too well with some of the wooden one liners. But what does make it a very near standout of the saga is the levels to which it brings the good vs. evil' concept to- here, Luke is seen as a confused figure of identity, and the revelation that Vader is his father (I presume all of you have seen this anyway- no spoilers here) is completely devastating to someone who believes that goodness, purity and heroism manifests itself so strongly within him that something as evil as Vader couldn't possibly be his father. The fact that Vader tries to corrupt Luke the same way he himself was corrupted, but Luke manages to refuse the temptation of power- shows that evilness is a form of corruption rather than something which we carry in our blood. And did you see any of these valuable issues raised in the Phantom Menace? No. Do you know why that particular film sucks when compared to this one? You should do by now. This is the adult, more grown up interpretation of what Star Wars is all about, and is whithout a doubt the least compromised  9/10.",Null,0,0,23 January 2002
The Wizard of Oz," WHAT A WONDERFUL FANTASY FILM!!
","The plot of this film is very complicated, I couldn't understand why a lion, a tin man and a scarecrow could talk. But I liked the dog. The witch was scary, but the wizard was a very nice man, he helped dorothy and the others on their quest. I like the midgets, they are very nice. I give this film 9/10 because of this.",Null,0,1,23 January 2002
