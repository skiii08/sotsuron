The New World," Beautiful scenery mixed with bad sound
","In order to say something good about this movie, I will first say the location was great, the scenery was beautiful, and the soundtrack was one of the few things I could hear clearly. Not to take anything away from Colin, he needs to learn to deliver his lines without mumbling and in the general direction of the mic. The leading lady was a real gem and once she learns to speak up will hopefully replace some of the plastic leading ladies that are out in Hollywood today. OK, I admit my dislike of the movie was pretty much based on the sound, some of the acting, and lack of action. If you want a good movie in this genre, check out 'BlackRobe' which a far better movie.",6,0,3,5 June 2006
