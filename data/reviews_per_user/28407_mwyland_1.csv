Ali," Great Movie Making
","This is great movie making at it's best.  Michael Mann has a style and attitude that we see no where else.  Amazing stuff.  If you were bored by this movie, then you have no appreciation of what great direction is.  And you have a short attention span, which is indicative of STUPIDITY.I hate boxing, but I loved this movie.  This movie isn't about Will Smith (who I also hate,) it's about the director.  This is a beautifully made film despite the casting choices and historical inaccuracies.",Null,0,0,29 November 2002
