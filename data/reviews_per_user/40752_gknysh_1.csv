3:10 to Yuma," Distinct masterpieces
","This is NOT a genuine remake of the 1957 classic, but an entirely different movie, which introduces a large number of original elements(e.g. Peter Fonda as the grizzled bounty hunter, the mining camp incidents, the proactive 14-year-old son of 'Dan Evans', the dangerous trek through Apache country, etc.,etc., etc.), lasts noticeably longer, and changes some of characters of the Ford-Heflin Yuma almost beyond recognition (the tortured and lame ex-soldier Evans (Christian Bale) of 2007 is quite different from Heflin's solidly sympathetic 1957 farmer, and 'Evans'' 2007 wife has practically nothing in common with the luminously moving 'Alice Evans' of 1957 (Leora Dana), while Russell Crowe's violently psychopathic second-in-command Ben Foster (much admired by most commentators for his performance) is worlds apart from the coolly pragmatic thug played by Richard Jaeckel in 1957. Ford and Crowe are closest as 'Ben Wade', though the latter's exudes more quiet evil (as well as more talent and mystery) and seems occasionally far more Machiavellian.That said, both movies were extremely enjoyable experiences for me (I played my DVD of the 1957 film a few hours after watching Crowe and company at our local cinema,and went to sleep with much contentment thereafter). The first Yuma was and remains a classic, deservedly so. Will the second Yuma become one? It could, if some of its ambiguities are satisfactorily resolved by critics and viewers alike.",8,0,1,14 September 2007
