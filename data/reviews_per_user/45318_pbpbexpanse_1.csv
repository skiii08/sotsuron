War Dogs," Homework for me
","I enjoyed this interpersonal drama based around weapon dealing. The introduction was great. I found Jonas hills character who was a real life stupid person annoying. I kept thinking, ' why is this guy shooting himself in the foot.' Additionally what these guys did I didn't feel was illegal. Why punish them. They didn't hurt anyone at least as far as the movie showed. Now I need to do research about the actual facts. Sometimes I hate movies 'based on actual events' because it gives me homework.",7,0,0,18 April 2017
