Hereditary," A genuine headache
",This seems legit horror movie by the trailer and the ratings everywhere but it is a complete SCAM. One will feel like escape this crap. Complete disappointment with the direction. The first half doesn't build up any storyline and the climax is disheartening.Not a single HORROR scene in the whole movie.,2,1,4,24 June 2018
