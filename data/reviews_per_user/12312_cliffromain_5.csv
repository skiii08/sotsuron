The Avengers," Summer Blockbuster
","Well what I found so humorous was one of my female cousin text and said 'Did you see The Avengers?'. Mind you she's not into Marvel movies at all and thought that was an excellent movie. You know I had to go see it even more. What's great about The Avengers, you don't have to see the other Marvel movies to follow the plot. However, it would be helpful to have a vague knowledge on each superhero. The Avengers makes me want to go back to my library to review the other Marvel movies I saw to put the puzzle together. I was rattling my brain when I saw Samuel Jackson and couldn't recall which Marvel flicks he was in. All the superheros got a fair amount of spot light, unpredictable plot, tones of actions, over 2 hours, and excellent visual effects. This will be a great introduction to Marvel characters to those who aren't accustomed to such genre and a great way for the ladies to impress their mates.",7,1,5,24 June 2012
American History X," racism
","American History X is a profound movie that should be seen by all, especially those of us who are racist. Derek has shown that racism is an idea that is instill into to us, and we have no concept about it and/or experience. Derek has changed his thought about African American after interacting with an African American in jail. The irony about this is that he would have never befriend a black person if it wasn't the opportunity he had to goto jail. Fortunately for him he came out a reformed man. Majority of these youths who are incarcerated come out with a phd for whatever they went in for. Danny, Derek's brother, looks up to his older brother and followed his foot step. This has showed us that racism is a cycle that starts from your ancestors and continues to your predecessors. We all can take a page from this movie to reevaluate our preconception about another race, culture, ethnicity and gender.",Null,0,1,10 September 2011
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Confusion is all cleared up
","The Lord of the Rings were on equal scale as Harry Potter. However, If you've missed the first Harry Potter you aren't as quite enthusiastic to continue to watch the remaining series. The Hobbit DEFINITELY clarified the following journeys. I now want to go back to watch all three - The Lord of the Rings.This epic is captivating to all age group. My fianc√©e and I sat in the theater for close to three hours and were craving for more. It's sad how this is the last story of the beginning. We didn't watch this movie in 3D but felt as we were part of this majestic journey. One thing I can say we were wishing for is a little bit more humor through the journey. Peter Jackson has definitely put his magical touch in this master piece. I'm definitely looking forward to see how he can continue to rekindle the child that is in each one of us. This is a must see for the whole family.",8,4,10,17 December 2012
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Mission accomplished
","I thought this was MI 3 (laugh). At the end of the movie, I said to my girlfriend 'get ready for MI 4'. I'm happy she didn't catch that. Could Tom Cruise fail us? I don't think so. From the beginning of the movie the action was right on point. Keep in mind this movie is over 2 hours, I wanted more when the movie ended. What really got me about some of these stunts, was that Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) never got hurt. Whoa! Please make the super hero human. The title 'Ghost protocol' - isn't he always chasing a phantom? The plot was magnetized, until we knew why he was chasing the Ghost. What's great about this MI is that you don't have to see the other sequels in order to understand MI4. Great movie for couples.",7,3,9,24 December 2011
Drive," The Perfect Heist
","This movie should be called 'The Perfect Heist' NOT Driver. Ryan Gosling played the perfect get away driver. Unfortunately this movie came short. Like in most heist movies, you can figure out the plot, well this is it. Small time thugs committing robberies and ended up in a jam, everything snowball afterward. Ryan's personal life has caused chaos to everyone around him. What I was hopping from him is to get out before it's too late. Most career criminals don't know when to bail out. These situations leave you with only three options jail, dead, or retirement.This movie seems to drag a little, him falling in love with one of his partner in crime wife and others chasing after him. At one moment where the driver seems to be out smarting everyone and other times he seems to be too violent. Most of these movies seems to leave a message. The only thing I got from this is how one person's life seems to ruin a lots of lives. The plot was obvious and action kept me on the edge of my seat. However, if the story line had a meaning behind it, a little twist to the move, it would've gotten a better review from me. I was hopping it falls into the classics but it's still a great movie to see.",6,0,2,15 October 2011
