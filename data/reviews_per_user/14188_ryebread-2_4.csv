The Blair Witch Project," As PUBLIC ENEMY once said so perfectly-Don't believe the hype! Boyeeeez!
","Oh boy, I think all of these glowing reviews for this movie are spawned by the wonderful workings of the hype machine. Once 'certain' moviegoers get it in their head that a movie is going to be great, and scary, and wonderful, and all of that -- they will almost be hypnotized into thinking the movie is all it is cracked up to be. They will walk out and parrot everything they've heard everyone else say -- because it's the concensus and it is easier than going against the grain. Right now, it is apparently 'hip' to really dig this movie, and say you've seen it and loved it. Well, believe me -- it is truly underwhelming. I think that is in understatement, but I do not know how else to put it.My severely edited version of the film:'I want to make a student film! You two are helping me.''Ok, pushy girl.''Oh no! We're lost!'(screaming): 'You @$$hole!''Oh my god, what is that!'(Viewer, responding): I don't know, I didn't see anything -- but I am supposed to think that it is 'intelligent' of the filmmakers to not let us see what is out there, because hey -- isn't that more scary?
'Oh no! We've lost one of our friends!'(weird voices from woods that sound suspiciously like student filmmakers)(more screaming)'Ahh, where'd the other guy go?'(guy dead in corner)THE ENDBooooring! This could've been 20 minutes long, and it would have been an excellent short film. But they stretched it out, and in between the So so opening and the Ok ending they put in a lot of crapola. Too much screaming, which is obviously the directors' strained attempts at coercing the audience into feeling tense and scared, and too much walking around feigning being lost.After watching the 'footage' (which was the scariest thing about the film -- because of how darn shaky and nausiating it was!), all I could ask myself was 'Wouldn't these idiots put down their cameras if they knew they were being hunted?' DUH! Come on! It was so obvious the filmmakers kept finding ways to make it plausable that they would continue shooting so that the 'being there' aspect would work. It didn't. Especially the part when the girl is shooting the left side of her face -- with a light on -- even after they had talked about not having any lights on so they wouldn't be found. I mean, it is so silly and utterly unrealistic to be filming yourself if you think you are going to die. Who the F- cares if it turns out cool in your student film project, that is if you make it out of the woods alive!? A thoroughly uninteresting film, and not scary at all! What is scary is that someone would actually call this one of the best horror movies ever. I even read that someone thought it was one of thhe best films ever!? There are far more scary films out there. Don't get me wrong, I think the 'realistic' horror film is far far scarier, and more respectable then the easy road of blood n' guts -- but this...this is just silly. Rent 'The Silence of the Lambs' - a truly scary film that doesn't even fall in the horror genre. Or possibly 'Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer,' or even 'Peeping Tom' These are scary films. Not this bad attempt at a student film.C'mon. Get real. Get over it. Don't believe the hype.",2,1,4,21 July 1999
Life Is Beautiful," A masterpiece. One of the top films of all time.
","The effectiveness of this tale is how the emotion hits you out of nowhere, instead of having it tug at your pantsleg throughout the entire film as some do. Whereas Schindler's List is a masterpiece and a gorgeous film in its raw power and gritty realism, Life is Beautiful works in how it deals with emotions on a much more personal level. The story of a father trying to shelter his son from all of the misery around him is brilliant and touching, and does NOT give the feeling that Benigni is 'making light' of the Holocaust. It is what any parent would want, and at the same time it also works a double function brilliantly: it shelters the audience from the horror that we know is going on outside of what we see. We don't see the effects of that horror until the films sense of building tension climaxes in the final moments, and the protagonist is taken away from his son and shot. The 'aftermath' scene is beautifully understated, and truly heart-wrenching, and all I could think was 'please let him get his tank.' And when the tank rolls around the corner, I began to weep. The final line 'This is the story of how my father saved my life,' was so simple, understated, and beautiful. Not only is life beautiful, but so is this film. It is irritating how so many these days try and compare films when they happen to share subject matter. When '1941' came out, no one complained and said that it was 'making light' of WWII, and tried to compare it to 'The Longest Day.' Come on people. (not that I am saying '1941' and 'Life is Beautiful' share a similar tone at all!) Anyways...a brilliant brilliant film. The scene where he puts on the record player is just lovely. True love is something to behold.",10,1,2,24 July 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," Visually beautiful. Both brilliantly conceived and expertly executed.
","This film definitely ranks among Kubrick's best. 'The scene,' is wonderful in how it doesn't exploit the human form, but rather caresses it, embraces it, and ultimately makes it into something nightmarish. The use of light and color is particularly amazing, the cinematography was dazzling, and the directing was nothing short of genius. The dialogue was tense and very spare -- but purposefully so, The same goes for the film's score. It is a brilliant piece of existential storytelling, and it is a shame that this will be Kubrick's last. But, oh what a way to go out!",8,0,0,17 July 1999
Donnie Darko," The role Patrick Swayze was born to play!! (yes, that IS a good thing)
","A wonderful film. Jake Gyllenhall is stunning as Donnie. As its base level, a film about growing up and feeling out of place amongst your own friends and family, and feeling strange in your own skin. At its most complex: time travel & messages from God.The film is ambiguous, but wonderfully so. We have no idea how Donnie does it, or if he even does. We don't know if Frank is God, with Donnie seeing his future through the humanly form of Frank.Yes, this movie is bizarre, but truly beautiful on every level. Highly recommended.
