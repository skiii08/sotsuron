The Blair Witch Project," The filmmakers refuse to pay their dues...
","...so we, the viewers, have to pay them instead.  That, I think, lies at the heart of the many chants of 'worst movie ever made' from BWP's detractors. It's also one of the reasons the film will stay in the heads of its fans for days, and why those fans won't shut up about it.The problem is that not everyone is used to art which doesn't readily explain itself, which makes the viewer work at interpreting it.  Two practitioners of this type of art in other fields are the writer William S. Burroughs and the composer John Cage.  Some famous movies which do the same kind of thing are 'L'Avventura', 'Last Year at Marienbad', '8 1/2', and 'Blow-Up'.  Some people can't stand these films, others can't live without them.  What they have in common with BWP is that they put the viewers' minds to work, filling in the deliberate gaps in the plot and unexplained areas. While a lot of people dote on films like this that 'make them think', others don't appreciate being put to work when they've come to be entertained.A better precedent for BWP is 'David Holzman's Diary', which purports to be a young filmmaker's attempt to turn his life into a film (and which also aroused strong negative reactions from viewers who felt cheated by its not being 'real').  Some have asked why the students kept filming after losing all control over events.  The answer is that, like David Holzman, they found the act of recording their experience on film was the only way to impose order and meaning upon the experience.Alfred Hitchcock, I think, said something to the effect that drama was just real life 'with all the dull parts removed.'  BWP does have some admittedly dull parts, and its detractors have seized upon these as proof of its badness.  Others have cited the repetitive dialogue, and the arguments that run in as many circles as the students themselves.  One could also argue, though, that these devices enhance the veracity of the film (at least on an emotional level--we all know it's not 'real', right?).  Along with the fact that almost all the shots are point-of-view, they give the impression of actually being inside the film while it's happening.  This is another reason the film arouses so much enthusiasm.While remarkable in its own way, too much has been made of BWP's Web-driven publicity campaign.  If anything, the hype might have been too effective, in that it attracted (along with the curious film intellectuals) a number of people unsympathetic to this type of film.  On the bright side, it seems to have swept in quite a few people who, without knowing it, have been waiting all their lives to see something like this.  This is the kind of fan most likely to declare BWP their all-time favorite film, the best horror film since 'The Exorcist', etc.  One hopes they will get equal enjoyment out of Burroughs, Cage, and 'L'Avventura'!For my part, I admit I don't see many regular horror films (though in retrospect I'm reminded that many landmarks of the genre, including 'Cat People', 'Psycho', 'Night of the Living Dead', and 'The Texas Chain Saw Massacre' were also made on low budgets, if not micro-budgets), but do enjoy art that makes the viewer work a little.  I enjoyed BWP for all the reasons listed above, along with several images and sequences I expect to stay with me a long time.  Like a dog trying to get the last bit of meat off a bone, my mind keeps worrying at these scenes, trying to impose meaning on it all.This reminds me of how a conventionally-trained classical violinist tried out an avant-garde piece by Charles Ives and hated it, saying that if you swallowed something that disagreed with you, you could take something to get rid of it, but that he (the violinist) couldn't get these awful sounds out of his ears.  I wonder if some of the negative reactions to BWP might come from people unwillingly carrying it in their heads for days, weeks, maybe even months.BWP isn't my favorite film of all time, but I prefer it to all the other films I've seen so far this year.  I can imagine seeing better films this year, but the filmmakers are going to have to work a little to please me. (Heh, heh.)",9,1,2,3 November 1999
Chicken Run," One radical cartoon
","The great animation director Chuck Jones has often stated that his cartoons 'weren't made for children.  Neither were they made for adults.  They were made for me.'  Jones's seven-minute shorts were made on a far lower budget than the animated features of today.  With features, much more money is at stake, as well as the livelihoods of more people.  Because of the pressure to make back the investment, animated features can give an impression of being created by committee, as though tailored to fit some committee's idea of a prefabricated audience segment.  It's remarkable, then, that Aardman Animation's 'Chicken Run' shows off so much personality, the mark of a film made not for an imagined mass audience, but because it satisfied some need for the filmmakers-besides the need to put food on the table, that is.The story revolves around an English egg farm designed a lot like a WWII-era prison camp, with overtones of the Nazi concentration camps as well, in that chickens that don't produce end up as dinner.  While most of the chickens are resigned to their fate, one plucky hen named Ginger keeps leading escape attempts and keeps getting locked in 'solitary' for her pains.  Her task takes on new urgency when the Tweedys (the couple who run the farm) prepare to convert their operation into a chicken-pie factory.  Hope arrives in the form of an American known (amusingly, in view of the recent 'Rocky & Bullwinkle' film) as 'Rocky the Flying Rooster', whom Ginger thinks can teach the chickens how to fly.  Naturally, Rocky isn't really what he seems to be, and the revelation of his secret threatens to dash all hope of escape, because everyone knows chickens can't fly-or can they?Unlike most cartoon films, 'Chicken Run' is animated using clay figures in stop-motion.  While this process involves much more labor than drawn animation, it also makes easier the use of many of the tools of live-action filmmaking, such as dramatic lighting and moving camera work.  Directors Peter Lord and Nick Park both have considerable experience in this field, Park with 'Creature Comforts' and the 'Wallace & Gromit' series (perhaps the most popular animated shorts of the 1990's) and Lord as a co-founder (with David Sproxton) of Aardman and director of such shorts as 'Adam', 'Wat's Pig', and 'Early Bird'.The look of 'Chicken Run' displays a harmonious blending of Park's and Lord's strengths; the character designs have the cartoony look of Park's work, while the more realistic settings and backdrops (which appear subject to grime and weathering) are typical of those in Lord's films.  All the major characters are distinctive and believable on their own terms; even the numerous chickens have their own distinct looks and voices.  The only times the illusion of believability fails are when a clay chicken collides with a metal fence; I half expect to see the clay figure sliced up on the way through.  (This may be a personal reaction, conditioned by years of exposure to 'Tom & Jerry' and 'Roadrunner/Coyote' cartoons.)  The story moves efficiently and contains much humor and detail that reward close attention, as well as bravura set-pieces such as Rocky and Ginger's dramatic encounter with the Tweedys' pie machine.While it has justifiably been compared with military prison-camp escape movies such as 'Stalag 17' and 'The Great Escape', as well as with the revisionist farm-animal melodrama 'Babe', the movie 'Chicken Run' resembles most is Pixar's computer-animated 'A Bug's Life'.  The resemblence lies partly in certain details of plot (such as the hero[es] who isn't/aren't what he/they seem to be) but mostly in the nature of the story itself. While human prisoners have a life before prison upon which to look back upon, the chickens in this movie have never known such freedom.  Thus, when Ginger talks of escape, she not only urges them to change their location but their entire way of thinking.  In chicken terms, this is a radical message, the same one put forth by all the great human radical organizers: that those who are exploited have a right to expect a better life.  Though the species and the methods of exploitation are different, 'A Bug's Life' shares this revolutionary message (with Flik playing the radical visionary part).  Both movies also stress the importance of banding together against oppressors whose power turns out to be more apparent than real.While one could quibble about such commonalities, I'm impressed that two such films exist at all, that they were funded by major Hollywood studios (Disney for 'A Bug's Life', Dreamworks for 'Chicken Run'), and that kids love them and parents don't mind watching them more than once.  One wonders if the parents know exactly what it is they're watching, and letting their kids watch.  Then again, maybe they, too, believe they and their children deserve better lives, and enjoy seeing fellow victims of exploitation get such a life in the end.",7,20,28,10 July 2000
Sleepy Hollow," Not perfect, but very, very close
","First of all, the so-so parts: While Christina Ricci's cool portrayal of Katrina gives the character an appropriately otherworldly aura, she really could have used more fire at emotional moments.  Some scenes are unduly rushed, including a few with crucial exposition, making the plot hard to follow at some points.  Finally, Danny Elfman's music is too intrusive at times, distancing viewers when they should be drawn in.That's ALL that's wrong with this picture; everything else is perfect or nearly so.  Tim Burton's films are always visually rewarding, and this one has terrifically moody atmosphere.  Having lived in hilly, wooded areas close to rivers and creeks, I can testify that there are indeed places that look and feel a lot like the Sleepy Hollow of this movie.  Many scenes have so little color that they might almost as well be in black-and-white; this makes the few splashes of color (flames, witchcraft symbols, and of course blood) much more striking.  One understands how the movie got an Oscar for art direction.The plot, which as you probably know varies drastically from Washington Irving's original story, is diabolically complex and closer to a mystery/thriller than horror as such.  It reminded me of the fiction of Avram Davidson, a noted fantasist with a penchant for complex mystery plots.Anyway, back to the movie.  Except for the rushed scenes alluded to above, Burton handles the plot (perhaps the most complex in any of his movies) with exceptional grace, dropping in telling visual details along the way that come back in unexpected places later on.  I especially liked the underlying theme about science vs. superstition, and note that while many details of this particular case lie beyond the realm of science, it is still science and reason that crack the case open in the end.  The bits of ca. 1800 cutting-edge (so to speak) technology were fascinating as well; my favorites were the magic lantern that threw lighted shapes on the walls, and the thaumatrope toy which combined pictures of a bird and a cage.  (It's probably not a coincidence that both of these are ancestors to the motion picture.)Finally, I loved Johnny Depp's performance as Ichabod Crane.  Even though the character's situation and background were quite different from Irving's version, Depp, Burton, and scriptwriters Kevin Yagher and Andrew Kevin Walker remain true to the spirit of the original Ichabod Crane.  He could almost be a Buster Keaton-type character, an awkward wimp who accomplishes great feats of derring-do by the end of the movie, and for me Depp's portrayal recalls 'Sherlock, Jr.', in which Keaton dreams that he is the world's greatest detective.  Even though Irving wrote no sequels to 'Sleepy Hollow', I'd love to see more of this film version of Ichabod Crane; while the movie looks great and has a terrific script, it's Depp and Crane who put it over the top.",6,63,118,31 March 2000
The Shawshank Redemption," Not the greatest, but too good to miss
","To partially repeat myself, 'The Shawshank Redemption' is not the greatest film of all time.  On the other hand, it isn't standard-brand Hollywood product either.  Instead, like 'Casablanca', 'Shawshank' is Hollywood product raised to extraordinary levels through the mutual effort of craftspeople operating at peak levels.  The acting, direction, camera work, editing, set design, and music all contribute, but none of these carry the film alone.  The script, however, is the one indispensable element that the others rest upon, and it is the script upon which I want to concentrate. Not the plot, mind you--if you don't know already, it's a prison drama in which many terrible and wonderful things happen.  Such stories can be told in many ways, but I especially admired the ways director/scripter Frank Darabont chose to convey Stephen King's original story.Examples include patterns set up early in the film, such as the pro forma speech 'Red' (Morgan Freeman) gives each time he faces the parole board, or apparent throwaway details that come to unexpected life as the plot thickens.  The pacing is excellent, keeping viewers interested over the film's length (well over 23 hours) by punctuating the story's progress not only with the incidents of brutal violence one expects from a prison film, but also moments of unexpected grace.Finally, it's interesting to note that in the year 'Pulp Fiction' received so much hoo-rah over the ways writer/director Quentin Tarantino played with the movie's internal time, Darabont got little credit for doing some of the same things in 'Shawshank', such as depicting the same sequence of events from different viewpoints when approaching the film's climax.  (Not that 'Pulp Fiction' is less than brilliant, but 'Shawshank''s approach to its own internal time was equally artful, if less flashy.)The only things I could fault this film for are being manipulative, as well as more than a little predictable in the last 15 minutes or so.  However, the previous 2 hours are so compelling, and set up so much emotional momentum, that it would take a titanic (if not 'Titanic') sized object to drag the film down.There's a great deal more to be said about the ways everyone involved--actors, set designers, musicians, etc.--does their part to bring 'Shawshank' to life, but someone else will have to say it.  Discover this treasure for yourself.",9,0,0,15 October 2000
X2: X-Men United," Very, very good
","There's not a lot I can add to what's been said about 'X2', but I did want to kick in my short personal take on the movie.  Even though I'm not an effects maven, the variety and sheer visual wonder of the effects in 'X2' bowled me over.  They wouldn't have been as worth watching, however, if Bryan Singer & co. hadn't balanced them off with effective character sequences as well.  Though these aren't necessarily up to the level of those in a good movie for grown-ups, they make the film come closer to capturing the 'soap-opera' appeal of the X-Men comic than the first movie did. Superhero movies seem to be steadily improving, so to call this one 'the best in the genre' isn't exactly an original tactic.  Except maybe for last year's 'Spider-Man', though, 'X2' is as close to a classic film as the superhero genre has produced.",7,0,0,20 May 2003
The Matrix," Good of its kind
","There are some movies that, at least for me, look like they'd work better as a comic book (or 'graphic novel') than as a movie, that present an effective series of images but which raise untoward questions when real human actors have to convince viewers this is for real.  'The Fifth Element' and 'Men in Black' were two such movies--in fact, the former was partly designed by a comix artist, and the latter adapted from a comic book series.I know of no graphic forerunners for 'The Matrix', but I would group it with 'comic book movies' of this sort.  The good part is that it's quite a bit smarter than the usual CBM, with serious attention paid to the underpinnings of the plot and even an effort to get in some real science some of the time. The bad part is that the filmmakers haven't quite thought everything through.  (SPOILER WARNING: skip to the next paragraph if you don't want to read this.)  I liked very much Agent Smith's explanation of why the bad guys don't keep humanity complacent with a simulated utopia, chosing the late 20th century instead.  On the other hand, if they need human bioelectricity as an energy source--in other words, if it's strictly human bodies they need--why don't they just scrap the simulation and lobotomize everybody? (Is it possible that they need fully developed human minds for some other reason?  If so, why?)  If the filmmakers had at least addressed this question, it would have added some backbone to the plot, which needs all the support it can get.  Oh well, maybe they're saving it for the sequel.Otherwise, the standard strengths and weaknesses of CBM's apply here. Forget the gunplay, explosions, and other such mayhem--throw an egg anywhere in a multiscreen theater these days, and you've got even chances of splatting into a movie featuring these prominently.  Beyond that, 'The Matrix' contains more than its fair share of stunning images, some disturbing, some mindbending, and a few both.I had problems with the acting, though, or maybe it was the way the actors were directed.  When descending into the Matrix, the good guys show almost no emotions at all.  It's like since they know the Matrix isn't 'real', they can't be bothered having any feelings about it.  This fits with the plot, but makes it hard to identify with the characters.  (Fortunately, everyone seems more human on the ship, a special relief in the case of the excellent actor Laurence Fishburne.)The only actor to avoid this difficulty is Keanu Reeves, arguably because his character is struggling with the 'reality' of the Matrix over the course of the film.  You can almost watch him shedding emotions bit by bit as he gets control of the situation.  (Frankly, I think he's more convincing and compelling as a fallible but highly competent hero of the sort he played in 'Speed' than as a potential world-savior.)The upshot: a good but not great film, well worth watching for its unique and compelling parts, but (my usual complaint) not what it could have been.",2,1,5,3 September 1999
