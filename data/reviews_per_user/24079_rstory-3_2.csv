3:10 to Yuma," You have to be kidding.
","This starts with an iron clad stagecoach. How to you rob it. The outlaws throw dynamite between the gun slots of the stage. and a sniper kills all who are outside driving the team and manning a Gatling Gun. Why not just shot the horses. That simple. Also, pulling a armored stagecoach would exhaust any team of horse before they got 100 yards. The movie just goes down hill from there. It is not worth watching this foolish over the top remake of one of the most classic films ever made. See the original and know what a true western is.",1,1,3,19 June 2019
The English Patient," Adjectives for love
","Early in the film the subjects of adjectives comes up between the two people who begin the first romance in this film. The film then proceeds to demonstrate the many kinds of love a person may encounter. It matters not their wants, but what befalls them takes control. The adjectives mount up as their lives collide on courses they never dreamed of following. Romantic, lustful and enduring are some of the 'adjectives' that engulf them . Intense joy, hate and pain are the emotions these passions bring out. Sometimes the price is high, but with no regrets.The background is set just prior and through World War II. It is both a enemy and an ally to these lover's passions, but it has no strength against these passions. It enforces them.I have not read the novel, but script is superb. The characters are strong and you will see them grow as they navigate the mania of their desires. I will defend the indulgence of adjectives because that is the theme of this film and of my review.The script uses what is called flashbacks, but they seem more like dreams. The settings and the visual effects give these flashbacks this dreamlike quality.The settings switch from the vast expanse of the deserts of North Africa to a darkened interior of an enclosed truck cab. Sometimes in bright sunlight and then in the firelight of candles and campfires.The action is sharp and sudden. Not prolonged. It is meant to have an effect on the story and not be overwhelming. The performance of the cast is spot on.I would suggest watching this more. I know I needed to, so I could absorb all the detail this film has to offer.Enjoy",10,0,0,29 November 2019
