Casablanca," Here's lookin' at you kid...
","With a classic that mirrors a time period as well as Casablanca does, it really sets a standard as to what a romance drama should be, as well as a pretty tough movie for others to follow.  The dramatic story line of two lovers torn between uncontrollable circumstances is a touching one indeed, but instead of focusing on the obvious attention grabber, the love story, director Michael Curtiz added other elements to this movie such as current events to make for a movie that the audience could relate to better, and get a better perspective for what was happening in the world around them. 	Set in a little town in Morocco during WW11, Casablanca was a town for refugees to flee to  while in search of  exit visas in order to gain a new life.  Even with the fictional story, the history is true, which is something that audiences could watch and learn more about during a time when so much  chaos was about.  Not only that, but audiences today can watch Casablanca and get an idea of what people went through only a few decades ago.
Along with the history, the characters in this movie add a whole other element which makes it unforgettable.  Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman are one dynamic duo.  The chemistry between them is so intense, that one could only guess that the two were actually together.  Also, Bogart's tough guy persona keeps the audience guessing, one never knows exactly how he'll react to the situations he faces throughout the movie because the whole time he is battling a decision to do what he wants, or to do what's right.
All in all, this was an incredible movie.  From the history to the characters, everything was great.  There were no bad parts, all the elements tied together so nicely that classic is the only word to describe it, which is what the movie is, a classic.",Null,1,2,29 April 2004
Citizen Kane," alright movie
","Citizen Kane is considered by most to be the best motion picture ever made, for those who see it, it still inspires awe.  If the people who believe this are talking about the spectacular views and innovative camera angles, then yes, I agree, but otherwise, I could have done without seeing this movie. The simple plot line consists of a man on his deathbed, his final word, Rosebud. This man, Charles Foster Kane was a huge newspaper tycoon, who everyone either loved or hated.  As a memorial to him, a mini-motion picture is made depicting his life, but it is missing something.  The creators decide to throw in his final word, telling the audience what it meant.  Only problem is, as they talk to everyone who was ever close to Kane, his manager, Mr. Bernstien (Everett Sloane), his friend Jedediah Leland (Joseph Cotten), and his second wife Susan Alexander Kane (Dorothy Comingore), no one can help, no one knows what or who Rosebud is. Eventually the audience finds out, but the characters in the movie never do. Like I said, this is an excellent movie if you are talking about how Orson Welles filmed it.  He used new ways of getting a shot, like in the beginning of the movie where the audience sees the nurse come in to Kane's bedroom threw the shards of broken glass on the floor.  Or when light in Kane's bedroom is on, and then when he dies it fades out.  A really good technique Welles uses while filming was zooming in and out.  A great example of this is at the beginning of the movie when the camera is on the NO TRESPASSING sign on the front gate of Xanadu, after you see that shot, Orson zooms into everything on the grounds, then finally up to Kane's bedroom. Kudos to Orson Welles.  Not only did he star in `Citizen Kane,' but he also produced, directed, and helped write the screenplay.  Unfortunately, that's where all the compliments stop and the criticism begins.  Like the acting, everyone, for the most part, played his or her roles very casually.  It didn't seem like there was too much emotion going on in any one role.  When emotion did surface, it felt overdone and over exaggerated, like when Mrs. Susan Alexander Kane is yelling at her husband, her voice is too shrill for my ears and made me want to stop listening. If you were looking for a movie that has a lot of emotional value, `Citizen Kane,' would not be it.  However, if you were looking for a movie that is ahead of its time visually, you would be pleased as to what you would find in `Citizen Kane.'  All in all I would give this movie 6 out of 10 stars based only on Orson Welles excellent camera techniques.",Null,3,6,17 November 2003
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Not my favorite
","What can I say about this movie?  Hm..... I have a few words, like boring, pointless, unentertaining... just to name a few mind you.  Obviously, I didn't enjoy this movie, and that's an understatement.  Maybe I wouldn't go as far to say that this movie was pointless, because it did have a message, if you are intelligent enough to catch it, or that is was unentertaining, because to some people, other than myself, this was probably a great movie.Nevertheless, this is my review, so here it goes.  Rather than tell you all the things I didn't enjoy about this movie, and trust me, there are quite a few, I'm going to focus on the only thing worth mentioning, Peter Sellers. Honestly, he's the only reason I kept watching, the versatility he has with acting blew me away.  Playing three completely different characters, Group Captain Lionel Mandrake, U.S. President Merkin Muffley, and the hilarious former Nazi genius  Dr. Strangelove, Sellers captivates the audience with his range of talent.Not only did Sellers do an outstanding job with his characters, but the characters he portrayed were the most vital out of the whole movie.  The Group Captain, President, and Doctor, where the only characters capable of preventing the bombing of the U.S.S.R after General Jack Ripper orders his bomber wing to do the deed.   Captain Mandrake was the only person in contact with Jack Ripper, President Muffley was trying to reason with the Soviet President, while Dr. Strangelove knows exactly what is going to happen if the bomb does in fact drop.  So, do these three characters stop the bomb in time?  You're going to have to watch the movie",Null,2,5,13 March 2004
Some Like It Hot," like nitro and glycerin...
","Where would this world be without men dressing up like women?  After witnessing a mob hit, down-and-out musicians Joe (Tony Curtis) and Jerry (Jack Lemmon) do just that in order to escape from being the mob's next victims.  Having seen the storyline in previous movies, Some Like it Hot is still one hilarious movie.Dubbed `the best comedy of the year' when it was first released, the years since haven't taken away any of the wacky and clever humor that Some Like it Hot contains.  There is nothing wrong with this movie from what this reviewer could see.  The type of humorous antics pulled off, like men in dresses and a budding romance between a millionaire and Lemmon will keep a viewer rolling in their seats for the duration on the film.Lets talk about chemistry for a moment.  Not the kind you kind in the science room, but the kind between two people.  Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon had great chemistry together, they were like nitro and glycerin, together they were explosive!  They were what made the movie, sure, Marilyn Monroe did a great job with the `dumb blond' role, but it was the men in drag that kept the moving going.Again, this was a great movie.  Great actors and a humorous storyline come together to make Some Like it Hot a treat for the whole family.  Definitely living up to `the best comedy of the year' comment it received so many years ago.  Some Like it Hot is timeless humor and for that, it receives 10 out of 10 stars",Null,2,3,26 May 2004
Psycho," Roller Coaster Thrill Ride
","What an incredible movie!  Coming from a person who absolutely HATES scary movies, that's a lot to say.  Not to shoot down Psycho, it was an amazingly scary movie, it would have been even worse had I seen it back in the sixties when it first came out.  With the way the movie industry makes horror movies now a days,  with all the guts and gore, Psycho was definitely a head of it's time when it was released.Alfred Hitchcock was a talented director, a master of the macabre to say the least, and his quirky traits popped up here and there throughout Psycho. First off, as with his other movies, Hitchcock makes an appearance so look for him during the first fifteen minutes or so.   Another quirky characteristic was his obsession with the bathroom, or better yet with the words bowel movement.  This is evident with the initials of the Bates Motel. Idiosyncrasies  like these make and otherwise terrifying movie more enjoyable for the viewer because knowing Hitchcock's habits, they can look for these types of things throughout Psycho.  And definitely look for them, because there are a lot more things to pick up on than just the two mentioned above.  It's not just Hitchcock's eccentricities that make him a great director, his foreshadowing plotline and intense cinematography make it hard to beat. With the first appearance of the Bates Motel and mansion, you can tell bad things are going to ensue.  The hotel itself isn't all that scary, creepy yes, but not edge-of-your-seat terrifying.  Unlike the mansion, one look at the sinister house on top of the hill will send chills down your spine. Clearly something bad has happened or will happen there.  As for the notorious shower scene, the camera angles used allowed Hitchcock to create a truly chilling scene without all the guts and gore of today.All in all, this was a impressive movie for the time, one that all horror movies since should try to live up to.  Alfred Hitchcock created something truly  ahead of the time, a movie that no other horror movie can compare to, and for that I think it deserves ten out of ten stars.",Null,0,1,22 February 2004
The Godfather," Great Movie
","What makes for a good movie?  What elements do audiences look for in order to leave the theater sighing `that movie was great?'  To some, it's whether a character goes through a transformation, whether you can literally see a character evolve from one form to the next.  The Godfather is one such movie.  True, on the exterior what you see is a mafia family caught up in the new business of drug dealing and how they deal with a near fatal hit to `The Godfather' himself.   But if you take a second look, what you really see is the struggle between good and evil that one son must face upon the his return to the family home. 	When the movie opens, the audience is introduced to the character of Michael Corleone as played by the great Al Pacino.  Michael is what one would call a `golden child,' everyone in the family had high hopes for him.  They wanted him to become something great, and not get caught up in the family `business.'  In the beginning, he was something great, he was a war hero, returning home for a wedding.  Things take a toll for the worst when Michael's father, Don Vito played by Marlon Brando, is critically wounded during a mob hit.  At this point, the viewer starts to see a change in Pacino's character.  Putting family before all else, Michael gets sucked in to the `business,' seeking vengeance for his father. 	 Throughout the movie, Pacino's character transforms.  He makes the change from a flat character to a round in a very believably way thanks to the direction of Francis Ford Coppola and writer Mario Puzo.  The elements in the story of The Godfather support Pacino's change so that it's not out of the blue.  In that way, the audience can relate to the story better and even start to feel sorry for the mafia clan known as the Corleones, maybe even start to root for the bad guy, in hopes that the family can come out on top. The Godfather is a great movie, a must see, definitely an 11 on the 10 point scale.",Null,0,2,21 May 2004
