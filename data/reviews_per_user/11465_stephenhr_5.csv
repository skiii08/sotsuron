Requiem for a Dream," 4 nice folks find self destruction in drugs
",Anyone who toys with drugs or thinks they are harmless should see this movie.  It's a movie peopled with folks who do not have much going but they are pleasant enough and attractive.  Each brushes up to drugs in a different way.  Slowly they hollow out their lives and descend into the anti-world.  The world is populated with the dregs of humanity and there are no redeemers.  I will not forget it.  Very lonely and powerfully told tale with an energy uncommon in film.   The editing and cinematography are superb.  A complete telling of the story of using drugs.,10,0,0,21 September 2001
The Polar Express," SEE ONLY IN 3d-IMAX !!!
","An experience. The 3D treatment supports the experience of the story not the other way around. I was involved on a different level. I relaxed and enjoyed the spectacle, came out thinking it was well done, tasteful, and memorable. The adapted story is first rate. The animation has a unique style that works and is pleasant. It's not a frenzy of action in search of a soul, but a story well told. This will play for years and years during the holiday season and is the first truly narrative feature quality and length I-MAX presentation that I've seen. In the hands of a master story teller, 3d-IMAX is experienced as a more total immersion into the story. 3d as a feature of the medium is blended into the other elements that support the telling of the film story and becomes another almost unnoticed element of film. SEE ONLY IN 3D IMAX !!",10,6,14,10 December 2004
Mulholland Drive," Lonely madness in Hollywood.
","A beautiful pair of femme fatales find and lose each other and so do we. There's a mystery story you can piece together within the madness of one of the women.  I suppose you could figure it out eventually if you wanted to pursue it.  Nevertheless, the unexplained mix of fantasy and reality provides a satisfying experience.  What is clear is the story that Hollywood is about power and people.  Even talented people can get chewed up for good.",10,1,2,31 October 2001
Am√©lie," Joyous! The best of things feature film has to offer.
","I saw by myself on Wednesday and took my wife on Friday.  As the credits rolled she said she wanted to stay and see it again.  Wonderfully shot, acted, written, edited.  On par with 'It's a Wonderful Life.'  A celebration of existence.",10,1,3,30 November 2001
Munich," A Balanced View from a Human Perspective
","Very fine piece. I read from several semi-trusted sources that it glorified the Israeli position over the Palestinian. Wrong. It was a balanced, personal perspective that was, at heart, anti-war. I think, any viewer would feel compassion for the Palestinian's also from this piece. However, I can see how Palestinans would not be satisfied, but trust me, the point was made several times, very explicitly, that they both share the same story. Displaced. No home. Brutal tactics. Fight or die.I spent a month in Israel in '73. I was 19 and sleeping on the beaches at Eilat on the Red Sea. Golda Mier came to town and they used fire hoses to get us off the beach but it was all good natured. So we built hippie shanties out of cardboard in hills. I slept in city parks all around Israel and the occupied territories. Stayed in several kibbutz settlements where goats like to eat passports. I hiked alone and camped in the mountains above the Dead Sea. Played chess in open-air, dive bars drinking beer till the wee hours. I went there to see what it was like to have your back against the wall and see what war cost you, does for you and to you. It was like going back in time to our own American Revolutionary War. I was not disappointed. That's what 'Munich' accomplishes. War is not tidy.I took a ship from Haifa to Cyprus. You couldn't go directly from Israel to an Arab country, so Cyprus was the stepping stone. Israel doesn't stamp the passport directly, but gave me a sheet to hold their passport stamp. That way you can toss it and get into the Arab countries. The night I got to Cyprus 30 bombs went off in the capital. It was unstable, but more from the Greeks and Turks who both claim Cyprus. I got the next ship out to Beirut.Beirut was beautiful in '73. This was a few years before Lebanon started to melt down, but I was in the city right around the time of the para-military raid they depicted in the movie. I spent a few weeks in the Beka Valley near Syria exploring the Roman ruins. The hash oil trade was the main line of business in village where I stayed, but I declined to buy into it no matter how attractive and safe the dealers made it appear. When I saw 'Midnight Express' five years later in 1978 it made my butt pucker. I took the same path as the main character over land through Syria and Turkey to Europe. Syria was full of Soviet goods like the very heavy, clunky cameras that, nevertheless, worked pretty well. Turkey was full of 1956 Chevy's. I ate some bad sausage in Turkey and almost died for a few weeks. Beautiful land. My point is that being around there a few months gave me good feel for the very complicated, intractable situation and a love for all the people involved. Steven Spielberg does an honorable job with 'Munich.' Well, maybe the last speech by main character's mother was a bit much, but just a bit. The movie depicted what I saw in the eyes of a young Israeli women soldier in '73. It's the same look I saw in eyes of a young Arab man who played a game of chess with me and shared some beer.",10,1,1,25 January 2006
