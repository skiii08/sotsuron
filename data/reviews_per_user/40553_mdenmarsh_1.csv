Minority Report," Exhilarating Thrill Ride......
","Exhilarating Thrill Ride......To all those who have found plot holes and things that don't quite add up, couldn't figure it out etc............  STOP going to the movies stay home instead and watch docu-dramas and bad sit coms.This movie is a thrill ride that enchants with strange but believable characters with action scenes that don't suffer sterility (AKA star wars) because the director convinces the actors of their environment and they convince us.  AKA WE CARE!Fun film.... would recommend it to anyone that enjoys movies for movies sake and can escape their small suburban lives for a while.One of the terms they use in the film to describe the low life slums full of slugs and poverty is 'the sprawl'.  Next time u park ur oversize SUV at the local stripmall in ur suburban nightmare think of what that place will be like in 50 years.  Yep. it's the suburban SPRAWL.  Ur a part of it.Perhaps that's why some people just don't get this picture.M",10,0,0,26 December 2002
