The Blair Witch Project," Don't waste your time.
",I'm sorry but this is probably the only movie ever made which you can watch in Fast Forward and still understand what's going on. After the first half hour the entire movie is the same thing over and over again. I personally didn't get scared. I watched the movie on an empty stomach and the camera movement made me sick or perhaps I got sick because this was such a waste of time and money. What scares me about the movie is that it has actually generated millions.,1,2,4,21 December 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Excellent movie for the Star Wars Fan.
","This is a great movie if you are really into the Star Wars Saga, which I am. To truly appreciate this movie you should watch the first three and pay close attention to all the names(reading a few of the books wouldn't hurt either). But, if you like to see lots of special effects and really well done combat scenes, this is a must see.",9,0,0,23 May 1999
Mission: Impossible II," At least I understood it.
","I saw this movie thinking that they would learn from the mistakes in the past. In away they did. Instead of making a plot which requires about 5 viewings to understand what's going on, they made a plot which you can leave for about half the movie and still follow. I did enjoy the action sequences, although very unrealistic, but then again who goes to an action movie for realistic fights. This movie takes full advantage of the willing suspension of disbelief and requires you check logic and physics at the door while you watch too. I say, go watch this movie only if every other movie is sold out and you have nothing better to do than waste a few dollars.",2,0,0,24 May 2000
