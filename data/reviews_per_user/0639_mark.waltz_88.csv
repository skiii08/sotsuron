"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," A big gay Valentine that is certainly no drag.
","I can't believe it's the 25th anniversary of this Australian comedy classic, filled with music, joy, fear, love, longing and plenty of sparkles. It's timely still in many ways, yet not much has changed in certain ways either. Three completely different people get together for a long voyage through the Australian Wilderness, going from there safe gay community of Sydney into the outback to visit the ex-wife of one of the three female impersonators (one of whom is transgender), facing all sorts of adventures and dangers, some homophobic and a few surprising pleasant experiences along the way. Terence Stamp headlines the cast as the transgendered Bernadette, having recently lost her much younger boyfriend and desperate for a distraction from her grief. Joining her are Hugo Weaving as the sensible 'Mitzi' and Guy Pearce as the flamboyant 'Felicia', a drama queen who requires tons of attention and patience.Throw in the tough looking Bill Hunter as a tired, aging adventurer in a torturous marriage, rescuing them when the titled bus, Priscilla, breaks down and creating a unique bond with Bernadette. their goal is to get to the casino owned by mitzi's ex-girlfriend where they have been asked to perform their show, leading to a huge surprise in regards to Weaving's past. Their goal is to climb in complete drag up to the highest point in Australia, surrounded by lizards and kangaroo's and lots of eccentric characters.In addition to Hunter's very temperamental gold digging wife, there's a tough outback female whom Stamp strongly chastises for her homophobia, a macho country dude who can't tell that Pearce is a man in drag and reacts violently upon discovering the truth (also taken to task by Bernadette) and a little boy whose understanding of the gay lifestyle is way ahead of its time. In addition to some great costumes and music, there's great location photography of the Australian outback, and touching moments between the three performers that is a combination of sarcasm and tenderness that shows the truth about human relationships when tossed together in a challenging situation.Creating a Nostalgia for the music (and various other classic artists), this lead to the huge success of 'Muriel's Wedding', possibly influenced the creation of the big Broadway hit 'Mamma Mia!', and even a fairly successful Broadway version of this film. While all three leads are superb, it is Terence Stampwho steals every minute that he is on screen with his brusque personality that hides a huge heart. Pearce, a victim of some of Bernadette's best snipes, finds out about that heart in a tense situation. That however doesn't stop him from calling Bernadette with her birth name, a transgender no-no today. The mixture of the snark and the love that grows between the three turns this into a gay classic that will delight generations to come.",8,1,1,5 March 2019
Gremlins," What was originally filmed in the '80's should stay in the '80's.
","Please, Hollywood, leave the classics alone...those glorious old black and white films don't need to be remade 7 or 8 times like 'A Christmas Carol', and modern classics should be left alone as well. No sequels, prequels or remakes. If the recent 'Ghostbusters' remake is any indication, then this will be next (listed as 'in development'), and the frenzy will start all over again, with more sequels, stuffed animals, video games and other nonsense all to make greedy Hollywood big wigs richer, not for artistic integrity. I was seeing a lot of movies in the mid 1980's, and the year that this came out, Hollywood really transitioned the blockbuster into a new dimension. What began with 'Star Wars' and 'Superman' really exploded that year as the newest blockbusters in the theaters were these spectacular special effect dominated crowd pleasers that weren't obsessively overloaded with computer generated distractions from a decent story.While Zach Galligan is obviously a young man who should be out on his own, he's a family devoted adult whose unsuccessful inventor father (a very funny Hoyt Axton) wants to get him the best present possible. Visiting New York's Chinatown isn't the best idea with what he brings home, because instead of buying a priceless antique at bargain prices, he comes home with Gizmo, an adorable Mogwai who shouldn't get wet, see bright light or be fed after midnight. The nasty little balls of fur which pop out of them will bring more than just figgy pudding to the small town where they love.This is a Christmas movie that can still be enjoyed anytime during the year, and is filled with the type of film magic that younger filmmakers of today seem determined to surpass...and destroy. There's a Miss Gulch like character, an old battleaxe played by Polly Holliday, who would certainly be murdered had the gremlins not got her first. There's Galligan's boss (Edward Andrews in his last film) who kisses up to her, and Galligan's devoted girlfriend (Phoebe Cates) who stands by him. There's also a fantastic musical score you won't soon forget. But most of all, there is sweet little Gizmo, so loving and smart, and the wretched offspring that pop out from the strangest places. Axton's delightful inventor/father is quite likable, sort of a modern day version of Dick Van Dyke's eccentric inventor/father in 'Chitty Chitty Bang Bang'. The biggest surprise of all? A sequel that was actually better than the original! So when/if 'Gremlins 3' does come out, don't count me as part of its box office intake, because it will be a pale imitation of the first two, only minus the creativity.",6,1,2,6 September 2016
The Sound of Music," Rich and gooey, Sticky and sugary sweet, but unavoidable.
","I come here to review 'The Sound of Music', not to praise it. Yes, like the billions of other fans, I have seen this so many times I pretty much know it by heart. Like 'The Wizard of Oz', I have seen it both on television and the big screen, and have decided that for at least the next 10 years, I am leaving it alone. Still, one cannot forget about it, no matter how hard one tries. With sing-along showings of it at the Hollywood Bowl, constant dredging up at piano bars and the many spoofs it has received, 'The Sound of Music' has not died in my heart, just become momentarily dormant.I actually prefer the stage version (a 1995 revival) to the movie, as it was not overloaded with helicopter covered shots of the Alps or constant liederhosen clad kids, and basically stuck to the flour of the story rather than the frosting. Yet, there is something unshakable of Julie Andrews in her second big 'Nanny' film as Maria Rainer Von Trapp, the former postulate who ends up marrying her employer and helps him escape from the Nazis.In the first dozen times I saw this, I of course was overwhelmed by the helicopter shot of the Alps that eventually closes in on Julie twirling around the mountainside. What I did miss was the opening verse of the title song, sung so simply by Mary Martin in the 1959 original and Rebecca Luker decades later. The opening is equivalent to that of director Robert Wise's other big movie musical, 'West Side Story', even if the locations and mood are as far from each other as they can get. When the nuns sing of their issues with Maria (which includes a future 'General Hospital' legend, Anna Lee, as well as movie musical dubber Marni Nixon), I am in delight, because like those nuns, I too am conflicted by her. So how will she deal with the seven bratty children of Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) and his whistle blowing and his baroness fianc√©e (a cynical Eleanor Parker)? This sweet set-up, though, has serious overtones as World War II is blooming as much as the edelweiss, and after Maria and the Captain fall in love, the world changes from teaching the kids the notes to sing to finding a way to get out a country that while beautiful on the outside is in danger of becoming ugly on the inside. This changes the second half of the film (as it did the play) from a learning experience for all of these characters to a survival lesson where they must struggle to 'Climb Every Mountain'.Somewhat overproduced and certainly extremely long, it is still a crowd- pleaser that I can't recommend highly enough. Yes, my rating is not a '10', but that's from possibly too many viewings, sometimes too soon. Everybody shines in the film, although in a few particular moments, Plummer's phrasing and delivery of his dialog seems a bit awkward. It's nice to see Richard Haydn playing a character not as annoying as those he did in 'The Late George Apley' and 'Sitting Pretty'; He's obviously an opportunist and not afraid to admit it, yet in a few spots, shows definite heroism. Parker gets some great bitchy lines to deliver and adds some needed salt into the sugary proceedings.The heart and soul of the film, though, is Peggy Wood's Mother Superior, the equivalent in Rodgers and Hammerstein's cavalcade to 'Oklahoma's' Aunt Eller, 'Carousel's' Nettie, 'South Pacific's' Bloody Mary and 'The King and I's' Madame Thiang. She's not without some imperfections, and when she barrels out her line, 'Are you in love with him?', it seems as if she's looking for a good piece of gossip. But when Anna Lee and Portia Nelson (later 'All My Children's' long-time baby sitter Mrs. Gurney) admit they have sinned, her reaction is priceless and a proper send-off. 'Family Guy' crudely spoofed this scene years later.As for Julie Andrews, how can you not like her? She didn't get to repeat her Broadway roles at all, but fortunately 20th Century Fox got her for this, and I must say, her Maria is certainly more appealing as a Nanny than her Mary Poppins. It's obvious that she loves these children, is humble and far from the other worldly creature of the role for which she had just won an Oscar.",7,1,9,21 October 2013
50 First Dates," A practically perfect comedy with a delightful screen team.
","I can't think of any romantic comedy team of the past 20 years (other than Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan) who perfectly fit each other like Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore. They totally charmed me in 'The Wedding Singer', so to see them together again in this totally sweet comedy was a treat. This is a film that other than a few sad sequences had me smiling the entire time in addition to laughing. Other than the opening (which seemed out of place, having a dozen or so women talking about their first and last date with Sandler) and a few gag sequences straight out of early Sandler films, this is a complete charmer, filled with romance and humanity, and perhaps, Sandler's most lovable character. As much as I like his early work ('Billy Madison', 'Happy Gilmore', and reluctantly 'Little Nicky'), those films were filled with an anger missing from this and 'The Wedding Singer'. Together, Sandler and Barrymore are a perfect match, and I hope they do more films together.The basic storyline has Sandler meeting Barrymore in a Hawaiian restaurant, and not realizing she is brain damaged following a car accident, pursues her romantically. He has no idea that her short-term memory only lasts one day, and like an etch-a-sketch, erases once she goes to sleep. Rather than desert her, however, Sandler decides that he loves her enough to give up his own dreams just to be with her. He wins the trust of her eccentric father and her lisping, steroid taking brother, who once they realize he is sincere, allow him to court her anew on a daily basis. This leads to a situation that creates many entertaining moments and leads to a potential of sadness that it takes a magnificent writer to end in a satisfying conclusion.As usual, there are the typically eccentric supporting characters, familiar to those who know Sandler's work. From the funny (if a bit creepy looking) Hawaiian pothead (and his group of likable kids) to Sandler's androgynous Russian co-worker, as well as the staff of the Hawaiian restaurant, there's a lot of amusing bits with these delightful wackos. Even an amusing gross-out bit with a very funny walrus at the beginning doesn't come off as disgusting since its done so sweetly. If more recent Hollywood comedies could be like this, all would be right in the world of cinema. I can't think of another recent romantic comedy that is written with such love. This is what Hollywood magic is all about.",9,1,1,24 May 2011
Ghost," So much power in the truest emotion of eternal love.
","You have to be pretty darn cynical to dislike this spiritual romantic drama that shows you don't have to expose breasts or buttocks to have a box-office winner that today remains a modern classic. It is a story of good vs. evil, a story of redemption and a story of what can bring about the damnation of the soul. The story focuses on two attractive young adults (Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore), so obviously in love, that even sudden tragedy can't end. Moore, at her softest and loveliest, is an aspiring sculptor, and Swayze is her Wall Street broker fianc√©e. Their closest friend (Tony Goldwyn) is supposedly their biggest supporter, but the fates prove otherwise. When Swayze is shot and killed in a botched robbery, he is immediately separated from the physical but remains on earth as part of a mission to protect Moore from on-going evils. Swayze locates a fake spiritualist (Whoopie Goldberg) whom he quickly realizes can hear everything he says and haunts her until she promises to help him warn the woman he loves.'You in danger, girl', the Oscar Winning Goldberg tells her, and the skeptical Moore must fight reality and her need for communication from Swayze in order to go on with her life. The truth comes out quickly for the eternally awake Swayze who learns quickly the facts about being a ghost, first from a kindly old man whose spirit roams a hospital, and then from the angry ghost who fell off a train. The trains here are as much a character as Swayze, Moore and Goldberg are, tooting their horns as if a warning of evil premonitions. The J train/Myrtle Avenue stop is the location for where Swayze locates both his killer and Goldberg, and you can see him at various other New York City stops, learning the powers of being among the walking dead and jumping from moving train to moving train in order to locate the seemingly sinister ghost who initially screamed at him to 'Get off my train!'.Then, there's Tony Goldwyn, playing one of the great villains of movie history, showing that a lifetime of loyalty only can go so far in surviving the Wall Street game. Rick Aviles is his sinister partner in crime, a character so vile that you can't wait for him to get his come- uppance. That comes so suddenly and horrifically that the sensitive spiritual best be warned. It opens a lot of room for talk about what is beyond our control outside of the world we see around us and what makes for righteous and what makes for ruthlessness and selfishly motivated ambition. Aviles was a versatile actor who could play more than just a New York street thug, showing great sensitivity as a homeless man who shows kindness to Danny Glover and Matt Dillon in the underrated 'The Saint of Fort Washington'. As for Goldberg, she brings both a sense of her brilliant comic timing and subtle poignancy to the role of Ota Mae Brown, fake spiritualist who shows that underneath the facade of a life-long con-woman is a true beautiful human being. To watch her go from phony to fantastic is the stuff that retribution is made out of. Veteran character actor Phil Leeds is memorable as the first ghost Swayze encounters, while Vincent Schiavelli proves to be downright touching as the subway ghost, first frightening, then sadly vulnerable, an extraordinary cameo you won't forget.Swayze shows that a Wall Street broker doesn't have to be a ruthless cheat or a non-feeling corporate S.O.B., yet he isn't perfect either, as evidenced in the somewhat sick scene with Goldwyn on the elevator where they play a prank on the stone- faced passengers that is delicious payback for those of us who have dealt with corporate coldness and the evils of office politics. Moore is a total winner here, absolutely gorgeous, and the epitome of what a true lady is. Her sadness over loosing the love of her life never makes you feel sorry for her, but you empathize with her. Jerry Zucker, the man behind 'Airplane!' and 'The Naked Gun' movies, proves to be a brilliant dramatic storyteller, even if he comically spoofed the famous 'Unchained Melody' sequence in the first 'Naked Gun'. This is a story that everybody can find relatable, especially if you've gone through a tragic, sudden loss and need to find comfort in something more earthly than what any earthly being can tell you. The simple message is that grieving never completely goes away, but it gets better whenever the griever is ready for it to get better, in their own way and time.",9,0,1,27 March 2014
Raiders of the Lost Ark," 'Indiana (Mr. Jones), Chased by Nazi's, Crushed by old dead bones....'
","With all the Broadway versions of spectacles coming out now, I was just wondering how a musical version of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' would go over, music by John Williams (possibly based upon all his involvements with Spielberg) and lyrics, of course, by me... With that said, there is a tongue-in-cheek quality about 'Raiders' and its follow-ups which has caught my intention and probably many others familiar with the great movie serials of the 1930's and 40's. 'Raiders', of course, was influenced by that (and possibly some of Universal's old Maria Montez/Sabu movies), and in the summer of 1981, this is the movie that every teenager in America had to see and older audiences went to see with great nostalgia in their hearts because of the memories it brought back for them.Harrison Ford IS Indiana Jones, and nobody else could have done this part quite so well. He takes the role seriously, even though there is a glint of smugness in his eyes that he knows the role he's playing will give him screen immortality. Of course, there are four sides of Indiana-the college professor longing for life outside the classroom, the adventurer who is willing to go anywhere as long as he doesn't run into snakes, the romancer who always seems to end up with the wrong woman, and as we learned in 'The Last Crusade', the son of Sean Connery who always longed for something greater with his father and finally got it.This first edition rightly got a ton of Oscar Nominations, including Best Picture, and made a ton of money. Being one of the few Best Picture nominees to actually be a blockbuster, 'Raiders' takes its viewers on a ride from which they will want to return again and again. The Lost Ark is, of course, the Ark of the Covenant, and therefore, the film has a ton of religious references. Nasty Nazi's (lead by urbane Paul Freeman) are after it, believing it will give Hitler (and thus the Nazi party) divine power. But Indiana, learning the hard way about Nazi evils, is determined to stop them at any cost, even if it means being trapped in tombs with cobras, asps, rattlers and all sorts of poisonous vipers. Oh, did I mention that there were snakes there, too? His lady friend here is Karen Allen, a tough cookie whose first scene has her punching him out. She's a raspy voiced broad who has seen a thing or two in life and lived to tell about it. She's the type who lives up to 'What doesn't kill you makes you stronger', and thus, she's a good match for Ford's Indiana. What happened after the plot line was concluded here and the fourth entry (25 years later) was left up to the viewer's imagination. No other woman in between those two films could compare with her.In addition to Freeman as the Nazi is the very creepy looking Ronald Lacey who is obviously based upon 30's and 40's characters played by Peter Lorre, and his presence is unforgettable. Such memorable character actors as John Rhys Davies and Denholm Elliott add to the fun of the film, with a young Alfred Molina in a smaller role. Even though he doesn't appear in the film, Spielberg's presence is felt throughout, and when you mention this and some of his other films, you think of him before you think of any of the actors. The special effects are outstanding and the score is so magnificent that it sounds even great in symphonies, such as the one I saw years ago at the Hollywood Bowl conducted by Mr. John Williams himself.",10,2,5,29 August 2014
Spartacus," An epic of the evils of slavery in any era, any location, any culture....
","The ancient Romans prided themselves on their democracy, provided that you were a free man, and that you fell within a certain social structure. So in over 2000 years, times haven't really changed, only the names of what 'slaves' are referred to as now are. Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece is a document of slaves saved from certain death for uncertain death by becoming gladiators, the ancient version of today's prize-fighters. Spartacus (Kirk Dougla) is discovered enslaved on the rock pile and is bought by upperclass Peter Ustinov and made a gladiator. His training is rough and dangerous. Seen jumping to avoid being hit on the legs by a rotating wooden plank, he then has to duck to avoid being hit in the head. The wheel turns faster, the planks are removed, and sword-like objects are revealed. The next thing you know, he is in the ring, afraid of ending up fighting one of his new found pals. But when one gladiator refuses to execute him as ordered, he is killed by the vicious Roman nobleman (Laurence Olivier) and Spartacus escapes to gather the gladiators together to form an army against these practices. Meanwhile, Olivier reveals an attraction to one of his slaves (Tony Curtis) who escapes and joins forces with Douglas, now married to Olivier's former house servant (the lovely Jean Simmons). The gladiator's army increases in size, and prepares to leave Rome, but Rome won't leave well enough alone as Olivier teams with Julius Caesar (John Gavin) to bring the gladiators to their knees.Brutally filmed to show the inhumane treatment of these strong men living as 'slaves of entertainment for the bored rich', their exploitation at the hands of the upper class isn't made to look pretty or glamorous. They rebel as they realize that they are going to die anyway, so they might as well die with their integrity intact. Then, there are the noblemen who find their places in society diminishing because of decreasing resources who end up protecting those they used to exploit themselves. Along with Ustinov, that group includes the legendary Charles Laughton (who years earlier played Roman emperor Nero) in one of his last films. Watching the wealthy Roman women get into watching gladiators being basically torn apart reminded me of the evil Livia (Sian Phillips) in the BBC mini-series 'I, Claudius', and her scene with gladiators almost a hundred years after this took place demanding real blood, a good show, with plenty of coin for the living and a decent burial for the dead. Nina Foch and Joanna Barnes are Olivier's wife and daughter who act like the female fans of prize-fighting films of the 40's, screaming and drooling over the scantily clad gladiators (leaving little to the imagination) in a lustful manner, much like Myrna Loy in 'The Mask of Fu Manchu'.Even at over three hours long, 'Spartacus' is never boring, and has some truly amazing battle scenes and a final confrontation between Douglas, Curtis and Olivier that is ultra-chilling. Jean Simmons, even playing a basically supporting role, has a lot to do as Douglas's devoted spouse who must stand up to Olivier after the battle between the gladiators and Roman army. The final scene is a heartbreaker and is one you will remember long after the film is over.",10,0,0,10 January 2013
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," A real 'Breeze!' to watch over and over!
","This is for the kid in all of us, those who grew up with cartoons as part of our movie going in the 1930's, 40's and 50's, and in my case, grew up watching the Saturday morning line-up that automatically featured two hours of 'The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner' show. It will take more than one viewing to catch all of the famous cartoon characters who appear in this film, mostly ones from the early sound era (in the public domain most likely) and those from Warner Brothers and Disney. This is a mixture of animation and film noir, with the human characters and cartoon characters mixing together as if they were part of the same world, although the presence of an area of the Hollywood Hills known as 'Toon Town' makes the cartoon character's world seem 'segregated'. The film stars Bob Hoskins as a cynical private detective down to the last threads of an agency, desperate for a case, practically any case, but not one preferably concerning 'toons', as his brother was killed by a 'toon', which has stereotyped most toons in his book (with the exception of Betty Boop perhaps) as bad.The film opens with a hysterical spoof of the Warner Brothers cartoons with Roger Rabbit the baby sitter for a cookie craving toddler who endangers Roger's life simply by crawling out of his high chair while Roger isn't looking. After this, we learn the truth about 'toon actors' (he's a 50 year old toon with a 3 month old 'dinkie', the actor playing the baby garbles), and then get to meet Roger's wife, Jessica, an animated film noir vixen who sings like Amy Irving but talks like Kathleen Turner. Is Jessica a murderous femme fatale who killed off toon town owner Stubby Kaye? Or is she an innocent patty caker who is just content to stay at home and make Roger a carrot cake? As we learn from Betty Boop, work has been hard for some toons ever since cartoons went to color, and the fact that Jessica is the lucky one because Roger Rabbit is a huge star. The dueling Daffy and Donald Duck piano playing sequence proves that not all ducks come from the same pot and that not all of them cackle or squawk in a practically un-hearable manner.Then, there's the evil darkly dressed judge (Christopher Lloyd) who seems to somehow be a distant relative of Disney's evil queens, sorceresses and stepmothers, obsessed with destroying toon town because of his creation of some obscure traveling idea called 'a freeway'. 'Billboards as far as the eye can see!', Lloyd proclaims, and in order to get this through the valley, he needs to destroy toon town, and that means stopping anybody who can get ahold of Kaye's will. His crew of evil howling hyena henchmen will do anything for either a laugh or a quick buck, and as the audience learns, they literally have the ability to laugh themselves to death.Where there's a femme fatale in film noir, there's also the tired, big hearted waitress, and here, it's Hoskins' long suffering girlfriend, Joanna Cassidy. While Jessica is an animated Rita Hayworth style character, Cassidy is a modern day compilation of Joan Blondell, Ann Sheridan or Alice Faye who essayed that archetype throughout the 1930's and 40's. The details here are fabulous with references to many aspects of the entertainment world of the 1940's, even a reference to the invisible rabbit Harvey. The most popular animated rabbit of all time, Bugs Bunny, does appear, paired with the single most popular mouse in animation history, Mickey. To see these two legendary characters together is ingenious, right after Hoskins encounters a 'piggy picking' Tweety Bird. Of course, with energy lacking dog Droopy as the elevator pooch, Hoskins already has his hands full when he enters this toon town apartment building.This film created a huge buzz in 1988, having long runs in its premiere and filling up the massive Cinerama Dome on Sunset Blvd. for weeks. Several cartoon short sequels followed, but unfortunately, there was never a sequel, with director Robert Zemickis realizing perhaps there was no way he could top this, so why try? Thirty years after its premiere, it holds up as a classic in every way, with the mixture of animation and live action superb and the 1940's atmosphere brilliant. Even a haunting musical score by Alan Silvestri makes you feel like you've driven into a time tunnel. There are few films that are absolutely perfect, and this would certainly be in most people's top 10 listing of films that are. Whether you are a return viewer to this film for the umpeenth time (and get teary-eyed over the nostalgia that it brings back) or a first time young viewer out to find out why this is so brilliant, it is guaranteed to bring on a smile, many a laugh, and certainly for first time viewers, become a film you will want to revisit again and again...and again.",10,4,5,23 November 2018
Finding Neverland," A trip to a wonderful place where even the adults can never grow old.
","Johnny Depp went from playing a pirate to playing a writer who wrote about pirates, and ironically, he ends up playing against Dustin Hoffman who once played the pirate in the story his story wrote about. Depp is James M. Barrie, the British playwright who introduced the world to Peter Pan. He's married to a very beautiful but distant woman, and along the way, cures his off stage unhappiness by befriending beautiful widow Kate Winslet and her four boys. Becoming their 'uncle', Depp takes them onto a magical journey to a wonderful land where boys never grow up and adventure awaits around every culture.This is indeed a magical movie, and it recently had a lengthy run as an equally magical musical. The movie features the legendary Julie Christie as Winslet's domineering mother, a woman of contradictions who certainly needs some magic of her own to lessen her inhibitions that are well meaning and understandable, not just some aging harridan who is unreasonably sour. It's a magical trip back in time too, giving a glimpse into a story re- told many times and reformatted in several different ways. Depp is fantastic in this, a film and musical I could watch or listen to over and over and never, never grow old from the magic it gives each time.",8,0,0,9 November 2016
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Since God gifted many of us with a sense of humor, would he laugh at this mockery of the biblical epic?
","Having already searched for the holy grail, the Monty Python took swipes at the big J.C. in this controversial farce that still offends today. But whether you are atheist, open minded Christian or Muslim or Jew, or just a fan of this style of comedy, you will always look on the bright side of laughs. As a film goer with a genuine belief in basic Christian principals, I choose to laugh and not take every slam at the story of the Crucifixion as a slam against the man whom I believe died for my sins, long before I committed them. As a teenager, I didn't quite get the droll humor of Monty Python, but upon reaching a certain age, I discovered the 'Meaning of Life', and another search for the holy grail lead me to Spamalot on Broadway, and after a long hiatus, a return to comical Calvary where the zealots of organized religion take a slam, where it is up to the viewer to decide the writer's and actor's motives for taking potshots at the most holy of sacrifices ever made. To the writer's credit, they chose not to focus directly on Jesus, and created typical Python onlookers to historical events.Like Mel Brooks and his only history of the world, the Python gang strives to get the period detail right. The only detail is in the style of comedy, and while it often feels like there should be a laugh-track, a sense of awe takes over, especially with a very Bond like opening theme sung by Shirley Bassey sound-a- like Sonia Jones. The British accents of the cast properly spoofs all of those epics of the 1950's and 60's where it pretty much seemed that all you had to be was trained in the British theater to be cast in a biblical epic.Of course, Monty Python cult followers can quote every line, and I feel if the Christians who protested this were to watch this, they'd see that it is the religious epic genre that's being spoofed, not Jesus being ridiculed. It just makes me wish for a similar film spoofing 'The Ten Commandments', a classic epic that takes a lot of ribbing in the first place. Granted, some of the humor is crude, but to paraphrase the popular theme song, 'Life's a piece of (enter brown word) when you look at it', so sometimes a bit of crudeness can appropriately describe a situation like this that no other way could.",6,0,2,7 September 2017
Shakespeare in Love," Where there's a a Will, there's a play.
","While this deals with the creation of 'Romeo and Juliet', in some eyes his very best play, this is really a story of deception, a la Yentl, a la 'As You Like It'. This is about the desires of a young lady (Gwyneth Paltrow) who desired to act and disguised herself as a boy to play the part of Romeo, ironically opposite a young male actor as Juliet. In the process, she falls in love with Shakespeare (the dashing Joseph Fiennes) and while he returns her feelings, he uses elements of their relationship to finish the play. A jealous suitor becomes Mercutio; her nurse (Imelda Staunton) becomes Juliet's nurse, and various personal tragedies guide the conclusion, leading to a triumph....or does it?Perfect in every detail, this Oscar winning best picture features a great cast in smaller parts, most notably the Oscar winning Judi Dench as the imperious Queen Elizabeth II, basically a cameo, but a commanding one. There's some ironic cameos as well, including 'Downton Abbey's' Carson (Jim Carter) as the actor playing the nurse, and deep down the cast list, 'Are You Being Served?''s Mr. Humphreys (John Inman). Geoffrey rush, Simon Callow and Ben Affleck are just a sample of the incredible cast. There's humor, tension, sexism galore (a historical fact of the times) and lush music, photography and art direction. I'm glad this just presents the facts (fictional or not) and leaves the point of view to the audience decide.",10,1,1,9 March 2017
Stripes," The military is not something to make fun of. It can do that perfectly fine on its own without really trying.
","It's nice to see some of the casts of Saturday Night Live and SCTV come together on film. Here, Bill Murray meets John Candy, and it's absolute hilarity at the expense of the army, obviously made on the basis of the success of 'Private Benjamin', but changing genders as it heads back into comic territory that has tickled audiences going back way before Abbott and Costello turned the military upside down in 'Buck Privates'. Here, Murray and old pal Harold Ramos enter the military and fond themselves getting away with all sorts of pranks, with Candy and Judge Reinhold among the others they encounter in an attempt at becoming soldiers that seems to be a major implausibility. This farce isn't reflective of army life in any way, shape or form, just a scathing commentary on the silliness of the seriousness of it all. Arrogant non-commissioned officers, serious privates and imperious officers are given scathing portrayals, showing the real life NCO's, privates and commissioned officers how ridiculous they look with that scowling look and stuck up attitude that under some circumstances leads to rebellion. A young John Laroquette spoofs that image as the new captain on the training base who has secrets that isn't becoming of an officer.Emulating Sergeant Carter from 'Gomer Pyle U.S.M.D.', Warren Oates plays the typical screaming and sneering drill sergeant who meets his match in the sassy Murray. P.J. Soles and Sean Young play two female m.p.'s who are lacking in discipline every time they encounter Murray and Ramis, especially when Murray gets frisky with an ice cream scoop. Forget about any sense of reality with their characters, thrown in along with some innocent T&A for sexy thrills. Having already explored slobs vs. the preppy's and slobs vs. the snobs, this is the slobs vs. humorless authority, making along with 'Animal House' and 'Caddyshack' a trio of slob comedies that started a new genre of comedy and one that is still ripped off today.",6,2,5,11 May 2017
12 Angry Men," One of the great theatrical examples of what makes for superb drama.
","Theater at its best is practically impossible to get down on film correctly. When Hollywood gets it right, they create a work of art. In this case, they did it simply, without frills, casting actors who looked real and fell into their individual parts like kids into a swimming pool on a hot summers day. It's the hottest day of the year, and these twelve men must decide the fate of an accused killer. But twelve men means twelve personalities, twelve temperaments, twelve political views, twelve religious opinions and twelve preconceived notions. As the temperature swells, so does the temperament. Having been a very reluctant jury foreman, I find myself seeing eye to eye with the shyness of the man forced to lead the proceedings. Everybody looks at you to get the ball rolling and hopefully get out of there as quickly as possible. Martin Balsam, as the foreman, tries to remain dignified and not be overly in control, losing that to one of the jurors who looks at the case in a completely different way than the others. Twelve personalities means plenty of neuroses, and in a very short time, seeing what's really going on in the minds of strangers whom you'll never see again.This trial involves young John Sacova, accused of killing his own father, and the twelve men must decide whether he gets the chair or not. These men, only identified through their juror number, are completely different, and it's obvious from the start that some of them (John Fiedler in particular) vote guilty because they think they have to. Only one (Henry Fonda) votes not guilty, and of course, one of them says, 'There's always one.' There are the aggressive ones certain of guilt, empathetic ones who would like to see the charges reduced, and those who view all young people from certain areas as scum regardless of their situation. At 60 years old, this film shows the same prejudices we face today, yet shows that there is always someone not about to follow the crowd simply because something strikes them as off. It is Fonda who will pretty much control the room, although he does it in a subtle way where nobody realizes that he's pretty much taken over.While jury's have changed in 60 years (allowing women to serve being the most obvious change), what hasn't changed in the conflict of trying to understand the truth and to agree with 11 other people about it. Fonda goes against what would be allowed today by acting on his own and visiting the neighborhood of the crime, but his passion in figuring out the truth is very admirable. He is quiet in his determination, making this typical Fonda but one that fills his soul with humility and integrity.Under the direction of novice Sidney Lumet, the entire cast is outstanding. Familiar faces from all walks of show business each get their chance to shine. Jack Klugman, Ed Begley, E.G. Marshall, Jack Warden, to name a few. I could easily write something about each of them, but it's worth checking them all out yourself. The one juror who really makes an impression in creating his character is Lee J. Cobb as the very aggressive juror who is hiding behind similarities to the case, having had a contentious relationship with his son that sparks his instant sense that the defendant is guilty beyond a shadow of a doubt. He was deservedly nominated for a Golden Globe (as was Fonda), but the Oscars only acknowledged the film, director and script for nominations. Each jury is its own story, and from city to city, nothing changes but the type of case and the date.",10,2,3,20 March 2017
That Thing You Do!," You've heard of the 'Jersey Boys', Well, here come the 'Erie Boys!'
","Yay! Somebody made a movie set in my home town! Historically made famous by early American battles in the infancy of our country, Erie PA is also famous for where a certain overweight US President got stuck in a bathtub, and where a comic named Bob Hope wed his lovely bride, Delores. But for Tom Hanks (here the filmmaker in addition to actor), he uses Erie as the setting for a boy's band which suddenly rises to fame and go through all of the stereotypical star-making egos where many lessons are learned.Fans of 60's rock music will love this for its accurate description of the times, through the music, fashions, beehive hairdo's and those crazy home decors usually found in the old Green Stamps catalogs. Erie residents may not recognize State Street in the few street scenes (with the exception of the still standing facade of the old Boston Store), but mentions of Mercyhurst College and radio/TV station WJET (their ABC affiliate-Channel 24 during my youth), plus constant reminders as the boys go on the road that they are Erie natives, the film becomes a hallmark card to a beautiful city that sometimes takes a ribbing but in truth is actually one of the top tourist attractions in Pennsylvania.Hanks gives an enthusiastic performance as the manager of the band who is determined to rise them to fame. If Detroit can have their Dreamgirls, then Erie is more than allowed to have their Laker Boys! While the real 1960's produced a lot of schlocky rock & roll movies (mainly through some Sam Katzman produced musicals made at Columbia studios or those silly American International Frankie/Annette 'Beach Party' movies), this is a loving salute to all the glitz from the movies and television shows of this era, with a bit of 'Bye Bye Birdie' and 'Hairspray' thrown in. As for the energetic title song, I really was shocked to learn that it was written for the movie, not an actual hit from that era.",6,0,2,2 November 2012
The Mummy," Everybody loved their mummy!
","Practically every classic film utilizing a theme of ancient Egypt or the invasion of their fabulous temples has been lovingly ripped off and spoofed in this completely delightful sword and sandals adventure. Starting off much like the 1932 Karloff horror film and its Hammer remake, it takes on a non-stop ride into comedy and adventure as the scenario moves from the ancient setting flashbacks to the 1920's. Old Maria Montez camp favorites are joined together with the many comedy spoofs of the genre, whether it be Wheeler and Woolsey's 'Mummy's Boys' or 'Abbot and Costello Meet the Mummy'. There's even a bit of 'Land of the Pharaohs' as the giant tomb closes up just as it had for Joan Collins in that 1955 camp classic.You will be happy to know that this is completely family friendly with little to give nightmares even though there are some insinuations of horrific things taking place off camera. Perhaps the only thing that might give some viewers the heeby- jeeby's are the flesh eating bugs, but nothing is shown, only implied. Universal remade several of their classic horror films, and while this isn't the modern classic of 'Bram Stoker's Dracula', it makes up for the over-done 'Mary Shelley's Frankenstein'.The always refreshing Brendan Fraser may be a poor man's Indiana Jones to some, but he is a charming and irresistible rogue who is rescued from hanging by Egyptologist Rachel Weisz , agreeing to escort her to the valley of the kings where she intends to find the valuable treasures dating back to the reign of Pharaoh Seti I. Unbeknownst to them, the mummy awaits, cursed to the worst fate after murdering the Pharaoh after seducing his wife. The torment that he faces is nothing compared to what the invaders of his tomb will endure.This moves by at a speedy pace thanks to the often Three Stooges style comedy. Mixing old style Saturday matin√©e fun with modern technology works wonders to keep this afloat, and it is a film lover's dream for good old fashioned thrills mixed with updated styles. Nothing to really criticize here even with a few clich√©s here and there. Some of the highlights include a chase between a giant moving walk of sand (complete with mummy face) and the small aircraft piloted by veteran character actor Bernard Fox, and the march of Pharaoh's mummy guards who only seem to be missing the 'March of the Winkies' theme from 'The Wizard of Oz'. This is one of the rare occasions where I look forward to the sequel, if not the remake due in 2017.",7,1,2,28 May 2016
The Natural," Who gets the bill for the broken clock?
","In the most famous scene from this modern baseball classic, struggling middle aged professional baseball player Robert Redford strikes gold after a spell of strike outs. It's thanks to the presence of a majestic lady in white (Glenn Close) who stands up to guide him to his big hit. Redford, as comeback king Roy Hobbs is a mystery man who all who knows him, and even though they haven't seen each other in years, it is Close who knows him best. Wouldn't you be a bit of a mystery man if all of a sudden, you were shot for some unknown reason by a mysterious dark haired vixen who claimed that they were fascinated by your talents? Barbara Hershey is briefly seen as this mysterious femme fatale, and after that, it is surprising that he could ever trust a woman again. Along the way he meets another vixen, Kim Basinger, who distracts him into loosing, and the question becomes, 'Why?'Not just a film for baseball fans, this is a look at every young boy's American dream. Whether it be baseball player, fireman or even president of the United States, it is a look at how good intentions come out of the Innocence of childhood, and how dishonest people can step in the way of one's dreams. Certainly one of the great modern baseball classics, it is even better then the mystical 'Field of Dreams' which had little to do with professional baseball other than solving an issue for the film's hero, Kevin Costner. If Costner was the All- American hero of the 1990's, Robert Redford dominated much of the sixties, seventies and eighties with his easygoing personality, way with the ladies and his determination to make films that were artistic as well as entertaining.The cast is excellent, although I've never been quite convinced that Kim Basinger was one of the great beauties of the last 30 years in films. Glenn Close, on the other hand, had a realistic beauty that shines in the scene where she stands up in the Chicago baseball stadium. Some movie fans ridicule her as being somewhat haggard, but I've never looked at her that way. If you don't find the fact that she is indeed beautiful, watch this film and think again. I would rather have the girl next door that look like Glenn Close rather than a buxom vixen like Basinger who uses sex to sell.As Redford's mentors on the baseball team, the fictional New York Knights, Wilford Brimley and Richard Farnsworth are particularly outstanding. Brimley is that grouchy old grandfather we all know and love, knowing that underneath that gruffness is a huge heart of gold. Farnsworth is more quiet, and the wisdom that he silently conveyed to the complaining Brimley is something that you can take to heart. Less honorable are the characters played by Robert Duvall and Robert Brodsky, the later cast as an amoral judge who instantly wants to see Redford suppressed as a baseball superstar.While not an obsessive baseball fan, I can still appreciate the fascination with the sport, having grown up with professional games going to the Pittsburgh Pirates when they were at Three Rivers Stadium. I remember as a child the way I felt being in the presence of the All American Heroes and when I saw the film in its original release, those memories came back to me along with the excited looks of the two youngsters who popped in and out, looking up to Redford as their own hero. This does take a realistic look at the rivalry between players on the same team, some jealous or envious of Redford, referring to him as that old man since they obviously don't have the power he has. I wish I had a baseball bat like wonder boy when I was a kid. Of all the professional sports, baseball remains the most all American, and it is films like this that celebrate that sport's greatest qualities.",9,0,1,11 May 2016
Ed Wood," Ed and Bela, pulling the strings!
","There's something adorable about the pathetic character of Edward D. Wood Jr., at least here played by Johnny Depp at his height. From bio's I've read about him, he wasn't somebody you'd see outside a neighborhood pub, and from the dreck he produced late in his life, not somebody I'd sit down to interview. But the first decade of his career in Hollywood, as unglamorous as it was, gave him a legendary status that only a cult director like Tim Burton can understand. 'We don't have a license! Run!', he says while in drag, shooting a scene for 'Glen or Glenda'. That's the touching, almost childlike innocence of his character we see here, wide-eyed and sensitive, ambitious yet untalented, and at least three of his films (all those featuring Bela Lugosi) have ended up in a canon of the best of the bad movies. To say that this is a valentine to the worst director of all times is an understatement. It is a love letter to anybody who tried to break into the Hollywood mainstream and failed, giving a 'fantasia' to the best of his bad movies 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' with a supposed premiere at the Pantages (of all places) who wouldn't show an A list horror film from Universal let alone an independently produced film so bad that like the producer at Warner Brothers one would think was made as a joke. Painted hubcaps, sets that shake, and refrigerators as part of laboratory equipment are just among the bad props, all ending with 'a big explosion' and stock footage so unrelated to everything else going on that it has to be seen to be believed.There are two standout performances in this film: Johnny Depp as Wood himself and veteran actor Martin Landau who captures every essence of Bela Lugosi yet makes him somebody I'd still want to sit down with, even if he was smoking those cheap Hungarian cigars. Bela Lugosi may not have cursed or slammed Boris Karloff like he does here (according to his own son), but that only comes very briefly, and out of a sudden fit of temperament event the worst of actors can have if the ego strikes. I, too, prefer Lugosi over Karloff, and have everyone of his movies, and even in his Monogram films, there is something about him where you can't take your eyes off of him. Lugosi could be funny, as seen in dealing with the likes of Joe E. Brown, W.C. Fields, Burns and Allen and later Abbott and Costello (not to mention the Martin and Lewis knock-offs (Duke Mitchell, Sammy Petrillo), and Landau instills every level of Lugosi's personality. His winning of an Oscar was also a win for the long dead Lugosi who gained a new generation of admirers thanks to this film.Depp, with his wide eyed innocent smile, false teeth, slight speech impediment, fascination for angora and the mouthing of his own words as he watches his finished movie on the silver screen, is adorable, and in spite of the obviousness of his bad movies, you can't help but cheer him on, even if knowing he fails. Wood made more movies than the three shown here in production, but this could be almost a Hope and Crosby 'Road' movie as it focuses on the oddball pairing of a young wannabee and an elderly has-been who come to adore each other, rely on each other, and ultimately use each other for their desire to keep their dream going. The supporting cast is fine, almost parody like, with Sarah Jessica Parker's growing frustration over boyfriend Wood making her a volcanic eruption waiting to happen, Bill Murray's effeminate transgender wannabe both touching and heartbreaking, and Jeffrey Jones' Criswell a master in fraud. George 'The Animal' Steele is dead on as Tor Johnson, and Lisa Marie's Vampira perfection in cold creepiness. Juliet Landau, as the 'innocent young lady new in town' who funds 'Bride of the Monster' with $300 and lands the leading role is perfection in sly child-like manipulation, and Patricia Arquette touching as the young girl Ed meets while caring for a hospitalized Lugosi and ends up staying with him as his wife for the remainder of his life. When I first saw this in the movie theater, the Century City California audience seemed to be filled with those in the business who laughed hysterically from the time Jones opened his coffin to give the opening speech to the film credits that utilized plot developments and props from the three movies here (the octopus attacking the spaceship and getting 'the shock' of its life and the gravestones utilized as revealing the actors in the film), all throughout the lower Santa Monica Blvd. locations of Z grade movie studios, the theft of the giant octopus and Landau's hysterics as he fights with the unmoving rubber creature while drenched. The DVD includes some interesting bonus footage, most memorably scenes cut out, some of which I can understand why they didn't make it, and others that might have added some additional character development. References to the original 'Dracula' and Wood's obsession with Orson Welles (a meeting with him as depicted here apparently never happened), but that's the fantasia of life in Hollywood for some who do not make it: they have dreams of meeting their idols, and while Wood did meet Lugosi, it's obvious that meeting Welles would have been the shining star on his movie career that may not have been a shining one, but has kept his name on the minds of cult movie lovers of all ages.",7,1,3,26 January 2018
The Day After Tomorrow," This is a trip to the library they'll never forget.
","The New York Public library at 5th Avenue and 42nd Street never got such a floor mopping as it gets in this silly but sometimes exciting disaster movie that is at its weakest when dealing with the family situation of climate expert Dennis Quaid and doctor Sela Ward. He's too busy predicting climate changes to really be a husband to the compassionate Ward and a father to somewhat nerdy Jake Gyllenhaal. Jake happens to be in New York for a science seminar when the world's climate prepares to shift majorly.When the film's outrageous special effects take over, the movie is at its most compelling, but rather than just presenting these characters dealing with the disastrous situation, it takes them into a level of soap opera that fortunately most disaster movies of the 1970's only hinted at. Quaid prepares in the face of disaster to get from Washington D.C. to New York, ending up walking there from Philadelphia and desperately trying to hide from 'the eye of the storm' that would freeze him to death instantly. That freezing is shown happening to a helicopter pilot caught in the eye, and also shows some solitary scientists facing their last moments with dignity in the coldness of Scotland. The stranded people in the library in New York includes a disgruntled librarian (possibly based upon some of the real staff I've seen there) who doesn't believe in God but refuses to allow them to burn the Guttenberg bible, the oldest written document in the world. That bible has been on display at the library in a glass case, and makes an interesting metaphor for the spiritual emptiness of a world which had gone cold long before the poles started melting.Of course, New York isn't the only place affected by this disaster. Los Angeles is shown being ripped apart by a super tornado (a combination of three smaller ones), and the destruction of the city (particularly the erasing of the Hollywood sign) is just a preliminary to what the same director would do 8 years later with the even more outrageous '2012'. Like 'Titanic', the special effects gets at some point to be just way too much, but there are some moments of intensity that just can't be surpassed. At two hours, this isn't overly long, even though the whole 'family' message could have been shorted by at least 10-15 minutes. The more interesting characters are the minor ones, particularly the homeless black man with the dog, the atheist librarian, as well as Quaid's partner who makes a sacrifice to save him.Having experienced potential disaster in L.A. by living through the 1994 Northridge earthquake, I noticed that movie watchers at the video store I worked at became fascinated during this time by disaster movies, and as a result, films with earthquakes became much requested rental fair. A viewing of the film 'Volcano' at the Beverly Connection had the audience in cheers when the very building where I was got to be blown up. Fascination with disaster and seeing destruction of famous sites seems to be much more interesting to viewers going to these movies than the personal drama which took too much time to set up and lacked in the excitement of the rest of the movie. Still, this movie will always have a special place in my movie going memory with a huge billboard both in Times Square and the Sunset Strip where a frozen torch at the tip of the Statue of Liberty was seen barely coming out of the snowy base.",4,0,4,11 May 2015
A Bridge Too Far," Lots of great moments do not add up to a classic film.
","The 1960's and 70's were filled with all-star epics that dealt with particular incidents or battles or victories or losses during World War II, and only a handful of them have stood the test of time. There just isn't enough time even in 2 hours and 40 minutes to give each of these international stars a chance to create a memorable character let alone give a great performance. Every time you turn around, there's another Oscar winner, another romantic heartthrob, another action hero on screen, and in a few incidents, their appearances are met with laughter. Gene Hackman, for example, is supposed to be a Polish general, but why did he choose to speak with an Irish brogue?Ryan O'Neal and Robert Redford may have had all of the ladies hearts aflutter through 'Love Story' and 'The Way We Were', but they are completely wasted here. Sean Connery, Dirk Bogarde and Edward Fox are commanding in their larger roles as officers, and actually get some meatier material. Michael Caine is amusing, but basically playing Alfie in an officer's uniform. But this is a film about moments, not everything neatly wrapped up together, and this makes it a complete disappointment from the start. The presence of Elliot Gould gave wags another excuse to comment on his being in pretty much every film that came out in the 1970's. Liv Ullman is the only female among the cast of international stars.The film starts with a sweet narration of where the war was going in 1944, indicating that it was only a matter of time before the Germans were smashed, but it isn't quite over yet. There are more big battles, more challenges, and definately a lot more casualties. The small moments will stick in your mind more than the big battle scenes which we've seen over and over. One particular moment involves an innocent pre-teen Dutch boy, seen earlier with his parents in a joyful moment where they realize that, even as losers in the war, it will be over soon. He later rides his bike along a country road where he is stopped by a Nazi soldier, explains himself (in German), and is allowed to pass. There is obviously some big wig at the estate guarded by rifle pointing soldiers, and tanks line the highway where he passes as well. Without saying a word, he says much, and that makes the film briefly profound. Big memorable moments include a scene where hundreds of soldiers parachute out of British planes onto dutch soil which to a German soldier in 1944 probably looked like a plague of locusts storming in.The huge titles that keep telling the viewer where the setting has changed to becomes majorly distracting over a while, covering the upper part of the screen rather than more sensible small lettering on the bottom. The film surrounds efforts of the British to surround and maintain control over bridges in Germany near the Dutch border, a simple plot, but more complicated in accomplishing. The arriving British troops get a rousing, loving welcome by a bunch of inmates who have escaped from a mental institution, and later by the grateful residents of a border town near one of the bridges.It is obvious that every one of these films seemed to want to out-do the previous ones in the number of planes being shot down, tanks climbing over the rough terraine turned into a battlefield, and any type of noisy explosion. On a big screen, it looks fantastic, and also includes a profound musical score, but this is nothing really all that new. Director Richard Attenborough fortunately learned by the time of 'Ghandi' that epics work much better when focus is on character, not on action, and didn't overdo the number of star cameos that were not necessary. Once again, the German officers are allowed to speak in their native tongue with no subtitles needed, and their phony charm and aggression is obvious even then,",7,0,0,25 May 2020
Sleepy Hollow," You may find yourself laughing so hard that it will be hard to keep your head attached...
","O.K., any film director who can make you laugh at the sight of heads being chopped off (not to mention throats slit) is my kind of director. Tim Burton has been keeping me laughing ever since he had Pee Wee Herman ask where the basement in the Alamo was. Then, he had me sobbing (along with the Danny Elfman music) to Johnny Depp making ice sculptures in 'Edward Scissorhands', martians chatting unstop in 'Mars Attacks!' while dissolving people, and of course, the newly dead learning how to scare the living in 'Beetlejuice'. All of these films are now modern classics, and 'Sleepy Hollow' is up there because of the artistic way it has modernized Washington Irving's classic and the themes of vengeance and terror it combined to make a riveting view of hell on earth.From the moment you see Johnny Depp here, you are back in his Chaplin- esque world of screen acting, a true artist at work, and the Lon Chaney of our modern film world. He is an eccentric who has no idea he's eccentric, and when you see him suddenly being squirted by the blood of the dead as he operates on them, you instantly are given a priceless reaction that isn't 'eew', but 'I knew that was going to happen.' Depp's Ichabod Crane isn't the tall, skinny scaredy cat of the classic animated film, but a sexy crime fighter whose mind has been warped by the lessons learned in childhood. 'Villainy wears many masks. None so dangerous as the face of virtue', he says, and that is evidenced here, first by the religiously intolerant father who murdered his mother for apparent devil worship, and then by the seemingly noble perpetrator of all the evil that the headless horseman (Christopher Walken in flashbacks) must commit in order to be reunited with his missing face.There's an art to making decapitations funny, and Tim Burton works overtime to make each one of them memorable. Just as he did with 'Sweeney Todd', Burton prevents making them gory by making them hysterically funny. Yes, there is plenty of blood and carnage, and two deaths are extremely gruesome. But when heads roll, they sometimes spin first, unable to ask questions later, and in one case, Depp finds one of the heads rolling towards him in a particularly vulnerable area. Then, there is the 'tree of the dead', a visual so evil looking, that it can only be described as the entrance to another world best not visited. The next time you walk through a park or through wooded areas, you will notice trees of many different shapes and may even spot one that at night will appear much spookier than it is during the day.The cast is uniformly excellent, with Christina Ricci an appropriately vulnerable heroine (whose motives are always in question), Miranda Richardson as unforgettable as always (here, resembling Glenn Close in 'Fatal Attraction'), and a supporting cast of male stage and screen vets who each contribute in one way or another. Richard Griffiths is particularly fine as the local magistrate, and of course, Walken (doing nothing but a Frankenstein grunt) makes his evil character totally menacing. This is one of those films that you might find yourself watching over and over again (like most Tim Burton films) and sharing with those who haven't seen it. In spite of the gory nature of the story, the laughs come frequent, are never juvenile or gratuitous, and add to the fun and fast-moving nature of the Gothic tale being unfolded.",8,0,0,27 March 2014
Once," The lovers are 'Falling Slowly'; This viewer is 'Falling Fast!'
","That goes for this and the new Tony Award Winning Broadway musical based upon this sweet movie about what relationships really are all about. This independent art-house film is a winner in every way, utilizing sentiment that is slightly bittersweet yet never sappy. A troubled songwriter gets help from an unexpected source in a very independent young woman, and their friendship develops into a love that does not involve sex, but loyalty, understanding and compassion that is never patronizing. Glen Hansard and Mark√©ta Irglov√° show more humanity in 85 minutes than most Hollywood stars show in their entire careers. They are both real, extremely likable people, and Irglov√°'s character should be a candidate for sainthood. There is only a small amount of cursing; He makes an unwelcome pass that is more out of loneliness than a sexual need, and you get the feeling all he wanted was some cuddling, not fornication.The Broadway musical goes deeper into the music than this does, but no matter how many times this movie repeats its Oscar Winning song, 'Falling Slowly', I never get tired of hearing it. I saw the musical early last spring not knowing anything about the movie, only slightly recalling the song from the Academy Awards the year it won. I warned others asking me about it that they would need a package of Kleenex, and the same goes for this movie.",8,2,4,1 November 2012
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," She'll do everything for them but watch them die.
","This gets one star short of perfection for one minor thing: it is a product of its time with bouncy music montage sequences, really no full plot, and being the epitome of a popcorn picture that is aimed to please, and does. It's the anti-Bonnie and Clyde bandit film, certainly low key in its violence and often tongue in cheek funny. You can't help but love the two stars (Paul Newman and Robert Redford) and root for their characters, two train bandits who manage to charm and influence their victims, charming them in an 'Ah shucks' sort of way, and influencing them to follow the two way down south to Bolivia. Accompanying them is prim and proper school marm Katharine Ross who aids them in learning Spanish to get away with a string of clever but comical robberies which doesn't seem to be leading to the ultimate 'Sting'.There are many classic moments in this practically excellent action comedy, half western and half southern. Newman doing bike tricks for Ross, the two men stranded on a cliff over the Colorado River, and the final shootout, all used in film montages over the years. There's great character roles for many veteran faces, unknown by name (Percy Helton and Jody Gilbert for example), and a few actors in early appearances or roles before they were stars. There may not be raindrops falling on their head, but there will be smiles on your face as you root for these lovable scoundrels. Under the direction of George Roy Hill, this is near perfection.",9,1,2,21 December 2017
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," If only every other film version of a Broadway musical was like this!
","The problem in making movie versions of Broadway musicals today is that the temptation to make it so big that it comes off as pretentious has made several recent attempts rather poor. 'The Phantom of the Opera' and 'Nine' are two examples. 'Chicago' worked because having the musical numbers in Roxie's mind was an excellent choice considering her character. 'Hairspray' and 'Mamma Mia!' were simply fun summer movies that pleased the audiences that flocked to it and ended up being the 'Grease' of the modern era. In the case of 'Sweeney Todd', it was getting the right director interested in the project and a loyalty to the original show that made it the outstanding film that it is.Tim Burton has been down 'Sweeney Todd' territory before. Imagine 'Edward Scissorhands' or 'Sleepy Hollow' with songs and Burton's delightfully artistic mentality. His artistic view of 1800's London was as colorful and true to the period as 1800's New York along the Hudson was for 'Sleepy Hollow'. Who better to play Benjamin Barker/Sweeney Todd today than Johnny Depp? He actually possesses a fine singing voice, and if not as scary looking as Len Cariou or George Hearn were in the original Broadway production, he definitely brings on an aura of 'don't mess with me' from the moment his face is shown from the side in his first close-up. Actually, having him be less evil looking than his predecessors makes the character more dangerous when the wrath pops out and his mayhem begins. Helena Bonham Carter is a far cry from her predecessors too as Mrs. Lovett; She may not have the singing skills of Angela Lansbury, Dorothy Loudon or Patti LuPone, but really acts her songs very convincingly. Together, Depp and Carter remind me of a more demented Bill Sikes and Nancy from 'Oliver!'. (In fact, it would be very interesting to see what Burton could do with a remake of that musical.)Alan Rickman and Timothy Spall are appropriately malevolent as the Judge and the Beedle. In fact, Spall's Beedle is so grimy he almost seems like a beetle! His character also has a slight look of 'Batman's' penguin. Rickman's polished judge is so wonderfully evil it appears as if he has transcended into the type of characters Boris Karloff used to play. In his short time on screen, Sacha Baron Cohen is appropriately oily as Pirelli, Sweeney's first 'customer'. I just loved his Mamie Eisenhower hairstyle! Jamie Campbell Bower and Jayne Wisener do their best as Anthony and Johanna, but are overshadowed by the more colorful evil characters surrounding them. Laura Michelle Kelly as the beggar woman displays a strong Broadway style voice but is hidden behind a grotesque costume. Special credit goes to young Ed Sanders as the young Toby who is very touching, especially singing 'Nothing's Gonna Harm You'. He manages to hold his own with the stars and not be over the top. While the entire cast is great, it's Depp, Carter and Sanders that are worthy of unqualified praise.This show took almost 30 years to get to the screen, and it was worth the wait. The murders are not as horrific as one would assume them to be. In fact, they are done rather comically over a wonderful musical number sung as a montage by Depp while Bower is singing romantically in a separate interlude. Burton and the musical crew should be commended for utilizing practically the entire score, which is orchestrated beautifully and sounds like you were listening to it live. The art direction, make-up, costumes and photography are all top notch.",10,1,1,8 October 2010
The Grapes of Wrath," Finding some beauty even in the darkest of worlds.
","This tragic tale of the Joad family and their struggles living in the dust bowl during the depression is one of the great literary novels of all time. The movie version has propelled the story to legendary status and is considered one of the greatest movies of all time, sometimes even appearing in the top 10 lists of various film critics and classic movie fans. John Stenbeck's novel also became a great play in the 1990's, one of the few times in the American theater where something already so familiar to audiences could strike a cord and remain as fresh as it had been when it was first written and filmed.The tragic figure of Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) is a quiet man who has been beaten by life, and there is no getting back up for him. Already having been put in prison for murder, he knows there's no way out for the second time, an accidental killing during a riot involving unsympathetic work camp guards and striking workers. All through his journey is his devoted and loving mother, Ma Joad (Jane Darwell), who provides the voice of reason, still not quite beaten even though she definitely has the weight of the world on her shoulders through the tragedies her family has seen.If there was ever a case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time, that is the tragedy of Tom Joad's life. It seems that the fickle finger of fate is constantly pointing at him, making him doomed to suffer at the hands of chance. There's a big heart tucked away inside a soul that longs for release, and he quietly deals with every unfortunate incident of his life with grace and dignity. It is as if his life is one big shrug of the shoulder. There is no bitterness, only acceptance of the fact that this is the way his life is destined. Yet, he doesn't want to see anybody else taken down with him, particularly an embittered former preacher (John Carradine) and a sad little pipsqueak of a man (John Qualen) whom he encounters along the way.Then, there's his family, sticking together through thick and thin and never any personal judgments, especially against ex-con Fonda. Grandpa Charley Grapewin ('The Wizard of Oz', 'Tobacco Road') jumps up and down with excitement like a little kid, but the same fickle finger of fate that points at Fonda has turned into a visit by death for poor Grandpa. There are no tears in the Joad family, no maudlin cries of 'Why?', just the realization that they represent the people, always stepped on by those in authority, but some day, those meek people will inherit the earth. Two soliloquies, one by Fonda, another by Darwell, are the glue which holds this together, expressing the depths of their souls and their totally unselfish natures which only long to survive somehow, as long as they are together.The film has no real conclusion, which represents life which doesn't always have a connecting beginning, middle or end. That's the power of Stenbeck's tale, superbly directed by the amazing John Ford. Every character is there for a purpose, giving some minor players great opportunities to shine. Zeffie Tilbury, the elderly character actress who played bits in some big films and supporting roles in some 'B's' (and is best known for the feisty old lady whom Spanky, Alfalfa and the rest of 'Our Gang' encounters in 'Second Childhood') is moving as Grandma, sitting there quietly and accepting her fate, only briefly mourning her husband.Darwell, who deservedly won an Oscar, is actually a leading lady in this film, but in 1940 Hollywood, if you were portly and middle aged, you were deemed as a character actress, and character actresses (unless you were Marie Dressler) were supporting. Fonda lost his much deserved Oscar to old friend James Stewart who won pretty much because he had lost the previous year for a film he had deserved to win for. Such are the Grapes of Wrath, whether they are the bitter grapes of man's inhumanity to man or the honoring of the most honest performance of an actor's career that has nothing to do with ego but everything to do with brilliance.",10,0,1,19 December 2014
The Devil Wears Prada," You can't justify nasty behavior.
","Meryl Streep has the hands which rock the cradle, and no matter how magnificent she is, you can't escape the fact that this script promotes a real wretched view of women in power. Leona Helmsley may have been a piece of work to be employed by, but she got her come uppance through horrid publicity. Streep's Miranda Priestly is a woman who has clawed their way up to the top, and obviously has a hatred towards other women, even though she sees something in naive Anne Hathaway whom she treats with disdain even though she secretly creates plans to help her rise, bringing on ethical issues for Hathaway.I can see that Streep is having a ball in this part, barking orders and acting more imperious than an empress, tossing her designer coats on Hathaway's desk to hang up without as much as a greeting. A montage of her entrances shows what a wretched, unhappy woman Streep's character is, and in a few moments, unleashes her guard with Anne, eventually coming to depend on her while she crushes Blunt with her thumb. You really have to have nerves of steel to tolerate such degrading treatments, and Hathaway empathizes her vulnerability while never loosing a sense of who she is even though it seems that the world is being handed to her on a silver platter.Women in business are of a certain mindset and there are those who nurture and those who bully. I've had both, and there really is no justification for the pretentiousness that consumes the industry that this is set in. All this did for me was leave an element of disgust for these archetypes (male or female) who will find their day of reckoning. These are people who are miserable outside of their careers, and along with Streep, there's snooty Stanley Tucci who is the Devil has a pickle puss and Emily Blunt as a walking nervous breakdown. I see these characters every day walking to work on Park Avenue, and am disgusted by the reality as well as the fiction. This is a disappointment because it tries to justify a lifestyle that really needs an attitude adjustment.",4,3,5,12 June 2016
Grease," How many times can you revisit old pleasures?
","O.K., I'm sure that some teenagers my age saw 'Grease' more times than I did. But I must confess that in its initial run in the late Spring/early Summer of 1978, I did see it four times on the big screen. Memories of playing certain songs over and over at a club which specialized in showtunes have embedded in my mind and won't leave. Now I look upon it with jaded cynicism, but at one time during my blossoming years, it was one of my favorite movie musicals. Looking back, I have a hard time seeing much of the cast as high school seniors with only Olivia Newton John of the four leads the most acceptable, that is until she puts on those black leotards at the end, screaming early '70's hard rock rather than late '50's rebellious teen.In spite of his maturity as greaser Danny, John Travolta acts, sings and dances excellently. Stockard Channing stretches the imagination as the tough Rizzo, but actually does come out smelling like a rose otherwise, giving the most memorable performance of the four. Jeff Conaway is a close second, but I found Olivia, the youngest, to be the blandest even if she sings sweetly.Such veterans as Eve Arden, Dody Goodman, Sid Caesar, Joan Blondell and Alice Ghostley show how its really done, but Arden, in more of a featured role than a cameo, really does get the best lines in the film. Didi Conn is the best of the teen sidekicks, getting a great production number with the aid of veteran '60's teen, Frankie Avalon. Jersey Boy Frankie Valli gets to introduce the title song, while the camp boy group Sha Na Na is a delight in the prom sequence.If you can get past the age of the four leads, you will find a lot to enjoy in this musical blockbuster that held the record for most successful movie musical ever for years. It came at a time when nostalgia was king and my generation of teens looked on at our parents from that generation as (at least for a while) as pretty cool. This isn't among the best movie musical adaption of a Broadway hit, but for all its success, it must have done something right.",7,0,0,16 August 2016
The Caine Mutiny," Powerful performances aid a strong psychological drama of what it means to be a leader.
","NOTE: The later part of this review reveals certain spoilers and twists of the later part of the film. It is best read by those who have seen the film and are interested in how others view the film's message.While this is not the usual type of film I would choose to review (as it is one of the all time classics of American cinema), I chose to make my feelings of it known based on one interesting fact I picked up in observing several characters-particularly Humphrey Bogart's Queeg and Fred MacMurray's Keefer. It is apparent at the very beginning of the film that the embittered Keefer would like to get out of the Navy as soon as he can, but his underhanded manipulations of his fellow officers and own cowardess himself makes him one of the more interesting villains in film history. MacMurray compares the new arrival Bogart on the U.S.S. Caine to Captain Bligh, an interesting choice both considering the subject matter and the leading actors between this 1954 masterpiece and the 1935 hit 'Mutiny on the Bounty'. Charles Laughton's Captain Bligh is as far removed from Bogart's Queeg as Billie Hayes' Witchipoo in 'H.R. Pufnstuff' is to Margaret Hamilton's Witch of the West in 'The Wizard of Oz'. They are completely different types of people.Bogart's Queeg is a man of some charm and sensitivities, but when his nerves hit, paranoia strikes and he becomes quite irrational. There are moments when Queeg actually appears to be what today is called bi-polar. In fact, his paranoia is a symptom of a greater mental illness. In the scene where Bogart pleads with his fellow officers to understand him and give him a chance without paying with his pride, he reveals another dimension to this character that hadn't earlier been seen. The scene where he yells at Robert Francis's ensign for not fulfilling his duties to make sure the sailors keep their shirts tucked in is topped by another scene where Bogart then calmly tells Francis to forget about what happened. The switch from violent anger to gentleness is not a sign of insanity, but of something more treatable yet equally as dangerous if it isn't discovered.But it's the revelation of MacMurray's villainy which is the highpoint of the drama. How he manipulates fellow officers Van Johnson and Robert Francis into considering mutiny, then betrays them on the witness stand after Johnson has reluctantly gone through with it, is the most surprising twist in this psychological drama. And when Jose Ferrer, as Johnson's reluctant attorney, drunkenly tells MacMurray off, that is the crowning moment to this drama. The only disappointing thing for me (other than the unnecessary plot line of Francis's overbearing mother and love for May Wynn) is that it would have been nice to see the treatment that Bogart's Queeg would get after the trial was over. Also, the fact that Johnson and Francis's feelings about Queeg went from hatred to pity could be explored a bit more. In many ways, this story is a bit ahead of its time in its tale of a form of mental illness that would not be given an actual name for many years.",9,0,1,28 December 2010
American Beauty," A glorification of the destruction of the American family.
","Hollywood used to give Oscars to films of consequence, to films which ambitiously told stories of real people rising above strife and issues which touched the core of the world. But that was during the golden age of movie making when Andy Hardy's mother would smile simply because he asked for another piece of pie and Fred Astaire would gallantly guide Ginger Rogers around the dance floor. When movies about serious issues such as alcoholism, mental illness and anti-Semitism came in, one movie mogul apparently described it with the statement about realism, 'So is diarrhea, but I don't want to see it on screen.' Yes, we can see through our daily lives that 'focus on the family' is an overstated attempt by certain groups to diminish the realism that families do fail, and not with the help of the groups they don't see eye to eye with. In theatrical drama, this evidence goes back to some of the classics of the American theater, particularly plays by Tennessee Williams and Edward Albee, and those plays hold up strongly today because the elements of why those families were failing were better detailed. Even the black comedy 'The War of the Roses' showed us the motivations behind the hatred, but all 'American Beauty' does is show us that men are sex starved pigs, that women are bitches, that teenagers are messed up because of their sex starved fathers and bitchy mothers and that there's no hope for the future generation.Certainly, this film is excellent as far as the acting is concerned, yet the characters are all extremely creepy and unlikable. Nobody plays creepy weirdos better than Kevin Spacey, and in spite of being that creepy weirdo, his character is actually somewhat understandable, albeit in a pathetic, you can't help but feel sorry for him sort of way. His lust for his nasty daughter's best friend is at first 'ikky' to watch as is his obsession with getting out of the job that he hates with a high paid exit benefit package. Annette Bening is certainly great at playing neurotic bitches, and here she does so quite brilliantly with passive/aggressive gusto. She's quite sweet and somewhat phony with the gay couple next door, yet she turns on her husband with the venom of a cobra towards a mongoose. The sex scene she has with rival real estate agent Peter Gallagher is filmed with a lustful anger, as if what Gallagher is doing to her she is psychologically doing to her husband.Thora Birch expresses typical teenaged bitterness and insecurities with the violent thud of an anvil being dropped from a skyscraper. She not only hates her parents, but is totally embarrassed by having them around, especially after a basketball game for which she is a cheerleader. Birch's character certainly doesn't have the personality of a cheerleader; In fact, on the court, she can't even force herself to crack a smile and just goes through the routine as if she was being forced at gunpoint to do what most teenaged girls would give their I-Phone (well, maybe not...) to do.Mena Suvari, as her cheerleader pal, is probably the most complex character here, the typically self-centered supposedly perfect girl who actually is more insecure than she lets on. In one disturbing fight scene between Birch and Suvari, her vulnerability really explodes when Birch refers to her as ordinary. How many times has somebody longed to tell off the cheerleader type to try and break their spirit, and when it happens here, it really turns out to be sad. Wes Bentley is the new kid next door, the son of an ex-Marine (a truly scary Chris Cooper), forced by his dad to take a drug test every six months. But unbeknownst to the homophobic Cooper, Bentley has a secret life of his own, a hidden supply of drugs and an obsession with filming everyone around him without their knowledge.Cooper's angry Marine is instantly incensed to find out that the neighbors two doors down is a male gay couple, but this homophobia hides something truly disturbing. Not only is there his obsession with Nazi memorabilia but his own underlying sexuality and abuse of his fragile wife (played with quiet strength by the always excellent Allison Janney). The lives of these characters intertwine to the point of an exploding volcano, a sinking ship without lifeboats, and really, the best escape from this mess turns out to be Spacey's fate. At two hours, this is a depressing and exhausting view of the messed up lives of humans too stupid to realize that they are responsible in most part for their inner destruction. After this was over, I felt as if I had been shot with a taser gun all over my body and needed extensive therapy just to recover from watching these people whom I hope never to know become more and more pathetic.",4,5,12,14 January 2015
Judgment at Nuremberg," Certain to be a nominee for Best Ensemble of a Movie, Ever!
","The great television dramas of the 1950's and 1960's lead to full-length movie versions, and one of the best was Abby Mann's 'Judgment at Nuremberg', a re-creation of the infamous Nuremberg trials where Nazi war criminals were forced to re-live their great evils and face the judgment of the world. It is the late 1940's, and Germany is in chaos. Remainders of great arenas where Hitler once spoke to the masses to refrains of 'Seek Heil!' echoing in his ears were now piles of rubble, destroyed by Ally bombers. American judge Spencer Tracy arrives in Nuremberg to lead the proceedings at the trials, and as the echoes of Alex North's brilliant score fills the viewers ears, he sees the sites of many of these gatherings which lead to Hitler's children becoming excited of following every evil order he planned with the help of the S.S. and other evil Nazi organizations.Defending the war criminals on trial is emotional attorney Maximillian Schell, giving the performance of his career for which he deservedly received an Academy Award. He had played this part on television and added even more detail in his characterization. What makes his performance so riveting is the fact that you don't hate him for the job he is doing, even if you hate the people he is trying to defend. One of them is a slightly over the top Burt Lancaster, complete with German accent, as a Nazi doctor accused of some heinous crimes. More subtle is Marlene Dietrich as a deceased German general's wife whom Tracy befriends, showing the human side of people involved on what was obviously the wrong side of the war.Supporting Oscar nominations went to Judy Garland and Montgomery Clift who both play victims of the Nazi atrocities. While some Hollywood press representatives considered these parts cameos, both actors really put some depth into making their characterizations stand out. Garland, plump and blowsy, shows that she really had what it took to move from musical diva to character performer, and her accent is totally believable. Clift, still emotionally wrecked after his scarring car accident, uses the sadness within himself to convey the inhumane treatment he went through under Nazi tortures.For a subject so glum and a film of extreme length, 'Judgment at Nuremberg' never drags, and becomes more fascinating as the plot is developed. Perhaps it is because the subject matter still touches us to this day and we feel for each of the characters as they try to go on with their lives even after the horrendous experiences they went through. It is also a reminder to the world that we've been through this before, made the villains pay, and future villains will pay as well.",9,1,3,29 August 2014
Duck Soup," Groucho gives the best State of the Union speech ever written.
","'If you think this country's bad off now, just wait till I get through with it', Groucho sings while being sworn in as President of Fredonia (no relation to the small New York city in Chautaqua County) where he actually rules as dictator. Ironically the same year as the rise of Hitler in Germany, this parallels the absurdities of dictatorships with Groucho not apologizing in any manner for his promise of 'We stand them up against the wall and pop goes the weasel' for breaking any law he passes. Of course, he can't get out of his house because every time he does, his chauffeur (Harpo!) takes off in the motorcycle, leaving Groucho behind in the sidecar, and later switching places with hysterical results.With a name like Rufus T. Firefly, you know what kind of character Groucho is going to be, especially when he makes a pass at his benefactor, the wealthy Mrs. Teasdale (Margaret Dumont, back with the boys after a two-picture absence), all the while insulting her at the same time. He creates an instant rivalry with the ambassador from another country (an imperious Louis Calhern) and when war is declared, all zany hell breaks loose. There's even a minstrel show musical number about the declaration of the war, and with Harpo and Chico as spies, you know that the spying game is going to be downright hysterical. Chico and Harpo take up in a zany argument with fellow street vendor Edgar Kennedy which has some truly outrageous visual gags. Raquel Torres takes over for Thelma Todd, vixen from the previous two entries here, but no vixen, no matter how sexy, can get one over on Groucho. Ironically, the director this time around is Leo McCarey who usually went for sentiment. Here, the atmosphere is downright parody of an unsettled world on the verge of another war, perhaps a little ahead of its time, but a film that today is considered ingenious and probably the most famous of the Marxx Brothers' films. It was so controversial in its day that the politicians from the real Fredonia, New York wrote to Groucho in protest. You know who came out the winner.",10,5,6,9 April 2014
Edward Scissorhands," The parallels of so many other stories are there in this sweet fantasy.
","I remember sitting in the theater when this first came out and totally blown away by the snow drifting over the 20th Century Fox logo and the sudden influx of the Danny Elfman music which drifted me off into the fantasy world of this strange suburb world where a castle on a strategically placed mountaintop once was the residence for a sweet old man so desperate for a son, he created the title character. In the prologue of this film, beloved thespian Vincent Price saunters along the corridors of his castle, preparing to give his invented son Edward (Johnny Depp) everything he needed, that is, besides hands, which unfortunately were never able to be placed on him.Swing down to earth where unlucky Avon lady (Dianne Wiest in her most perfect mom role) decides to trek up to the castle and make a sale. There she meets the lonely Edward and brings him home. But as fascinated as the family is with Edward and his scissorhands, there's also a danger there as the enchanted neighbors take all sorts of interest in the newcomer to their community. Kathy Baker's flirtatious Peg obviously lusts over him with ambrosia salad, cheery Conchata Ferrell takes him into be sharpened, but there's also warnings from a religious obsessed neighbor who thinks him evil.There is evil in the valley, but it's not through the Frankenstein Monster/Pinocchio/Jesus Christ like Edward. He instills joy both with his haircuts and with his trimming of the local shrubbery. It's through the boyfriend of Wiest's daughter, Winona Ryder, obviously jealous of the growing affection between Ryder and Depp. Anthony Michael Hall gives a disturbing performance as the cheery on the outside jock who is all nastiness on the inside, getting Edward involved in a crime, and resulting in a chase sequence that results in a confrontation back at the castle.While the plot requires some sort of violence in order to create the necessary tension, that doesn't take over the film, which is a series of vignettes of how Edward fares in regular society after being alone for so long. His neighbors love him as long as everything is cookies and paper machete cut-outs, but once fear strikes into their hearts, Edward is an outcast. Even the injured war vet who once compared his metal leg with Edward's hands now calls him a freak, and cheery Farrell threatens to call the police after a misunderstanding. It comments on society how something new and unknown can be exciting but once the reality sets in, people no longer accept it. Depp is sensitive in his sweet persona, and his chemistry with Ryder is undeniable.As the parents, Wiest and Alan Arkin are a constant delight. In a performance I felt award worthy, Wiest is funny and touching, applying Depp's face with all sorts of cold cremes (of all colors) to fix the cuts on his face from his own scissors. Arkin gives a totally unaffected performance, his character so in awe of life as it happens, his child-like qualities exploding, even when he insists to Edward that you can't pay bills with cookies. The presence of Price in one of his last acting roles truly is touching. Try not to tear up as you see the beloved master of horror doing what he does best, entertaining, and influencing today's generations of superstars and creative film makers.There's some comical touches that are impossible not to stick in the mind; The old lady at the beginning, telling her granddaughter the story, has an irony of familiarity to her, and the poor little girl lost in the huge bed, is awestruck not only by the story but by the constantly falling snow outside. It isn't hard to figure out why the narrative is the way it is, and when the old lady says her last line and that Danny Elfman music strikes up again, be prepared for the tears to flow once again.",10,4,5,7 September 2013
Dreamgirls," Finally! They get it right!
","You've got 'One Time Only' to turn a hit Broadway show into a great movie musical, and in the case of 'Dreamgirls', they managed to avoid it going down the path of 'Man of LaMancha', 'Mame', 'A Little Night Music', 'A Chorus Line', 'The Phantom of the Opera' and 'Nine' for hit shows that ended up becoming missed opportunities. All is well in the world of the 'Dreams', the fictional version of the Supremes who won the hearts of musical theater fans back in the early 1980's and made a huge star out of Jennifer Holliday who belted 'And I Am Telling You' right out of the Imperial Theater.The Holliday has switched to the Hudson for the role of Effie White, the power-house singer based upon the real life Florence Ballard. While Jennifer Holliday won a Tony Award, Jennifer Hudson went home with the Oscar, and in tribute to both ladies, they would later perform the big Effie number later together. Ms. Holliday continues to play this role in various theaters around the country, while Hudson's status as a star once rejected by Simon Cowell proves that what 'Simon Says' doesn't always ring true.For a 'fictional' biography of the Supremes, you have to have a great Deena Jones, the glamorous representation of Diana Ross. Unlike the real 'Miss Ross', Deena Jones is presented as somebody who might have stardom within her reach, but her 'diva' presence isn't as strong as her real-life counterpart. She is certainly more down-to-earth and seemingly sweeter, not to cast a shadow on Diana Ross's character. She just comes off as somebody much more approachable than the real legend. The current day top diva of the pop world, Beyonce, brings a very likable quality to Deena, absolutely sympathetic to Effie's situation and more than compassionate when she learns the truth about what transpired between her and Curtis (the magnificent Jamie Fox). Rising Broadway star Anika Noni Rose is fantastic as Lorrell, the third of the original 'Dreams', but her role isn't as well developed as Effie and Deena, although it is clear that her character is based on Mary Wilson.Giving one of his all-time showiest performance, Eddie Murphy is phenomenal as James 'Thunder' Early, and watching his breakdown is as heartbreaking as the real-life destructions of various great artists who became legends way before their time should have been up. Danny Glover is 'Earth Father' as the older adviser, and Keith Robinson shows much vulnerability as Effie's brother who is torn between a rock and a hard place when it comes to choosing between his own ideals and his love for his sister.One of the reasons that the original Supremes are so important in music history is that they helped integrate the world of pop music. White audiences took them to their hearts, and that is certainly obvious in how the 'Dreams' are portrayed. The obvious comparisons between the fact and fiction is very present with a young boy obviously playing Michael Jackson, and if you see the Broadway musical 'Motown', you will see why some critics called that show basically a re-tread of 'Dreamgirls', only with the real names attached. The racial tensions which lead to riots in the 1960's in Detroit where Motown was located and where this partially takes place are covered in both stories, so it doesn't matter if you're listening to 'Stop in the Name of Love' or 'One Night Only', the importance of the political and social story is equally as important.Original Broadway 'Dreamgirl' Loretta Devine makes a nice impression in a small role, and several other Broadway favorites turn up in smaller parts. While 'Dreamgirls' has not returned to Broadway since the late 1980's, a recent tour did stop in New York, ironically at the Apollo, where part of this also takes place. The fast-moving and engrossing drama, surrounded by a fantastic score, will keep you riveted. When Jennifer Hudson sings her song of atonement, 'I am Changing', you may find yourself in tears, and when Beyonce sings the original 'Listen' (written for the movie, included in the most recent tour), you may be standing up cheering as well. Bravo, Hollywood, for turning our 'Dreamgirls' into a movie musical dream come true.",8,0,0,5 August 2014
54," Divine decadence doesn't cast stones...once you're inside.
","This is 'Goodfellas' meets 'Valley of the Dolls', a deliciously trashy example of the dark side of night life that is legendary even today. Oh, the many ghosts I've felt walking through the doors of the former disco, now a legitimate Broadway theater that transitioned from nightclub to stage with the classic German expression of decadence, 'Cabaret'. Nightclubs still have a strict door policy like this, but 54 made it famous, even if it wasn't the first. This thrives on the disco beat of the late '70s/early '80s, tossing in obvious corruption from behind the scenes from a manager who was ingenious in many ways but idiotic and careless in a ton of others. 'I've been to a marvelous party', Noel Coward wrote, but as his muse, Elaine Stritch, admitted, some of those marvelous parties really weren't so marvelous.It's a fantasy land that makes reality tedious, and for bar-back turned successful bartender Ryan Phillipe, that marvelous party turns out to be the key to the door to his possible destruction, turning him from a basically decent kid from Jersey City to an absolute phony. As for Michael Meyers' Steve Rubell, well, I don't like to speak ill of the dead, but he was as sleazy as they come, never realizing the self destruction his doomed success has him headed towards.I have to call this a guilty pleasure, a fun bad movie, and a reminder of my own party days which in many respects, as a whole, were not really marvelous. Ellen Albertini Dow, one of the cutest of little old ladies, is unforgettably lovable as Disco Dotty, a fictionalized version of a real character, and all she's missing is the cat and the birdcage to be a dancin' granny with a Tweety bird. The narration by Philippe gives this a pedestrian feel, with a feeling of nostalgia that lasts as long as the club stays open, but the feeling of sleaze has the same impact as a Sunday morning hangover. I may not be able to read minds, but I do know the difference between classic art and a framed poster that ends up in the trash after its owner realizes its true value. But for those of us who were there for lights and beat, this is a nice memory that soon is as forgotten as one of those cheap book store posters.",3,1,3,8 November 2016
Gandhi," He wanted to change their minds, not kill them for weaknesses everybody possesses.
","Don't fear the 191 minute running time in this masterful epic that explains in a forward that documenting a year in someone's life like Gandhi is difficult enough, let alone a lifetime. The film starts at the end, with his assassination, where Ghandi simply exclaims 'Oh no!' as he collapses. Going back more than 50 years, the young Gandhi is explaining his desires for peaceful protests which seem impossible in any era, yet HW persists. Multiple beatings, arrests, court appearances and public speeches keeps that ideal working, making this a lesson in how a huge nation under the control of another got its independence in ways clever, subtly manipulative, often tragic, yet ultimately triumphant.This 191 minute epic then does indeed fly by, featuring one of the greatest screen portrayals of one of the greatest men ever. Ben Kingsley may not be a star, but his performance here gave him household name status, and years later, Steven Spielberg cast Kingsley as a Jewish man working with a non Jewish man to keep Jews out of the concentration camps, it was a reminder of how subtlety in acting creates a great portrayal that doesn't seem like acting at all. Kingsley is transformed into one of the great heroes of the 20th Century and not only looks like Gandhi for over 50 years of his life but makes you believe that he is Gandhi.Under the incredible direction of Sir Richard Attenborough, this historical epic is brought to life. An all-star cast supports him, but many of the actors are only on for a few moments. The script shows that not all the British people in India were rotten, that a few came to the cause because they changed, some didn't have to because they believed in complete equality, and some were downright brutal. This also shows how Indian women were as involved in the fight as men were; in fact, his wife stands up to him in ways that would cause other men instantly kill or beat them. But not the gentle, peace loving Fandi, shown to have minor flaws but with fairness and dignity.I first fell in love with the Indian countryside in 'A Passage to India', and unfortunately feared that 191 running time in spite of the praise and awards heaped upon it. Unknowns outside of John Gielgud, Martin Sheen and Candice Bergen could have cast in their stead, and the film would remain as potent. But bravo to the casting of Ben Kingsley, because it would take somebody of enormous charisma to play Ghandi and make me not think of him. This is absolutely spectacular.",10,1,1,20 September 2017
Duck You Sucker," You get two revolutions for the price of one.
","My first spaghetti western is a classic, one that seems long by looking at the running time, but grabs you immediately and does not let go. A Mexican bandit hooks up with an Irish revolutionary and gets more than he bargained for as he ends up becoming a hero to his own people reluctantly, not even wanting to be. At first glance, Rod Steiger seems an odd choice to play the Mexican, but he is not only convincing, but extremely funny and likable even playing a rather disreputable character. Teamed with James Coburn, he's fiery, while Coburn is passionate but subtle as the Irish revolutionary who shows him more than a thing or two about carrying a fistful of dynamite.The film starts off with Steiger as a passenger in the carriage heading over the Mexican wilderness, and the sudden arrival of Steiger's familia, presented in a way that is fast, furious and funny! Yes, it's violent and cruel, ending up with surviving naked men and one scantily clothed woman heading back in the wilderness with the open wagon suddenly tossing them over, a symbolism of the ghastly poor getting it over on the cruel and idle rich. But then along comes Coburn as a man on his own mission, telling Steiger and the gang, 'Duck, you sucker', blowing things up in the cleverest of ways.If other spaghetti westerns are as entertaining as this, I'm about to go on a spree, especially those directed by Sergio Leone. I'm glad that Clint Eastwood is not in this one, having pretty much been a part of the beginning of the genre, but not right for any of the roles here. Steiger and Coburn are as different as can be, but they play off of each other nicely. This is an exciting adventure and buddy film that brings two culturally different men together to share common ideals that may seem foreign to the common man not into fighting a revolution, but remaining potent and stirring nearly 50 years later.",8,2,3,9 November 2016
Enchanted," Sappy fairy tale meets Cynical New York.
","I'll give this bloated ball of sugar one high five, making me laugh and gag at the same time. The animated opening had me checking the film's running time as a cloyingly sweet princess to be sings of 'Happily Ever After' while the grating handsome prince prepares for his wedding day while a wicked queen plots to send her where there are no happily ever afters. That of course leads her to coming out of a manhole right in the middle of Times Square, causing me to become distracted by Broadway theater marquees (circa 2007), one ironically displaying 'Wicked' which originally starred Idina Menzel who appears here in a non-singing role as the neurotic fianc√©e of the hero who happens to rescue princess Amy Adams after bumping into her during her struggle to figure out where the heck she is and what she is going to do.Call me cynical, jaded, or even bitter, but I far more enjoyed the reactions of the New Yorkers as they responded to the strange characters all of a sudden wandering the streets. Of course, as New Yorkers are used to strange characters are roaming the streets but one thing we do not do unless it is on a Broadway stage or in a film like this, break out into song in the middle of the street. There is a slight gay sensibility to this that strives for camp, not always a good idea to do purposely. Some moments seem straight out of the West Village Halloween parade. The songs themselves are rather mediocre, each sounding like the previous one and none of them really memorable. I am certainly praying that this is not in the lineup of Broadway musicals, because I certainly would like to see something fresh on stage not rehashed fairy tale stuff that has been done on stage over and over again. This also perpetuates the stereotype that women are princesses and must find their handsome prince in order to be happy, while the realism of the world is much stronger and creates much disappointment to the young girls who get used to this and find out that real life is not always happily ever after. In looking for handsome prince to sweep then way too, the girls obsessed with fairy tale like this find out the realism of the situation of what man and women are like in real life.But there are some wonderful surprises, and I give the creators credit for trying something unique. I would have liked to have seen more of Susan Sarandon as the evil queen, joining in the ranks of Glenn Close, Sigourney Weaver and Anjelica Huston who have gone from serious dramatic roles to the deliciously campy. Sarandon get a glorious entrance and that I wouldn't mind seeing on stage, just not in a stage musical version of this.",5,0,0,28 May 2016
Flashdance," It's a weird dream, but it's her dream.
","So this movie, the first film I saw at the Chinese Grauman's upon moving to L.A., has one of the great 80's soundtracks of all time, in addition to a standard Cinderella story of a struggling dancer who wants to get out of her nighttime exotic dancing job into one of the big dance schools in Pittsburgh. She works as a welder to make a living and deals with all sorts of sexual harassment which she handles like a pro. She's certainly able to take care of herself and nobody's going to mess with her unless she wants to be messed with. She's Jennifer Beals, a sort of here today, whatever happened to them tomorrow sort of star who hasn't quite had the A list career she started off with, but then she hasn't quite faded into obscurity either. I found her very likable and wanted to see more of her, but if there's anything in her career that she'll always be remembered for, at least as a cult actress, it will be 'Flashdance'.This has a rough around the edges feel to it with its Pittsburgh street life view, and director Adrian Lyne ('Fatal Attraction') gets much of the gritty side of that Pennsylvania city quite right. She has the right man (the handsome Michael Nouri) and the right attitude to succeed in finding her dreams, so what a feeling you know she'll have once that dream is achieved. She also has her own real life fairy godmother (Oscar winning Lilia Skala), so there's never any doubt that this will have the standard Hollywood ending. Kyle T. Heffner is amusing as Beals' struggling stand-up comic pal. While a decent actress with presence, Beals does not do her own dancing which gave this film some bad press when it came out with all of the out of work dancers/actresses possibly more qualified for the role. The music is fun, the energy filled with a really retro 80's atmosphere, and in spite of being cheesy when I look back on it nearly 35 years later, I have fond memories of it.",6,0,0,24 January 2017
Gone with the Wind," Fact or fiction about a fictional family in the old south? You must research, then decide!
","Happy darkies singing in the fields, a black mammy whose white master's children are just like her own, a slave who lies about being experienced and birthin' babies (and getting violently slapped for lying), brutal Northern soldiers invading the dilapidated Southern plantation, and a spoiled heroine determined that she will make it through no matter if she has to lie, kill, cheat or steal make up the story for this all-time classic epic that nearly 40 years after its release still hadn't been on television, and when it did, it was an event to equal the legendary T.V. mini-series 'Roots'.Much has been made about the casting for the film, from the smaller parts way up to the leads, and that itself has enough plot for a movie of its own. One part of the T.V. mini-series 'Moviola' dealt with the search for Scarlet, and a sequel novel, 'Scarlet', was a much awaited for mini-series. Even two musicals (which never hit Broadway) attempted to tell the long, drawn-out story. But it is the original film, following the best selling book by Margaret Mitchell, that remains the most famous of the variations of the story, often imitated but never surpassed.No movie audience by 1939 had ever seen anything like this on screen, and even if there had been color movies, none were as exciting or detailed as this. The opening credits are fascinating, only mentioning the leading players, and it even appears that David O. Selznick's office building is indeed the model for Tara, the Southern plantation where the O'Hara family has built up its roots from Irish immigrants to powerful landowners with dozens of slaves. Spoiled Scarlet (Vivien Leigh) is being entranced by two beaus as the film opens, but it is next door neighbor Ashley (Leslie Howard) whom she really loves. He is flattered by her attentions (after all, she is gorgeous and charming in spite of her spoiled nature) but it is the noble and quiet Melanie (Olivia de Havilland) he really loves. This, however, is the eve of the beginning of the Civil War, and if the South is to survive, the men must go off to fight and the women must persevere mostly alone.Scarlet's own nature keeps getting her into all sorts of trouble, even stealing the beaus away from her own sisters (Ann Rutherford and Evelyn Keyes) in order to keep the attention on her. Father Thomas Mitchell and mother Barbara O'Neill must persevere on alone, and a twice-widowed Scarlet soon finds herself being squired around by the dashing rascal, Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) whom she met on the eve of the beginning of the war (which threatened to ruin all the best parties Scarlet hoped to attend) and whom she dances with in widow's wear much to the shock of Atlanta society.Then, there's the goings-on at the country plantation Tara where Scarlet is spoiled not only by her parents but by no-nonsense slave Hattie McDaniel who tries to bring Scarlet to some sort of reality but can't. Scarlet finds that she does have a best girlfriend in Melanie whom she must help out of a burning Atlanta while Melanie is in labor, and back at the now desolate Tara, she has to deal with so much more. Will Scarlet make it through the war with ruined crops, dead parents and lecherous Northerners? Most certainly, and when she sees a chance to get some financial help from Rhett, she's not even beyond wearing an old curtain (minus the rod), leading into the next stage of her life as she must now deal with what the new South calls the re-construction. If adding a third husband means security, she's willing to tie the knot with Rhett (for what he refers to as a marriage of fun), even if in one controversial scene, she is obviously forced into sexual relations with him, waking up the next morning as a new happy woman.But can someone like Scarlet be truly happy? The writer shows her transformation from spoiled young lady to a more layered maturing woman, still willful yet not as selfish as before. More tragedies follow, and ultimately the story must, after more than 3 hours wrap up to show that Scarlet has changed and that she has learned that her life doesn't simply wrap around her always receiving male attention while the women around her are secondary. She begins to appreciate everybody, from the devoted Mamie to even Melanie, and isn't even judgmental anymore against the obvious madame Belle Watling (Ona Munson) who once obviously 'entertained' husband Rhett.Clark Gable's mere presence in this means that supporting character Rhett Butler becomes a leading one, even if he has much less footage than Leigh. She dominates the screen every time she is on, a soap opera heroine from long before soap operas even existed. McDaniel stands out as the wise Mamie who can bark at other slaves and her white owners, yet be flattered by Rhett's attentions to her and cry when tragedy strikes her beloved Scarlet. In different hands, Melanie Wilkes could have been a very bland character, but there's something in Olivia de Havilland's eyes that shows the soul and spirit, even if not outlandish like Scarlet's, she is still as long-suffering yet quietly strong.Butterfly McQueen adds some humor and patheticness as kitchen slave Prissy, with Jane Darwell and Laura Hope Crews bringing wisdom and humor as members of Atlanta's society. The cast is huge, featuring some long-forgotten faces in smaller roles. The photography, art direction and musical score are all exceptional, and even if the depiction of slavery and the aftermath of slavery have been more realistically depicted, what is shown here can be made to seem believable, for as Mamie herself might have said, 'Where would we go?'. Not quite flawless, although considering the time and situation, it certainly could not have been made to be any better.",10,6,10,13 May 2015
Mamma Mia!," Experience the joy of one of the great movie musicals ever!
","OK, I have to start off by saying that if the wedding took place at the far end of the island and you had to walk to get there from where Meryl Streep and Pierce Brosnan had their confrontation, I think they'd still be walking, 'cause down the hill, up the hill, and it ain't as close as it looks. But that is minor, because the music of Abba and the gorgeous Greek scenery is what makes this movie so special. Not much has changed in the movie from its stage origins with the exception of the fact that film opens the story up to be so much larger, so much more gorgeous. It's a simple story, basically the same plot line as 'Buona Sera Mrs Campbell' with songs (already having been musicalized as the short-lived 'Sarava') with a young girl inviting three men to her wedding with the assumption that one of them is her father. Meryl Streep, her hard-working mother, left a diary behind that gave the bride to be (Amanda Seyfried) the clues to pop's possible identity.Christine Baranski and Julie Walters, total opposites if there ever were total opposites, are Streep's two long-time best friends. While Baranski's character seems to be a duplicate of her 'Cybil' sidekick character Mary Anne, she makes her much more well rounded, giving a compassion, zest for life and even a bigger lust for young men, flirting 'innocently' with the groom's sexy black pal (Philip Michael) who is obviously a cougar chaser. Walters is hysterically funny as a best selling cookbook author who gets her chance to shine by chasing after one of the possible three dads (Stellan Skarsg√•rd) in the delightfully witty version of 'Take a Chance on Me'. Streep, who has already established herself as the biggest living legend in film's today, had already sung on screen ('Postcards From the Edge', 'Death Becomes Her') and this seems to have led her into becoming the first choice for movie versions of hit Broadway musicals. (Up next possibly, 'Follies' I hear...)Of course, there's a lot of people who admitted to laughing every time that Pierce Brosnan attempted to sing, but do you expect James Bond to sing like Howard Keel? Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsg√•rd do better with their singing parts, while the younger actors are obviously trained as singers. It seems like every time you blink, somebody is breaking into an Abba song, and while some of the songs seem sort of forced into the plot, for the most part it works. There are also moments when the music becomes so passionate that pure joy takes over and this literally explodes on screen when the weakened structure of Streep's gorgeous inn explodes with a watery fountain from the sea beneath. It's ironic that the biggest hit musicals of Broaday shows are the light-hearted comedies, and 'Mamma Mia!' deserves its place as one of the best of the past 20 years.",8,0,1,6 August 2015
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Into these woods I wouldn't like to go.
","But you've got to go through the woods to get to the mountain to slay the dragon, and what a venture it is. I wouldn't want to face the giant, blood thirsty spiders who will argue with each other after bundling you up before they go for your blood. I wouldn't want to face the various creatures who also dread the dragon but refuse to help the dwarfs (lead by the handsome and fearless Thorin) and the ring wearing invisible Hobbit Bilbo Baggins. Anxious to tell wizard Gandolf about the ring, Bilbo simply says he's found his courage. He'll find a lot more than that before this adventure is over. Even worse than these human looking creatures with dark souls filled with prejudices, there's also the demonic looking creatures who serve the dragon, a heroic female (Cate Blanchette) and a cursed creature whose form keeps changing against his will. It was established in the first film the judgmental prejudices between dwarfs and hobbits, bonded together because of a common cause, a metaphor if ever I saw one for a reason that humans must band together to fight the evil human dragons who threaten to destroy peace and freedom today.There literally is a sequence where Bilbo and the dwarfs go over some dangerous falls in barrels, nifty action battle sequences, and of course, middle earth enemy #1, the dragon Smaug. I've had mixed feelings about these often loud fantasy franchises, whether too set in the world of the dark arts or so over the top with computer generated special effects. So I keep these in perspective and am overjoyed when like this, they are actually highly above average. It's difficult to realize where live action filming begins and computer generated effects begin, but as long as there's characters you genuinely root for, then I am in favor of them. Most of the rest, not so much.",8,0,1,5 September 2017
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Children's literature for adults.
","One of the very first 'adult' examples of modern literature I had to study in school was the fantastic literature if J.R. Tolkien. With 'Lord of the Rings' and 'The Hobbit' being the 'Harry Potter' series of their day, they were instant classics that succeeded in their efforts to get pre-teenagers to read. In fact, they were so popular with advanced English literature teachers that I got to study them twice: first in my eighth grade English class, and later in High School in a rather adult version of 'children's literature'.Around that time, both 'The Hobbit' and 'Lord of the Rings' were filmed-'The Hobbit' as an animated T.V. feature and 'Lord of the Rings' for the big screen. Both were produced by Rankin Bass, and only covered the highlights of the novels. It took a few more decades for these to come out as big screen remakes, and when they did, great detail was made to capture everything. The wait was worth it, because the results were outstanding.Tied together through several supporting characters, 'Lord of the Rings' and 'The Hobbit' are never the less completely different stories, set in the mysterious 'middle world' where bizarre creatures live around hobbits, dwarfs, elves, wizards and earth like mammals. Trolls, goblins, giant rock like creatures and huge spiders are among the feared creatures, but they don't compare to the fearful dragon whose love for gold helped destroy one of the middle world's finest lands.Certainly, the computer generated effects makes this all the more intense, with the battle scenes quite realistic and brutal. Leading the story is the mild mannered Bilbo Baggins, the homebody hobbit who is brought into the adventure of a lifetime. Gandfolf, the wizard, takes over Bilbo's hole in the hill, and before you can break into the Jabberwocky, you're out in the woods, fighting all these various evil creatures to help dethroned prince Thorin recapture his kingdom, now being guarded by the evil dragon, Smaug.Continuing his role as Gandolf is that wonderful stage veteran Sir Ian MacKellan, finely supporting Martin Freeman as Bilbo. This covers the first quarter of the book, taking the audience through many adventures in a fast moving three hours. Whether it be Bilbo's capture by the trolls, the sudden fight between moving rock formations or the final battle with the goblins, you will never find yourself bored. You might want to keep aspirin near by just in case, as the sound through your stereo may become a bit overwhelming. This isn't the type of series to rush through non-stop, but watch pieces at a time. Then, you might want to re-visit the Ray Harryhausen classics of the golden age which highly influenced either Tolkien or the filmmakers, or possibly both.",8,0,2,16 May 2016
The Princess Bride," Sweet fantasy where tongue in cheek on occasionally goes overboard.
","While this was the film that introduced Robin Wright to movie audiences, if you were watching the daytime soap opera Santa Barbara in the mid-1980s you already knew her as the sweet Kelly Capwell, the rich heiress who was as long suffering as her character is here. Taking time off from that show to make this movie, it was only a matter of time before she would leave the world of daytime TV behind and go on to become a bona fide movie star. Truly likable on screen, she is the perfect movie heroine. unlike other ones who have come and gone since the 1980s, she has proved herself to be a talent as well as a beauty, and performance here is sign of better things to come.As told by grandfather Peter Falk to his grandson, this ends up being a lesson to put down your video game and pick up a book, because sometimes as Belle in Beauty and the Beast would find, great adventures can take you into great places through paper, not a computer screen. I can just see the illustrations because this is a visual treat, and while at the time the whole narrative seemed unnecessary, it proves an important life lesson 25 years later.The handsome Cary Elwes plays the hero, her childhood love who has been unfortunately separated from her and now as a bandit, is all of a sudden reunited with her. But it's too late she is now engaged to marry the evil Prince Christopher Guest, Elwes' various obstacles to rescue her from kidnappers Wallace Shawn and Andre the Giant. Shawn is hysterically bad, not in his performance but in the way he keeps repeating the word inconceivable, making you laugh even more at this idiot of a character he is playing. When Elwes and Shawn go up against each other in a battle of the wits, you know this evil character's stupidity will be what ultimately destroys him, and the results are hysterical.Sometimes, however the film does go overboard, making buffoons out of various minor characters who are on screen so minimally that you wonder why the writers had them do the things that they do. Guest's elderly father, the king, is a senile old man who doesn't even hear Wright's pleas for help when she indicates that she is going to kill herself. All of a sudden when the minor character of a bishop comes on to marry Wright and Guest, his distracting stutter seems unnecessary and simply there to give juvenile audiences something to laugh at. In a sense it is cruel and ridiculous.However, a supporting performance by Mandy Patinkin as the revenge seeking swordsman who helps Elwes in his quest gives Pantinan a role to really sink his teeth into. He reminds me of the many dashing heroes at Errol Flynn had played years before, and this is a far cry from the types of roles Pantinkan had played on Broadway and on TV. There are some truly horrific moments too, scary enough for young children to be forewarned about, but for adults a reminder of the type of films that Ray Harryhausen used to make in the 1960s and 1970s. An encounter with a huge rat like creature truly is frightening! The film does have an old fashion style to it, making it a great pastiche in an error when such films as Excalibur, Willow, Legend and Ladyhawke took audiences into a world of fantasy that was sorely lacking in most motion pictures. Still attractive to look at, it merely suffers only because of the juvenile nature but has obtained a cult status that seems well deserved.",5,2,5,1 November 2015
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," It's obvious who's going to end up as a T-Rex toothpick from the very start.
","And you can put money on it and have a sure thing. This first follow-up to the 1993 smash hit is quite enjoyable, and you can see why Spielberg gave it the go ahead. Richard Attenborough returns briefly to tell Jeff Goldblum, the only lead returnee, that there's a secret island where dinosaurs are free to roam without people as snacks or as pebbles under their big feet. As the film opens, the audience witnesses a little girl ends up as a buffet for some dozen carnivorous puppy sized dino's, a creepy opening that really goes nowhere, showing some idle rich cruising the wrong island. Attenborough sends Goldblum there to gather photographic evidence where he runs into his estranged wife (Julianne Moore) who abandoned him and their adopted daughter (Vanessa Chester). The military breaks in with the intention of unleashing the dangerous dinosaurs on their enemies and this ends up with a T-Rex terrorizing San Diego!There's at least several evil humans whom the audience can't wait to see the T-Rex teeth up close, people so vile that the audience would often applaud as they felt their last moments alive vibrating the ground right in front of them. Moore and Goldblum are obviously the decent humans, fixing the broken leg of a baby T-Rex, and it's obvious that this won't be like the grateful lion who allowed the monkey to remove a thorn from its foot and didn't eat it.
When mommy arrives, it's obvious that she's not going to stop to ask questions even though Moore can tell that she isn't hungry, just lonely for baby. But what happens afterwards indicates that this mommy is as furious as the alien who terrorized Sigourney Weaver and every bit as determined to get revenge.Yes, this is just as filled with tension as the first film with several scenes putting Goldblum, Moore and the gymnastics trained Chester in peril. At times, the dialogue is silly and inappropriate, showing that sardonic humor doesn't always work. This does continue the graphic deaths of some characters, one literally torn in two before swallowed. Much deserving of a delicious death, Peter Stormare , gets pleasure from torturing the weakest of the dinosaurs and shows no compassion for those who become innocent victims. Then there's cameraman Richard Schiff whose arrogance at first makes him seem a perfect snack, but his heroism turns the table as fear takes over in his final moments. But the best crunch and munch is saved for the end as Pete Postlethwaite's leader of the exposition finds him trapped with both mother and baby and gives the audience a lot to cheer about.Moore finds out by accident that even the herbivore parents don't like their babies being messed with and nearly becomes the target for a swinging spiked tail. Don't underestimate the power of the small carnivorous dinosaurs because in large groups, their damage takes a longer time to lead to death than the big ones, and they are quite determined critters. Then there's the raptors, as bullying as ever, once again putting Moore in jeopardy, in a way that is quite funny. But their escape from the island isn't the end of the movie, and the sight of the T-Rex roaming the streets of San Diego is very funny as well. The fact that this entire neighborhood seems to sleep through the dino march is absurd. It's a great nail chewing ending however, and that makes this still a ton of fun.",7,0,0,4 February 2020
Behind The Candelabra," There is a sucker born every minute, and too many suckers crave a phony life.
","Living life like Norma Desmond did in the silent era, Liberace didn't have to wait until being a has-been who gets his young stud while still in the limelight. Michael Douglas gives one of his most memorable performances as the flamboyant piano impresario whose outlandish outfits, expensive jewelry and lovable 'Mr. showmanship' act couldn't prove to certain types of audience members that he was as gay as Yogi's picnic basket. The presence of bi- sexual Matt Damon in Liberace's audience creates a long-term relationship that will ultimately gets a ton of legal press, resulting in one of the first celebrity deaths from HIV.Would Damon's Scott be interested in Liberace if it was just Walter 'Lee' Liberace, that mid-western kid who played in saloons and ended up famous all over the world? That is up to the viewer to decide from this take on his life as told from Scott's angle. This gives an inside look into the life if an obvious unhappy man who is surrounded by obvious hanger on's, and if Damon really loves him, as is indicated here, it took Liberace missing a lot of frogs to find his prince. But princess Lee gets bored, and it's time to turn in his upright for a baby grand. By this time, Damon has become so used to the lavish lifestyle that giving it up is worse than going through drug withdrawal, although it is apparent that if he didn't initially love Liberace at first, he has grown to love him, or at least need him, by that point. Liberace, as played by Douglas, is queeney, charming, aggravating, self-centered, controlling, perverse and condescending. Damon falls reluctantly falls into the crazy world that Liberace pulls him into and the end of that universe is a human apocalypse from which retribution seems the only recourse. Seen briefly are Debbie Reynolds (unrecognizable as Liberace's mother), Dan Ackroyd as his arrogant agent and Broadway star Cheyenne Jackson as the prot√©g√© obviously filled with hatred towards Damon as he moves in while Jackson is pushed out. Rob Lowe is creepy as the plastic surgeon that takes over Damon's life and basically gets him hooked on all kinds of pills. Scott Bakula is authentic as the acquaintance of Liberace's who picks up Damon in the opening scene and remains his biggest confidante over the years. This gives a negative (but believable) look at the truth about certain stereotypes, over- played in the press to create all sorts of controversy at the height of the AIDS crisis.Yes, this is an expose on the unraveling of the public image of one of the great entertainers whose squeaky clean image was known by many and denied by his biggest fans, and how the manipulation of an allegedly innocent young man destroyed his life, ironically on Academy Awards night where Liberace performed the best score nominees. It's all scandal sheet documented, with the Liberace estate brought down with his private life being revealed throughout the hearing. Well acted and beautifully filmed, it's still a sad expose on how celebrity allegedly desires can destroy one's own soul. For the devoted Catholic Liberace, his claim that God gave him special dispensation to be gay is a sign of his self absorption and may be upsetting to conservative Christians who would probably avoid this movie anyway. Liberace's sexuality is shown in great detail, with visits to Silver Lake's Circus of Books (back in the day of back rooms and anonymous sex) while wearing his furs being quite sleezy indeed. Whatever the truth is won't diminish Liberace's legacy, but the fact remains that the world was fooled by Liberace's closeted life.",7,0,1,10 May 2016
Aladdin," Colorful combination of the original animated production and the Broadway hit that works except on two levels.
","For the remake of Disney's Aladdin, the filmmakers get pretty much everything right with the exception of the photography and one major piece of casting. Much of the photography resembles the Universal films made in the 1940's with Jon Halll, Sabu and Maria Montez, and for that reason in many places it is beautiful to look at on a nostalgic level . But as with many films of this type today, the editing and camera work is frenzied and often too fast-moving, and at times, the film becomes extremely blurry. This makes it difficult at times to pull up many of the major details and in some of the musical numbers, particularly the ensemble numbers, trying to capture every element of it becomes difficult.For example, in a friend like me, so much is happening that when you want to see everything, it begins to become difficult to do that and that makes it both frustrating and headache inducing. However, on the other hand, the Prince Ali production number is beautifully put together as if it were Elizabeth Taylor arriving in Rome as Cleopatra and every element of that is a 10 out of 10. For a whole new world, while it is said at night, much of the effects are set among photography that is too dark and certainly the lighting could have made it more profound.Casting wise, it took some doing but I found Mena Massoud charming as Aladdin and Naomi Scott appropriately feisty and strong as the independently minded Jasmine even though her actions would have had her imprisoned within the castle walls in real life. The evil Jafar, as played by Marwan Kenzari, has incredible magnetism, even sexier than Massoud, but he is lacking in the humor of Jonathan Freeman animated villain. Of course there is going to be a comparison of Will Smith to Robin Williams, and in avoiding doing so, I still found his performance to be bland and basically just phoned in. He has no sparkle and seems to be just there, only briefly coming to life such as the finale where Aladdin grants him a gracious final wish.There is so much to like here, but it is also too much of everything to try to capture in one viewing, and it really isn't worth the time or cash to go back to the theater to see it again. It might play better on video where the details aren't as huge. The opening scene makes it seem like you're about to see something out of pirates of the Caribbean, another Disney franchise, and ironically, part of the ending of this film made me think that they might try a sequel. Disney, please leave well enough alone and let sleeping Jafar lie.",5,0,3,10 June 2019
2012," A massive migraine of mass destruction.
","For about a third of this two and a half hour follow-up to 'The Day After Tomorrow', the audience must suffer through another soap opera plot, this time even more abrasively presented than its predecessor. It involves a divorced couple (John Cusack and Amanda Peet) trying to get their children to safety with the help of Peet's fianc√©e (Thomas McCarthy) when underground volcanoes begin to decimate L.A. and the rest of the world. They discover that the powerful leaders and the money men supporters have gotten together to build arks to save themselves from an oncoming flood. OK, fine premise so far, but there is so much silliness in the way that the plot is drawn, and especially with a powerful Russian businessman, his two Pugsly Addams like twin sons, his much younger mistress, and his personal pilot who's obviously having an affair with the mistress. McCarthy, after only a few flying lessons, is assigned as co-pilot, and already haven flown over Los Angeles where the ground is crumbling beneath them, he must now assist the head Russian pilot in flying this plane that is the size of three Concords. 'It's huge!', McCarthy exclaims, to which the Boris Badinoff sounding Russian tycoon simply responds, 'It's Russian.' If you can get through Woody Harrelson's embarrassing performance as a stoner who first alerts Cusack to the pending doom, then try not rolling your eyes at the sight of Cusack's car barreling down a Santa Monica, California street where the road literally is exploding directly behind them. Then, there's the shots them driving or flying through collapsing highways (Goodbye, 10 freeway!) and various large glass buildings, and while exciting to see, it just gets to be a bit too much. Even more cumbersome is the efforts for everybody to get on the outlandish ark, which on DVD is much easier to tolerate than it was in the movie theater, because there's always the fast-forward button on the remote.Of course, three years past the paranoia of the real 2012, this has been proved to be a total falsehood, a fright-making exploitation with mostly one dimensional characters and one-note performances that make this a collection of clich√©s and ultimately, in spite of some riveting moments, a true example of Hollywood bad taste. Danny Glover manages to make his character (President of the United States) totally likable, but Oliver Platt is truly obnoxious as a government hack. Certainly, this was fascinating in its initial big-screen run, but doesn't play well with repeat viewings. Also, after watching L.A. being wiped out by Tornados (through the same director), seeing the Pacific coast go through this again makes me wonder how the director would explain L.A. being re-built within less than a decade so it could only be destroyed again. Ironically, one of my old office buildings in Santa Monica is seen sinking into the Pacific, a big chunk of that coastal city being lifted off its axis and sliding down like the Titanic in the North Atlantic.

","History has proved that the old saying, 'God makes mad first whom he intends to destroy', and in the case of Nazi Ralph Fiennes in this Steven Spielberg masterpiece, that is oh, so true. Unfortunately, a lot of innocent people have to pay for that madness in the meanwhile, and that truly adds to the intensity of his madness as it increases and his vileness just gets more and more out of control.On the other end of the spectrum is Liam Neeson's Oscar Schindler, a businessman who knows by allowing the Nazis to take his Jewish workers away, his productivity will suffer. Selfish motives keep these innocent people from being sent to the death camps, and as Schindler learns the truth about the atrocities going on and becomes closer to the people who work very hard for him, he goes out of his way to keep the Nazis from going through with their evil plans.The atrocities you see here are things we can't fathom here in America. Innocent children are forced to hide in human waste to avoid discovery. An innocent woman prisoner with a background in architecture is brutally murdered after insisting that a building being constructed is doomed to collapse, after which the evil Fiennes simply orders his men to do what she suggested. Fiennes picks targets and guns them down, and also has Schindler's aged workers killed simply because he considers them too old to contribute. An innocent young girl in a red coat (the only color in this black and white movie) wanders around Warsaw as the ghetto is destroyed. Neeson almost looses his right-hand man (a magnificent Ben Kingsley) because of a paperwork mix-up. This culminates in the most daring of escapes from Nazi persecution, and that is where Neeson realizes the full effect of what's going on, breaking down in a scene that will have you shivering in your seat.I can't watch these movies without the temptation to scream at the Nazis on screen. Even in the most outlandish propaganda films of the war era, I tended to either applaud loudly or scream in delight 'Die, Nazi, Die!' as the villain gets their come-uppance, either through brutal murder or the firing squad after a lengthy trial revealed their shame. Many of those times, my body was shaking so violently as sobs emerged from me that I was unaware I was capable of. You can't call these feelings manipulation by the direction; Spielberg obviously felt a passion for the story he was telling, as if he knows that this can cross over into any race, any culture, any religion.Rarely in recent movie history has it been so obvious when a film was released that it would sweep the Academy Awards, and 'Schindler's List' truly deserved every honor which it received. Some stories are so painful that you can't go back and watch them easily; I find that every so often, I need a movie like 'Schindler's List' to remind me of how vile humanity can be, and how one compassionate human being can change the course of history for so many. The finale with real-life 'Schindler Jews' honoring their hero is truly awe inspiring and is certainly what you can call triumph over tragedy.",10,11,15,29 August 2014
The Lion King," I didn't think they could do this as 'live action', but they did, somewhat.
","A perfect remake? No way, by no stretch. But enjoyable and filled with heart? Yes. Despite the absence of three beautiful songs from the Broadway musical ('They Live in You', 'Shadowland', 'Endless Night'), this was a satisfactory update of the Disney film, a variation of several historical stories, including Jacob and Joseph from the bible and Shakespeare's 'Hamlet'. The legendary James Earl Jones is recognizable through his eloquent voice the moment he speaks as the Lion King Mufasa, only showing slight age in his rendition of the character 25 years after voicing the part in the original. JD McCrary (young Simba) and Donald Glover (older Simba) are great as the bereaved prince who believes wrongly that he was responsible for his father's sudden death, and Chiwetel Ejiofor is very subtle in his villainy as Scar, the usurper king.How can you recapture the magic of the Broadway show, especially that moving, tear jerking opening of 'The Circle of Life'. The one difference is between the animated movie, this remake and the Broadway show is the ability to show all of the various animals throughout as opposed to the limited view of the elephants, zebras, giraffes and other exotic creatures in the Broadway show. 'Circle of Life' shows every creature in nature coming to pay respect to Musafa's presentation of his new son, picked up and carried to the edge of the rock by the noble baboon Rafiki who has the magic ability to know royal blood when he feels the warmth of it on his fur and skin. Simba's friendship with Nala is explored, but their mistakes come back to haunt them, leading Simba on his own to make an even bigger mistake that gives the opportunistic Scar to take advantage of the situation. Beyonce, as Nala, seems underused, only really getting to sing briefly.I never got the point of the songs 'The Morning Report' or 'Hakuna Matata' (which I have always referred to as 'Potato/Potatoe'), and the inclusion of wart hog Pumbaa and meer cat Timba in 'Can You Feel the Love Tonight?' is a juvenile, intrusive way to start one of the most beautiful love songs ever written for a Disney musical. In the Broadway musical, they make me cringe a bit, and in this remake, with the live action (or computer animation), I felt that feeling once again. Still, the movie is beautiful to look at, and there are some definite tension filmed scenes that will keep you gripped. The large number of bad reviews is very surprising as compared to the passionate positive reviews, and while I think this could have been made with more care (another 10-15 minutes to include the cut songs would have been nice), it is a satisfactory, if not unflawed, movie musical.",6,0,0,14 October 2019
Amadeus," Taking classical music to the level of pop.
","Insanity has taken over the envious Salieri, the aged former musical adviser to the Emperor of Austria, and that leads the Ben Franklin look-alike into slicing his throat, claiming that he is being haunted by the ghost of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart whom he claims to have murdered. F. Murray Abraham gives a brilliant portrayal of a brilliant man who let his own insecurities drive him into hating the gifted composer who became a legend in death while his own legacy was pretty much dissolved thanks to Mozart's rise to immortality.The life of Mozart (the wonderful Tom Hulce), as seen through Salieri's eyes, is one of 'why is this crude man so talented while I can't even get my own operas revived?' In his lifetime, Mozart was praised yet had difficulties sustaining his livelihood, but Salieri had great financial success. Even that didn't appease him, so what does one artist do to another to ensure that they don't succeed? Drive them to death, of course! In a plot twist straight out of the classic Gothic horror, Salieri disguises himself in an evil looking masked cape which Mozart's own deceased father had worn, and hires Mozart to write a requiem. The twist of Salieri's scheme? He intends to take claim for writing the requiem-for Mozart's own funeral! On the surface, Salieri is not an evil man. He's actually pretty decent all around, but when this young upstart comes into the midst of the royal court he works in, Salieri and the other members of Emperor Joseph's court are livid. The madness takes over when Mozart has an affair with the star of his Turkish opera whom Salieri loved. On the opening night, Mozart's engagement to another young lady (Elizabeth Berridge) is announced, which upsets diva Christine Ebersole and alerts Salieri to their affair. Pretending to be Mozart's only friend in the court, Salieri becomes amazed, impressed and even touched as he watches him work. But the evil of envy is a stronger emotion and this leads to the deed that threatens to destroy Salieri's soul.Eccentric Mozart is presented here as a sort of punk rock Mozart, seeing something in opera besides fat women chewing up the scenery with their sometimes shrill voices. Indeed, his operas are very touching, and are staged with the opulence of the most magnificent musical theater. These shows are fully staged musical dramas which happen to be totally sung through, making the old fashioned style of opera seem totally pretentious. His operas like 'The Marriage of Figaro', 'Don Giovanni' and 'The Magic Flute' are all lavish fantasies or tragedies, and are brilliantly recreated here with the Academy of St Martin in The Fields. Mozart didn't just appeal to the royals or aristocracy, but the gallery as well, poor people who desperately wanted escape. Escape is what you get here, especially with a shot of some genuine Vienese pastries. Elegant, funny, sad, touching and profound, this adaption of the hit Broadway play is probably the most deserving Best Picture Oscar Winner of the past 40 years. Even at over 2 1/2 hours long, it moves at a fast pace, taking the viewer into a visual eyefest of what life during the pre-days of the French Revolution was like in Europe. In fact, King Joseph (Jeffrey Jones) happened to be Marie Antoniette's brother, and mentions briefly the issues going on with the French people. Poor Mozart isn't some obnoxious show-off fool; He's given many different dimensions that make him truly likable and interesting. Salieri isn't a one dimensional villain, either. His motivations are totally identifiable even if his actions aren't. Not bad for a stage actor whose most remembered film role prior to this was as an effeminate gay bath house customer in 'The Ritz'.",10,0,1,17 December 2014
Ghostbusters," Who you gonna call? The one and only ghostbusters...no remake necessary.
","Poor New York Public Library. The big famous Schwartzman building on 42nd Street and Fifth Avenue has been plagued by floods, mutants living in the bowels underneath the city and gang members of the future, not to mention in real life, the oldest book on the world, snooty librarians and over diligent security guards. But long before it became a sanctuary from the eye of the storm in 'The Day After Tomorrow', it was the home of some really spooky ghosts, maybe not living inside one of the lions like Ted Ross in 'The Wiz', but present none the less. A huge blockbuster when first released, it was a triumph for 'Saturday Night Live' veterans Bill Murray and Dan Ackroyd, along with Harold Ramis and Ernie Hudson as the team of spook hunters, Sigourney Weaver as their first client, Rick Moranis as her pesky next door neighbor, and Annie Potts as their wisecracking Eve Arden like secretary. Weaver gets a glamorous role that is a total contrast to her character in 'Alien', utilizing sly and subtle comedy as she deals with trained comics who obviously showed her a thing or two.While everyone is great, Murray is the major scene stealer, and it's easy to see why for a while, he was one of the most sought after actors in films. ' He slimed me' couldn't be funnier coming from anybody else. Ackroyd does a variety of his familiar Saturday Night Live characterizations, but Murray has a way of delivering lines that has a greater impact. Ramis, a funny guy in his own right, plays the role completely straight, but it's insinuated that something's going on between him and the cynical Potts.Along with that bouncy title song and vintage New York location shots, there are some terrific special effects and some amusing references to social trends of the time. Back in 1984, if you weren't entering Indiana Jones' temple of doom or warning Zach Galligan about 'Bright light, bright light', you were shoutin' 'I ain't afraid of no ghost!' A sequel wasn't horrible, but a recent ripoff of the original was justifiably criticized. This was original in every way, and no modern update could improve on that.

Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Sequels don't fool audiences.
","It's all about the cash, and for the long running 'Pirates of the Caribbean' franchise, it's time to retire it. That doesn't seem likely however based on Johnny Depp's last line in this latest entry, trimmed to just over 2 hours yet feeling every bit the 2 1/2 listed as the running time. The premise seems great, although enough back story has been provided in earlier films that explained much of the character's histories.Depp is so comfortable in this part that he could do it sleepwalking. He's just as charming and foppish as ever, best when making comical asides about the ridiculousness going on rather than simply being on the outside of the plot looking in. Yes, he's established as being the subject of revenge by several characters, but the real story involves Jack's old enemy Captain Barbarosa (a much subtler Geoffrey Rush) and the vengeance seeking Captain Salazar (a heavily made-up Javier Badhem who has several agendas and is determined to reach his goals no matter who he has to kill to get there.There's the underlying story of a young man out to end the curse put on his doomed ghostly father (trapped at the bottom of the sea) and a young lady of science accused of being a witch. Of course, this leads to a romantic relationship, obvious from the time he has to hold onto her behind for a long period of time as she struggles to get out of a noose. At the same time, Depp's doing somersaults with a faulty guillotine and ends up with a wooden sword proof vest. Funny, yes. Relevant to the plot, no.This holds the attention with bemused eye rolling for 3/4 of the film, but goes way overboard in a watery abyss where all enemies come together and all secrets come out. The special effects are impressive, often noisy, but after a while, the absurdities just get to be too much. Some Ray Harruhsusen type creatures briefly get some attention (ghostly sharks, the ship's hood ornaments come to life), but it's just more of the same, rushed out for box office gold without regards to script, substance or all around interesting characters.",4,10,19,10 June 2017
Patton," Sometimes, ego does make the man.
","Sometimes in life, a human being may have unlikable qualities, yet still be extremely likable in spite of all that. George C. Scott and General George Patton shared both of those qualities, so how ironic to have them associated together through this Oscar Winning Best Film. This is one time in watching a movie where it does help to know a little something not only about the character the leading man is playing, but the leading man himself. With his raspy voice, not quite leading man physical looks and a controversial off-screen image, George C. Scott is a most fascinating actor because in spite of everything, you can't help but like him. In playing one of America's most controversial World War II figures, Scott gave a solid performance that is captivating even when he is being less than kind to the people who are serving under him.Even if he just appeared in a short covering the opening sequence (the classic speech in front of the giant American flag), Scott would have entered screen immortality. But there's another three hours after that amazing sequence (which screenwriter Francis Ford Coppola claims almost got him fired off this project), and that is three hours of solid entertainment. Any man who can use the Lord's name in vain while professing his belief in God is a fascinating character to watch, whether you agree with how he feels or not. When Scott attacks a soldier on the verge of a nervous breakdown in front of the wounded in the hospital, you sense both his compassion (for the wounded) and the reasons for his anger at the soldier he humiliates.This isn't a war epic about amazing battle scenes, although the strategies that Patton reveals are very interesting. When Scott is off screen, you will be riveted to the sequences where Nazi officers reveal aspects of Patton they have discovered themselves to their amusement. The relationship between Patton and British war hero Douglas Montgomery is also fascinating, a battle of two Prima Dona's who know they want glory, although Patton adds that he's willing to admit it, even if Montgomery (a subject of several war films himself) isn't.Karl Malden offers solid support as Patton's right hand man, perhaps the only man who truly understands him and accepts him for who he is. The ending reminded me of the final scene between Humphrey Bogart and Claude Rains in 'Casablanca'.",10,2,3,5 November 2012
Lincoln," Always question why a 'free' nation had slaves.
","The civil war, the issues of slavery in America and the life of Abraham Lincoln have been told many times, through books, plays and movies, and I say, 'Keep writing the books and plays, and keep making the films. Remind the world forever that freedom is the only way to allow the world to rotate around the sun, that man's inhumanity to others will not be tolerated, and that corruption in the government should be vanquished the moment it is discovered. For this story of the last year in the presidency of Abraham Lincoln (Daniel Day Lewis in his third Oscar winning role), the fight to get the 13th amendment passed is covered.Supporting Lewis in a very true to life visual is Sally Field as first lady Mary Todd Lincoln, as strong and determined as her husband, even as she deals with several family crisis while her husband works himself nonstop to bring the war to an end as long as slavery is abolished. Tommy Lee Jones gives a mesmerizing performance as Lincoln's main rival, with a wise performance by Hal Holbrook as Blair, Lincoln's main adviser. Having played Lincoln a number of times himself, his participation is a great tie-in together.Lewis is never anything but Lincoln in this film, determined with every depths of his soul to achieve his goals. His humanity, humor, self depreciating view of his looks and seemingly clumsy manner are apparent throughout. Lincoln has serious discussions with black soldiers, fighting for the north, paid servants in the white house, and ensues upon his offspring the very ideals that both got him elected and divided a nation in the first place. But as he finds supporters of freedom, that doesn't mean that these people are for the blacks being considered equal, obviously wanting to keep them 'dumb' and 'voteless' like women.Technically brilliant, this is basically a simple plotted story of a great man, focusing on events and issues in an episodic manner. Some important historical characters are either just mentioned or seen briefly, and I wonder if this could have been made with more detail at even three and a half hours and be just as good as this version. An important film, it is the crowning achievement of director Steven Spielberg's later years, as important and socially significant as 'Schindler's List'.",9,4,6,11 April 2017
Caddyshack," A tribute to the late Lois Kibbee (Mrs. Smalls)
","Lois Kibbee plays the relatively minor role of Mrs. Smalls, the snooty yet amusing wife of Judge Smalls (Ted Knight).  A veteran of several roles of society matrons on daytime soaps during the 70's and 80's, Kibbee had her only film role in this popular snobs vs. the slobs comedy which, second to 'National Lampoon's Animal House', remains a testament of the style of comedy during the Jimmy Carter era.Best known as the lovable and somewhat mellowed Geraldine Whitney Saxon on 'The Edge of Night', for which she received several Emmy Nominations, Kibbee took time off from that role to make this film, where she first appears in the restraunt scene with no dialogue, but a similar Geraldine look of shock that sets the standard for her character.  Of course, her character is reacting to the pass made to her by the obnoxious Rodney Dangerfield. Later, Kibbee has two key scenes of slapstick where her character domineeringly tries to get the caddys out of the country club pool and notices an object in the pool which sends the whole club into panic; The scene flashes forward and while Kibbee watches, SNL veteran Bill Murray comes in for one of the funniest pay-off scenes in film history and Kibbee's reaction is priceless.  If there were Oscars for cameos, Kibbee would have been a shoe-in for this role.Her next group of scenes surround the christening of a yacht where young Michael O'Keefe flirts with her over the amused objections of her hubby, Ted Knight; Once again, Kibbee gives the perfect reaction shot as her attempt to christen the yacht fails.  This is followed by Knight and Kibbee's return to their lavish home where O'Keefe and loose Cindy Morgan (as their niece) are about to perform the dirty deed.  Knight and O'Keefe get into it while Kibbee is taking a shower.  A shower-capped Kibbee peaks out as O'Keefe runs by in his underwear.  Her reaction of joyous surprise is another one of the subtle hysterical moments of the film, yet after this she only appears as an extra in the show's final scene.  'Edge of Night' fans who adored her as the formerly snobby Geraldine (based loosely originally on Rose Kennedy) were delighted by the comical way she was presented here, and later 'One Life to Live' fans were gifted by her dramatic gifts as the evil matriarch Elizabeth Sanders.  The world of show business lost one of their true treasures in 1993 when Kibbee, who also wrote for 'The Edge of Night' (and briefly 'Capitol'), passed away from a brain tumor.I suggest catching this film to see an amazing performance of an actress who could say more with her eyes than most do with words, than catching her on 'The World of Soap Themes' website where an episode of 'One Life to Live' features her in a different type of role.  Hopefully, SoapNet will eventually show re-runs of 'The Edge of Night' where she played an older lady with the heart and love of life of a 20 year old who not only was beloved by every character on the show but by practically the entire audience as well.",7,0,0,14 August 2003
Jurassic World," The park is finally opened, and I'm not mad about the monster.
","I believe that going to the movies has become a chore, not only because of the cost or the lack of enjoyable subject matter, but simply because if I get a headache at home watching a movie with extremely loud sound like this, it's easier to grab an aspirin. 'Jurassic World' takes the franchise that Steven Spielberg created more than twenty years ago way too far, showing how ridiculous computer-generated effects have become, and taking away the simplicity that once made going to the movies fun. It has been almost 15 years since the previous 'Jurassic Park' movie, and what was fun in the first two, rather tedious in the third, has now gone completely over the top, bloody and often aggravating. When dinosaurs start to become clich√©d, it's time to move onto other themes.The park that Richard Attenborough dreamed of opening in the original has come to reality, lead to its success by idiot scientists who demand that the dinosaurs are bigger: in size, in teeth and most importantly, in appetite. Shots of the herbivores do bring a sense of peace as the human visitors to the park intermingle with them as if they were simply walking through a cow pasture. But, as cinematically breathtaking as this appears to be, it doesn't change the fact that it has basically learned nothing from the first three films, and messing with perfection at least with the first film is obvious.All the more obviously pathetic in this film is the formula for inclusion of children, visiting the park to meet with their career obsessed aunt, the leading scientist who has no idea how to mingled with human beings let alone children, even her own relatives. She is a very unlikable character, surrounded by a plethora of fools and as scientific as the dialogue is made out to be, it is obviously just pretentious, making for a film where it seems that the dinosaur's eyes should be rolling along with the audiences.Hollywood really needs to get a grip on its unoriginal and obvious greedy obsession with guaranteed box office draws that show little artistic flair. The tension is at its highest when dozens of pterodactyls attack one of the park's common areas. Yes, there are some tender moments here that quiet it down temporarily (such as the caring of the sick brontosaurus), but this just shows me that movie producers today aren't really trying to move onto original ideas and are simply taking the easy way out.",4,2,10,30 April 2016
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Pure imagination taken to the extremes.
","Who else but Johnny Depp could capture the magic of the character of Willy Wonka? Playing the character more childlike then Gene Wilder, he lacks Wilder's sarcastic asides, being more the broken little boy trying to find the list dreams of his childhood . Tim Burton's variation of the Ronald Dahl children's tale is perhaps darker and closer to the original from what I have read, but it is missing some of the innocence and fun of the 1971 musical. The musical numbers here, with the Willy Wonka theme, are rather annoying after a while. The film is incredibly fun to look at, but the four nasty kids are ten times as obnoxious as the originals, although Veruca Salt is pretty close in brattiness. The Oompa Loompas aren't as mysterious as the original ones, and after a while, they remind me of a few of the ensemble numbers from the original movie version of 'The Wiz'. This is obviously more about style than substance, and while the original had some strong moral lessons attached, this one weakly presents one perfect little kid with a feisty grandfather whose past at the Wonka factory is a nice tie between him and his local community. But, there seems to be some filler added, with Christopher Lee added as a Vincent Price cameo and a strange reference to a Buddhist temple made out of 100% milk chocolate that obviously melts in the first heat.Helena Bonham Carter has little to work with as Charlie's mother. Freddie High more seems too perfect for Charlie, lacking the wide- eyed innocence of Peter Istrum. David Kelly is missing the old vaudeville style spark that made Jack Albertson so brilliant. Depp could charm the almond out of the Hershey's kiss and not melt the chocolate, but some of Tim Burton's work seems to be rushed without regards to the structure. Depp's hairstyle and costuming are a variation of a Bette Davis drag queen (with a Marilyn Monroe voice attached), and at other times, he appeared to be channeling Annie Lennox. Impressive sets, odd costumes and bizarre make-up and hair styles don't mean bupkus if you ain't got a sensible script. The edible park set was gorgeous, and the boat scene on a giant gummy bear was frightening. Watching Violet turn into a giant berry was fun, as was seeing nasty Veruca being attacked by squirrels. The character of Augustus Glupp is just absolutely disgustingly presented, as is his porker of a house frau. At least in this one, the kids are glimpsed leaving the factory, but it doesn't appear that they are any the wiser. Hopefully, their parents are. It's a decent attempt to modernize the look if the classic style, but all is not creamy and milky in this chocolate bar.",5,0,1,8 May 2016
Big Fish," There's no fool like an old fool with pure imagination.
","Oh to have a father like Albert Finney, the tall tale teller who has been annoying son Billy Crudup with all of these bigger than life stories ever since he was a kid. But as it nears the end of his final story, his son must come to terms with his reluctance to embrace these alleged myths, and sets out to view his father's life. It is an adventurous life seen through both the older Finney and his younger self, Ewan MacGregor. Tall tales, yes, but by the time this is over, you may be feeling as gullible as I did, embracing it whole-heartedly and sobbing as if it were the ending of 'Steel Magnolias'.Finney, already a tall tale legend whether playing Tom Jones, Ebenezer Scrooge or Daddy Warbucks, has a wonderful heart-felt role here, much like Gloria Stuart in 'Titanic' or Dabbs Greer in 'The Green Mile', and he is the perfect grandfather you'd love to adopt. Jessica Lange adds class as his not so long suffering wife who has accepted his foolishness and loves him all the more for it. Tim Burton regular Helena Bonham Carter adds chills as a woman of mystery. I first discovered this approximately two and a half years ago when I saw the short-lived musical on Broadway. It is a shame that it only lasted a couple of months, but at the time while moderately enchanted, I didn't catch the magic that I would later discover when listening to the original Broadway cast album. Seeing the movie finally has only touched me all the more on this story, and while the film isn't perfect, it is one I feel that could not have been totally captured with all the color and light of the movie when it was transferred to the stage. However, if it was a great usage of daffodils, the favorite flower of the leading characters major love interests, and all the magical characters of the film meticulously presented. This included a witch, a big-hearted giant and a mermaid. Broadway has taken these types of stories into its hard, and while they are not the huge success of 'Wicked', shows like this, 'Finding Neverland' and 'Tuck Everlasting' will most likely have cult following in years to come. the movie itself is gorgeous to look at, featuring the type of magical story that only Tim Burton can do perfectly, and with a Danny Elfman score that with 'Edward Scissorhands' is among his best. Cinematically, it is breathtaking and is one I will definitely revisit over and over.",8,0,0,25 April 2016
Singin' in the Rain," The hero gets the girl, the sidekick and the dumb blonde get the awards....
","When 'Singin' in the Rain' won praises in 1952 for its salute to the beginning of the Hollywood sound era, the critics praised everybody involved with the film, from producer Arthur Freed and director Stanley Donen, all the way down to minor characters Madge Blake as a Louella Parsons like gossip columnist and Kathleen Freeman as a diction coach. Gene Kelly was praised for his graceful dancing even more so than the classic musicals he had already starred in, and Debbie Reynolds was saluted as a promising new leading lady who was perky enough to rise to the top yet established enough to hold her own with the veteran leading man. Ironically, it was Kelly's pal Donald O'Connor who went home with a Golden Globe, and Jean Hagen as a dizzy movie star whose voice killed her transition from silents to sound who received an Oscar Nomination.Now referred to as one of the best movie musicals ever made (certainly in the top 10), this has been re-done for the Broadway and London stage (with mixed results) and imitated through spoofs on T.V. variety shows and in various modern movie musicals. Even 'Xanadou', a 1980 cult flop which was Gene Kelly's last musical film role, made a reference to this in one of their musical numbers. But it is this movie which stands the test of time and retains its place of glory in the movie musical hall of fame. Of course, Kelly's performance of the title song remains its most famous moment, but how can you not be amazed by the 'Broadway Ballet' production number which features a gorgeous Cyd Charisse as a silent movie vamp. Future 'West Side Story' Oscar Winner Rita Moreno is instantly recognizable as a Clara Bow like cutie, and Millard Mitchell is imperious yet comical as the perplexed studio head.This was released at a precarious time in MGM's history, just as the transition from Louis B. Mayer to Dore Schary was taking place behind the scenes. Television was taking off, too, and movie audiences had to be really intrigued to skip Lucy, Uncle Miltie or Red Skelton to go to the movies. Reviews across the board were fantastic, and to this day, people can still quote Hagen's nails-down-a-chalkboard lines such as 'What's wrong with the way I talk?' and of course, 'Ta te tee to too.' There's a fabulous montage saluting the early years of talkie musicals, and if you see some of the rare ones released between 1929 and 1931, you can appreciate the detail which went into the creation of this number.O'Connor really steals the scene when he breaks into 'Make Em' Laugh' which almost sounds like Cole Porter's 'Be a Clown' from 'The Pirate' which ironically was originated by Gene. Debbie gets her chance to show her dancing skills when she joins O'Connor and Kelly for 'Good Morning' which has been utilized for orange juice commercials recently. O'Connor and Kelly prove that graceful dancing can be comic in Kelly's montage over his transition from vaudeville hopeful to flickers wannabe to matin√É¬©e idol ('With dignity. Always dignity', he repeats as flashbacks show otherwise) and 'Moses Supposes'.While there were no musical superstars at MGM during the early age of sound (Broadway veteran Charles King comes closest thanks to 'Broadway Melody of 1929' and a few other forgotten musical antiquities), other studios had teams and individual stars who come close to representing whom Kelly, O'Connor and Reynolds play here. As for Hagen, there were a ton of forgotten silent stars whom she could be, but even if fictional, the reference to what was the major problem is hilarious, as is the revenge Kelly and O'Connor get on her in the conclusion and the discovery of Reynolds as a major musical talent.",10,0,1,21 August 2014
Alice in Wonderland," It it live, or is it Burton-ex?
","The trouble with many of the spectaculars today is that you can't tell if the actors are real, made up to look freakish, or some cartoon with just a voice attached. Modern computer generated special effects were a novelty when they were first making these, but now it's an attraction that often seems closer to 'Ice Age' than real live action. Subtle use of this form of special effects made many of Tim Burton's earlier works, but I had a hard time really becoming engaged in this 'Alice in Wonderland', feeling I had fallen into the rabbit hole myself and o.d.'d on a dinosaur size order of magic mushrooms.With many famous faces (obviously many of them Burton regulars), this is going to be artistically beautiful to look at, but difficult to become totally engaged with. First of all, you've got an overaged Alice (Mia Wasikowska) who seems like a college student playing dress up, a slam towards Lewis J. Carroll's conception of the lost little girl.The performances of the characters of wonderland are basically extended cameos. Helena Bonham Carter tries for camp and ends up a screeching shrew whose Stewie Griffin like head I wanted to see explode. Johnny Depp, for once, seems to be just an amalgamation of every Burton character he's played, not a bad thing, but basically a performance that he basically texts in. It's nice to look at like a fancy drawing at a museum but after five minutes, it's time to move on.",4,1,2,22 March 2017
The Mummy Returns," Was one enough? Probably, but this is still worth your time.
","OK, since I've already watched 'The Mummy', I might as well carry on with its sequel, especially since much of the main cast (lead by Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz) have returned, and the first one was so much fun. How bad can it be? Well, bad is in the eye of the beholder, and this is extremely enjoyable for what it is in spite of the fact that like most fantasy action films of the past 20 years, it can be just TOO much. Even though this came out before the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' franchise, it has some of the elements that made later entries in that series far too complicated even with its simplicity. Convoluted, often confusing, mainly because there's far too much going on, far too many characters, far too much action to get in one sitting, and with hundreds of thousands of movies to watch, who wants to go back and see something again that they didn't get the first time. OK, me, but that's when I need a break from fresh celluloid.Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson dominates the first reel of this film as the Scorpion King, an Egyptian warrior who, while on the verge of death, offered himself up to one of the Gods of darkness in exchange for more time to conquer his enemies. That he gets, with the sudden appearance of a tropical paradise in the middle of the desert, and then he's off to battle with the aide of demonic looking monsters aiding him. But when his time is up, it's up, and he's pulled away to fulfill his promise. Centuries go by, and the scorpion bracelet ends up on the arm of Fraser and Weisz's son, and that could open up a great big can of flesh eating beetles and once again destroy the world. The only way to conquer the Scorpion King is to bring back Imhotep, last seen being pulled into the muck after his eternity was pulled out by mysterious beings on a white chariot.This probably plays better on a digital TV than it did in the theater because by the sounds of things, it is extremely loud, and I like to be in control of the height of my movie watching volume. This takes everything that was good about 'The Mummy' and practically quadruples it. That makes it fun in spots, too much to really collect in your movie going memory in most places, yet always keeping your attention. At least there is a story there, and the continuity from the first film to this hasn't been greatly sacrificed outside the return of Imhotep. If you can get past the absurdities, you'll have a good time, but my mind's eye tells me that I'll have to give this another shot again in about five years to catch what I missed the first two times around.",6,0,0,7 July 2020
Avatar," As stunning as it looks and as riveting as it is, it's been done before.
","I've been badgered to see this film for years, and when I finally do, I come out of it fairly impressed, but something tells me that this plot line is a tale as old as time. Another case of 'Uh oh, there goes the neighborhood'. The dreaded earthling, apparently already having destroyed their own planet, settles on what appears to be the moon of a huge planet called Pandora, and decides to take over. The best way to interact with the residents of this colorful planet is something called an avatar, or fake body in which the soul of an earthling is suddenly put into the avatar, a proxy of what the residents of this place looks like. The avatars interact with the residents, feel everything they do, but when the day is over and the human soul wakes up, the avatar simply passes out as their soul has been removed. Then a ruthless marine commander decides that the residents of this planet need to move from where they are, and the scientist (Sigourney Weaver) running the avatar program objects, leading her and a crippled marine (Sam Worthington) to steal one of the marines' aircraft to warn the natives and prevent the nasty Stephen Lang, the colonel who has no regards for the residents, the native American like Na'vi, turning this into a modern science fiction version of many classic westerns.This takes time to build, but once Worthington is in his avatar body, the action really takes off, especially after he meets Na'vi princess Zoe Saldana. The strong Saldana, seeing Worthington as a 'baby', educates him after her parents, the clan and spiritual leaders of the tribe, insist that he is now one of them. Of course, Saldana already has an admirer, promised as her mate, and this sets up potential rivalry. But as Lang's anger towards the betrayal of Weaver, Worthington and the few who followed them out grows, so does the violence, and it's up to this small group of avatars to warn the tribe to get out before its too late, because the power of Lang's weapons of mass destruction knows no barriers. As I am not a huge fan of modern CGI or the loud special effects that have overtaken modern cinema, I have avoided many films like this over the past decade, but on home video, find you can easily control the volume rather than be blasted by theater speakers. I instantly recognized the plot structure from many films over the years, but was impressed by the colorful photography and human way the natives were presented, instantly correlating it with real earth native American tribes, so often abused and misunderstood in Hollywood movies. The script is indeed better than I expected, and I was grabbed emotionally nearly from the start. Like other blockbuster franchises, I suspect that future entries in this film series will not nearly be as powerfully ingrained on my memory, and I hope that the time is taken to write great stories with great scripts that won't rely on old tricks and thus become a pale imitation of this film which for future generations should be seen on a large screen to get the full impact, something I missed.",7,0,1,10 October 2017
The Artist," At last...Somebody Gets It!
","Somebody cares. Somebody understands. We need art. We need movies that move us, not send us to the devil. That's what TV talk shows are for. 'The Artiste' is a fantasy come true for those of us tired of devil possession movies, too many computer generated special effects and horrendous acting by amateurs who think that film stardom is an adequate replacement for therapy. What this gem of celluloid is can be best described as payback for the audiences who have stayed away until a movie came along with them in mind: a Mondt in a museum full of stick figurines. Silent movies were not meant to dominate the screen for eternity, yet this film is more than about that. It is a combination of familiar stories, most obviously 'Singing in the Rain' and 'A Star is Born'.It was also a movie about the refusal to change with the times. Sometimes it is necessary, yet sometimes it comes with a price. Hollywood was young, if far from innocent, but its goals certainly were simpler. Make a buck, entertain and enlighten, but don't upset the censors. This film reminds us of simpler values, like helping others, which the silent film actor does for the future movie musical star who will be there for him when he hits his inevitable decline. The silent and early talkies are lovingly re-created, and the clunky dancing (and sets) in the finale are right out of 'Broadway Melody'.",10,3,5,11 October 2012
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," When the setting steals the show, you know it's a missed opportunity.
","While this has some very entertaining moments, this is really an unnecessary sequel to the first installment of one biggest box office hits of the 1990's. In retrospective, even the first film doesn't hold up nearly 30 years later, being rather violent and cartoonish featuring a family I certainly would not want to be any part of. While this time indeed, the Macaulay Culkin character of Kevin does make it on to the plane, it's the wrong one and he ends up in the wrong City. While his family ends up being stuck in the hotel because of constant rain in Florida, Kevin makes it to sunny Manhattan where once again he encounters the nasty Crooks played by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern. Christmas in New York is said to be magical, and it's up to Culkin to find ways of passing the time while his mother, Catherine O'Hara, strives to get there so she can find her son home she is frantic of having lost for the second time over the Christmas season.The characters play by Stern and Pesci have outworn their welcome, and this time the violence tossed at them by Culkin in an abandoned family home seems to be twice as ruthless, not that they don't deserve it. But in reality, there is no way anybody could survive any of the self defense ploys that Culkin throws at them, so that aspect of the plot line becomes quite eye-rolling as it goes far too over-the-top.That means that the film is best when it deals with the colorful characters of New York, particularly Brenda Fricker as a Central Park bird lady, Eddie Bracken as a kindly toy store owner and Tim Curry and Dana Ivey as imperious front desk clerks at the Plaza Hotel. What does become equally as irritating as Stern and Pesci is Kevin's family, especially his obnoxious older brother who creates a major disturbance at a Christmas concert Kevin has a solo in that in defending himself, Kevin causes the entire presentation to fall apart. Shots of New York around the holidays bring on a feeling of nostalgia, especially with many businesses which are no longer around as well as a nice shot of the Twin Towers less than a decade before they were destroyed. A cameo by a certain overrated celebrity turned politician is fortunately extremely fast and other than a quick 'eew' at the side of them is only a minor disturbance. In true Hollywood fashion, this was not the end of the saga, but the last one in my opinion worth bothering with. I used to rank this as much higher in rating, but other than a few sweet moments, including a thoughtful one involving a pair of turtle dove tree decorations, it does not hold up as well as it did on my first viewing when it first opened in theaters.",5,1,4,23 December 2018
Groundhog Day," If I had to live my life over again, where would I like to be stuck?
","Of course, for cynical weather man it's Punksatawnee Pennsylvania, and for him, it's a nightmare until he decides to have fun with it, taking his anger and hatred out on everyone he encounters, and that includes the groundhog. But destiny has him there for a reason, and until he figures it out, he's stuck there, reliving each day. He seduces a lonely, beautiful woman, goes on a drunken rampage and robs a bank truck. But by picking up little tidbits of people's lives here and there, he begins to see them with eyes open, eventually without the cynicism. Even behind the mask of happiness is often a tale of sadness, and each of these characters has a story worth hearing and worth empathizing with.In 'Caddyshack', he dealt with a gopher, but an even bigger rodent is his unintentional nemesis, and like the perfect team, they've got each other, babe...over and over and over... Will his sweet assistant producer Andie McDowall fall prey to his charms during the repeated unofficial holiday, and what will it takes to wake him IP? Broadway audiences are currently storming the August Wilson Theater to see this unfold as a musical, but to many others, this is a cult film, a philosophical question of the values of life, and arguably, Bill Murray's greatest performance.For big city folk who consider the thought of spending a long time in a small town to be a reason to throw up, it might open their eyes to the ideals of a simpler, slower Norman Rockwell like life. Murray discovers what's deep inside him, finding that what he thought himself and others to be is totally incorrect. McDowall is sweet, desirable, yet no man's patsy. Most of the rest of the cast seem as if they stepped outside of small town U.S.A., although having spent the first part of my life in a small town, saw the truth that there's a variety of characters in all types of communities. So grab a ride to Puncatawnee P.A., grab a partner and clap to the Pennsylvania polka. Maybe this movie will change your life too.",8,0,2,11 May 2017
Beauty and the Beast," Disney gets it right with a tiny little twist that got extreme conservatives in a twist.
","There are plenty of changes in the movie version of the Broadway version of the hit animated classic, the first animated film to be nominated for an Oscar. It's a colorful blend of live action and computer generated effects where everything seems alive as opposed to painted. Belle is played by the attractive, if not typical a Hollywood beauty (Emma Watson), certainly no pushover for the obnoxious Gaston (Luke Evans). When her eccentric father (Kevin Kline) ends up under the clutches of beast Dan Stevens, Belle offers herself in place of him. His beastliness must vanish, and that falls to Belle to guide him to change, not because he simply has to in order to reverse a curse, but because he wants to out of love for a good woman.This jumps off the screen from the start, far less pretentious and over the top as similar fantasy tales that dominate the screen a bit too much. Each character is believable, and the modern twist concerning Josh Gad's LeFou, subtle in its insinuations, but scandalous because of press headlines drawing both praises and boo's. While some of the new songs for Broadway have been dropped in favor of new songs (giving new songs Oscar potential), all the favorites of the original movie are there, staged brilliantly as if they were flying off the stage of the Palace or the Ambassador, its Broadway homes.The household staff, turned into household items which reflect their personality, are a highlight with a delightfully warm Emma Thompson as Mrs. Potts, Ewan MacGregor as Lumiere, Ian McKellan as Cogsworth and Audra McDonald as Madame Garderobe. 'Be Our Guest' is lusciously staged, and I wiped my eyes quite a bit, both in the beauty and the beast's twin soliloquies and the title song. While I loved and missed the beast's song from the Broadway version cut from the show, the replacement is equally as moving. This should create an instant classic that I hope gets past the controversy and becomes a major smash.",10,11,26,25 March 2017
Some Like It Hot," Many have tried but few have succeeded in coming close to matching it.
","There are four Oscar worthy performances in this Billy Wilder comedy classic. Marilyn, Jack, Tony and Joe all shine in the beaches of Florida where sweet Sue and her band, featuring luscious Miss Monroe and two real dogs perform in an all female band. The problem is that the dogs aren't real women: they're musicians hiding from the mob, having witnessed a St. Valentine's Day massacre style hit. Mob head George Raft wants them dead, so what's the best way to hide? Dress up as a woman of course!Drag goes back to the silent era in cinema, so the concept is far from new, but the writing, directing, black and white photography all come together with excellent editing that perfects the timing of all the gags. Joe E. Brown, who had done his share of drag in film, takes a shine to jack Lemmon here, getting some great moments and the tag line that has become a classic, much like Marie Dressler's final quip in 'Dinner at Eight'.It is considered an Oscar sin that Marilyn Monroe did not get a nomination for this part. 'Jello on springs!', Jack Lemon comments, but it's the Cary Grant like portrayal of Tony Curtis the gets her attention, making her think that he owns the huge yacht that really belongs to Brown.So many great moments, from Monroe's two big songs to Lemmon and Brown's tango. It later became a hit Broadway musical (practically forgotten today), but nothing can diminish the perfection of this film, one for the ages. Without it, I doubt we'd have ' Victor/Victoria', 'La Cage Aux Folles' or 'Priscilla, Queen of the Desert'.",10,1,1,17 February 2017
Les Mis√©rables," Finally-a Broadway epic musical that has not been filmed as a missed opportunity!
","It is ironic that the light-hearted Broadway musicals filmed for the big screen over the past 15 years have been the bigger hits: 'Chicago', 'Hairspray', 'Mamma Mia!', while 'Evita', 'The Phantom of the Opera', 'Rent' and 'Nine' have been considered misfires. (I myself am a fan of the 'Evita' film; The others, I'll save for another review.) Frankly, I was getting sick of 'Les Miz', having seen it on stage numerous times as well as PBS Documentaries, Concerts, and clips of it on tributes to its producer. But, with the film version of it finally out (first spoken about by Cameron MacIntosh on the documentary 'Les Miserables: Stage By Stage' back in the early 1990's) finally out, I am thrilled to say that this movie version of the epic stage musical is even more thrilling on screen than it was for me on stage, at least the second or third time around.To see all of these characters and their various traumas fleshed out for the computer generated era of big screen effects has made it all the more real for me. Unlike the more light-hearted musical comedies, 'Les Miz' is a show that cries out to be done on screen in a big way. And from the moment you see the men doomed to basic slavery as prisoners pulling a huge ship out during a hurricane to the exact music that they sang in misery on stage, you know this isn't going to be like your visit to your local legitimate theatre or even to Broadway where it played for almost 20 years. To top this off, the movie version of this Broadway epic has been perfectly cast with its leading man, Hugh Jackman, playing the role of thief Jean Val Jean sentenced for stealing a loaf of bread.There has been much talk about the way Russell Crowe has played the role of Javert, which on stage, was played as if he was Captain Bligh of 'Mutiny on the Bounty'. Considering that Charles Laughton played both Javert and Captain Bligh in 1935, it isn't surprising that people expect him to be crueler. Less severe looking than previous incarnations, Crowe's performance is actually a bit scarier because he does not incarnate the obvious dominating performance of Laughton or Robert Newton (from the 1952 version) or the actors I saw portray him on stage. His singing isn't as strong as the others (he seems to sing more through his nose than his lungs), but who expects a villain to sing like Mario Lanza or even Nelson Eddy? His singing is adequate, and his performance adds a different dimension, especially his heartfelt reaction to the death of a character as the film winds down.Anne Hathaway steals your heart as Fantine, and with so many people having brought 'I Dreamed a Dream' into people's hearts, she does an incredible contribution by truly owning it as this character on screen. Amanda Seyfried is a sweet Cosette, while Isabelle Allen as the young Cosette truly looks like the drawing on the show's logo. Qudos too to Samantha Barks for her sympathetic Eponine who plays the character exactly as I remember her from stage. 'Sweeney Todd' movie vets Sasha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter are a perfect couple as the nefariously comic Thenardier's. I always thought that Madame Thenardier was a French version of Mrs. Lovett anyway. Eddie Redmayne adds a nice impish quality to Marius, while Aaron Tveit's Enjrolas is a powerful presence as well.I was concerned as to how some of the musicals would be done, and I was not disappointed; I always hope that 'One Day More' would be filmed much like 'Quintet' ('Tonight') was for 'West Side Story', and was thrilled to find out that it was. I had hoped Javert's 'Stars' would be filmed with his head as the moon in the background as Val Jean and Cosette traveled over the years, but was delighted with how they did it. Javert's final scene is truly haunting, and many of the horrors of these characters truly had my mouth wide open in shock, especially the scene of Val Jean and Marius in the sewers and the final shot of Crowe as Javert. The final is truly touching, a sort of 'Titanic' ending that really brought tears to my eyes. This is definitely worth a visit to the big screen, and do make sure you have Kleenex.",10,7,14,9 January 2013
Titanic," One of many movies and many stories from the ship of dreams, but still floats at the top of the list.
","From 'Cavalcade' in 1933 to 'Titanic' in 1953, 'A Night to Remember' in 1957 and 'The Unsinkable Molly Brown' in 1964, the doom ship Titanic became a voyage of legendary, if tragic, proportions, and in the time leading up to its 85th year spawned a TV movie, a Broadway musical and this masterpiece which had audiences preparing to get tickets for it even before it was finished shooting. The reason is clear: James Cameron, Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio, the promise of effects like you'd never seen in any movie, and a Celine Dion song sung over the teaser trailer that would shoot her to super-stardom.This is told in flashback through the experiences of the 102 year old survivor Rose Calvert (veteran 1930's movie actress Gloria Stuart, nearly forgotten until cast in this), shocked to see a drawing of herself in pristine condition. The nude drawing of her as a young woman wearing a valuable diamond is found in a safe pulled from the ancient wreckage and she immediately notifies the explorers who are searching for more Titanic artifacts and stories. Arriving with pretty much every single belonging of hers as well as her doting granddaughter, Stuart winces in tears with a sudden memory, but insists on going on with her story.From there, we are swept back decades to the luxurious ship on its maiden and only voyage, and the huge vessel is grandly detailed and scaled as only an epic of this nature can scale it to be. Winslet is engaged to the vain Billy Zane, forced by her desperate mother (Frances Fisher) to tolerate him because they are broke and only have their 'name' to benefit them. Fisher, obviously having married 'up' , is ultra snobby to the neuvo riche Kathy Bates, and when she meets Jack Dawson (DiCaprio), she knows trouble lies ahead, and her demeanor is enough iceberg for any young lady. Dawson has saved young Roe from committing suicide in the icy waters below, and their first encounter turns into a love that you know can only end tragically.With real life Titanic passengers Brown, John Jacob Astor and his wife Madeline (which would be a great subject for a separate movie), Benjamin Guggenheim and Isadore and Ida Strauss (another subject that would be a touching film), this mixes in these real life characters with the fictional ones. Zane and his humorless right hand man (David Warner) are great villains, with Zane absolutely vile as he psychotically tries to maintain his stolen dignity when he loses his trophy wife to be to a commoner. Watching Zane go psychotic as he stoops to the depths of evil makes you wish he wouldn't make it off, but the writers have an even better plan for him.The film takes well over 90 minutes before the disaster sequences start, and from then on, it is a dizzying, sometimes headache inducing bit of tense moments as DiCaprio, locked to a metal pole to drowned for daring to love Winslet, struggles to be set free. It goes on a bit too long, but for first time viewers is truly frightening. There were buckets of tears being flowed at the Paramount Studios theater I saw this in prior to the release, and even after half a dozen or so viewings, it can still bring them on.Certainly this is filled with cliches, but they are the type of cliches that have worked since the days of the silent movies. This was probably the first film since 'Gone With the Wind' to be considered a guaranteed Oscar winner, sweeping a good majority of them when it came out. In many ways,, this has very old fashioned ideals and is thus an old fashioned style movie, one of the last of its kind that still worked ('The Artist' from 20 years later was a rare exception.) I can watch this once a year and still be emotionally turned to mush by it. That is what makes an instant classic.",10,1,1,30 June 2020
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Hogwarts or hogwash?
","While not a reader of the books, I take this series as pure escapism, total fantasy and not a promotion extolling the virtues of witchcraft. In fact, I think it does just the opposite, showing how dangerous it is to flirt with the dark arts, that life is better left to chance, and that while spells and incantations might seem an easy way to get what one desires, those methods aren't generally realistic. The first episode of the long movie series gets every detail letter perfect and Making an astonishing debut as this character, Daniel Radcliffe shines like a young Jackie Coogan in 'The Kid', Jackie Cooper in 'Skippy' and Mickey Rooney in anything before 1940. He had already appeared with Maggie Smith in a BBC version of 'David Copperfield', so their reuniting for this was blessed with magic for the second time. Along with head wizard Richard Harris and Hogwarts groundsman Robbie Coltrane, Smith must hide the baby Harry, dropping him off with mentally abusive aunt and uncle Fiona Shaw and Richard Griffiths who baby their obnoxious son while mistreating Harry and keeping vital letters from him concerning his destiny. Once Harry gets to Hogwarts, it's worse for him when he finds his name already known and instant enemies because of that. But there's instant friendship with the brilliant but cocky Hermione (Emma Watson) and the awkward Ron (Rupert Grint) who become involved in Harry's adventures, fighting against ugly trolls, jealous students and the very mysterious Alan Rickman who seems to be as evil as he looks. But greater evil exists in the form of the mysterious Voldemort, rumored to be responsible for the brutal murder of Harry's parents. This was the start of many adventures and capers that Harry and his gang would become involved with, some more outlandish than the others. While the young leads were obviously the focus of attention for the target audience of teenagers, more mature audiences can sit back and enjoy the adults. If Agnes Moorehead was once accused of playing a witch like a nun and a nun like a witch, Maggie Smith played both those characters as if she was a great lady of British noble birth. Richard Harris makes Dumbledore a brother like character to 'Camelot's' Merlin. The snake like Ruckman is delightfully slow speaking to add mystery.Technically, this is fascinating, whether it be the students entry into Victoria Station's track at 9 3/4, the soccer like game Harry becomes a key player in, and of course, the chess match finale. As far as modern day fantasies go, this is tops, although some of the series can't compare with the first. Other modern series on film of similar nature owe their start to this entry in the 'Harry Potter' series.",9,0,0,27 September 2017
It's a Wonderful Life," Each man's life touches so many others.
","In looking at this glorious Christmas classic, it's easy to get so involved in the psychology behind it. we obviously become so caught up in our own lives that we often forget about how others around us have influenced who we become and vice versa. This film, which has been redone in many different forms, including taking popular characters from TV shows, both daytime and nighttime and putting them in the same situation as Jimmy Stewart, truly stands the test of time. Not only is it watching one man's slow destruction from things that seem to be beyond his control, it's seeing how one person can deal with the ruthless machinations of the pure evil around him and open the eyes of everybody else to see what's really going on.In a return to the Christmas theme that he earlier used in 1941 classic 'Meet John Doe', director Frank Capra saves the seasonal Twist of the story for the film's last half-hour. An unseen angel is sent to a small town to aid a possible suicide victim when the actions of the greedy and evil Lionel Barrymore threatens to send him to prison for embezzlement. Stewart's life is seen in flashbacks for much of the film, but when the film joins the present day, it is almost like it has gone some 70 years into the future to today with Barrymore representing the truly evil Scrooge like banker who wants to control everybody's life.It is quite a shocker to see Barrymore playing such a nasty, evil man after playing the kindly Dr. Gillespie in the series of MGM medical dramas. he is basically expanding the role of Scrooge which he did on radio for many years and adds an essence of true malevolence to his characterization. Even Scrooge wasn't as crass as his character here. It seems to be a continuation of the role that Edward Arnold played so beautifully in Capra's earlier films 'Mr Smith Goes to Washington' and 'Meet John Doe'.The lovely Donna Reed crosses over from MGM ingenue to classy leading lady, adding much depth to her role of Stewart's girlfriend, later wife, with Beulah Bondi saintly as usual his lovable mother. (Bondi played Stewart's mother in so many films and on TV that it is obvious that somehow in real life, he did call her ma.) Then there's Gloria Grahame as the town flirt, Thomas Mitchell as Stewart's rascal uncle, and of course Henry Travers as Clarence, the angel who desperately wants his wings. The smaller roles are filled out by many familiar actors, some of whom were in pretty much every Capra film, as well as Danny Mummert and Larry Simms, both from the 'Blondie' series and Karolyn Grimes, an underrated child star who stole many movie programmers in the mid-1940s.There are so many other things to credit for this film's excellence beyond the cast and direction, namely the brilliant script, fast pacing and brilliant production design. This film holds up regardless of whether you see it in its original black-and-white form or it's decently restored colorized version. I'm not in favor of colorizing classic movies, but somehow this one actually came out all right. while I watch this one every other year rather than every year, I can say that I am continuously touched and discover new seems in its that I had not seen before. It is no wonder that this is on nearlt everybody's list of the top Christmas movies of all time.",10,4,6,25 December 2018
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Always something evil sprouting up at Hogwart's.
","Even a piece of children's fiction like the 'Harry Potter' series can stir up controversy over the themes it deals with. Stories of witches and magic and supernatural powers and beings have cluttered literature since the days of Greek mythology, and people simply looked at it either as the remains of an ancient culture, a piece of art from a creative mind or a reminder of the many worlds out there which we know nothing about. In reading claims that the 'Harry Potter' books and films open up the minds of children to magic, black or white and is a Pied Piper journey towards evil, I had to remind myself that as far as I can see, it's only a piece of fiction, that children have wild imaginations, and that as long as they are made aware that it is indeed, pure fiction, no evil can come from reading books or watching the films. If there are hidden messages there, they are way hidden beneath the theme that evil is always destroyed by good, that monsters of all sorts are conquered, and that children can be influenced to help others in times of crisis, something everybody in life needs to be prepared for.Having spent a miserable summer at home with his aunt, uncle and awful cousin, Harry Potter is rescued by his old pals and returns to Hogwarts for his second year in spite the attempts of an elf to prevent him from going back. It seems he's in some sort of danger, and as he gets settled back in school, strange occurrences start to unfold. Students who are not of full magical backgrounds (think of Samantha and Darren's kids in this category if they were Harry Potter characters...) end up 'petrified' (frozen), and even Harry ends up with a boneless arm thanks to an inept professor (an over- the-top Kenneth Branaugh, mugging delightfully) who fixes his broken arm after a game but removes the bone. Rumors of a monster of extreme power (enough to 'petrify' the students if they only get a glimpse of its reflection) take over the school, scaring even the local cave spiders which at one point trap Harry and Ron in the forbidden woods. Warning: If you are at all arachnaphobic, proceed with caution; The spider sequence is quite gruesome. The monster, too, is quite a sight, straight out of those 1950's and 60's Ray Harryhausen adventure films that hold up quite well today.The film goes into detail as to the past of the school, and it becomes clear how loyalties were formed, how the evil dark wizards came about, and why certain characters are the way they are. The presence of Malfoy's father gives a great indication as to why he is the way he is, but there's certainly no sympathy added for him, as he still looks like he could give Rhoda from 'The Bad Seed' and Damien from 'The Omen' films a run for their evil money. Richard Harris and Maggie Smith continue in their showy but quiet loyalty for Potter and his band of friends, and there's the presence of a ghostly student whose fate is revealed and seems tragic in spite of some annoying qualities she has. Emma Watson, as Hermoine, is off screen for a bit as she is one of the petrified students, so there is a break from her know-it-all attitude which sometimes put me on the side of Malfoy when they would go up against each other.For me, the first two of the series were the best, and from then on, they were of very mixed qualities as the special effects and CGI went way over the top at times as did some of the newer characters and plot elements which drove the series to its conclusion. I watch these films simply for the magical elements that take the viewer away to a world that doesn't exist, or one that at least those in tuned with a different type of spirit world can block from intruding into their lives. The quality of the veteran actors here is another attraction, and rising stars with true talent make it nice to see the next generation at their beginning. To see this series as anything other than a children's dream as seen through the eyes of an adult becomes pointless.",7,1,1,11 October 2017
Rosemary's Baby," Yes, Sir, that's Satan's Baby....
","When a movie opens with Mia Farrow singing 'La la la la' over the credits to spooky music, you know it's going to be a strange film, and with 'Rosemary's Baby', not only did she become a star, but the supernatural Satan worship film craze began. Yes, there were movies about devil worshipers before, but they were usually Z-grade low budget films that had little commercial release other than drive-ins and underground theaters. 'Rosemary's Baby' was a mainstream film produced by the king of shock schlock (William Castle) and directed by the controversial Roman Polanski.Finding the perfect apartment in Manhattan has been tough in any decade, but in the 1960's, it proved to be demonistic for young housewife Farrow whose out of work actor husband (John Cassavettes) literally makes a deal with the devil to insure his success. Once you find a perfect apartment in Manhattan, you also hope for perfect neighbors, ones who are friendly and helpful without being nosy. 'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner!' Katherine Hepburn says in a Turner Movie Classics montage of 100 years of film, which is immediately followed by a shot of a peephole focusing on the obviously eccentric Ruth Gordon. Minnie Castevet is one of those neighbors one dreads but can't help but not like. She's a little too helpful, always a bit too cheery, and a lot interfering, if well-meaning. But there is obviously something up with her and husband Roman (Sidney Blackmer), and it will come to a horrific discovery for Farrow, especially after a nightmare that leads to her becoming pregnant.Ira Levin's best-selling novel was one of 1968's most popular movies and made a cult movie star out of the elf-like Farrow who is unlike any other movie star before or since. Even with all those classic Woody Allen films of the mid-late 1980's, this will be the film for which she will always be remembered. She's just slightly neurotic enough to be compared to the boy who cried wolf, which in this case would make her the wife who cried Satan! Nobody's going to believe that the nightmare she had was actually reality, that is except an old friend (Maurice Evans, ironically the warlock Maurice on 'Bewitched') who finds out that his interference isn't without consequences.On the side of Satan are such memorable character performers as Patsy Kelly, Hope Summers, Elisha Cook Jr., and Phil Leeds. Kelly is hysterically funny as Gordon's pal as they arrive at Farrow's apartment and start knitting up a storm for the unborn toddler. Later, she rocks the cradle as if she was churning butter, making her distaste towards Farrow obvious and childlike. The film is mostly serious, especially as Farrow meets and befriends young Victoria Vetri who meets a shocking ending. This alerts her to the dangers awaiting her, especially when she meets Gordon and Blackmer upon returning home to find a crowd in front of the apartment building on Central Park West. The suspense grows and grows, exploding into spooky consequences as Farrow tries to escape her fate. The film is guaranteed to keep the audience riveted, and the ending leaves the viewer's imagination open as to what would happen, although a rarely seen television sequel would take the story down stranger paths.",8,1,2,21 October 2014
Jersey Boys," We're your dream boys.....
","Mr. Emotion himself, Clint Eastwood, the dude who learned about screen love at the hands of Carol Channing and sung his way into the hearts of dozens in 'Paint Your Wagon', has joined an elite group. William Wyler, Sidney Lumet, John Huston and Richard Attenborough were all brilliant directors who tried their hands at helming a musical, and of the five, only William Wyler (with 'Funny Girl') was successful. The remainder of them all had critical disappointments and even disasters with their efforts, and Eastwood is the latest. If his film version of 'Jersey Boys' isn't a disaster, it certainly ranks as a missed opportunity.Perfect in period detail, this is proof that not all Broadway smash hits can be transferred to the screen. Seen around the world after becoming a smash hit during the time when juke box musicals were frequently bombing, this was the musical for straight men who didn't want good and bad witches or big haired housewives from Baltimore. It's 'The Sopranos' meets 'American Bandstand', and that's a large target audience. In its 10th year on Broadway, it still packs em' in although not at full price anymore. The movie has a tele-feature feeling about it, and something tells me that this could have made a great T.V. mini-series with all the music intact rather than abbreviated as it is here.This isn't as much a musical film rather than a showbiz drama with musical interludes. The story of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons is older than 'Grease' (the movie title sing introduced by Valli himself), and John Lloyd Young seems to be filled with Valli's young spirit. The typical rise to success story is 'Dream girls' with three of 'West Side Story's' surviving Jets getting outta da hood and into the big time. Had this been introduced to film rather than stage, it might have gotten a better reception, but purists were mildly disappointed even though there are some wonderful moments.Where this is successful is in its use of nostalgia, and that's what raises its impact for me. Eastwood wisely choose brassy colors to represent the era, and as the story develops, the color photography takes on a life of its own, almost becoming the fifth season. The gimmick of certain characters narrating directly to the camera is a bit off putting. For me, it is a valentine to a by-gone era that continues to create new fans among young audiences who get to see that the older generations were not as square as they seemed.",6,1,1,27 May 2016
When Harry Met Sally...," A classic romantic comedy with a semi modern twist.
","Can men and women be friends without sexual tension? Well, let me rephrase. Can straight men and straight women be friends without sexual tension? That's what the screenplay of this modern classic asks, pre cell phone era, where relationships of the friendship and romantic kind depended on people having conversations without a gadget in their hand. People had to take the time to really get to know each other, and often, relationships of the romantic kind started off as relationships of the friendship kind. This is two old pros of romantic comedy at their best, although it is obvious that Billy Crystal is simply playing Billy Crystal, not that that's a bad thing.Meeting as travel partners, Crystal and Meg Ryan do not quite hit it off. Although their initial meeting is less than stellar, they don't soon forget each other. Five years go by before they see each other again, and then another few. The third meeting is the charm as what she initially saw him as a freak has turned into something more concrete. It's friendship, not romance however, and being inseparable, certain emotions take over, twisting their initial thoughts about each other into something completely different. As he insisted that women and men can't simply be just friends, will she be proved wrong, or will the romantic bug not bite?Charming and simple, this features some very funny moments and a fantastic supporting cast. Famous for the fake orgasm sequence featuring director Rob Reiner's mother Estelle, this has some allegedly real couples off the street describing their own romantic pasts. Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby offer sage advice hysterically as the best friends, while Michelle Nicastro (the very first 'Les Miserables') plays Ryan's pal involved in a non ending liplock with Crystal in the opening scene, followed by soap hunk Steven Ford missing Ryan at the beginning of Ryan and Crystal's second meeting. Harley Kozak, rising up from soap heroine to film actress, has a brief appearance as Crystal's ex-wife. (Between these three and soap vet Ryan, this had a bit of soap power in its often comic soapy storyline). While Ryan obviously is not a singer (quite rancid actually singing a showtune), she is funny, and next to Tom Hanks, Crystal is her best on screen partner.",7,2,2,3 April 2017
Burlesque," Will we believe in life after Cher?
","Will we be strong enough and be able to turn back time to remember a time without the ageless diva who made it big, not only in music, but on television, on Broadway (in a play, not a musical) and in movies? Yes, Cher is not as active in movies as she was when she shot to the legend of cinema goddesses winning an Oscar for 'Moonstruck', but her legendary status has not diminished with age. When I talk with people from age 15-85, they all say one person embellishes it all in the world of entertainment, and that is Cher. You can praise Barbra, Liza, Ms. Ross, the Divine Ms. M, Madonna, etc., and I adore (most) of these ladies. But there is only one who touches each generation, every race and nationality without reluctance.Now that I've gushed, I must confess that I went into this movie with mixed feelings, and I came out of it a bit surprised. No, this is no classic, and I can honestly say that in my 25 years of living in Los Angeles, there is no club on the Sunset Strip that represents the club that Cher owns here. The club is more Crenshaw Blvd. than Sunset Blvd., the strip loaded with its expensive restaurants, comedy clubs, rock clubs and strip joints (mostly towards downtown). This is more valley than city, but like 'Connie and Carla', another favorite of mine, I look beyond its misrepresentation of what it shows L.A. to be.Christine Aguilera really surprised me by what a natural actress she is- likable, not at all annoying, and someone you root for. She is Ruby Keeler of '42nd Street' in leather and lace, with Cher the Warner Baxter putting on the show and Kristen Bell a younger version of Bebe Daniels, the star who is always late (and usually drunk). Cher tells her to go ahead and 'Spend the rest of your life pouring vodka on your Cherrios'. She is also the den mother to the girls, reminding Bell of how many nights she held her head over the toilet so the poor girl wouldn't drowned in her own vomit. When Cher breaks into 'Welcome to Burlesque', I cringe at the thought that this multi-talented woman has never stepped foot onto the Broadway stage into a musical, and it took this standard story (beefed up for modern times) to allow her to sing in a movie. Any flagging Broadway show would be lucky to rush her into the cast so she could strut herself. Cher in 'Mamma Mia' as Donna, anyone? I found Aguilera's persistence at getting a job at the bar so amusing, her gall both perplexing and pleasing to the deep-down gold-hearted Cher who is so afraid of loosing her club that her distraction by the younger girl ultimately wins her over. Eric Dane, as the bartender who befriends Aguilera and takes her in may seem to some to be like a Chelsea boy than the sweet heterosexual man he plays, but I think that had more to do with his bartender costuming and the overabundance of showing off his body than anything else. Peter Gallagher, Stanley Tucci and Cam Gigandet give fine supporting performances, but I wanted to see much more of Alan Cumming as the door man with more than just a passing resemblance to his 'Cabaret' emcee. The Golden Globe Winning 'You Haven't Seen the Last of Me' is Cher's big 11:00 number, and may not have the greatest lyrics, but in the way Cher performs it, the result is unforgettable.I've heard people call this the L.A. 'Show Girls' and an updated 'Valley of the Dolls', but it actually offers some intelligence, especially with its denouncement that does what a musical is supposed to do-be triumphant.",5,0,1,20 November 2012
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Stunningly different with an occasional element of silliness that prevents the film from total excellence.
","The legend of Vlad the Impaler (Gary Oldman) has taken over the Dracula legend through books and documentaries, and the premise of this movie has added an interest to the real-life historical character who once fought on the side of the Catholic Church in a manner so evil and brutal that the vampire legend sprang out of his existence. Here, he is fighting the Turks for the church, impaling them on sticks, although the film cuts out the visual of him dining while surrounded by the bodies, some of whom were still alive and in agony as they lingered up in the air gasping their last breaths. The suicide of his fianc√©e (Winona Ryder) upon falsely learning of his death makes the church damn her, and he in turn, damns the church. He's turned instantly into a blood-drinking demon who will rise up from death after sending a sword into a cross, and all of a sudden, 500 years later, looks like a combination of Benjamin Franklin and the aging Salieri from 'Amadeus', albeit with a very bad hair style.When Keanu Reeves, as a British attorney, makes plans to head to the Carpathian Mountains to meet an aging count (actually you-know-who), he bids a sweet farewell to his worried fianc√©e (also Winona Ryder), and after heading through the spookiest looking mountain range, ends up in the company of this aging ghoul. Oldman continues to play the part, taking every ounce of it seriously, which makes it easier to forgive the laughable wig he is wearing. (Mel Brooks would playfully spoof that with Leslie Nielsen as the Count in 'Dracula: Dead and Loving It'; A Broadway musical version which was a huge flop also kept it in. Go figure.) Odd things happen, especially with the Count's three wives who seem to be literally connected at the hip in one scene, and a gruesome gift for them from the count himself may upset some viewers. Between Oldman's wig and Reeves' over the top attempt at serious acting, this sequence is both intriguing and sometimes too silly to be believed, especially a shot of Oldman literally shooting up straight as he comes out of a coffin.When Dracula finally arrives in London, he's taken on a third look, and here, he's a dashing aristocrat who can walk about during the day without fear of the sun. This has upset some 'Dracula' connoisseurs, but for plot purposes, it works, at least in this version. The chemistry between Oldman and Ryder as they connect in some sort of time travel re-meeting is undeniable. But a vampire is a vampire is a vampire, and with ethics or not, the blood lust means evil, and evil must be destroyed. That brings in Anthony Hopkins as Van Helsing, sort of silly at first, but never imbecilic. Sadie Frost is a delightful flirt as Ryder's pal Lucy, but that wedding dress that she must wear seems more appropriate for some gay priest drag ball.Overall, however, this is a satisfying update of the story, and you certainly feel that they've captured each era of the story wonderfully. As directed by Francis Ford Coppola, this is one of the first modern films with this high definition look, and the photographers went overtime to get everything just perfect. Shadows of Dracula moving in other directions than the actual character on screen make an unforgettable visual, and as Dracula is able to turn himself into whatever image he likes (including a werewolf at one point), makes his legend more intriguing. A tense finale has everybody back in the Carpathian Mountains and is followed by a beautiful Annie Lennox song that wraps everything up neatly. While not perfect by any means, it is still a film I can watch over and over again, finding new elements in it which I missed in previous viewings. If only the lack of subtleties in this had been a lesson to learn and had influenced Coppola in his very busy 'Mary Shelley's Frankenstein' remake, that film wouldn't have been as disappointing. You can't repeat the same formula twice and necessarily succeed.",9,0,3,1 December 2013
The Mission," If this ever comes to a revival house near you, run as fast as you can to see it!
","This is the story of atonement, the story of forgiveness, and the story of how new faith takes more drastic steps than the old faith. While it is difficult to believe Robert De Niro as a Spanish warrior, it comes to be easy as his transformation occurs. In the opening scene, he's catching natives of South America and turning them into slaves. He comes upon the Jesuit mission run by Jeremy Irons and makes it clear that he sees these natives as animals meant to serve the 'civilized' European than be taught about Christianity. A sudden turn of events involving younger brother Aidan Quinn and his lover, Cheri Lunghi, turns De Niro into a shell of himself, and thanks to the head of the Jesuit ministry, he ends up right back where he started, in the South American jungles, aiding Irons in creating the mission. But his old cohorts become his enemies, determined to destroy the mission and make more profits with new slaves.While Irons' missionary is a peaceful man, more prepared to die than fight, conflict soon erupts between the methods of the two men now on the same side. A young Liam Neeson plays another one of the missionaries, finding that he has a combination of both men's beliefs, and in the end, they fight two wars with their enemies: the spiritual war of God where death brings honor, and the violent war of man, where the point becomes to fight regardless of the outcome and to exhaust the enemy in a world that they aren't completely prepared for. Of course, there's gorgeous jungle photography where in the opening, the natives actually send a missionary to his death, floating over a huge waterfall on a cross. It's with the power of peace through a pure soul and simple musical cords that Irons managed to get through, and that musical theme is one that will sing in your heart long after the film is over.While some of the casting made me cringe, particularly of a few of the enemies, I found that De Niro and irons really became their characters. De Niro's breakdown after a climb up a huge mountain range is extremely emotional, and as he is forgiven by the natives who obviously recognize him (but were lucky enough to escape), more emotions take over. The children, especially, are enchanting, and you'll not soon forget the one with the infectious laugh. The children become just as heroic as the adults, and if you are like me, you'll jeer at the fat obnoxious slave trader who refers to a singing native child as a trained monkey. When he keeps refusing to allow the missionaries to speak by his constant braying of 'Your eminence!', I wanted to stand up in the middle of the movie theater and demand that he shut up. This is a film that will make you look at the evils of racism and slavery, and condemn the perpetrators to hell, unlike Irons, who obviously had the ability to forgive even under the most vile of circumstances.",10,1,1,9 March 2017
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," The third time did not leave a charmed life.
","Less is more, and there was plenty of that in the tightly made first two Hobbit movies, as good as any of the well planned Lord of the rings series. I realized within the first half hour that the series should have concluded with the end of Smaug, moving this third series into outlandish and convoluted messiness after the second film's fist wrenching cliff hanger was resolved within 20 minutes of this film. Suddenly, there's a bunch of new threats to keep Thorin from taking back his mountain as humans, elves, dwarfs and Smaug's evil ogres fight. In the meantime, I began fighting a huge headache, and I blame the over ambition for this entry for giving it to me.Certainly, the idea of the end of one battle leading to others is promising drama, having been evidenced in real history. But none of what transpires here is in 'The Hobbit' in my memory of having read it at least three times. This shows as much desperation in the desire to continue the franchise that has turned 'The Pirates of the Caribbean' series into an abysmal joke.Characters that you rooted for in the first two films are pretty much destroyed here, and the voice of Smaug continues to pop up, not only to haunt Bilbo Baggins but to voice villainous characters as well. The lack of loyalty to the original novel is very apparent, turning this into an obnoxious clich√© of different levels of magic represented for both good and evil. Films like this take away my confidence in the modern Hollywood method of making movies, and reminds me why I avoid movie theaters now for the most part. They say that too much of a good thing can damage a final product, and this is evidence of how true that is.",3,3,4,5 September 2017
Ben-Hur," If there was ever a movie deserving of annual big screen release, this is it!
","Don't allow the long running time scare you off and prevent you from watching this glorious epic. It is as sensational now as it was over 60 years ago, and completely stands the test of time. This glorious heart felt story will grip you from the very beginning and keep you going through the profound ending that involves the greatest man who ever walked the face of our Earth. Subtitled as 'A Tale of the Christ', this is the saga of Hebrew royal Judah Ben Hur who suffers much in order to find his way back to God, and indeed, he encounters the man known as Christ. Judah finds betrayal from his childhood best friend (Stephen Boyd), ends up a galley slave on a ship that burns up when suddenly attacked, is set free by the captain (Jack Hawkins) he saves, and finds himself facing a violent death when he ends up in a chariot race with Boyd, set on killing him. Tragedy involving his mother (Martha Scott) and sister (Cathy O'Donnell) adds more stress, but one last encounter with the stranger Jesus opens up the possibility for his true salvation.There are more than just a few coincidences between this and Heston's previous biblical epic, 'The Ten Commandments'. both more powerful remakes of silent films, and both featured Martha Scott as Heston's mother. They both feature Heston being betrayed by someone he's known all his life and banished, returning to settle the score in a way that isn't filled with vengeance. Heston does have a grudge to hold against Boyd, and he plays out the transition of Heston's goals as the plot changes angles in making Heston 100% whole. Like the later 'Greatest Story Ever Told', Heston encounters Jesus, but unlike his over-the-top performance as John the Baptist, Judah Ben Hur is played with subtlety, sincerity and grace, and there's a sense of humbleness that was missing in later Heston performances.Jesus isn't the only historical figure to appear, as there are also spots briefly for Pontius Pilate and Tiberius Caesar as well. The Oscar Winning role played by Hugh Griffith (the Arab man who provides Heston with four gorgeous white horses for the chariot race) is flamboyant and filled with earthy humor, making him steal every scene that he is in. Palestine born actress Haya Harareet .makes a nice impression as Heston's love interest, determined to protect him by keeping the secret kept by Scott and O'Donnell from him. The sequences involving this subplot are truly heartbreaking.Every detail in this film is excellent, from the widescreen photography to the editing and glorious musical score and the sets. you will not want to take your eyes off the screen for one moment during The Chariot race, and to put it bluntly, you may not even want to take your eyes off the screen while this film is on. Like other films that show Christ's crucifixion, that element is very disturbing, but is truly moving because it gives its hero the motivation to go on and be a better person. Films like this can often come off as preachy or sanctimonious, but after multiple viewings, it still gave me chills as it reached its heart-wrenching conclusion. There is a sincerity in the screenplay and the direction and the structure that prevents it from seeming to obviously proud of itself. It succeeds in every mission that it set out to strive for.",10,0,0,13 April 2020
Saving Mr. Banks," Justifying the artist's demands.
","An unhappy woman becomes a smashing success thanks to the publication of what is now a children's classic. Like many artists, she seemed to abhor fame and when Hollywood beckoned, she declined. Well, at least with the creator of the allegedly happiest place on earth. The woman was the Austrian born P.L. Travers, her boss to be Walt Disney, and her leading character a nanny almost as prickly as her who was known as Mary Poppins.It should be noted that the first production of Mary Poppins anywhere was a television version starring character actress Mary Wickes back in 1949. Ironically, right before the movie first went into production, Wickes posed for artist drawings for Cruella Deville in '101 Dalmatians'. That was an the animated film, and P.L. Travers wanted no part of animation for her story. She showed up in Los Angeles in 1961 already copping an attitude, and her first meeting with Disney, songwriters the Sherman Brothers and the screenwriters and director did not go off well in the least. But as the Disney magic begin to roll in, this Travers focus on her life as a little girl, her family problems and incidents which she would later utilized in creating her classic stories. Some of the flashbacks slow the film down completely, but her character would not really be understandable had they been omitted.Honestly, I liked the character of P.L. Travers, here played by the glorious Emma Thompson portrayed with a prickly look like 'Wicked Witch of the West' Margaret Hamilton. She is certainly not fond of little children, being rather aggravated by the presence of tons of teddy bears and other stuffed animals in her hotel room. She's rather curt with children when she meets them and even at Disneyland won't sign autographs. But in spite of all of that, there is something underneath the surface that shows the sad little girl, and because of that I was able to like her in spite of her being a tremendous grouch. When she during her first hearing of 'Let's Go Fly a Kite', it is a magical moment just like the many that Disney provided over its glory years. I must admit, however, that Tom Hanks simply seems to be playing Tom Hanks, vaguely made up to resemble Walt Disney but really not coming like him from my memory of original building of the wonderful world of Disney back during the Glory Days of my own childhood. That is a minor complaint, because I have seen many other portrayals of real-life figures that were even further away than from what Hanks does with Walt. When Emma Thompson is on screen, the film truly shines and its success is due in the most part to her very detailed performance which is like nothing she had played every before. The conclusion of her story is sad, and her involvement with the much later stage version rather prickly as well, but what results is a fascinating story of great Hollywood history that minus the flaws was quite an achievement. In a sense, I liked it more than then the film which I think today is highly overrated, and certainly much more than the overblown version that came to Broadway in the middle of the first decade of the millennium.",7,0,1,17 May 2016
The Producers," The cleverness of Mel, the genius of Zero and the humor of Gene turn this into Springtime for Everybody!
","An underrated sleeper at the time of its original release, 'The Producers' has since gone onto cult status thanks to the excellent screenplay and brilliant casting which was definitely not appreciated at the time. The mid-late 60's saw a barrage of flop musicals on Broadway, and in the book 'Not Since Carrie', the reasons are obvious. Too much confidence in the golden age of the Broadway musical had created many egos, star producers like David Merrick and tons of missed opportunities. There were also some major fiascoes, which this spoofs to the max. Only an ego the size of a Max Bielestock (Zero Mostel) could dare to present a musical based upon the life of Adolph Hitler, and the musical sequence, 'Springtime For Hitler', has obviously influenced later Mel Brooks films (just look at 'The Inquisition' from 'History of the World Part I') and other film producers. ('Songbird!', a musical spoof of 'Sweet Bird of Youth' and 'Elephant!', a scathing look at the RSC in 'The Tall Guy', spoofing 'The Elephant Man', are just a few examples.) Here, Max and exhausted bookkeeper Leo Bloom (an excellent Gene Wilder) aren't out to make a buck. They are out to loose it, that is for the other investors, so they finance their show with way more than 100% of what they need. Their intentions are to 'Grab That Dough!' and sneak off to Brazil on the opening night closing. As fate would have it, the show is a big hit, and eventually, the accountants close in. So what do you do? Put on a musical in prison, of course, with the intention of transferring it to Broadway upon your release.It's ironic that Brooks chooses Hitler to spoof here, especially since he looked so much like David Merrick, 'the abominable showman', whose fascinating life behind the scenes of Broadway's golden age could be a mini-series in itself. As Mel explained, 'What better way to get vengeance on a master criminal like Hitler than to make him look like a fool?' A dangerous fool, to be certain, but by making him look at a buffoon, he's reminding future villains of history that they too are ripe for spoofing. Just look at Saturday Night Live and its scathing images of recent world villains. Mel Brooks knew exactly what he was talking about, and his initial failure has brought him the last laugh thanks to a Broadway musical that revitalized the Broadway musical when it really needed it, and has definitely influenced the next wave of movie comedy men. Without 'The Producers', many of the great spoofers of cinema (Woody Allen, Carl Reiner, Neil Simon among them) might have had a tougher time expressing their distaste towards the world through comedy, showing that not only is laughter the best medicine, but perhaps the true way to educate the world to its foibles and follies.So the next time you refer to something as 'bad taste', take a look at the non-P.C. genius of these men who teach that the world which can laugh at itself is the type of the world which will truly survive. Horny old ladies anxious to pass over 'the checkie', sexy Swedes who believe 'When you got it, flaunt it', nerdy accountants who don't think they can ever break out of the florescent lights of a miserable and boring career, and Broadway producers who are determined to become immortally infamous will keep you in stitches.",9,0,2,29 December 2014
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Find your grail, but be warned, it's filled with laughter!
","It's very fortunate that 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail' has become mainly a camp classic thanks to the extremely funny Broadway version 'Spamelot' which lovingly preserved it and has since gone on to great status to where it certainly is going to eventually be made into a movie itself. With a few songs used later on in the Broadway version (which also included one song from 'The Life of Brian'), 'Holy Grail' on its own is worthy of being perhaps one of the funniest movies of the 1970's. And it all starts with coconuts! Whether it be head chopping rabbits, cows flying off the roofs of forts, forest guards demanding shrubbery's, men in all the women's roles, not quite so dead corpses or riddle asking bridge guards, there's something always going on to keep this interesting. Of course, if you've listened to the music of the Broadway version over and over again, this might seem a bit dry for American tastes, but with additional viewing, it does begin to come together. Like the same year's 'Rocky Horror Picture Show', this has a script with dialog that quickly becomes individual favorite lines, and even with some very gory scenes, it never ceases to be hysterically funny.",8,0,2,12 August 2015
Gangs of New York," They all thought that they were fighting in the name of God.
","I don't think that you're supposed to like anybody in this epic story of civil war era New York City where hatred because of different Christian faiths shows the hypocrisy of an evil time. It was the era of slavery, the time where brother fought brother, where corruption was king, and survival meant getting what somebody else owned. In a sense, it was as bad, or possibly worse, than life in the old country, all in the name of religion and keeping the unwanted out, or at least down. The issues of the draft leads to the riots as men able to buy their way out find free blacks taking their jobs for less money, revealing even more hatred and leading to really inhumane treatment of the newly free that has shaped racial views across the country today. This all makes me wonder if supposedly educated, civilized men were really barbarians in expensive suits.There has been much written and documented about New York City history, and a spectacular PBS documentary goes into detail about rial hatred as New York became the megacity of a country not yet at its centennial. It starts decades before the civil war with a nasty fight between Irish immigrants (the 'dead rabbits' gang) and American born brutes (simply called the Native Americans) where a young Irish boy witnesses the brutal slaying of his father (Liam Neeson) in battle and years later (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) returns for revenge against the killer (Daniel Day Lewis). DiCaprio has been institutionalized for over a decade, and his seething anger hides behind a seemingly calm but determined demeanor. DiCaprio manages to worm his way into Lewis's circle, becoming one of his few confidantes, only awaiting the moment to strike. A rather nasty streetwalker/petty thief (Cameron Diaz) begins a love/hate relationship with him. While it's nice to see women in this era being portrayed realistically, there's nothing nice about her as she is quite crafty for such a soft looking lass.While the layout of the city hasn't changed, architecture has, and the Five Points area of downtown Manhattan looks nothing like this now. Real life famous New Yorkers of the time (or infamous in the case of Boss Tweed) appear throughout; The head of Tammany hall who created much of the hatred between the Irish immigrants and the natives is also joined by Horace Greeley (the man honored with a park near 34th and 6th Avenue) and the Schemmerhorn family, and views of their lavish Fifth Avenue homes are seen, both as splendid reminders of an old glamorous midtown now gone and as the subject for violent break-ins that certainly ended up with brutal murders of some of them. While DiCaprio and Diaz are excellent, it is Lewis who commands most of the attention with his brutish characterization outlined with an earthy charm. The film made me feel like I went back in time over 150 years, and even though there are other other eras of New York history I'd prefer to visit, I'm glad I got to spend nearly three hours in reel time as opposed to real time. As well made as this is, I found it more than just a little repulsive overall, and certainly won't be revisiting this like other modern classics. Technically and historically, it is brilliant, but I cannot praise this as the masterpiece that it's been made out to be.Violent and disturbing, this does still feel as if it is being somewhat truthful, even though it's a bit too exploitative as far as the sexuality and bloodshed are concerned. There's a few presumed homosexual prostitutes seen among the street whores, dressed in women's clothing, acting rather mincing, yet still showing facial hair, and it's interesting to see a subject of ancient New York history that prior to the 20th century little is known about. I found their being right out in the open rather far-fetched, however, and I wonder the reasons for director Martin Scorsese including such characters in a story that didn't require them. The historical aspect of this era should be documented on film as it has been here, but the rancid atmosphere prevents it from pulling me in completely. Nothing has changed much outside the architecture, automobiles and most unfortunately, technology.",7,0,2,26 July 2017
The Wedding Singer," Back when it was OK to be a boomer!
","For those of us who came of age in the 1980's and 1990's (or came of age in the 80's but didn't really grow up until the 1990's), this is a nostalgic, lovable reminder of the better times that took us past the fact that we had Reagan and Bush Sr. as presidents. We also had the early years of Madonna, Cindy Lauper, the Pet Shop Boys, fun dive bars crowded during daylight and fabulous party clothes. The music was filled with reverb, the movies gave us hope for romance, friendship and fabulous places to visit, and for a movie from the late 1990's to take us back to that time, it often brings on a tear of recollection and the thought of 'Where did the time go, and how do we get those good times back?'This is the funny, nostalgic, romantic story of wedding singer Robby Hart (Adam Sandler in his very best performance) and waitress Julia Sullivan (an endearingly sweet Drew Barrymore) dealing with their romantic issues. Robby's been dumped at the alter by his trashy fiancee (Angela Featherstone), and Julia's engaged to a real jerk (Matthew Clave), and their initial meeting at a fun-filled wedding leads to a friendship that turns to romance as they realize slowly how much they were made for each other. An ensemble of wacky characters become involved in every aspect of their life including Barrymore's easy but basically decent sister (Christine Taylor), the flashy but shy Alexis Arquette as Sandler's openly gay singing buddy, and especially Ellen Albertini Dow as his loving grandmother who brought him up.This film isn't just about the story; It is about references to 80's culture, with lots of little funny bits with advertising tie-ins (probably for products which no longer existed 12 years later), fashion trends and lots of various other cultural mentions of celebrities long out of the limelight. The elderly Ms. Dow will steal your heart from the moment you see her (she does for me in several other films as well), and it is certainly easy to root for Sandler and Barrymore in this, the first of several films they did together. The Broadway musical captured all of the magic of the original, and included two of the original songs written for this film including the sweet 'I Want to Grow Old With You'. Dow easily steals the scene with her very brief rap, and the only flaw is not letting her complete the song.",8,0,0,28 June 2020
Jurassic Park," A child's fantasy, but the world's nightmare.
","When man messes with the secrets of nature, they are going to live to regret it, that is if they live to see it. 'Think of it as a big cow', scientist Sam Neill tells the kids he's trapped in the jungle when a herbivore visits the tree they are sleeping in a tree that the friendly dinosaur grabs a ton of leaves from to make a huge salad. But even big herbivores can crush a small human with their gigantic feet, and then there are the carnivores which come in all sizes, and even a small one can devour a full grown man in a matter of minutes, bones and all.If the shark of 'Jaws' was frightening, the T-Rex and other species recreated at Richard Attenborough's mysterious island compound that he has set up as a possible amusement park. But there is no amusement when every species of meat eaters go after human prey.Impressive and cinematic, this was a huge blockbuster that came the same year as the film that won Steven Spielberg his very first Oscar, 'Schindler's List', and it is a total contrast from that now classic drama about surviving the worst real event in modern history. 'Jurassic Park' is about survival, too, and one that we pray never comes true with human involvement.Between Neill and Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum and Attenborough, this is pretty star-studded. The kids get grating at times, but the mixture of tense action and humor makes for a thrilling film. Once again, composer John Williams creates a classic score, adding to the many he's already done for a Spielberg film.For me, this is a reminder why science needs to keep its corrupt fingers off of the mysteries of nature. Dinosaurs are fascinating, but there is a reason why civilization has thrived while they became extinct. I look at this as just one possibility of how they lived, how they looked, and possibly how they interacted with whatever human beings looked like when these not always friendly giants roamed the earth.",10,4,6,30 April 2016
Beetlejuice," A comedy classic for the modern ages.
","When a pale faced, mop-haired creature from beyond comes along to teach some recent dead about how to deal with the living while still roaming the planet as ghosts, trouble is about to brew. In the hands of novice director Tim Burton, one of the great comedy masterpieces came along to inspire others, yet has never been surpassed. Rising stars Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis portray the happily wed couple, having just moved into their new suburban home, yet killed in a freak accident. They are warned by their adviser Sylvia Sidney (think welfare worker for the dead) to totally ignore 'Beetlejuice' and certainly never say his name three times, much like human beings were warned not to feed gremlin Gizmo after midnight.Why are the unusually quiet Baldwin and Davis so desperate to scare the new residents (Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O'Hara, along with Gothic daughter Winona Ryder) out of their house? That's because they are ghosts, and that is what ghosts do. The veteran 30's leading lady Sidney, smoking with the exhaust coming out of an obvious slit throat (which made me think that this was her aunt scared to death by the raven in 'Damien: The Omen II'), delivers her lines with that raspy crankiness of an aging New York Executive Secretary and is hysterically funny. Michael Keaton too takes on this role with a great challenge, devouring it like the zag-nut bar he offered to the title character's desired fly lunch.As the WASPY artist family who has taken over the home, Jones and O'Hara are the perfect befuddled couple who obviously can't stand each other, with Ryder perfectly droll as Jones' daughter from an earlier marriage. The comic gags come fast and furious, first with O'Hara suddenly breaking into 'Day-O' as the ghosts of Baldwin and Davis take over her and the guests, then when 'Beetlejuice' shows them how to do it at a second dinner party where the frights are heightened.The potential genius for Tim Burton had already been seen in the sleeper hit 'Pee Wee's Big Adventure' and has continued on to this day. This is a director who obviously will one day be in the ranks of Hitchcock, Fellini, Vincent Minnelli and John Ford (among others) where just the mention of their name brings up visuals of great art within the world cinema. The only thing I can say about this movie is that unlike other Tim Burton movies, it hasn't aged as well, and often seems like a surrealistic experience which at times just became a bit perplexing to get through.",6,0,3,7 September 2013
All the President's Men," Running into dead ends with brick walls at every turn.
","'Most people don't care about Watergate anymore', Washington Post boss Jason Robards tells his top two reporters, Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford, as this film begins its wrap up. But Hoffman and Redford, as Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward, do care, and they persevere, especially after Robards tells them to take 15 minutes off to rest, then get back out there and finish the job. The infamous 'Deep Throat' (Hal Holbrook, seen in shadows, that fabulous profile still obvious) gives them enough information at first to get them intrigued, but as the two fairly decent journalists persevere to get the scoop of the century, they find that a lot of people in Washington who worked for the Committee to re-elect the President (Nixon) are not willing to even have a cup of coffee with them let alone risk their lives or careers by spilling the beans. The two however refuse to leave well enough alone, and end up blowing the men working for 'Tricky Dick' out of the water.Only days after our most recent presidential election, I re-watched this amazing drama which at 2 hours and 20 minutes is never boring. In this now classic political expose on the ruthlessness of government, it is the screenplay (by William Goldman based upon Bernstein and Woodward's book) who is the star, even though the two leading men are great in it and Robards deservedly won an Academy Award. Every word spoken by each actor rings true, and every action rings of honesty. Robards, Jack Warden, Martin Balsam and John McMartin are Woodward and Bernstein's colleagues at the paper, while an ensemble of some of the best character performers around fill out the cast. Nicolas Coaster, Polly Holliday, Jane Alexander, Allyn Ann McLearie and Sloane Shelton are just among the 'real people' they encounter while discussing such real life famous people as John Mitchell, G. Gordon Liddy and H. R. Haldeman as visuals of Nixon, Spirow Agnew and Gerald Ford are seen in real news clips.It is ironic that Hollywood released this film during the Bicentennial year to show how honesty and integrity will always be the goals of the people who elect the officials who make the decisions that guide our great country. Almost forty years later, politics is as dirty, if a bit more sinister, and the recent campaign reiterated what movies like 'Advise and Consent' and 'The Best Man' have been warning us about for years. Throw in 'All the King's Men', 'The Manchurian Candidate', 'The Candidate' and 'Bullworth' as other films of interest in this category. Films and plays about Nixon have exposed more about the man we only see through newsreels here. As long as writers dare to stand up to expose truth, politicians will always live in fear that their secrets will end up being exposed, as they are here.",10,4,5,10 November 2012
The Wizard of Oz," Click your heels, fly out of Kansas, and go where nobody mourns the wicked.
","For my 2000th review, I felt it would be appropriate to visit the film that I saw 20 times by the time I was 20. Between countless network T.V. viewings (on my grandparent's old T.V. where everything was green, even the black and white Kansas sequences), several big screen visits, hundreds of playings of it at the video store I worked at for 10 years and numerous video covers and different DVD releases, this film has never escaped our culture, and thus my life. My favorite VHS cover was the one in red which focused on the witch and her crystal ball, but that was out of print almost immediately after its release, while the one copy I owned was the blue '50th Anniversary' special edition which came with a ton of extras.While throughout grade school, I was obsessed, not only with the film, but the book too, I made a point of seeing it every time network T.V. aired it. When I first discovered it on video, I was thrilled to be able to see it without commercials and certainly without edits. I was also surprised to find out how much was edited from the film, and like Angela Lansbury quoted about the film in her documentary on its filming, 'How long is too long?'. Certainly, I would have loved to see the filmed footage of 'The Jitterbug' rather than the home movies, but it is obvious from what I have seen that it takes away from the flow of the completed film. What would have been more interesting was the lavish sequence (seen briefly in one of the re-release trailers) of Dorothy and her friend's return from the witches' castle.Of course, the star-making performance of Judy Garland is the heart and soul of this breathtaking fantasy, often imitated but never surpassed. She's a bit busty for the role of the pre-teen Dorothy, but her sincerity is magnetic. There was a genius behind all her madness and as sorry as you can feel for her because of all her woes, you can't feel sorry for the artist who to this day strikes a cord in non-fans, not to mention those of us who consider her the single greatest female performer of all times.There's no better supporting cast (although much of the roles were initially mentioned for other actors), with Ray Bolger an absolute rubbery delight as the Scarecrow, Jack Haley tender and gentle to the max as the Tin Man, and Bert Lahr a blubbering gem as the Cowardly Lion. No good witch was more glamorous than Billie Burke's Glinda (even all the blonde starlets in Broadway's 'Wicked'), and for pure fright, no wicked witch was scarier than Margaret Hamilton's. I became a huge fan of this wonderful character actress as a child, and to this day, I delight in finding works of hers I hadn't seen yet. Hamilton's Miss Gulch reminds me of the delightfully nosy neighbors of my childhood, and to see her in the same outfit the year later sticking her nose up to W.C. Fields' in 'My Little Chickadee' was a comic treat.While Fields was mentioned as a candidate for the role of the wizard, it was Frank Morgan, a stuttering gem of a comical character actor who ended up with the role. He appears in an assortment of other roles, beginning in the Kansas sequence, and later as the doorman of Oz and the doorman to the wizard, all disguised to make you think that he's actually another character, which is doubtful. Hamilton obviously is not only Miss Gulch and the Western Witch, but in the brief guise of the Eastern Witch as well. Of course, in 'Wicked', Nessarose is a lot more beautiful than her sister, only made ugly in spirit by her change in character which didn't ring true.In smaller roles, Charley Grapewin and Clara Blandick as Uncle Henry and Auntie Em offer wise, if distant, support to Judy Garland's Dorothy, with Grapewin very funny as he reluctantly greets the Gulch Woman and Blandick downright hysterical as she tells her off. Toto is an adorable pooch, and I long for a spoof of him getting his revenge on Gulch by biting her in the tush before jumping out of the basket. So as I reflect in my journal of my journey down the yellow brick road, I must call it a lifetime of great and powerful entertainment where every character has become an important part of my child-like heart in my transition to find my own land of Oz.",10,6,7,20 August 2014
