Angels & Demons," Pathetic, trite, linear in the extreme
","This is a really bad film. It's quite run-of-the-mill executed, but with that budget, those actors and the Hollywood-esquire resources they had, I'm just appalled that these people couldn't come up with anything better. Talk about ruining the collective consciousness as related to film. Now, I wasn't expecting greatness when I saw this, just something that was above par when compared with 'The Da Vinci Code', which I think sucked but had something in the albino monk that tried to kill kill kill incessantly. So, if somebody would please graciously hack that film into something with just the albino, I'd be satisfied; the film would no doubt be much more exciting than seeing the main character find evidence and clues in everything he finds; oh yeah, so what about this film? The same. More of the same, only more trite; he shows the token female lead how clever he is, evades the enemy from time to time and makes all of Matt Damon in 'Good Will Hunting' look stupid. My girlfriend fell asleep while we watched this; she's the lucky one out of us. Don't see this.",2,3,5,27 July 2009
Requiem for a Dream," Lucid, avant-garde and brilliant
","I expected this film, permeated with the sense of human downfall through means of legal and illegal substances and methods, to be more in-your-face, but no. Instead, this film is heart-felt, warm and lucid, at the same time as it's living Hell. The direction is radiant with audacity and calm; there's nothing here to indicate that director Darren Aronovsky is trying too hard or, indeed, too little. The absolutely brilliant soundtrack (yet again delivered by Aronovsky's long-time cohort Clint Mansell, this time with The Kronos Quartet) delivers a massive backdrop to the unpredictable scenery. Avant-garde quick clips between iconographic imagery are used to punctuate movements in time (e.g. person getting high on drug). The acting is acute and good. This is like a story you want to end, but when it has, you keep it in your heard and mind forever. Please, see this.",9,3,6,28 August 2007
Hereditary," Modern, twisted, and very well-made
","When films like this come along, they leave most others vanishing in the night, like specters conjured by an amateur. This film, however, brings light in the form of darkness, deep-seated knowledge of both film-making and grand design that pays off.I can imagine that this film is not for everyone. Just as I thought I understood its structure, it threw me off. It did the same a bit later, which I had expected. What I hadn't expected, was how brilliantly the film had been directed; so many facets come together with this film. The cinematography is beautiful and yet a little experimental. The story takes its twists and turns, just as a true horror film should, in my eyes; make no mistake, this is no humdrum Friday the 13th wannabe, but a modern film that reinvents the view of family.Humanity is somehow at the core of this film, and traditional values. As such, it's a quite American, if not western, creation. The film bears those hallmarks of Hollywood in mind.Toni Colette acts impeccably, as usual.",8,1,2,22 February 2019
Inglourious Basterds," Long, very well-written, well-directed feminist film
","This film left me a bit dumbfounded, as I'd forgotten Tarantino's staunch penchant for writing female roles in the feminist sense, i.e. portraying women as they are. Stanley Kubrick notoriously once answered a question of what he likes when making films by saying he knew what he didn't like, and to me, that is the essential of Tarantino's scripting of female roles. So, all in all, a feminist script. Good. But what about the film in other aspects? While the Kill Bill series served as a complete homage to Asian cinema, especially the pulp parts, this film waves hi to the western spaghetti films while staying true to his dialogue-cum-monologues. In every scene, Tarantino seemingly has decided that one or two character steals the scene with some quite outlandish acting. While Christoph Waltz's acting is completely wonderful, the direction is tight and led me through a simple and great film, where two parallel stories start the film: one French girl is separated from her family because of the Nazis and small American group of soldiers, commanded by Brad Pitt's character, is led into Germany to 'kill Nazis'. Every scene is very non-apologetic. No big Hollywood scores are played as people are killed and most of the killing is displayed as-is. Come to think of it, most of everything in this film is displayed as-is, i.e. not sugar-coated. It's a funny, tragic and hugely entertaining story of revenge - an obvious line through most films by Tarantino - and is well worth your time.",8,3,10,4 September 2009
Spice World," Simple, thrown-together in an instant and easy
","Never mind that there is no story to speak of that the script seems to have been written as the players were collated, and let's forget all about music films like 'Imagine'; this is the late 90s, and The Spice Girls were probably the biggest band on the planet. In this film, they rally to keep the band together, play gigs, keep an intrusive film-crew away and their manager — played by Richard E. Grant — calm. By the way, you have to laugh at people like Bob Hoskins, Elvis Costello, Jools Holland and Stephen Fry turning up to have a go. The film is a collection of ideas, all tossed together to make money off the Spice-phenomenon, all the while turning out great pop music to the girl power-beat. Actually, it worked wonders in comparison with the pap of today, as far as groups like the atrocious Pussycat Dolls are concerned, who carry no discernible message other than flaunt your body to have your way, and don't think. Go spice!",5,0,2,19 April 2009
500 Days of Summer," Sweet, lovely, simple and complex
","A little spoiler alert is in place here, so read on only if you dare. I really liked this film. The dialogue felt real, as did the characters. The script contains a lot of pretentious and impressive twists that all feel real. The film made me feel that the clichés and the little things that made the characters happy and sad are what mattered. That everyday feeling, together with the constant anachronistic jumping in time and the 'supernatural' sequences (e.g. where Tom turns a walk to work into a musical daydream with drawn birds and a big band), the brilliant soundtrack (with Morrissey regalia to boot, imagine that) and a lot of desire turned this film into a great experience for me. Very cute, calm, American (I feel, as a non-American) and recommendable.",8,1,3,5 November 2009
Juno," OK but not much more, tried too hard
","'Alternative. Alternative. I've gotta be alternative and still appeal to people who don't know who Dario Argento is. Do like 'Garden State' crossed with 'Rosemary's Baby' except for the horror being switched for quick comedy. I can't believe I just thought of Polanski and not Troma or something just as alternative and/or cool!' I guess those were the words of the scriptwriter. This film is fair, brings a couple of laughs and is quite coherent, and apart from the odd good music there's not that much laudable in this box; I can't get over the feeling that the film-makers have tried too hard to make this film feel all fresh, so much that they kind of overlooked the factor that made Ricky Fits the great character he was in 'American Beauty'. Watch 'L'Avventura' again, I say.",5,2,8,27 April 2009
X-Men," No story with some really bad consequences
","The story is just not good enough for thinking people, which all of us should be, eh? I mean, just escaping from humans because they are 'all' against mutants is what the film is about. And it does not work. If this movie contained anything more than special effects, it could perhaps stand on its legs, but now it's sadly just limping.I put my hope in 'AI', the film that Stanley Kubrick was to direct. Now, let us all pray Steven Spielberg does the trick.",2,1,2,9 August 2000
Cloverfield," Quite dumb with wafer-thin script despite promising start and special effects
","Having failed to see this film at an Odeon theatre in London (my girlfriend became violently sea-sick), I thought the promising beginning of it could be a precursor to how the film would end up. A cool monster-flick, yeay! I was wrong. All in all, the film is almost worse than Spielberg's take on 'War Of The World'. A group of people form in New York, USA, to say good-bye to a friend who's going away to work in Tokyo, Japan. Everything that is seen is filmed by a participant of the party, who is quite uninteresting as a person, hence in my eyes numbing the film a little. Anyway, as a few of the characters squander to intrigue over who's hooking up with who, something detonates. People find something otherworldly is tearing up NY. Woo! Sadly, this was the promising bit. Hereafter all is running - with no suspense á la 'Alien' whatsoever - or trying to avoid dying, which is boring. I felt little or no sympathy for the characters, and the script felt very thin. All in all, nice special effects but a very dumb film which feels bad, as I think it could have become good with a bit more thought and intelligence.",2,0,1,26 May 2009
Crash," Fast-paced and prejudiced
","A film entirely about prejudice and consequence, it delves a lot deeper than I thought it would, as I - prejudiced as I was - had heard a lot about it, mainly critique saying that even though the film's made to make people question their own readymade ideas that aren't based on rational thinking, that's exactly what it did. I'll happily say I think those critics are wrong. In my opinion, the film points out prejudice in the viewer and yes, I'm one of the persons who thinks everybody is prejudiced about a lot of things, even though some of us may be scared to admit it at first. This film is a good step towards realising this, by plainly showing how racism, nationalism and other isms play a daily role in our lives. Fast-paced, catchy, horrible and funny, I strongly recommend it.",8,0,4,10 November 2008
Little Miss Sunshine," Nice, likable, non-linear and simple
","If I were Josef Goebbels, I'd probably review this film like this (including spoilers): 'Another farce made, this time by the Americans. When will they know that successful propaganda can be successful only when the arguments used work to their advantage, and not against them? Here, a homosexual cuts his wrists. Are we to feel akin to him through this? The upbringing of the American nuclear family implodes throughout this film; the father has failed in the upbringing of his family, his _white_ family. How can this be? We would never allow this through our media, yet another fact displaying the fall of the socialist regime. His woman is let to shout at him unpunished, and he has failed in rearing his female child, which rules him at a whim to partake in a vain, American cultural contest which is nonsensical as their child is not Aryan. The child, the female child, rules the male parent? Unheard of in The Reich!The only person to respect in the beginning of this nonsense is the masculine child, who revers Nietzsche, yet has his goal obliterated by gay propaganda. All in all: nothing to see. Even Leni could have jolted life into this mess. Two swastikas down.' I, on the other hand, like this film, which is a feel-gooder; Steve Carrell plays the best part seen him do so far (much like Adam Sandler in 'Punch-drunk Love'), and the script and tempo works much to the film's advantage. There is almost no soundtrack, and the action is sparse, which also works good. This film is like having a relaxing bath, yet I stayed on my toes as the film challenged me by not being linear. It's enticing on several levels. All in all, sweet, and the finale is lovable on many a level. I recommend it.",7,0,1,20 July 2008
Ratatouille," Effective, prejudiced and fallable
","This is a Pixar/Disney-flick about a rat that dreams of not having to steal food, but somehow..._acquire_ it, while wanting to become a chef. The rat's family is hit by a catastrophe, forcing the rat to end up in Paris, where it by a series of accidents ends up a puppeteering chef. Don't ask. This film is very Disneyish, letting you know what will happen miles in advance. It tries to combat prejudice while unleashing it; being a rat's not bad, being French is a walking stereotype. Blah. Boring. Still, this film gives way for a few laughs. It's predictable and good, but nothing, really, in comparison with 'Finding Nemo'. Note: I saw a version where the voices were dubbed by Swedish actors.",5,3,8,8 October 2007
Control," Ian Curtis: coward, poet, hero, lonely
","Ian Curtis was a coward, a poet, a hero and lonely. His legacy is Joy Division, a band he left by killing himself as the band was due to start their debut American tour. As the remnants of the band reformed as New Order, Curtis is personally mostly known through Deborah Curtis' - his wife - book, 'Touching From A Distance'. Through this film, Anton Corbijn has left his signature visual effects behind to reach further than before, thus allowing this film growth. Filmed in black-and-white, Manchester is portrayed as a gritty town where Thatcher's reign is firmly at hand, and the musical scene is emerging thanks to bands like the Sex Pistols and the Buzzcocks. Joy Division differed a lot. Curtis personal lyrics and deep voice stamped a deathly human touch upon the band's sound, and the film stamps the same upon his personal life, erasing the line between the two. This is a harrowing tale of a haunted individual who created some of the very best lyrics of the decade. The cinematography is brilliantly executed, the soundtrack is (of course) gleaming and the actors very good: not employing any stars was a good thing by Corbijn, I say. There is a tantamount number of scenes that stay engraved in my mind from this film, which can help resurrecting the kitchen sink-genre. See it. It is human.",8,0,1,14 January 2008
No Country for Old Men," Chilling puzzle that unveils a great image
","The Cohen brothers have left their mark on American film, no doubt about that; 'Fargo' is one of my favourites, where everything in it, like a puzzle, made a wonderful big picture. The same goes for this film, where script, direction, acting and cinematography play equal parts alongside long-time Cohen-accomplice Carter Burwell's chilling soundtrack to make this a film about consequence, circumstance and cold-blooded action - the latter in stark contract to Tommy Lee Jones' brilliant portrayal of an experienced and jaded - yet human - sheriff. It must be said that I think Javier Bardem's performance is worthy of the Oscar he won a week ago. He's chilling like hell, but as written was, not only because of his supreme acting, but the script, cinematography, the Cohen's sublime sense of using silence, timing and soundtrack. This is a must-see film.",9,4,7,3 March 2008
Foxcatcher," Near-visceral, very well-written film
","One can tell that Dan Futterman - who wrote 'Capote' - has been here. The film breathes where it could have been cramped by excess dialogue or soundtrack, but instead, one gets a seldom seen insight into the head of a wrestler - played by Channing Tatum - who otherwise could have been portrayed as a thick slab of concrete, not to mention his coach - played by Steve Carrell - a rich man who tries to solve his problems (seemingly all based around his will to impress his mother) by throwing money at them.This is a deeply human and somewhat scary film that allows the viewer to make its own mind up. The components really blend to make this film work, and it's very well written, directed, acted and shot. The photography alone makes this film worth watching, but the script brings this to such heights. See it!",8,2,6,8 February 2015
Gone Girl," Horrid book, bad adaptation
","I hated the book. In the end, it became decrepit but at the beginning, it was evident that the person who made it desperately wanted to seem erudite. Well, a billion purchases by other people later...This film is not poorly made, but it's built on a castle of pap (i.e. the book) and as such, it's not translated badly. Where Fincher succeeds, is about halfway through the film, where a specter comes into play; that scene's good. The rest of the semi-good bits (i.e. cinematography, photo, glossy scenes, soundtrack) are there as well, but I loathed Affleck's acting and I didn't really care about any of the actors. I tried not to dislike the film; I went in with an open heard.This is a crock of pap. Go see George Sluizer's 'The Vanishing' instead.",2,3,6,8 February 2015
The Incredibles," Backlash, boring, prejudiced
","Stunning graphics! New ways to portray animated figures in cinema! Yep, Pixar have done it again. It's really amazing to see.But. We have to see the very boring parts of the film, of which there are many.Apart from this film containing part of the biggest backlash drabness since reading snippets from reality in Susan Faludi's 'Backlash', I must say this: everything in this film has been done before.The story and everything in it is plain 'Our Man Flint' and James Bond. Everything that's shown in the film has been shown before, in non-animated films. And I find that a bit boring, don't you agree? 'We are Pixar! We have the ability to make any kind of film now, that we can do anything with computers, which means we don't have to spend a lot of money for props, expensive actors and film in impossible locations!' So why, kind Madams/Sirs, are we brought re-hashed spy-stories? Pixar has the ability to give the audience the most fascinating computer generated graphics ever, so why not do that AND an interesting story with great characters? I think I know why. Money walks. What? Here: the crowd is obviously loving something they've seen big parts of before, just framed in another way, even more graphic than ever. It's true, I'm sorry. It's easier to mash something like this together than make a new 'The Godfather', 'Fight Club' or 'Seven Samurai'.With 'backlash' I mean the following, which is the worst about this film: female characters aren't allowed to be active individuals in this film. Read that sentence again, then move on. The males are the ones who make the decisions, apart from a couple of instances when the women do, instead of being passive, second rate characters. And this simply isn't acceptable. Why? Because I like films that are realistic, not thoroughly anti-feministic and prejudiced. And I will tell you why I feel this film represents just that.When the darkly dressed, fringe-covering-most-of-her-face, shy and introverted daughter of the family is 'turned to the better', this means she meets a boy who's so far shown her no interest at all, merely by suddenly wearing her hair in a pink tiara and dressing in 'girly clothes', i.e. pink colours and a skirt. She's also passive, as is her mother: while the males in the family are the ones making the decisions, the strong, fast and moving ones, the women are merely stretchy, able to become invisible, able to protect themselves - not to attack. The little boy in the family can hit people, and kill them. Yeay! His big sister just turns...more girly. She hits a few bad guys, sure, but doesn't kill them. Her assailants fall unconscious as she turns invisible and hits them, while the little boy hits the living daylights out of a bad guy, finding out he actually likes to hit them, before his victim flies into a stone wall, dying in an explosion.The men even lie and the women don't, but that's OK, because it's all good family fun. Of course.I am not making the above up. See the film (without paying for it, preferably) and spew yourselves.This is very much reminding me of the myth about lions. People think the male is the King Of The Jungle, when, in fact, the lionesses are the predators, catching the prey and making sure the families progress in every way. The males don't even hunt, as they cannot: the mane prevents them from running much. Still, the myth about them prevails. They're displayed as the Kings Of The Jungle while the female tends the cubs.Sadly, this shows in a lot of ways in this film. The mom works at home. The man DOES work in a very boring environment, but, without spoiling a bit of the film, doesn't exactly do anything about the family situation except lie to his wife. For two months. And this is the 'woman of my life', as he later calls her? This film reeks of disorder. I'm sorry, but of course women and men aren't exactly made out of merely two molds. It's just that this film, no matter how immensely important computer graphics-wise it may be, tries to put through that gibberish. Sad. It could have been immense. Will The Movie Machine churn out more of this garbage? Think critically.",2,11,33,12 December 2004
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Wooden, linear yet somewhat better than the average Swedish mystery film
","Although this is much better than the usual slew of Swedish cinematic mysteries, a few queries must be made: why always inject the same actors in Swedish film? Why is their 'acting' confined to existing, just like wooden objects - most notably Mikael Nyqvist - and not in an interesting IKEA way, even? Why is women still being portrayed as in this film? The low-down of the film is this: a journalist is sentenced to jail for slander, but gets a job from the very rich head of a corporation: find his niece. At the same time, a goth tries to make her way by digging up info on people for magazines, while combatting her demons from the past, which means she has to deal with an abusive counsellor which is obligatory if she's not to be 'shipped off to the mental institution, and we wouldn't want that now, would we?'. Seems to me that in the world of film-making - largely controlled by older men - girls who are individuals, who refuse to conform and basically do things the way that men go about (unpunished) get what this girl gets in the film. All the while, she gets entangled with said journalist and they try to solve the case together. I'm told the books are very well-written, but watching this is like watching the husk of same old Swedish mystery film of the past years re-juvenating for yet another Swedish mystery film. With the same actors. And their same old wooden selves.",3,17,41,23 August 2009
The Imitation Game," Interesting, entertaining and a little too Hollywood-esque for me
","A quite nice little film, although too packaged for Hollywood, for my taste; still, it's nicely wrapped up.Quite in the vein of 'A Beautiful Mind', it follows the genius mind of Alan Turing as he searches to break the Enigma cipher, i.e. the code machine used by the Nazis during WW2.It bounces between Turing's aspergeroid personality, his growing up, his intolerable self, his homosexuality and back, where he faces obstacles, success and, ultimately, death.The obvious irony: he worked to save people from death, but was himself condemned to it, and posthumously 'saved' by the UK monarchy, which is a farce and condemnable by itself.All in all: entertaining, and well made.",6,0,4,16 February 2015
The Dark Knight," Best Batman film so far, Heath Ledger prevails
","Once again, Batman faces The Joker while he delves into himself; the police veer between stamping Batman a criminal and a hero, adding to Batman's list of raging conflicts. A very strong 8/10 makes this the best Batman-film I've seen this far; direction is very good, as Batman is transformed - much like James Bond in that franchise - from super-being to human being, going from Bruce Wayne to hero with friction to follow. Of course, Christian Bale is stale as Batman acting out an untouchable vigilante archetype; the real antihero in this film is The Joker; Heath Ledger betters Jack Nicholson's previous performance as The Joker indefinitely by presenting a meticulously researched, damaged individual who attracts and revolts, psychopathically killing and lying to suit his insane genius at will.While this film presents twists and turns that excite and surprise the plot is on par, being better than most action films, not to mention that of those based on comics. Even though the film loses tempo at times, it didn't lose its grip on me. All in all, this is one of the best action films I've seen in the past years. Bravo!",8,2,5,31 July 2008
Taken," Xenophobic pap with bad script, soundtrack, character portrayals, etc.
","A complete xenophobic clown boat. I was prepared to see something action-y and fairly OK, but this went off the cliff from the start. To begin with, have no preconceptions of any kind of good cinematography, soundtrack, acting, script, character preparation, plot changes or anything that will stir the pot in this one. No imagination seems to have gone into this film, and that's another huge blow against Luc Besson, who actually co-wrote this mess. Where Liam Neeson goes on and on to kill, murder and maim people just to get hold of his daughter, there are a few other aspects here: foreigners are bad, kidnapping is bad, killing anybody to get hold of your kidnapped child is OK. This film has just interrupted the thinking process completely. I've got no qualms of watching brain-dead films, but when it comes to the point where you question the ethics that the film itself brings to life as there's just too much hypocrisy, it's just zany. Fawk this. Go watch some other action crap, it's most likely a lot better than this.",1,3,8,21 October 2012
Frank," Lovely and sad
","This is a funny and sad film that uses the main character, Jon, a boy who's grown up in a little town and dreams of escape, as a kind of rock while quasi-chaos reigns around him, mainly as controlled by Frank, the leader of a band that is beyond the experimental.This film, for me, displays what happens when you're really not being true to yourself, when you're mainly trying to cater to others without a care for what you truly believe in, and when you really don't care about the opinions of those that should be close to you.Interesting soundtrack, well directed, acted and written, this is a simple, lovely indie film that deserves attention.",7,0,1,22 September 2014
From Hell," Poor in a variety of ways, only for JTR fans
","Akin to 'Jack The Ripper'  starring Michael Caine  this film is a mish-mash of bad tempi, bad acting, sloppy direction and a quite poor script that's wasted on good actors such as Johnny Depp, Ian Holm and Robbie Coltrane. This film made me lose interest more than once, which is bad considering I'm a serial killer-fan. While The Hughes Brothers have directed the massive 'Menace II Society', this film is far off that past greatness. Heather Graham's part is that of the Madonna-like prostitute, and very little of London of those past days is displayed 'as were'; for more information about the East End-district of London, please read Patricia Cornwell's 'Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed' and for even more details, Leslie S. Klinger's 'The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes' will provide a lot of the cultural climate, the vast gap between the poor and the rich and those times in general (even though I'm sure there are better anthropological studies available).This film is recommended only for those very interested in Jack The Ripper.",4,2,4,2 January 2008
Love & Mercy," Beautiful, tragic and human
","This is a divided drama, mainly about the adult life of Brian Wilson, the artistic leader of The Beach Boys, the trip through their magnum opus - 'Pet Sounds' - while Brian was dealing with his brothers, the band and his superimposing father, constantly trying to overshadow Brian, as well as displaying him in the modern world, a victim to his legal guardian, while meeting love.It's a carefully threaded history, made with love and meticulous acting. It's as though the director and the actors were paying homage to Brian's legacy while making this film.Beauty is around. And it's not patronising, overblown or too much. If anything, it's kind. And human, open to what can happen to people.",8,2,3,9 October 2015
Steve Jobs," Flawed but semi-interesting
","This is a boxed experience, by which it's clear whom has written it. Style can be great. This is intense, which is cool. It's convoluted. Can be very good. It's not complicated, but often a dirge in reverse; the dialogue is basically the same for all characters, which are all dressed differently. That's an issue that I dislike with Sorkin's films. Well, while a lot of people often behave similarly in real life, it's a murky feature to me, that stands out like broken pixels in a computer screen.Having stated the above points, the film succeeds in displaying Jobs as a flawed person, but given all the hoo-hah that occurs during the film, due to everything happening during Apple events, it's hard to see his self. Well. I can't say I could or would have seen his self during other times, but the documentary 'Steve Jobs: The Man In The Machine' gives much more flesh to Jobs' bones, where this film appears quite shallow. Good acting and, at times, stellar writing is interesting, but as a whole, this film does not work for me. It's scatterbrained, amidst all of its seemingly good intentions and radiance. I rather recommend the documentary to this film.",4,5,11,5 January 2016
The Reader," Very nice feel, very good flowing yet somehow leaving me left for more
","A story that grew in intensity and worth as the film progressed, from being a fairly innocuous, yet dirty-old-lady trashy jaunt with seediness prevalent at every corner about a boy who has an affair with an older woman, to becoming one of morale, perspective and ethics.I can honestly say that I much more enjoyed the flow and general feel of the film more than I did regarding the story itself. The technical aspects didn't make any sort of impression on me, as the omniscient musical score. Winslet winning an Oscar for her part leaves me asking why, but she performed well.All in all, the progression was nice, and as a Swede I must add that I didn't recognise Lena Olin, but I did recognise a Swedish accent among all the faux-German ones.Kudos to Ralph Fiennes for tricking me into thinking he was Liam Neeson for most of the film.It was also weird to see Bruno Ganz - who played Adolf Hitler in 'Der Untergang' - and Fiennes - who played a prominent Auschwitz commendant in 'Schindler's List' - in the WW2-parts of the film. Just me, I guess.",7,1,2,25 February 2009
Sherlock Holmes," review from a Holmes aficionado
","To say I have a lot to do with Sherlock Holmes would be an understatement. For quite some time, I lived and breathed Holmes and the world that Arthur Conan Doyle wrote of. It all began when I was 12 years old and crossed paths with the TV-series produced by Granada, where Jeremy Brett played Holmes. My mind expanded, not only by seeing the most powerful and well-known private consulting detective in the world trip the light amazing through the aid of a seven-per-cent solution of cocaine in 'The Sign of Four', but because Brett was The One. I knew he _was_ Holmes. And slowly my obsession took shape. I watched the Rathbone films, started - granted, at a much later age - following Holmes' adventures through the short-stories, then the novels, then more films before stumbling onto the web and Leslie S. Klinger's 'The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes', an ubiquitous tome for all those impaired by the virus to know all. To compare. To sketch out paths, know how Holmes came to certain conclusions and to eradicate him from guilt (where Doyle made some logical errors in the stories about Holmes; which are, of course, not errors at all...). In short, yes, I love the Sherlock Holmes universe. Of course all aided by my anglophilia and the fact that I, severely interested in serial-killers, have followed the world of Jack The Ripper very closely from a young age; that age is approximately the very same as that of Holmes'. It all blends and comes together, deerstalker, blood, London and awe. Ooh, I love it.And here comes Guy Richie with a film, an American actor (Robert Downey Jr.) as Holmes and Jude Law as a quite acrobatic Watson. These two are about to part ways as Watson is to marry, and Holmes falls head-long into a slump of sorts, not wanting Watson to leave him. Along comes Lord Blackwood, the most acerbic villain, ever. He dresses goth-cum-Gestapo and acts Most Evil in the most tawdry manner, merely being a wooden plank at best. Oh, we get it. He's bad. And Downey-Holmes? Most of the time he displays his ways of applying logic to win by fighting. Holmes knew how to fight, and despite preferring mind to rule over matter, Richie has apparently thought the film to be at its best through brawn rather than brain.And comedic passings, for the dark, musky men who seek out Holmes' destruction are all very furrowed brows and simply lead. I went to the cinema with an open mind, having seen the trailer and not thinking about the consequences; I let myself see this without trying to see Downey-Holmes as Holmes, as with the rest of the characters. Marsan-Lestrade was fair, but definitely not McAdams-Adler, who was a faint memory of the ephemeral and intelligent person from The Canon. Well, intelligence pushed aside, was there a saving grace? Yes, the film was quite entertaining. It reminded me of 'Young Sherlock Holmes', a 1985 film made with heart with no basis in The Canon, where the young Holmes and Watson meet up and try to thwart an evil empire as run by cultists. A few non-basic elements from the film were snatched from The Canon as well, e.g. the coach-ride from 'The Greek Interpreter', and Holmes' guessing the identity of a person as in 'A Scandal In Bohemia'. But, also pushing The Canon aside, was there anything to this? Yes, I'd say an action-filled blockbuster aimed for the American-international market through slightly English eyes, stirring up a couple of laughs, awakening my boyish need for adventure-films. I like Downey Jr.'s acting, even though this film did not require any subtleties, never mind the masterful acting that Brett performed in said TV-series. Law did good. McAdams was boring. Of course there'll be a sequel to this film, and of course I'll see it, but I daresay I won't be paying for it.",3,11,20,3 January 2010
Music and Lyrics," Avoid at all costs: no cigar
","A genuine stinker of a film. Hugh Grant acts an 80s wash-up singer who's faced with writing a song for the biggest artist in the world. In his crayzee plant-watering girl, he finds a lyricist. And as the back of the DVD reads, 'sweet music develops, in more than one way'. Having watched this film, I felt as though Bernard Herrmann's epic brass for 'Cape Fear' was upon me. Lingering death. I'll try to explain this: death of intelligence, bad words paired together trying to collate as to make out jokes (the only exception being Grant's words on how candy sprayed onto a bunch of old people made him recall Altamont), no romance, no good songs (apart from Moroder's 'The Neverending Story' and a 'nice try' to Bloodshot & Avant who somehow agreed to do a song for this clownboat) and the general feel that all atmosphere left this film a long time ago. Avoid.",1,2,6,19 December 2010
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Jazzy and human
","This is a jazzy, swirly take on a life. The photography is brilliant, despite the fact that it could easily have become all special effects; it works well with the jazz soundtrack - still, the technicalities aren't even the most interesting stuff. Instead, this is a human tale of a man who already is what he once was, a superhero, whose life as the core of a theatre play displays his co-actors, his agent, his daughter (who works at the theatre), his problems, his past fame seemingly always prodding him in the face.The acting from most of the actors (notably Keaton, Norton, Galifianakis and Watts) is mainly sublime and the direction is good; there's a lot of space that's required, much as found in the soundtrack, yet dense enough for a finale that's a little over the top.I enjoyed this film.",8,3,8,8 February 2015
Prometheus," Philosophical, subtle and scary
","First, let me state that I love some of the elements of all of the first three Alien-films: the promise of fright rather than the plastic monster has always been much scarier to me. Second, I like the idea of incorporating something more to a scary film than just sneak-sneak-THERE'S-THE-MONSTER!!. So, 'Prometheus' actually does a fine job at this. It's subtly directed, letting the characters and the actors speak for themselves. The sound and cinematography definitely helps, apart from choosing brilliant actors like Michael Fassbender, Guy Pearce, Charlize Theron and Sean Harris. This film is scary, mostly in a philosophical way, for me questioning humanity, our right to life and our seemingly God-given right to be the top of the food chain; this film probably gives the best slant of the latter for a film than any I've seen in ages. On a stream of consciousness-tip, I can't really state how much the image of an alien that first looks like a penis and then transforms into a vagina-flower-with-penile-stem has haunted me. Recommendable.",7,1,4,10 June 2012
Straight Outta Compton," Drab. Non-confrontational revision of history
","Ghurghgh. I loved N.W.A. for their gall, anger and methods, but hated their misogyny. Still, this film focuses on that, disses MC Ren's abilities to lift the group after Dre left, and yeah, there's more misogyny here, still. Drab. Sad. The best bits are of the band shaping their first album. The rest should be read in books and preferably forgotten. It's not hard to see why Ice Cube went on to surpass what Dre did later, even on his first solo album. I wish one would hear more dissing of Dre courtesy of Eazy-E, buuut--Eazy's dead, so Dre's words take precedence, I guess. And there's even a whole buckload of distasteful ad for beats headphones at the end of the film. Truly bad.",2,138,328,11 January 2016
Fifty Shades of Grey," Horrid, vapid, sad bleed-out of a tale
","Actually, I will start off my review by quoting Anthony Lane's review of this film:'Mostly, he sounds like your basic stalker: 'I'm incapable of leaving you alone,' he informs Ana—a notion that appears to stimulate her, although it would easily warrant a call to 911. She succumbs, up to a point, but her recurring doubts lead Christian to dish up one of those crusty old no-means-yes propositions which feminism has battled for decades: 'You want to leave? Your body tells me something different.' Pass the butt plug.'Indeed. This film is tragic, in a variety of ways, and sexy in none (for me, at least). And probably for a bunch of other people as well, as this film has marked 4.2/10 on IMDb, which is remarkably low. Still, I give this film 1/10 for a variety of reasons.The characters are one-dimensional. The main character is 'god' and, because of the book, is never-smiling and drab. I mean, if he'd only have been interesting in some way! He comes across all Bruce Wayne- y, body sculpted, can do everything (fly a helicopter, play the piano, own at least 75 different neckties), but lacks everything that he should have. Compare this with the lead character in Steve McQueen's 'Shame': he says very little, but exudes so much, much more than this film collectively ever will.The female lead character is just an object, nothing more. A boring, self-deprecating object with a touch of defiance, only there to display her as an individual, somebody who doesn't let anything happen to her as she's master of her own will.Still, pap like 'I'm incapable of leaving you alone' creeps me the hell out, it is _not_ sexy or passionate. It's cheap. And cheapens a lot of things. A lot of people who actually do enjoy BDSM have raised their voices against this film as it's apparently against what is considered safe BDSM use, and goes against more than that.The soundtrack is a safe word in this film; down-watered covers, mainly used to be 'sultry' and 'sensual', no doubt, but are, in fact, like adding poop to your champagne. Not that this film is champagne in any way, shape or form; champagne is palatable. This film is not.Avoid. There will be sequels. I'll avoid those.",1,2,5,6 July 2015
Slumdog Millionaire," Underwhelming, yet fairly good
","Seeing that this film has won basically every accolade known to humankind in 2008, I'm actually underwhelmed, especially considering how this is from the man who directed 'Shallow Grave' and 'Trainspotting'. This time, he covers the life of a boy in India, one who competes for several million rupees in a TV game-show. His life flashes before our eyes as he is apprehended post-show, suspected of cheating, while we witness him growing up. Love, loyalty and the despicable caste-system is in focus here. I think the film was coherent, at times nearly made me cry (which isn't hard, though) but sorely missed any type of avant-garde and even - I think - a fresh view on love between the main character and his girl, which was quite supernatural in a bad way. As a collection of entertainment, this film is good, yet slightly disappointing. Including M.I.A.'s 'Paper Planes' into the soundtrack helped, though.",6,1,7,4 September 2009
Mad Max: Fury Road," Utterly thoughtful, action-crazy, brilliant feministic film
","Just as 'The Thin Red Line' lured loads of boys into cinemas, thinking they'd see something resembling 'Platoon' or a mindless Schwarzenegger flick, 'Mad Max: Fury Road' takes another route.There's enough action here to shake a stick at, mainly where CGI doesn't really stand a chance to the real-live graphical action and the special effects are concerned, but the real difference is in the human, here. Both in the contrasts between good and bad, including all of the grey areas, of which there are, humanly speaking, many.This film manages to inject feminism into your everyday man-packed genre, it's almost maddening to think that this film has come into existence. At the same time, even a broken clock strikes the right time twice a day.Not that THIS is a broken clock. No, no. This is a world where civilisation is not as us rich westerners know it. It's a world where our poorest live, in cities of dust, with the richest at the top, degrading the ones down the hierarchical line, just along the lines of capitalism, making the ones at the bottom think that's where they belong, all cogs serving the greater good, which in the film is named 'Valhalla', to where you gladly sacrifice your life to go, whenever your master feels like it, or you are programmed to.There is no mercy here. No preconceptions like we are used to. People are people. The film starts off brutal, in the wolf's cave, as it where, before Theron's character decides to go off the decided path together with the tyrannical ruler's 'wives' and gets hunted for it.In an early scene, when the escaping party makes a run for it, one of the enslaved 'wives' kicks the chastity belt she's been made to wear, and quickly jumps into a rig.Theron's communication with Hardy is nearly breathtaking. I mean, enough said, right? I loved the nomenclature. The mixture of language. Words such as 'smeg' (possibly culled from TV-series 'Red Dwarf'?), 'kamakrazee' and 'guzzoline' were well-used. Lines like 'Is that just the wind or a furious vexation?' and 'We will McFeast in Valhalla' actually made sense, rather than seeming like something extremely uncomfortable from, say, True Detective (season two).'How long has it been?' - 'Seven thousand days. And then the ones I can't remember.' The film's anti-xenophobic. Just see the interplay where War Boy and Hardy's character is. At first, the hatred is inherent, almost inherited; the more they get to know the situation, themselves and each other, respect and like is gained, as with Hardy's and Theron's characters. It's as though naivitÃ© and innocence are shown as-is: good things, really, in comparison with prejudice.The fights, the action, is nearly without comparison. I was slightly reminded of the introductory scene in 'Saving Private Ryan' when seeing the first battle, but this is beyond that, with a magnificent display made throughout the film. It's really a feministic film, a world based on no bars hold, or rather, on men, women and beings trying to break out of their gender-based cage and away from bad preconceptions.I can't even begin to say how much I loved the action scenes, the cinematography and the quick editing. The soundtrack is just manic, Wagneresque, and it actually works (where that method is usually, 99 times out of 100, trite beyond words), while you have attackers lurking, coming out of every crevice... It's almost like watching Gilliam's 'Brazil', it's so far from this world, that it's almost like watching an action-film apotheosis happening before our eyes, in bright, sparkling colours. Killing never looked this good.This film really stimulates growth in thinking areas, while being ham-fisted in a really good way. THIS is the way to go, for all action films.Just a thing pulled from the IMDb trivia department that says a lot about this film: 'The film editor, Margaret Sixel, is director George Miller's wife. When she asked her husband why he thought she should do it as she had never edited an action film before, Miller replied, 'Because if a guy did it, it would look like every other action movie.'' I love this film.",9,2,13,23 August 2015
Macbeth," Wondrous, breathtaking; horrible humanity
","This is a masterpiece.Where William Shakespeare's tale of betrayal, greed and blindness leaves much room for interpretation, this cinematic version goes beyond what could easily have been a flat, drab interpretation, and makes it come alive and breathe new air into the tale.I hope this adaptation goes around and is seen by all.Fassbender is really involved in this film, as previously seen in 'Shame', as opposed the crappy role he had to play in 'Prometheus'; Marion Cotillard elevates, both by herself and together with Fassbender.The calmness before the storm, breathtakingly filmed and shot first during the initial scenes, is cinematography, acting and direction in wondrous collaboration. It seems all actors are on-point, with one singular goal.This is truly brilliant. The language comes alive, through death and humanity.",9,1,4,25 January 2016
Alien: Covenant," break out the kitty litter
","If you are able to see past the slapstick, the lapse in judgment, the trite, conceited moments - _especially_ in how Shelley-Byron is somehow used to make the viewer see how intelligently everything is when cast in a British-English accent - there's actually a lot of fun here.With 'a lot of', I mean two things:1. James Franco turning into KFC near-immediately after the film started, which was A LOT of fun 2. the Alien scuttling about like a cat on fireSo, there was more alien-on-human touchiness than there was in 'Prometheus', and although I'm sure there was a lot more processing power here than in all of the LOTR films together, the first made Alien films churned out more scariness per minute than this one. And that alien was practically made out of a cardboard box! And was seen about three times during the entire freaking run!The android stuff was utterly predictable, and you don't need the combined powers of Google, Apple, and Microsoft to calculate that. DREADFUL. It's Philosophy 101 but crude in the extreme; like seeing Matt Damon's character in 'Good Will Hunting' marring the college dude while getting the girl's number - oh, I'm so intelligent, look at me.What about that murder-in-the-shower scene? Oh god. Where's Freddy and Jason when we need them? Didn't they make a film with both of them already, and Predator? Wait...To me, the best bit about this film is the part where Fassbender raises his arms to the newly-born alien, which in turn also raises its arms.Thank Bog for a lot of money and very little to show for it.Can anybody allow Ridley Scott to make the next alien flick for a maximum of 1000 USD? That way they may have to be creative and get back to using brains to think this ish through before it's somersaulted against the public.",2,18,37,19 May 2017
