Kill Bill: Vol. 2," so-so
","Lets get this out of the way first. I'm not a Tarantino fan. I don't hate his work (honest!). I've enjoyed Reservoir Dogs and found Pulp Fiction entertaining stuff. It's just that his choice of films doesn't quite sit with me. Now that you've read that, add 2 to my score if you're a fan.Kill Bill Vol.1 was good slapstick stuff. Pure revenge and silliness to boot.Kill Bill Vol.2 was really, really average. I found myself feeling completely uninvolved. Bill's script was unwieldy and lacked any real substance. Michael Madsen's character history had no place in the film. I agree with someone else's comments about the film needing to be 20 minutes shorter or so.I can't say I'll be in a rush to watch the second part, but would happily view the first one again.I've have to give this a 5 out of 10.",5,0,1,2 September 2004
