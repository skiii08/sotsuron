It," A killer clown awakens from his twenty seven year sleep to terrorize the kid of Derry.
",The acting over all was really good but i wish they hadn't marketed it as so scary you wont sleep for months. When going into this i thought i was gonna get a really good scare but in all reality i found that it would work better as a dark comedy instead. However there was a few good jump scares but i found that sometimes the CGI looked weird. There was some hidden gestures to characters and scenes from the book but in all they left a lot of the book out. Im hoping for more of parts from the book in chapter two of the movie.,8,3,5,19 September 2017
