Vertigo," Showing its age?
","I'm not sure if it is the film or me showing age, but somehow this movie just doesn't pack as much wallop as many of Hitchcock's other movies. Perhaps I've seen it too often and my familiarity with the film is in he process of breeding a degree of contempt.Technically, the film is beautiful. San Francisco, ever the photogenic backdrop, provides one glorious setting after another. The score superbly captures the pent-up emotions of the characters as the story unfolds. From there, however, problems begin.As the reviewer 'jrbleau' noted, the film suffers from a rather implausible set of circumstances. Rather than repeat 'jrbleau's' synopsis, just this one example will suffice.'Scottie' is supposed to be an experienced police detective, but his powers of detection seem none too sharp in the plot line. I find it pretty hard to believe that he didn't actually figure out that 'Judy Barnes' was 'Madeline' until she actually puts on 'Carlotta's necklace.' Perhaps we are supposed to chalk that up to the overwhelming infatuation/obsession he feels toward 'Madeline,' but Kim Novak's portrayal of the character does not provide a sufficient spark to carry the day on that score. Their encounters before the first all from the mission tower are really quite bland. Scottie doesn't seem to be overwhelmed by her at all -- just mildly interested.This remains a fine film, but somewhat overrated in the overall context of Hitchcock's body of work.",7,1,4,28 December 2004
Ocean's Twelve," Smug and cutesy all at once
","I wanted to like this film, I really did. The remake of the old Rat Pack vehicle, Oceans Eleven, was nicely done. There was a compact feel to it and some elegant twists and turns of plot that made for an entertaining escapist movie.In contrast, Oceans Twelve feels bloated, stumbling along with no apparent point in mind. Worse, there's far too much explanation going on. It has been said that if you have to explain a joke, the joke was a dud. Oceans Twelve proves that the same theory holds true for movies. Since the script was perhaps trying to do too many things at once, there was a need to resort to extensive flashbacks to explain what should have been key plot points. Apparently no one wanted to work hard enough to weave those plot points into the script, so they resorted to Gilligan's Island-style flashbacks to reveal key pieces of information that would have made the story much more coherent had those bits of information simply been given to us in the first place.That would have entailed some deft script-writing and, again, it doesn't seem like anyone other than Catherine Zeta-Jones and Matt Damon wanted to work that hard in this film. George Clooney and Brad Pitt spend most of their time on screen trying to out-smirk each other. I'd smirk a lot too if I was being to do as little as each did in this movie.The most annoying bit of contrivance was the ever-so-cutey-pie idea of having Tess Ocean, played by Juila Roberts, of course, pretend to be Julia Roberts. I guess that gave them an excuse to let Bruce Willis add a few smirks of his own to the story.In well-done 'con' movies, like The Sting or even the Oceans Eleven remake, the viewer is pulled into the heist and knows enough about the con being pulled to enjoy seeing it unfold. In Oceans Twelve, the heist becomes secondary at best, with the story of the actual heists told in flashbacks. From the flashbacks it looks as if they had the makings of a pretty good sequel, but instead of telling us the story of the heist,we got a weak episode of the old TV show 'It Takes a Thief.' Perhaps most annoying feature of this movie were the painfully obvious teases for yet another sequel. When that comes out, I'll pass, but I do have a suggestion. Since they spent so much time telling the story of Oceans Twelve in plot-repairing or plot-supplying flashbacks, why not just tell us how they pulled the heist so that I don't have to sit through two hours of fluff to get there.Mediocre at best.",Null,7,10,21 January 2005
The Godfather: Part II," Sequel + Prequel = monumental film-making
","Francis Ford Coppola came perilously close in this film to accomplishing something rarely, if ever, done: he nearly made the second movie revolving around a particular set of characters and themes better than the first.In the truest sense of the word, Godfather II is NOT a sequel, nor was it intended to be. What Part II does is fill in details about Don Vito Corleone's arrival in America and rise to underworld power. That story was told by Mario Puzo in the novel, but involved too lengthy a story to include in the 1972 film. Coppola and Puzo did the next best thing: they told the prequel, the rise to power of Don Vito Corleone (Robert DeNiro) and then appended to the prequel the story of the Corleone family subsequent to Michael's gangland triumph at the close of the first film. 'Appended' should not be taken to have a pejorative connotation. There is certainly nothing slapdash about the tale of the Corleone family's fortunes following the obliteration of the rival gang leaders at the end of the first film.Al Pacino is stunningly believable as the still-reluctant Don Michael Corleone. He wants to move the family business toward legitimacy, but in the end events compel him to 'be strong for everyone' by taking down all of the family's enemies, even when one of them is his older brother Fredo (John Cazale, again brilliant).Unlike the first film, Coppola does not pull off the same level of audience empathy for the Corleone family in the second film. Clearly the life of the crime boss is costing Michael everything while he gains all the power in the world. The first film is more equivocal on that point and also remarkably draws the viewer into a world where the Corleones can be viewed with some empathy. In Part II, Michael is far more cold-blooded and consequently a less sympathetic character. He seems less drawn into the vortex of organized crime by unexpected events, as was the case in the first film, and more the ruthless manipulator.This is really two great films in one. Vito Corleone's rise to power is portrayed with subtle intensity by DeNiro, always observant and always absorbing important information from his observations. Those scenes really capture remarkably the story of Don Vito's early years woven by Puzo in the novel. Wrapped around that prequel is a marvelous continuation of the original story with remarkable twists and turns and deft uses of historical circumstances (Congressional racketeering hearings and the Castro revolution in Cuba). This is another magnificent film, and fitting second step in the Godfather story.Don't end the story with the first Godfather movie. See them both. As for Godfather 3, well, if you really want to go ahead, but be prepared for a let down.",10,8,12,10 February 2005
The Caine Mutiny," Queeg Agonistes
","Watching this film, I found it rather easy to imagine Humphrey Bogart not playing Captain Queeg, but instead playing Richard Nixon mulling over his enemies list in lieu of the most likely suspects to have pilfered the strawberries. Bogart's intensity here is brilliant as he caroms back and forth between discipline-oriented naval officer and frightened paranoiac. His meltdown in the witness chair is one of the more memorable court-room scenes in cinematic history. While Bogie is the main event here, Jose Ferrer turns in an outstanding performance as the defense attorney. Fred McMurray is also tremendous in the role of the real 'Yellow Stain,' Tonm Keefer. I find it fascinating that one of TV's most innocuous 60's sitcoms dads played morally deficient characters in his two best film roles (the second being the amoral Walter Neff in 'Double Indemnity'). There is no mistaking, however, that this film belongs to Bogart.",9,2,5,12 April 2009
Cold Mountain," Dull Mountain
","Romance tales are not my cup of tea, but sometimes we do what we have to and go see them anyway. My wife had read the novel and wanted to see the film, so I went along for the Civil War scenes.I am a Civil War buff. I have tromped around on battlefields, visited Lincoln sites and toured museums. I've read most of the best of what is out there to be read on the subject, and I have to say, Anothnoy Minghella admirably captured the battle scenes depicting the slaughter in the 'crater' portion of the battle of Cold Harbor. He also displayed a deft touch with the more subtle concept that by 1864, the Confederate army were becoming increasingly disenchanted at the idea that they could win the war.Consequently, many did simply head for home, hoping that there was still a home to get to when they got there. Those are the two things Minghella did very well. That's where he earned most of the five points on the IMDb scale that I gave this film.Beyond that, this movie seemed to take days to tell a story that can be summed up in three sentences. Inman (Jude Law) is fed up with the war and wants to go hone and consummate his love for Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman). On the way he encounters hardships, acts of courage, acts of cowardice and the like while Ada battles with the help of some unlikely allies to keep from dying herself. Finally Inman gets home, makes to love Ada, and then he dies.Jude Law turned in a credible performance as the soldiers' soldier, Inman. Renee Zellweger was entertaining as Ada's friend and companion (lover?) Ruby Thewes. Phillip Seymour Hoffman turned in a nice performance as the cad, Rev. Veasey. Otherwise the performances were certainly not horrible; the cast was solid and portrayed the broad brush characters they were given to portray with reliable predictability. As for Nicole Kidman, I never for a moment believed that she was on the brink of starvation after her father (portrayed with a kind of bemused indifference by Donald Suterland) died. People on the brink of starvation are not perfectly groomed with meticulously combed hair, fluorescent white teeth and not a callous on her hands. I suppose it's not her fault that that the director and make-up people were unable to suppress her natural beauty, but she never looked to be suffering from anything more than mild discomfort. As is often the case with 'Hollywood' productions, the people are just a little too pretty to be believed.The whole purpose of the movie seemed to be to get to the torrid love scene between Inman and Ada, followed hard by his death. I hope the journey was worth it for Inman; it certainly wasn't for me.",5,7,15,18 February 2005
JFK," A bad high school term paper
","The problem with this film is that while Oliver Stone continually ducks behind the curtain defending himself that he was only making a work of fiction, he uses enough historical imagery and data that the end product is as I have described it in the 'one line description:' a bad history term paper. I'll not recount the historical inaccuracies that permeate the film concerning the individuals involved save to note that attempting to make a hero of Jim Garrison would be laughable if the reputations otherwise damaged in the film did not belong to real people. I would encourage anyone who believes that the character Kevin Costner portrayed bore any philosophical or intellectual similarity to Jim Garrison should read a biography of Garrison some time. he knew he had no case, he knew his 'star witness' was perjuring himself. but the call to glory was too great for Garrison to let those 'little inconveniences' get in his way. The real life Jim Garrison ultimately lost his case against Clay Shaw and Stone loses his case as well by attempting to glue together a variety of conspiracy theories, many of which had been debunked long before the release of the film in 1991. The problem, however, is that those theories are presented in 'JFK' as historical verities, and large numbers of viewers haven't the historical grounding in the facts of the assassination and the scores of investigations conducted since to know where Stone is taking 'artistic license' and the actual facts of the case. The result is that actual people end up being smeared by innuendo and 'factual evidence' long since discredited.",5,17,39,22 November 2004
The Godfather: Part III," Went to the well once too often
","This film is a poor shadow of its two monumental predecessors. It is more a run-of-the-mill sequel (read: pale imitation of the predecessor) than another film in the great tradition of the first two Godfather films.Admittedly, this film had gigantic footsteps in which to follow. Sadly, it doesn't come remotely close to following them. Al Pacino gives a solid if uninspired performance as the aging Michael Corleone. (He was saving his intensity for Scarface, I suppose.) The other performances are flat. Worse, the story lines seem generally less plausible. Part of what made the first two films so effective was the more or less close parallels to actual underworld events. This story did not succeed at that project.I suppose that seeing this version completed the full circle, but I did not need to see Michael's daughter (Sophia Coppola) take a bullet intended for him to get the idea that the gangster life had cost Michael everything he held dear. Part II completed that part of the saga with tremendous insight and subtle power. I did not need to be hit over the head with the idea in Part III.The movie is not a total dog, but it is not in the same league as the first two -- not by a long shot.",6,1,3,10 February 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Bye now, don't hurry back
","Way back when the first Star Wars film was released, I recall a friend telling of reading that George Lucas's vision was for a 9 part opus. The three 'middle' episodes first, with Luke and Leia and Han, etc.; followed by the prequel to the original three, also in three installments; and, then, the three concluding episodes that pick up the story from the end of 'Return of the Jedi.' Let us hope that anyone who was ever entertaining that idea has long since had a change of heart.'Revenge' was an improvement over the child-oriented 'Phantom Menace' and the abysmal 'Clone Wars.' Damnation with faint praise was never more appropriate.Everyone of course knew what the ultimate outcome of the film was going to be for Annakin and Obi-Wan and Yoda and a number of other characters (i.e. we knew from having seen the original film that Annakin/Darth's kids would be born and grow to be adults, that Obi Wan would teach Annakin/Darth's son, etc.). Thus, the screenwriter faced something of a dilemma in trying to maintain some level of suspense as to exactly how all those characters survived for what is now regarded as 'Episode IV,' or what I will always think of simply as 'Star Wars.' The cast had the potential to be capable of pulling off that difficult transition, but the script made it quite difficult. As another reviewer pointed out, even the scene that everyone knew was coming, when Annakin donned the mask that kids have been wearing for Halloween for nearly thirty years now, fell flat as a week-old bottle of open ginger ale. For a film where that kind of story line is carried off by the actors and the screenwriter, see 'Godfather 2.' Everyone watching knew that young Vito Corleone would become the head of an organized crime family, but the telling of the story was nonetheless brilliantly subtle both in terms of the scripting and the portrayals by the actors.The series is tired. It is time to let it rest. It is time to let the box set DVDs of all six episodes come out. And who knows, maybe a long, long time from now in a galaxy far, far away, it will be time for someone to try to pick up the story where 'Episode VI' ends.",3,17,34,31 May 2005
Saboteur," Lightweight Hitch
","This film is bogged down by some mediocre acting (Robert Cummings in the lead, Priscilla Lane as the love interest) and some below-average writing. Hitchcock does play with some camera work that will pop up later in better pictures -- most notably people dangling perilously from national landmarks and a man pictured falling from a great height. Unfortunately, the story gets downright silly in places, with people inexplicably popping up in and out of captivity. Curiously, we are told at one point that Frank Fry's hiding place in Soda City is 'up north' (i.e., Northern California), but when we and Cummings find Soda City, it's situated with a fine view of Hoover Dam, on the Arizona-Nevada border. The police allow a bit too much activity by Cummings and Lane in the climactic scenes of the film, when the authorities and presumably trying to round up the saboteurs, to be plausible. Still, there are enough deft Hitchcock touches to prevent the film from being a total disaster. This one may not even be in Hitchcock's top 50, but it's not a bad little diversion.",5,6,10,12 April 2009
The Godfather," Simply extraordinary
","That two word summary captures my bottom line feelings about this film: simply extraordinary.This is, of course, Francis Ford Coppola's greatest film achievement to date. I frankly doubt that he, or anyone else, can surpass this film, although he gave it a pretty good run in 'Godfather II.' Part of what sets this film apart is that Coppola took one very well known star in Marlon Brando and surrounded him with an ensemble of lesser known actors. The result is that many of those lesser knowns were catapulted into stardom themselves, particularly Al Pacino (Michael Corleone) and Diane Keaton (Kay Adams). John Cazale is perfectly cast is the ignored middle child, Fredo Corleone, and James Caan turns in a memorable performance as the hot-tempered Santino 'Sonny' Corleone.The subtle undertow of this film is that Coppola and Mario Puzo crafted a brilliant script that draws the viewer into a level of empathy with a family of cold-blooded killers. The Corleones are, after all, a family under siege after the surprise attack on the Don, the abduction of Tom Hagen (Duvall) and the murder of the Don's most trusted assassin, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana). The family draws closer, with the estranged son, Micahel, returning to rescue the family business from chaos. It becomes easy to lose sight of the fact that Coppola has the audience 'rooting' for one set of ruthless murderers over the other set.The climax of the film occurs when Michael orchestrates the final revenge of the family for the murder attempt against his father, the murder of Sonny, the physical abuse of his sister, the abuse of Fredo and disrespect shown for the Corleone family in Las Vegas, the murder of his Sicilian wife, and against the traitor within the family business. Those scenes are controversial on many levels, not least of which was the juxtaposition of a number of the murders with the baptism of Michael's nephew.This film is a masterpiece of movie-making. You owe it to yourself to see it.",10,1,3,8 February 2005
