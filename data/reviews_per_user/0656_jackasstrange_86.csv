Scarface," Voracious and extremely over the top, yet manages to be an intelligent film
","Not a big fan of Brian DePalma, but this one just blew me away. He did one of the worst homages i've seen for Psycho with his horrible 'Dressed to Kill' in 1980, but that one, Scarface, compensates every mediocre moment i had to pass through the aforementioned film. Scarface, hated by some and loved by others in the 80s for being utterly violent and for being the most controversial and shocking film produced in Hollywood to the date, divided critics, the audience and even the people who works doing films. While the director Martin Scorsese said 'I love it', the actor Dustin Hoffman said 'I fell asleep' and the division went for a long while. Obviously all the hate for it being so 'over the top' passed, because every year since then there is a film with even more profanities, violence and drug use coming out. But yeah, it still shocking. The only reason it is not worth a NC- 17 is because some effects actually looks very cheap and fake, so it inevitably affects the impact of the film over nowadays viewers. But again, the overuse of profanities will upset those who are easily offended.This film is, after all, a reflexion about what ambition can brings, but it's not a moralist tale at all, and despite being over the top, it's possible to see a bit of truth on it.Al Pacino is superb as Tony Montana. The impulsive and totally unpredictable crazy drug- dealer. I simply loved him in that role. I also found interesting the editing and art direction. Some strong contrasts, specifically in the 'hot colors' (red,orange), used remarkably in a bright white ambient. Interesting choice. The cinematography looks very campy. The zoom in the 'Party Scene' was almost amateur. But i didn't have major problems with it, and neither with the 80s typical beats that were played constantly.Watch this film. 9.2/10",9,0,2,27 December 2013
Captain Phillips," Big disappointment!
","I was going to watch Captain Phillips with the lowest expectations possible, since I really not liked Paul Greengrass previous works such as the Bourne's trilogy, but I really don't bother about it at all, after all, who knows, right? The film may be a masterpiece or a piece of garbage, but knowing which is which requires you to watch the film. And gosh, that was very bad. At least, compared to the hype given. OK, the performances were good in the film, specifically by Hanks, who clearly show what he came for in the final moments, but overall the film it's pretty mediocre. The script looks like it's following some kind of protocol. The character development looks like something made by someone making a online study, given the level of amateurish. The viewer just know the entire thing that Captain Phillips has a wife which he likes, kids and of course, he is a captain with a considerable level of experience. That's all. I wonder if it is, nowadays, everything the viewer expect from a character. He is so one dimensional that it's impossible to care about him or whatever. In fact, I just disliked the villains more than him, but these were the characters more close to real life as possible, since they had a noble cause to fight for. Yet, the way they are developed made they looks like just as one-dimensional characters as the captain. Not counting that story-telling aspect is abysmal, the story simply didn't go ahead and most of the first 70 minutes or so were pointless. It's just boring. I almost feel bad for Hanks, because he did really well in a story that really isn't good or even average. It's bad. Plain bad.The cinematography was terrible in my opinion. I have nothing against shaky cameras and zoom-in-and-out, but in this film they are used like every time, and in my opinion they weren't needed at all and just worse the situation of the film, that is already overall weak. But fine, a good thing about it. I have no complaints about one of my favorite criteria when judging a film, the art direction. I liked a lot the night ambient and definitely it adds a needed ton of realism to the film. But isn't good enough to save this film from being a total fiasco.My final rating: 5.5/10",5,10,20,17 January 2014
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," May have been good in the 80s...but not anymore.
","E.T, a so-called great film by Steven Spielberg. Is a kids film, fact. But is not only a kids film, is a kids film that is considered one of the greatest films of all-time, acclaimed critically and a great success on the box office...wow, right?No, no really. This film may have been good in the time it was released, I mean, there are a lot of '80s values' on it, and I understand, it talks about the 'magic' of the childhood...but, it talked strictly for the 80s generation, I mean, for an older and different audience, there is simply no way to connect with this film at all. It's dull, outdated, and totally uninteresting. The characters are shallow, so I couldn't care less for them. And again, very dull. The film is about kids doing dull things, so despite the story being technically perfect for the 80s standards, nowadays it's just a boring film with nothing to offer for the newer audiences.I also disliked the soundtrack. So annoying and sketch. It was used in the film to.attenuate the scenes, and it don't worked anytime. And I almost walked out in the most bizarrely manipulative moment of the film, the ending, much because of the John Williams horrible music.The E.T is very similar to the weird baby in Eraserhead(David Lynch, 1978), I found this detail pretty interesting. But all in all, not deserving of it's classic status. 5.0/10",5,3,9,15 February 2014
In Bruges," Best comedy film of the last decade
","In Bruges is perhaps the funniest and also the smartest comedy film that came out in 2008, and without a doubts the best comedy film of the last decade. The cinematography is fantastic, widely superior than your conventional comedy film. The shots from Bruges are just incredible and breath taking. Stunning as well is the music, composed by Carter Buwell. Fine tracks which fits well into the film's atmosphere.The plot is also very peculiar. It has some dramatic and silly moments, and i must say that it don't has a perfect balance between the extremes, and it suddenly may go from suicide sequences to a discussion about a war between black dwarfs and white dwarfs. It's crazy. This probably was the intention of the author, mixing Greek tragedy with the extremely silly and comic situations. It's weird, and it worked. Absolutely worked.And as said previously, In Bruges is a very smart film. The plot has a very deep content and explores in a fine way, subjects as the religiosity and will to live. Will to live in fact, is what moves this film. It's possible to see the irony in the events this film presents, such as the fact that when Farrel's character wants to die, he is completely safe, but when he finally is dying, he starts to will his life. This irony in fact, is what makes this film so great in my opinion. Forget all the idiocy of the characters, the tragedy aspects and the fact that it is a well made film technically. This film is great because of the irony. The irony of the life. Fantastic. And of course, Colin did pretty well his here In Bruges, and deservedly won the golden globe for his effort. The entire cast did well, including the racist dwarf.A must watch film, 9.5/10",9,0,3,27 November 2013
Gravity," The 'cast away' in the space
","Well I just came here to tell that Gravity is not that great as an 'overall film' at all. I mean, it is flawless, but it is way too simple and unoriginal. It's basically another film of people trapped in somewhere. In fact, it looks perfectly like 'Apollo 13'(Ron Howard,1996). It's another 'mission impossible' kind of film, and that's really reaching the limit of the overusing. It has an existential conflict(I guess?) going on during a part of the film, a small part in fact, but it's perhaps serving to excuse for apologists to defend the lack of any depth or whats ever in the film, with arguments like 'well there is some philosophy on here'. Personally,I think there's no problem in being unoriginal at all, even because it's really hard to be 100%original nowadays, but, there is a problem in being 'a lot' unoriginal. It's the 'boring' factor. I mean, a great screenwriter once said 'If you are doing a predictable film, a film that will make audiences thinking in all the end possibilities, you already failed' well, I think it's a extreme line, but in part, it's completely true. It was obvious that she was going to 'survive' in the end or die in a tragic way, so no surprise at all anyways. Perhaps, there are always distractions in the film trying to make you think that the film is going to another way when in the reality, it's not. Most visually distractions, and admittedly it did catch me a few times, mesmerized by some stunning scenes an by the allegory presented. But it didn't worked always, pretty much the opposite. All the dramatic situations came way too forced. Survive after all the chaos looked even inevitably after all, in fact. In this aspect it look alike 'Cast Away', yeah that's right, the film with Tom Hanks, that can't escape from the island due to the chaos that always hit him, but you somehow knows that he was going to escape in the end. It's in that way Gravity follows.Technically, it's a strong film. Cinematography it's top notch, the editing is a great contender for wins, I mean, I loved the balance of the slowly paced scenes with the fast paced ones. Thought the editors did a very good job indeed. The sound editing also fantastic again, it's a great film in these technical aspects.The acting? Meh. Very average. All Sandra Bullock did was yelling during the most intense scenes, and making nervous faces. It was without any kind of intensity. I don't think I need to mention Clooney, because he did even less than Bullock. Maybe a bit more of emotion and intensity could've improved a lot my impression about this film. Well, that's my review, and my rating it's 7.2/10. Fair.",7,0,1,10 January 2014
Memento," A dazzling, great and exciting thriller; perhaps the greatest film ever done
","Director Christopher Nolan become known as doing great films, but all this respect that he has nowadays can be given to two films: The Dark Knight, which makes his fame, and Memento, back in the earlier 00s, which make his name. Memento is a class of story-telling, a piece of art. It's a film that you want to watch again and again, because is really that good. This film has some kind of glue, once watched about ten minutes or so, you won't stop. Why? Well, firstly, because the way the story is told. I don't want to enter in details; after all, spoilers really can ruin this film at first watch.But I can say that IF the goal of the film is make the viewer really feel the character's mind to the point of being confusing while watching the film, I can say that they did very well the job. It's a great puzzle, and the pieces are given in a way that sometimes you think in a way, but then there is another piece given, and you simply change completely your thoughts. Then fine, you think the story is finally going ahead. But, somehow, there is yet a piece missing in the story, and there is when you realize you got completely involved in the story and your mind starts to become confused. I've never been so excited for a film as much as i did when watching Memento. I've watched films with very powerful twists, and films with a very well told story, but in that film, there is like a combo of these two aspects and sure I've never seen nothing like that. It's the best thriller film that I've watched, enough said.Leonard's quest is so unpredictable, and its even more attenuated with the fact that not only the story has no chronological order, but also with the fact that the story is inter called with another moment of Leonard's life(the sequences which happens in that inter called reality is entirely made in black and white). There is also some of Nolan's trademarks in this film. The slight dark humor in the action scenes and the twists in the end which he became known for are two of them.Once the cinematic puzzle that this film is gets completed, you realize how pessimist and cruel the film is. The ending is unpredictable, and certainly on par with the buildup made, but it don't leaves anything to be thought or whats or ever. There are really no questions to be asked. This is what is so great about it. Despite being apparently a film with lots of layers, the message that it wants to pass is only one – and is very clever. A metaphor about life, and again, not an optimistic one. And as far as the world looks, this metaphor is – how can I say that? It makes no sense! But okay, I'll try. The metaphor is true. Yes, true. Unfortunately. Obviously, I'll not spoil it, otherwise the entire film would be useless and the experience wouldn't be as great as if you know what this metaphor is beforehand, again, and worthy noting to say: don't look for spoilers about this film. It will ruin it. I've no fear to say that Memento is THE greatest film that I've ever watched, and I expect it to be recognized as the greatest piece of art made in that century. 10/10 #1 on my list of all time favorites",10,2,5,22 January 2014
This Is the End," Idiocy Reigns Supreme
","I have no words to describe this film. I mean, seriously? It's awfully pathetic and idiotic, and probably the most ridiculous effort yet that I've seen in that 'Judd Apatow' kind of comedy. What can be said in a review about this film, anyway? I could've been talking detailed how idiotic is the scene where James Franco and Danny McBride are mimicking that they were throwing sperm in each other, and how stupid the idea of playing a Whitney Houston song while Seth Rogen was being saved, was cheesy and ridiculous, but I realized that it would be a pointless exercise, simply because I would be pointing the obvious. The goal of that film is being as absurd and ridiculous as possible, so anything said as critic would be pointless as well. It's hilarious. So let's make it simple. No review at all. I just want to say that sometimes it's forced and really looks lame, but that is the intention. I think the world is starting to accept that kind of stupid comedy and that is what is worrying me. It's hilarious anyway. 5.4/10",5,2,5,17 January 2014
Argo," Slightly better than Zero Dark Thirty... but still a weak film
","Argo is alongside Zero Dark Thirty the most undeserving and weakest films in the Oscars, and is not hard to understand why. As i already made a review about the horrible Zero Dark, i will make a review about this one now, explaining how it also was a fail film.Argo is a generic film when it comes to the cinematography subject, subject that i highly appreciate and definitely adds a lot of meanings and expands the limits of any film. If well utilized, of course. So, -1 point. The soundtrack is barely noticeable, but i guess that this kind of film has no business in that aspect anyways.The plot is pretty average. The dialogs are ridiculous sometimes, no offenses. A quick and effective example would be the analogy made by Affleck's character in the reunion table, near the beginning of the film, comparing his mission with an abortion. That was proud of universal sorriness. Definitely ridiculous_ again, no offenses_. Some events are ridiculously dramatized as well. In that aspect, it is very similar to his fellow film about CIA in the year, because both of them depicts the agents doing seriously anti- professionalism actions which threatened lives of people. That is something that wont happen in real life. No way a so carefully managed corporation as CIA would allow his employees to act in such a passionate way. A example would be Brian Cranston and Affleck's characters, who contributed to the rescue of the refugees simply by doing stupid emotional decisions. That is ridiculous. Also, the constant TV news popping out and fading almost every time were super annoying. It looked like the film was trying constantly to remind us how it was based in true Informations and how it has historical receipts. That was pretty stupid, and prejudiced the film.I do not recommend this film, it don't adds nothing that you can't found out for yourself in a fast research in wikipedia. 6.0/ 10",6,1,2,1 December 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," Flawed Masterpiece? Well, it's great for sure
","I kinda like Star Trek: Into the Darkness. It's a complete film overall, because i mean, it's very entertaining, the story is indeed good, it has really very cool scenes, as a surprisingly almost touching dialog between Spocky and Kirk, near the end of the film, and also very beautiful shots of the space, however the special effects in the spaceships were not cool at all(a crime, if you consider the amount of money spent on the film just for that subject). The work on cinematography is good for sure, with some J.J Abrams frenetic 'single shot scenes' trademark in it. It has a few logic problems for sure, but nothing that really prejudiced the flow of the story. A quick example would be the fact that Kirk never listens to Spocky always right advices. This is really an idiotic and annoying fact, and if you not suspend your disbelief you really tend to not enter in the film at all. Apart from that, i really liked this film. It's so entertaining that the 130 minutes looked more as a half hour film. Some people have complaints about Khan being portrayed by a white dude(for those who don't knows, Khan is an Indian in the original Star Trek series). Well, i didn't mind for that little fact, 1) because i haven't watched the original Star Trek series, so i don't know if this 'race detail' is important for the build-up of the character or not. And 2), because i don't give a dawn about races 'truthful' portrayal in films or that kind of stuff. So, if you have an open mind and a bit suspension of disbelief, Star Trek may turn into a good film for you. Personally, recommended. 8.8/10",9,2,4,23 November 2013
The Secret in Their Eyes," The 'A' is missing
","The secret of your eyes is certainly a good film. The plot really can involves the viewer, but what i appreciated even more than the thriller was the subtle meanings and a couple of philosophical questions brought. For example, the drunken friend of the protagonist couldn't have used cleverest words when he made analogies and metaphors to explain that what really moves the persons is the will, the passion, the love, don't matters what you do love. The protagonist apparently loved the woman, and all his actions about his past just happens because he was moved by the love. The allegory of the 'A' is missing is really, though it is perhaps more understandable for those who have Spanish as first language. I mean, i was kinda lost about the meaning of the word 'Temo' but it was quickly solved by a research on a dictionary. The acting is indeed very good, Ricardo Darín is perhaps a good actor, and the entire cast did a good job. About the villains, they did very well their jobs and reached their objectives, that were being hated by the viewer.The antagonist was a very unlikable and arrogant character, and the murderer is really nasty. And not mentioning the fact that this film has perhaps one of the weirdest and most ambiguous twists in film that i've ever seen. Anyways, it's obviously worth a watch. 8.5/ 10",8,0,1,26 November 2013
Hot Fuzz," **** just got real!!!!
","Hot Fuzz is awesome. English humor in general is kinda weird (nowadays at least), since that it mostly consists in making fast jokes that are quickly cut in a weird editing, so it definitely don't appeals for me. But, somehow this filmmade me laugh. It's genuinely funny and above all – original – even if it's a parody. Yeah, It's more a satire than anything else, but still being a parody with personality. I mean, you just realize it's a mocking film after the first 40 minutes, that weren't that good in my opinion, but it shows the development of the film. I didn't like it mostly because of the fast and unfunny apparently 'nonsense' gags that suddenly appeared out of nowhere – I thought, worthy noting -, but then I realized that the gags and everything weren't nonsense at all. That was the funniest part about it. As a parody, it mocks the American action/thriller films in general. Being said, my first impression by Edgar Wright wasn't one of the best. I really didn't like the Cult-film 'Scott Pilgrim', it was way too messy and forced, but Hot Fuzz conquered me. In fact, I think it's one of the greatest comedies of the last decade. Really worth checking out. 7.9/10",8,0,0,10 January 2014
Brokeback Mountain," One of the very best of 2005
","Brokeback Mountain has a very original and well-made story. Two Cowboys being lovers during 20 years is really original. Although the same formula of the script of this film could've used to depict a straight couple. I mean, the story don't fit exclusively and only in a 'gay' universe. It's not something that would happen exclusively to homosexuals. And if we think well, there is no conflict, or at least a decent one, which treats of their homosexuality in relation to the other people, what is in fact, very surprising. Generally, 'gay themed' films tend to explore the relation of the gays being often in conflict with the society. But OK, that was the film intention anyways, so i just can cheer the production of the film for a nearly flawless romance film. Because technically it's a great film. Wonderful shots of the 'Brokeback Mountain', which looks dread and full of life at the same time. Is just weird, but beautiful...in a way. The soundtrack is not bad either, but i disliked some of the cheesy 'love' songs which started to play every time when the situation becomes way too melodramatic. That ruined the film a little for me. I found them to be way too annoying.And very inspired performances by all the leads. Heath Ledger is,once again, fantastic. This was arguably his second best acting performance in the career, just behind the obvious first place... So yeah, Brokeback Mountain is a beautiful film and deserves a watch. 7.7/10",8,3,3,11 November 2013
Crash," Style over zero substance mixed with unrealistic racism conflicts
","While I admire Crash for raising to the glpry with so little budget(6.5 million was spent to make this film), and how well the money was spent in editing and FX, the film as a whole is disturbingly B level(apart from a few members of the cast, obviously, Sandra Bullock and all)and not deserved at all it's Best Picture win. It has an abominable script. Period. It doesn't matter if it won various screenplay awards or not. It's terrible. Screenplay's teachers often say that the dialogs are irrelevant - well, in a commercial point of view, yes; but awards-wise, the story is(or should be) completely other. Crash obviously wasn't nowhere near of having the best screenplay of it's year.And still, Crash has some of the dullest, forced dialogs that I've ever heard, and often they involved racism. Yes. It was so unrealistic that I couldn't help but laugh. It was hilarious. It was so bad that it makes James Cameron screenplays looks like Shakespeare plays in comparison. Is just ridiculous.The character development is another thing I strongly disliked. For a film that wants to be so 'emptionally involving', the characters are just pathetic. I couldn't care any less for what was happening, and again, I just observed with a smirk on the face all the hilarious attempts of the film to make emotional contriving situations, because really, It was awful, forced and completely unrealistic. But yes, the music and the flashy editing are two things to be appreciated in the film. Matt Dillon acting is good, actually, and the film's pace isn't bad, the film always goes ahead, so it wasn't a boring experience. The editing, in fact, was the only aspect that truly deserved awards. The rest, forgettable and average at best.I think this film is not worth of your time at all, certainly one of the worst Oscar winners of all time. 5.9/10",6,2,2,15 February 2014
Alien," Average spacecraft thriller.
","I never was a big fan of the Alien series. Always thought that they were way too dumb. However, i've never watched the very first one; the one which started everything, the original Alien. Until today. And to be honest, i am a bit disappointed. It's a very well made film, even more for the standards of 1979, but to the story itself...well, i just don't care for it at all. Sure, the film has great visuals, the spacecraft is full of interesting details, but the story is dry. The character development is not adequate at all, and this is an aspect which i consider fundamental in any film. We don't have any deep idea of who are the persons in there, or what they were doing, or what they are going to do. Then, the thriller? Almost none. And it's not scary. To the well of the truth, almost all the times the 'scariest' moments were very predictable and even unintentionally comic.But nice. It's a classic, right? Well, personally, i don't give a dawn. Because besides the fact that it is an extremely well made thriller with an Alien as the main villain , It has nothing more to add. Maybe it was very good back in the 70s and 80s, but not anymore. 7.3/ 10",7,9,19,2 November 2013
Taxi Driver," Scorsese's best
","Taxi Driver is a film that marked the start of the 'modern filmmaking'. Scorsese, in fact, still haven't done anything as good as 'Taxi Driver' or 'Raging Bull' yet, not coincidentally both came in his earlier filmmaking years. 'Taxi Driver' is not much different than Scorsese's recent works, it has the vulgarity and the dirty life in the streets as focus, but differently than films like 'Goodfellas' and recently 'The Wolf of Wall Street', 'Taxi is done with an artistic approach, instead of just a thin paper of vulgarities translated for the screen. The most interesting thing about this film, is the character development. You really want to hate the driver, because is admittedly a despicable, antisocial, racist crazy freak. But we are so near to him all the time that's virtually impossible. We feel sorry for him, but never hate him. He believe in what he believes, and the viewer knows and understand why, despite him being wrong. That is really interesting. Somehow, you can forgive all his faults. Then he tries to establish a relation with a woman, and in the beginning they do relatively well with each other, judging by the circumstances of their meeting, but quickly he realizes that she is way too different of her(in his head, he thinks that she is as dirty as the rest of the world). He became even more upset after that 'big' disappointment, even because he really don't likes the 'dirty' people. and by 'dirty' he refers to prostitutes, bandits, people that works and have a social life, and the most controversial of all: he hates 'blacks'. He is racist, noteworthy. And a completely antisocial person, but that is easily assumable.His 'rage' against the world just grows more and more, and there is a point when he start to think about really f***** up stuff. He buy guns and then becomes to train and also mastering his abilities of 'hit-man'. He became determined to 'clean' the streets, but his thoughts never turn in actions. He just drive his taxi at night and then train with his weapons in the free-time, but never do nothing about it. I think this is an interesting concept, you know, about people who have fear to concrete his actions. Its an spot on metaphor, because this really happens, people which never create courage to do what he wants to. So, we all know that he isn't a crazy psycho, I mean, he still crazy, but we know that psychos don't hesitate, feel fear, or anything.But apart from the 'most interesting' thing, there is also the 'most important' thing about the film, who shall be understood. It's, after all, a harsh critic about those individuals that put the fault in everyone due to their condition, but not in themselves, and how this human beings are egocentric. Noteworthy, how the 'driver' behavior changed, after doing something he considered 'relevant' in his life. He simply became a cool person(apparently) after that. Is a fantastic metaphor, it's basically saying if people could do everything they wanted to, so they would be not upset about the world, that in their vision is being 'unfair' with them. Obviously, it's my point of view, can be refuted or accepted but will still a theory and my point of view. There is more thoughts about the film here than the content about the film itself, I guess, but I just think that's a film that it's content can't be told at all only with detailing about his components, how it was made etc., so a superficial review about the cinematography, the storyline and the direction, wouldn't be enough, in my opinion. It's a film that really left you thinking about it for a long time. It's rich in content, and open for various interpretations. Dawn, I don't even mentioned about the 'contradiction' idea, which is the base for the story of the driver. So, as you see, there is a lot of stuff in the film to be analyzed.So, yeah, I think that's a done review, perhaps it's a review targeted more for people who have watched the film, but it hasn't 'super spoilers' or something like that either. I didn't tell even half the story, so if you'll haven't watched it just yet and read my review, don't worry. You'll still enjoy it, for sure. Now, my rating is 9.5/10. One of Scorsese best, alongside Raging Bull, and It absolutely deserves it's 'classic status'. What more can I say? Watch this film.",9,0,0,13 January 2014
Life of Pi," One of the very best films of the XXI century
","Life of Pi is really one of the best films from this century, and is steps ahead of 'Crouching Tiger and Hidden Dragon', another great film, and also steps ahead of the 'Brokeback Mountain', the infamous but excellent drama about two cowboys lovers. The existential conflicts are always an interesting subject to put in film, and maybe this is why Life of Pi has the best character development that i've seen in a long while. The dialogs and thoughts of Pi about the religions, disbelieves and faith are so interesting and honest that this alone made me fascinated with this film. You can understand 'Pi', because his thoughts are relatable to anyone, or almost anyone, i suppose. Asking for the 'why' of life and if God exists or not is something inevitable for the great majority of people in the world. But unfortunately, it starts to lose this honest essence when Pi, born as a follower of the Hinduism, changes his religion for the Christianism. This was like a punch in the face, because really... It becomes clearly, at least for me, that this film was doing a Christianism propaganda. It becomes blatantly obvious, i must say. I don't believe in these myths, but i can realize how offensive this film may be for people from other religions, specifically for the followers of Hinduism. But i loved the allegory of Pi taking care of the Tiger and what it represented. He needed the tiger in order to survive. The Tiger represented 'the animal willing for his life', using his basic instincts to survive. As we can see in the end of the film, The Tiger was probably Pi himself, what explains absolutely everything. This is whyin the end there is no importance of which story was the true one, because in the end, both were true. They are just told in different ways..The cinematography is fantastic. One of the best that i've seen, top 5 for sure. It's breath taking, incredible and amazing, and it also is a big 'shut up' for the people which defends that CGI is taking the magic of cinema away. Life of Pi is the proof of why CGI can be used to turn the films even more powerful and fantastic than the traditional films which uses the 'practical effects' . The animals in the boat are extremely real.A must watch film, one of the very best of 2012. 9.5/10",9,1,3,1 December 2013
Barry Lyndon," Okay, certainly NOT one of the best films by Kubrick
","Damn, what a boring film. Shallow characters with no depth, and poor acting! The screenplay also sucks. I mean, WTF is that scene with Barry and his cousin? Looks like something you'd find in a porn film. The events on this film are so dumb and unbelievable, is a joke. It has great cinematography, I mean, very great. But so what? Is all meaningless. I would call it a style over substance kind of film, if it had any substance. Worst Kubrick film just behind Fear and Desire. Doesn't even looks like a Kubrick film. Too bad is so overrated nowadays. Still, its rather watchable after the first hour. But don't expect nothing above average apart from Kubrick's direction. The cinematography is indeed one of the greatest ever, if not the greatest. Is the only reason I can think of to watch this boring film.7/10",7,2,8,25 April 2014
Pacific Rim," Gaudy CGI and zero content
","Pacific Rim is an over the top film when the subject is and only is the special effects. It seems clear to me that it has a guaranteed Oscar nomination for the art direction achievement,and probably for Special Effects as well. However, in the other aspects, this film is just awful. If i gave a 4/10 score to this film, is all due to the technical aspects, i must say.The plot is hilariously bad constructed, and its first 20 minutes or so is one of the worst introductions to a film that i've ever watched. It spends this initial minutes with flashbacks which suddenly pops out and disappears, what is a clearly attempt of director Guillermo del Toro like of doing an economy of time to a possible very long but much likely most coherent and entertaining development. It also seems clear that if the producers of this film had some decency and weren't planning to just make a fast money over a relatively short attention span audience, they would give a decent development to Pacific Rim in a prequel film. Because dawn, the character development is bad. I couldn't care for the character that were in the screen, honestly. This was the main factor of why some people like me really didn't like this film. It don't assumes any compromises with the viewer, it don't involves the viewer. It just expect the viewer to sit and watch two hours of good special effects, without any plot or whats ever. It's really a shame.Even the so- called 'Super Hero' blockbusters puts effort in making a watchable film with an acceptable plot. So as you see, it is a very inferior film even for the popcorn flicks standards nowadays.I usually claim the films that uses much more the visual aspects instead of storytelling to be 'style over substance' kinds of films. But this one would be just style, since there is no substance or whatever to save it.Not recommended. 4.5/10",4,2,7,30 November 2013
Forrest Gump," Entertaining and uplifting film with a great and charismatic character, Zemeckis greatest work.
","Forrest Gump. Is simply impossible to dislike this film. While it don't has nothing groundbreaking or 'special' about it, is so...pleasant. Is a pleasure to watch this film, really. Is pleasant to the point of being almost a fault. If there is any film that deserves the title of 'greatest crowd-pleaser' , that one for sure is Forrest Gump. It's above all a story about happiness, overcoming, driven by a uplifting atmosphere and involving segments(the Vietnam, the famous ending, the president's meetings) and while it has a few dramatic moments, it never takes itself too seriously to the point of turning the moment in a 'manipulative mess, like some directors usually do. Forrest Gump, believe in it or not, is not a manipulative film. It flows naturally. Tom Hanks is spectacular here. He is brilliant as Forrest Gump, I honestly believed he was 'retarded'. All his child mannerisms were convincing. And the ending is so...great! He watching his kid entering in the bus, realizing that he would suffer the same troubles that himself passed through, is arguably the most heart-breaking scene in the entire film.Thiw film is not really...how can I say...well, Forrest Gump isn't really important for the filmmaking story, like Pulp Fiction is, for example , but still a very good film, regardless. You will not regret watching it. 8.5/10",8,1,1,15 February 2014
American Hustle," Insanely fun!
","American Hustle is establishing a sequence of good films by David O.Russel, the last two being also acclaimed by critics and received tons of nominations to great awards, but if one can be considered a masterpiece is American Hustle. The cast, I don't need to say, it's terrific. The main characters are interpreted by actors that are living a great momentum in Hollywood, and all of them being really really strong names. Bradley Cooper, is excellent as the Richie Dimaso, and as I really liked him a lot in his previous role with D.O Russel in Silver Linings Playbook, I hated him now. Jeremy Renner was terrific in Hurt Locker, and found success lately with the Avengers, but I liked him(surprise) a lot more in this film, and the mayor Carmine was one of my favorite characters. Amy Adams with a impressive streak of receiving five nominations to golden globes in less 7 years. That's great. She was in a lot of great stuff lately as well, my favorite of her acting efforts being in The Master. Jennifer Lawrence is the dearest of Hollywood and actually the most bankable actress in the world, don't know how that proceeds, but I really liked her in almost all the roles and really liked almost all the films she was in Christian Bale, no comments, because I don't think it's necessary at all. OK, one. Guy is great. Fact.Now that I did a few comments(obligatory, perhaps) about the cast, let's talk about the film. Yeah, the film uses a lot editing, and I'm generally hate when a film uses by resource to talk the story In flashbacks after a supposedly great conflict, and then when the development is over it go back and continues the story where it's paused I mean, I really hate that, because is so unnecessary,and it kind reports a problem in the film.But, I mean, a very big but(:-D), the editing somehow, works, and a lot, for this film. It genuinely thought that the flashback story was the only way to keep things interesting. So, the edition was really, really great, and the result was very good. This coming from someone that really don't likes overly edited story lines. But in talented hands, overly edited films can be masterpieces(look at Pulp Fiction and Memento, for example), so in filmmaking all it's possible. And in the talented hands of David O. Russel, American Hustle became the second film ever that appeals to this annoying flashback resource and against all odds become a great film. But I just talked about the editing. Now I'll talk about the story. The characters are a great part of it. They are all charismatic and funny in their own way. I liked it a lot, really. It's humorous, but it's surprisingly(my surprise) hilarious most of the time. I was expecting something like a dramatic comedy, but in a percentage I would say that 90% of it is comedy while the rest is drama. So, definitely not a drama like some are saying(what they are thinking anyways?)The one liners were terrific, because they were idiotic and utterly nonsense. Russel had a great control of the story though, he knew how to balance the things, and due that, the dramatic scenes had a great impact. It's also with a few twists, like 'who is in which side' and stuff like that. This film may con you, literally. It's after all a extremely catchy story, worth of various re-watches. And is definitely one of my favorite films right now. 9.9/10",8,0,5,13 January 2014
Top Secret!," Dumb, ridiculous, unfunny
","I am probably suspicious to say anything about this film, since that i really dislike the parody genre, but frankly that one is awful even for that genre. Jesus. It's so dull and repetitive that almost walked out. I mean, obviously there was a gag or two that inevitably made me laugh, specifically the cows scene, but apart of that scene, the rest is garbage. The story is totally disjointed and confuse, even for a spoof film. Some of the references are not funny at all, and i am familiar with the WW2 'spy' sub-genre. Val Kilmer's debut couldn't be any worse. He tries to be funny, but his acting limitations were evident here. Being funny is not something easy, anyways. Omar Sharif was, despite his relatively short screen-time, in the most dumbest and ridiculous gags in the film. I didn't want to believe that the guy who played the protagonist so masterfully in Dr. Zhivago was in that dumb film. After 90 minutes of childish and crude sexual jokes, you probably will think: What did i just watch? Because it's really impressive: but not in a good way.Avoid it. 3.8/10",4,4,18,20 December 2013
Incendies," Involving Psychological Thriller
","This film is widely considered one of the best films that came out in 2010, and rightfully deserves this acclaim. The story starts pretty simple: two brothers needs to enter in a quest on the birth-land of their deceased mother in order to follow her last wish: to find and give two letters for their 'lost' son. It sounds very simple and generic, but while the story is advancing the film really starts to involve you into Nawal's story, that is told in flashbacks. So i don't need to say that the development of the characters is very good.As i was saying, her life is told by flashbacks. The editing don't makes very clear in the beginning of the film what was happening at all, but soon we start to get a notion of which story is Nawal's story and then, as i also already said, gt involved by the story. And while we follow Nawal's story, we are also following a world of pure horror and cruelty, which may upset some viewers, but again, some of these cruelties depicted are essential to our understand of the story, and also to establish a compromise with the viewer.This film is not for everyone though, it has some blatantly critics to the Christianity's followers, so be aware of that fact before watching the film if you are one of these persons that become easily offended by that kind of stuff. Just a warning.The cinematography in this film is very beautiful at times, it is totally done using only digital cameras. I also liked the homage to the French New Wave's films, whose directors used lots of cuts of a same scene but in different angles in the only purpose of mock the 'Hollywood Blockbusters' kind of cinematography.And i also find the music score to be very interesting.Anyways, it's a must watch film. And the so-called ending wasn't so powerful to me, but that's just me. I have already watched a couple films with similar powerful ending, so this one wasn't that much of a 'shock' for me.. 8.4/10Although, is far from being perfect. It has a few events that are just forced upon the viewer, and that is not cool.",8,0,2,8 December 2013
Léon: The Professional," One of the best crime films of the 80s or 90s...
","My rating: 9,0/10 Is actually a bit cheesy at times. But overall the film is very effective, and effective in all aspects. Starting with the cinematography: an oppressive look in the interior scenes _ houses with tight halls and grimy walls_ and a cold, desolated one in the exterior scenes _with a mostly gray palette of colors, streets with big corners and dead ends. This odd, dark ambient, added to a lovely romantic soundtrack, gives this film a distinct, perfect atmosphere. *About the story:* 'There is poetry in the dialogs, and there is definitely some artistry put in this film. Is very similar to TDK in that aspect. Very good character development, something extremely rare in this sort of film. A few things felt forced here and there, but overall, a good and moving story about a kid growing up all by herself in a totally hostile environment.' *And to finish, the acting:* 'Great performances by Oldman, Reno and Portman. They are definitely the highlights of the film. Oldman is a scene stealer here, with his ultra over the top acting.' *Conclusion...One of the best crime films of the 80s or 90s.",9,4,5,23 July 2014
Grease," Regardless of it's classic status, it's worth a watch
","I don't know what so say about a film that was already discussed a lot as this one, so i'll try to be a bit different of the other reviewers and will talk about two things in Grease's story which i found very interesting. Despite being lighthearted almost all the time, it has a couple of melancholic moments that are way too 'dark' to the film's nature. It's very clear to me, in my opinion. For example, Sandy turns into a 'bad girl' in order to be popular and to fit in the society in the end. So the then snob Danny now is the one running after her. That is very sad.Also, Frenchy, Sandy's friend, drop out school to make beauty classes. However, after a while she needs to go back to school because she had failed with the beauty class. Smashed her dreams with no way back. That's depressive, man.I'm just mentioning two melancholic highlights that no one seems to care about, mostly due to it's lighthearted treatment in the film.Overall, it's a funny film to watch. The first and the last songs of the musical are by far the best of this musical in my opinion, but all of them are very well choreographed. Travolta really does a very good job, and so does his film's partner Olivia Newton John, which earn the role in Grease due to Travolta's recommendation.Recommended, a musical classic. 7.5/10",7,0,1,14 November 2013
The Village," Almost as bad as i was expecting
","I had a curious story with this film before watching it for the first time. I avoided it like the plague in the last month, mostly due to a bad feeling about it. Seriously, i missed lots of opportunities to see this film. I generally don't listen to critics opinions and stuff, but i don't know. In this case, it's like if something were holding me back to not watch this film. But today i finally gave up , left my fears and watched The Village.Well, it wasn't as bad as i thought it was, but still, is indeed not a good film in any means in this planet. The plot is awful if you really think about it. The dialog is very vague, pointless and cheesy. 90% of them don't adds nothing to the story, which s a very bad fact. Some events requires way too many suspension of disbelief to really appreciate it. As far as i watched,a blind girl which can do absolutely everything as a normal person does and a retard smarter than people with implied much more intelligence than him are quick examples of how much you needs to suspend your disbelief. The character development is just normal, and there is no setting in any ways to be able to do this 'suspension'.The acting is not exactly in the level of what you are used to see coming from this relatively ensemble cast, but i don't put the fault entirely in the actors. They don't have that much to work with, besides the poor dialogs and the dull pointless events. The cinematography, the art design and the soundtrack are top- notch though, but a film is not only about these technical aspects.Not recommended. 5.4/10",5,3,5,27 November 2013
Doctor Zhivago," Interesting until the climax of the film, then it gets boring
","Doctor Zhivago is such an interesting and intriguing film. It's a very unconventional work for the standards of the 60s. Why? It's all about the narrative. The way that the story is told is unconventional and original, 'cause in the vastly majority of times the protagonist is presented and 'explained' into the very first thirty minutes. However, there in Dr.Zhivago, the protagonist barely appears in the first 30 minutes, and is a weak character until the entire first hour. This happened due to an unusual break of the rule which i mentioned previously. Instead of presenting the protagonist, it chooses to develop a secondary character.But it was an unfortunate choice, because the story of this secondary character is not important to the point to deserve an entire 60 minutes just focused in it. It's not boring.neither is uninteresting; is just pointless. I also bothered with the plenty of pointless characters in this film. Sure they are interesting, but almost none of them adds absolutely nothing to the film. The final 30 minutes are very disappointed too.Now, in the technical regards, this film is nothing less than formidable. Good cinematography and soundtrack. The acting, nothing less than phenomenal. Highlights for the performance by Omar Sharif as Yuri. And to the entire cast as well; all the actors do deserves shoot outs. The overacting aspect broke the dark,tough and somewhat realistic atmosphere of the film.So, if you are planing to watch it, do it. This film is a classic, and also a somewhat interesting experience. 7.3/10.",7,0,2,7 November 2013
We're the Millers," If fart jokes made good films...
","This film is everything that any pubescent may want, at least to spend his time in the theater with his friends: a crude film full of sexual and fart jokes, filled also with supposedly funny references to the pop culture, that may have good intentions, but in the end they are just stupid and pointless.I really don't get it what was so funny about 80% of the jokes on this film. I mean, seriously? I never thought that 'vagina' and 'penis' were so extremely funny words, perhaps i should try reviewing my concepts of funniness, because it is either me that am too square or is the film that were too stupid to conceive funny 'jokes' instead of making fun of pointless subjects like sexual relations and things of that genre. It's seems implausible for me to believe that the writer and the director of this film had read the plot and thought that it was funny or whatever.But before the hate starts, i want to say that it is not a totally unfunny film, I personally laughed once or twice at the stupidities presented in the screen. But that's all.The acting is horrible, i don't know if it played a big part or not in my evaluation about this film(because the plot almost single handed convinced me that it was a bad film), but it was bad. Jennifer Aniston don't seems to be caring at all about this film, and neither does Ed Helms, who usually draws attention and is kinda funny even when he is annoying(like in almost all his films). Here he is just a bore. I generally expect good acting from comedies, because as the old proverb says, 'the joke is on tell it.'. So yes, I'm always looking forward in that aspect.Not recommended. 5.1/10",5,0,1,7 December 2013
Apocalypse Now," Filmmaking as it's finest.
","This film is one of the few ones that i've watched which really left me completely speechless. WoW. That's an incomparable film experience. Just...wow. I want to start talking about the french cinema in it. Mr. Coppola put in 'Apocalypse now!' a lot of french cinema 'references', most specifically in the famous 'French New Wave' style. It's possible to see the influence of the french film movement in Apocalypse Now!. For example, the narrative , which follows a very non-linear 'conflict' construction. You can see in various moments, specially in the Redux version, that the story is not going ahead. In fact, the only and crucial difference between a 'French New Wave' film and 'Apocalypse Now!' Is that the latter has a definite premise, unlike the vastly majority of Novelle VaguÃ¨ films.Now, talking about the film: The story itself is just fantastic. The perturbation of the men when he faces the horror is arguably the most explored subject in the film,and Sheen did a very good job portraying this kind of men. But for me, the most interesting thing in the film is that we have the protagonist, a war veteran, just watching the totally unexperienced guys becoming crazy due to the bizarre atmosphere and situations of the war. Another spectacular aspect in this film(which can't be forgotten in any means) is the cinematography. It plays a very huge part in the film. I could describe it how great and insane it looks,but no words could really explain nothing about it. It need to be seen to be believed,trust me. Apocalypse Now! is one of the most genial works in the cinema history. 10/10",10,0,1,3 November 2013
The White Ribbon," Haneke's masterpiece
","Wow, that is a great film. It's only the second Haneke's I watched(got introduced by Amour) and now I faced a real masterpiece. The bleakness and the very dark humor, the incredibly deep depth the characters had, despite each one of them barely having much more than 15-20 minutes of screen time..the acting was great...the cinematography was excellent...all around great.I really loved the ending(I know it bothered some people), because if you really think about it, was the ideal ending. We saw lots of details, suggestions through the film, lots of details and things that weren't totally explained, so making a 'close- ending' would actually kill all of the magic and the interesting parts about the film. Is really an entertaining film, but is even a better one to to sit around a table and discuss.After all, a good film is the one which leaves you thinking about it through days, weeks or even months after watching it.",10,1,4,8 May 2014
Dallas Buyers Club," Great characters, great performances
","Dallas Buyers Club was a great surprise for me. Matthew McCounaghey puts here his bes career performance by far, and in my opinion the best performance that I've seen in the entire year. He lost 44 pounds and incorporated the Texan with the HIV disease perfectly. He really disappears in the role. But above that all, the story has a lot of layers, but it always goes ahead, never get boring or something, because somehow these layers(the conflicts in his personal life, and how his life changed after he discovered he had HIV, and how the Dallas Buyers Club is build). The development of the protagonist is excellent, every detail in the story is important, has a goal into the film. As a result, the story always goes ahead, it never stops in pointless scenes. I also find quite easy to get through the film. The story is full of conflicts, and as I said, it never stops in being interesting. It's after all, about real life happenings. I find interesting when the Bio- film is made entirely based in a period of the life of one person, and not about trying to resume a person's life in 120 minutes. Being said, everything depends on how well the story is told. And Dallas Buyers Club is, guaranteed, a great story. The most entertaining film of the year. 8.8/10",9,1,1,17 January 2014
Now You See Me," The critics are coming for all the wrong reasons
","Seriously, i'm just shocked to see how many critics this film received. It's a perfectly enjoyable and well made film. C'mon. The plot is maybe too absurd and flawed for some, and i can understand that. In a superficial sight, you can really see that in some parts, i admit that, the events are not very well explained, and the ending was probably not a good deal, and in that i agree, obscure and quite nonsense. But to put the fault in the character's development is a little too idiotic. The magicians are not the protagonists anyways, so what the film shows is exactly what we need to know about them: they were cheap artists, which were selfish about their gifts and they just used them for money. But later they found a reason bigger than them to use these gifts and make their tricks, without being selfish enough to ask for money in exchange. That's it. They can be seen as an allegory of the man itself, which don't think that to live for himself is good enough and follows something that they don't even know if exists or not, just for the faith of that there is a good and bigger proposal. And after reaching all the objectives, they finally can met their creator, God, that can been seen as Mark Ruffalo's character in the film. Another hint of why i assume that is because his character has eyes everywhere, he knows exactly what everyone is doing into his plan. But of course, is just my theory. You may accept it or not. I don't have any complains about the acting. Average. Neither good or bad. Convincing, but without impact. The cinematography is very good, Oscar nomination worthy for sure. Some scenes are really breath-taking, such as the first presentation of the magicians in a show. Anyways, it's a film worth of a watch. Not sure about a re watch, though. 6.8/10",7,0,4,22 November 2013
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Rather dull and full of cheesy dialogs. Still, a watchable film.
","The film is okay. There are some ridiculous expository dialog at the beginning, some dull scenes such as when Charles(James MacVoy) punches Magneto in the face when he first see him in the elevator. I mean, what? It didn't make any sense.Also, Raven changing her body in public, where everyone could spot her. Really? So freaking dull. Also, it's impossible to deny the inconsistency of logic in the saga so far. And the plot is basically a rip-off of every successful Sci Fi film ever made. For example, the plot is almost a carbon copy of The Matrix. Just replace time-travel with a computer generated reality, and wham. And the ending is ripped off from Inception. Even the music score is similar.But obviously, there are good thing music s about it.mFor example, QuickSilver character is probably the most awesome of the film, and despite having few screen time, he is in one of the best scenes in the film. Also, Peter Dinklage was surprisingly good. There are some memorable scenes in the film to keep the average viewer entertained.So yeah, is probably my biggest let down of the year. Expectes much more from this film. Worth watching, but don't expect a 'The Dark Knight' quality.7/10",7,7,14,24 May 2014
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Original with cool visuals, but a below-average film overall
","Scott Pilgrim is a highly original film, no one can deny that, but it's just that. It don't has a good story or whats ever. It looks like a homage to the nerd and emo world, with constant references to video games and symbolism used in the modern pop rock culture. Of course, it's not boring, and the visuals are very interesting. You can see some inspirations of the film 'Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless mind' in it, such as the ice ground location and the fact that Mary Elizabeth Winstead's character is impulsive and always change his hair, much alike Kate Winslet's character in the aforementioned film. But unfortunately, the story is way too dull for my taste. Almost dull just for the sake of being dull.Is just...dull. Some funny moments, or at least supposed to be funny, don't works in it. The acting was also terrible and dull. I couldn't stand the underacting of most actors. Too bad. In a quick and short resume, Scott Pilgrim is original, it's a disappointing style over content kind of film. 6.3/10",6,0,2,21 November 2013
Gone with the Wind," Surprisingly good and entertaining during it's 220 minutes
","Gone with the Wind is a good film. Outdated, but it's good. Being said, everything on it seems necessary for the whole experience. Not the best or most entertaining three hours long-plus film I've watched, since that it varies from extremely good to very bad and melodramatic moments. Very inconsistent, but again, mostly good. And it's impossible to not consider how well made and big this film is, and then consider the age it was done(1939!). It basically did open the doors for the other successful 'epic' films that would come, due to it thunderous success(a film that big in 1939 would obviously make success).What most surprised me was the dark tone of the film, I am certainly it bothered some prudes in the age. Treason and tragedies makes it looks like the film in the poster, which clearly suggests that it's a dull romance film. It does a good work picturing the horrors of war and how it changes people, mostly for bad. There is about a hour and a half passing through the war.The cinematography is nothing less than excellent, but outdated, since that some angles aren't even used anymore. The special effects and the non-stop soundtrack bothered me as well,but not as much as the stage- like exaggerated acting, which was common in the 30s I suppose, but for now it's pretty ridiculous and outdated.Well, I haven't much more to say about this film. If you are facing nothing to do so this film will fits well for you. Though if you are bored and wants something dynamic don't even try this film. It's length is the worst part about this film, even more for an audience that can't stand films that are slowly paced than The Avengers(2012) nowadays. But I'm sure that most film lovers really like this film, so if you want something mainstream but totally out of the parameters, check it out. 8.3/10",8,0,1,10 January 2014
District 9," Fantastic
","District 9 is one of those films that need to be seen to be believed,literally. Few times we've seen so much overall content in a sci-fi film since The Matrix. Starting with the plot: a relatively original and very creative script, which uses some allegorical representations of the real world to compose the aliens and the protagonist personality. Absolutely great. So is the plot. Obviously,it has his flaws, some greater and some not so perceptible, but it has. Still, a great job done by Neill Blomkanp. The cinematography and the CGI are absolutely great as well, and so is the make-up. Shame i can't tell more than that without spoiling the film. Sharlto Copley did a good job too. A underrated performance,perhaps. Still, if you want to watch this film, don't think twice to do it.",9,2,3,27 October 2013
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Great story, great visuals, great music... A masterpiece.
","This is just one of the most beautiful and greatest films ever made. No room for discussion here. If you really like films you'll love The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug. And it's not a matter of taste. When a film is that good, it does no matter if you are fan of horror, comedy, action or drama, even because The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug have it all. So you'll automatically like it. An insanely entertaining film for anyone.And unlike the 'tongue in the cheek' first installment of the Hobbit's trilogy, Desolation of Smaug is a much better and serious film. It don't have anymore the unfunny and idiots pointless jokes. It's a serious film, just like it should be. And that time it has a much more thrilling atmosphere and also insane action scenes!The cinematography is excellent as usual, and the action scenes are just unbelievably mesmerizing and entertaining. Insane! And the music in the ending credits was aces! A perfect soft and delicate score to contrast with the great and abrupt climax. The plot obviously is top-notch! The main story works extremely well as an allegory to the World War II(Dwarfs are the Jews and Orcs are the Nazis; think about that). Tolkien was a master, no wonder his book 'Hobbit' is the best fantasy work ever written.I only had a minor complaint. It's about the CGI used in the orcs, that is a bit outdated. The rest, top notch. Guaranteed, the ending will left you with a feeling of 'wanna more'!The definition of an Epic Film. Go watch it. Can't wait for the last epic chapter of that magnificent trilogy. 9.6/10",8,2,11,14 December 2013
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," One of the best recent westerns.
","The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford' is arguably one of the best westerns that came out recently, and undoubtedly its a good watch. As you can see, it has an unconventional title, spoiling the greatest event in the film, and also the way the film is told, with a narrator always telling the story, and always ahead of the happenings in the scenes. It's pretty original, if you analyze the film as a 'whole'.Robert Ford wasn't more coward than James, but his infamous reputation created after killing a man, a man which was notoriously known for being a 'brave' man, started the folks that lead him to a fast fame and a even fastest decadency. He wasn't nowhere near as important as James were, so his name fell into oblivion after his death.But is sad, because he was very young and just wanted to be as recognized and famous as James, his childhood idol. Actually, this is also the why he made a plan with the government.But perhaps, when you commit a big mistake, even if you are moved by the fuel of the youngness, it will earns serious consequences for the rest of your life. In Ford's case, he was rejected by society and received an inevitable revenge. Treason.As you see, this film is beautifully shot, but what really drew me attention was the music: It's great, and his melancholic's undertones totally fits the dense atmosphere of this film. The film is also pretty stylized, and well made, due the good work of the edition. The acting was also indeed good, notably by Sam Rockwell and Casey Affleck, which interpreted respectively the undecided Charlie Ford and the 'young' in all the senses of the word Robert Ford.It's a good film, shame it bombed on the box office. 8.1/10",9,1,2,28 November 2013
Before Sunset," A great film about details, with very dynamic dialogs
","There is no much to be said in a small review about this film. What i can say is that is a fantastic film and should be seen for everyone. It's all dialog based, but they are so interesting that it keeps you involved in the story in the entire and relatively short running time of around 80 minutes. It follows accurately the events of 'Before Sunrise' , the first installment of the now 'Before's trilogy' that it's set 9 years after the events of the aforementioned film. The protagonists share their experiences of the past 9 years, thoughts about the world and themselves. It's fantastic, and as i said, each subject talked about is richly detailed and interesting. There is apparently no cuts, every event is told in it's fully form. In fact, it is a real-time film, if that exists. And again, it's noteworthy saying: It's all about details. The walking on Paris's streets, the harmful barroom, the nature in the park, the emotions raising after each dialog about their lives... wonderfully rich.Definitely worth checking out. 9.2/10",9,0,0,3 January 2014

","Simply amazing and breath-taking. This is really a great epic and lives up to its expectations. Is not perfect and there are few things who will bother the modern viewer (dated sets and lightning use are very noticeable at times) and also, the sound editing and the mixing in general is very meh and cheesy. Limitations of the time, I understand.But overall, the acting, cinematography, editing and the story are all around great. All great. Some reviewers at the time criticized the lack of depth, but its barely noticeable frankly. The story is more about honor and spiritual conflicts rather than a conspiracy thriller, or whatever these critics meant by depth.The way it glorified the war, however, is what will hold some viewers back, me included. Some would say its the equivalent of the birth of a nation for anti-war defenders.",9,0,2,22 April 2014
Drive," Classy style over substance
","I really wanted to like 'Drive'. Really. It has almost all the aspects i appreciate in a film. Good art direction, contemporary, and mostly in the night, with a great soundtrack based on electro-music with a retro touch on it. There is some kind of nostalgic feeling, in fact, in the soundtrack of drive. Looks like something made in the 80s despite being very actual and pursuing actual electro beats. I would say its sorta annoying in the first watch, but then, trust me, with a re-watch, it gets a lot better.But the plot is very straight to face. There is no subtly or depth to the characters. It don't makes people think. Is like a generic hero fairy tail, which in fact, i despise. And once is over, you don't need to return there, not for the story at least.Also, the characters are way one-dimensional, there is the good, the bad, the girl, all painted in black and white. Apart from the driver, which is obviously supposed to be a very ambiguous character, the rest are the classic 'sympathize or despise' kind of characters. I wouldn't say its predictable or something. And though i liked the fact it somewhat contrasts the peaceful scenes with the voracious and violent scenes, i thought the violence was very very harsh and excessive. Unless if that was the director main intention, so he could 'show the violence like it really is, ugly and shocking', so i say bravo, but i'm afraid he just likes to use the gore for 'fetishist' purposes. Pity, unfortunately.In the end, it is worth check it out, but there is nothing so special about it. 7.8/10",8,0,2,2 January 2014
Good Will Hunting," Smart and touching
","Good Will Hunting may be cliché and predictable, but still an excellent film. Affleck and Damon, with the help of both Rob Reiner and William Goldman, created a history that is at the same time smart and very beautiful and touching. The conflicts of the main character may be very relatable to anyone. For example, how many times you've realized that you could do easily certain things, but you refused to do so 'only' because they aren't what you want for your life? Obviously, Will had his other conflicts, such as the trauma which leads him to do the bad things, and which as well disturb him in his relationships. This is what i found beautiful in this film. Even a genius has enormous troubles, because he is a human being like everyone. I found Will Hunting character very likable as well. I mean, how many persons never got in trouble choosing the job, trouble to plan his future, and etc. I bet that very few persons never experienced or met someone that never experienced that.The acting is very good. Damon is in shape, maybe bringing his best career's performance to this film. Robin Williams did a very good job as well, so well that the role earned an Oscar for him in 1998. The film's editing and cinematography are extremely well made. A curiosity would be the fact that despite the story's events being set in South Boston, great part of the main cinematography is set in Toronto.Anyways, Good Will Hunting is a good watch. 8.4/10",8,1,4,15 November 2013
Schindler's List," Great film, Spielberg's best
","So here we go in my 80th review, in this November 28th 2013, coincidentally the day of an American Holiday Thanksgiving Day. Nothing better in fact than watch a very good film in that special date for those who celebrate it, and for sure, Schindler's List is the perfect film. It's very cliché to say that, because as we all know it is a very popular and acclaimed film from both critics and audiences, and is widely regarded as one of The Greatest of All Times, but even with these accolades, i think i need to say it's a great film, because it has everything you can seek in a film. It's sad, it shows how the war can affect otherwise normal people as Göth_masterfully interpreted by Ralph Fiennes_ in wicked and psycho assassins, which believed so much in the Nazism that he turned into a disturbed man.But unlike Schindler himself says in the film's beginning, a war also can turn a 'bad' person in a 'good' one, perhaps. Schindler was a completely egocentric person, but after the vision of the girl in red which contrasts with the black and white scenario. She clearly has a specific allegoric sense, and so had the candles. Then he starts to help the Jews, and he really did everything that he could do to help them, until the war's end. And despite my despise for these conventional 'black and white' characters, this film works very well exploring these, i must say, one-dimensional characters. With an exception to Göth,of course, because he had various faces in the film, though all due to his madness.I don't need to say that the cinematography and art design were fantastic in this film. It Principal photography took place in Kraków, Poland, over the course of 72 days in 1993. Spielberg shot the film in black and white and approached it like a documentary. Cinematographer Janusz Kamiński wanted to give the film a sense of timelessness. I highly recommend this film, if you haven't already watched it. 9.4/10",9,16,25,28 November 2013
Unknown," An 'average' action-popcorn flick.
","'Unknown' has almost everything which you can expect from a legit 'popcorn' film: a dull script, cool cinematography and lots of freaking illogic action scenes. Not the best of the genre, obviously because even popcorn flicks have a very high level of competition nowadays.But if you want to be aware about this film, here i give a few examples of the badness in it: dumb dialogues, ridiculous and somewhat unintentionally comic situations, embarrassingly cliché(yes, the last half-hour is just pathetic) a super-predictable twist, and Liam Neesonmay not deliver exactly the kind of quality in his acting which youare familiar with. But who cares? This film was born to be bad. Nothing 'good' added to it would make a difference either. So, if you want to watch it,watch it for your own risk.5.5/10",5,2,3,2 November 2013
Moulin Rouge!," Perfect as a film can get
","Baz Luhrmann masterpiece's 'Moulin Rouge' falls into the very definition of a masterpiece. Not only because it's like one of the greatest films ever made, but mainly because of its inimitable uniqueness for anyone, but the originator of the work, that obviously know the formula of his films. Few times i've seen in fact a film so great and peculiar to the point that it simply can't be reproduced. The style, the use of modern music in a period film, the crazy and stunning editing, and the colorful art direction and the excellent acting by both leads and also by the supporting actors are remarkable in this film. Again, never seen nothing like that before. The story may sound cliché, as the old Shakeaperian romance tale, but it simply don't matters in the end. What matters is the way its told here, in an entertaining and highly artistic way. Nicole Kidman is in one of his career-best performances in Moulin Rouge. Ewan McGregor also does well, but what really does even better than act is sing! His very first musical part is the best of the entire film in my opinion.The cinematography is fantastic, and there are tons of references to films of the early 20th century, all made for a comedic but conscious purpose. The scene when the lovers warmly embrace, there is a curtain in the shape of heart right behind them background can be seen the curtain in the shape of heart, doing a suggestive outline around them.Highly recommended and absolutely one of the best films i've seen. 9.7/10",10,0,3,29 December 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," What the producers were thinking?
","What the producers were thinking? This film is offensive to braincells.An horrible film. Terrible. It has good visuals, inspired from Watchmen and Michael Bay films, to be exactly. But the film is overall laughable. Non stop unfunny jokes, an incoherent story, full of plot holes and under-developed characters, atrocious acting and ridiculous sub-plots. The villains came from nowhere, like if they decided all at once 'Lets kill Spider Man for the sake of it!'. and they never attacked in group(like anyone intelligent enough would do). If they had a useful brain, Electro and Green Goblin would've attacked Spider Man together.For those who thought SM 3 was bad, check this one out. You will pee in your pants laughing at how bad this film is.",4,11,24,1 May 2014
Back to the Future Part III," Okay film, pretty average
","Back to the future III, is, as the name suggests , the third and eventually the last installment of the famous Back to the Future Trilogy. It's entertaining, funny at times, but i don't cared at all about the story, to be honest. I mean, i really liked the first one film, basically because of it's originality, then it comes the other two sequels, in 1989 and 1990 respectively, telling essentially the same story that was already told in the first one, just modifying the places and the 'villains'. I don't know if the sequels were necessary or not, but in fact they don't bring nothing new or as awesome as the first Back to the Future does, so i am inclined to say that these sequels were pointless. This may sounds weird, but Back to the Future's trilogy kinda reminds me of the Rio's trilogy, whose sequels to Rio Bravo, the Eldorado and Rio Lobo, were almost remakes of the first one. The only difference between both trilogies would be the lack of connection between the films on the Rio's trilogy, while Back to the Future's trilogy follows the traditional linear narrative, connecting all the three films.But anyways, this film may be or not worth a watch, but it's more of the same old Back to the Future. I liked the references to Taxi Driver and Apocalypse Now on it, and obviously, the constant references to Clint Eastwood in the film. Again, it's a well made film, just like the previous installments, but is just repetitive and somewhat forgettable. 6.6/10",7,1,5,25 November 2013
Lincoln," Great film, One of the best of 2012
","Lincoln is such a fantastic film. I don't know if i like it so much because it appeals a lot for me, since that i'm very interested in historical films with super- productions, but anyways, i love it. It's always fortunate when you can at the same time appreciate, learn a bit and being entertained by a film, and Lincoln guaranteed provides all these elements to the viewer. The stories told by Lincoln, in a great but overrated performance, are really great and entertaining, and i can forgive the fact that they are pretentiously put in the film just to make Lincoln appears as a great and almost flawless 'hero'. But even better than Lincoln's stories are The Courtroom discussions. This is where the film reaches it's apex, in my honest opinion. It's just fascinating to see Tommy Lee's character prosing and doing his oratory pro- Abolition of slavery. His words are funny and eloquent, just showing how bad-ass he is. However, i think that Lincoln had an unnecessary final 20 minutes, telling his death and stuff. I mean, there is no point to show his death at all. The film should've ended ten minutes after of the great climax. Unnecessary as well was Joseph- Gordon Levitt character's Robbie, whose importance to this film is irrelevant to the main subject. The music was also disappointingly cheesy and generic. Overall, Lincoln don't appeals to a great audience as the super- hero blockbusters, but can be as entertaining as one of them, if you watch it with the right eyes. 8.2/10",8,1,1,24 November 2013
Kelly's Heroes," Worthy a watch, but isn't so good.
","Kelly's Heroes is not a funny film at all. In fact, it's kinda hard to make a war film with comedy tones. Sure Donald Sunderland cartoon esque character was weird, but not funny into the context of the film. The premise is very outdated and apparently from a Spaghetti Sergio Leone western _The Good,the bad and the Ugly_ it was to enter in a quest for gold beyond the enemy lines. The gold was hidden in a bank, of course, instead of buried in the sand.Although it has some great moments when it isn't trying to be funny(fail). Some fight and shootouts scenes were really great. Apocalypse Now obviously got some inspirations from this film, as the scene where the mad characters play music while destroying a village. The art design was very inconsistent. Sometimes great, sometimes poor. So were the cinematography. The filming commenced in July 1969 and was completed in December and was shot on location in the Istrian village of Viinada in the former Yugoslavia and London. Yugoslavia was chosen mostly because earnings from previous showings of movies there could not be taken out of the country, but could be used to fund the production.The music in this film is one of the best aspects of this film so far. The film score was composed, arranged and conducted by Lalo Schifrin and the soundtrack album was released on the MGM label in 1970.This is an average film overall, but very worth watching. 7.3/10",7,1,4,19 November 2013
Children of Men," A wonderful/gritty film about hope and faith
","Children of Men is one of the greatest film achievements of this century, a dazzling and breath taking work by the now Oscar Winner Alfonso Cuarón, he should certainly have been nominated and won in 2006 as well, because this film is fantastic. It's dark and gritty, but there is when the hope and faith of a better world rises. Children of Men is not only a great technical achievement, but also a class of story telling. It don't has captivating characters or memorable performances, but it almost doesn't matter. The story itself is so fascinating and layered, full of possible meanings, that the characters seems like small players in a much larger and bigger picture that is this film's background. Highly recommended. 9.5/10Worth noting: Children of Men has an all time effort on the editing. The takes seem much longer than they really are thankfully to the perfect image transition done by Cuarón's team. The last 30 minutes are heavy and breath taking, and much of the film impact is in large part due to the editing work.",9,1,3,9 March 2014
Million Dollar Baby," Cringeworthy at times and brilliant at others
","Million Dollar Baby is a very inconstant film in quality terms. The start, I mean, the first twenty minutes of film are full of over the top situations (such as the conversation with the priest scene), silly inane dialogs, and a weird voice over by Morgan Freeman narrating everything that happened in the film, even when wasn't needed at all. Yes, horrible way to start a film. I felt that the actors were very uncomfortable saying certain lines because it was truly awful. Paul Haggis, no wonder. The guy who wrote and directed the arguably most moronic and inane(and undeserved) Oscar Winner Picture ever(Crash). Clint's direction was really really good, because the film was brilliant since the 30 minutes and this 'briliantism' lasted until the final 30 minutes. Was really good. The main problem with this film is the quantity of unrealistic situations. A hospital would never allow a patient's leg gangrene, for example. The priest was also completely put of the reality in the film. These among numerous other problems. I could enjoy a lot this film, which is technically very good too, I think Clint and Swank gave their best performances in their careers, but there is way too many awful parts that can't be forgiven. 7/ 10",7,2,4,1 March 2014
Prisoners," One of the most exciting thrillers of the last years
","Prisoners is a very good film. Firstly, the history-telling is great. The characters development served absolutely fine in the film. In fact, It's much more a story-film than a character-film(if that makes sense...). I mean, it's 150 minutes runt-time just flew by, because the story was incredibly instigating, and there was always something 'important' happening. The atmosphere of the film is dark, gritty; exactly what the film needed. And yes, shockingly violent.Second, the acting. Everyone was good but Jake Gyllenhall was definitely the one who stole the scene. He made a real freaky detective, and his gestures and mannerisms made for the 'Loki' character were priceless. Also liked, in a lesser extent, Hugh Jackman. His character is the most layered though.I also really liked one of the key components of this film that was the cinematography. Cold, dark with a 'modern' touch, all the artistic method used by the great Roger Deakins. The editing was also well-done, as we see in the final moments in the film.I wished I could've felt more the sounds of the ambient though. Everything was beautifully well made, well crafted, lacking a good job in the music/sound department. The score was way generic.Anyway...Prisoners is a very well crafted and an exciting thriller, undeniable one of the best released recently. 8.5/10",8,1,2,13 February 2014
Elysium," Big deception, nowhere near the level of District 9
","I genuinely felt insulted after watching this cliché guided film with a running time of apparently interminable 109 minutes. Everything on Elysium was done in past films, and done much better. It looks like Blomkamp decided to mix up the hacker concept from The Matrix, the Wachowski classic Sci-Fi film, with some of the visuals and the 'fast cure' conception from the unconventional Sci-Fi film by François Truffaut 'Fahrenheit 451', and it has even a lot of digested subjects used in District 9 that are used again here in Elysium. The film was lazy made in the creation aspects, as you can see.The character development is incredibly obscure; the film don't reveals nothing important or attractive about the life of the character, so the viewer barely knows who this zero personality and extremely apathetic protagonist is, you just know of course that he is going to lead something great and probably will need to sacrifice himself in order to save the earth. OK, i couldn't care less. Matt Damon does not help either, he brings the enthusiasm of a sloth to his role. Copley was a cartoon like villain, but cartoon is perhaps a definition that all the characters he play may receive. He is good playing the over the top guy, though.Some parts does not even make sense. Sharlto character's letting the protagonist escape without any reasons is one of them. And Elysium should be a much better prepared place than it really was. I mean, five dudes almost blew up the entire thing. And the worst part is that this film is totally predictable and cliché. You know exactly how it is going to end, because it has so many overused ideas that it seems impossible to NOT predict what is going to happen next. What happened with the creativity?!Well, the cast overall was average or above average at best. Definitely nothing remarkable in that aspect. The cinematography is meh, nothing that can't be seen better made in like twenty films in this year alone.I do not recommend this film. Go watch District 9 instead. 5.3/ 10.",5,3,6,5 December 2013
Life Is Beautiful," To See the Good Side of Life
","'La Vite è Belle' touches very deeply into the concept of meaning of life. It's a study about seeing the beautiful side of the things, doesn't matter the nature of that thing. It looks like a hard theme to put in film, because it's not that easy to convince the viewer to buy such theme. So director Roberto Benigni picked a very controversial and somewhat extreme subject to put this idea in: The Holocaust. Hardly someone would think in a good side of the Holocaust, and certainly it hasn't any. But we can only cheer and appreciate what Benigni tried to do. He dared a lot doing that.And Benigni seems to be really the star in all aspects of this film. His acting was very impressive, it reminded me a bit of the Jerry Lewis performances, but it obviously has much more serious tons than the latter. Being said, the entire cast did a very satisfying performance.The film score(and the soundtrack in general) is perhaps one of the most beautiful that i've heard in a film. Really impressive. And so are the beautiful takes of the city. The scene where it's raining at night and Vito is escorting his 'princess' to her home is a highlight.So, if you are planing to watch this film, do it. 8.4/10",8,2,3,5 November 2013
Eyes Wide Shut," Yeah right, one of Kubrick's best
","A study about relationships that turns to be also a competent thriller, and is as well a single and unique film, which already drew countless controversies,ambiguous interpretations and diverges opinions. Yeah, this is Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut. I always find lame when someone tell 'oh, that film is underrated' or 'oh, that one is overrated', but in that case, i need to go and defend this film. Because it's not only the most underrated piece of film in the history of cinema, but it is as well a masterpiece on it's own. I mean, dawn, the acting is good, the story is awesome and deep, the cinematography is attractive, and even the occasional music on it is awesome. In fact, this film has so many subtle meanings that you may get lost just tying to get them all. It's a film that i'm definitely going to watch it more and more times to really understand it in his entirely conception. A quick example of subtle meanings on Eyes Wide Shut would be the paintings. Look at them. They are not there without a reason. And each one has a particular meaning. And pay attention to the infamous orgy scene, which some may found it to be too distracting, to look at the paintings as well. References to the Roman empire are clever, if you look right on it. Be aware of everything on scene. Every shot of it is likely to be a work of art. A perfect 10/ 10.",10,5,9,24 November 2013
Jack Reacher," The dullness in this film gave me headache.
","This film is just plain dull, boring, uninteresting and cliché. I was expecting something at least with action scenes in the level of Transporter, that was a typical action flick. But Jack Reacher didn't offer nothing. It's bad.The style is very peculiar, though: it sounded like a film-noir in some parts, with Reacher playing the detective and seeking answers about the murders depicted in the film very beginning. OK, fine. But quickly, one of the various problems in this film became noticeable: the dialogs. It was so dull and cliché(i mean, the kind of dialogs that are overused in films such as the aforementioned transporter and the expendables) i started wondering why i didn't walked out. The one liners were also ridiculous and totally dull and unrealistic. Examples are quotes like 'You don't want to do that' and 'I'm sorry but i can't help you' are frequently used by our dearest protagonist Jack Reacher.The logic used by Jack works even when it's impossible to assume something at all. Example: there is a part where he quickly assumes that a bunch of amateurs 'assassins' were hired to 'terminate' him. The viewer has no clue at all about that until the middle of the film, yet he is sure about that since the beginning, what obviously does not make any sense.Ah, and there is obviously the 'chick' indispensable in any action film nowadays. You don't even need to watch the film to know what always happens: bandit kidnaps girl intending to kill the hero which will obviously will rescue the girl. Even if he claims that himself is not a 'hero', his behavior and actions tell the opposite, as we can see.K would talk about the acting, that is horrible just like everything else in that film, and also would talk about the boring car chases and the horrible action scenes, but i don't think that is worthy to spent anymore lines reviewing that film. Just avoid it. 4.2/10",4,2,4,16 December 2013
Les Misérables," Hands down one of the best musical films ever made, the very first masterpiece of this decade
","Stole in the Oscars and Snubbed by some critics. Ah! What they are thinking? This film is almost flawless, best of 2012 as far as i am concerned. The cinematography was OK, but the art direction really was top notch. The acting, in a cast overall, the best in a long while. The plot maybe hard for some to follow, since that it's all singed, as an opera. But it's terrific anyways. I was inclined to say that this film is entirely perfect after my first watching, but now i realize that it's not. But yes, the first one hour is perfect. Period. Denying that will be denying the truth. It's the best first hour ever in a film. You can search flaws on it, but you won't simply find. All the story development was fantastic, and the singing just added a poetry indeed to make it perfect.The second hour is very good, but not perfect. It had far many performances that just didn't worked for me. Still, they were all really well-made 'numbers'?. Anyways, what really drew my attention in that half was the revolutionizers and their fight to free the France, what brings a direct conflict with the government and the police force, which leads the revolutionizers to their *Spoiler* tragic end. This made me dislike totally the french people, since that they were cowards and choose to do nothing and being enslaved than to help a good cause. Bastards.Still in that second hour, i liked a lot the cinematography on the war sequences, it just brought an epic feeling to it, which of course, i found awesome! The score is also truly awesome, it looked like it fits much more the war sequences than the normal ones, though. And in fact, it was used much more in 'normal' situations.And now, a big paragraph to talk only about the cast:I just find unbelievable how Hugh Jackman didn't won the Oscars in that year. He absolutely was the best actor, and Daniel Day Lewis wasn't all that jazz in Lincoln. Jackman not only brings life,sorriness and the tiredness required for the role of Jean Valjean, but also does it superbly. Few times i've seen an actor so dedicated to a role. I also liked a lot Eddie Redmaine in this film, i've never seen him before anywhere, but he definitely convinced me in this role of Marius. And i became absolutely speechless about Anne Hathaway; she was just phenomenal in the film, one of the best performances by a woman in a musical since Björk in Dancer in the Dark, though Hathaway definitely did a better job. To be honest, it's one of the greatest performances ever. No jokes. I really doubt Hathaway would ever repeat half of the effort she put on Les Miserables. Of course, Amanda Seyfried was very annoying, one of the most cringing voices in the film, if not the most. But she acted well. All the cast did, including the Tarnadiérs infamous hustle couple, being Madame Thernadier interpreted by Helena Bonham Carter and the always hilarious Sacha Baron Cohen interpreting the dirty monsieur Thérnadier. Both were always hilarious when they appeared in the film, despite them being despicable and hated persons in the Victor Hugo's book. And their versions are much better made in the film, i say ya!If you haven't watched this film just yet... you are losing one of the best films made in the past 30 years! 9.8/10",9,1,4,4 December 2013
The Untouchables," Good Popcorn Flick
","I never was a fan and i'm afraid that i'll never be a fan of DePalma's works. Some of them have a campy aspect that is just not for me. So i thought that i would tend to dislike The Untouchables anyways before i even seen it. But while watching it i realized that is not 'so bad' as his other works. Sure is cheap and cliché, and the characters wear a typical black and white dresses, the villain is very bad and the good is very good. The end just follows the predictable story arc. But even yet, despite all my dislike towards cliché films(although based on real life events), i kinda liked this one. The cinematography is good, the art direction is very good, the score by Ennio Morricone fits perfectly in the film... And Robert DeNiro performance is not that bad as some claim it to be. Sure it was way too cartoon-esque, but he really don't appears a lot in this film. He is mentioned a lot in the film,though. I think that his performance was exactly what this film needed in order to not fade away Al Capone of it. So, if you are looking for a popcorn flick, Untouchables is the perfect choice. 7.5/10",7,1,1,18 November 2013
The Godfather: Part III," The weakest of the trilogy, but still good
","I came to watch this film with the lowest expectations. I knew beforehand that it wasn't as good as the previous(masterpieces) installments, and some said it wasn't even a good film at all. Well, I enjoyed it. Not as much as the first two, much less actually, but still a good film. I admit, I don't think it was necessary at all, but hey, neither the second installment was necessary after all. The Godfather could've been finished in the way the first film ended, because after all, it was an excellent ending. But the second still turned to be a masterpiece, so why not right? And anyways, no film is necessary by this logic. But lets go back to the main subject. The Godfather part III is a good film, that shows the old stage of Michael Corleone's life. Well, there is a fundamental difference in this film. Michael has much less screen time than in the previous The Godfather film, and almost as much screen time as the first Installment (that was no much more than one hour or so). His 'bastard' son, interpreted by Andy Garcia, is the one who shares screen time with Pacino. Unfortunately I don't find his character charismatic at all, what seems to be the intention. I just find him harmlessmy opinion, obviously. Those who watched The Godfather will find that his behavior looks a lot like Sonny, no wonder, is his son, so the behavior must be something hereditaryyeah, it wasn't impactive at all. And anyways, it shows much more about the tragic side of being in the mob than anything else. Michael in that film is not the same Michael as the previous installments, worthy noting. He is full penitence here, and is a totally different person. Not the cold gangster that we met. He don't wants to be a 'sinner' anymore. Well, I do understand why some fans of the first two film wont like it at all. It basically kills the irony that was all around the story.Technically, it's a great film, almost on par with the other films. Story wise, nowhere near. 7.8/10",8,3,5,10 January 2014
Psycho," Excellent
","Arguably Hitchcock's Magnum Opus, 'Psycho' is a classic. It not only made contributions to the horror genre, but is also considered one of the most important films in the cinema history. And rightfully so. It is really worth of all the hype.Just mentioning a few things: The script is magnificent: The character development is great into the film intentions, the plot is well established, the conflict as is well established, and the resolution is... well, if you to see for yourself! And as a typical good thriller,it's full of extremely well-conceived plot turns and twists which probably would catch anyone to watch this film, being familiar with the genre and style or not. The soundtrack is just classic... seriously, which person in this world never heard the track in the infamous 'shower scene'? Also, it plays a big part in the scarier moments in the film. The acting as well is nothing less than excellent. Anthony Perkins as the Bates guy is just perfect. But my shoot-outs are really going to sir. Alfred Hitchcock. I have to say that this movie only would work with HIM being the director. No one could do what he did. This is also what makes Psycho so good and special. If you haven't watched it yet, don't waste your time: Do it now! 10/10",10,0,1,30 October 2013
Zero Dark Thirty," Just no.
","I just can't believe how much praise this film received. Seriously. I wouldn't call this film awful though, because it's very very well made in the technical regards. But the plot is just bad. A lot of unrealistic events, as the sequence where the CIA woman was killed in the terrorist attempt. I mean, seriously? She was so desperate for her plan that she left a bunch of agents running the risk of death by an attack? Where is the professionalism? Sorry, but is just far away of what would happen in reality. And the sequence where both women were sending messages to each other before the attack was equally ridiculous. The dialog is pretty awful as well, a quick example would be the super-cliché one liner of revenge declaimed by the main character. 'Osama killed my friend, now i'll kill him.' Come on. This is so idiotic that it basically wasted single-handed all the credibility of the film, in filmmaking aspects. Not to mention that the character development is almost non-exist, so i couldn't care any less about the protagonist. But OK, the story has his own merits. The controversies about the torture methods used by the government and the CIA are by far more interesting than the so expected climax, which don't affected me at all.I don't recommend this film, because it has a bad plot and isn't entertaining at all. However, if you want to see some shocking facts about the government, though poorly dramatized, watch it. 5.5/ 10",5,3,7,24 November 2013
Crazy Heart," Way too cliché
","My major issue with 'Crazy Heart' it's the lack of creativity. The same overused story about 'a guy that was once a star in his job and is now in poverty'. And i consider lack of creativity a terrible crime. And the worst part of it is that you can predict what will happen next. As someone that already watched tons of films that explored the same subject used in that one, i simply became very bored and disappointed. It simply does not dare to show something new for the viewer.The atmosphere and at all also didn't fit at all with the country at all. The art direction made this film way too dark. The ambient just became even more depressive than it already is. The soundtrack is very weird, don't helps the fact that I'm not really a fan of that genre,but i must admit that Bridge's voice worked fine. His acting didn't do much for me, i've seen him done his acting better in other films.The only thing that really did catch my attention was how the director implied well the sex scenes. A rare thing in the 'throw in the face' world we live nowadays. It leaves for your imagination, it don't needs to be vulgar. Other films should follow that example.Anyways, i don't like it at all, it don't adds absolutely nothing to the table,but i wasn't so annoyed by watching it. So, a 6.5/10 is fair.",6,1,3,15 December 2013
12 Years a Slave," A masterpiece!
","Perhaps, Masterpiece is the appropriate term to refers to this film. A work of art that may, and must be remembered in the next years. It has the touch of a talented director and a touching, detailed script and also a great soundtrack (always with Hans Zimmer) and an exceptional cast. Some films have all these things but the result is exactly the opposite: a big disappointment. In fact, a film that has all these resources end being either a masterpiece or a disappointment. But this one you can be sure it's a masterpiece. The term sounds too pompous, I know, but I don't care. The film is what it is, and shall not be referred as anything lower. Obviously, you want to know what is so great about it, and I offered the key words, and without spoilers I'll explain why. The script don't has that much of a deeper meaning or what's ever, but it is as strong as anything else. It has a simple message, that it's delivered in a powerful way. Surmount and faith. It explains a bit the slaves mentality in the age, and there is a line in the film that explain it all – of course not going to spoil it; all I can say is that is a great one liner – that would sound cliché under other circumstances, but not in the film – why? – well, the difference is it's about real life here, fellas. The life of the protagonist, Salomon(masterfully interpreted by Chiwetel Ejiofor), it's really touching. And what it's most impressive about the story is how many details is put on it. It's even difficult to follow sometimes every single detail, but this is improved in re-watches. Faces expressions, the sounds of the insects, the breeze in the grass, the slaves cutting the reed, the sun radiating against the trees...everything is shown in details. You can even feel the land. The art direction is used carefully. The acting in general, indeed excellent. Top performances from Chiwetel Ejiofor, which literally brought Solomon to life, and brilliant in the over dramatic scenes; Michael Fassbender, that was perfect as the cold, harmless and somewhat coward villain; and Lupita Nyong'o, though she was one of the weakest in the cast, but her performance was good anyways. Also excellent were Benedict Cumberbatch, Paul Dano and the always excellent no matter what, Paul Giamatti. It no matter if it will win the Oscars or not it's already the best film of the year, and one of the best of this century, and also of all times. No kidding. Watch that film. 10/10",8,4,9,10 January 2014
There Will Be Blood," Filmmaking at it's finest! A class of story telling
","Let me say that i just re-watched this film today after a long while - I didn't cared that much about it when i first watched it, was way too over-hyped and ended being a disappointment for me, while No Country For Old Men showed to be a much more interesting and deeper film than There Will Be Blood - Well, i still thinking that, even because i had the privilege to read the books who originated both films and i have to say that No Country has a much more interesting story and complex symbolism in it.But as a film, There Will Be Blood showed to be a class of filmmaking in the talented hands of director Paul Thomas Anderson. The cinematography, the detailed life of Daniel Plainview , the acting, the weird jazz/industrial soundtrack...they all fit so well altogether that i just can say... It's a masterpiece. As a film, i must say that There Will Be Blood can be seen as a mastering of the filmmaking. It's on par with the greatest films of all time. But fine, don't want to spoil nothing here, so i can just order you to watch this film as soon as possible! 9.7/10",9,1,4,26 December 2013
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Perfect in almost all aspects.
","That's what i call a masterpiece. Everything looks perfect. The Acting is nothing less than phenomenal with the lead of the great Jack Nicholson, with also also a lot of good performances coming from the supporting roles. Everybody did his best.The script is, as well, flawless. It's extremely well-written; A great adaptation, regardless of the quality of the book(which i believe it's great) It brings a lot of discussion about human being condition x Institutions, like for example, freedom, fear, repression, rage, sadness. It's easy to see very severe critics against institutions which supposedly tries/controls everyone's willings and actions. Then, we have then these two main characters, whose personalities reflects well the result of the institutional oppressive control:'The Chief' is the man which don't accept what is imposed to him, however he don't has any courage to do the change. He prefers to play the deaf and mute instead.McMurphy is the man which questions everything; the man which the institution don't wants. He is a potential bomb. He is the only one which can make the change. The only one with courage. He fights. The 'real' great man, according to Chief.Of course, there is all the others super interesting supporting characters, like, for example, the man which does not want change,and the one which don't care for nothing,and etc etc etc. But this is for another talk.And yes, the end can be disappointing for some people, generally those which had high hopes for McMurphy. But i must say: In no other way the story would be better told. He finished the film with the picture he deserved, for sure.And in the end, we received just what is guaranteed since the first ten minutes: a great film. 9.7/10",10,1,2,1 November 2013
The Wolf of Wall Street," One of the most hilarious and ambiguous films ever
","No wonder, The Wolf of Wall Street is one of the greatest hits this year, with all the controversies going on about its content, some claiming it a feast of profanities, a film without any message and a torn of the moral values. Others, claim it to be a masterpiece, and hilarious and entertaining all the way through, some even go as far and say it's one of the greatest films ever made well, it's very subjective what is a good and what it's a bad film, the only thing we can judge and evaluate for real it's the artistic merits. And well, since that a comedy is always played for laughs, so in fact, this film deserves a thumbs up. But no wonder(as well), this film has some kind of distorted notion of morality for some people, and I really can't put the fault of them, because if this film isn't glorifying what Belfort did, it's not bashing or judging it either(like most films do with their despicable villains). It's just showing how dirty he is and how everything works. Of course, excellent acting by Leonardo Dicaprio. His performance was thunderous and powerful, required to interpret someone that was 90% of the time under the effects of cocaine. Funnily enough, I still not figured out what this film main intention is. The profanities on it is what may bother some people, since that it has really a lot of swearing, it's almost impossible to heard two lines in a row without them. I kinda liked Jonah Hill as well, he was disgusting and certainly it's his best performance by far. Everything works well into the film. But as you can see, worth noting, I still not figured out what is this film about. I hope there is something more than just showing how the dirty world of the Wall Street works. For now, it's kind of an incognita. Being said, it's a good comedy film, with some hilarious scenes, and a good watch if you don't mind with the language (if there is a real complaint about this film, language is it, for sure, and I find worth noting to say that it's really strong). 8.9/10",8,3,10,17 January 2014
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Incoherent, disappointing effort
","Dracula clearly had potential to be a great film. Excellent source material, an excellent director and a excellent cast. Which more is needed, right? Unfortunately, nothing works. The adaptation of the classic book to the film is mediocre at best. The story came in pieces, and is absolutely incoherent further first viewing, that is the most important. It improves upon a second viewing, mostly because you can pay attention to other aspects of the film which is impossible to do with the consistent cuts and scenes rising out of nowhere in first viewing.Still, there are totally nonsense scenes (the cemetery scene is a prime example) in the film that are there for whatever reason. The film captures one of the most important aspects in the book, that is the ambient, the erotic and romantic atmosphere contrasting with the horrific monsters and the dark, Gothic tone given by the excellent art direction. The visual effects tough, are outdated and horrible, it is even awful at times.The acting, apart for the good performance by Gary Oldman, is average and even mediocre at times. Winona Ryder is pretty disappointing in it. Keanu Reeves it's in one of his best performances here, and still that's not saying too much. Anthony Hopkins is meh, neither good nor bad, just mildly convincing. The first sequence, explaining how 'Draculia' turns in 'Dracula' has one of the worst acting efforts I've seen in a long while. But despite that, it's not as big as a problem as the editing is. Frankly, it's a disappointing film mostly because it had everything to be a great and big one. It seems that everything was done badly and in the laziest and campy way possible. A shame. One of Coppola's weakest efforts. 5.7/10",6,1,2,10 January 2014
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Over the top silly
","This film is perhaps one of the silliest films ever made. Nothing in it can be taken serious or whats ever. There its just massive sequences of silly, childish and absurd scenes going on. Yeah, it's funny in about...60% of the time? But sure, there is nothing more added in this film. A strong critic against the TV News, perhaps? Also, some jokes sounds way too forced and not funny at all (The famous 'Fart Jokes, frequently used in the Judd Apatow's works or related material). The characters are way too dumb and silly for my taste. This coming from a big fan of super-silly comedies. Seriously. It' almost tiring to see that much of cartoon-ish characters sharing the same place on the screen. Yes, it has his Laugh out Load moments, more than one, guarantee. The cameos were remarkable moments as well. But this is all which you'll find funny in this film(Unless if you are a fan of this Judd Apatow kind of comedy, so you'll probably pee in your pants laughing). 6.9/10",7,0,0,31 October 2013
Raging Bull," A modern classy masterpiece.
","With a flawless plot, and being arguably one of the best films from the 80s, Raging Bull tells the story of the raise to fame and the decadence of Jake La Motta, a man that is guided by his totally animal-like and impulsive personality. It's a very interesting story, i must say. The idea of making a film about Jake was brought by DeNiro himself, which tried numerous times to convince Scorsese to do the film. Scorsese, in fact, just accepted to do the film after knowing that he could relate himself with Jake.In the technical aspects of filmmaking, this film is nothing less than great. The cinematography of the fights sequences are breath- taking. Super stylized and very different from the spectator's experience, we have a view of the fight into the ring, with a fast and very well- made edition in these sequences. And a curious fact: one of the film's main reason to be filmed in black and white was because that the colors of the gloves at the time would have only been with dark tones, such as oxblood and even black.The acting is superb. The then relatively unknown Joe Pesci gives an extraordinary performance as Joey, the Jake's brother. DeNiro was without a doubt great, his dedication to the role leads him to a weight increase from 145 to 215 pounds (66 to 97 kg) to portray the post-boxing life of Jake. He also choreographed the fight scenes with the help of the real Jake La Motta. Not surprisingly, his job in the portrayal of Jake La Motta brought to him an Academy Award of best actor in a lead role.I can proudly say that this film is without a doubt one of my favorites of the 80s. So, Highly recommended. 9.4/10",9,2,2,12 November 2013
The Silence of the Lambs," Slightly disturbing and with very good acting
","Silence of the Lambs is highly acclaimed as one of the best films ever made into the thriller genre, and in fact deserves this title. There are plenty of films like these nowadays, so the formula may be a bit cliché in fact, but the film itself still unique in his own way. Hannibal Lecter is a very intelligent man and at same time a dangerous psychopath, so normally the actor that would eventually take the role should put effort in bringing exactly what Hopkins's acting did. In Lecter skin, he looks like a creepy but classy individual, and one could argue that this kind of thing is very hard to accomplish. I found him to be almost an untouchable and invincible character, and if you watch the film you'll understand. I am not entirely convinced by 'that' scene(those who watched the film know what i am talking about), despite being very impressive. I also liked Jodie Foster in the film. Her performance in this film is good, not one of the 'Greatest Ever' but very convincing. If the intention was to show a character that is slightly scared all the time so she did very well, because it was exactly my impression about her.There are some harsh dialogs and situations in this film that may engross and even left the viewer uncomfortable, but still surprisingly tame for a film that explores the subjects it did.It don't have that much accomplished in the artistic aspects, but the story-telling is very good. And even with a few poorly made scenes(Jodie Foster calling 'Dr Lecter?' numerous times in the phone), it still a fine interesting film. 8.5/10",8,0,1,27 December 2013
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Very good and enjoyable Allen's film!
","'Vicky Cristina Barcelona' is the second installment of the 'european sage' which started in London, England with Match Point, then goes to Barcelona, Spain with Vicky Cristina Barcelona, then followed by Paris, France with the hit Midnight in Paris and it's last installment being set in Rome, Italy, with To Rome with Love(the weakest in my opinion). The story follows the life of a fiancée woman and his friend, that goes to vacation in Barcelona. Then they met Luis Antonio, a seductive painter that wants to have a -guess what - three way relationship with them. The story starts crazy as you, then it just became even crazier until the end of the film, that has the classic existentialist Allen's ending. But beyond the very good story full of unpredictable moments, this film is also rich in the technical aspects. The art direction is very good, it portrays the ambient with 'hot' colors, such as yellow, orange and soft red lightning all over Spain. The soundtrack is also very good. Penelope Cruz did a very good job as the crazy ex- wife of Luis Antonio, and well deservedly won the Oscar for her supporting performance.Good, entertaining and smart film. Worth a watch. 8.0/10",8,1,2,20 December 2013
The Deer Hunter," It's all about repressed sexuality
","This film is not about war. This film is entirely about repressed sexuality. Impressive to know how so many people don't get that Michael was a repressed gay. Not jokes. Remember in the beginning of the film, when the guy calls him gay because of Michael's weird behavior in relation to women? This was the first hint. The other hint was the allegory of the deer. As we all know, the deer became known in the popular culture for representing the 'homossexual'. Michael was pretending all time that he was a man by being the best in killing deers, which may represents 'killing his repressed homosexuality'. This happened before the war. He needed to kill the deers, while his friends did it for 'fun'. Nicki also has a gay side, he is the other who takes 'killimg dears' very serious, and definitely liked Michael as a lover, but he don't how to deal with it. This 'homossexual' side in Michael always left him uncomfortable, we can see how closed and cautious he is in relation to other people. He don't understand why he has this 'homo' side, so this is why his behavior is likely shy when he is with other people.After the war, he understands that he can't kill the deers anymore. This represents a transformation on his life, he is not repressing his feelings anymore. He starts to accept what he is.This also explain why people are so embarrassed when they are talking to him in the ending of the film. His friends did avoid to look at him when he was talking to them, but they are always looking at him at his back. Definitely thats was the situation of the homosexuals back in the 70s.Also, 'The Game' played in the film only represents the 'will' of the gays about their situation. As we can see, both Michael andNicki are repressed lovers. The death game represented the constant situation of their minds. In one side, the will of life but the inevitable need to repress the feelings, and the other side was simply die. For Nicki, the latter option fitted better after his agony.Anyways, that is what i think of this film. It is really weird to know that almost no one got this message. 8.3/10",8,0,1,10 December 2013
Amélie," Good visuals, but way too clichéd and boring story
","I really wanted to like that film. I heard a lot of good things about it, plus it had a good presence in the Oscars in 2002(I don't know if anyone cares, but I think it's worth noting) so I finally watched it. And I realized it wasn't impressive. First thing that bothered me was the narrator. It was insufferable bad. I don't like that kind of narrator at all. It looked like I was reading a book instead of watching the film. The worst part is that it really wants to look like a book. The narrative is also weird. Also don't liked at all the stylized editing. It cuts the story way too much, and there is always a lot of things going on. Thankfully the editing is less frequently used. The themes used – introversion, charity – are certainly interesting, but the approach made in the film isn't appealing nor strong enough to make a big impression. In the end, is just a romance story of a 'late' girl that finds in the introversion and in the fantasy(her biggest allies) are now troubling and ruining her life. It certainly has a good message _ but, a good message don't means good film or whats ever. Even because this film is mostly bad executed, at least in it first half.But obviously, this film is fantastic technically. The cinematography is top notch, full of gorgeous moments, and the art direction is equally excellent. The abundant use of green suggests a sheltering aspect in the ambient, and also a weird nature in the atmosphere. The actress Audrey Tautou did very well and fitted almost that perfectly the introvert female protagonist. Really worth-noting. She seems that was born just to bring to life the Amelie character.But anyways, the story, while seems to be original, looks like it was told one million times before. We know that she is going to face her introvert problem and finally find her love. But while it's depiction of an introvert life seems top notch, it use isn't the best– it has no impact in the way it's told. Thankfully to –worth noting – the editing (an underrated aspect that is essential to any film). A better approach and this film could have been much better. Unfortunately the world isn't made by 'Ifs' and 'maybes' so it's fair to give it a 7.3/10.",7,1,6,10 January 2014
Moonrise Kingdom," Creative story
","Moonrise Kingdom is a good film. Not great but a good one. I watched only film made by director Wes Anderson previously and it was Darjeeling Limited back in 2007, a good film, recommended, but I am not at all familiar with his style of work. Now, talking about that film, I want to say there is something peculiar about Moonrise Kingdom, firstly the eccentricity of the characters. They're not conventional in any way, and the acting make them looks even more like caricatures. And I didn't like it, in fact, despite the cast being full of great and known names, like Bruce Willis, Ed Norton, Frances McDormand, Bill Murray and even a few cameos of also known actors, but the truth is that character-wise(if that makes sense), I don't liked it at all. The acting was weak, in other words. But what drew my attention in fact, was the story. Not only because it's weird, but it's also because this is one of the rarest films that you can tell that the characters don't makes the story, but the story makes the characters. It's crazy. I also was impressed with the loads of symbiotic elements on it and notably a harsh critic against the world. There are unusual scenes of violence and some sexuality between the teens that you mostly don't see in films of the genre, is not trivialized, but still shocking from what the film seems to be. I also thought that the cinematography had some kind of 'nostalgic' feeling. You know, some of the manual zooms and the angles of some scenes resembles the films from the 70s, a decade where was common the use of this technique. I think it's one of the greatest films from 2012, so it's worth watching. It's not great, but worth your time and even a re-watch. 8.1/10",8,2,3,22 January 2014
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," A film for intelligent and open minded people.
","Hunger Games is clearly one of the best films of the year, and without a doubt it's an excellent film. I must say that it's finally a breath of fresh air in this fast food generation of people that only bothers to go to theaters to see things exploding and an insane use of CGI on every single shot. Not saying that HG: Catching Fire has nothing of this; of course it has, but i am only saying that it bothers in also pledging the viewer with a good and intelligent story. Though nothing in it is subtle or anything, but still a great mental satisfaction to watch it.I must say that it is the only serious and compromised blockbuster done since The Dark Knight. Of course, is not that hard either to make a story with more content than 'The avengers' or 'Thor 2', but again , is a great breath of fresh air and it definitely has an above average storytelling for nowadays established standards.I simply loved the references to the Roman Empire on it, such as the fact that the rich people threw up to can taste all the types of food in the party, while the poor people were starving fighting for a piece of bread. I also liked how a new and entirely fictional world can offers such a strong allegory to OUR real solid world. The allegory presented in this film shows the human history since day one, until perhaps nowadays, or even until a near future. In fact, we can see and remind through this film that nothing really changed in the political aspects, because since the days where Rome was a great and powerful Empire, there was tyranny, internal treason and people were always unhappy and poor, though they also were the vast majority. And yeah, sadly this still happening. Again, politically nothing changed. Maybe the thing that really changed was the standards of tyranny and unhappiness, but's all. This sad fate probably won't change in a 'technological' future either. So, as you can see, HG:Catching Fire puts altogether the medieval times, the present times and a probably futuristic time, doing a great reflection about our civilization. The film also criticizes the strong media manipulation, who is blatantly true nowadays. So, a improbably hero, or better, heroin(to emphasize even more the idea of revolution) rises to put an end in all the tyranny and to give the power to the people. Fantastic.Talking about the cast, Jennifer Lawrence is the one who is definitely on fire. She is such a talented actress, and is doing one of the best runs ever made by such a young actress. As you see, the combination of good looking skills plus real talent and the right choices of films is turning her in a superstar of cinema and obviously she has a great effect on the box offices of a film, something that really few actresses could do. Woody Harrelson is once again priceless. He definitely adds his crazy acting style to the film, even expanding it's horizons. He definitely steals the scene, even if Jennifer Lawrence or the great Phillip Seymour Hoffman are in the same scene as him. The best actor in the film, in my opinion.The only couple of things that bothered me were the dialogs, which sometimes were dull, and some cheesy moments in the first sequences of the film. I also don't understood why the protagonist cried so much, but maybe she was just hyper sensitive or whatever. Still, it did hold me back when i was going to give it a perfect 10/10. Anyways, the rest is absolutely top notch.All in all, an excellent film. Those who have a brain will appreciate this piece of art. 9.0/10",8,4,23,4 December 2013
Casino," One of the worst films by Martin Scorsese
","I am not the biggest fan of Martin Scorsese at all, in fact, I don't like him and I think he is a tad overrated, and this film is a proof of why I think that way about him. It's a bad film that no supposedly 'great' director would do. It's a film moved by nothing. Seriously, there is no point to make that film. It looks like a worsened version of Goodfellas, that frankly also wasn't that great. There is the crazy Joe Pesci yelling and killing people and the quiet and conscious but also despicable Robert DeNiro. In fact, it can be considered a reprise of their roles. But unlike Goodfellas, that has an intelligent narration an is so over the top that you even laugh at some scenes, Casino has no redeem value or whats or ever. Is a mess. It's so predictable and so repetitive. Why should I spent three hours of my time to see things that were not only made before a lot of times, but made way better before, after all? It is not worthy watching at all. Not mentioning the fact that the film is ugly as hell, it has no art value and it looks like those low budget films made in the 70s. Total fiasco. The music was great, oh yeah, some great stuff on it. But it was all over the place. I merely believe how bad the music was on this film. But if the music was that bad it was because of the editing. One of the worst that I've ever seen in a 'big' film. Seriously, who are the editors of this film? What a lazy work. What they are thinking? I mean, what they are thinking? And the art direction was so tasteless, it looks like *rap. Sorry for the swearing, but it is literally what I meant to say. I know that the intention of the sparkling colors in the ambient was to make the bandits looks even more extravagant and repugnant than they already were, but it couldn't have been done in a better way? Well, I totally think so. I'm not even bothered by the horrible and senseless script, since that there is things much worse than that in the film. Anyway, it succeeds in passing the intended message, that is to show how dirty and how works the casino's world, but the rest, is a mess. The only good thing about it was Sharon Stone, that was by far the best actress in the film. 4.5/10",4,3,11,22 January 2014
Inside Llewyn Davis," Coen's best since No Country for Old Men
","Inside Llewyn Davis can be rightfully so considered one of the greatest films released in 2013. As usual, another Coen's great film. The film tells the story of Llewyn Davis, an apparently good singer that somewhat is considered horrible. He has no direction in his life, but he wants to be a folk-music singer. And this is where the film starts. The coens decided to put a more comedic/musical approach in this film, and it was a spot on choice. It has hilarious moments and one liners, it reminds me a lot of the comedy cult-classic The Big Lebowski, and in the way it looks, Inside Llewyn Davis is walking in that same Cult-Classic way. And rightfully so, it has a beautiful and extremely funny story, full of deeper meanings, symbiotic elements (typical in Coens's films) and totally deserves to be watched.Oscar Isaacs is surprisingly good as Llewyn Davis, great acting performance. He is really funny, and his unusual way turns even a relatively normal scene in an hilarious one. It's a hard thing to accomplish. Llewyn is the kind of character that makes you laugh just by looking at him and his reactions. A great work. And of course, I think I already said that the one-liners were great. But an aspect that I really want to congratulate is the cinematography/art direction. One of the best that I've seen in a long while. No kidding. The color's scheme and the lightning a la Noir films, the unusual camera angles, I mean, just look at the gallery scene and the tight space between the door of Llewyn's apartment and his neighbor's apartment, and how that image may have an symbiotic importance. There is really no scene in this film that is like 'oh let's do a great cinematography on that scene just for the sake of it'. No, there is always a reason for the things to be in the way they are.There are other examples as well, like in the 'bust scene' where Llewyn is in the car trying to figure out a solution for his problems, and starts to look everywhere, so as you see in that scene, the night set is terrific and even resembles a bit some kind of Gothic atmosphere. The cinematography is really great and stands out almost as an Oscar-winner work, definitely a top 5 of 2013 in that aspect. Anyways, everything in this film is great, so is really hard to talk about it without paying a compliment. So, what more can I say? Go watch it as soon as possible. 9.5/10",9,2,4,22 January 2014
Her," Beautiful story, carefully build
","I wanted to congratulate Spike Jonze for doing a film like that. What a piece of art. Everything works wonderfully well, the direction, the acting, the sets, the music, all great. They complement each other in a way that the film wouldn't be the same if one of these things were worse or different. And it may be not 'that' original, the script is not like the 'most unthinkable thing ever' to do, but overall it's a unique film, in its own way. The art design and the cinematography were great. I almost cried just by watching so many beautiful and wonderfully treated images. Phenomenal. The lightning was mostly neutral, and the colors looked cold and distant, like in some kind of 'dead nature' color scheme, using a lot of bright gray all over it. As I said earlier, everything works extremely well in the film, and the art design is not an exception. The thing about this film it's the atmosphere, which in fact is great, you have no choice other than contemplate the view.The editing is great, yes. It may be something that you see in every commercial in MTV, but who cares anyways? It's wonderful, and adds a different dynamic to the film. Plus, it's something different from most films. The acting by Phoenix is great. He is alone most of the time in this film, only in the company of Scarlett Johansson's voice. He did perfectly the job. The result was a fragile and delicate character well build and extremely natural and charismatic in his own way. Johansson did a good job in the voice over, worth noting. Anyways, sorry for not giving any deepest details about the film But it's for a good cause. I really don't want to throw any spoiler here, because the less you know about it, the better. The experience is great. If you really want to watch a great film, different from most of the ones released nowadays, Her is a safe watch. My #1 film of the year. 9.8/10",10,1,4,17 January 2014
The Breakfast Club," The quintessential 80s film
","The Breakfast Club is a mark in cinema history? Yes. The so popular genre, the teenager genre, which explores the teenager world through stereotypes, became widely popular in the 80s - and still is- and the vast majority of the films in this particular genre shows Nerds being ridiculed and bullied by the popular guys...the 'bad' teacher....a girl that wants to be popular and date the popular guy...etc etc etc. And the great majority of these teenager films are comedies involving parties and lots of sexual references. Basically this is what the genre is about. But then, we have Breakfast Club. The film is the examination and study of these stereotypes. There isn't one dimensional characters here. Its the anti thesis of the normal Teenager genre, and I say, the end of them all. We still have films about teenagers produced nowadays, but we know that the genre ended when Breakfast Club was released back in 1985. A film that chooses to explain the characters instead of robotizing them.The Breakfast Club is for the teenager films what Once Upon a Time in the West was for the western genre. The definitive end. And what an ending. 9.0/10",9,5,7,11 March 2014
Goodfellas," It glorifies treason and criminals - yet, 8.8 here in IMDb.
","What a joke. Aesthetically the film is without a doubt one of the best films made, but plot and acting-wise(excluding DeNiro) it was annoying and mediocre. And it glorifies criminals and treason.That is one of the reasons I find the recent The Wolf of Wall Street better. And it indeed is. Ray Liotta's voice was cringe worthy and weird. DiCaprio's was smooth, soft, and sounded much more natural. And is totally a sarcastic and ironic film.So thats it. Fanboys will say that I missed the point and so on, but in the reality THEY missed the point. The film is about glorifying criminals. Obviously, if you want a class of filmmaking and insanely awesome camera-work, editing, cinematography etc. so you shall watch this film. Scorsese is great, but he usually waste his talent in lame stories.7/10",10,0,3,25 April 2014
The Great Gatsby," Over the top stylized film
","I was thinking about making a proper comment about The Great Gatsby(2013, worth to remember that there is two oldest films based on the novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald ), then i just realized that stylish modern french-wave romance would be a perfect definition for this film. Stylized, perhaps is a word that causes eeks in some cinema conservatives, and this kind of 'stylized' films nowadays tend to be received with a strange low brow and bigotry by the critics, which not for coincidence dislike this film. While i agree that in some parts the fact that this film inexplicably starts to play contemporary rap instead of playing a common music from the 50s is kinda weird, the quick frenetic editing, also criticized by some for being way too frenetic, it is nothing new in cinema. In fact, it was inspired in an old very known style of films: the french new wave, which one of the most notorious characteristics were the utilization of quick editing almost every time to constantly reminds the viewer that he is watching a film, contrasting with the super blockbusters by Hollywood, who managed to put the viewer as close as possible to the characters and to the film itself. This trick was used in The Great Gatsby, and it totally fits the story the crazy special effects and also the beautiful cinematography. Cinematography is indeed good in this film, it is really made in a way that you can even feel the ambient, and also to delight the panoramic shots of the Manhattan island in external and internal views.But despite all this effort in taking our attention constantly away from the film, Gatsby's story is really interesting, and you really want to know the secrets he keeps and the why of everything. The 'cause' in question couldn't be more cheesy in a romance film _ A Woman _ and he is entirely moved by his passion for that woman. But this is not a conventional romance story, despite the fact that it really looks like one. In the end, Gatsby was the heart of NY. If he was good or not, does not matter.A recommended film, though not for everyone. 7.0/10",7,0,2,1 December 2013
The Birds," A thrilling film.
","Birds is a good and very different film for his purpose, but it fails a lot in very basic levels to be considered a great one. Some special effects are super-outdated, honestly it's very awful if compared to nowadays standards(which is obvious). But is obviously as well that i can't blame a film made in 1963 by having bad visual effects. I would be a jerk if i do such thing. Anyways, it's laughably bad. The major problems that i find in this movie are all located in the second half. Some pointless and incomprehensible actions by the characters really annoyed me. Troubles variated since bad editing to mediocre acting. Some of these problems really disappointed me, because i was sure that this movie was going to be great, due to a excellent first hour. But with such big flaws, it can't be considered nothing more than a good film. Shame. But despite some awful and bad planed/executed sequences, the film as a whole it's not so bad in that quest. I was quite satisfied with the birds 'motivations' to the attacks, for example. Also, the great character development is fundamental to the film 'finale' effect, and the dialogues are also very good. To finish, If i had to make a balance, the first half would be a 9.5 and the second half would be something around 5 or 6. Overall, a 7.7/10 is enough.",8,2,5,28 October 2013
Valkyrie," May do a good popcorn flick.
","Valkyrie is an average watchable film. Nothing more or less. Set during WWII in Germany, is really a well made film technically. The plot is simple: it's about the great execution of a conspiracy plan to free the Germany from the terrible dictator Adolph Hitler. Unfortunately for the involved on it, the plan don't works as they expected. And although accurate and somewhat entertaining, the technical aspects of the film are worth mentioning a bit more than the story itself.The art design is a little messed up with the strong day lightning but is overall good. The cinematography is also good. Elegant camera-work such as cranes were used as the plot builds to the attempt on Hitler's life, and the second half is frantic with hand-held cinematography as the plotters are hunted down. Singer chose to shoot in 1:85 aspect ratio, and since filming took place in Germany, the director used Arriflex cameras with Zeiss lenses.The colors in the film also become more intense as the story continues. Sigel focused on red, the color of the Nazi flag, which he felt represented the violence of their ideology. Singer looked towards thrillers of the 1940s and home movies shot by Eva Braun for inspiration. Shooting scenes at night was difficult because presenting historical accuracy of the era required blackouts. Sigel noted in real life, car headlights were used for the firing squad to aim at and execute the plotters in the Bendlerblock.If you are planning to watch this film, it's for you to decide. It is watchable and well made, but don't adds nothing 'filmographically' talking. 7.0/10May do a good popcorn flick.",7,0,0,19 November 2013
All the President's Men," A prime example of a simple but effective film
","All the President's men is definitely a good film on it's own. It's not the conventional thriller , keep that in mind. Obviously it may have not all the impact it had back in 70s, but still a pretty good, entertaining film and the best of it's press-thriller sub- genre(if that exists).It's after all, a film that will interest those who wants to know how worked the process that did lead the then president Nixon to resign. Yeah, it's about the infamous Watergate scandal. I don't want to spoil the film, so you have to definitely check it out. Hoffman and Redford are superb in their roles and carried very well this film. It's also interesting to see how the press work. The art direction is also very good, and the script is itself flawless, free of plot holes. Jason Robards is nothing less than excellent interpreting Benjamin Crowninshield 'Ben' Bradlee, the man who 'challenged the government'. The editing also plays a very good part in the film.Definitely worth a watch. 7.7/10",8,1,1,22 December 2013
The Soloist," Watchable if you are interested in the subject
","The soloist is an average film, with very few to offers besides a mental illness exploitation story. It begins with Robert Downey character's trying to help Jamie Foxx character's,and there is it. No conflicts in the story at all, or at least decent ones, and the strongest conflicts in the story barely affect the story or the viewer. Is just... cold. I have nothing against schizophrenic homeless musicians, but that kind of film is not interesting, isn't appellative, unless if you put a lot of effort on it and turn it in a fictional film. As you can see, that is not the case with this film. I had also major problems with the acting, since that i couldn't feel nothing about the characters. However it maybe kinda unfair to put the fact only in the actors, since that the character development is this film is messy, confused and lazy. Foxx overacted and almost looked like a autistic man instead of a schizophrenic man.As a plus, this film brings interesting and shocking data about the streets of L.A. The number of homeless persons living in the great L.A streets is disturbingly high. But apart from that, the film is uninteresting. 6.4/10",6,0,1,26 November 2013
The Fighter," An inspiring film about overcoming
","David O. Russell did The Fighter in 2010 and probably he did it in the best way possible, since that I generally don't like that much 'Sports' films. I think it's because he, as example of Scorsese in 1980 with his masterpiece Raging Bull, focused more in the story, the character, than in the sport itself. And Is the best way of tell a story, obviously. The protagonist is a loser, and so is his brother and basically all the people around him. Not to be rude with the real 'people', but is in that way the film shows them. A bunch of struggled people trying to win in life and overcome the difficulties. And that is the main idea of the film. I really loved almost everything about this film. It has a captivating story, great music fitting with the ambient, exceptional acting, I mean, Christian Bale was great, Melissa Leo also was great, but in a lesser extent...and I even liked Mark Wahlberg, whose style I honestly don't care for in all the films I've seen with him. He fitted in the protagonist role. Being said the supporting actors simply stole the film. Oh, and Amy Adams was also good, but honestly I wished her presence to be stronger.Anyway, there isn't a lot to be said in a quick review about this film, other than it's amazing, filled with great performances and with a great atmosphere. It's character study at it's best. Highly recommended. 8.6/10",9,0,1,18 February 2014
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," May be not so Coen, but is a great film anyways
","I definitely loved this film. It's just as perfect as a film can get. Some can say that this is not a 'Real' Coen film, but who cares when a film is good as this one? Everything is just flawless. The plot is way lighthearted for a Coen film, it's really the kind of film that follows the arc 'the protagonist suffer,suffer, and in the end he met happiness'. Similar arc with the Odissey of Homer, whose book was used here as the mainly inspiration for the film. Obviously, the name of the protagonist is indeed the same in both O Brother Where Are Thou and in the Odissey: Ulysses.The acting in almost all the Coen's films are phenomenal and over the top, and this repeat itself here in this film. Great job by Turturro and Clooney, which held the lead of the film and did very well. The cinematography by Roger Adkins, and as well the art design, are essential to build the dread and sunset ambient of the south. Really deserved Oscar nomination for it.And how to not talk about the fantastic music in the film? It really left speechless. Music in the film was originally conceived as a major component of the film, not merely as a background or a support. Noted producer and musician T- Bone Burnett worked with the Coens while the script was still in its working phases, and the soundtrack was recorded before filming commenced.The 'Soggy Bottom Boys' singing 'Man of Constant Sorrow'.Much of the music used in the film is period-specific folk music, including that of Virginia bluegrass singer Ralph Stanley. The musical selection also includes religious music, including Primitive Baptist and traditional African-American gospel, most notably the Fairfield Four, an a cappella quartet with a career extending back to 1921 who appear in the soundtrack and as gravediggers towards the film's end. Selected songs in the film reflect the possible spectrum of musical styles typical of the old culture of the American South gospel, delta blues, country, swing and bluegrass. There is a notable use of dirges and other macabre songs, a theme that often recurs in Appalachian music ('O Death,' 'Lonesome Valley,' 'Angel Band,' 'I Am Weary') in contrast to bright, cheerful songs ('Keep On the Sunnyside,' 'In the Highways') in other parts of the film.The voices of the Soggy Bottom Boys were provided by Dan Tyminski (lead vocal on 'Man of Constant Sorrow'), Nashville songwriter Harley Allen, and the Nashville Bluegrass Band's Pat Enright. The three won a CMA Award for Single of the Year and a Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals, both for the song 'Man of Constant Sorrow.' Tim Blake Nelson sang the lead vocal on 'In the Jailhouse Now'.'Man of Constant Sorrow' has five variations: two are used in the film, one in the music video, and two in the soundtrack. Two of the variations feature the verses being sung back-to-back, and the other three variations feature additional music between each verse. Though the song received little significant radio airplay, it reached #35 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart in 2002. The version of 'I'll Fly Away' heard in the film is performed not by Krauss and Welch (as it is on the CD and concert tour), but by the Kossoy Sisters with Erik Darling accompanying on long-neck 5-string banjo, recorded in 1956 for the album Bowling Green on Tradition Records.Tommy, the lead guitarist of the Soggy Bottom Boys, is an intentional reference to the legend of Delta Blues artist Tommy Johnson, who claimed to have sold his soul to the devil in return for blues fame.So, what you are expecting? Go watch it now! 9.6/10",8,0,0,21 November 2013
