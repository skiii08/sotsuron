Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The only problem with this film is that it didn't have enough Darth Maul
","Star Wars Episode 1 has been bashed by bad comments through out the years. Well I just happened to re-watch the film and I must say I think it is a great film! Liam Neeson is the perfect Jedi leader with Ewan as Obi Wan who plays the part well. And I can't believe I'm saying this but I actually liked the character Jar Jar Binks. Jack Lloyd made a fair act playing the young Darth Vader, Anakin Skywalker. The Queen is cool and Padme is sweet, plus Palpatine is very crafty with his duel persona as the Sith lord Darth Sideous. Now this film wasn't perfect for one thing, one of the coolest Star Wars villains has only ten minutes of screen time in the entire picture. Darth Maul was a great henchman, his role was perfect for the film. Plus he looked great with the horns and he had the two sided lightsabre. The last battle between him and the two Jedi's is great too! I liked the pod race with Anakin and the droid battle with Jar Jar. But there are times you can tell the film is real hokey, just look at Yoda. Plenty of times he's on screen he looks like a puppet. Samuel L. Jackson is good as Windu who you see later in the saga, putting on a good role. The plot is twisted a lot but works with the Queen being in danger of being destroyed by a droid army sent out by the Sith. The acting is done greatly and the special affects are the same, breath taking. This is a good Star Wars film and a good way to kick off the first episode of the prequel trilogy, highly recommended. Star Wars Episode 1 gets the big 9, only a notch away from being perfect like Parts 4 and 5. Enjoy!",9,0,1,2 July 2005
The Longest Yard," This film proves not all remakes are bad
","When I saw The Longest Yard I was really entertained by all the action, comedy, and football tactics going around. Adam Sandler has outdone himself playing the ex-quarterback Paul 'Wrecking' Crewe, Chris Rock did a good job on portraying the assistant coach Caretaker, and straight from the original Longest Yard is the legend Burt Reynolds playing the coach. Along with the main actors is James Cromwell who plays Warden Hazard, and I just have to say he is not as tough as the original Hazen but he still plays the part well, plus we have Courtney Cox in the opening as Paul's girlfriend. Now the whole football team is another story. Bob Sapp is hilarious 'I love little Michael.', Brucie is amusing ' Dear God please help me kick this ball and I promise I'll stop cheating on my wife with black men.', we have Bill Goldberg as Hammer and wait till you see the actor who plays Turley! The guards are all played mean and evil, I liked Steve Austins performance. Sure this film doesn't beat the original but it beats a lot of other remakes. This film is hilarious with action and comedy rolled up into the main football game, wait till you see Rob Schnieders cameo ' You can do it!' This film gets the big 8, great remake.",8,1,3,26 June 2005
Wayne's World," It's Wayne's world, party time, excellent!
","This has to be the best Saturday Night Live sketch turned movie ever, unless you count Waynes World 2. Mike Myers and Dana Carvey have a great on screen chemistry together and they both bring life to their wacky characters. Watch for cameos by great actors including Ed O'Neil, Chris Farley, and on. This film doesn't really have a plot, it's more like a longer version of the original sketch with a pompous t.v. producer wanting the two dudes to put their show on cable. Wayne has fallen over heels for a band girl while he is being annoyed by a girl he broke up with long ago and Garth is in love with a drum set, stair way to heaven! No matter how much you try not to laugh, you can't stop yourself from at least giggling from this film. The whole idea of Wayne and Garth talking to the camera, genius! The Bohemain Rhapsody sequence, the best scene in the whole movie with the best band in the whole world is great while you can't help yourself but jam to the song as well as the actors, the scene where Garth talks to the audience about an episode of the Twilight Zone... cool huh? This movie has reached great heights about sketch comedies. This blasts Blue Brothers out of the water, so do yourself a favor and check out this totally awesome video! It's Waynes world, party time, excellent!",8,0,1,25 June 2005
Shaun of the Dead," Shaun: a boring, everyday...zombie killer?

Now to save his life and his relationship with everyone around him Shaun and his flatmate friend Ed must go up against blood thirsty zombies, save him mom, make peace with his step dad, save his girlfriend Liz, and hold up in a near by Pub with the safety of a cricket bat.Shaun of the Dead is a instant classic. You'll love the mix of horror and comedy along with the sad family issues. Aside from the jokes is the gore, that's right gore in a zombie love story! Spoilers: gory parts include when David gets grabbed by thousands of zombies outside the pub and gets ripped apart, a homage to Day of the Dead, Shaun blowing zombies heads open with a gun, Shaun getting a dart in the head...ouch, and so on.

Rocky V," A classic saga ends on a good note
","I've heard a lot of rumors about Rocky V. Mostly they all have the same message, the film is bad! Well I recently saw Rocky V and I must say I enjoyed it greatly.Sly returns as the boxer Rocky who retires from the ring after his victory match against Drago from Part 4. But when he returns he learns he has brain damage. Sadly for him, the mortgage takes back all his fortunes including his house, car, money, etc. because of Uncle Pauly.The Balboa family is sent back to Philadolphea to live in the slums like Rocky did in the beginning of the original Rocky. There Rocky's son must adjust to rough gangs beating on him but can't do anything because his dad is training a amateur boxer by the name of Tommy Gunn. Rocky Jr. joins a gang and Gunn leaves Rocky for a flashy Don King Promoter by the name of George Washington Duke. Rocky has to get use to the stab in his back as he is called out by Gunn for a life threatening street fight outside a bar. There Rocky must choose between fighting or running.Much of the cast returns including the great Burgess Meredith as Micky.The film is the weakest in the Rocky series but it is not as bad as people say it is. I think this film ended a good saga of boxing. If you enjoyed the other installments of the Rocky series, don't listen to the bad reviews. Check the movie out and enjoy.",6,6,8,23 June 2005
Stripes," This is a fact Jack, Stripes is a good movie!
","Stripes starring Bill Murray and Harold Ramis has a low life named John Winger and his friend join the army after their lives go down the tube in two hours. Under the order of Sgt. Hulka, the army under goes a five week training class till Hulka is in an accident. This causes John to train his team before graduation, and at graduation his team performs gun marches that wows the whole supreme. They are so good, they are assigned to look after a top secret military truck that John takes into his own hands and has his team kidnapped. Now it's up to him and a few friends to rescue his platoon!Now my first impression of the film, could of been better. The cast is made perfectly but there are to many nudity jokes and slow scenes that drags this film by the roots. But that doesn't stop Bill to stop being funny. He gives a great performance as Winger who doesn't care what happens to him in the army. Harold does a good job acting as the careful and hectic best friend Russell but the best person in this whole movie is John Candy as Dewey 'Ox' Oxburger. His scene at the strip club in the mud wrestling pit is priceless. 'I'm a lean, mean, fighting machine!' This film may drag but it reaches it's goal with a good supply of action, tons of one liners that work, and love relations between two MP's and the two stars. The whole plot at the beginning switches totally when Bill and his platoon have to guard the army vehicle but the real action is in this sequence. You'll love the ending with the newspaper headlines in magazines like Penthouse and Romance Finders. Stripes gets the big 7, could of been better but it works in it's own way. Now that's the fact Jack, go out and watch a copy of Stripes! You'll love it, enjoy.",7,0,0,28 June 2005
Madagascar," Only for kinds under 5
","When going to see Madagascar I was expecting a clever comedy like Finding Nemo but all I saw was a pile of stupid jokes and little kid humor. Sure there are a few adult jokes which involve words like hell and sucks, but that's about it. To me this movie was a waste of time. Shame on Chris Rock and Ben Stiller for being in this movie. Such good talent wasted in a very mediocre movie.The jokes are lame, the plot is dumb, and none of the main characters are funny. Only the penguins got a chuckle out of me and that was it. Look, if your an adult don't see this film! If you have kids under five, take them to see it and you can catch a few winks of sleep while they enjoy themselves. I give this film a three only for the penguins and the adult jokes.",3,2,8,23 June 2005
Spider-Man 2," Great film, great sequel, great everything
","Spider-Man set the bar the first time it came out a few years ago. I knew how the films sequel had to be made to be better then the first film and that's hard to do when the first film rocked. But when I saw Spider-Man Part 2, I was blown away! Peter Parker is having a hard time. He just got fired from his pizza delivery job, he is struggling in school, he barely see's his friends, and he worries about his Aunt May. His girlfriend Mary Jane is an actress and Harry is head of Oscorp, making it the company his father Norman always wanted it to be. Osborne has just signed Dr. Otto Octavious to show a new experiment reveling the power of the sun in a persons hand. On the big show day, the experiment goes wrong and it kills Miss. Octavious and welds mechanical arms to the back of Otto Octavious. Now as a monster Octavious sets out to a life of crime so he can rebuild his machine and start the experiment all over again, this time that can destroy all of New York! It's up to Peter to stop Dr. Octopuss. But Peter soon realizes he is turning normal and his powers are vanishing. Can he stop the evil villain before all the people he know and loves are all doomed!? First off, great cast! I loved the characters from the beat Peter Parker all the way to the mean and one liner Daily Buelgel boss J. Jonah Jamenson. The plot is fantastic and the villain is 100 times better then Norman Osbornes Green Goblin. The special affects are better than the original and are much cleaner. I'm glad to see that Toby returned to play Spider-Man, without him the film would be dead. Also the funny line about his bad back after he falls off a building would be gone, ha!Thank you Sam for directing this wonderful film. This is what blockbusters are supposed to be like!",9,1,2,23 June 2005
Batman Returns," Can't believe I'm saying it, but Batman & Robin is better then this
","Batman Returns is the bottom of the barrel. I can not stand this sequel at all, Batman and Robin was better then this crap! The sequel brings in two tone villains from the cartoon that nobody even liked including The Penguin and Catwoman. Danny Devito was the best choice for the Penguin but I never liked the villain. He just seemed like some old guy in the sewers with a birth defect who likes to play with birds and collect umbrellas. Catwoman was a bad choice for second villain. She made no sense to be here, I hated her character as well. Plus ever sense the Halie Berrie version of Catwoman came out, you can't take Batman Returns Catwoman seriously. Christopher Walken as Max was alright, not a bad guy from the cartoons but he was a good mad up bad guy who ran on his own rules. Keaton returns ounce again as Batman and his performance has dropped low ever sense the first Batman. Sure this film is dark and has an edge but it falls like a rock. Batman and Robin at least was perfect for a six year old to enjoy while this film would make kids run and cry. The villains are lame, the plot with Penguin is stupid, and the directing is all down the toilet. Batman Returns gets the big 2, low sequel that has no entertainment. Not recommended, especially to fans of the original.",2,7,20,1 July 2005
Rocky II," My personal favorite Rocky film
","Sly makes a comeback as Rocky Balboa in the hit sequel to the classic boxing film Rocky. It is really powerful in love and it shows how much anger can push a guy over the edge. I felt a moment of joy when Adrian told Rocky to do one thing, win! Micky's line made me laugh afterward. This is the best Rocky film out of the whole bunch. Apollo is back wanting a rematch and Rocky is starting to get a better life while spending all his match money. Sly directed this film with spunk and it made a great formula for Rocky, the best! If you loved the original, you'll love this one! The best in the series, the king of the saga. Go out and get Rocky II, a big 9. You'll love it, enjoy!",9,1,1,28 June 2005
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Hit and miss deal
","Star Wars: Attack of the Clones gets the big 6 for me. While this movie was not good enough to be put up on the throne of excellence with the original Star Wars, I put this as a good popcorn flick. We have a good story but this film results in hits and misses. Big hits include Jengo Fett, Boba was my favorite character from the original trilogy and Jengo was a nice return to the Fett character, the battle with Mace Windu in the Colosseum, the battle with Yoda and Dooku... for a little guy that jedi could move, and the speed racer race between Anakin and Obi to find the evil female assassin through the city. Now here are the misses. I hated the love sequences between Padme and Anakin I nearly fell asleep, not enough Jengo Fett, not enough Mace Windu and his cool lightsabre, and it seems George Lucas wants to bore us to tears to enjoy this film. Sure he made a better movie than Phantom Menace but that's not saying much.I don't get why we don't see Dooku till the end. I liked the performance made by Christopher Lee as Dooku, only wishing there was more of him. With Star Wars- Attack of The Clones, you have to tell yourself that this is of the new trilogy. Chances are you would want to stick to the originals for real entertainment and watch this when you want to kill time.",6,0,1,23 June 2005
Alien vs. Predator," Predators first nail in it's coffin and Aliens final nail in it's coffin
","Alien Vs. Predator is not a bad film. But on the other hand it is not a good film either. The director Paul W.S. Anderson has not only violated one monster series, he's violated two! Alien has had it's shares of bad sequels with Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection and Predator hasn't had a bad film yet though Part 2 was a notch down from Part 1. Anderson has worked up the series for them to collide and fight and this film brings the action, sort of. The whole idea of a land under the ice somewhere was a good idea, the ice being so thick that the land is under under ground about a few hundred miles. Then the whole idea of having a crew of 100 more people go find the land, bad! Anderson kills off eighty percent of the cast in the first half hour! The predators kills a whole platoon and alien eggs hatch, catching another platoon which is pretty stupid because in the original Alien it's quite a while for the alien to pop out of Kanes chest. But when our platoon wakes up the alien burst right out for welcome, stupid! And that brings the whole idea later for an alien hatching itself into the predator, what a joke! We have origins of the predators which ruin the characters and the question of how the Queen Alien was chained up for a long decade. Then here comes the Predator and Alien fighting, bad action sequence. Not one bit of good fighting techniques. Aliens head is slashed off, Predators die from Alien acid blood and blah. And Anderson, you were stupid to have the Predator work alongside a human. Anderson you are sure one heck of an idiot. The cast is bad, horrible acting. Boy, Anderson you have killed. Now Aliens have crossed over because of this head to head sequel but Predator is still alive. AVP gets the big 6, not good but not bad either. It's worth at least a rental, though some fans might be disappointed.",6,0,2,30 June 2005
Batman Begins," The way Batman is supposed to be
","Forget Batman and Robin which nearly ruined the Batman franchise. Batman Begins is hard edge, gritty, and dark. Christian Bale is the best Batman actor and Michael Cane is the best Alfred, giving the butler more character to be Bruce's guardian. Liam Neeson is great as Ducard, putting away his role in the mediocre film Star Wars: The Phantom Menace. My props though go to Cillian Murphy who plays the creepy and twisted Dr. Crane a.k.a the Scarecrow. Boy can that guy act, he is far by the best Batman villain in the entire franchise! Katie Holmes is satisfying as Bruce's love girl and Gary Oldman was the perfect Jim Gordon, looking exactly like the character and playing him with good comedic relief. A new character added to the series is Mr. Morgan Freeman playing a duplicate double of James Bonds Q, Lucius Fox. Now thanks to the character of Mr. Fox, we finally found out where Bruce got his supplies, and may I say that Batmobile was wicked!We now have a real Batman movie that all fans will love. And the end of this film gives a great nod to the first Batman film, you'll find out when you see it. Bruce Wayne has never seemed more interesting, thank you Mr. Nolan for giving us a Batman film we can all enjoy! You need to go out and see this movie, it's one of the greatest movies of 2005!",10,0,0,26 June 2005
1941," The last hour was hilarious!
","I watched 1941 the other day to see if Steven Spielberg really can direct a bad movie and yes he can. Steven has directed a piece of boring garbage which starts with a spoof of his film Jaws with the evil Japanese trying to find Hollywood so they can bomb it. From that mildly amusing opening, the film falls short. But at least the final hour of the film was funny! We have crazy John Belushi chasing after after an enemy ship on a motorcycle needing to tell them 'Nobody move! Your taking me to Tokyo, anyone got a light?' You have two idiots on a ferris wheel with snipers shooting at the ship while not having them shoot at their wheel. You have a family man who uses a soldiers torpedo gun that has been placed on his front lawn for supervision and every time he aims for the ship and shoots, the machine hurls him through his own house crashing through the walls, you have a General crying over Dumbo, the entire army are fallowing Belushi with their leader Dan Akroyd knocked crazy as he thinks he is a fly, you have a black soldier running after his tank covered in flour, you have two lovers in an enemy jet shooting at their own people while making out and so on. I give this film the big 4 even though it deserves a two but the last hour pumped the score up a little. But that does not save 1941, skip the film unless you rewind the film to it's last hour.",4,0,1,26 June 2005
Mission: Impossible II," From De Palma to Woo
","Every director has his own sense of style. Brian De Palma is a Hitchcock stylist while John Woo is pure action. With the first Mission Impossible, De Palma made it slick and intelligent with a very in dept story line and crafty action. Woo on the other hand makes Mission Impossible 2 a low key love story filled with explosions and boring dialog. Woo diverts all our attention away from the previous M:I's feel into a whole new setting with a whole new tone. With Woo's non-stop rush of adrenaline, he turns Ethan Hunt from a cool super spy into a hardcore daredevil.Tom Cruise makes his return as Ethan Hunt, a spy who is on holiday climbing cliffs who happens to be called in on a very impossible mission. Seems as though a rogue IMF agent, played by Dougray Scott, has crashed a plane and kidnapped a top secret disease only known by it's name, Chemira. Hunt is assigned to enlist a jewel thief to help find out the agents plan. Along with Ethan comes his super hacker pal Luther Stickell, played ounce again by the brute of a man Ving Rhames. Together, Ethan must save the world and the girl who he has fallen in love with. Wait, a love story in a Mission Impossible movie? That's what Woo is giving us? John Woo is a good director, I'll give him that, but he should have left this movie alone. Brian De Palma had already set up a clever spy franchise and Woo took it down within the first ten minutes when we see Tom Cruise scaling a cliff like he's Spider-Man. Ethan is totally different here than in the previous movie, looking like a regular Steven Segal poser. The acting is worse than part 1, total boredom. Woo, instead of entertaining us, bores us to tears. And the villain is horrible. The plot is a deflated idea used over fifty times and yet Woo decides to pump it up with air again and use it. The special effects, alright. We get some good CGi here and there, and an excellent shot of an knife about to stab Tom's eyeball out, but sense it's six years later after this movie was released, it's old.The only real saving grace is the action. Woo throws in as many bullets and explosions as he can. We have a cool motorcycle chase, a glass room shattered to pieces with bullets, exploding sun glasses, and even a two man wrestling match atop a hill. Sadly, the action itself is either to slow or too fast and it looses it's willpower. The movie acts like a Dawsons Creek episode, a love triangle while death is involved. Sorry Mr. Woo but this movie was pretty bad. My advice to all the viewers out in the world, see Part 3. JJ Abrams made the best one, cooler then De Palma's and makes Woo's looks like trash. Mission Impossible 2 gets a 6 out of 10. C- on my grade.",6,0,0,14 June 2006
Mission: Impossible," Don't worry about the plot, just go with the flow
","Enter the mind of Ethan Hunt, a slick and clever spy working for the IMF. He's the James Bond of the new century, getting cool gadgets and working with a crack staff of team members. Mission Impossible, based upon the hit TV series, gives us a new look at spy's. Unlike Bong who gets all the girls and kills the bad guy in a matter of minutes, Hunt gets no women and can't even pin the villain in a matter of three days. Brian De Palma gives the spies in Mission Impossible a more human shell, which whom they really are and not some Super-Man hit-man. Mission Impossible, though unfaithful to the series it's derived from, sets itself up as a intelligent spy franchise. The only problem a person can have with this movie is it's confusing plot. But the only way we can get past the plot is just go with the films flow, and we do.Tom Cruise plays Ethan Hunt, the point man spy in a group of agents under the control of their leader Jim Phelps, played by John Voight. They are assigned to crash a party and photograph a man who is said to have a computer disk containing every name of every IMF agent in the embassy and their aliases. Hunt and his team go to the party undercover and retrieve the photographs only to have each member of the team picked off one by one. Even Phelps gets knocked off and Ethan is the only one left alive. Ethan is then told the mission was a fake to flush out a mole who's been paying an arms dealer and they suspect Ethan of being that mole. It's now up to Ethan to find the real mole and save his name with the help of a few suspended operatives, including Ving Rhames. Now this plot may sound simple, but that's because your reading it. I had to watch the movie twice to fully understand the plot.Mission Impossible may have this overly thought out plot but you forget all about it. Tom looks cool, the gadgets are cool, and the action is neatly done to give us a nice ride through a spy mission without even remembering what the plot was about. Tom's acting is perfectly done to give Ethan the on the run spy. Ving is awesome as Ethan's partner and Mrs. Beart as Claire Phelps is a nice touch. The special effects are nice. A little hokey looking though, especially the final chase scene on a train being fallowed by a helicopter. And the bad guy, even though there feels like there's three of them, is a clever plot twist that leaves us satisfied. Plus the gadgets are awesome. Exploding chewing gum, fluid spewing pens, exploding video cassettes, it's all here and not over used like any Bond weapon.The only real beef with this movie is that there wasn't enough action. De Palma acts out by directing this movie with more brain then brawn. We have too much plot but little action. The real movie's blunder doesn't even pick up till half way in when we have the memorable shot of Ethan dangling about an inch over a pressure padded floor trying to retrieve the disk of aliases. With the name Mission Impossible, we expect plenty of action sequences but instead we have a warmed over plot going three different ways. Even the ending battle isn't that memorable and it leaves us with a feeling of, not awe, but shallowness. But that doesn't mean De Palma didn't do a good job. He does a great job giving his Hitchcock touch to the movie, giving us smart characters and a real atmosphere. Mission Impossible gets a 7 out 10 from me. It was cool, but does't get our attention right away. And if you had to choose one M:I movie to see, go see part 3. Part 3 was best, easily beating out this brain scratching film and John Woo's weepy sequel. Mission impossible= B.",7,0,1,15 June 2006
Rocky III," Balboa's beaten Creed but can he beat Clubber Lang?
","After the events of Rocky I and II, Rocky is now filthy rich by winning his matches. But soon from the ashes comes a big mouth rough boxer named Clubber Land (Mr. T) and after he defeats his fights, he orders Rocky to give him a fight for the belt. Rocky agree's but at the fight, not only does he loose the match and his belt but he witnesses the death of his manager Mickey. Now with the help of Apollo Creed, Rocky challenges Lang for a rematch for the belt, can he win it all again? Sly returns in this second sequel to the smash boxing hit Rocky. This film is not as good as the first two but it proves to be a really entertaining film with the lust of winning and gaining back the eye of the tiger. Mr. T gives a great performance as the killing machine Clubber Lang. Sadly, Burgess Meredith must act as his character Micky passes away in this chapter. But this is a good subplot for when Apollo Creed steps up and helps Rocky train for his fight with Clubber, making the two good friends. This film though, it's worn down from the past two with Rocky now a big star. Though not perfect, this film gives great performances. One may I say is the big brawl between Rocky and Hulk Hogans Thunderlips for charity and it's great! So if you like the first two movies, you'll appreciate Rocky III. Rocky III gets the big 7, it may be worn down it's still pretty entertaining. Enjoy!",7,0,0,27 June 2005
War of the Worlds," Spielberg does it again
","The remake of War of The Worlds has to be one of the best Sci Fi films this year. Superb special effects, great acting, and a cool story makes this film a total hit! Tom Cruise is perfect as Ray, a down on luck father whose children don't respect him. Dakota Fanning is right on with the part of Rachel, Rays son. Plus we have the son Robbi played dead on by Chatwright. Now the story is cheesy with the whole idea of alien tripods being under the ground and the aliens are transported by lightning through the ground into the tripods so it rises to Earth level and starts havoc, but it all works! The directing is perfectly done by one of the coolest directors of all time, thank you Steven. The special affects though are the best part! Ray driving away from the house with the whole neighborhood being blasted was fantastic, the aliens zapping the people to dust was breath taking, the ferry ride was cool, the electronic eye, the blood weeds, the burning train, you name it was awesome! But then we have Tim Robbins playing some brute survivalist called Harlan. He has one of the best line 'This isn't a war, it's an extermination.' But you feel as though the character is really unneeded. He gets killed off and you feel like we just wasted a huge chunk of the movie with nothing but some guy who is all dirty and always clutches a shotgun. Tom Cruise though also has the same act as the dad always having his daughter clutched around him, and you feel like it's been the same shot reused. But the film overall is an A, a perfect Sci Fi film. War of The Worlds gets the big 9, some things slowed it down like Tim but the film makes a big mark on you. Enjoy!",9,1,4,8 July 2005
The Waterboy," Some may consider this Adam Sandlers best, but I don't
","Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, Bid Daddy. These are just a few of my favorite Adams Sandler films, and his best may I add. But some people consider The Waterboy Sandlers best film ever. Well I'm sorry but I beg to differ. Sandler plays Bobby Boucher Jr. who is considered an idiot because of his annoying accent and slow mind. His devil hating mama pampers him too much and he just got fired from his job as water boy distributer from a big college football team. Bobby then becomes the new water boy for the worst college football team ever The Mud Dogs, being coached by mentally broken down Coach Klien played by Henry Winkler. Bobby gets insulted by his new team mates only for the coach to tell him to stand up for himself. Bobby then pictures the people who has made fun of him in his life on his targets shoulders and tackles them to the ground! Thanks to Bobby's anger tackles, he becomes a tackler for the Mud Dogs and leads them to the Burbon Bowl. Problem is along the way, his momma goes into the hospital with a 'broken' heart, Bobby's jail bird girlfriend disrespects him, and his old football team are the ones who will be facing him at the Bowl. What will Bobby do?I'm not saying this is a bad movie but it is totally off from a great movie. One main problem with the movie is Sandler himself. He does a great job as Bobby except his characters accent (which is more of a stutter, whine, scream, and mentally retarded yelp rolled into one) makes your eardrums cringe every time he speaks. It gets so annoying after half the film that you just can't wait for the movie to pick up the pace and be over with. But if you really get past the voice and look beyond the dumb atmosphere, you fall right into the movie and really enjoy it.Now Sandler isn't the only character that makes the film 'dumb.' Every character in this movie is like a rejected Bugs Bunny cartoon character refused to be shown on cable broadcast. First there's Bobby with his nails on a chalk board voice, Coach Klien who likes acting retarded every time he has a bad play thrown, evil Coach Red who is just a stupid jerk, Farmer Fran the assistant coach who is nothing but a dumb Amish farmer who can't even speak right, Mama Boucher who's devil hating persona falls to the ground only after three minutes of depth, Rob Schnider as his classic Townie character who shout's nothing but 'You can do it!', and of coarse we have Vickie Valencourt, Bobby's love interest, but she isn't really needed in the movie. Sure she's a nice piece of cast decoration but her character is so annoying. She's a criminal, psychic, and murderer wrapped into one body and the only time she does anything good is to help Bobby at the big football bowl game in some stupid plot turn that only last a mere thirty seconds.The jokes are real cornball but in a good way. With all the football moments and hard tackling, the jokes are pretty low tack. The special effects are just plane bad looking when Bobby pictures his anger on people's shoulders and the coach pictures babies and pooches. Also the whole football team are nothing but big babies wearing jerseys. One is a dumb playboy, another is a dim witted Frankenstein, another seems like a gay punter who likes to picture KKK members heads on his football before he kicks em', it just gets so stupid after a while. You even get tired of watching this movie all the way up to the big bowl game at the end of the film after seeing all the really bad jokes and seeing Bobby tackle so many people for some stupid reason. Like in one scene, he tackles his professor for saying his mama was wrong about what makes an alligator so meanWhat the Waterboy is though is a good time slot filler. If you just want a slow paced dumb comedy, sure you will get a kick out of it. Like I said, it's not a bad movie but it's too stupid and corny just to take seriously. I enjoyed it a little so maybe you could too. I give the Waterboy a 6. If you want Classic Sandler, get Happy Gilmore or Billy Madison. If you want Sandler's second to rate cornball comedies, get this. I still say Happy Gilmore was his best. The Waterboy= C+",6,0,3,3 December 2005
Scream," 'Do you like scary movies?' Yes I do!
","Scream is a perfect ten, my all time favorite scary movie. Wes Craven knows how to do horror films and he's brought us an all out horror mystery classic about a hooded figure that's killing teenage kids in a small town. The plot is like any other scary movie, kids are killed, killer gets caught leading to him being unmasked and big shock, yeah well there's a twist! The writer has put in a twist that the kids know that they are in a scary movie, needing to fallow the rules. The cast is perfect, my props go to Matthew Lillard as Stu, the best character in the whole movie. The opening is played perfect and Drew couldn't of been more on the mark. Jamie Kennedy is the perfect as his role as the geeky film nerd Randy who lives by horror films. David Arquet, Courtney Cox,Henry Winkler, and more support this film which gives it the extra steam to be a perfect film. The acting is done greatly, mostly by Drew in the beginning because you can feel for her as she is being spied on by our killer Mr. Ghostface. And I must say, though we don't see his face, we must thank the man who did the phone voice Mr. Roger Jackson. Well done Wes, great directing. Now not only do you have a great plot and well in depth characters, you get tons of blood. For gore fans, you'll really appreciate this film. Now do all yourselves a favor if your a scary movie nut like me, quickly go out and get a copy of Scream. Itself is a scream, enjoy!",10,0,0,25 June 2005
Fantastic Four," Not all that fantastic but it is still cool
","The Fantastic Four is about five people going into space to study a deadly cloud of radioactivity to discover the origin of human genes. The mission goes awry when the cloud hit the space craft and changed the people inside it. Dr. Richards became the stretchable Mr. Fantastic, Susan Storm became the Invisible Woman, Susans brother Johny became the wild Human Torch, and Ben Grimm became the powerful Thing equaling the Fantastic Four. Sadly the fifth person has became an evil mastermind, his body molding into medal for him to control electricity under the persona of the evil Dr. Doom. Can the Fantastic Four defeat Dr. Doom? Now Fantastic Four isn't a perfect film and it's not the best Marvel Comic Book movie. But it's better than the a few other failures like Hulk or Daredevil. Fantastic Four is cool with good acting, a great storyline, and really impressive graphics. First off The Thing was great! He looked amazing and the actor was born to play the role. The acting is all played wonderfully by actors like Jessica Alba and Julian McMahon, and if you can try to point out Stan Lee's cameo as the mailman. Each one of the characters has their own thought of their powers and how to control them. Richards wants to be normal and he tries to make a cure, Susan wants to be normal while running around and taking off her clothes to get away from the press, Johny though goes along with his powers to become famous, and Ben hates his power because he lost his girlfriend. The special affects are nice though sometimes you can tell when it's fake and cheesy. Though not full out fantastic, Fantastic Four succeeds in being a cool super hero comic film with lots of action, a little comedy, and some drama. Fantastic Four gets the big 7, flawed in many ways but still a great film. Recommnded for everyone. Enjoy!",7,0,0,15 July 2005
