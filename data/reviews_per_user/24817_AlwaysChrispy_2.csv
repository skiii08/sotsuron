Iron Man 3," Wow Soo BAD
","I waited a day after I saw this movie to write this review because I didn't want to write it on a per emotional bases.Spoiler Alert: I did not think a Marvel or a Iron Man movie could be this bad. I was skeptical when I saw the trailers but I had faith in Paramount and Marvel that after the success of the Avengers they would do nothing to screw this up. Boy was I wrong. If you are a movie fan, like me, you may check IMDb.com and moviefone.com to see what kind of ratings and reviews movies are getting from critics and users. I don't always believe cities or other users but this time I wish I would have looked a little harder. Whoever voted this movie as a 7.7 on IMDb or gave it 3 & 1/2 out of 4 stars on Moviefone should never be aloud to vote again. This movie should not have even been in theaters but instead been put on the Disney channel, and even by that comparison I still would have said it was terrible. I was so disappointed with Iron Man 2 that I thought there is no way they would screw up again, but I was wrong, this was WAY worst. On a scale of how bad I would even compare this to the Green Lantern Movie and say Green Lantern may have been better.About the movie: They tried to make a darker more gritty version of Iron Man, I think, but it turned out to be just stupid. How this scrip made it to the big screen is beyond me. The villains were all bad, the jokes were awful, the acting was no good and even the computer graphic were just OK. The end with Pepper was just something I had to laugh at because of how dumb it was. I am trying not to go to into to much detail but trust me there was NO part of this movie I thought was good! Let me restate this so you don't get the wrong idea, I am a movie Fan and I am a super hero, Marvel, DC Fan. This is truly my first review I have written but I felt this had to be shared.Please save your money, Do Not Go See This Movie. If it was possible I would sue Paramount for not my money back, but my 130 minutes of my life I lost!",1,4,10,14 May 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," If you liked the first film you will like this one!
","May Contain Spoilers but not many: Don't see Iron Man 3, see this instead.I was never a fan of Star Trek before the first J.J. Abrams movie but now I consider myself a fan. I thought this movie was well done and very entertaining. However, I can see why Trekkie's may not have liked it. There truly wasn't that many aliens or interactions with Klingon's or alien races. It was more about internal problem with star fleet than anything else. But from an entertainment stand point I would say it fully succeeded expectations.I am sorry for the Trekkie fans that J.J. took a historic franchise and turned it Hollywood and 'dumbed' it down for the general population but I believe that is the only way it could have been successful because the general population didn't fully support the franchise before his first film.I saw this in IMAX 3D and it was well worth the $15 to see it. Besides a couple thin plot points they threw in there, it was very well done and I truly enjoyed it. This is the first movie in a long time I would recommend to anyone that is a fan of Sci Fi. If you liked the first film you will like this one, I promise you that much.",9,3,6,20 May 2013
