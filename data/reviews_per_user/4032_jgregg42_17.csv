Sucker Punch," 'Sucker Punch' tries to hit you with its best shot.
","Baby Doll, Sweet Pea, Amber, Blondie and Rocket all must band together to fight zombies, giant samurais, dragons and robots to find five objects in order to escape the mental institute. That must have been as much information Zack Snyder (director of '300' and 'Watchmen') was able to fit on his cocktail napkin as he drafted the screen play for 'Sucker Punch.' Snyder's original concept could be either an expansive epic tale with lots of eye candy for the fan boys or the plot to a late night Cinemax adult film. Take out the action scenes then add in a few 'adult situations' and the story is basically the same.We start our journey with the main focus of the five heroines, Baby Doll (played by Emily Browning). She narrates the opening scene telling us that we all have guardian angels watching over us. She then offers some psychobabble about how sometimes the bad things can also lead to good things.In an opening sequence with very little dialogue, we see her mother die then there is a terrible accident that forces her evil stepfather to commit Baby Doll to an insane asylum. Once in the Asylum Baby Doll has five days before she is given a frontal lobe lobotomy.From this point forward, the viewer should really shut his or her mind off and enjoy the ride. Nothing more is explained on how things work or even why they work in Snyder's world. This is a pure gratification film from the aesthetic viewpoint.Baby Doll immediately learns how to use a cerebral performance to escape the asylum even if it is only in her mind. But where would a 20-year-old orphan escape to if she had the choice? Of course, she would choose to escape to a burlesque house. Yep, that's right, a place worse than the asylum. Now she has to run away from a sleazy pimp (played by Oscar Isaac) and his filthy clientele. Also, in this alternate world, she will also choose to wear scanty lingerie (hey, I'm on board with it).Baby Doll soon finds that she can be a persuasive exotic dancer. While dancing she holds her viewers captive so that she can visit alternative realities. In her first trip she meets up with a wise sage (played by Scott Glenn) who gives her instructions on how to escape from her asylum/ burlesque house. He gives her a samurai sword and a fully loaded hand gun. Similar to the plot of many Xbox video games, she is given a task to do and each level becomes progressively harder. Luckily she bands together with four other girls who don't like wearing a lot of clothes either.The plan is simple: Baby Doll dances to distract her captors while the four girls gather their needed objects to escape. Her dancing is so hypnotic that we, the audience, aren't even allowed to see her dance. Instead we see several extremely articulate action scenes all held together by a soundtrack with cover songs from The Beatles, The Pixies and Jefferson Airplane. It's a fair trade.Should you see this movie? Only if you like action, fantasy, and young girls dressed in various seductive costumes (you know who you are).The bulk of the film is an action fantasy that would make perfect sense to die-hard gamers, steam punkers, sci-fi geeks, and almost any dude under the age of 25. Right before the credits roll, we hear the message of why we were watching this orgy of guns, swords and cleavage for the last hour and a half. With that, Snyder mucks up a perfectly good visually amplified film by trying to add a deep meaning to it. I did feel sucker punched because of that effort.",6,2,9,25 March 2011
Source Code," 'Source Code' — see it again for the first time
","I can hear it now, the reviews from a not too distant future about Duncan Jones' (director of 'Moon') latest film 'Source Code.' It will sound something like 'It's 'Quantum Leap' and 'Groundhog Day' combined.' That will be coming from both movie reviewers and the general moving going public. They will be right. For the most part. 'Source Code' follows the same premise as the 1990s TV show 'Quantum Leap' (in fact, keep your ears open for a cameo by a famous leaper) where the hero jumps into another's person's body via quantum physics. The theory of quantum physics is explained to the viewer in simple terms so that no one is confused. A military agency found a method to transport a test subject into the body of someone eight minutes before they die. The story allows a brief narrative on how it works; if it went any further it would have lost most of the audience. The test subject is Capt. Colter Stevens (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) a helicopter pilot in the U.S. Army who was recently on his third tour of duty in Afghanistan. Jones does a brilliant job of setting the audience up in the first scenes. We are there with Colter when he awakes in a commuter train bound for Chicago. He does not realize immediately that he is in a schoolteacher's body. He has the same reaction that most of us would in a new situation, immediately trying to figure what is happening. After eight minutes the train explodes and the Captain leaps back to his reality in a capsule at an undisclosed location. He is then presented a series of assimilation tests by Colleen Goodwin (played by Vera Farmiga) via a computer screen and video camera. She is with an unknown military agency but we, and Colter, are not sure which one. The task for Colter is simple; he must keep leaping back into the schoolteacher's body on the train until he finds the bomber. During these leaps back to the train he is developing a relationship with a friend of the schoolteacher, Christina (played by Michelle Monaghan). His missions continue to be eight minutes long and when he continues to fail he continues to blow up along with the train. The process then has to start all over. With each mission Colter is discovering more and more about the train, the bomb and all of its passengers. Is this starting to sound like 'Groundhog Day?' It is similar in some respects but don't expect any cameos by a famous furry subterranean rodent or any catchy Sonny and Cher songs. The story continually pulls the viewer in not only because we want to know how Colter saves the day but also why Colter is in this situation in the first place. The story quickly becomes a 'who done it' film with great ease because we care about the characters and their outcomes. Should you see this movie? Yes. This film had a story that kept you engaged. It also presented a real fear of terrorism that most Americans could connect with. Gyllenhaal is proving himself as a strong leading man. He can be tough, sensitive and comedic while performing the same scenes over and over again. The entire cast including the strangers on the train seemed to gel together and lead the audience further the down rabbit hole without losing us. Plus, in the end we hear a nice message about why it is still good to be a human in a world that is so bitter and filled with fear.",8,2,5,1 April 2011
127 Hours," It's Not About The Arm
","You have probably heard the story about the man that went canyoneering, alone, in Utah in 2003, not telling anyone where he was going. Five days later he emerged out of the Utah canyons, missing an arm. He had become wedged between a rock and a hard place (literally) and eventually had to cut his own arm off in order to survive. If you were like me you probably thought to yourself, 'Wow, what an awful experience, I bet that sucks. Oh well, back to my life.' The truth is that the self amputation handiwork is not even close to what the man, Aron Ralston, had to go through for the first 124 hours of his ordeal. Having read 'It's Not About the Bike' by Lance Armstrong, I think it is fair to compare the two stories not only about survivorship but also about the bigger picture in which we call 'life.' You have probably also heard how Armstrong survived testicular cancer to go on to win the Tour De France seven times. Again you might have thought to yourself 'Wow, he had a small bout with cancer and now everything is all right. Oh well, back to my life.' The severe gravity of these situations don't settle in until you hear or see the personal stories of what these individuals endured to earn their lives back. Danny Boyle, is the director who helped bring Ralston's excruciating story to the screen in '127 Hours.' Boyle, with an eclectic resume including a movie about heroin addiction ('Trainspotting'), a movie about two youngsters finding a bag of money ('Millions'), and a Bollywood movie ('Slumdog Millionaire'), focused on the events that put the viewer in Ralston's position then made that viewer understand that there was only two ways out of the cavern.We start the story with Ralston (played by James Franco) driving out to the Utah canyons while inconveniently forgetting his Swiss Army knife at home (he would need that later). He runs into two young female hikers and introduces them to an underground swimming hole. Not knowing these are the last two people he will have contact with for quite some time.After parting ways with the hikers, Ralston tumbles down a narrow canyon and his right arm becomes wedged between a small boulder and the canyon wall. He has the exact same reaction that I would have, 'AGGHHHH!!!' I understood his anger because I too would react in the same way. I too would not accept my situation. I too would be cursing at the rock.Before this movie, I did wonder how Boyle was going to keep us engaged for the length of the film. It's a hard task considering Ralston was in one place for five days. Boyle, along with Franco's brilliant acting, was able to keep us flowing from day to day. Sure there are the flash back scenes and a few Scooby-Doo induced hallucinations. But, the one thing that kept my attention was what Ralston actually did while trapped in the crevice. He had a video camera and he videotaped himself giving an ultimate gratitude list to his parents and friends. Even in his dying hours, he wanted his parents to know how he felt about them. He even went as far as producing a humorous morning talk show with himself. It was real, and it worked. That video is now in a safety deposit box where only a few sets of eyes have seen it.Should you see this movie? Yes, but don't see it because a guy cuts off his arm to survive. See it because you want a story about why a guy cuts off his own arm to survive. See it because you need to know the answer to what you would do if you were in Ralston's predicament. See it because you are the type of person (to quote an earlier Boyle movie) to 'choose life' and you know deep down inside that there is a force driving you.",8,60,94,24 November 2010
Just Go with It," 'Just Go with It'...or not.
","I wish that I could live in movies. Everything would be so much easier. Sure I would have problems, but they would all be solved in two hours our less. I would find a beautiful woman and of course there would be some discourse then I would try to deceive her through a series of lies. She would catch me in these lies and we would either a) make up and get back together or b) I find my true love, who was my 'Plain Jane' friend all along. Regardless we would live happily ever after... until the sequel where we have kids and something zany would bound to happen. 'Just Go with It' is the newest comedy starring Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston. Sandler plays Danny, an immature, unprofessional plastic surgeon in Beverly Hills. He had his heart broken years ago right before his wedding. He called the wedding off; now single, he wears his wedding band to the bars. Here he finds attractive women and convinces them that he is in an awful marriage. The random women feel sorry for him then automatically sleep with him (note to self: buy a wedding band today). He does this for 23 years; think about it - 23 years of one-night stands. Danny finally meets the girl of his dreams, Palmer (played by Brooklyn Decker), at a party. She is a perfect '10' and she sleeps with him without even seeing his phony wedding band (note to self: go to more parties). When they awake, she finds his wedding band and thinks he is married. Palmer is 23 years old. This means when Danny started sleeping with random women, Palmer was in diapers. Does any one else find that creepy? Since Danny has deep feelings for this particular one-night stand, he starts lying to her in order to keep her. His office assistant, Katherine (Played by Aniston) helps him in the lie by pretending to be Danny's soon-to-be ex-wife. Palmer wants to meet Danny's future ex-wife because of some issues she had with her own parents' divorce. They all meet at a restaurant where they don't talk about the divorce; it's frankly five minutes of Danny and Katherine insulting each other about their phony marriage that is about to end in a phony divorce. The interaction between the three is almost done when Katherine receives a call from her kids and now Palmer wants to meet Danny's phony kids. Now we have to drag two kids into this web of lies. This storyline added some much needed fresh talent. The young actress, Bailee Madison who plays the daughter, did a wonderful job of pulling the spotlight onto herself since Aniston and Sandler weren't doing much to move out of their own comfort zone. One lie leads to the next and they all end up in Hawaii. While on an impromptu family vacation with Danny, his girlfriend, his phony soon-to-be ex-wife, her phony soon-to-be husband (played by Nick Swardson) and the phony kids, the headache is getting bigger and the jokes are falling flatter. Through rampant coincidence the phony couple meets Katherine's old sorority sister and her husband (played by Nicole Kidman and Dave Matthews). Now we are presented a whole new lie and not a lot of fresh jokes to make it worth our time.The entire story snowballs up to the part that the audience saw coming from about 15 minutes into the film. Danny soon finds who he should really be with; it shouldn't be much of a surprise if you have been following along. Should you see this movie? No, it's just another Sandler film. If you are a die-hard Sandler fan you will probably see it regardless. He likes to find one joke and hold onto it through the film. Let it go, man; just because you talk in a funny voice doesn't mean you should do it all the time.",4,14,35,11 February 2011
Megamind," Mega Mediocrity
","Well, Pixar, your jobs are safe ... for now. I am sure that you are well aware that the folks at DreamWorks are rapping on your door. Sure you might have superior graphics and excellent screen writing skills, but in time, others will try for your stature in the industry. After more and more studios jump on the computer animation bandwagon, you will soon be lost in the onslaught. That's still a ways off in the future, though. 'Megamind' is the newest minion in DreamWorks' army of family animation films ('Shrek', 'Madagascar,' 'How to Train Your Dragon'). With an A-List cast, it delivers humor and enough action to keep the audience entertained for the most part. Not a lot of inside jokes for Mom and Dad but the soundtrack (familiar songs by AC/DC and Guns 'n Roses) will provide a nostalgic trip for them while the kiddies are watching a couple of superheroes destroy a city.The film has the essential plot elements of the antagonist and soon-to-be protagonist Megamind (voiced by Will Ferrell) and his desire to become an evil super genius. In Ferrell's best Vincent Price voice, he narrates to the audience on how he became such an evil mastermind. He also explains his modus operandi on why he wants to be the bane of Metro City (as a running gag he mispronounces the name of the city). We find that he spent his childhood in a prison (one of the world's only fun prisons by the way) and having to compete with Metro Man (voiced by Brad Pitt) in school (another word Megamind can't pronounce). We follow Megamind's growth into adulthood where he chooses the path of evil while Metro Man chooses the path of good. When Metro Man is accepting an award for being, well, Metro Man, Megamind kidnaps a local news reporter, Roxanne Ritchi (voiced by Tina Fey). A few things go wrong and unknowingly Megamind kills Metro Man. This was not part of the plan. As most of you know if you kill off your nemesis there will be no more adventures. There will be no more extravagant duels. More importantly there will be no more money to be made off of the franchise. When Metro Man 'dies' and we are left with Megamind and his Minion (voiced by David Cross) to rule Metro City. Megamind quickly decides that it would be best to invent a new enemy so can cure his overwhelming depression. He needs a yin to his yang, someone to fill the void that Metro Man left. He unintentionally injects super serum into Roxanne's camera man's nose (voiced by Jonah Hill). Megamind trains his new protégé, Tighten (which is a misspelled moniker of Titan), to become a superhero so they can have an enormous duel and then Megamind can become the super villain that he once was. While exacting his evil plan, Megamind is falling in love with Roxanne while he is posing as a nerdy museum curator. And while doing that he ... you know what? It is already too confusing. For a kid's movie, the story is about as clear as mud. The exciting final fight scene (which imitates the ending fight scene of Pixar's 'The Incredibles') is what the kids will remember the most. You will see some exceptional 3D fight scenes through out the film. If you liked the animation DreamWorks did with 'How to Train Your Dragon' then you won't be disappointed here. Should you see this movie? Are you a kid ages 4-12? Sure, then go see it. Don't try to follow the story too closely, leave that up to Mom and Dad to try to decipher. Eat your popcorn, drink your soda, laugh at some of the crude jokes, try to relate to Megamind when he was a kid and ride it out to the end. Then wait for Pixar to come out with a story that we can all follow.",6,0,17,5 November 2010
Captain America: The First Avenger," Captain America is a Three Star General
","Does America need another hero? Not a dark brooding hero like Batman. Nor a cocky scientist like Iron Man. Certainly not a weenie teenager like Spider Man. But a hero who wants to be a hero because it is the noble thing to do, to sacrifice himself for God and Country. I think we need someone like that to lift our spirits right now. Is that hero going to be Steve Rogers? But who is Steve Rogers? Rogers (played by Chris Evans) is a skinny, asthmatic kid from Brooklyn who is trying his hardest to enroll in the US Army during World War II to fight the Nazis. His intentions are honest; he hates bullies and wants to help stop the Nazis. He is discovered by Doctor Erksine (played by Stanley Tucci) who recruits him to be involved in an new experiment to make a super solider for the Army. Rogers willing accepts. Things aren't easy for him in boot camp, although he has heart, he is still a weakling. Think of him as the Rudy of the super hero world. He also has Col. Chester Phillips (played by Tommy Lee Jones) who doesn't want him in his Army. To fix all of this Rogers is injected with a serum to turn him from a bean pole to a mega man in literally minutes. After the experiment Rogers doesn't become the super hero Captain America we know today. He is in a holding pattern, the Army finds no use of him and he becomes a pitchman selling war bonds in musicals traveling across the US and war torn Italy. Meanwhile, in Nazi occupied Europe, Super Nazi Johann Schmidt (played by Hugo Weaving) is on his quest to find a blue cube of power so he can supersede from the Nazi army to take over the world himself. He even started his own army, HYDRA, who has a strong belief in folklore and mystical powers. While in Italy Rogers finds out that his best friend is trapped behind enemy lines and soon he makes a daring decision to save him from HYDRA. It is here Rogers truly becomes Captain America and leads his troops home. It is also revealed that Schmidt has a secret similar to Captain America, they both were experiments of Dr. Erskine. While Rogers became Captain America, Schmidt's experiment didn't go as well and he became Red Skull (I think the name says it all). The director, Joe Johnston (Jumanji, The Rocketeer) takes a lazy approach to establish Captain America's heroics by gluing together a montage of fight scenes with no real story to back them up. We see a lot of action for a few minutes then go back to the rest of the story of Captain America on the hunt for Red Skull. Should you see this movie? Sure, being part of the Avengers series makes it somewhat necessary to see it before next year when the Avengers movie is released. As with Iron Man and Thor, it is still a good stand alone movie (Note to Iron Man fans: we are introduced to Tony Stark's father in this film). There is enough action, humor and romance to hold the story together.Jones is the stand-out actor in this troupe with his stern but humorous delivery of his lines. He gives the film some pick up when Evans' lines are falling flat. Spoiler alert: Unlike the other films in this series, don't waste your time waiting for the secret clip after the credits role.",6,3,17,23 July 2011
Unknown," 'Unknown' is Your Father's 'Bourne Identity'
","The title to this review is actually a compliment. 'The Bourne Identity' was a great thriller with a younger cast while 'Unknown' is a great thriller with an older cast. Both provide a good story involving a case of amnesia.I will always stand by my initial reaction from two years ago when I first saw 'Taken.' I felt a bit taken or at least that my money had been taken. Liam Neeson is a fine actor, who at that time, I felt should be more of a dramatic fellow rather than an action guy. I am now taking into consideration his action scenes from 'Star Wars Episode I' and 'The A-Team' and feel that he can hold his own with the action movies.'Unknown' begins with Dr. Martin Harris (played by Liam Neeson) and his much younger wife, Elizabeth (played by January Jones) landing in Berlin for a conference where Martin is scheduled to give a speech. They are about to check into their hotel when Martin realizes that he forgot his briefcase. He jumps into a cab without telling his wife. On the way back to the airport to retrieve his misplaced briefcase, there is an accident where he ends up hitting his head and is in a coma for four days.After Martin awakens, he finds that his wife is still attending the conference but Martin has been replaced by another man (played by Aidan Quinn). Martin (the one played by Neeson) along with audience is confused on what is happening here. He has no way to prove who he is while the imposter has all the correct paper work to prove that he is the real Dr. Harris. It becomes frustrating to be a part of this because logic tells you that the real Dr. Harris is Neeson and not Quinn.The story evolves when Quinn and Neeson are unintentionally synchronizing their dialogue trying to explain who the real Dr. Harris is to another character. It's quite humorous, as it is intended to be. Through this clever story line, the audience is being drawn in closer while Neeson's character is being chased around the city by a mystery man who looks very German. I don't know if it is possible to look 'very' German but this guy did a good job at looking the part.After some running around and a car chase with Martin's (Neeson) new found co-conspirator, Gina (played by Diane Kruger), he ends up asking for assistance from an ex- East Berlin Secret Police officer (the story does take a page from the 'Blatant Coincidence Playbook' but the audience accepts it and moves on with the story). Once the Secret Police are involved, the story goes a little deeper into why Dr. Harris was in Berlin in the first place.The film finally climaxes where all is revealed on why all of this happening. Aside from a few minor plot holes (such as - why didn't Martin use the Internet more to prove who he was?) we are given the answer on why Neeson's character was 'Unknown' and why it all makes sense.Should you see this movie? Yes, it's a good European thriller that will keep you engaged throughout the entire film. There is a car chase that seems tacked on to give the audience a jolt from all of the spoken dialogue. If you liked any of the 'Bourne' movies with their European settings and action sequences, chances are this film will entertain you.",6,18,38,18 February 2011
Invictus," Invictus' action is caught in a scrum
","Invictus (it means unconquered, I had to look it up too) is a story about Nelson Mandela (played by Morgan Freeman) and his quest to unify an apartheid-riddled South Africa through the game of rugby in the early 1990s.The story begins with Mandela's release from prison. He immediately becomes elected president and immediately begins work on bringing his country together. And when I type immediately, I actually mean slowly. The movie drags along at a snail's pace for about an hour. For being a movie dealing with a vicious sport such as rugby, I was expecting it move along quickly and with a lot of brute force such as I would find in a rugby match. I forgot about scrums, which can take a while to produce any kind of action. And, this movie did exactly that.The movie has some very strong moments though. One in particular was where Director Clint Eastwood took a small fraction of the people of South Africa and used them to show what was happening on a larger scale. He did this by focusing on Mandela's security detail. Mandela had rehired the old security detail (a bunch of white guys) to work with his personal bodyguards (a bunch of black guys) to protect him. Mandela used these two groups as an example of how he wanted his fellow countrymen to act. Eastwood couldn't show all 42 million South Africans having disagreements so he took eight people to tell the story of cooperation through their actions. Great job, I get it.So, what about the rugby? Wasn't this supposed to be a movie about rugby? Yes, I think it was supposed to be. It was also a movie about Mandela's quest to bring people together. The rugby was used well, and not knowing enough about the sport, I wasn't totally engulfed by the action scenes. There was one scene where the South African rugby team taught impoverished youths the rules of rugby. Here I wish they had capitalized on the scene more by telling the audience what goes on in a rugby match. It wasn't until the last 20 minutes where we were finally wowed with some gritty rugby action during the 1995 World Cup.Should you see this movie? Tough question. If I say no, I go against the Eastwood/ Freeman establishment, which I don't want to do because I think Freeman should get an Oscar nod for his portrayal of Mandela. If I say yes, I wouldn't say it enthusiastically. So I'll say this, if you want a biopic on Nelson Mandela's life, don't see this movie; and if you want a rough, in- your-face rugby movie, don't see this movie. But, if you want a little bit of both, then by all means take two hours and go see it.",8,1,5,11 December 2009
How to Train Your Dragon," Can Man and Dragon Peacefully coexist?
","'How to Train your Dragon' is the latest digital animation movie from DreamWorks Animation studios (the same studio that produced the Shrek movies, 'Kung Fu Panda,' and 'Bee Movie'). The movie starts off with the narration of the main character, Hiccup (his name is explained in the movie), voiced by Jay Baruchel, describing his Viking hometown and the problems they have with dragons. The audience is thrust into an elaborate action sequence of dragons attacking Hiccup's village. This opening scene does justice to the advancements in digital animation and explores some inventive camera shots of the action and its characters.Young Hiccup wants to be a dragon fighter and have the chance to kill his first dragon. Why does he want to kill a dragon? It means he will be respected among his fellow Vikings. He has one big size issue though, considering the average Viking is four times his size, no one takes him seriously. Villagers ridicule his size often. He resorts to using his intelligence to solve his problems (it seems that for such a young mind he knows quite a bit about aerodynamic engineering). One of his inventions takes down a dreaded night fury dragon. Yet no one believes Hiccup is worthy of being a dragon slayer.The movie moves along smoothly with more being revealed about Hiccup and his situation. Turns out the head of village is also his dad, Stoick, voiced by Gerard Butler. Here is the setup of the traditional kids' movie story line where the child tries to prove himself to his father and/or mother. And yes, we have seen it before and the story is pretty formulaic, but this story does have emotion and well-written dialogue to keep the audience's interest.Hiccup ventures into the woods to find and slay the dragon he had taken down earlier only to find that he cannot kill the dragon. He eventually befriends the beast and learns the traits of the dragon species. There is a humorous and touching development between the boy and the dragon. Toothless (that's Hiccup's name for the new friend) has mood swings from a Clint Eastwood toughness to a Bambie-like curiosity and friendliness. The directors, Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders (both of 'Mulan' and 'Lilo and Stitch' fame), put it together to make this friendship work so it doesn't come off too cheesy.Stoick eventually enrolls Hiccup into a dragon slaying class in the village. In the class, fellow village adolescents learn the proper Viking way to kill different varieties of dragons. What develops is the conflict within Hiccup – should he kill the dragons or should he befriend them? The imagery of the movie is outstanding. The art directors took their time and added the details in the background shots. The water and the fire caught my attention because those elements looked real. I also noticed the hair of the characters (I know I am nitpicking, but in a good way). Considering the era and primitive ways of the Vikings, I could see that their hair was chopped off with a knife. The villagers obviously didn't have a village barber shop. They simply cut their hair with what was available to them. It's a small detail I know, but little things like that made the movie feel realistic.Should you see this movie? Yes, it's a good kid's movie with only a few hidden adult jokes. The action will keep it together and hold your interest until the end. The kids will like the different varieties of dragons and most likely relate to one of the adolescent characters. To paraphrase my 10-year-old daughter — it is a good family story that is funny and yet scary at times (she was referring to the action sequences, but in a good way). One more thing, I saw the movie in 2D and I still feel it was great. Try seeing it in its 3D format; it almost has to be better.",8,4,8,26 March 2010
Thor," 'Thor' the God of Kicking Butt
","First off, I do not consider myself a fan boy or a comic book guy. I grew up on Mad Magazine and their clever fold-ins. The only exposure I had to the comic book 'Thor' was as a kid I received the free copies from my dentist office. I think it was 'Thor vs. the Cavity Creeps' or some lame knock-off like that. When I heard that Thor the God of Thunder was making the transition from comic book to his own big screen movie I was cautious. Who wants to see some guy swing his hammer and speak in Old Norse for two hours? I am man enough to admit when I am wrong (I am also the same guy that doubted 'Ironman' would be a huge success). I was wrong for questioning that stage and screen expert Kenneth Branagh ('Henry V,' 'Much Ado About Nothing'') would not deliver a stellar movie. Branagh has the ability to pull a strong performance from his cast without forcing them to over act. He also has the ability to create a supernatural world, Asgard, where Thor and his family of gods reign. Branagh and his art production team present Asgard as a tangible place for gods to live.In the first few minutes we begin our story in Norway and discover how the Frost Giants come to earth to destroy humans. King Odin (played by Anthony Hopkins) and his army defeat the Frost Giants. We are soon attending a beautiful ceremony where Odin's son Thor (played by Chris Hemsworth) is about to be crowned king of Asgard. Due to a breach in security the ceremony is cut short. Out of anger and vanity Thor gathers his friends to break a truce with the Frost Giants and launches an attack. After Odin discovers what has happened, he furiously banishes his son to Earth, along with Thor's famous hammer, Mjolnir.Thor crash-lands on earth where he is no longer the once powerful god; he is just a regular guy (a regular guy who looks like he's been doing P90X since puberty). A scientist, Jane (played by Natalie Portman) and her team literally runs into Thor. Jane is trying to discover a wormhole between our world and others in the universe. The two soon realize that they each have what the other one wants and soon become allies.This is the part where you should start paying close attention. Not because you get a history lesson on Norse mythology but because Marvel Studios is combining their super heroes to make an 'Avengers' movie in 2012. Thor will be one of the Avengers and there are quite a few references of these heroes and characters from the Marvel Universe - Hawkeye, Ironman, Phil Coulson from S.H.I.E.L.D., etc.Thor, now without his powers, must be reunited with his mighty hammer, which as fate would have is only 50 miles from him. While Thor is fighting to win back his hammer and return to Asgard, his brother Loki (played by Tom Hiddleston), the God of Mischief, is stirring up trouble between the Frost Giants and Asgard. The entire story climaxes in a way that you would imagine with any comic book movie; good vs. evil, cocky hero learns a valuable lesson, several awesome fight scenes, that whole thing.Should you see this movie? Yes. It's has action, humor and some outstanding art direction to develop the mythical worlds. Do you need to see it in 3D? Not necessarily. The 3D was too dark in some of the action scenes at night and didn't add much to the day time scenes.

The Blind Side," Blindsided
","OK, OK, so I was your typical reviewer who saw the trailers to 'The Blind Side' and expected another football movie where a 'one-in-a-million shot' with a lot of heart goes on to win the Super Bowl or national championship. And, when everything was said and done I would come home and write a review using the words 'tear jerker' or 'uplifting' or 'scores a touchdown.' Then I started to write this review and realized that it was all of those things plus a lot more.'The Blind Side' is the story of Michael Oher, (played by Quinton Aaron), a teenager from a broken home with a troubled past who goes onto become an NFL draft pick. His story, as portrayed in this particular film, is not about how he laid awake every night dreaming of someday playing in the NFL. In fact, the NFL was only mentioned at the end of the movie where it actually showed the real Michael Oher being drafted by the Baltimore Ravens. This movie was all about the journey.It starts with Sandra Bullock's character, Leigh Anne Touhy, narrating and describing the importance of an offensive tackle (something I knew very little about) and moves into Michael being allowed a shot to go to a private school in Memphis. The young man does have a rough life, pretty much homeless, no family, no friends and extremely introverted. By fate, Leigh and her family take Michael in for a night and they become his surrogate parents for a while. They clothe him and shelter him and help him bring his grades up in school.All along, Michael isn't saying more than a few words at a time. I think this was the strong area of the movie. This gentle giant brought out the best intentions around a lot of the characters in the story. We've all seen the football movies where the gifted athlete comes in and says a lot of smart-ass lines then butts heads with the coach and realizes he needs to listen in order to learn. Well, this movie takes a different approach (and since it was based on a true story I think this was the only approach he had to work with). Michael kept quiet most of the time and the people around him learned a lot about helping another human being.Should you see this movie? Definitely. Yes. Even if you think you have seen this football formula before, you haven't. The movie used comedy to bring it to life. It used Michael's silence at the right times to make it stick. They thought this movie through before they started filming. Why else should you see it? Because it was an uplifting, tearjerker that will score a touchdown. (There, I typed the words and I enjoyed doing it).",6,25,43,20 November 2009
Rango," 'Rango' Thirsts for Originality
","In a year that will be bringing us more than 20 remakes, reboots or sequels, it seems that Hollywood is having troubles in the originality department. What's left other than taking an unoriginal idea and adding on some really cool, yet sometimes unneeded, 3-D imagery? It's like putting a rear spoiler on a 1979 Camaro. It doesn't really need to be done but it looks so cool.The creative team at Nickelodeon Movies understood that we don't always need the latest technology crammed down our throats. Sometimes taking a somewhat imaginative idea and developing the 2-D imagery works just as well.'Rango' begins with a scene of a thespian lizard (voiced by Johnny Depp) with an over active imagination putting on a stage play by himself in his glass case of existence. He is doing a fine job of entertaining himself although he knows that there is more to life. He is the lizard with no name; this leads him to question his own existence. Pretty deep for a kids' movie, huh? Our soon-to-be hero becomes stranded in the middle of the Mojave Desert (which includes a quick homage to one of Depp's earlier cult films). Only being in his new location for a few moments, he has caught the attention of a very hungry hawk. After an extensive, action-packed chase our hero ends up in the hands of a lovely lizard named Beans (voiced by Isla Fisher). She agrees to bring him to the town of Dirt.Once there, our soon-to-be hero finds that by using his self-taught acting skills, he can make up any story and become someone else. The townsfolk of Dirt don't know any better but to believe his wild tales.Things are going well for our hero, who through a clever lie came up with the moniker of Rango. The townsfolk are convinced that Rango had killed seven other men with one bullet. Soon that pesky, hungry hawk comes back and by pure luck Rango kills the hawk cleverly yet unwittingly with one bullet. Because of this innocent heroic act the mayor (voiced by Ned Beatty) soon makes Rango the sheriff of Dirt.There are some problems that come with being the sheriff of Dirt. As a matter of fact, the town is in its worst drought in years and the last of the water supply is stolen. Rango, still believing his own lies that he is actually courageous, leads a posse to find who stole the water.Eventually the townsfolk are shown the true Rango when Rattlesnake Jake (voiced by Bill Nighy) shows up to reclaim his right to be the town villain. Rango chickens out and goes back to being a coward. After a brief discussion (albeit, a discussion under delusions from the dehydration) with another famous 'man with no name' Rango mans up, or lizards up, and goes back to try to save the town and to reclaim the water supply.Should you see this movie? Maybe, if it was in 3D it would be so much better. I'm kidding. Because this is animated feature you might have the notion to bring small children. This is not the case. There are some adult elements here that would be lost on the younger audience. This would be more of film for the ages 8-13 if anything.The cast was wonderful at voicing their characters. However, the thick old west accents were difficult to understand at times. With the imagery, lighting and shadowing of the computer images, it was pleasant picture to watch. Being set in a desert, I really felt thirsty during the film. Just be sure to drink plenty of water before you go.",6,0,2,4 March 2011
Despicable Me," 'Despicable Me' – See it with your favorite minions.
","They are never going stop, are they? Kids' movies, that is. Hollywood is going to keep churning them out year after year until one day someone stands up to say, 'I think we have had just about enough pandering to this market. The jokes have been cut, edited, rehashed, and remixed to fit every possible demographic. We have taken the imagery and 3D format to an all-time high. Let this sleeping dog lie for a while and go focus our efforts elsewhere.' I don't see it happening any time soon and I only saw a glimpse of the standard kids' movie formula deviating slightly in 'Despicable Me.' We are introduced to Gru (voiced by Steve Carell), the film's protagonist/ antagonist, right after a major landmark goes missing. The audience is supposed to deduce that Gru has a history of being an evil genius. No real example of his evil doings is given until he delivers a speech to his minions. He makes plans to get back on top after it is reported that another supervillain stole the major landmark. It's all about ego with these supervillains.Gru has a team of hundreds of little, yellow minions who speak in undecipherable chirps. They work in his laboratory and research facility. He also has a mad scientist, Dr. Nerfario (voiced by Russell Brand) that converts Gru's orders into actual working devices. There is a humorous downfall here. Nerfario doesn't hear the orders so well and the wrong items are developed.Gru is soon faced with an obstacle that is not part of the standard formula; he is a super evil power with money issues. The movie brings up a valid point: where do these guys get their financing? Out of all the superheroes and super villains in movies, I can't think of a time where this issue has been addressed. With the state of the economy being as it is, now is a good time for a movie to bring up money issues. The story breaks character and it's not about the kids at this point, Mom and Dad are now drawn closer to the story. They think, 'Hey that's right, I just paid $40 to get my family of four into this theater and I had to take out a second mortgage to pay for sodas and popcorn. I totally get what this guy is going through.' (Sorry for the dose of realism on the situation, but do the math, going to the movies isn't cheap).Gru meets with the Mr. Perkins (voiced by Will Arnett), the president of the Bank of Evil, to ask for a loan. At the same time we are introduced to Vector (voiced by Jason Segel), Gru's soon-to-be arch nemesis. The back and forth quickly begins for power of a shrink ray. Gru needs the shrink ray to apply for his loan and to complete his plan to steal the moon. Vector just needs it to keep the story going. Vector was funny for about five minutes, as far as enemies are concerned, he is five years too late. His catch phrases and body gestures have been done over and over again in similar kiddy flicks. Like chewing bubble gum, the flavor didn't last for long.To keep the story going and to give the kids something to connect with we are introduced to three orphaned girls that Gru incorporates into his plan by adopting them. The orphans unknowingly help Gru break into Vector's fortress to steal the shrink ray back. After that plan goes accordingly, Gru tries to ditch them at an amusement park but after a day with the girls, he finds that his tough exterior is slowly being chiseled away by their childish antics and puppy dog eyes. It's cute, too cute. Couple that with the adorable mannerisms of the minions and we are talking about some serious charm. On the cuteness scale of 1-10 you can rate this at an 11 or 12. (These minions will also be great plush toys, which means Mom and Dad's trip to the movie just tacked on a trip to the toy store and another $30.) Once Gru takes a liking to these three orphans the conflict between him and Vector climaxes. Mix in the fact that the date of Gru's evil plan coincides with the dates of the orphans' dance recital. Lastly add a dash of change-of-heart-syndrome to the final scenes. Have you heard this one before? I have a feeling you know how it will end.Should you see this movie? I think you already have. But, see it again for the minions; they do bring a new, fun feel to the story line. Put the kids in the car; fill up on $3 per gallon gas; stop for dinner on the way to the theater, $50; enjoy the movie in 3D, $40; buy the toys, $30; and enjoy the time with the kids because it is all new to them. Priceless.",7,5,11,9 July 2010
Win Win," 'Win Win' is a Draw.
","The average American is overweight. The average American is in credit card debt. The average American is struggling to pay their monthly mortgage. Paul Giamatti understands who the average American is and he understands how to portray the average American on film. He is probably one of the few famous actors who doesn't have to spend a lot of time at the gym preparing for a role. With his 'everyman' look, he can deliver an average character in which most middle-aged audience members can relate.'Win Win' is the latest independent story from director Thomas McCarthy featuring Giamatti as Mike Flaherty, a local attorney in a small town in New Jersey (although, this small town could have been anywhere in the United States). McCarthy did a splendid job of setting the stage of this quaint town. After the first five minutes, I wanted to pull up a chair at the local Dunkin Donuts and have a coffee with the townspeople.Mike is struggling to make ends meet, yet he has an overwhelming disgust of having to take a regular job to provide for his family. His marriage to Jackie (played by Amy Ryan) is fine but his law practice is struggling. He has a particular client, Leo Poplar (played by Burt Young), who is slipping into dementia and is in need of constant attention. Mike sees an opportunity here. Leo is going to be forced out of his home and into a nursing home. Leo also has quite a bit of money; in fact he pays out a large monthly commission to his caretaker. Mike sees an opportunity to take that monthly commission and put Leo in a nursing home. Mike is a good person with good intentions, but like the rest of the working class folks, he has the common desire to provide for his family.After Mike puts Leo in his nursing home, we are introduced to Kyle (played by Alex Shaffer, in his only film role to date). Kyle is a runaway from his mother in Ohio. He shows up unannounced and starts taking the focus of the film. Kyle is a strong willed yet extremely quiet and pleasant young man. He also brings with him a mystery of why he left Ohio in the first place.As part of Mike's contribution to the community he coaches high school wrestling. The wrestling team is lacking in the 'wins' category. It turns out that Kyle is an exceptional wrestler. Just what Mike needs. Mike's family takes Kyle in and also starts understanding his story and why he is running away from his mom, who is in a drug rehab facility.The story moves in the general direction that you would expect from a story like this. Kid runs away from home; mom follows to repair a broken relationship; kid finds out the man that he trusted is a liar; mom wants her dad's monthly commission; conflict arises and a solution is found. I hate to give a broad-brush stroke like that but it's a simple movie that doesn't offer too much excitement. Taking into consideration that it is a movie involving a high intensity contact sport such as wrestling I would expect a little more action and intensity from the pace of the film.Should you see this movie? Maybe. It does deliver a story with solid acting and character development. I do see Shaffer moving up in his career using this film as a launching pad. During the movie, I kept thinking that he reminds me of a young Sean Penn, not a 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High' Penn, but a 'Taps' or 'Bad Boys' Penn. Shaffer has a recognizable intensity and more importantly a believability to him. This isn't a story about wrestling or a story about deception or even a story about forgiveness. It's a story giving the audience a two-hour window viewing Americana in modern times.",6,3,6,8 April 2011
RED," 'Red.' A Romantic Comedy for Guys
","Let's get this on the table now, I am an American man. I like red meat, apple pie, baseball and women who are armed and dangerous. I ask for nothing more. Well, one more thing, if one of those armed and dangerous women could also have been a recipient of an Oscar for portraying the Queen of England. 'Red' is an acronym, in CIA terminology, for Retired and Extremely Dangerous. The film is based on the graphic novel of the same name. Directed by Robert Schwentke and employs a multitude of great actors and actresses who bring the story to life. The story provides a whirlwind of travel from one American city to the next. While using the film's time wisely to unravel clues about who is trying to kill the ex-CIA team from a 1981 Colombian CIA operation.We begin the film with ex-CIA agent Frank Moses (played by Bruce Willis) who is living a meager day-to-day life with no excitement and no cause to look forward to the future. He wakes up alone, he eats alone, and he even takes out the recycle bin alone. Most recently he decorated his home for the Christmas holiday when he realized his was the only house on the block that was barren. He does everything a good citizen must do in suburban Cleveland, Ohio to keep up appearances. He has one ray of sunshine in his life. He makes calls to his customer service rep at the pension services office, Sarah Ross (played Mary-Louise Parker), to hear her voice and talk about romance novels. Sarah, too, is miserable in her dead-end job. We see an over the phone connection between the two characters. If you have seen one romantic comedy in your life, you will see what is going on here. Two lonely souls make a connection but are separated by two cities. However, in 'Red' one of the lonely souls is an ex-CIA killer, you won't find that in the typical romantic comedy formula. Late one night Frank gets up to go to the kitchen and is attacked by a CIA team of killers. Grenades are thrown, machine guns are fired, bullets are fried in a pan (really it happens) and we are following Frank to Kansas City, Mo. to pick up Sarah to let her know that she is in trouble. From there we are yanked down to New Orleans to find Frank's old CIA buddy Joe Matheson (played by Morgan Freeman). While in the French Quarter we are entertained with an amazing shot of Frank exiting a spinning cop car to unload an entire clip from his handgun into the windshield of his would-be assailant, William Cooper (played by Karl Urban). I am done telling you about the story line. It's a good story line but I have to tell you I haven't seen action from an experienced cast like this in a long time. Sure I can compare this to 'The A-Team' and 'The Losers.' Sure it has the basic story line about a team of special ops killers who are doubled crossed and they need to find out who is behind it all. But, I want to tell you what great fun it is to watch someone who portrayed a queen (Helen Mirren) take a firing stance behind a .50 caliber machine gun to mow down a limousine. I want to tell you how someone who once drove 'Miss Daisy' (Freeman) and the guy who once played Biff Loman in 'Death of a Salesman' (John Malkovich) interrogate the nerdy marine biologist from 'Jaws' (Richard Dreyfuss). I can't forget to tell you how the guy from 'Die Hard' (Willis) is back doing what Americans love to watch him do – eliminate the bad guys with a calm, cool attitude. We, the people, deserve this movie, we have earned the right to put $10 down at the box office and say 'give me four A-list actors with lots of explosions and car chases and even a little romance. Because after a summer of watching sub-par movies we need to be reminded how much fun it is to hear old people jokes. Then see those 'old people' exact their revenge on the system.'Should you see this movie? Are you a red-blooded American? Then yes, go see it. This is your right to turn off your mind for a while and be grateful that you live in a country where you can watch absurd violent behavior by retirees. While all along you see a loving relationship between a man and woman blossom before your eyes.",8,11,23,15 October 2010
The Social Network," Jason Gregg Likes 'The Social Network'
","I know it is pretentious of me to place my name in the title of my review. But, after leaving David Fincher's film 'The Social Network,' I could only feel arrogant and overly confident. The movie has a strong, young cast of characters who play their roles with enormous confidence that radiates off of the screen.Jesse Eisenberg plays Mark Zuckerberg, the co-founder of Facebook, with such unwarranted cockiness I wanted to punch him in his smug little face in the first 10 minutes. The film brings us closer to see more than the hyper-intelligent boy genius and by the end, I wanted to add him as a friend on Facebook or at least 'like' him.David Fincher (the director of 'Fight Club,' 'Seven') and his screenwriter Aaron Sorkin (screenwriter for 'The West Wing,' 'Charlie Wilson's War') based the movie on the book 'The Accidental Billionaires' by Ben Mezrich. Facebook and the actual Mark Zuckerberg wanted nothing to do with the film.The story begins in 2003 at a bar where Mark is being dumped by his girlfriend, Erica Albright (played by Rooney Mara). This one opening scene sets the over-analytical persona of Mark for the entire film. Is he arrogant? A bit. Is he too smart for his own good? Definitely. Does he understand that his intelligence can make others feel inferior? Only after he sees what he has done does he feel any type of remorse or regret.After being dumped, a hurt Mark goes back to his dorm, has a few drinks and starts blogging about how much he despises his new ex-girlfriend. All in one night he develops a Web site where Harvard classmates can rate the attractiveness of other students and the site crashes Harvard's computer network. Not bad for a night's work.Through his actions, Mark garners the attention of a set of twins, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss (both played by Armie Hammer), who are starting their own Web site similar to MySpace and Friendster. They hire Mark to help develop the site and grow it into something that they could never do on their own. And here's where the trouble begins. Mark begins to play both sides of the field to borrow startup money from his best friend, Eduardo Saverin (played by Andrew Garfield), and at the same time he takes the Winklevoss' initial idea to develop his own site.Since Mark Zuckerberg (the actual guy) and Facebook have distanced themselves from the film, it has intrigued many people to want to know more. That is going to be the driving force behind the box office sales. To better illustrate this point, there is a scene in the film where Zuckerberg and Eduardo meet with the founder of Napster, Sean Parker (played by Justin Timberlake. Added sidebar: I think it is great that Fincher had someone from the music industry play the guy who was responsible for ripping off that same industry). In this scene, the trio is discussing how to market Facebook. Eduardo wants to get advertisers on board ASAP while Mark and Sean wants to let Facebook grow before they start trying to make money off the deal. Let the users determine the growth of the product. Fincher and Sorkin did the exact same thing with the promotion of this film. If Facebook said yes to the film then it would look like a Pro-Facebook campaign. Start a conflict, let people think that this is Facebook's dirty little secret on how it all started and the rest will take care of itself.About halfway through, you start realizing that this film is no longer about Facebook, in fact it could be a story about any product or service on the market today. Fincher doesn't spend much time focusing on the actual Web site. He focuses on Mark's two legal depositions that are happening simultaneously and the human and financial wreckage caused by his actions. This film is simply about greed and the want for more. Not necessarily more money, that wasn't Zuckerberg's intention when he started his site. He wanted to fit in with the rest of us. He couldn't find an opening to the exclusive clubs on Harvard's prestigious campus so he stared his own club.Should you see this movie? Yes. But, not because you have a Facebook profile that you like to update every hour. This film is not about Facebook. This is a captivating lesson in human relationships. It is a window to the deep, dark soul of capitalism. It's about living with past regrets.",8,1,8,1 October 2010
The Fighter," 'The Fighter' is This Year's Strong Contender
","Do we need another boxing movie? After seeing several boxing films over the years they all seem the same. Take a story of a struggling boxer who will do anything for his shot at the title. Then through hard work and determination he earns his shot and he gets the girl. It seems like a cookie cutter format that audiences come to expect. So, do we need 'The Fighter?' Yes we do.'The Fighter' (directed by David O. Russell) is based on the true story of brothers Micky Ward and Dicky Eklund. And, if it weren't for the outstanding cast this would have been another boxing movie trying to make a buck.We start the story in Lowell, Mass. in 1993. Dicky (played by Christian Bale) is being interviewed by an HBO film crew for a documentary about crack cocaine users in Lowell. All the while, Dicky has convinced himself that it is a documentary about his comeback. Back in the 1970s, Dicky was known as the 'Pride of Lowell' for his boxing career. Thanks to Bale's ability to become the characters that he plays, the audience is taken on a journey. First we despise Dicky for his addiction. Then we tolerate him for his playfulness and lovability. Then finally we are cheering for his redemption.This couldn't be an entire movie about a crack-head ex-boxer who redeems himself. At the start we are introduced to Dicky's brother Micky (played by Mark Wahlberg), who is known as a 'stepping stone,' in boxing terms that means other boxers fight him to move up in their own careers. This role seems to fit Wahlberg quite well. In some of his other films he has an unintentional trademark of looking constantly perplexed. But, in this film his confused expressions play to his strength. Micky is being torn in several directions from his brother, his mother, his sisters and his new girlfriend, Charlene (played by Amy Adams). He needs to look confused throughout the story; he simply doesn't know who to trust.While Dicky is training with Micky, their mother Alice (played by Melissa Leo) is managing Micky's career just the same as she managed Dicky's career. She smokes like a chimney and lives proudly with the fact that she managed Dicky in his prime while raising nine children.Speaking of the nine children, the two brothers have seven sisters to contend with throughout the film. The casting for these seven women was perfect. It makes me wonder if a group of actresses could be nominated for Best Supporting Actress. These women made the film fun with their heavy, snide 'Bah-ston' accents, wicked glares, tough-as-nails attitudes and their hair styles which looked like they needed building permits (after all it was 1993).We see only one boxing match in the first half of the film. Russell wanted us to focus on Dicky's crack addiction, Micky's struggle to find balance in his life and Alice's determination to get her sons known in the boxing world. At the turning point in the film, Dicky becomes incarcerated and Micky takes on a new manager and drops Dicky as his trainer. He employs Mickey O'Keefe who was the real life mentor for Micky. We are finally introduced to a montage of fights where Micky works his way up to and finally given his shot at the title.Should you see this movie? Yes. Not only for the story, but because you can see about 12 performances of actors and actresses that were made for these roles. Russell was able to bring out the strengths of each one of the cast. In return he gives the audience a film that felt new even if we have seen it before.",8,3,5,17 December 2010
