The Hangover," One of the funniest movies that I have seen in a loooong time.
","I have to say that it was so refreshing to watch a comedy movie that had all the right elements going on and kept you there laughing even as the credits were rolling. Unbelievably good, very refreshing to see a great comedy when it seemed as if the whole genre was getting stale. What I liked most was this story just kept throwing one twist after another, your just completely left guessing as to what was going to happen next. The premise is the group has lost one of their foursome overnight and none of them can remember where he might have ended up. It's a great plot vehicle because you find yourself so intrigued as well and it almost plays out as a mystery, albeit, an extremely hilarious mystery movie. Just brilliant, inspired writing here, they took a great premise and really went with it and the movie does not let up. You get really hooked on the characters and I found myself rooting for them all and it makes for a really great ending. Simply great, best comedy I have seen in years.",9,1,3,17 December 2009
Apocalypse Now," In my opinion, Coppola's best work
","My favourite movie of all time. This was a flawed piece of work by Coppola and seeing the documentary 'Heart of Darkness' made it even more compelling. Coppola at this point was king of Hollywood after making 'the Godfather' and 'GodfatherII' and had developed the ego necessary to even dare try to make a movie like 'Apocalypse Now'. Through sheer arrogance he went to the Phillipines with a partial script and thought he would know what he would do when he got there. Just as Captain Willard thought he would know what to do once he got to Col. Kurtz's compound. And just like Willard, he DIDN'T know what he was going to do once he got there. This is such a masterpiece of American cinema, beautifully photographed and the river is such a perfect metaphor and backdrop for the story. What I like most about 'Apocalypse Now' is that it offers no answers or conclusions. Consequently, because of this open-endedness, it infuriates some viewers who like their movies to be much more obvious. This movie defies categorization. Some call it a war movie which it isn't at all, really it is more of a personal study of man. The best pic about Vietnam is 'Platoon' in my opinion and if a viewer is seeking a retelling of the Vietnam War go there first for answers. Coppola should be commended for his take on the bureaucracy of war which he conveys quite effectively with the meeting with Gen.Corman and Lucas (Harrison Ford) and the Playmate review. The sheer audacity of Kilgore makes him an unforgettable character and the dawn attack will always be a Hollywood classic.It is an almost psychedelic cruise to a very surreal ending which makes it a movie not accessible to everyone. Very challenging to watch but rewarding as well. I could offer my explanations on each scene but that would be totally pointless. This movie is intended for interpretation and contemplation as opposed to immediate gratification.A little footnote, definitely if your a first-time viewer of Apocalypse Now, watch the original version first, the 'Redux' version is, I think, more intended for the hardcore fan and is more of a curiosity than a 'new and improved' version of the movie",10,595,729,21 December 2004
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," A very fine piece of art.
","This is such a welcome break from the usual that I had to pause and give praise. The lengthy title of the movie essentially explains the plot, a synopsis of events leading up to the assassination of Jesse James. The title character at this point has become somewhat of a tragic Shakespearean hero, full of doubt and fear, and his mind full of questions as to the loyalty of his minions. Pitt's performance is admirable, probably his best yet and I have much admiration as well for Casey Affleck as Robert Ford, who effectively conveys a young man who loses respect for his idol as he grows closer to him.The real star of the movie in my mind, is the cinematographer, Roger Deakins, who use of subtle lighting, panoramic views of the Canadian prairies and the occasional blurred filters to convey a dreamlike quality when necessary. If I had one fault with the movie it would be that the poetic musings of these romanticized outlaws can be sometimes hard to make out clearly, but it is a small fault and it gives me good reason to watch it again, which I will very soon. Brad Pitt and Ridley Scott are to be commended for taking a hand in producing this lovely bit of cinema, it is not going to be a big money maker but certainly a work that all who were involved with must be very proud of. I always wonder if the western will ever become a genre that will run out of steam due to a sense of it's all been done now. After watching this, I can say that the western may never die as a genre. Absolutely beautiful.",9,2,4,16 November 2008
Super 8," Not much going for it...
","I have not seen anything from the series 'Lost' which made J.J. Abrams famous so I didn't come into this movie with high expectations and it's a good thing I didn't either. I just found so much of the action sequences flat, the characters weren't really all that engaging and the story pretty much non-existent. It had really good potential early on with the train crash and played the mystery up fairly well and then the payoff was just not there at all. So much of the action and the entire movie for that matter happens in darkness which makes it easy for F/X department but just made it confusing and tiring for me. The dialogue was hard to pick up, it seemed like the kids were mumbling a lot or something, and what lines you did hear was pure corn. I really have no idea why this was a period piece set in the late '70's either, there was really no reason for it and there was little there to indicate it was the '70's. There was a 'Super8' camera in use and they had to wait for the film to be developed but the 3 day wait wasn't much a of a plot device. Just a really poor movie with very little story, which basically hacked 'E.T' for inspiration. I was expecting something more from a Spielberg production. I get the feeling that Abrams was offered a shot at making a movie but he didn't really have much of an idea what to do for a movie. Very disappointing.",3,2,4,27 May 2012
