Blade Runner 2049," Not Terrible But Fails To Live Up - Light Spoilers
","BR2049 is not a terrible film but it really fails to live up to the classic original Blade Runner (1982), even the inferior cuts of Blade Runner.It is far, far too long. The visuals are stunning but the story is very thin (yet still has holes) and does not justify anywhere near the screen time.The music misses the mark. The sound is good and hits the right notes with the music but Vangellis' score was a big part of the original that is sadly mostly absent here. And a lot of the sound cues are just brief and blasted at us as if to say 'HERE IS THE BLADE RUNNER SOUND!'The story like I said is very thin. The runner finds everything easily and we know what is going to happen. When we see the flower by the tree do they really need to drag that 'discovery' on for so long? The discovery of the wooden horse takes forever too, even though we know exactly what is happening long before that. Everything drags in this movie and it's not like they are creating tension or anything. The emotion is also flat.They deliberately abandon avenues (the new corporate evil puppet master) and obviously are hoping to do more sequels.There are annoying nonsensical happenings too, logic holes and lots of questions unanswered.Here are some of my issues after watching this, and this is where light SPOILERS are---- Olmos does everything but say 'Deckard is a replicant' but if so why does he age just like a human? Replicants can have kids now but they don't even explore how or why? Vegas is in a radioactive cloud but Deckard lives there no problem... even if it's safe now wouldn't all the food supplies there be irradiated? If it is safe there now why is he the only one living there in luxury? Gosling sure gets over the loss of his 'wife' fast. Gosling's police chief just takes his word that he killed his target even though he is a replicant himself who fails his baseline test, when the stakes are a full-on war with replicants? Why is the police chief in charge of this hugely important security issue? The Lov/her boss issue is just abandoned. These are just the issues off the top of my head.Again the main problem is the ponderous run time for no apparent reason.In the plus column are good acting (Gosling's not great in this but doesn't have much to work with, same for Harrison Ford, other supporting characters are good).Also the visuals like I said are incredible.",5,2,6,17 January 2019
Sucker Punch," Terrible Movie, Nice Visual Effects
","This movie is just really, really bad on almost every front. The worst writing, annoying characters with no logic, bad acting. It's just so stupid. The only plus were the sometimes stunning computer effects. I saw it in a theater and it was actually really neat.",2,2,9,18 March 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Star Wars Turned Into a Microwaved Turd
","This movie is almost total garbage. If it wasn't for the great score, some decent (though completely wasted) acting by a few of the actors, and as usual the fantastic effects, I'd be happy to give this a zero out of ten.The writing is the biggest problem they have. As other reviewers here have pointed out, JJ Abrams, whats-her-name and Disney have completely betrayed the Star Wars franchise with sloppy, lazy, revisionist storytelling. This borrows many of the best parts of the original trilogy but slaps them together in a haphazard way to make what is much more a commercial for new toys and video games than a movie.Say what you want about Lucas, the original trilogy showed actual vision and creativity. Those are stories, characters and moments you actually remember. This finale to the series? It's just a mess of effects and dumb 'big' moments.Finn seems to exist only to whine about his emotions and yell. Seriously he's only got a handful of lines and always yells them. 'Rey!!!' 'Chewy!!!' 'We gotta go!!!' Also he apparently has something he wants to tell Rey but never did, which is mentioned a few times, and then he just never tells her and disappears and nobody even cares because he's so annoying now.Lando finally returns and does, well, pretty much nothing ever than sit in a desert planet vehicle (one of a zillion cool new toys for the kids) and deliver expository dialogue. 'Oh yeah the way-finder, I actually came here with Luke to look for it many years ago but even though he has the force and can feel such things and the magic dagger key is just a few feet underground by his ship we just couldn't find it. So anyway, then I guess we just forgot about it or whatever and also didn't mention it to Leia or anybody...'People have mentioned the Mary Sue-ness of Rey, and they should. It's pretty bad.Yes, she has 'The Force' but even that has its limits, or at least it did in all previous films in this franchise. Seriously, all of a sudden people can bring each other back from the dead? That scene where cousins Rey and Kylo kiss each other was so stupid and awkward the people in the theater laughed - literally laughed - at what was supposed to be a deep, meaningful moment. It was such a predictable, bizarre, dumb cliche, and they still did it?! Why were they kissing and why does that all of a sudden bring people back to life? It's all nonsense.Rey having parents who were nobodies was actually good, and original... all of a sudden having Emperor Palpatine say 'I am your GRANDfather!' Yup. Just take exactly what Darth Vader said to Luke and, since it was good, just do it again. It's apparently not enough that you already recycled the entire original Star Wars film to do the first movie in your prequel trilogy. Gee whiz.How Palpatine was handled is one of the most blatant examples of poor writing in this film. It's almost three hours long yet they just dump it on us in the opening crawl. 'So anyway Emperor Palpatine is still alive...' What?! How about giving us a cool reveal, or a storyline? We're thinking 'well that's lazy writing but at least we'll get a cool flashback of how he managed to survive Vader throwing him down the shaft in ROTJ' - but no. All we get is some throwaway line of 'something something Sith clone technology' or 'special abilities' or whatever. Anyway, he's the Big Bad, so obviously we get a great final fight right? Nope. Rey stops him with a Skywalker light sabre and then defeats him when she remembers she has a SECOND light sabre! She just uses them to deflect his lightning hands and slowly walks toward him until he dies. The end. Really, the end?!Carrie Fisher's scenes are awkward, which we can cut them slack for because she sadly passed away. But I can't help but think that, even using the footage they had of her in this movie, they could have cobbled together a better story with her. She's just kind of there, listening to people and not responding (just looking back at them), and saying things completely disconnected from what other people are talking about. Anyway, at some point she just lays down and then dies and disappears... because Ben dies apparently? But hey, at least they don't have her flying around in space... again!Too much is recycled. Remember the cool scene in the original trilogy where they hide in the dumped trash to escape the Empire? Only to then have Boba Fett's ship come to life and follow them away? Even that is redone. The throne room fight is basically redone.The fact that this trilogy is STILL miles better than the prequel trilogy says a lot about how awful the Jar-Jar era films were.I hope at some point they actually make the sequel trilogy that George Lucas wrote years ago. There's no real downside to it, is there? They'll once again rake in billions. Maybe that was their plan all along? Who knows. I just wish that either they'd hire somebody who can actually fix this thing, or that they had never made any sequels to begin with and just left the story at the original, classic trilogy.",2,11,17,18 February 2020
Avatar," I didn't hate it but didn't like it much either, here's why......
","I went in with zero expectations, also to let you know where I am coming from I saw this just today (2019) on BluRay, so not exactly what I'm sure is the intended 'big screen' way to see this, and not ideal sound either.That said, from word of mouth and reviews I knew that the visuals and stunning CGI were the main selling point of this movie but technology moves so fast that I think my expectations were too high on this point and the effects here have already been surpassed. I've seen better recently, including in the Star Wars movies (for better or worse), so the effects in Avatar I found good (particularly the more background stuff, like the 'world' the characters walked through), but not STUNNING. This is mostly true of the characters which I didn't think looked awesome at all.As for the acting, I have no problems with it. Worthington wasn't awesome but certainly was good. I like Weaver in whatever work she does. The supporting cast were all good. And Stephen Lang stole every scene he was in. It's great to see actually because I see him pop up now and then but until now I've never seen him in a really big, successful blockbuster. He may seem like an overnight success to many but he's been around forever (as a kid I remember him doing a great job in a show called Crime Story along with a similarly gifted and surprisingly versatile actor named Ted Levine) doing all kinds of roles and always doing a good job with it.So visuals were passable (obviously they were stunning at the time and are still impressive a decade later which is good). And the acting was good. Which brings us to the real failing here, the story.As other reviewers have said this story is very, very unoriginal. Seen-it-before plot points and tropes are piled on top of each other and nothing comes as a surprise. It's slapdash thrown together pieces of Ferngully, etc, etc... natives and nature vs. progress and development. 'Oh my gosh we are the bad guys!'And it is ponderously overlong given the basic story, and how predictable it all is. I don't think this story surprised us once even in 3 hours (oh also the version I watched was the extended collector's edition - maybe that is not as good as the theatrical?)...Actually it is a testament to the quality of the visuals, the cinematography, the actors (working in CGI world), and James Cameron's direction that this overlong heard-it-all-before story never actually gets unbearably boring. It wasn't good but was never boring.I would give the sequels a chance, and will definitely be seeing the next one in the theater. Still the story will need to be much more original, much better, and frankly to be considered an all time great I think a movie should have more staying power than just a few years. It already feels old to me, and it isn't sticking with me (I'm not thinking about it at all really) the way I feel 'good movies' do.Just my two cents.",3,1,2,19 January 2019
Saw," Great Horror
","This is a great low budget horror film. It is not predictable like almost all horror movies are, and the performances are good.",10,1,3,3 March 2020
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," Disgusting Doesn't Make It Art
","This movie is disgusting. Seriously if you watch this all the way through you must be sick, if you actually like this movie there is something seriously wrong with you. It's nothing but horror-porn.",1,7,17,8 January 2019
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Horror Classic
","I loved this movie when it came out, and still love it today. It's visually stunning with appropriate creepiness and gore, with great jump scares. The acting is top notch - who doesn't like Gary Oldman and Anthony Hopkins? A great effort all the way around. Wonderful story too, truly based on Bram Stoker's classic novel.",10,0,0,19 January 2020
Black Panther," Most Overrated
","This is one of the most overrated movies I have ever seen. Maybe my expectations were way too high going into it. The effects and acting were OK but it was way too long, very boring, and had a stupid story that seemed like it was written by a child. Nothing surprising, interesting or funny. Very basic.",2,29,50,20 December 2018
Cube," Amazing
",This is an amazing low budget sci-fi film set in a single location (basically). Very well done with superb acting. The sequels unfortunately don't do it justice.,10,0,0,2 March 2020
Alien: Covenant," Very Disappointing & Detracts from the Franchise
","This movie was very disappointing to me. The visuals are great with all the typical jump scares and bloody, body horror you'd want and expect from an Alien movie. The acting was also good, particularly Waterston and Fassbender. But the writing is just not up to par with this one. The story seems like a thrown together mess that they didn't bother to think through properly. Especially disappointing is the incredibly predictable 'twist' at the end. Everyone knows exactly what is coming so what's the point of even doing it? I don't want to give any spoilers but none of the characters deliver any surprises and most of them just exist to be killed at some point by the aliens. The backstory of the manufactured disease/alien xenomorphs is also just bizarre and for me it detracts from the overall mythos of the Alien franchise storyline. Hopefully the next film gets this franchise back on track. I really enjoyed Prometheus for what it was, but they're really going down a bad road here and I'm not sure they'll be able to repair the damage done.",3,2,5,10 June 2019
