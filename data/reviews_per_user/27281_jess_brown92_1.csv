Blade Runner 2049," This is why people download movies.
","So freaking slow, the titanic sunk faster than this movies poor excuse for a plot, which anyone with a brain figured out in the first mind numbing hour. Harrison Ford was in the Force Awakens more than he was in this. Aside from some stunning visuals pleasing to the eye and fancy hi tech gadgets which try to lure you into thinking this might actually be a decent movie. It is a boring pile of crap. I very nearly walked out of the cinema. Lucky I like popcorn. Do not waste your time. This is why people download movies.",1,9,20,17 October 2017
