Changeling," just one of those movies that you never forget.. What if you were the mommy?
","Angie at Oscar level! (why Winslet got the oscar darn i dunno (!) ?)Beautiful scenes & dramatic 2 story-mix- mystery!Clint is one of THE best directors .. this proves! All of Clints movies are kinda weird, seem boring at first reading the plot... but when the tape starts rolling.... your'e hooked!Vague & creepy ! 2 stories told, looks somewhat shallow until you see the other part, then it feels like horror! Clint never shy's away from the story being freaky, unrealistic & abruptly, till kinda drained of satisfaction to finish .. It will leave u with more questions than answers.This is a movie decorates a situation so rare.. but what actually CAN happen if you are very, extremely unlucky. :(Angelina shows her quality traits, beyond her fragile haunting beauty.. acting is very very stunning! John Malcovich is the icing on the cake!Don't underestimate the cast of the female lead...( tomb raider - mainstream actress known for being pretty) ! this movie will stay with you for long!",Null,2,3,17 September 2013
Alien 3," Giving it a solid 9! This is why... its horror, sad and dark. Better of as a stand alone.
",I read all the reviews here and yes i agree its less perfect compared to the 1&2. But it still has a serious horror ( and still one of the best sci-fi) feelings of all films. Despite the damages due to director and budget issues.. this is still a very very good film. I love the simple brownish decay feeling its gives. I did care for some of the characters. Esp charles dance. I understand people are dissapointed if they expected a topping on James camerons Aliens. But try to see it without comparisations. And it will score mich higher. Also the film after this one one is very cool on itself. Please be more kind to these kind of films. Its very rare nowadays!! Sci-fi is not drowning in class acts. But this is actually one of the exeptions. Go see it also /or ecspecially if you didnt see the 1and 2nd film. Enjoy this dark claustrofobic sad movie! It will get its rates eventually.

It," Well done
","Had a blast!!! Let me start with a few negative points. Becos they were so unnecessary! I hope someone involved in this movie sees this ( prob not) but just in case. The massive amount of cgi- (headless body/ the leper dude/ George end scene/ fake maggots overload on the yelling etc) is making the movie loose the utterly frightening tick! Please stop that!! It isn't scary. The mummy/James wan style/the Langley's feeling is not needed,the clown itself is enough. Use a puppet ( Tim Henson) for god sake. ( the dark crystal monster puppets are more frightening) That is 'the' reason Tim Curry's Penny's made the world fear clowns forever. Cos it has A personality. A Lang- o- leer brainless critter with no message -only teeth is prob gonna face much more brave individuals with a shotgun ..Than a 7 ft tall intelligent demonic clown with rabies... or am i missing the point here? I was excited to see the movie. Tim Curry as Penny's was the only character ever that put fear and clowns in the same box. This new version by Bill does that as well. And i mean very well. But drop that cgi please. :-( (Spoilers again) The distant lurking/ pop up/unpredictable and violent movement of the clown is far more frightening. Example: The slaughterhouse at beginning, and the sudden penny in the grass scene .. those moments are short but disturbing. That makes me tick. Also the sewer chitchat, the friendly way Pennywise charms his victim & switches in a sec into a psychotic predator only by vibe. It feels nasty and scary. I would watch it right now again, cos its close to impossible to find a movie that makes me somewhat upset or teary. However bad the ending was ( Cgi overload) The way this frightening creature leaves the stage is not fear full and in line with the feeling the entity gave 2 hrs before. But that's my problem. If u like loudness, dominant fake-cgi, snakes grow out of mouth , giant bug-stuff. U would disagree. Last point: why, why give Penny this weird critter beak ( again massive cgi) it makes him loose all his game & less believable ..please!!! The distorting cgi face -morfing isn't scary! The clown itself and the violent moving limbs were enough. By all means, we are fed James wan style horror for the past yrs so i am giving this a 9 out of a 10! See this movie at all costs if you like good horror. Even tho the ending is weak. Those kids (except for the Stanley kid )were the best kids in cinema I've seen lately. I usually avoid all movies with kids. Loved: Ben (chubby kid). It made me seriously angry & i felt a sad discomfort due to what is done to him. Clown was ( against all odd's- Tim Curry was his predecessor) truly good. But give the guy dialog and face time....instead of cgi -Lang o leer-teeth ! No. Loved it cos its cruel,music & sound is beautiful. Richies humor, oh and the Georgie kid is extremely innocent and lovable. That works Sorry for some negativity- i feel that way be cos i liked the rest so muchPlease come back soon",Null,3,12,7 September 2017
Call Me by Your Name," One of the best films i've seen PERIOD!
","This is in no way a film about being gay. This teaches its audience whats its like to feel stunning love & lust. (being young) I love the integrity, reserved sexual scenery.. and still it feels so erotic. It's just filled with good people, their intentions towards one and another.... Just wonderful. 
I'm a gal and i'm not gay but i felt every emotion. I so fully understand. Both main characters are desirable, intelligent and beautiful people. 
Aside from the 'small' sensual fundament of this movie.. Pay attention to the professor and his wife.
The parents will give the audience some trust back in humanity. Wonderfully done.
I wish every person had such kind, intelligent and loving mom and dad. My parents were like this. I miss them. btw: i am buying the novel now!I love this movie so much! 
thank you",Null,1,5,11 January 2018
Joker," Sad, painful to watch at times. But very, very good. Perhaps the best?
","This is a very different/ perhaps disappointing movie for all those who seek simple-fast-action- slashing & superpowers. ( See some of the low ratings)
This movie is about real life sadness, fragility and coping with that. This is not a about the cold blooded super villain, (yet) The one who blows up buildings and burns you all. Oh and without machine guns or cgi fake stuff. But due to that the most dangerous of all.
This is a gritty psychological drama. I am hoping for an elaborate picture of this character.
This was exactly what the comic movie genre needed! A story of a kind man, whose life is ridden with sadness and bad luck. Instead of having superpowers or all the money in the world.
Its about coping, system flaws and realizing what may become of that.
Yes, we are all rooting for him now! Don't we?
I Loved Arthur and this is one of the better movies i have seen in past years. Please bring more of this.
Well done !",Null,1,1,7 October 2019
It Chapter Two," Why why why all that CGI??
","I left the cinema. The first 10 min were oke. And it become watching the walking dead. Zombies, zombies slimy eyeballs .. come one. Stop the cgi! It is not scary. Oh Btw Bill the Clown is fantastic. God you should have given him more screen time .. not boring fake lame zombies. I dont understand mcvoy and that gorgeous woman are happy to be a movie about mainly cgi zombies. Bah",Null,0,0,8 September 2019
Prometheus," Drop the exp. for topping Aliens please! This is pure class horror in space!!
","This film is by far one of my favourite films ever. And my second fav. to Alien& Aliens!! I do not understand the score-1 reviews and the unfair hatefulness. Yes its diff. than the first 2. 
So, still this film is a masterpiece in every form. Stop the utter-unfair revs for Ripley's sake!
I tend to feel for aliens/god's, questionary subjects like this. Since most people do not and deny all & everything that is not in old books. Its somewhat clear to me. But no just stop the bullies crap! The colours, actors, shots, sounds and pacing are perfect. Period. 
I do find the 'convenant' far less smart. covenant is very brutal but lacks much depth. This film does not!! Its beautiful in every way! Again; Its in my top 3 films of all films I've seen. Thats partly due to the lack of quality in all existing horror and Sci-Fi movies. But i actually have seen it more than the aliens... cos it pleasant to see to hear and its above all prob the hardest job in the world! Making a better Aliens movie.... Please for god sake!!!! I somewhat understand this movie wasn't in everyone's expectations. I think most peeps wanted it to be topping the already ( close to perfect 2 alien movies) i think you do not miss the point, but simply might not be able to respect quality. I do pardon my unkindness. 
Yes, Prometheus is far from the old much loved epic -alien series. But its a fantastic piece of film. Please part from the narrow mind like-approach and see this as a stand alone. I give it a solid 12!!!!!",Null,3,5,4 April 2018
