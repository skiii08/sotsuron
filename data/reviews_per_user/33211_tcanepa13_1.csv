Marie Antoinette," Pretty to look at, Not much Else
","I really wish that Ms. Coppola would figure out that there needs to be a plot to drive a film. I think this film is very reflective of its main character, pretty to look at with no substance whatsoever. My thought about 'Lost in Translation' was that the film would not even have been watchable without Bill Murray and his dry comic touches. Well, this film did not have Bill Murray.I'm sure she will be praised for her Sex Pistols-like titles and her use of rock and punk music in a period piece. But the thing is, it's been done before, and done better. 'A Knight's Tale' did it fairly recently and to a much better effect. I think Coppola also struggles with her father's problem with cutting things out (Apocalypes Now:Redux). I think if this film was (at least) 30 minutes shorter it might have at least had a chance at being a semi-enjoyable time at the movies.Character pieces without character don't do much for me. At least her cinematographer will be able to find work in the future.",3,2,5,21 October 2006
