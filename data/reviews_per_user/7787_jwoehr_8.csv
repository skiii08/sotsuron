The Longest Yard," Fun with a good cast
","I never saw the original but I really liked this movie anyway. I usually don't like Adam Sandler comedies this much. I like Sandler but I think he chews scenery too much in most his movies. Plus they all have the 'YOU CAN DO IT!!' plot. He has to go against all the odds with everyone rooting for him by the end. Sure the Longest Yard isn't that much different than his usual movies. Still it's funner and for once it's just not only about Sandler's character. Richard Roeper totally tore the movie apart. He said that Chris Rock is in another forgettable role. He's just picking on him due to Rock's comments on Jude Law at the Oscars's though. I'm not the biggest Rock fan and didn't like those comments either. However he does shine here and does have the best lines. I also like the wrestlers in the film that star in supporting roles. You have Kevin Nash as a prison guard who gets his steroids replaced with estrogen. He's pretty funny in the movie, he doesn't have the potential of the Rock. Still scenes like where he asks the other guards why his nipples are so hard are pretty funny. Goldberg is funny as a prisoner who's nickname for his private part is 'the Sledgehammer'. Stone Cold Steve Austin also stars as a prejudice prison guard. He doesn't get as much to do as Nash and Goldberg. The WWE was promoting the movie by mentioning just Austin and talking about his potential as an actor. If there's potential you don't get to see it that much in this movie. Sandler got knocked by Roeper for not being believable as a football player. I think he's much more believable here as one than in the Waterboy though. Plus quarterbacks don't have to be that big. I mean Jamie Fox isn't the biggest guy either and he played a quarterback in Any Given Sunday. I think Sandler pulls off the role fine. This is his best comedy I think. I can't count how many times I laughed. Most football comedies think they need a bar fight in-order to be funny. In the Longest Yard at least there's no bar for them to have a big brawl in.",6,1,3,9 July 2005
Batman Begins," Now that's a Batman movie!
","It's funny how Warner Brother's didn't want Tim Burton back for the 3rd movie since he made the movies too dark. Yet Batman Begins is probably the darkest and most serious of all. I guess Warner Brother's learned that darker is better than goofy and overly colorful since Batman Forever and Batman & Robin. This is the best since Tim Burton's films and what a Batman film should be like. Christopher Nolan gives the film a human touch and makes it more about Bruce Wayne and his feelings than about the villains. The other movies sorta just made Bruce Wayne/Batman a side character to the villains. Speaking of the villains Nolan takes them seriously. They don't prance around saying silly lines in this one. Plus I also doubt Nolan is ever gonna focus on shots of Batman's butt like Joel Schumacher did. He takes everything about it seriously. Maybe too serious though since it could use to lighten up just a little a bit. Besides having a problem with that. I don't like how Batman talks while in the costume though. I found it a little silly how deep and monster like his voice sounds. Also Roger Ebert acts like the whole poison gas thing is 100% original for a villain to do in a Batman movie. The Joker did that in the first movie. I do like how this gas puts fear into people though. The gas in the original just made people die with goofy smiles on their faces. The Scare Crow (Cillain Murphy) is what a villain should be like. He doesn't burp and say 'was that over the top ? I never can tell', he's 100% serious. Cillain Murphy from 28 Days Later does a fine job playing him too. The other villains are well played also and don't goof around what so ever. Christian Bale makes a great Batman and the best since Michael Keaton. He has a lot of inner-demons to fight in the movie. He first thinks he needs to kill the man that killed his parents. When he tells his childhood friend Rachel (Katie Holmes) his plan. She slaps him and says 'your dad would be ashamed'. So he runs away from Gotham City and meets Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson). Ducard trains Bruce how to be a ninja and how to control his fears. When Bruce discovers that Ducard and Ra's Al Ghil (Ken Watanbe) have evil plans for Gotham City he decides that's not the sort of man he is. He then goes back to Gotham City. There he turns a tunnel he discovered as a kid into...the batcave. Then he gets all sorts of gadgets 'including the batmobile' from a loyal Wayne employee Lucius Fox (Moragn Freeman). He decides to dress like a bat since bats were always his fear. So he decides to use his fear as a weapon. It's nice to the see the actual transformation he makes to Batman in this one. That was never seen in the other films. We see him use all those gadgets in the other films but never had a clue how he got them. I always doubted he made all of them on his own. So the Lucius Fox character is a nice touch. Plus with Ducard we also know that Batman didn't just train himself to fight. There's just so many characters to mention in this film. Nolan actually fits in a nice amount of screen time for them too. Rutger Hauer gets to make the best out of a small part. He is the type of actor who can make a small part seem like a bigger one. That's how good of an actor he is. He plays the not so nice guy who takes over the Wayne business after Bruce's dad is killed. He told Bruce when he was little that he could have the business when he is ready. Which is a lie because he's not that eager to give up the job. I expected some crazy employee to kill Haurer. I mean look at the other films. It isn't one where a villain doesn't kill his or her boss lol. Gary Oldman also shines as Lt. Gordon who is the only cop who trusts and befriends batman. I'd rather just see more of them teaming up than Robin or Batgirl ever being introduced again. Batman is much better without them. Batman is also much better without...Joel Schumacher lol.",9,0,0,9 July 2005
X-Men: The Last Stand," A Summer Movie that's tons of fun but that's about all it is
","X-3 is without Brian Singer but Brett Ratner (Red Dragon, Rush Hour 1 and 2) at least stays faithful to the original movies. I'm not sure if all comic fans will jump for joy after seeing the movie though. The movies never fully become what they could've been. It would seem that this one ends things before the series could fully develop into the great stuff the comics and even the 1990's cartoon series gave us. Still though with so much great action and fun special effects it's pretty hard to call this a bad movie. It may not be the ending fans want but is it bad ending ? No. In this film, the father of Angel (Ben Foster) wants a normal life for his son who just happens to be a mutant with Angel wings. So he finds a cure but not all mutants want the cure. Magneto of course is strongly against it and plans on raging war against humans and killing the boy who's the source of the cure. While Jean Grey is back as Phoenix but without yelling 'I am PHOENIX!!' like you may remember from the cartoon series lol. Here she just stands there thinking about what her next move will be. While Wolverine trys to get through to her. It's hard though since Magneto has a strong influence on her. Ratner offers many new bad mutants but...they are hardly developed. Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones) for example isn't related to Charles Xavier at all in this movie and yes he has some great fight scenes but it's still sorta disappointing how he's used. I expected a fight between him and Colossus but that never happens here. I do like how he throws Wolverine around though and how he chases Kitty Pride around as she literly runs through walls as he just rams them down after her. The best way for the ultimate X-Men fan to enjoy this movie is to not expect a movie that's a faithful ending but at least expect a good summer movie. With so many people hating on the Da Vinci Code they'll probably be more satisfied and entertained by seeing this movie. This is a fitting end for the movies since it fits in with the tone of the other movies. But since I loved the cartoon series there's so many other directions they could've gone. Now even if this isn't the last one, I don't know how they could pick themselves up and make more. Since Hugh Jackman does kick ass Wolverine though, I do see how they could make a lot of money at least making Wolverine movies. Cyclops though got the worse end of the deal with these movies since they were never interested in developing him.",7,0,1,26 May 2006
The Da Vinci Code," Engaging and Interesting...FICTION!!!
","I have seen so many bad * 1/2 and even one star reviews for this movie and the only review that got things right is the **** review I saw by the New York Post. Once I saw that **** review I thought many other reviews like that would follow. However I guess everyone else that gave it bad reviews are either overly Christian or have short attenion spans. Since some either complain about the length or the story itself. I even heard something about over-acting. Funny, I don't recall much over-acting here. There's also reviews about it be boring with too much talking. Sure it's convenient that they can get out every single thing they wanna say about history unknown to mankind before they are in danger again. However the book was like that too. Plus I didn't find all the talking boring. It' is faithful to the book and if everything the book says wasn't explained, the people watching the film that didn't read the book would be lost. Besides listening to Ian McKellen talk in any movie isn't boring and of course it's not boring here either. Everything he says about Jesus may be silly and offending to some but....IT's FICTION!. People can be like 'oh no, tell me he didn't just say that'. When what is really so bad about what is being said ? I think it's selfish to just want to think that Jesus possibly couldn't of had a wife and kids and to totally be appalled by the thought. It doesn't make him any less special to me if it's true. Besides like I said...this is FICTION!, so hating the book and now the movie is the real silly thing. I think everyone that gave this bad reviews had it planned to hate it in the first place. Yes the screenplay is done by Akiva Goldsman who wrote the screenplay for Batman & Robin. So of course critics had to throw that in there and say the movie sucks because of that too. I too expected the film to suck once I learned that but come on, there's no Batman & Robin like dialogue in this film. Of course the guy that wrote Batman & Robin isn't as good of a writer as Dan Brown but he doesn't do a bad job bringing Brown's work to the big screen either. If you're mad that he chose to have all the talking from the book then that's silly too. The main characters are supposed to be talkers and brainy debaters. While the actors play them how they should be played. This is a movie where you are supposed open your mind and heart and just think a little. If you want a non-stop action summer movie, this isn't it but is it a bad summer movie ? No not at all. Is it a bad adaption of the Da Vinci Code ? No, it's everything it should be and Ron Howard is very faithful to the book and so are the actors. Newsday also called the film over-scored by Hans Zimmer , I couldn't disagree more. The score is wonderful and if the film wasn't soooo unfairly hated it would get a best score nomination like it deserves. This is probably Ron Howards most unfairly hated film since Willow. While reading the book, the ending didn't do much for me but actually seeing it yourself, it's just beautiful and breathtaking and I loved it. So just give this film a chance and don't think it's your job of being a Christian to hate the film, just open your mind and sit back and relax.",7,2,4,21 May 2006
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," This was great fun
",Mr. and Mr.s Smith is about a married couple 'Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie' who are bored with their marriage. When they discover that each other are spies but for the opposite side their marriage gets a lot more exciting. They start trying to kill each other but it's really just a game for both of them. They don't really wanna kill each other. They're having too much fun and it's hard for the audience not to have fun as well. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are excellent and pull off their parts extremely well. Plus they have great chemistry as well. The movie just falls apart at the end a little. They argue and talk about their marriage during shoot-outs which can be annoying after awhile. Plus the shoot- outs can last too long and not be very believable. I also think the end is flat and uneventful. The movie just ends after a shoot-out that's not that involving or believable. The movie really really needed a main villain. The movie is just about their marriage though and I guess it would've lost focus a little if their was a main villain. Still though it needed something besides them just killing soldier after soldier that come after them. The movie could've used more of Vince Vaughn who steals the show every time he's on screen which isn't enough. He plays a loyal friend to Pitt who doesn't trust any women but his mother. He even lives with her. I was hoping he would even get some action in the movie but that never happens. Still though Pitt and Jolie do their best work in awhile and carry the movie fine. I feel sorry for Jennifer Anisten who was sooo in love with Pitt. However I can see how Pitt and Jolie fell in love making this movie. It would be hard to believe if they didn't with such strong chemistry.,7,0,2,9 July 2005
War of the Worlds," It will take your breath away!
","War of the Worlds is one of the most breathtaking movies I've ever seen. Once it starts it takes you and never lets go. The attack on the city is done in a more realistic way than ID4. Spielberg always wanted to make a War of the Worlds movie and this is a remake that's actually extremely good. It's about a construction worker (Tom Cruise), who gets his kids for a weekend. After a huge lightning storm Cruise goes outside to check up on things. Him and some neighbors examine a hole in the street until suddenly it starts getting bigger and bigger. Then that's when the alien ships start coming from under ground. They start out by blowing up some people while Cruise and many others run in horror. Cruise goes back to his kids in shock and starts packing things. Then he steals a neighbors truck because he realizes an even bigger attack is just moments away. Although Tom Cruise is a bit nuts these days he's still one of the best actors around. Although the attacks and the aliens are more of the star than him, he still gives a great performance. Dakota Fanning (Man on Fire) is equally good as his daughter. Tim Robbins (Mystic River) as a nut with a shot gun who takes Cruise and Fanning into hiding steals the show in a small part. The movie never lets up. When you think it's taking a break from attacks, there's another scene full of tension and then another and another. I think this is Spielberg's most terrifying ride, even more so than Jurassic Park and Jaws. When the movie was over barely anyone talked or could move. It just takes so much out of you. It's haunting, gripping, emotional and just well done. It does have a problem or 2 though. Like for instance, the narration in the beginning and end from Morgan Freeman isn't needed. It takes away from the realistic nature of the film. We don't need the stapled on explanation at the end to why this or that happened. It just seems like something from the Twilight Zone. Otherwise I think War of the Worlds is one of the years best so far, next to Batman Begins and Sin City anyway.",8,0,2,9 July 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The Best of the Prequels by far
","StarWars: Revenge of the Sith is one of the best StarWars movies. When I saw Attack of the Clones I thought that was the best next to The Empire Strikes Back. I thought that was Lucas showing he can still do StarWars. No though, Revenge of the Sith is a real StarWars movie. It still has George Lucas' bad dialogue of course. There's more action than there is talking though thank god. When you think of it though, A New Hope didn't have the best dialogue either. Although the late great Alec Guinness was nominated for playing Obi-Wan, it's said that he hated the lines he had to say. Hey at least he had better lines than Natalie Portman does. Anyway there's tons and tons of action and Lucas' pacing isn't that bad this time around. I mean in Phantom Menace, it had it's lame moments when there was huge scenes of just dialogue and no action. The weakest parts are when Anakin (Hayden Christensen) and Padmé (Natalie Portman) express their love to each other but at least those scenes are short. Hearing lines like 'hold me like you did in Naboo', will make you cringe but they aren't enough to ruin the movie. Hayden Christensen's scenes with Ian McDiarmid 'The Emperor/ Palpatine' are far better. He seduces Anakin to the darkside cleverly. He feeds his ego by calling him the best and saying it's a pity how the Jedi hold him back. Also he tells him that powers of the dark side will save Padme since Anakin fears her death. This is the only StarWars prequel to my knowledge that people in the audience actually applauded to more than once while watching. They loved Yoda's action scenes as did I. Everyone seemed to be entertained more during Yoda's fight with the Emperor than the Anakin/Obi-Wan fight as well. I think that is the most enertaining fight. Obi-Wan's fight with General Grievous is very well done as well. Grievous holds the Lightsabers of Jedis he killed and fights Obi- Wan with 4 at a time at one point. Anakin's fight with Count Dooku isn't bad as well. The look on Dooku's face when Palpatine tells Anakin to kill him is priceless. Lucas is good at structuring a script 'even if he can't write dialogue for his life' and he does his best job here. He fits everything in there well. He answers almost every question you may ask. Like for example why doesn't 3-3P0 tell Luke in a New Hope that he knew his father ? He also made this the most violent and darkest of the six films. There's scenes with kid Jedis even getting killed. There's also some limbs getting cutting off from time to time. Still though it was obvious even long before this movie came out that it would be dark. I mean Anakin becomes Darth Vader and you know all the Jedis but Obi-Wan and Yoda will die. Revenge of the Sith fills in the final gap of the StarWars trilogy and it's done very well. This is a prequel that doesn't disappoint, it's exciting and not lame and is actually worth waiting on line for days and days for.",7,1,2,20 May 2005
Fantastic Four," What movie did Roger Ebert see ?
","I was gonna listen to the bad reviews and not see this movie. That would've been a big mistake though. Ebert gave it one star and called the 5 main characters idiots for what they attempt in outta space. Well scientists are always planning on doing something far fetched in movies that don't make sense. Here it just sets up for them to get their powers. Plus Ebert loved Batman Begins and just was way way too hard on this movie because he thinks people should see that instead. Well Batman already made a lot of money. Now is Fantastic Four's turn. I've known people who said Batman Begins was boring. I loved it but this movie is more fun and has a lot more humor. I don't think people will be disappointed in it after seeing Batman at all. Yes that is what a Batman movie should be like and Fanastic Four is...what a Fantastic Four movie should be like. I've seen cartoon shows and this is exactly what it was like. So yes the whole lets go in space and do this and that is a flat idea. From what I know though, it came straight from the comics. It doesn't hold the movie back though. It's still a great comic adaption and a stronger one than Eleckra, Daredevil, Punisher and The Hulk. It has it's silly moments but still they don't take away from how enjoyable this movie is. I thought the cast does a fine job making their characters work. Ioan Gruffudd (King Arthur) fairs well as Reed Richards who gets stretching powers. Each power they get fits their personality. He's a dreamer and always reaching for the stars so that's why he got that ability. Jessica Alba (SinCity) as Susan Storm does OK too as Richards' former g/f who feels invisible compared to his love for science. So she gets invisible powers. Chris Evans (Cellular) as Johny Storm is hilarious as a young pilot hotshot with a flaming ego. So he gets powers where he literally goes on fire. Michael Chiklis (The Shield) steals the show as well as Ben Grimm. He's Reed's bestfriend and protector. So since he's seen as being like a rock, he turns into a big rock guy. He loses his wife due to how he looks now. Plus the whole world stares at him. So he has the most trouble accepting his new powers since unlike the others he can't turn them on and off. Julian McMahon (Nip/Tuck, Charmed) plays Victor Von Doom who funded their mission to space. He also is on the ship and gets some powers as well. His start turning him steal and give him powers to shoot electric bolts. Like Johny Storm, he embraces his powers the most. Storm though just wants to show them off. Victor though wants to use them to kill whoever pisses him off and to rule. McMahon plays him well too and does a fine job crossing over from TV to film. When I saw that the movie was getting bad reviews I figured it was due to Tim Story's direction. He also did that dud Taxi. However I think he handles the action and everything fine. So I think one star is very very hard on this film. It's tons of fun with funny one-liners, especially from Chris Evans. Plus when the four of them don't get along and use their powers against each other, it's just great fun. Especially when Grimm gets mad at Johny Storm for nick naming him the Thing in front of millions of people. When those two exchange words or get ready to fight, it's just good stuff. Chiklis really is the Thing and pulls off the part fantastic! Should this movie be dismissed with one star ? Hell no! I think it's just as entertaining as the Spiderman movies. So take a chance like me and go see it. Expect something awful and you're gonna have a blast.",7,4,8,9 July 2005
