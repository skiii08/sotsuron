Scarface," Sing when your losing! Spoilers.
","Lately I've felt drawn to long violent epics dealing with crime (Once Upon a Time in America, The Godfather, Goodfellas). Even though I don't think Scarface holds up to those movies I still think it succeeds at a level where the Howard Hawks movie didn't. I can't think of another person who could of played this role better than Al Pacino, and yes, that does include Paul Muni. I don't think it's a coincidence that the filmmakers chose the same person who played Michael Corleone. Both characters are bad, use violence for personal gain, and are incredibly human. Maybe it strays away in the famous final scene when Tony Montana is riddled by a swarm of bullets, not to mention the scene where a stoned-out Pacino inhales a mountain of cocaine on his desk. Still, Tony Montana is one of those characters that stays with you despite the fact that he's a monster that would kill a person at the drop of a hat, and drop the hat himself. The violence in Scarface is not there to entertain, but as a way to reinforce the self-destruction of Montana; so when it does get to that point where you see a crowd of people overwhelm Montana's mansion, you know that there's no way he's going to get out of this one. I'm not really use to seeing DePalma's work outside of his well-known thriller movies like Dressed to Kill and Sisters. Still, He's a master at building up suspense.",1,15,34,6 July 2002
Requiem for a Dream," An important statement on the quick decline
","REQUIEM FOR A DREAM is such an important film that no award or accolade can justly honor the people who have put so much into its making. I was so profoundly affected by this movie that I doubt I will see a more important film to come out this year. I will not say much on the plot only because I think many of the user comments have already referred to it. Nevertheless, I think certain aspects of the plot in REQUIEM should be commented on. Primarily, I like how the movie speaks of a greater tragedy. Rather than limiting the movie's theme to an anti-drug message REQUIEM FOR A DREAM shows how addictions (be it drugs, television, etc...) shatter dreams and goals. The ability to create something good, anything good, is one of the greatest gifts a person can possess. When we reduce our lives to the rituals of addiction, and its destructive results, we destroy our capacity to create better lives for ourselves. In this film we see so much potential for these people to have something better. Their quick decline results in some of the best acting ever committed to celluloid. Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans and Jennifer Connelly all give career-best performances. I have seen very few movies that have actually made me think seriously about my own life. I can honestly say that I think this film has made me a better person and I would like others to benefit from this movie as well. One of the best statements on the quick decline.",10,0,0,10 November 2000
The Birth of a Nation," D.W. Griffith: White Racist?
","Let's see, after seeing Griffith's INTOLERANCE, a movie where a woman's movement is compared to religious Pharisees and reading about a movie like BROKEN BLOSSOMS, where the lead male character is referred to by a derogatory nick-name, I decided to give BIRTH OF A NATION a look. I am not even done with this film because it has sparked too much anger and disgust in me to finish it. It is the most blatantly prejudiced film I have ever seen. Many of the people who have defended this film in their user comments correctly state that even the best westerns contain some prejudices. I can even overlook INTOLERANCE's minor shortcomings in light of its brilliant 4-story structure and technical expertise. Likewise, BIRTH OF A NATION is beautifully photographed and there are some scenes that are fascinating to watch. Nevertheless, from the standpoint of a novice viewer to Griffith's work, my impression is that Griffith is way too pre-occupied in portraying blacks as racist, violent, lazy, and conspiratory in the second half. BIRTH OF A NATION not only does this, it doesn't hint (except maybe with the exception of it's opening scene), that people suffered because of slavery. Kind of biased for a film placed within the context of The Civil War. A film like this only makes me question Griffith's intent. Griffith later went on to make possibly the first interracial love story in the movies (BROKEN BLOSSOMS) possibly to make amends from my very criticism of BIRTH OF A NATION. Aside from it's technical aspects, I can only view BIRTH OF A NATION in the same way I view Leni Riefenstahl's TRIUMPH OF THE WILL: technically fascinating, but blatantly propagandist.",4,3,8,13 December 2001
Mulholland Drive," The cinematic equivalent of Finnegans Wake
","Mulholland Drive is the cinematic equivalent of Finnegans Wake, not just because Lynch created a film that transcends most typical cinematic conventions, but because he seems to have created an entirely new genre all to itself. Mulholland Drive is a puzzle within a puzzle, it has no plot, no beginning, no end, no overall theme, no structure. And yet it has enough structure for any person to have a rough idea of what's going on, granted if one looked closer. It's as if, and you know this can be taken literally, Lynch took his entire television series, cut random reels, put them in a box, and randomly edited one reel with the next. A lot of people have a problem with Mulholland Drive for the very fact that it was intended for T.V. According to their logic, how can you praise a film that came from a television series, when it never premiered on...well...television. I say, why not? The Hollywood of Mulholland Drive seems to have more in common with their criticisms then they would care to admit. In Lynch's movie, the film industry turns out careless bubble gum entertainment, while the industry itself is controlled by a closed society where all of the artistic decisions are pre-arranged, and sometimes by coercive means. If only more artists could learn from Lynch's example. No wonder Mulholland drive never made it to television, it's too good for a medium where every other show involves a court case, a 'reality theme', or family foibles. I say why a court drama? Why not a film about the context of their dreams? In essence, Lynch hasn't created a film about film, Mulholland Drive...is film itself.",10,3,4,29 July 2002
Hedwig and the Angry Inch," I'm a Hed Head!
","A couple of nights ago I saw John Cameron Mitchell's screen version of his off-Broadway hit 'Hedwig and the Angry Inch'. It is one of the great movie experiences in this lackluster year of film. This year... it seems like nothing but sequels. Likewise, there are very few independent and foreign films I have happened to be satisfied with as well. HATAI is the first film to come out this year that I've been completely satisfied with. Interestingly, I came into the theater expecting some kind of rock music parody a la Spinal Tap. What I got was much, much more. Not only is HATAI a fun movie to watch, I think is does a great job dealing with themes like self discovery and finding wholeness within oneself. That's why the Berlin Wall plays such an important role throughout this film. The music is incredibly effective and well done. In fact, at the screening I attended, many people were singing along with the songs during the film. I really think that the music will leave just as big of a lasting impression on some audiences as the movie itself. Nevertheless, a lot of people will be scratching their heads when they see the ending. Personally, I was quite satisfied with it because it doesn't reduce Hedwig's arch-rival (Tommy Gnosis) to some kind of nemesis. Rather, in one stunning sequence in the film we see how both are similar to each other. I hope everyone on the IMDB gets at a chance to see this smart, innovative film. I appreciated it greatly.",10,0,2,21 September 2001
2001: A Space Odyssey," Possibly the greatest artistic achievement of this century
","Not only is 2001: A Space Odyssey possibly the greatest film of the 20th Century, it may well be considered the greatest artistic achievement of this century as well. There has never been a film that has sparked the imagination quite like Kubrick's 1968 masterpiece. He used elements found in art house films up to the time he stared to direct 2001 and made them more commercial. 2001: A Space Odyssey is indeed a definitive mark in both film and science fiction, simultaneously reinforcing in the minds of the audience of what film is and rewriting the rules of filmmaking in general. In essence, Kubrick created a new standard of filmmaking found only within his own unorthodox approach. Some have criticized 2001, as being tedious, boring, dumb, etc. In reality, 2001, unlike most sci-fi before it, makes its own - less obvious - statement concerning Mankind's relationship with God and the Universe. The people of 2001 are just what their technology has made them. The apparent dullness of the future is only magnified by the way the humans interact with each other. One gets the sense that these people have reduced space travel to something that is uninteresting and, in fact, boring. This is necessary in order to show how the humans have become so much like the machines. That is why the relationship between the crew of the Discovery spacecraft and HAL 9000 is such an important part of the movie. This all culminates in the haunting final scenes which may show that despite mankind's successes with technology, man still has much to learn. It is no surprise that Kubrick's style of filmmaking is not as appealing as that of other directors. It's not supposed to. His films are intended to make the audience do one thing that many of today's modern films do not permit them to do, and that is think. As a result, Kubrick's style has resulted in one of the most loyal followings around one single director in this century.",10,1,5,10 December 1999
A Beautiful Mind," Crowe rises above genre, the movie doesn't. Spoilers.
","A BEAUTIFUL MIND is the story of how a talented man, bound by a desire to put his craft to work, attempted to defeat disability, and went on to receive praise from his contemporaries. You might think that I have successfully described the trials of the Russell Crowe character (John Nash) in the film, and how, with the help of his wife, handled schizophrenia while going on the win the Nobel Prize. The problem is, I didn't. This really isn't the plot of the movie. In fact, the plot of this film involves what went on behind the scenes of the movie.We live in a time where Hollywood cannot even make a decent character study without placing it in some predefined genre with the intent of increasing box office revenue. I couldn't help but consider this while watching A BEAUTIFUL MIND. That's not to say I didn't feel satisfied with Russell Crowe's performance. To put it bluntly, this is some of the best acting you will ever see. Unfortunately, A BEAUTIFUL MIND becomes a psychological thriller that leads to a pithy resolution that 'love conquers all'.
I can only suspect that this was not the film that Ron Howard wanted to make. Don't get me wrong, I've never identified Howard as being some kind of independent spirit or unconventional filmmaker. After all, Howard did direct THE GRINCH. But here is why what went behind the scenes overshadows the story: Howard does put a lot of emphasis on character development, and I could sense his desire to give John Nash's story full emphasis with a studio pressuring him to make a thriller. As a result, the film is kind of half-baked. We become more concerned with whether John Nash is delusional or not. At least, I was.I still recommend A BEAUTIFUL MIND. Crowe's performance is the reason to see it, along with praiseworthy performances by Ed Harris, Adam Goldberg, and Christopher Plummer. This was also one of the few times I've went to see a film where the audience applauded at the end. I can't help but praise an action star like Russell Crowe for transcending the Hollywood genre. I wish I could say the same for the movie itself.",10,0,1,27 December 2001
The Godfather," I cried. Definite Spoilers.
","MARIO PUZO'S THE GODFATHER (that is the full name of the film) is haunting, gothic, thought-provoking and an excellent sociological study. On the surface, this is a story about organized crime, loyalty, and family. On the subsurface, Coppola weaves brilliant themes about parallel identities and the profound influence of example. In essence, THE GODFATHER isn't a gangster film; it is too intricate and genuine of a film to be characterized as simply a `gangster film'. Much of the importance of the movie lies in the actual character of the Godfather. Marlon Brando's Godfather seems to represent an individual who is world-weary, but yet, not disillusioned to the point of extending loyalty to others. We look at THE GODFATHER from the standpoint of an individual on the outside looking in. Even though the opening scenes take place in the midst of a wedding, this is a closed society to us. Criminals and cold-blooded killers dance, sing, and play with all the innocence of children. And yet, we want to be close to many of these people once the movie ends. When an undertaker named Amerigo Bonasera asks the Godfather to perform a service for him the patriarch reminds him of the fact that Bonasera never 'wanted his friendship' and that he couldn't remember the last time he was invited over for a 'cup of coffee'. We may relate to the many times that we, like Don Corleone, extended our friendship and loyalty to others but never got it in return. I know too many people that are more concerned with having someone else do something for them than returning any sort of favor. It's amazing that as powerful of a figure the Godfather is, he also looks at the small acts that characterize friendship. I began to relate to him so much I began to wish that all fathers could retain many of the beautiful characteristics that this man possesses. This is not to deify the character lead of Coppola's film. After all, the Godfather is a criminal. And yet, when he dies in the film, it's as if the World has suffered a great loss. I actually cried during this scene the first time I saw it when I was a kid. It is interesting to note that we are not supposed to respect the criminal organization in this film. After all, the extent to which a person is protected in the Don's extended criminal family is often related to the extent to which a character is willing to shed blood. A good member must be willing to break the law and deny one's friends but never their family. In essence, the movie is filled with paradoxes (not in plot, but in the characters themselves). We see a grandfatherly figure that pulls the strings of a criminal organization. We witness the transformation of the good son to the calculating killer. We see benevolence in many of the supporting characters that are willing to kill. THE GODFATHER is a movie that is more complicated and intricate than people are willing to admit. As a result, at our access is one of the most fascinating character studies.",10,0,1,16 December 2000
