The Avengers," My take on the first big superhero movie of the summer
","I really loved the avengers it was the best marvel movie that I've seen in years and I've seen a lot of them and it was funny now usually superhero movies aren't as funny as other movies they are usually very dramatic and normally one of the main characters in the movie die. Well this movie has a little bit of both it's very funny and a main character did indeed die, now I won't give away who dies but will say that it won't be a surprise when you see it. The movie had great action scenes their was a great fight between iron man and Thor, and captain America and an absolutely awesome fight scene with Thor facing off with the hulk they tore up shield fighting each other I mean you will go crazy when you see it. Loki was also very evil his intentions are to take over the world and you want him to lose so bad and he does in the end but you will definitely see and admire the evil in him and you will not be disappointed at all particularly with the scene where the black widow is talking to Loki while he is in the cell inside shield the evilness in his voice will scare you to your core he also does a good job controlling his alien army who are the ultimate adversaries for the avengers and the ultimate threat to the entire planet. But anyway the movie was great the heroes each played their part iron man/ Tony stark was a great leader and made the ultimate sacrifice at the end of the film captain America also had great leadership qualities and has adjusted to the new world he is in quite well and Thor helps with his lightning power and strength without which the avengers never would have survived he knew who the aliens were and that he had to stop his brother Loki at all costs the hulk was great too and did a lot of hulk smashing and smashed a few of the alien ships which was very helpful indeed. All and all the cast was perfect and Joss Whedon crafted an amazing film that will be enjoyed by geeks everywhere for years to come.",Null,2,6,7 May 2012
Men in Black 3," My take on the latest installment of the men in black series
",If you're looking for a film to put you in high spirits for the summer movie season than you're going to like but at the same time be a little disappointed in this particular film. Josh Brolin steals the movie playing an absolute clone of agent K he plays a likable but boring guy living in the 60s. Agent J has the typical one liner jokes that would be funny if will smith had cracked them in a fresh prince of be-lair episode but now many of them just roll off as being a little lame some of them are funny but most are second class in nature. The Villain Boris the animal is lethal and dangerous but not in enough of the movie to make people care about him he and K have a history K arrested him in 1969 for a multiple number of murders and created a net that stopped his kind from getting to earth but he breaks out of a prison on the moon and has a disgusting spiked organism that comes out of his hand and only he can speak to. The two agents have to find the being who has the net to keep the aliens out of earth by stopping Boris from getting it and killing K their is a great battle in the climax involving Americas first ever launch to the moon. The end is the best part it's a great ending and like Barry son field said in an interview 'it's very emotional' but don't worry I spoil it but I will say this movie series should end a trilogy. All and all you should go to this film if you loved the first two men in black films you'll love this film dark knight951 out.,7,1,4,5 June 2012
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Sherlock Holmes battles the nefarious professor Moriarty a criminal mastermind in this sequel to the hit 2009 Sherlock Holmes movie
",First of all I'll start off by saying that despite how good the movie was I still enjoyed the first movie more than this one. I thought that the movie was very funny it had another great performance from Robert Downey JR. I thought Rachel McAdams did a good job with what time she had in the movie oh by the way her character Irene Adler dies ten minutes into the movie Moriarty kills her by giving her tuberculosis. I really thought that Noomi Rapace did a good job this being her first American movie and all but her character Simza's only significance to the story is that Moriaty is trying and eventually succeeds in killing her brother. I thought Stephen Frye as Sherlock's brother was hilarious particularly the scene where he's naked while talking to Watson's bride. Jared Harris did a pretty Good job as professor James Moraity although I would have liked to see more of him in the movie I thought his take was good he played a very smart and keen version of Moriarty who has other people do his dirty work for him and who is ultimately outwitted by Sherlock at the end of the film. Jude law's take this time around was a bit different in that he grows more and more tiresome of Holmes during the duration of the film but still helps him non the less John Watson is dragged into the battle whiskey Moriarty when he goes after him and tries to have Watson and his wife Mary killed on a train on their way to their honeymoon he also grows more remorseful for Holmes during the movie although he does save him at the end of the movie. Robert Downey JR. like I said just really nailed the role of Sherlock Holmes the funniest parts of the entire movie are at the begging and end of the movie when he's dressed up in camouflage but to me the greatest improvement is his mind he is a lot smarter than he was in the first movie I still love that he projects how he is going to beat someone up before he does it and then does it flawlessly and exactly how he rehearsed it in his head I also loved the way that he outsmarted Moriarty because it was more of a challenge for him than in the first movie the fact that he had to let Moriarty torture him by hanging him on a fishhook and then stealing a little red book that had all of Moriarty's plans and investments in it and making him bankrupt in the process a I am not going to say much about the ending but trust me you are going to get your money's worth it's a great ending I just ca't give it away. in closing I think Sherlock Holmes a game of shadows is a very fun ride a very intense and thrilling edge of your seat adventure movie.,7,1,6,17 December 2011
Ted," My take on the truly dirtiest Teddy bear movie you'll ever see in your life
",Ted was absolutely breathtaking and the funniest movie I've seen in years the story was great and Seth macfarlane just has a touch for comedy that few actors/directors have in Hollywood today the jokes were funny the fight scene was the best part of the movie the full fight the trailer is great showing the fight and all but it does it no justice the movie is so much better with the fight and it's just funny as hell and even flash Gordon himself Sam Jones gets in on the fun and it's just a he'll of a ride throughout but what it's mostly about is a 35 year old man growing up and being responsible in his life their is a tragic scene at the end of the film that kids would tear up at but the ending is funny as hell I just can't give it away but this is a film for adults I mean it's just downright surprising and funny when Ted nails one of his co workers and gets promoted and mila kunis and mark walhberg have such great chemistry that can't possibly be ignored there's not much romance in the film but just enough especially a scene where mark walhberg sings in a scene. But all and all this is a great film don't let haters keep you away from it sure it's not for everyone kids cough it has some vulgar language in it but not a ridiculous amount I really hope they give this a sequel or let Seth Mcfarlane direct another film because he's great at it and deserves to have a long career in Hollywood dark knight 951 out.,10,3,13,29 June 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," My review on the new take for spider-man
",This movie was absolutely brilliant it was funny and had great action scenes In it and had heart and was a fun ride throughout yeah sure this new take was more modern and less well ten years ago but in all seriousness this was much better than what I was expecting they did such a good job with all the characters they were spot on with them Martin sheen nailed uncle Ben down to the last note playing the innocent loving uncle and Sally field did a great job with aunt may playing the emotional and loving mother figure with what screen time she had Emma stone got right the smart and quirky Gwen Stacy who's top in her class and cares for Peter on a physical but especially emotional level but the chemistry between her and Andrew Garfield is well amazing and well thought out Rhys ifans is just a marvel at curt Connors/The lizard as he played the experimental scientist who you felt empathy for but at the same time he had to be stopped because as soon as he becomes the lizard it's all about getting rid of humans and replacing them with reptiles and world domination and a new species rising above humanity but doesn't realize their is an antidote which he probably should have anticipated but was barely stopped by spider-man at the end of the film and Andrew Garfield nothing short of amazing for Peter Parker/spider-man I thought he did a little bit of a better job for Peter Parker but he had some great moves for spider-man and you could tell he went through great fight training for the movie. But all and all the amazing spider-man will be one of big surprise sleeper hits of 2012 and will set up a great future movie series the after credits scene was very interesting and we'll have to wait and see what villain their talking about in that particular scene in the sequel movie darkknight951 out.,10,4,10,8 July 2012
Prometheus," My take on Ridley scoffs connection movie tot he alien franchise
",Well first of all I just want to say that Prometheus is one of the best sic-fi films I've seen in the last 10 years it was great but not perfect. I thought that most of the performances were great especially Micheal fassbenders performance you don't know what he's going to do because unlike the rest of the crew he has no emotions he has no soul and he does indeed make questionable decisions that make you wonder if he even does have a soul noomi rapace's character is the heroine of the movie and one of the doctors who think that they have found evidence that their were life forms from the planet that they're on created humans but find out that everything is not what it seems on the planet which they find out later on in the film I really liked how in first half of the film nothing happened to the people it was all silent until their second trip to the planet then things started to really spiral out of control and the dying started and certain characters Charlize theron's character for example started to make stupid decisions that affected their lives and the ending is the best part of the film you won't be disappointed with that if you want a reason to go to the film go to see the ending the only thing that I have to say the movie really suffered from was character backstory none of them had one we know nothing about them we don't know why they were on that trip what their job is do they have a life outside of the ship and what are their motives the whole time were left wondering what's this person's agenda. All and all it was still a great film not perfect certainly not as great as alien but still a good film and one that I recommend seeing darkknight951 out.,Null,0,0,9 June 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," My take on Christopher Nolan's final bat flick
",Awesome just great the best of the trilogy great action and fights and a great story and it ties up all the loose ends in probably one of the greatest trilogies of all time and it was better than the dark knight and Anne Hathaway nailed cat woman I mean she did much better than I thought she would and she was an even better selling Kyle and Micheal Caine still has so much heart sorrow and care for Bruce Waynes well being playing his role perfectly as Alfred the nice butler who has taken care of Bruce Wayne his whole life and Morgan Freeman returning as the technical expert and he creates some cool gadgets for Bruce Wayne and I mean cool bane was played magnificently by Tom hardy who is a very talented actor bane was cool calculating and had a plan from the get go he was brash mean but you felt bad for him because even though he was cold and mean Nolan manages to make him look innocent and at the same time shows how people can go bad from being in prison for so long Marion coltillard also did a great job playing a certain characters daughter and playing the innocent looking woman but what really surprised me the most was who Joseph Gordon Levitt was actually playing it will stun you trust me it stunned me. The movie was very thrilling until the very end and no one is safe not even batman himself Nolan also did a wonderful job showing Bruce Wayne to rise back up hence the title and become the hero that Gotham city needs. All and all the dark knight rises was perfect down to the last scene of the movie which is awesome I really hate that Nolan's not doing another one Warner brothers has got their work cut out for them on rebooting this character but I hope Nolan s at least a producer on the film because he deserves it but i guess we'll all have to wait and see what happens dark knight 951 out.,10,1,4,21 July 2012
