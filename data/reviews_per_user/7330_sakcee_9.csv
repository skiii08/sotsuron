Requiem for a Dream," I could feel pain in my heart
","It is one the best movies ever, it is so disturbing that I dont have the heart to watch it again and I love weird movies. It is as visuallly intense as Dead Alive, OMG how the *beep* they make such a powerful film.",Null,0,1,21 July 2003
Star Trek Into Darkness," Not Very Good
","I liked the first one of 2009 better. The story is not good in this one. Some cheesy comebacks like original Spock, The KHAAAANNN roar , silly dying scene etc.Story was never good. Effects are OK but not very good. Too much action, running around , explosions.I like The Next Generation a lot, compared to that this one is a big let down. Any given TNG episode is better than this movieThe 8.4 rating is very misleading, JJ Abrahams is not good for trek franchise, his movies will not be remembered welltoo bad, I was looking forward to liking thiseven the opening planet save scene was mediocre at best, better openings in TNG",7,4,9,18 May 2013
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Excellent, Intelligent , Amazing, Mind-job
","This is the best spy on-the-edge-of-your-seat thriller I have watched. It does not have James bond's tacky trickery. It does not have too fast, Holywooded action of bourne movies. This one is a mind job, the dialogues, the suspense, the cat and mouse game. It is better than Redford's 'Spy Games' which I own a copy of.Take your girl friend with you, she will complain that it is not a happy happy movie and she will have to think for a change /jk :) not-reallyjustsogreat",10,2,4,19 December 2011
Ratatouille," Best Animation --- Most BORING Pixar yet
","The movie is the most boring of all the pixar movies. I am not sure why it was necessary to over represent the french food and french snottiness. There was no story , There wasn't even any adventure or drama. It was just mundane and lame. I loved all the previous pixar movies. This one is a big let down. The chefs in the movie actually make fun of American food, burritos , hotdogs and even Asian food. I don't think that was necessary, all these choices makes America such a great place. and since when are food critics the biggest villains. I am not sure who is incharge at pixar for creative ideas for emphasizing the french. The small part of Edna in Incredible was fine. but this movie is kinda stretching it",3,11,24,8 July 2007
Hellboy," One of the best !!!
","The film is very unique . Best of Geriemo del tor .A misfit devil trying to fit into being human. Falling for a human freak girl. A human genetic Anomaly who likes rotten eggs . So memorable characters.! Jon hurt , Ron Perlman , Joseph pierce Hyde , Liz are perfect cast . These bunch of misfits , discarded and shunned by mainstream , go on to help and save the world with their weirdness . It is a piece of beauty by del tor . It's a labor of love ! I own it on DVD and blue-ray and maybe another DVD backup . I come back and back again to it . Go see it, if you like sci if , underdogs , fantasy and misfits",10,3,4,5 September 2015
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," It is a Beauty !!
","This is one of the best movies about human spirit, adventurousness and striving for a goal.The movie is about love, encouragement, friendship and going where no man has gone before.It is the best ben stiller comedy since 'There's something about Mary'.Who among us has not day dreamed about going to adventure in far off places.There are references to space travel, detective work, women who can bake, motherhood, sisterhood, wife in a woman, nod to geekiness and neediness in all of normal people.I especially like the role of Walter's object of affection. instead of portraying her as 'sex-and-city' wannabe. She was portrayed as encouraging friend rather than 'modern, independent, fast-talking' career woman. When a man marries a woman, he is marrying a encouraging friend who stands by him, through thick-n-thin. not sex-crazed club-going feminist machine. This movie, It is a beauty !!!",10,2,7,5 January 2014
Transformers," Finally Geeks have inherited the earth -- Thank God
","well in your faces all jocks and freaks. who is on top of you now. The geeks have inherited the earth. pixar, transformers, LOTR, King Kong , When was the last time a film without cgi or sci-fi , fantasy theme was a hit. Thanks to all the SuperGeeks, bill gates, steve jobs, google guys, internet, pixar, Lucas, Spielberg. as bill gates said, 'be nice to geeks, chances are you will end up working for one of them'. As tech will come to everywhere , so shall more opportunities, professions will disappear and only geeks will remain. . . . __________ ___________________ ________________ _____________ _____________ ______ ______",10,3,8,9 July 2007
Easy A," A is for Awesome
","I really liked the movie. Emma Stone is really shinning in this, some of the scenes were very difficult like the one about singing the cheesy song on weekend , but she made it look flawless. Also it is great to see that the movies are changing from the Animal House or Grease type high school cool kids version to more Freak N Geeks, EasyA type movies. I highly recommend the movie . it is very funny. All the theater was laughing in almost every scene. the soundtrack was also pretty cool. I usually don't see teen comedies but this is not typical MTV Lugana Beach teen _rap , it is like freak'n'geek type comedy and if you were one of the regular 90% of high school crowd. you will relate to it and love it",10,1,3,24 September 2010
The Great Gatsby," what a Sh**y movie
","God! what were they thinking!, Leonardo has become good at playing useless, hollow characters and overacting in them.what a true waste. The period description is not accurate, the sets are not believable as 20,30's newyork. Too much of trickery, effect laden set design, BAD BAD 3dThe 20's are better represented in the 'thirteenth floor' sci-fi movie. What a waste, the start of movie is a mess of whoreing around2nd part is supposed to be a romantic drama , but what a stupid one, its not that difficult to get a divorce etc, utter non-senseI walked out around 1/2 way, tried going back in and watching again but too many cheesy clich√©s also whats with the hip-hop and electro music, I was hoping to hear some jazzy tunes, the mood was out of touch with period.I researched the movie before going and only went because the director is the same as of 'Australia' which I liked a lot, what a waste",1,31,52,19 May 2013
