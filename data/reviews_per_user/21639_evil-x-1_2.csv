Changeling," A Masterpiece
","The year is 1928.Changeling tells the story of a woman who returns home one day and finds out that her young boy is missing,so she reports her missing son to the police and after a few months police finds and returns her son to her mother, but after having a look at the young boy she claims that he is not her son.Its a movie based on a real life incident.Once you start watching this movie you will be deeply engrossed.the twists in the plot are amazing.immense attention has been given to each and every detail. This movie is perfect, from acting to the setting of the movie, the late 1920's has been projected superbly,awesome direction and acting makes this movie one of the best movies of 2008 and is capable of winning an Oscar.",10,7,11,26 December 2008
The Reader," Total Waste Of Time
","After watching this movie i wish i had not seen it. This movie is very boring.The story was OK but somehow the movie seemed extremely boring.There are some things that are not revealed during a film but one hopes that they would be at the end of the film, but that is not the case here,after watching the movie i had many questions racing through my mind.But the answers have not been given in the movie.i am actually surprised how this movie was nominated for Oscars. i would not recommend anyone to watch this movie.",1,6,39,28 January 2009
