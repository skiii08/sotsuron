The Avengers," I saw the movie with high hopes.
","It is very much save to say that only truly super hero addicts will love this. I don't read the comics anymore because Id rather read a book or watch a movie could be my age as well. This is overrated beyond all ends. The villain is annoying beyond all ends. Because you have to incorporate so many characters you have to cram all this crap into one movie and personally the individual films are much better. This felt like an overdose of flashy sh*t everywhere and the story is rather dull. I went in this movie with high hopes because I on occasion enjoy super hero movies. My favorites have to be the Tim Burton & Christopher Nolan Batman films. Those were fantastic. This is a mess. With over two hours of flashy ridiculous plot twists and cgi up the a** only Super Hero, Comic Book, Addicts and little kids will really appreciate this. If you have a brain and want more realism in a film avoid this crap aside. I gave it a 5 because some of the special effects were impressive and some of the action was cool and lets be real Scarlett Johanson is hot as hell. But this movie barely qualifies as a 5. You want a true action film with a super hero taste go with The Dark Knight or Batman Begins.",5,5,11,29 September 2013
Silver Linings Playbook," An Amazing Movie.
","This film has everything. There is beautifully written script that held fantastic off-beat humor, and flawless acting that I believe was by the entire cast. Bradley Cooper has given a performance that I think a lot of people never expected by that guy from The Hangover. Jennifer Lawrence gave a performance so fantastic that I think she is going to be a great actress to follow for years. Robert De Niro was well Robert De Niro he was fantastic as always. Chris Tucker was fantastic in his small but hysterical role.I can say if you want to watch a off-beat comedy with excellent dramatic acting in a exceptional script do not hesitate to watch this beautiful film. This is a film that can make people that are having a bad day be happy. It can easily be in my top 10 films of favorite movies of all time Honestly.",10,0,2,29 September 2013
