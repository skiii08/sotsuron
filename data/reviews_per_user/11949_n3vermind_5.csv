National Treasure: Book of Secrets," The words that come to mind is 'Cash Cow'
","Alright so I'm not a big fan of the first NT movie but I still rated it 6 out of 10 back then. I did this because the 'hunt' in that movie was entertaining with a few glimpse or originality here and there which made parts of it interesting.The problem is, NT was already built on a borrowed concept, standing on the shoulders of The DaVinci Code it knew it had an audience and admirably tried to include more action and free it from religion. Voila, you got National Treasure.Now you got a hit on your hands and you know you have to milk it and it better be fast because it wasn't THAT big of a hit, people might not remember it in say, 4 years. I then imagine you split up the workload for the script of the movie like this: 1 guy thinks of funny clues, 1 guy thinks of some extra background story for the characters and the dialogue they have George Lucas write, because let's face it, he's cheap.Finally you put all 3 into the same Word document and you send it straight to production because damn it, it's milking time. The director probably asks for a few re-writes before the studio says 'that's it, go with it'. I'm not sure if he tries to salvage the script in any way because as it's apparent to us, the acting in this movie is non-existing. Finally the thing get's edited and every scene gets as much dialogue and story cut out because of how awful it is.Seriously, those of you saying Jon Voigt or Helen Mirren do a good job in this movie, come on. They are both known as serious good actors and that's why people try to justify parts of this movie by accentuating them but the truth is they showed up, slept through it and got paid. Yes, it's that kind of movie! This movie relies on people liking half-asses put together 'puzzles' and even more so on hard cut in editing. I am not surprised another one is in the making at all but with this on being based on such a thin story I can't see how the 3rd one can avoid complete disaster. Ow don't worry it will still make money.4 out 10 because it wasn't a total waste of time but really close to it, mind you.",4,7,14,30 April 2008
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," KB1: 'KB2 you complete me!'
","QT does a fine job once again. I will admit that I don't think that either of these two movies will live as long as Resevoir dogs or Pulp Fiction at all but as a movie addict I was pleasantly surprised with this second installment.I've heard so many times that QT despises the new SFX/CGI trend in Hollywood. If he does feel this way I think it's a pretty weak way of thinking. Sure you can always argue that the CGI takes the focus away from the story, the acting and all the other things we as individuals feel would make a better movie. I disagree, it's just a tool, just like the strings he works with, the fake blood and the stuntment. QT draws the line on what movies can use to convey their message, big man, but kinda stupid considering the business he is in.Getting back to the movie, for quick reference I would like to say that I think KB1 was a very mediocre film where QT decides to take make a ballet of violence combined with mange cartoon to make it more artistic, because if you make violence artistic you can cover up for the fact that you are still going for the shock effect which sells tickets. This second movie shows a lot more depth, better acting, reveals the characters, offers more story buildup and a few twists that were also left out in the first movie. Overall I think QT has probably succeeded in achieving his goal with these two movies. Each of them gives us the moviegoers something different to get excited about, where KB1 definitely gives us violence galore and overtime action, this sequel brings depth to both.I'll give this one 8/10 and say that I'm sorry for thinking after the first one that QT was heading for a disaster. He pulls out fine, but not a masterpiece.",10,0,1,1 August 2004
Mission: Impossible III," Action for the kids, nothing for anyone else
","So what went wrong?...Well, first off, there seems to be a great difference in general about the prequels to this movie. The first one was an intense movie that lacked action a great deal whereas the second one was really just action and absolutely nothing more. Now, if you ask me which movie I like best and which one is the most true to one of the TV-shows bla bla bla I have to draw a blank. The first one, for me, can be seen more times and the second one gives me the 30 minute adrenaline rush at the end every time. I like them both at their own merits and I can't determine which one is best, it depends on my mood, so no I will not shoot down the second one.What has happened now is what might seem like the ultimate solution to appeal to a wider audience, combine the intense plot with tons of 'impossible' action. I must admit that even to me that sounds great... On paper. On the big screen, as it turns out, it just doesn't work. Who would have figured that?In this movie they try to expand on the character of Ethan Hunt and they simply fail. They try to almost copy/paste the story of the first movie and damn if they don't try to copy John Woo's action style (only in the beginning though Abrams leaves his mark in the few uncreative ways he can think of). Wanting to succeed so bad in both the thriller and action genre seems to have forced J.J. into formula film making. This is always good for the youngsters so the movie will make it's money back.For those of us over 15 we are left standing lonely in the outside the theater hoping for the manager to realize what he has done and give us a refund.Some quick tips for those who haven't seen it and are on the fence about it:<ul><li>If you liked the first movie but not the second, don't see this one. - If you liked the second movie but not the first, don't see this one. - If you just like a lot of un-innovative action and a predictable storyline, well gosh darn it if this isn't the movie for you.</li></ul>4/10 - For some entertainment value here and there.",4,11,22,6 May 2006
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Funny idea going nowhere
","I remember gaining respect for Brad Pitts acting abilities in 12 Monkeys as he broke his calm eye-candy type casting. I've been following him ever since hoping for him to be involved in a project where he stepped outside his comfort zone. I understand that he does movies like Oceans and Mr & Mrs Smith and that's all good but when it comes for him to pick movies with substance he always fails for some reason.Right now I'm asking myself whether it's because of the projects themselves or it's because he gets involved with them? Babel was in no way near to how good it could have been after I heard the pitch. Burn after reading is nothing but a over-hyped mess and now we have ole Benjamin Button.After watching the trailer I thought it might be a pretty cool story and it actually looked like Mr Pitt would be doing some acting overall. Alas the story struggled to combine a life and love story with a quirky but great original idea and failed.You will know that you have been tricked from the first scene with two women in a hospital and they start reading from Benjamin's journal. From then on the story continues to test our ability to stay alert and interested. We get excited about seeing just how well faces can be digitized and there are other great cinematic achievements within the movie but we can't very well say that the acting is one of them. Brad Pitt just goes with the flow, like Forest Gump only without the personality, and basically just stands around looking good. Cate's character is so all over the place that you never get any indication of what type of person she is, there is no depth to her at all. When all is said and done you leave the theater thinking 'wow, they could really make Brad Pitt look old and young'. As for the movie itself you will remember it as boring and full of clich√©s desperately trying to cater to our emotions but it just can't get there.It was a funny and original idea, it just didn't go anywhere at all.",5,3,6,4 January 2009
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Megan Fox and shiny cars
","Don't get it twisted, I am the biggest CGI fan on the planet, I mean to the point where it becomes ridiculous. I can hardly mention how intimate I got with myself during Jurassic Park and T2 back in the days. For me CGI is incredible because when it's done right it opens up new worlds and fantasies. Look at JP, Matrix, LOTR, these are examples where it works, in this movie it doesn't.We've seen the first Transformers, they can transform and it looks good and that's why I actually kinda liked the first one. I agree that the plot was thin already in the first one but the new type of cgi used made it a worthwhile movie in my book, a great theater experience.So these days you have to make a trilogy if the first one is successful, it's simply one of the ways the studios make bank. In some cases the sequel gets pushed through just for the sake of making a sequel. You saw it with Matrix and Spiderman how horrible it can be, but with Transformers we have found a new low, one that I think will not be beaten for a very long time.It's simple, there is no creativity, no idea, no story, no message and nothing new at all. This is a 2 hours action ride that ultimately have you hoping for the doors to be kicked in to have the theater taken over by terrorists or something else to break the sleep hypnotic piece of crap you are watching (ouch, I went full out hate, ow well lets keep going).Let's just assault the premise of the movie a bit.Megatron was killed in the first one. You might think they would disassemble him, melt him down, send him to the sun or something to make sure this was it. Naaah, the American government and those in charge of security had a brain aneurysm here. Instead they thought 'hmm what are we going to do with this dangerous creation now that it's dead?'. The answer was of course to drop it in the ocean and keep like 10 cruisers and submarines around JUST IN CASE he should wake up again or someone might come to pick him up. This is early in the movie that this moronic premise is revealed.So I won't reveal anymore because then it becomes spoilers but if you have a brain you HAVE to leave it at home if you want to see this movie. Seriously, do not think about ANYTHING. Look at the transforming cars and let out the occasional 'wow' and you might actually make it out. My IQ dropped about 50 points from watching this movie which explains why I can't spell English words anymore I suspect but at least I made it out, I doubt everybody will be so lucky.Trust me, the last 45 minutes you will be begging for the movie to end and you wished you would have never have to listen to 30 minutes of actors trying to justify the most ridiculous plot in movie history.But Hey, Megan Fox's titties bounces around a lot and there is a nice shameless intro shot of her on a bike. The people HAVE spoken, this is a commercial success but I dare ANYONE to try and watch this movie twice, it simply can't be done unless you are completely retarded.",1,14,31,11 July 2009
