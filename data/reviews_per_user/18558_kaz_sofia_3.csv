Scarface," Scarface is a good experince destroyed by Tony Montana clichês
","A movie that has a interesting propost and mensage, Scarface is a good work when it do a relation with a real historic fact, like the coming of cubans to United States (especially to Flórida) durring the socialist government of Fidel Castro, but it's a big clichê because of the building of the protagonist, Tony Montana. The cuban drug dealer, that build his criminal career in US, has a big different between other character interpretated by Al Pacino, Michael Corleone, of The Godfather trilogy, with his descontrolation and his personally extremally violent and authoritarian. It's like Tony Montana is a comic caricature full of various stereotypes of the bandit, not a reality artistic representation.
Scarface had a good base to be a good movie, but the way how Tony Montana was made destructed all the work. Everything about the protagonist is extreme, his violence and his authoritarism. Nothing is balanced in Tony Montana actions like he hasn't a ration and emotion control, but a supergo in his brain. Obvious the objective of Brian de Palma e Oliver Stone (director and roterist, respectively) was create an Antonio Montana irrational and unbalanced, but it's create a Tony Montana ufanist and alienated. All violence and arrogance that character use to fight in situations are show when the protagonist uses the word 'fvck' 152 times in movie, showing his violence is not only fisic, but verbal too. The arrogance of Tony Montana transforme in a powerful energy when he think he can fight with the legion of Alejandro Sosa men when the bolivian drug dealer invade Tony Montana mansion, like a super man. Tony Montana isn't an admirable anti-hero, but a disgusting anti-hero, a character that express hate about Fidel Castro regime, who start his government in Cuba in 1959, but he is authoritarian like the cuban leader with all people, including his sister and his friend that died by Tony because of his relationship with Tony's sister.
The age when the movie live was a conturbade period, ideologically and polically. The cold war against URSS/Cuba and the american civil culture with armamentism and racism, the United States lived in an intensive fight. The violence of the movie is contraditory, because, in same time it can be understood like a representation of USA in this time, it's inexplicated (main Tony Montana) because the movie focus more in this violence than in history and operation of crime and its consequence to people, like made The Godfather, the best crime movie of history. The only consequence of crime showed in the film is Tony Montana death showed in a clichê form with the saying 'power corrupts the humans', when the protagonist dies in his piscine with the saying 'power corrupts man' that was old Tony boos Frank's piscine mansion. if the movie's mensage are converted to any politic history, for example, the clichês will be the same. If I can describe Scarface in a only sentences, will be: 'interesting, but clichê'.",7,0,1,3 April 2020
Spirited Away," Chihiro is an ative agent in Spirited Away. It's transformate the way to express the childhood in animations
","Spirited Away is, of course, a big experience to evertyone who wants to know the process between chidhood and adulthood/amadureciment. The film express this theme thought Chihiro, the main agent of this process, who doesnt have the perspective of the adult age, like a psychology book about chilhood, but the movie shows the consequences of this transition thought the own children.
Chihiro is showed in the beginning like a spoiled girl that all time is complaining about everything and everybody. She complain about the fact her are going to other city and about the fact her flower are dying (this is her responsability). In this first half of movie, Chihiro is, basically, a girl who have fight with whole the world about little things. With the happening of the story, when this parents are transformate in pigs and the region of restaurants started to be invades by ghost and sobrenatural criatures, the world had the effort to challenge Chihiro to get out of this situation, and this is one of the mensages of the movie: The world is a place that is indiferent or againt you.
To survive, Chihiro need to work in this sobrenatural society, a society that have a big obssession for gold. In this little information, is possible to compare with the capitalist real world about work and greed, for example Yubaba, the society's leader who's appear in movie like a authoritarian person. Yubaba, who's represent the boss, the politic and all of people who's only see money, shows her insanity when she 'take' Chihiro's name, removing some letters in kanji (japanese writing) e transforme it in 'Sen'. The name 'Chihiro' is formated by 'thousand' and 'search' kanjis, representing the person who's is big, numerally, but 'Sen', name imposted by Yubaba, is formated only by 'thousand' kanji, transforming Chihiro in a number. However, the most interesting about Yubaba is, not necessary, she is retrated like a bad character even have some characteristics of ocidental animations villains, like Disney. In some moments, she helps the people in some hard works in the bathroom, like in the 'stink spirit'(Kawa no Kami)'s incident, when she motivate Chihiro/Sen to serve the customer. An antagonist building that isn't totally bad distance of cliches animation and transforme Yubaba in a more humanizate character.
When it's know all dificulties that fight in this journey, important to her ripening that isn't 'opost to chilhood' in any moment, many elements appear in movie, main in the second half, represent the memorie and the nostalgia of chilhood not valorized by Chihiro in the benning. The hair tie gived by Zeniba (Yubaba's sister) and stitched by No-Face (Bandai-Gaeru) is one of this elements. This Tie, that according to Zeniba can protect Chihiro of all bad things, transforme the material object, liked to polit in the capitalist world, in a emotional object, when, in this topic, express the emotional value of the things and not only the finantial value is part of individual ripening.
Spirited Away is one of the best Hayao Miyazaki's movies. Chihiro is not a passive agent that only see the world happen in your life, that is the form to represent the childhood in many times, but a ative agent who can build new thing in the world and suffers the consequences of his actions because the child is part of the world too. Like say the song of the brazilin poet and composer Arnaldo Antunes: 'Everybody was child yet, Einstein, Freud and Plato too/Hitler, Bush and Saddam Hussei/Who have money and who doesn't have'",10,0,0,3 April 2020
Parasite," The 'parasite' can be Kim or Park family and can be all of sentiments that kill people (envy and greed)
","With a great mundial attention, Parasite surprise evertyone win 4 orcars against favorites movies like 1917 (Sam Mendes) and The Irishman (Martin Scorcese), and all of this is not for nothing: Parasite is a refletion about politics scenario about misery, social inequality and other social problems that aren't be seen, mainly in a country like South Korea that is always showed like a technology and science power without any social problem (that is deny in Bong Joon-ho film).
Like as all movie that talk about humanities contrast and inequality, Parasite is a relation between Kim family and Park family: the fisrt lives in a house basement and the second family lives in a beautiful and big mansion in a elite neighbourhood. In addition focus in scenes that show the both ambients, the movie has another way to show the inequality between Kim and Park: Kim and Park are two of three of most popular and communs surnamens is South Korea, however, Kim is most commun (21% of koreans) than Park (9%).
The contrast in the reality not only in South Korea, but alround the world, is not realized by Kim family when they are work in many funtions in Park mansion, as like they are part of the Park family. The lack of class awareness in a group that feel privileged by an elite that always oppressed is showed when Choong-sook say 'she isn't poor' to Moon-gwang, the last Park housekepper, when she founds Moon-gwang's husband in basement.
There'is a discussion about is the 'parasite' in movie is about Kim family, that lives in Park home illegaly, or about Park family, that explore the work of Kim with the inequality. Actuallity, the parasite is about the actions of the both family and, in same time, is the envy, the greed and the preconception that kill Kim- jeong and Nathan Park. Therefore, Parasite has a many interpretations about an only mensage
All of the adventure vivenced by Kim started with a rock brought by Min, Ki-woo's friend, that is an amulet very commun in asian countries that bring lucky to families. This object is very important to undestand the movie because many events in movies is about it and it construct slowly the social context of movie: The first event is a Choong-sook commentary when Min brings the amulet, when she say: 'It would be better if is was food', showing that the basic necessites is most importante than religion. The second event is when Ki-woo go down the basement to give the amulet to Moon-gwang and Geun-sae like a gift, but the man almost kill the boy blow to the head, and the third, and the last, event about this amulet is when the rock is returned to river, like Kim family is returned to misery after the happening in Dae-song party. In any moment in the movie, the amulet is showed like a religious object that can save somebody of poorness and misery, but is showed only like a material object, the same manner that capitalism sees the world and the same manner that inequality and poorness is in the world, a fisical and real problem. As Kim-Ki-taek said: 'That's the reason that people can't be have a plan. Without plan, nothing can't be wrong'.",9,0,2,28 February 2020
