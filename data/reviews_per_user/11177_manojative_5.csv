The Equalizer," Entirely too predictable..
","The only thing that was not predictable was somehow you sensed some twist is coming, but it never does. A regular superhero movie without being called it that. The protagonist, our beloved Mr. Washington, never sets a foot wrong. Never ever gets beaten and is always two steps ahead of the bad guys. The action sequences are well done and I quite enjoyed them. The humane story arcs of helping someone at your mundane jobs, (playing batman at night), and telling that he had a dark and painful past was too forced (he takes a break from all the action, travels to some important person's house for a few days, just to explain that there is a past!!!! 20 minutes just for that! Out of nowhere!). There is absolutely no reason for anyone to spoil the movie.. It spoils itself.",6,0,2,2 November 2014
War Dogs," Really good story told beautifully well !
","I had a chance to see this movie in an early screening. I am not a big fan of Jonah Hills body of work (nor do I hate his work); nevertheless, he has managed to surprise me in big productions like WoWS, Moneyball and Django. He stole the show in this one. He embodied the character so well that I actually forgot that he is the same guy from 21 Jump Street and Superbad. The swag he carried was unbelievable. His laugh is unforgettable! The story is portrayed from the POV of Miles Teller's character David Packouz who is a deadbeat albeit honest bed sheet salesman and a 'certified' massage therapist who is drawn into a shady world of arms dealing by Efraim (JH). He learns the ins and outs of the trade and helps their partnership grow and make tons of money. What happens during and after is for you to find out. Its an insanely fun ride. Cameo by Bradley Cooper, which btw not insignificant at all, as a sly but deadly operator is also memorable. All in all I enjoyed the movie a lot. Much better than all the superhero mania that's been going around this year. A mark of a good movie is that it keeps you engaged and keeps you wondering what happens next, and it avoids scenes where you go, 'oh, come on!' (like you did when Superman went, 'Martha!'), and it did all that. Not comparing to any of the blockbusters to be fair, but this movie stands on its own. Go see it!",8,3,9,16 August 2016
Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping," It's funny, cleverly mocking the pop culture and predictable
","We got lucky to see the advanced screening of Popstar. It is a very straightforward and predictable story. But that is intentionally so, taking a dig at the pop movies. It parodies every aspect of pop media, the TMZ, the paparazzi, the entourage, the egos, the commercialization etc.The cleverness and comedy is not in the story. It is in the telling of it. It is what happens along the way. It is one of the funniest movies you'll see the whole year. The acting by the Lonely Island group is spot on with their comedic timing. The whole 'The Office' themed documentary style also bodes well with the theme. And at last the music. The whole idea behind the movie, according to Andy Samberg, was to 'showcase the music they created, so they made a movie around it'. Now I won't go as far as to say that the music will win Emmy's but it sure was catchy and funny! It is a one time watch movies that will not disappoint.",7,10,33,3 June 2016
Man of Steel," If you got a problem, punch it to pulp!
","It's a good enough movie, but I am really disappointed. They could have made it so much better, so epic. First the good parts: There is so much action, in abundance from start to finish. Visuals are stunning. Music is amazing. Acting is good too, especially Russel Crowe.The bad part: The story. What was the story? It was an alien invasion from start to finish. Like Independence Day kind of even. I agree that even Avengers was Alien invasion in essence, but every minute of it was enjoyable. There was humor, wit, interesting characters, well timed and purposeful action. This movie lacked exactly those things. To be sure, it is much better than Transformers- Dark of the moon, which also falls in the same category, but on the scale of Transformers to Avengers, Man of Steel falls a lot closer to Transformers than it does to Avengers. The story is simple enough as stated in the Plot summary. So the rest is filled with fist fights. Since the bullets and missiles can't hurt Kriptonians there is no point of gun fight. Its just Hulk meet good looks, and less humor...thats it. People who want just action, will not be disappointed, but people who expect Batman kind of take on the Superman series or even a serious franchise about story and legacy, wait until the DVDs come out.",6,0,1,15 June 2013
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," With so many plot holes, it was just a rain of fists
","I went in with very low expectations after seeing all the mixed reviews. So I wasn't disappointed, but in the end came out feeling, yeah, the reviews are mixed because it is a mixed bag. The story had so many loopholes that I was wondering if Chris Terrio was at all involved here. There were so many meaningless subplots that I just didn't find what was the point of all this. For example. what exactly was the role of Wonder Woman? Did she really have to be thee? And how original, put Lois Lane in danger and in comes the Superman. He has a homing beacon set up on her that he can get there to help from anywhere in the world. But hey he only had one of those so he couldn't put one on her mom! And guess what Lex knew exactly how many beacons you were issued from the Krypton, so he kidnaps Superman's girlfriend to summon him and his mom so Lex can blackmail him. Oh and don't get me started on Batman. He is supposed to be the best detective in the whole world, but does he see that he's been set up to be a pawn in Lex's game? nope! I was laughing when Bruce Wayne just walks to anywhere in Lex's house and finds any open port to plug his 'bat hack machine' and expects that no one notices. Can you count how many plot holes were there in just that one line? When CinemaSins sit down to do this movie, they will quit it half way and say 'fuck it, I cant do this anymore!' The only reason I gave 6/10 in this movie is that all the actors did a great job with whatever they were given. Last half hour was a good action sequence, although it was basically same as the Man of Steel. The music was good and that is about it.",6,1,3,28 March 2016
