Blade Runner 2049," BladeRunner Wannabee 2017
","After watching from start to end of the credits, I wonder what 'secret sauce' I had missed that had the press and all the fans' see the sequel as 'better than the original,' 'Best movie of the year!' and being able to compare this film and Villenueve to the work of Stanley Kubrick.BLADERUNNER2049 employs the latest CG techniques and effects and brought a few new ideas for the genre that I expect to see subsequent attempts to further improve. But aside from a few nice touches and obviously having spent a good chunk of the budget on the digital effects to create impressive visuals for the film, none of it points to innovation that betters the original.Of all the scenes in BLADERUNNER2049 that try to work off-of and improve upon what we liked in BLADERUNNER(1982), the original still does a much better job convincing us of the future where countries and nationality have less meaning than the category/class of existence to which we are assigned to - either to serve, lead, or follow.With the top-billing cast, you'd expect the audience to be challenged to decide which actor successfully steals which scene(s) over the others... in my opinion, other than some of the moments with Ana De Armas (playing a VR romantic companion) and Sylvia Hoecks (basically a Terminator-type character that reminds us of Famke Janssen from 10-15 years back), the lines and story just didn't seem allow the actors and scenes to work effectively enough to convince us this was any more than actors playing characters from their previous, more acclaimed, work - we see Ryan Gosling playing 'Driver' from DRIVE (2011) in the year 2049. We see Harrison Ford playing Deckard with a heavy touch of Richard Kimble (The FUGITIVE, 1993). We see Jared Leto in one of his worst performances to date - it is as if he was trying to mimic Christopher Walken reading out lines from TRUE ROMANCE (1993), but with a delivery that comes across as if he's reading the material for the first time. Robin Wright starts off strong and finishes strong, but somehow in between manages to be put into a surprisingly bad scene - with some of the worst lines that seem to be aiming as either a conflict resolve, plot-twist, or a L.A. CONFIDENTIAL 'Rolo Tomasi' moment - seriously, this was one of the worst scenes in the movie that rivaled all the scenes with Jared Leto where he was asked to speak.What made BLADERUNNER(1982) a sleeper that took years to grow into a cult hit and a milestone in cinema, is its ability to make the audience ask questions that isn't forced upon us - we see young Deckard being asked to do a job that he wasn't given the ability to question, but in the end he, along with the audience are led to ask ourselves not only the question, 'What makes us Human?' but 'What makes one Human more deserving of life and freedom than another?' In BLADERUNNER2049, we no longer question our existence, our purpose, or our rights to freedom... maybe those ideas are already cliche's in cinema at this point. In BLADERUNNER2049, the audience is instead constantly being asked to focus on asking 'Wow, Replicants can now do that?' BLADERUNNER(1982) allowed us to takeaway with questions that apply to our time and world, but it does not attempt to cram these concepts and existentialist questions onto the audience in place of entertainment value - existentialism and intellectual appeals aside, it's a great adaptation of Film Noir into Science Fiction, and is above all a great movie.In the first film, the enemy was time and the hunted - in turn, no one was safe. In BLADERUNNER2049, the enemy is a character packaged like a GQ fall/winter fashion spread, along with a battalion of Agent Smith's(MATRIX) led by agent Luv (a combination of TERMINATOR/AgentSmith/X-Men). As to the ambition of the Dr. Evil character (played by Leto)? That is never addressed beyond a clich√© claim of world-domination - simple layman-deduction would point to the fact that if you can own the ability to create life, then what higher-level achievements are you looking to attain - If it's an upgrade for a 'replicant' to be able to pro-create, don't humans already have that ability without the need of higher-technology?BLADERUNNER2049 is a mash-up of ideas and devices employed by critically acclaimed and/or hit films made in the past 20 years (i.e. MATRIX, HER, SOLARIS, & Mamoru Ishii's AVALON, etc). While it utilizes the most updated audio and visual technology to align with what is the best in class, it falls short in having a story that can drive the film for audience to not start looking at their watches (or cellphones) after the 2nd Jared Leto monologue.last but not least, the duration of the film could have been cut by at least 30' and it would have been the same story, but I guess fans of seeing Ryan Gosling posing pensively may disagree. Now that BLADERUNNER has a sequel, as a die-hard fan of the original 1982 cinema version, I just hope someone else will make another attempt to do the story and its characters right. We need a CG Rachel as much as we needed a CG Princess Leia in Starwars: Rogue1.",5,10,25,5 October 2017
Inglourious Basterds," Tarantino tribute to old-school cinema
","Whether this is Tarantino's tribute to old school WWII film in the tradition of THE DIRTY DOZEN, or his way of paying homage to his trademarks using a war film setting, watching INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS makes me think the Weinsteins wanted to make sure the audience is not just the Tarantino fan base, but also older audiences who has their personal connection to stories set in WWII (whether from personal experience, or just from having grown up watching classic war films).While Brad Pitt gets top billing, it is the European actors like Christoph Waltz, Til Schweiger, and Melanie Laurent, who really steal the show. This film, in fact, has more German and French dialogue than English. Christoph Waltz, in particular, delivers an amazing performance that is on par with Ulrich Muhe's in THE LIVES OF OTHERS. Every time the guy is on screen, the tension and suspense is so thick you could slice it with a knife.If you're looking for Tarantino trademarks (including the abundance of trademarks from other movies and filmmakers that inspired those Tarantino has made himself known for), this movie is filled with them, and deviced and laid out so conspicuously that it's fit for a 'spot the trade mark' drinking game. Whether there is any anti-war sentiment intended, it almost seems irrelevant - it's catharsis all the way through from start to finish. Any message is more of an inference the audience would need to create out of their own imagination and sentiments.As with almost all Tarantino films, forgotten stars are brought back to the screen (e.g. Travolta in PULP FICTION, Pam Grier & Robert Forster in JACKIE BROWN, etc.). Whatever career boosts previous Tarantino films managed to bring to has-been stars, this one was just a nice touch with the cameo of 50's screen heartthrob ROD TAYLOR (who played lead-roles in the original TIME MACHINE, and Hitchcock's THE BIRDS) in a short scene as Winston Churchhill. The use of Ennio Morricone scores worked very well with the photography to remind everyone what made movies great before the age of CGI and video cinematography.Now if only Brad Pitt could move away from his over-the-top mash-up of Southern accents that's reminiscent of Early Grayce (KALIFORNIA), the experience would have been more to my 'satisFICation.' Nevertheless, this is probably Tarantino's most Oscar-friendly work to date.",8,2,8,28 August 2009
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," 10 Things The Last Jedi will be remembered for:
","In no particular order...1) The Mel Brooks (Space Balls) moments with Dumhnall Gleeson, further accentuated with a cut-away shot to remind the audience it's a comic moment.2) Bombs in space within the StarWars universe can fall, just like things fall on Earth (because of gravity).3) Princess Leia's Superman moment - her body can defy the laws of physics - won't explode in spite of the lack of a pressurized suit, and she can fly through space.4) Supreme Leader Snoke can see through walls, eaves-drop across solar systems, and defend attacks with a twitch of his upper-lip, but one little accidental jab by a sabre can end him (like the inflatable pilot in Airplane (1979))5) Luke survived for years on an island drinking space-goat's milk, and housekeeping team is manned by fish-people.6) The Force now comes with Skype features. In addition, VR/AR capabilities that can fool even those who are equipped with The Force.7) more new toys to be made available from one episode than any other previous installments of Star Wars - including a Swarowski figurine.8) Luke Skywalker and Kylo Ren's Kurosawa - Samurai Stand-Off.9) You can track your target that's travelling in the speed of light, but in normal speed, you are only able to fire shots at your target but the shots don't the ability to land.10) Plot-holes are a plenty, and conflicting logic throughout The Last Jedi, but it'll still be the most profitable Hollywood product in 2017.",5,1,2,18 December 2017
2001: A Space Odyssey," 2001 vs 2010 -- from visionary to misguided bravery
","With all the controversy and endless conjectures generated from Kubrick's original, I think it was both a brave attempt and a misguided move for 2010 to have been made, and for no reason other than that any questions 2001 can provoke the audience to ask are not meant to be answered in our time. That remains to me an ingenious decision and marks Kubrick as a visionary in that he managed to create a story that compels the audience to create their unique thirst to want to know more.Prior to the time 2001 was made, there have not been many major Hollywood films that dare to take the approach of using lack-of-clarity as the intended pay-off. Kurosawa did it in 1950 with Rashomon as a break-through, but it is an entirely different topic than that of 2001--a story that, at the time it was made, the available science and technology could only provide conjectures to what belies in space travel, and the mysteries to the world outside our atmospheres... those myths still remain today.Remember the film was conceived and made before mankind had ever set foot on the moon. With all the research Kubrick invested in with consultants and Arthur C. Clarke, he knew it was better to have more questions unanswered, than to risk giving answers history and science could soon prove wrong... this is probably his greatest achievement as a story-teller with 2001: A Space Odyseey. If you watch the film again, try to count how many items, as well as technologies shown within are completely off based on what we actually have in application today. Aside from brand logo's, and maybe the details to how computer interfaces may differ from what we have today, there is nothing shown in the movie you can argue as 'outdated' or are completely wrong. If that is not the work of a visionary, I don't know what is. While I don't know if Kubrick himself deserves all the credit, as he certainly had the help from the best talents available, to accept the challenge and be able to convince a major studio such as MGM to entrust a production of that scale, and have enough sense to understand that sometimes it is better to not try to provide an answer when you may not even know what the question is, that is genius at work.It is not difficult to come up with a story and make a film that is confusing, and there are plenty of those for us to forget. What Kubrick & co. came up with is confusion that is at the same time compelling and thought-provoking... not to mention his film in many ways influenced designs in the future. Citing Dr. Strangelove as another example, he created the concept of a 'WAR ROOM' that had even Ronald Reagan asking to see when he became President of the United States, which to his disappointment, didn't really exist.2010 is a good film, but it will always be derivative, always in the shadow of 2001, and always pale by comparison. Think of X-files the TV-series in its first 3 seasons, and how everything went downhill when it became a movie, the fault was not in the production value or lacking in writing talent, but the mere fact that the 'payoff' that served to be the original and strongest hook was its ability to make us keep big bold question marks floating in our heads.Imagine LOST having a resolve... that would be the end to the magic.By making 2010, detractors of the narrative approach to 2001 will be satisfied, while fans of the original will object... and by virtue of its attempt to provide answers, it adds an expiration date to the story. Little did they know then that in just 6 years after the film was made, the COLD WAR would be a has-been.",9,0,2,26 July 2006
The Last Samurai," tripe sashimi
","take the ingredients of the Hollywood Western, displace it onto Asian shores, and focus it on a misfit who embodies the stereotype attributes: 1) faithless, 2) lacking in morals, & 3) reluctantly gets himself into a situation that calls for the wakening of conscience & the resurrection of his heroic ideals, now add the mythical attractions of the East from the P.O.V. of the West, and continue to enforce the believe that 'we're American, and even though there are lots of us--good and bad, we eventually will make your world a better place'...what do you get in result? a typical Hollywood treatment that caters not just to entertain the audience with a long stretch of some facts with fiction, but an indirect statement that can be inferred as glorification of values that once stood tall as pillars and foundations of the American spirit.Zwick probably did his research, and probably does have a lot of respect for the history, culture, and honors of the Japanese... but the film doesn't show it beyond the 'been there and done that' plot-points we've seen in so many other films dealing with Americans in Asia (think BLACK RAIN)--'we love your sense of honor and loyalty, and your artwork and etiquette... but we have a better way--better yet, we can adopt your ways and do it better than you, and your women will end up liking us too!' Tom Cruise hold no candle to the likes of Watanabe and Hiroyuki Sanada, but they are the support cast? wow, who came up with that formula? The Marketing guys thought hard about appeasing the Japanese audience with their revered thespians... but as a sidecast to Tom Cruise who basically plays the same character in every movie? movies don't have to be history books on film--all facts and no fiction, but I would expect this type of menudo to have been made in the 40's as WWII propaganda... we're in the 21st century now. If not for the innovation, audience do expect more than poorly written scripts that try to do a wool-pull over our eyes with budget and promotion.and on the battle-scenes, even Wong Kar'Wai's ASHES OF TIME (1994), made on a shoe-string budget compared to THE LAST SAMURAI, presented a more compelling and heroic depiction of the warrior's fight.",3,6,12,28 February 2006
The Departed," THE DEPARTED -- an INFERior Affair
","the original - INFERNAL AFFAIR is by no means a flawless film. By comparing to the remake it inspired, however,INFERNAL AFFAIRS seems much closer to perfection. If nothing else, I couldn't believe a Scorsese film would call for the audience to suspend their disbelief even more than what the average over-stylized & borderline-fantasy Hong Kong film would demand!!! There are gaps that THE DEPARTED manage to patch where INFERNAL AFFAIRS had fumbled: 1) watching the news report of Nicholson's goon as an undercover cop, and Nicholson responds 'the cops would want us to believe that so we stop hunting for our mole'. (this is where the HK version leaves audience confused as it is never explained; 2) the shrink actually is not a mannequin that shows the intelligence of an 8 yr old where her consultation with patients resembles an office receptionist taking calls -- flawed by not only the choice of actress, but also in the original script; & 3) why would Andy Lau's girlfriend get so disillusioned just BC she hears a tapped recording of a conversation between her boyfriend and a raspy-voice man about crime -- she doesn't even know he's working on this case, so why would this little thing lead her to believe her boyfriend is an undercover-crook?THE DEPARTED: done right: 1) as written above, Nicholson's comment on the police revealing who the snitch is helps lower unnecessary confusion that serves little purpose; 2) the psychiatrist has her own demons -- not a cyborg like Kelly Chen played it to be; 3) flashbacks to the children version of the leads were a good touch compared to INFERNAL AFFAIRS using actors in their 20's that confuses the audience BC they neither look like teenage versions of Andy Lau & Tony Leung, nor does it make sense for the difference in looks within even 10 years unless they've both had a FACE/OFF.THE DEPARTED - INFERIOR & RIDICULOUS: 1) is the psychiatrist a nymphomaniac? if so, why not explain that earlier that she could fall in lust with someone who just yells at her non-stop? At the clich√©d least, let it be an act of charity out of pity!One 'left-field' line of 'so can we have a cup of coffee?' after the rapid-fire insults would turn her on? Who's the one with dementia here? Why can't she at least have one scene where a problem between her and Matt Damon surfaces, or maybe she has demons she can't control causing her to fall in lust with Leo? Were there scenes or dialog cut from what was shot because of duration control? 2) when Nicholson's goon suspects Leo to be the snitch, why doesn't he tell anyone else? In INFERNAL AFFAIRS this is justified because the goon is a good friend and aspires to be like Tony Leung. In THE DEPARTED, there is not the slightest sense of camaraderie between these two. 3) when the girlfriend listens to the CD, her motivation is fear of getting caught by Matt Damon about her affair. Knowing so little of what Matt Damon's cases, why would she be so disappointed at him? If any reaction is to come out of her, it would at best be her questioning 'hey, are you taking up voice-acting? why didn't you tell me?' She wouldn't know what's going on just listening to 5 minutes of cryptic phone conversations... 4) Wahlberg, Wahlberg, WAHLBERG!!! I don't mind some of the lines given to him to make him the asshole of the year. I'll suspend my disbelief that much to accommodate his behavior. What I cannot accept is what happens after the boss' demise -- why would Nicholson and Damon suddenly feel the only remainder to their worries is Leo? When the film clearly states Wahlberg and Sheen are the only two who know the list of Undercovers, why does he suddenly leave the story as if he has no part in it? If I were the dumbest crook, Wahlberg is the first person I'd go for a shakedown to find out about the snitch. Instead, he is forgotten... and these are supposed to be the super-crooks we've been lead to believe throughout the film? MARTY... did you direct this picture? or you left 1/2 of it to the team of interns? I give points to the twist in the 3rd-act warehouse scene. It's a wise move to change-up so it wouldn't be completely predictable to those who've watched INFERNAL AFFAIRS. That said, what's with the ridiculous dialog? Leo: 'xxx you, xxx you, xxx you, xxx the lot of ya!' Is there some syncopation here? are you trying to add a musical touch to this scene? I won't giveaway your 'surprised ending'. That's better left for everyone else to judge after they see it. I for one, think it was ridiculous and could only have resulted because some Studio Exec decides 'but there's no redemption! The bad guy can't go free!' one more thing before I end this rant... it's about the scene with the Chinese gangs. Did you just grab a team of Chinese-looking men, tell them to translate on-the-spot their lines from English to what they think is Cantonese, and then just shot it right there-and-then without review? Do you realize they're speaking laughably bad pigeon Cantonese that doesn't exist -- intonation, and stresses at all the wrong places... when the gang head tells his henchman to check the bag, the audience expects him to say 'You better check it good my man! or it's your ass!'. What the guy says, however, can be translated into English as 'now I assign you the duty (in third person form as if he's explaining about an order someone else had made), you better check IT THOROUGHLY!' Would you put the stress in 'IT THOROUGHLY'? IT BAD, MARTY, IT BAD....",1,25,53,8 October 2006

Marriage Story," If FRIENDS had a spinoff, and Adam Driver was cast as Ross Geller...
","Flanked by an allstar supporting cast, watching this 135' reminds me of Woody Allen films that has comedic moments but end up a bittersweet story about breakups with people whose fundamental difference is Hollywood vs Broadway - it was perhaps never meant to be.At times, especially the scenes with the amazing Alan Alda, feels like Woody Allen comedy, and in other scenes with Ray Liotta & Laura Dern it becomes fiery courtroom sparring. While the acting is great by both Adam Driver and Johanssen, the bickering becomes overbearingly long-winded - as if a fun guest had over-stayed their welcome by making their host listen to the same joke and the only difference being how they lead into the joke... In the end, I feel the only things great are snippets of the two leads performance, and almost all the scenes with Alda, Liotta, and Dern, made me wanting more.This could have been a great bittersweet comedy about being in love while you cannot even like each other enough to break bread without fighting over small things like how to squeeze a tube of toothpaste. I can only blame the script and the director for this oversight. While the improv singing and end scene allowed Adam Driver to shine, this would have been a better story for Woody Allen or Whit Stillman to tell... in fact, probably Rob Reiner also would have made this better than the overrated flick it is.As to Best Actress performances for 2019, I'd say this one holds no candle at all compared to Renee zellweger in JUDY (2019), but I digress...",6,4,12,26 December 2019
