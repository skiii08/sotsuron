"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," This movie is tops
","I first watched this movie a few days ago and loved it so much I watched it the following night too!! The costumes are fantastic and the actors are amazing!! They would have had so much fun making this movie!!! This is now my new favourite movie and I would just like to add that this is not only because of the images of Felicia's (Guy Pearce) body...though it is mighty fine ha ha. The storyline of this movie may be unnerving for some people, but I think it really touched on some of the issues we are faced with today. I think that if more and more people watched this classic, timeless movie, it would get through to them that this attitude to people that are different is a waste of time.This movie is hilarious too!!Cheers",10,0,1,7 November 2006
