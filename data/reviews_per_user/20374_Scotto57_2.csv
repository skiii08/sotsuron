The Blair Witch Project," City folk get lost on farmer Smith's back forty Acres
","You either fall into two camps, you are someone who likes horror, and has a fear of getting lost in the woods, or you aren't. If, like myself, you don't get lost in the woods, then you'll find this movie to be dry, boring, and slow, with the only thing to do at the theatre analyzing the camera and editing techniques that the director has decided to use.If you, like so many, *do* have 'lost in the woods' angst, and also like the horror genre, then this film will be successful in drawing them out and taking advantage of them.All in all, one has to wonder, and admire how they have marketed this film and turned a low budget, practically home-made film about getting lost on farmer Smith's back forty acres into such a money maker.",2,0,2,5 December 1999
The Matrix," Not just special effects.
","Ok, I admit, after seeing the trailers and marketing hype to get me to the theatre, I didn't want to waste my time.  It seemed to be just another movie where most of the budget had been spent on special effects, and a few actors with name recognition in order to bring in the bucks.I had time on weekend, and a friend was interested, so I went anyway.  I was taken completely by surprise.Yes, there were lot's of special effects.  Yes, there was the set of actors there with name recognition.  But, to my surprise was a solid plot, and credible, solid acting to make it believable and interesting.Keanu Reeves stars as Neo, a computer programmer who is also a hacker finds that his life is not what it appears when a team of people, led by Morpheus(played by Laurence Fishburne) rescue him from Pseudo-Reality.The combination of a well written action adventure, with stellar special effects, great direction and cinematography and a cast that makes it believable and real makes this film the best action science-fiction movie since Blade Runner.",9,0,0,5 December 1999
