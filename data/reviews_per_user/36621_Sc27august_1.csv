Requiem for a Dream," Amazing work.
","This movie is one of my all time favorite movies, it is amazing. The way they portray the lifestyle these individuals live is down to the point. I really felt like I knew them watching this. It has to be one of the most realistic addiction movies out there. The characters made me think and almost have sharing thoughts with my own lifestyle. The music was perfect and set the entire movie to be touching. The fact that its no cheesy crap and its classical and light makes it heavier to the viewer. Elephant, the movie, was also like this... I think had the movie been filmed more so similar to that, it would have been most likely one of the best movies ever. Although I still have it in my top 5. I could watch this movie no number of times and not feel the same amazement along with the horror, shame, love etc that they all have. Many will look at this movie in disgust and see it as being horrible. Well then walk outside... unless you live in pleasantly this Sh** is everywhere and to most its everyday happenings, this just shows it in a way that most can bond to. I think the only reason people shun it aways is because they are too scared to call that into their lives because they know its true! All i can say is Amazing work!!Forever young yet wont live forever....",Null,2,4,3 December 2004
