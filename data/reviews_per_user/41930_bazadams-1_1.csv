Scarface," Can Movies Change Your Life?
","The main write-up on IMDb site for Scarface is woefully inadequate. I was born in Canada and have lived in 4 other countries in different parts of the world. I can testify that few films resonate as strongly with their audience (particular men) as Scarface. Why is this the case? 1: The acting- Pacino delivers the most compelling performance of the 80s in this film. 2: The script- Oliver Stone's true forte. In Scarface we find not only a brilliant story (first told in the 30s original, but with less edge) but also a surprising amount of humor, most of it wonderfully cynical. 3: The Violence- like it or love it, the chainsaw scene and the bloodbath ending in which Tony's fallen body emits a fountain of blood formed indelible impressions in the minds of viewers. 4: The Quotabilty- (related to point 2) 'Say goodnight to the bad guy; it's the last time you're gonna see a bad guy like this'. 'I'm not gonna shoot you Frank. Manolo- shoot this piece of sh#t.', etc. BRILLIANT!!!",10,0,1,13 September 2005
