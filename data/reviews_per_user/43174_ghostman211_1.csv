Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Is this what we expected?
","I was really looking forward to see this movie after seeing vol. 1 but it definitely didn't accomplish my expectations. Yeah, the story finally unfolds but when the movie ended, I realized that it wasn't so satisfying for me, compared to the rich and dynamic vol. 1. Yes, I think that the second part of the movie was kind of slow-paced...Next thing which disappointed me was, that: SPOILER!!!!WARNING!!!!SPOILER!!!! only one person died by black mambas handEND OF SPOILER that I kind of disliked after (in 'masterpeasely' way funny done) bloody prologue...and I'm not any gore maniac, believe me...And what I did like about the movie? Almost everything other :) So the movie is definitely worth seeing.Both vol.1 and 2 together: 8/10 Only vol.2: 6.5/10",6,1,3,10 June 2004
