"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," Funny, Bizarre and Disturbing all at Once
","This was a film that I had seen once before several years ago. It was riotously funny and heartwarming to watch at times. The film's over the top characters and acting made for campy entertainment.However, there are so many stereotypes here that I think it takes from the pro-LGBT message. The anatomically female characters are so horribly depicted that it made for some painful watching. That is with the exception of Marion (Sarah Chadwick), Tick/Mitzi's wife, who is lesbian or bisexual herself. Mitzi (Hugo Weaving), Bernadette (Terrence Stamp) and Felicia (Guy Pierce) have casino gig in Alice Springs, about 1800 miles from Sydney. Felicia purchased a hooptie bus that acted as a makeshift tour vehicle and christened it Priscilla. From then on, the film documents the adventures and travails of the trio until they arrive in the Northern Territory.Their first misadventure occurs when they go shopping and drinking at the Palace Hotel. The place was anything but a Palace. They encounter Shirley (June Marie Bennett), a scruffy looking woman who informs the trio that they are not welcome because of their appearance associated with their orientation. Bernadette in turn responds with some nastiness of 'her' own and calls Shirley a 'mullet' and tells her that the only satisfaction that she'll ever get is when she lights her lady bits on fire. Later on, 'Bernice' and 'Shirl' go toe to toe in a drinking contest, where she loses to Bernadette. The message here is: haters never win and a transgendered woman's as strong as any biological female. However, females have a lower tolerance for alcohol than males.There are other snags along the way such as the malfunctioning bus, which serves as a metaphor for the little engine that can. The 'girls' suffer anti-gay bigotry where Felicia is almost mobbed by a group of angry macho men. It is around this time when Bob (Bill Hunter) and Bernadette fall in love after courtship.I can see the moments where the film chastises people who do not allow others who are different to live and be themselves. These characters are so exaggerated, even for drag queen standards. This bold face type portrayal underscores the point that gays are often targeted for expressing themselves. The film shows how dull and unsophisticated conservatively minded people are.The only people who express empathy are the Aboriginals, whose names we never find out. In the film they're just desert dwellers who play along with the queens. The trio appear uncomfortable (especially Tick/Mitzi) being with the indigenous people. The reasons for this apparent discomfort are unknown, but there's the underlying message that native peoples are not seen in 'civilization.' These people behaved with more humanity than the other townspeople that they encounter until Alice Springs.Cynthia (Julia Cortez) was the stereotypical Asian mail-order bride depicted as a vulgar lunatic whose purpose in the film was like that of a minstrel character who has one special trick: shoot golf balls from her vagina. Bob justifies treating his wife roughly because 'she's always making a fool of herself.' In addition to this, Cynthia's a lousy cook. She can't do anything right, except for that one thing. Her presence in the film acts as a contrast to Ralph/Bernadette by sending the message that heterosexual relationships are a joke. Bernadette is portrayed like a better lady than Cynthia and eventually snags her husband, Bob. He also treats Bernadette much, much better than Cynthia. Bob's very fascinated to be dating a former Les Girl (showgirl). There are several instances where the film and characters negatively depict the female anatomy and personhood, yet these men have earned their living impersonating women and lip synching to songs sung by women. The male characters live unhappily because they appropriate and disfigure the same thing that they aspire to be: womanhood.The end scenes with Benjamin (Mark Holmes), Marion and Tick's son, as as heartbreaking as they are troubling. 'Benj' is a loving and understanding boy, yet he knows too much about his parent's intimate affairs for a child his age. He knows of his parents lovers and has a blase attitude about the situation with Mommy and Daddy. The scene with Benj sitting on top of a man's shoulders while watching Daddy Mitzi and Felicia's drag show was disconcerting. Children are not supposed to be in bars and casinos where adults drink, smoke, have sex and curse.Despite these things, I decided to rate the film 7/10 because this an honest and unsanitized look into the LGBT community. That helps me to better understand them and some of their issues. It's important to not sugarcoat things in order to make others feel better about themselves.",7,0,2,12 August 2014
The Hangover," It Really Felt Like a Hangover
","I rented this movie with an open mind. When it comes to movies, my memory can be fuzzy and all I remember when this film was released was that it was about a trip (travel and drug) that went awfully wrong. These characters had no redeeming qualities whatsoever. I suspect that the film's subtext is what the story is really about rather than the sophomoric antics that initially give the movie a comedic flair.For starters, Alan (Zach Galifianakis) is a registered sex offender whose sister is getting married to Doug (Justin Bartha), the groom. He even tries to make a pass at his unreceptive future brother-in-law, Doug. Doug suggests that a sexual relationship with Alan would be borderline incestuous and politely declines. There are scenes that suggest that Alan is into bestiality, is bisexual, and a drug addict with ties to drug dealers. Doug is the insipid nice guy who reluctantly accepts Alan into his circle of friends. Stu (Ed Helms) is a nerdy and spineless dentist with an Oedipus complex. His relationship with Melissa is that of mother and son, not future husband and wife. Out of all the men, Stu lost it the most during their drug and alcohol trip. He married a local stripper with a newborn and is very quick to turn his back on the morals he pretends to uphold. Phil (Bradley Cooper) is the quintessential pretty boy who is a douchebag. He is a grade school teacher who fathered a child with a married woman. Phil hates his job as a teacher and for the most part has no soul. His attitude really irked me because there are many men who are that way. He's the ringleader of the pack even though Stu and Doug are the ones with the money. I'd say Phil has the makings of a hustler; he pretends to know it all yet knows nothing and is more than willing to use your assets to make this possible.The scenes with Mike Tyson are crazy! There's a lot of symbolism in his role. The men literally chase the tiger (slang for cocaine use). Tyson, a man with a troubled history, plays the role of an avowed animal lover. The band of 'brothers' (in reference to Alan's failed blood brother ceremony atop the roof) behaved more like animals than the ones Tyson keeps. By the way, he was gently cradling a French Bulldog at home.Mr. Chow is highly stereotyped as an effeminate 'Chinaman' with 'small Chinese balls' who is also a homosexual. His presence was troubling and it was not due to his 'orientation'. The only reason why I gave this movie 3 stars was because of the beautiful images of Las Vegas. The cinematography's lovely in these scenes.Overall, my impression of this movie seems to be a closer look into the relationships of bachelors and the dark secrets that they keep. It feels like more of a black comedy if one looks at the film from this perspective.",3,0,2,30 August 2013
Pirate Radio," Pirate Radio: The Boat That Sank
","I was searching for movies about censorship for a class assignment. Fortunately, this film arrived at my library long after I completed my work. There was no chemistry in this movie between the characters. They do not inspire emotion from me good or bad, which is the worst thing that can happen in a movie. The conservative and female characters are one dimensional. Women take a backseat in this film unless it is to present their youth, beauty and of course, sexuality.I understand that films do not necessarily need to be completely accurate, but the portrayals do need to be realistic. What I got was every man's wet dream, young and hot women ready and willing to drop their panties no matter how ugly, grimy and fat you may be. Although the sexual revolution of the sixties opened up people's attitudes towards sex, the film portrays it in a flippant manner. There is a skilled way to present sex in a humorous manner without being disrespectful. I love sex jokes by the way. Unfortunately I had to stop watching this hot mess before I wasted precious minutes of my life.",1,1,3,4 September 2013
Silver Linings Playbook," What Silver Lining? Are These People 'Crazy' To Begin With?
","I just watched this film and the one pressing question that I had was were these characters really mentally ill to begin with? They described behaviors that are undesirable yet ambiguous. In our family's culture, Pat Jr. (Bradley Cooper) and Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) are not 'crazy'. This would be normal considering the traumatic events of both parties. Pat walked in on his wife having sex with the school principal and beat him bloody. Pat was mandated to stay eight months at a mental institution instead of being sent to jail. Pat comes from a comfortable enough family for them to pay an attorney to 'facilitate' this as opposed to serving jail time. Pat Sr. (Robert DeNiro) is a restaurant owner. Given Pat Jr's. predicament it is easy to see why the poor old man's broke.Pat Sr. appears to be OCD, but he's harmless. Yes, he does appear to have a gambling problem and the film made light of that which is troubling. Gambling addiction is just as bad as drugs just because there's no illicit substance in the middle. Robert DeNiro's performance is very humane; I felt empathy for Pat Sr.Dolores (Jacki Weaver) breaks my heart because I can see the pain in her eyes when dealing with the two most important men in her life with 'mental health issues'. Her voice is ignored and the men do whatever they want. She's the one who should be listened to. Tiffany's nightmare began when her police officer husband had just purchased her lingerie and was killed in a car accident on his way home. Tiffany's way or mourning was to sleep with every person that she could as a means to forget. While this may be objectionable to some, this alone does not make her 'nuts'. I have a social science background and this script and direction only portrays depressed people with some anxiety features (e.g. OCD) at best. Considering the circumstances, this could be temporary for some of them. Across other cultures, these people are relatively normal considering what's happened to them. So perhaps this is white American suburbia's take on what 'mental illness' really is.The film suggests that the mental health system seeks to stigmatize and institutionalize people who don't tow the line. Perhaps the reason why the cops came over to the Solitano residence regularly and did nothing was because they may have felt that Pat Jr. was just going through a 'rough time' after his wife Nikki (Brea Bee) left him for the school principal. This, in my opinion, is a reflection on the sad reality on the way some law enforcement handle matters of domestic violence. To this end I will not criticize the film makers.I do not like the way that Tiffany's character was treated. There were so many closeups of her breasts, hips and rear end. She's supposed to be seen as a grieving widow, even if she describes herself as a little loose. She was objectified through the lens of men as if she's asking for 'it' for being so sexual and having a hot body. Even Pat objectified her from time to time. In their final dance scene Pat practically simulates oral sex on Tiffany in front of the audience with his soon to be ex-wife, ex-sister-in-law, friends and family. Is the director trying to say that mentally ill people are so not with it that they would do something 'crazy' like recreate sex in public, that is exhibitionism? By the way exhibitionism is a paraphilia and not a mood disorder.The annoying kid who always came to the Solitano residence with his video phone to 'conduct' mock interviews and ridicule Pat Jr., Ricky D'Angelo (Matthew Russell), disturbed me. What a lack of manners. Even when I was that age I knew better than to bother others, especially people with 'issues'. This obviously shows that this kid has no culture whatsoever and who is responsible for that? That's alone to make anybody crazy.I could not understand why Nikki showed up the Pat's dance competition if she had a restraining order against him. Isn't she supposed to be scared? Also, would her new man approve of this considered that he received a bad beat down? Then, she even had an intimate conversation with her ex afterwards. Nothing in her looked like a domestic violence victim. This portrayal totally undermines the women who may be going through this for real. It was refreshing to see the director use racism as a parallel against the discrimination and that the mentally ill experience in the Asian Invasion scene. That was actually touching because Dr. Patel was one of the people assaulted, and he was a good source of support to Pat Jr.Although I am not from Philly, I spent time in Massachusetts and New Jersey, and there are things that I could definitely relate to. One of them were the bushy deciduous trees, traditional styled homes, Pat dunking a biscotti into his coffee, the passion for hometown football, late night diners, narrow streets lined with parked cars and antique looking schools. David O. Russell captured the nuances of these details perfectly. I just wish the rest of the film would have been more cohesive and compelling. I will say that the all of the actors are great in their own right, and each add their grain of sand to the whole plot.",4,3,5,7 September 2013
Jerry Maguire," First Rate Actors, 90s Clichés
","I will try to not parrot what has already been said about the movie, for better or worse. I have nothing against the actors of the feature film. They were the best of the best in that genre and generation. My issue is with all the product placement and overall marketing that the film is bombarded with ranging from Reebok, Apple Jacks, NFL and I don't know how many other products. If one is not discerning, one can fall for it and feel like ESPN is the ultimate authority in sports and that the NFL is the best thing that there is. I won't question the integrity of these entities because that's not what this review is about. The cameos from real life corporate executives further reinforced the marketing at play her. I just think that it would have felt more artistic and original to have come up with a pretend organization resembling the ones mentioned so that the viewer is not resold on the idea that big corporations truly benefit humanity and actually constitute a culture. For a movie about redemption and love, there is the underlying message that money and materialism is the agent that facilitates can destroy and redeem you. This may be true, and I am no bleeding heart; but movies should not always reinforce the obvious.One of the more positive aspects of the movie was seeing the Tidwell's as a normal and married black couple rather than bickering losers having illegitimate offspring. You could see Crowe's sensitivity and trying to elevate the dialogue without being soppy.I think what made this movie so zeitgeist was that it captured and incorporated the rampant and materialism of the 1990s. This decade was more greedy than the 80s because suddenly actors and athletes had the fattest paychecks simply for being entertainers. They suddenly became royalty. This decade was the beginning of the endorsement culture that blew up in the 2000s. The general public truly believed that bigger was better and resented being told otherwise. SUV's, designer clothes, limitless credit cards, supersized meals and Venti sized coffee's were almost a requirement.If you want to see a well acted film you will not be disappointed. I recommend looking at the movie with a grain of salt and detaching oneself from the underlying capitalist and elitist message that it sends.",5,0,1,11 February 2013
