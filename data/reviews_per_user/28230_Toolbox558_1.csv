Mission: Impossible III," Definitely a Bad Ass Movie
","Anybody who didn't like this movie must be deaf dumb and blind. The action was absolutely awesome from beginning to end. See it for yourself and don't expect an Oscar winning film. Expect good stunts and a lot of special effects. By the way that Dean character who said this was the worst film he's seen this year sounds like he hasn't seen many movies this year because i put it in the top ten blockbusters. Tom Crusie is still the man. Ving Rhames is still the other man. And the girls pretty cute too. So I'm gonna sum this all up by saying that mission: impossible 3 is 'Two Bad Asses, Three hot girls, and a lot of action'.
