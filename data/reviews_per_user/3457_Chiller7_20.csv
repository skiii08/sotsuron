The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Blandest movie-going experience in recent memory
","I casually enjoyed the first two films, but was not a major fan or anything like that. I thought they were watchable enough, watched them one time each, did not obsess too much about them and did not read the books; so, walking into this third film, I didn't have any sort of high expectations for where the story was going or what would happen to the characters - I didn't even remember any of the characters' names aside from Katniss, Peeta, and President Snow. I was just in the mood for some action. That's it. It's all I wanted. Just as long as there was some action in the movie, I would have been satisfied. But... this movie failed to deliver even that much!There was only one scene, involving some evil attack-planes, that can qualify as a genuine action scene in the entire movie, but even that sequence was rather short - in fact, the most exciting moment in that scene (and the whole movie) was one they'd already shown us in the movie's preview trailer, when Katniss shoots her arrow at the planes.The rest of the movie is just nothing but extended scenes that go nowhere, in which nothing much happens, dragged-out far longer than they needed to be. In fact, with our main character stuck in an underground bunker for most of the movie, almost all the action primarily happens off-screen. Whenever something potentially exciting happens, we generally don't get to see the action itself, just a bunch of people in a room staring at monitors.The movie also had a big problem with feeling repetitive, continually showing us scenes that establish nothing except what we already know. For example, the first time Jennifer Lawrence wanders through the wreckage and rubble left behind by an attack from the Capitol against the innocent district-dwellers, we get the sense that the Capitol is bad and they do horrible things and that Jennifer Lawrence is sad; we get the idea. But then later on, she wanders through another scene of wreckage and rubble in another long-and-drawn out scene. And then we get yet another scene just like that! We get it already! How many times do you have to establish that the Capitol are the bad guys and that Jennifer Lawrence is sad? Hurry up and get on with it already!But they don't get on with it. It just keeps dragging on and on until by the time the movie ended, I found myself asking: That's it? The movie's over already? Really? But nothing happened yet!Without having ever read the books or knowing what's going to happen next, even I can tell that they did not need to split this chapter into two segments. Instead of this dull, unnecessary episode, I'm sure there's no reason they couldn't have just squashed all the events of this film into the first act of the final film.What a disappointment.",2,8,11,26 April 2015
Deepwater Horizon," Simple but effective disaster movie
","This is a good, if narratively very simple, disaster movie. All the usual story beats of a typical disaster movie are here: we're introduced to the characters, then we wait in suspense for the disaster to happen, and then it's all exhilarating explosions and peril and the struggle for escape and survival until the end. Simple but effective.We can forgive them for keeping it simple though, because it's a true story, so there's only so much they can embellish. There's no room for a much more intricate plot than what we see here. Indeed, I'd say this movie is the most interesting if you have some personal interest in or memory of learning about the real story back when it happened. What makes this movie engaging is knowing that this story really happened and the characters in the movie are real people (who in reality look nowhere near as attractive as the actors chosen to play them, amusingly enough). Otherwise, it's just a well made, but fairly standard disaster movie.Personal BP anecdote: I was a geology student when this story happened. In 2011, one year after the incident, I attended a presentation by BP representatives who came to my school to recruit geology students. They gave a presentation on 100 years of BP's company history, during which they gushed all about all of BP's accomplishments throughout the century. But conveniently for them, BP was founded in 1909, so the presentation ended at the year 2009. Not a single word was uttered on the disaster and oil spill. Anyway, I thought that was amusing.",10,0,3,17 December 2016
Terminator Salvation," The best of the franchise aside from Terminator 2
","I'm not the hugest fan of the Terminator franchise. I watched them all long after their original release dates, watched most of them no more than once, and I watched them out of order. I finally got around to watching Terminator Salvation the other night, to finally see the last one of the franchise that I had yet to see, and... it was great! Probably the best one of the franchise aside from Terminator 2.And yet, critics and the fanbase attacked this as one of the worst? What? I don't get it. Goes to show that angry fanboy attitudes extend beyond Star Wars prequels & superhero reboots. Try something a little different and the so-called fans will revolt...I liked seeing a war-against-the-machines movie set entirely in the future, with no time travel storyline. I liked the intense action style, shot with hand-held cameras, like you're on the ground with the soldiers in the middle of a warzone. I liked that every robot and war-machine, from the machine-gun toting Terminators to the sleek black motorcycles to the giant mecha ones, had dangerous and a threatening presence.The Sam Worthington storyline was intriguing and unique. Is he still a man or a machine or what? If I had to complain about anything though, it's that Sam Worthington's accent noticeably slips into distinctly non-American on more than a handful of instances throughout the movie.Anyway, it was all pretty cool. What's not to like?",10,4,7,26 November 2017
Suicide Squad," Fun factor trumps its few flaws
","This is a fun-filled, action-packed movie with all sorts of eccentric weirdo characters and story elements and outrageously exaggerated over-the-top performances. My theater audience was laughing the whole time. I was laughing. We had a great time. We loved it and so will you, unless you're a curmudgeon.Plot/storytelling: On a surface-level, this may seem like a typical simplistic super-hero movie story - big threat arises, our 'heroes' must work together to stop it. But to look at it that way may be missing the point. This is a movie where what's technically the main plot of the movie is less important than the individual stories of the characters themselves, and their backstories, motivations, interactions, etc. It felt like at least as much, if not more, of the movie was devoted to their backstories as on what they're currently doing in the movie, which felt almost less important. It's an interesting approach to storytelling. I liked it.Action: Pretty good overall, except for some flaws. This is not Zack Snyder-style meticulously choreographed smooth artistic action, but instead, a lot more chaotic, standard Hollywood-style action quick- cuts, especially towards the end, when it may have gotten a bit all over the place. Here's where I'd normally knock a star or two from my rating, if the overall fun didn't boost my rating back up. In general, the action/fights in Suicide Squad don't reach the superb quality we saw in Man of Steel & Batman v Superman, but at least this movie doesn't do the annoying shaky-cam thing, a la Batman Begins, Captain America: Civil War, the Bourne movies, etc. where you can barely see anything in the a lot of fights. The best action moments go to Harley Quinn, easily.Characters/Actors: Deadshot: Best Will Smith role I've seen in a long time. You will feel for him and his sad story. You will laugh at his sarcastic remarks. You may wonder why a guy with guns would be on a super-powered team, until you see what he's capable of, and then you will be in awe. Harley Quinn: This may be the most perfect comicbook to film casting choice ever. Margot Robbie embodies this character completely and she steals the show. I've been a fan of this character since Batman the Animated Series of the 90s and Margot nails this role.Joker: This one's interesting and may divide opinions. Here's something I noticed: this is the first on-screen Joker to not have an upward-rising red smile actually painted onto his face. For the first time, he's actually able to frown and give other intense expressions. He's totally creepy the way he instantaneously switches back and forth between intense and grinning expressions. I'll say, I loved this Joker, even if there were many Joker moments seen in the trailer that seem to have been cut from the movie. I wanted to see more Joker in this movie.Enchantress: One of the weird unexpected characters you'd only get from an unusual movie like this. She's like she came straight from a horror movie. The most visually impressive effects in this movie are for the Enchantress's magic.Amanda Waller: I've seen some complaints about the villain of this movie should have been better. I don't know what they're talking about, because Viola Davis as Amanda Waller was intense and intimidating. She will scare you. Other characters: Everyone does such a good job, even if they don't all get nearly enough screen-time.Other thoughts: An unusual number of scenes from the trailers didn't make it into the final film. I can only wonder why, because the ones that I noticed were missing seemed like fun and interesting moments. Without knowing what was originally in those scenes that were cut though, we can't really judge whether cutting them worked out well or not.I like what these DC movies have been doing and I like where they're headed. They're not afraid of pulling inspiration straight from the comics giving us something different than what we usually see on screen, instead of following the tired old movie formulas. Keep it up, DC. I look forward to Wonder Woman (2017).",10,3,11,7 August 2016
Doctor Strange," Spectacular effects, bland plot, recycled Marvel formula
","My background knowledge going in: I was first introduced to Doctor Strange in the 90s Spider-Man cartoon. Mary Jane joined a cult, so Spiderman had to get assistance from Doctor Strange in order to save her. Those were some of my favorite episodes. Good stuff. I've also seen Marvel's 2007 animated Doctor Strange movie, which was very good.The good: This movie's visual effects are amazing. Warping space, time, and reality has never looked so trippy. Watch it in 3D - it's worth the ticket price.The bad: This movie sticks so close to Marvel's tired formula that it also suffers from the same shortcomings as Marvel's other movies (bland villains, jokes per minute that often feel forced, unnecessary girlfriend character, world-ending plot that somehow never feels like much of a threat, underwhelming climax) and ultimately unfortunately feels kinda bland. I hate to admit this as a fan of the Marvel movies, but this felt overly predictable and full of recycled elements in a few too many ways.Characters: Isn't Doctor Strange himself essentially the same character as Tony Stark/Iron Man? From his personality (talented but arrogant), to his backstory (rich showoff whose injury leads to humility), to his penchant for making sarcastic jokes and pop culture references, they're almost the same guy.The villain and world-ending plot of this movie, you've seen already in numerous other Marvel movies. How's the underdeveloped bad guy and his world-ending plot of this movie different from the bland bad guys and world-ending plots of Thor the Dark World, or Guardians of the Galaxy, or so on?Dr Strange himself feels like the only character with a fully fleshed out personality in the movie. No one else seems to have enough of a personality to be understandable. The villains, in particular, had no personality whatsoever. And Dr. Strange's allies were a bit too baffling to make much sense. I understand they're supposed to be mysterious people, but as soon as we learn a little bit about them, the movie moves on, so we never quite get to know them or their motivations. This becomes a problem when they start to play bigger roles in the main plot, even though we still don't really know them and who they are as characters. And the romantic interest was weak. She was oddly played for laughs more than as a serious part of the movie. The joke was she's unusually underwhelmed and unimpressed by all the magic. It's amusing, but if the movie won't even take her seriously, it's hard to seriously believe that these two are in love at all.Music: Michael Giacchino is usually a talented composer, but I have to call him out here; he may be getting a little lazy. His theme for Doctor Strange sounds way too much like he simply copied and only slightly modified his own Star Trek theme. They sound very similar. Who let him get away with this?Inconsistencies: Lots of apparent inconsistencies with the rest of the Marvel movies here. Maybe the Marvel Cinematic Universe is getting too big for its own writers to keep up. The timeline of events in this movie don't quite match up with the other movies, notably the Doctor Strange reference in Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), which was an exciting easter egg back when we first saw it, but now makes little sense.Final thoughts: This is a movie that's generally fun, enjoyable, effects-filled, and action-packed, but it's a movie that plays it very safe and ends up rather formulaic, instead of daring to do much of anything to surprise you. Marvel has a formula that works for them and the success of their movies can't be denied, so you might ask why fix what's broken? But this is the 14th Marvel Cinematic Universe movie so far, and the old Marvel formula's getting a little repetitive. I'd like to see them take bolder risks and go in more unexpected directions than what we got here.",7,2,6,14 November 2016
Justice League," Very entertaining from start to finish. A good addition to the DC universe.
","This is a fun, thrilling, and thoroughly entertaining ride that never stops moving along at a brisk exciting pace, full of a cast of super cool & likable heroes. Director Zack Snyder's well deserved reputation for masterclass quality spectacular action and visual imagery is on full display here with the constant onslaught of large-scale epic action & fight scenes.Highlights: -Wonder Woman's first action scene was ridiculously awesome. -The big action sequences involving the Amazon warriors were pretty epic. -A scene taking place at the memorial park was extremely thrilling (enough said!).Do not miss the experience of seeing this on the big screen! That said, there are a few caveats that aren't significant enough to affect my score, but I feel should be mentioned.-Lots of shots seen in the trailers somehow didn't make it into the final movie. Without knowing why those shots were cut, it's hard to tell if this is a bad thing, but it definitely feels like there's potentially a longer (maybe better?) version of this movie out there with additional scenes that we didn't get to see.-The big bad guy, Steppenwolf, was just kinda... bland. He's a fairly generic two-dimensional villain with limited uniqueness or depth, you know the kind whose whole story and personality can both be summed up with simply that he wants to take over and/or destroy the world. Before you cry foul at why this doesn't lower my rating for the movie, it's that at least his action scenes are still really good, especially his super-thrilling fight against the Amazon warriors - that was a big highlight of the movie - so that at least makes up for what's lacking in his story and personality.-Danny Elfman's Batman (1989) & Batman Returns (1992) musical scores from back in the day may have been legendary, but his work here was... serviceable at best. Something was missing. This music served simply to set the mood of the scenes, but I didn't find it particularly stand-out or memorable. I'd say it lacked the epic vibe and distinctive themes and raw emotion evoked by the other DC movie composers, Hans Zimmer, Junkie XL (Tom Holkenborg), Rupert Gregson-Williams, & Steven Price. He also repeatedly samples bits of his own past Batman music and John Williams's Superman music, which is questionable, considering how long Hans Zimmer has been composing so many superb DC Batman & Superman themes (since Batman Begins, 2005) and doesn't even get a nod here.Anyway, that said, watch it. I highly recommend it! Oh, and screw the critics and their snobby attitudes, as usual. If anything, pay more attention to overall audience ratings, such as right here on IMDb, for a 100x more honest consensus than any critics' ratings.",10,3,9,20 November 2017
The Shining," Overrated
","Once again, I decided to check out a highly regarded 'cinematic masterpiece' and was left kinda disappointed. Scariest movie of all time? No, not really. It wasn't even particularly scary.Admittedly, a lot of it was well done. The little girls were the best part. They were great. The steadicam shots through the hallways were pretty cool. There was a good sense of 'What horrors could be lurking around the corner?' as the camera follows the kid through the halls.But aside from those things, much of the movie didn't work so well. Jack Nicholson was more hilarious than menacing. Was that intentional? His witty dialogue provided many laughs, but watching him slowly stumbling around holding an axe was hardly what I'd call horror.The story was completely nonsensical. What was any of that? There's no explanation for almost everything that happens in the movie! Here's where I'll probably get derided by the movie's fans for not 'getting it,' but I'm convinced this is really a case where the movie-makers themselves had no clue what it all meant. They just threw all this random imagery at us just to confuse us and convince us that it's actually brilliant (because if we can't comprehend any of it, it must be brilliant, right?) but really it just makes zero sense.I don't get why this is so highly rated.",5,83,128,31 July 2015
Captain America: Civil War," Stop shaking the camera
","Shaky-cam + rapid-edits + zoomed-in-too-close tight-angle-shots = the worst style of action/fight scene. This movie is plagued with this excessively shaky camera style. Frankly, I don't know why viewers tolerate this kind of thing. It looks horrible. I prefer to actually see what's going on during a fight scene, to see the fighting moves the stunt performers are pulling off, and not feel like I'm having a seizure. Let's count the Russo Bros directed Captain America movies among the worst offenders of this style, alongside the Taken and Bourne movies. I blame the directors, the Russo Bros, because the first Captain America movie in this series, Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), which was made by another director, actually did not have this problem. That's why the action scenes in that movie are so much more watchable than in Winter Soldier or Civil War, both directed by the Russo Bros. To be fair, the visual effects shots in this movie actually look fine. I'm convinced that different people were in charge of the effects-heavy shots vs the hand-to-hand combat shots, because whenever there are a lot of visual effects onscreen, the camera doesn't suffer from the shaky problem; for instance, when the visual effects-heavy characters (Iron Man, Spider-Man, Ant Man, etc.) are fighting, it looks fine. It's when the hand-to-hand fighters (Black Panther, Black Widow, Bucky, etc.) are fighting that we're subjected to excessive shaky-cam and choppy editing. Stop shaking the camera, please!",6,0,1,5 June 2018
The Conjuring 2," Liked this even better than the first
","I don't get scared by horror movies, but I've enjoyed this series because of the emphasis on likable characters, from the family to ghost-investigator couple. These are good stories, with believable relationships between family members who care about each other, not simply a bunch of jump-scares (although there's that too).As good as the first one was, it was narratively a fairly simple & straightforward haunted house story. I'd rate this one, the sequel, a little bit better because, although featuring a similar premise, it actually goes in a few unexpected directions and introduces additional hurdles for our protagonists.This one also clearly has a bigger effects budget, which doesn't hurt. Many of the effects are really quite creative and visually impressive (e.g., a girl slowly transforming into someone else the unfocused/blurry background); but also some that look a bit more silly than scary (e.g., the Crooked Man).",10,0,0,16 September 2017
District 9," Not just great sci-fi action, but also dark comedy
","I just watched this movie again for the second time - the first having been when it was first released in theaters. It's been long enough that my second viewing felt fresh.I remembered an exhilarating sci-fi action movie, but what I'd forgotten and stood out to me this time was that this movie is loaded with hilarious dark comedy. I found myself laughing throughout at the movie's twisting of what are supposed to be horrific events into funny situations - for example, the main character's casual indifference to the cruelty of his job, from evictions to abortions(!), and his nonchalant reactions to horrors happening in front of him, such as an alien chopping off someone's arm, or all the people who explode upon being shot by alien weaponry. Oh, and the scene when the main guy is trying to order a burger and sees himself on the news and sees what the media has been saying about him - hilarious!There's even a certain dark sense of humor in the movie's overall themes, and its portrayal of everyone on all sides as horrible people, from the anti-alien (racist) citizenry, to the corrupt and evil government officials, to the violence-addicted soldiers, to the ignorant and clueless family members and co-workers, to the aliens themselves as mostly inept slum-dwellers, too incapable to do anything to get themselves out of their predicament, and of course the obscenely ridiculous Nigerians. Some people found some of these portrayals offensive, but I'd say it's all so exaggerated that it's funny. It's been a few years since Sharlto Copley's career took off, thanks to this movie, but this guy has yet to disappoint in his acting choices. I've liked everything I've seen him in, so it's great to rewatch the movie that launched his international stardom. This guy deserves all the praise for bringing this role to life, one that doesn't actually portray him simply as some cool hero, more typical of a sci-fi action movie, but instead thanklessly starts him of as a sort of a useless bumbling doofus, who then changes all the way from desperate and pitiful to badass all within the span of the movie. This is the kind of performance that deserves awards.I continue to look forward to whatever Sharlto and director Neill Blomkamp are up to in the future.",10,0,4,6 November 2016
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Like the old ones, but even better
","I'll admit, I walked into the theater half-expecting this to be the dying gasps from this long-running franchise. But instead I found myself hugely entertained by this fun spectacular adventure. This is an enjoyable movie.I'd even say this installment just may be my favorite one of the franchise yet and here's why. The positives of this franchise, the huge spectacle, silly humor, and grand sense of adventure, also tended to be bogged down by its convoluted & confusing plots & mythology.But by now that we've reached this movie, it feels like they've smoothed out all the old defects in the formula, so to speak, and the result is a streamlined pirates movie, retaining all the elements that worked in the old ones, while simplifying some of the excessive plot details that tended to bog down the old ones. So while this movie doesn't necessarily feel like something new, it does feels like we're getting the same formula from all the way back to the first movie but improved.And I actually quite like that Jack Sparrow is a character who hasn't evolved one bit throughout this 14 year franchise. He's the exact same buffoon from the first movie. It's like he hasn't learned a single thing or changed at all in any of these movies. This may be the most brilliant thing about this franchise. That's why we can have this movie, so many years after the first one and still feel so much like nothing's changed, because the story really hasn't even tried to have him change as a person. And that's a good thing, because we can like his character as he has always been.",10,1,4,24 September 2017
Mulholland Drive," It's confusing nonsense, but that's not necessarily a bad thing
","This is a movie that essentially pulls the rug out from under you and gives you the middle finger when you're down. It's deliberately confusing and baffling, full of plot points that apparently go nowhere, disjointed vignettes that are entertaining while they last, but leave you wondering how they're possibly connected to the rest of the movie at all, and mysteries with no explanation. I kinda like this movie, because weird nonsense like this - stuff that makes you ask 'What the hell is going on? - appeals to my personal tastes, but I'd totally understand anyone else who hates this movie and doesn't understand it at all.",10,3,5,16 September 2018
Don't Breathe," The Stephen Lang show
","Stephen Lang is such an impressive, intimidating-looking guy. At his age, he can still overpower and beat up a bunch of 20-something year old kids to a pulp on screen and do so perfectly convincingly. This movie relies entirely on his performance as the scary antagonist and he does so very well. That alone is enough to recommend this movie.But that's not all that deserves praise. When this movie gets going, it's non-stop action and there's a natural flow and logic to the action too, which may seem like an unusual thing to praise, but it's more than we can say for a lot of other lazier thriller movies, where the victim characters make the dumbest possible decisions only to be picked off. I'd say this movie does a pretty good job of avoiding such clichés, because in this movie the characters make reasonable decisions for their own survival all along the way. If they go a certain direction, it's because it actually seems like the best way to go. If they get stuck in a dangerous spot, it's because they had no better choice. The characters in the movie actually managed to outsmart me, the viewer, at certain points. Their decisions to get out of certain perilous situations were actually pretty clever, leaving me thinking, well if that was me, I'd be dead.Anyway, this is an effective thriller movie that's actually more fun than it should be, mainly because Stephen Lang is such an impressive presence on screen, that you'll actually enjoy seeing him every time he shows up, even though you're supposed to be afraid of him.My only question is shouldn't the Blind Man's house at least have a workout room full of weights and exercise equipment? How else would this man stay in such superb shape?",10,12,26,18 December 2016
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Simple dumb fun, which could be good or bad, depending on your tastes
","The *Marvel formula* is back. By now the famous Marvel formula has been so successful for the Marvel movies that not only do they not have any reason to ever surprise us by giving us anything new, but they're actually doubling down on the weaker aspects of their formula: Interruptive jokes, underdeveloped villains, and the same old recycled plot where the world/planets/dimensions are threatened, but despite the massive scale of events, things never actually get serious enough for any viewers to be afraid the heroes won't save the day, and even before it's over, you already know that the inconsequential events of this week's episode will probably be by wrapped up by the end credits and forgotten by the time of the next Marvel movie.Marvel must have some sort of mandate to never let any of their movies go for more than a couple minutes at most without another interjected joke. It's like they deliberately pepper in jokes to desperately avoid ever taking themselves too seriously. It's gotten to the point where it's not natural humor anymore; they just have to constantly interrupt the flow of the movie to insert jokes - and, in the case of this movie, not even particularly witty jokes, but extended juvenile back-and-forth conversations about nipples, penises, and turds... I wish I was making that up. But despite all of the above, I'm not saying don't watch it. If you watch it expecting nothing beyond simple dumb fun entertainment, which is what it is, then you might enjoy it.",6,3,9,20 August 2017
The Conjuring," Simple but good haunted house horror
","Horror movies don't scare me and this was no exception for me personally, but I can still appreciate a well made movie. And I guess this movie was pretty effective at what it sets out to do. The premise is almost as simple as a horror movie can get, a pretty basic haunting story, but it moves along and builds up the tension at a good pace.The paranormal researchers are an interesting touch, with the psychic but susceptible wife, and the husband who's more in control, but lacks his wife's supernatural senses. I really liked them as protagonists.If I had one complaint, it's that the dad of the family in the house seemed unusually calm and underwhelmed much of the time. I'd expect him to freak out a little bit more, seeing his family in danger.Anyway, I found it pretty enjoyable, even though I don't get scared by horror movies.",10,1,1,10 September 2017
Wonder Woman," Continues the DC's streak of superb superhero movies
","DC's superhero movies have yet to disappoint - despite up until now being relentlessly targeted with negativity by a weirdly obsessive contingent of haters, fanboys, & critics on the Internet - this latest movie in the DC lineup no exception. DC movies really are modern mythology brought to life, aided by spectacular action visuals, coupled with epic music, these are the best movie experiences that the modern superhero genre has to offer.This latest DC movie, Wonder Woman, keeps up with the exceptional quality of the preceding DC movies in all aspects. Wonder Woman's spectacular action scenes look and feel very much like the ones we've seen in Man of Steel & Batman V Superman - director Patty Jenkins impressively managed to maintain the same action style as action-genius director Zack Snyder did with his films. Wonder Woman's musical score achieves a similar beautiful, epic quality to the work of previous DC musical master-class level movie composers, Hans Zimmer, Junkie XL, etc.I am thankful for DC movies taking themselves seriously and elevating themselves within a genre that can tend to be content with being merely shallow fluff entertainment. Wonder Woman, along with DC's other movies, prove that you can fully commit to bringing modern epics to life on screen.",10,12,30,21 June 2017
Shrek," I can't forgive this movie for making me suffer
","Back when I was in high school, when this movie came out and somehow became popular, my teachers in three separate classes coincidentally all decided that letting the class watch Shrek for a day, instead of doing anything involving learning or teaching, would be a fine way to pass the time. Consequently, I had to suffer through this movie three times. At least the third time was in my web-design class, so I at least got sit an a computer browsing the Internet while the movie was playing. No, I'm not kidding. This is how your education tax dollars were being spent. Only in America. Anyway, I hated the movie all three times. It's a bunch of ugly, poorly animated cartoon characters acting rude and crude. If you find this kind of thing funny, good for you, but such lame-brained humor is just obnoxious to me. Shrek got hit in the nuts while sliding down a slide! Am I supposed to laugh? An ugly cartoon character is saying inappropriate things in Eddie Murphy's voice! This is supposed to be funny, right? Other people seem to love it, but I was just annoyed.",1,4,12,6 April 2016
Mother!," I'd hate movies if every movie was like this. But this is good because there's nothing else like it..
","This is a movie that deliberately breaks all the accepted rules on what theatrical release movies should be. It's a movie that made me ask 'What's going on? Why is this happening?' the entire time. If most movies are like this one, I'd probably hate going to the cinema. But because it's so weird and there's nothing else like it, that's why it's interesting.I walked in knowing nothing except what I saw in the trailer. I figured it was just gonna be Jennifer Lawrence's character going crazy, but that's not what it was about at all. If you knew before you went in what this movie is supposed to be about and what it all means, you'd probably have a very different experience. Your experience watching it wouldn't be as nonsensical. But I'm glad I watched it knowing nothing beforehand.The whole thing is allegorical and everything in the movie is a metaphor. But I'll admit, I didn't realize what any of it meant while watching it. I had to look up the meaning afterwards and then it all came together, what the movie's story is alluding towards the whole time. Oooohh, of course, now I get it.",10,4,10,27 November 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Some movies are too big for little minds (especially critics)!
","This is a movie that does not hold back. Too many other recent franchise sequels played it too safe and, as fun as they were, let's admit, kinda underwhelmed as a result of not daring to do anything new and different (e.g., Age of Ultron, Jurassic World, Force Awakens). Movies deserve commendation when they go all out with their bold choices, even if not all of those choices work, rather than rehash the past. Batman V Superman is a movie that is not afraid of going all out crazy.Action: Even if you dislike every other aspect of his films, you can't deny that Zack Snyder is a master-class level action director. His sense of timing, cinematography, and choreography, and his visual style have never failed to impress. Snyder always makes sure we see what's going on during the action and never subjects us to excessive shaky-cam & rapid-fire edits, like too many other modern action movies. His superb Watchmen fight scenes got me wishing: 'If only Batman could fight like that,' and sure enough that's what we're getting in BvS.Past Batmen can't compete. Past stiff batsuits barely allowed movement, much less convincing fights. Nolan's Bale-man movies did many things well, but the Dark Knight trilogy fight scenes left a lot to be desired. From the disorienting rapid-edit can't-see-what's-going-on fights of Batman Begins & Dark Knight to the clumsy haymaker-heavy brawls of Dark Knight Rises, Batman hadn't really ever been allowed to truly fight like Batman... until now.Pacing: This is a movie that recognizes that we already know these characters and does not waste any more than the bare minimum amount of time reintroducing them to you. Call it underdevelopment if you want, but I say that's absolutely the right choice. We've seen Batman and Superman before in other versions, so it's fine to dive right a world where Lois and Clark are already a couple, where Batman has been operating for years, & where Superman is already known to the world. This movie jumps right into the plot and the pace never gets slow or tedious.Themes: Gods among us. How do we deal with them? These are deep concepts, with real world connections. For instance, how often do people with power get blamed for bad things, regardless of whether they are at fault? Can we leave power unchecked and simply hope and trust it doesn't turn on us? These are certainly bigger ideas than simple popcorn fluff such as 'Ultron is an evil robot' on which to build a movie. Take that, Marvel :P Seriously though, the epic scale that the DC movie-verse is reaching for is nothing short of ambitious. Beyond simply guys in costume punching each other (yes, there's that too), this is a movie that gets us thinking about grand questions.Fan Service: As a DC fan, I was pleased and surprised by all the straight-from-the-comics elements in BvS. In addition to the Dark Knight Returns, it also took inspiration from other DC sources, classic and new, such as, among others, from the old Crisis on Infinite Earths, to the new Injustice: Gods Among Us, and the Arkham Batman video games, as well as other notable classic DC series that I won't mention to avoid spoilers. This is definitely a movie for the fans, but what impresses me is that it was so willing to go full fan-service, even at the possible expense of casual audiences who may be not so fluent in the DC Universe lore. In fact, most of the complaints I've seen about how some parts were confusing, or incoherent (notably the dream-sequences), or plot holes, were really direct references to the comics that as a fan I can see what they're doing right away, but may be baffling to casual audiences. I'm sure these things will be explained in the upcoming sequels though. Keep in mind that there's a big difference between intentionally cryptic content that will probably be explained in the sequels and actual plot holes resulting from sloppy writing.Cast/Characters: - Ben, Gal, and Henry: Awesome. - Mark Zuckerberg, oops, I mean Lex Luthor: This casting was the most perplexing one when it was first announced, but has turned out to be quite inspired. Of course, there could be no better modern interpretation of a diabolical businessman/mad-scientist than as an obnoxious young tech mogul as smart as he is smug. Who better to cast in this role than Facebook's CEO himself?! - Lois: a character who's traditionally been very annoying is not so in this version. No complaints here. - Perry White: Who says anything about no humor in this movie? Perry's hilarious. - Martha: Who says this movie has no heart? I dare you not to get emotional from her scenes. - Alfred: This Alfred is not a butler, but more of a partner. Bruce even brings Alfred coffee. That shows the respect between them. Alfred's constant quips remind me of the Alfred from the animated series (again, who said anything about no humor?), but minus the whole awkward master servant relationship. Great modern take on this classic relationship.Music - Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL's score: Beautiful, haunting, and bad-ass all rolled into one. Love the lietmotifs. When Wonder Woman's electric cello kicks in, prepare for pure amazement to follow.Highlights: - Batman vs. room full of bad guys: Holy $#! THIS is the Batman we've always wanted to see! - A single-take action scene in a desert setting that's as visually spectacular as it is bizarre. Some people call this moment confusing, but I say just sit back and enjoy the visuals, because it's awesome. - Seeing the DC Trinity together on screen... I'm in DC fan-heaven!Final thoughts: I've never watched any movie more than once in theaters. But I'll definitely watch this one again. Good job, Snyder. Bring on the Justice League!",10,10,31,2 April 2016
The Godfather," Overrated by critics and old men
","I don't see why this is supposed to be one of the greatest films of all time. I think this is just another one of those cases where everyone's convinced themselves it's so great only because the pretentious critics told us it is, and you're so afraid of being considered a philistine that you go along with it, telling yourself, yeah, this really is a masterpiece, even though you were bored by it too.The movie's pretty boring. None of the characters are likeable. All the big moments of the movie build up to nothing more than 'Let's shoot him' and then they do. That's it. That's all that keeps happening throughout the movie, in between long drawn out dialogue scenes. And the story's not even told very well - so many long conversations that don't really convey anything of any significance; so much pointless stuff happens that doesn't really add to anything to the plot.The movie dumps like 20 characters onto us all at once at the wedding scene at the beginning of the movie and then expects us to keep up with which Italian guy is which for the rest of the 3 hours. I constantly had to pause it to search on the Internet for their names to figure out who they're talking about, which ones are Al Pacino's brothers, which of them are family, which are his in-laws, who is not related to the family, who works for the old man, who works for the rival families, etc.I'll give this film 1/10, not because it's quite that bad, but because it's been severely overrated and deserves to drop down a few stars.The one good thing here is the music is good, I'll give it that.",1,5,26,22 September 2018
