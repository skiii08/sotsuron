Lucky Number Slevin," Boring and predictable
","I heard a lot about this movie so I decided to see it. I was wise enough not to buy the one, I just rent it, but still was prepared for a couple of hours of breathtaking experience on my sofa (at least from what I heard from guys at rental store).What I got was a great disappointment. While movie starts as a mystic thriller and action unveils in a mystified dark way, the watcher expects to see the underlying reason, or the driving force of it. He sees nothing. Intead, the sheer revenge is all they have. The connection between Bruce Willis and the young guy (Slevin, or whatever) is the worst outcome the one can predict. And the sea of blood the two of them make becomes just boring. This is all in addition to numerous clich√©, that film has in abundance. One out of one.",1,18,41,4 January 2007
