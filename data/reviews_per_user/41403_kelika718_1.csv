Requiem for a Dream," Amazing Life Like Must See Film!!
","This is an amazingly life like film that shows the harsh reality of what drugs can lead to. I am in no way against people using drugs, you will do what you please in order to make your life good for you, as seen in the film. However, after watching this I know there are a few things I would never get myself in to. It deals with the real issues of drug use, not people wanting to get high and have an amazing experience, but the pains of addiction and how far some people go to feed theirs. However, through it all underlying lessons can been seen rather than just drugs. Even if it does show the sad reality of drugs, it's a must see and very easily a movie people can relate to. I strongly suggest watching it no matter what your feelings toward drug use is. Also if you like this movie, I recommend watching Spun, as well as the director's first film Pi.",10,0,1,25 June 2005
