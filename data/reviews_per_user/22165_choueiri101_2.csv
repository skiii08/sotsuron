The Lobster," Avoid.
","Concept and potential of movie is high; Actors played their role well but that could not help the film. You'd be sure to avoid this movie, the 7.6 rating it currently has is astonishing. How it would get past three stars is mind blowing. It drained so much from me watching this movie. Unfortunately after going past the half way mark of the movie i had to finish it......and i got there thinking the movie was three hours long. I'm taking the time here to type as much as i can to post this comment to help you fellow IMDb followers to give a more accurate movie rating. I do understand that people do have their own likes and dislikes however i would easily speak for the majority and say please avoid. kind Regards and always looking out for your mental welfare.",1,75,132,16 December 2015
The Witch," Avoid.
","It had potential. whether it was a case of lack of budget for the film production or just bad directing; the story was good however was lacking any a lot of areas. the scenery chosen was fantastic and acting was good also. the combination of the actors/actress working together was also a good selection. The voice of the father was prime for the film that gave an extra feel for the movie. His voice alone warranted one of my three stars for the film. That's pretty much where the niceties stop. It did not draw the audience in, at least not this viewer. i long for a good suspenseful armchair gripping scary movie which do not come all too often. after completing the movie, well i expected more.",3,4,8,9 May 2016
