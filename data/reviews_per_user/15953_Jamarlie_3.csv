The Expendables 2," I couldn't finish the movie due to laughing too much
","I guess if you are into that kind of movie it's pretty okay. Don't get me wrong, it has potential. Great actors, a lot of explosions, not too much story, a lot of fighting scenes, blood, Stallone's mustache still looks like someone drew it on his face with a Sharpie, pew pew, boom and you know the drill. Not much to say about modern day action movies, they all consist of the same irrelevant two-liners that the protagonist blurts out whenever they do something the audience could consider to be 'cool'. They all consist of the same pseudo-love story and pseudo-deep dialogues about the meaning of life and how you should appreciate it when they just finished painting the floor with someones brain seconds ago. I would literally have to elaborate on a few scenes so you get an idea which movie I am actually talking about because it literally mirrors everything every action movie does. It doesn't do worse than it's fellow colleagues, but it doesn't do better either.BUT! There is this ONE THING... ONE THING that made me quit the film after a good 60 minutes because I was in the serious danger of getting a cliché-aneurysm. It is the villain of this movie. I don't know why and I don't know how, but whoever wrote the script needs to be send into perpetual vacation. The antagonist of this movie is apparently a mixture of Satan, Hitler and Stalin himself. I just want to recap the thought process that the director of this movie might have had to show you what I mean:'Hmm, I need a movie villain, what does he need? He obviously needs to be a self-gracious, smeary d*ck that looks a bit like he was cut out of the Matrix-movies. When you see him, he has to scream 'ARROGANT CLICHÉ VILLAIN' and 'ABOUT TO DIE A HORRIBLY PAINFUL DEATH TO SATISFY THE AUDIENCES SADISTIC TENDENCIES'. How could we achieve that? We could do the usual villain stuff. You know... dealing with Plutonium for weapons of mass destruction (as if he wasn't aware that no matter how much money he has he is still gonna suffer the consequences of nuclear radiation lol, who cares about movie logic anyways), being all greedy 'n stuff... OH OH OH! I know: We are gonna introduce a useless baby-face looking hottie for the ladies that this guy is gonna execute in the most painful way possible 20 minutes into the move for no apparent reason! He obviously has to be so full of himself that he literally is about to bust a nut. But is that enough? He needs a despicable, ruthless right hand to assist him. That guy should be some sort of Asian... but Asians are usually not the bad guys... uhm... RUSSIANS! It's an Asian looking Russian! Damn this is such a great idea, why has nobody ever come up with that before?!But I still don't hate him enough... I KNOW! He could be letting people work in a mine until they die, just like in a concentration camp. And if the audience is still not convinced enough that he is going to suffer a cruel and painful death at the end of this film for being so utterly despicable (despite the obvious stamp he has engraved onto his forehead that exactly states that) he should just casually say something like: 'If we don't have enough men, bring the women and children and let them work in the mines too.'Well done! I just created a guy that is literally less likable then Hitler himself! What could he do next though? Bite off the head of a cute bunny... oooor should he eat a soup with noodles in swastika-shape while reading 'Mein Kampf'? Maybe he should just blow up an orphanage for deaf-mutes to make him the literally least desirable person on earth.Do you want him to be dead now audience? Please say yes, he impersonates everything that you connect with the word bad...'This is flat out the single worst character-design I ever had to see in a movie. This guy is, in no bloody way, convincing whatsoever. I am just happy they didn't give him a dumb name like 'BadGuy' or 'Villain' or... oh wait. His name is bloody f-ing 'Jean Villain'?! ......Nope, f*ck that sh*t, I'm out. Taking the cliché-train to Clicheton.(Thanks to IMDb for repeatedly auto-correcting the name of the antagonist! He is spelled with one 'l', not with two. Even IMDb didn't think that someone would come up with such a bad name for an antagonist...)",6,0,0,18 August 2015
Memento," A 'must see'!
","This is one of the few movies that you just have to have seen. There is no way around it, you just have to. There is literally nobody that I have shown this movie to who didn't immediately like the plot- structure(and I have shown it to quite a number of people). The movie goes backwards and basically starts with the end, a murder. You then consistently go back in Leonard's memories, always rewinding a piece as if you actually were the protagonist himself. The best thing about this is: You never know what happened previously, just like Leonard doesn't. You have to figure. That's what makes this an incredibly good movie on it's own right, the creative story telling and the integration of Leonard's condition of not knowing anything that previously happened. But the end is just the cherry on the cake, literally a mind-blower you can't possibly expect when watching this movie the first time. All in all, great plot, amazingly good actors, amazing storytelling, creativity and a great and unpredictable ending. This film is enjoyable from minute one to 113. Even if you watch it 5 or more times (as I have done) it just doesn't get boring. Definitely excellent!",10,0,2,6 September 2015
Furious 7," ... I wasted my time...
","...and I wasted a lot of it. I gave this movie a go since everybody was starting to bug me about it. 'OH THE ENDING IS SO GOOD U MUST SEE IT!' was probably the reaction I heard the most. This somewhat raised my expectations to an absolute all time high. I sincerely thought I would get a quality movie-twist ending the likes of 'Who Am I', 'Memento' or 'Fight Club'. So I started, and not with F&F 7, but with F&F 5 to catch up with the story to make 100% sure that I get the full enjoyment out of this so praised 'really good movie'. After a 4 hour marathon of all of testosterone pumped explosions, boring races and muscle packed action I finally got to the main course: F&F 7. The movie couldn't get any better for me when I saw one of my favorite action-actors, Jason Statham, being in the cast as well. When the credits started to roll in after another two hours the only thing I said to myself was: 'Someone owes me my mother****ing 6 hours back, and I want them back right now.'To conclude it in a more polite way: This movie is not bad. But it is not good either.*Spoilers begin here*The ending, at least for me, started with a fighting scene in the old warehouse. At that point of the movie I was so bored that I sincerely tried to figure out when Paul Walker passed away and at which point he started to get doubled. In the end I expected some kind of huge twist, which was probably the thing that pulled the entire movie down for me. That twist never happened. You see the two protagonists cruising down a road next to each other. Paul Walker smiles, takes a left turn, camera turns in the sky, 'Rip Paul', credits. WHAT. This literally showed me that the people who actually said this movie had a great ending never saw a good movie in the first place. I felt absolutely scammed when that ending came up, hell, I even watched the entire credits to see if something story-relevant would happen afterwards... My mind was repeatedly saying to myself: 'Have I been watching the WRONG movie? Did people talk about a different movie with a cool ending?' This does not mean that the ending was not fitting, that means that the ending was way below what I expected. But then again, maybe my expectations got a little over- hyped. And don't get me wrong here: The movie was not bad. It had some funny moments, some nice special effects (although jumping through 3 skyscrapers with a high torque car is more comedic than realistic), it has an okay story line for an action movie (Aka, the uber-cool protagonists, the muscle packed human tank that is never shy of a cocky statement, female... let's call them 'charms', a villain with an unbreakable will to be evil and a load of explosions) but then again, this is about what every action movie since the year 2000 has. There is nothing new to be found here, the only difference is that those explosions can now be enjoyed in 1080p, big bloody whoop for that. All in all, an average action movie which does not differ in any way from any movie. The only thing that actually makes this movie so popular is the sudden hype around Paul Walkers death, an actor who was literally of no interest to anybody before his death and who suddenly turned everybody into whining fans of a movie sequel they never watched in the first place.",6,1,14,29 June 2015
