The Avengers," Avengers is an Ant; Batman is a Boot.
","This film is overrated. Critics are calling this the best comic book based movie ever and I'm just not feeling it. To use an analogy from the film, Avengers is an Ant, Batman (Nolan's version) is a Boot.The positives of the movie are the humor (lots of LMAO moments), the action scenes and I just love seeing these heroes on screen.The big negative was the plot, particularly the plan and motives of the antagonist. It didn't make sense why Loki needed an army from another realm to conquer earth, when he seemed to be doing fine on his own with that staff of his and manipulating people. While Loki seems to have no problem traveling back and forth to earth and other realms, why can't the space army use the same worm hole he uses? The rules of the game are unclear. Why is it that Loki can blast Captain America's shield and knock him off his can, but when Thor strikes Cap's shield it seems to have less impact on Cap than Loki's blast? How is Thor's hammer able to hold down the Hulk, but when the hammer is laying inside SHIELD's ship, it doesn't drag the whole ship down or fall through the ship? When Thor is trapped inside that room falling toward earth, why can't he use lightening to open it up? How does Thor, when he is supposed to be cut off from earth after the events in 'Thor', know that Loki took the cube and just happens to drop in on the ship where Loki's held captive? How is it that Nick Fury can touch the cube in the beginning of the film, yet we see in 'Captain America: The First Avenger' the Red Skull opens up the cube by touching it? In fact, why is Loki going through all this trouble to open up the cube when Skull seemed to do it effortlessly? While the rag doll scene was funny, how is it that a god with all these magical powers can be slammed around by an earthly creature and affected by Iron Man's blast? Yeah, the government has this brilliant idea of using nukes to protect the rest of the world without even thinking about firing nukes inside the worm hole where the threat is coming from.This film is good if you turn your brain off. I found it funny, enjoyable and exciting to watch. Although I was glued to my seat and will probably get it when it comes out on BluRay, I am not eager to see this movie in a theater again.So this is far from the best comic book movie ever made (I saw Nolan's movies multiple times in theaters). It lacks any depth and originality to claim that title. Maybe it would at least be arguable had they plugged all the plot holes in the script. Batman is the boot that steps on the Avenger ant. There's The Dark Knight, Batman Begins and then everything else.",9,1,6,4 May 2012
Alien vs. Predator," Okay, Could Have Been Better
","This movie was okay, but it could have been much better.Let me start with the bad news:1. Predator Vision Should have used infrared (red & blue), not orange. Plus the was not much sound at all.2. Character Development Terrible. I felt like we only get to know 2 or 3 characters in the movie (Lex, Sebastian, Weyland). Since the movie was too fast, Anderson should have spent more time developing the other characters. I just got tired of seeing humans getting picked off and not knowing their name, motivation, etc. 3. Killings As mentioned above, humans got picked off too quick. I wouldn't even know half their names if I had not read the book and the IMDb credits.4. Cinematography Camera was too quick.5. Score Sounded awful at key moments, like the first Predator death scene. Also, sounded really corny when Predator showed his face to Lex. I thought they were going to kiss or something.6. Fight Scenes Only like 2 or 3 Alien/Predator fight scenes. Since this is an AvP movie, there should have been a lot more. Maybe if he'd of stuck to 5 predators and didn't make them get killed so quick, then we would have more fight scenes. 7. Contradictions In Alien 3, were learn that Aliens don't kill humans who are carrying alien embryo. We know the Predator is carrying one, but aliens try to kill it, and eventually do. Lex said that the cold could freeze you in 3 minutes. But she seemed to be out their with the Queen a lot longer than 3 minutes.8. Flat Out Ridiculous If Predators can see aliens inside of humans, then why the f*ck would they bring a dead predator on board their mothership when he has an alien inside it?If the water is frozen, then how the heck can the Queen drown so deep?Now the good news:1. Plot Thought it was decent and interesting. Could have been better if the movie was longer to allow the tension to build up.2. Shifting Pyramids The claustrophobia adds to the suspense. But again, the movie was just too short. They could have extended it. For instance, when Verheiden and Miller were trapped, Verheiden should of at least killed some of those aliens.But here is the kicker. Despite the disappointment that this film was, the audience actually clapped at the end. I am not kidding, no one walked out like I hear others did in other theaters. The question is, were they clapping because they were entertained or were they clapping because it was finally over?In conclusion, Anderson sucks, f*ck you Fox for ruining my summer and 14 years of anticipation, but it was okay.",6,0,0,14 August 2004
X-Men: First Class," Good, but let's not get carried away . . .
","Overall, this was a good action film featuring characters I enjoyed and cared about with an adequate story. This movie is being overrated as giving The Dark Knight a run for its money, as being the movie of the year, movie of the decade ... seriously? First Class (FC) is no Dark Knight, no Batman Begins either. I honestly can't say right now whether I enjoyed Thor or X2 more than FC (I'll have to watch them over again before deciding that). One problem with this movie is that it is a prequel, rather than a reboot. The flaw in having a prequel is that you already know what is going to happen in the end like what is going to happen to Xavier, Magneto, Mystique, etc. Prequels also risk creating continuity errors, which there are when compared with the other X-Men films. They should have just made this a reboot rather than a prequel. With the franchise hitting the gutter with X-Men Origins: Wolverine, a re-imagining of how the X-Men and arch-nemesis began would have been appropriate. James McAvoy's performance as Xavier was great, but I found it odd that Xavier has hair throughout the entire movie. Also, it wasn't quite explained why Xavier chooses to use his powers in certain situations and not others. There are other plot holes too like when Shaw says you're either with us or against us, kills Darwin, but doesn't go after the other mutants that didn't choose to join him. Or with Shaw's powers, why does he need a nuclear war, why is he waiting 18 years to carry out this plot, why not just absorb energy from a nuclear reactor or power plant and just start destroying mankind himself? These aren't the only flaws and I'm not going to list all of them. I'll just conclude by saying, despite its imperfections, I enjoyed FC. It, like Thor, will probably make my Blu-Ray collection along with the other X-Men movies. Clearly it is better than Wolverine (which sucked, but that's a story for another day); yet it's no Dark Knight nor Oscar contender for best film either. As much as I loved Fassbender's Magneto, I didn't get a best supporting actor vibe from his performance.",8,0,4,3 June 2011
X2: X-Men United," Good, but still room for improvement
","The special effects were great, especially the opening scene with Nightcrawler teleporting through the White House while kicking the Secret Service.Favorite scenes include that one as well as Magneto's break out of prison. For X-Men fans, this is a good movie.From the ending, it looks like the next flick will jump into the Phoenix Saga, but what about the Sentinels, Bishop and the future, Juggernaut and Apocalypse?The only criticism that I have has to do with discrepancies and the powers of the mutants.For instance, Wolverine is supposed to have the ability to smell people. But he kisses Mystique in the tent scene as if she were really Jean Grey.Rogue, in the comic books and the TV series, has the ability to fly and is very strong, but she has yet to display those powers in the films.Also, the Iceman should appear like a human block of ice.",8,0,0,8 May 2003
