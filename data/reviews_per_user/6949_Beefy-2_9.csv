Vertigo," Wow. Very wow!
","This is my 2nd favorite Hitchcock movie after North by Northwest.  It is a combination of all the elements that make his movies great.  The acting, the use of color and the cinematography, the music, the story that grabs you in the beginning and doesn't let go.This movie is perfectly cast.  I'm not sure, but I think there are only 4 characters who appear in more than 1 scene.  Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak really carry this movie in their large roles.  On repeat viewing, after you have learned the truth about the Kim Novak character the first time, her performance gets deeper and deeper.  What a spot to be in, to be in love with the one person that you have to convince you are someone else.  Barbara Bel Geddes is also good in a small role.  Jimmy Stewart is great as always, but perhaps better than usual. His performance reaches an emotional level that few actors can.  He was absolutely amazing.I thought the picture quality (VistaVision + Restoration) was beautiful!  I think this is quite possibly the loveliest movie I have ever seen.  Every shot seems so perfect.  The way the green reflects on people's faces, and that beautiful but sad graveyard... and the scene where Stewart kisses Novak, and is suddenly reminded of kissing her in the stables... WOW!  The dream sequence was brilliant too.  I also liked the 'vertigo effect'.  You really feel the way Jimmy Stewart does in that bell tower.Bernard Hermann's score is one of his best ever.  The way some things are accentuated is great - like whenever the vertigo thing is done, and the love theme when Stewart and Novak kiss passionately in her hotel room is compelling to no end.  His next three scores (North by Northwest, Psycho, Marnie) are also very good.  Perhaps this score was the one that showed the character's emotions the best and it fit the film perfectly.The story was great.  The first time I saw it, I was thinking - this is kind of weird.  She's possessed by her great-grandma?  But after watching the whole thing and rewatching it, I realized how great it is.  And the way it's directed really fleshes out a wonderful screenplay.  Anyone who is going into film should watch this movie and learn from it.  It has a special place in the annals of movie history.It's a wonderful mystery, drama, love story, gripping suspense, a series of beautifully filmed images, and one of the best films you could ever treat yourself with!",Null,1,2,8 April 2000
Spartacus," Wow!
","A slave/gladiator starts a revolt against Rome and incredible odds.  Watch the restored version!This movie was astonishing.  The score was excellent, as were the cinematography and acting.  I wasn't sure what to expect of John Dall and John Gavin but I was pleasantly surprised by all.  Laughton and Ustinov are very good and Olivier's Crassus drips with evil.The drama is so compelling  - you empathize with the characters so much!  I cried during the 'I am Spartacus' scene.  And at times, Tony Curtis seems like this little boy who needs to be loved and wants so badly to help Spartacus that you just can't help but feel for him.  And I don't blame him for running away from his master.  If Olivier's Crassus came on to me, and told me to serve Rome (an analogy for himself?), I'd flee too.The supporting actors are great too.  Charles McGraw was very hatable, and the Roman 'nymphs' (Nina Foch and Joanna Barnes) are such a fine example of the vain, idle rich.Although this isn't the most Kubrick-ian of Kubrick's films, probably due to Kirk Douglas' and Anthony Mann's influences, it is one of the best historical epics ever, and is a total treat to watch!",Null,3,5,28 January 2000
The Killing Fields," Moving and timeless
","This touching film is (the true story) about journalist Sydney Schanberg and his Cambodian interpreter Dith Pran.  Caught up in the chaos of the American bombings and the Khmer Rouge, Pran eventually has to struggle just to stay alive.This movie deserved every Oscar it won for its year (1984).  The cinematography is excellent.  First, Cambodia is photographed as almost a paradise.  Then, we see the horror of warfare, also stunningly photographed. It looked so realistic, that for a moment, I felt like it wasn't a movie, but a documentary.The acting is top notch as well, especially from Dr. Haing S. Ngor and John Malkovich (in his screen debut).Everyone needs to see this movie at least once.  Although it might be a little disturbing, the violence is not gratuitous.  It only adds to the story and emphasizes the tragedy.  Despite the tragic elements, however, the movie is inspirational.  One of the best films to come out of the 80s!",Null,3,4,16 August 2000
North by Northwest," Hitchcock at his zenith
","In my opinion, North by Northwest is the high point in Hitchcock's career, a Mt. Everest of film making with another high peak on each side - Vertigo and Psycho.This is one of the most perfect movies I have ever seen - full of plot twist after plot twist, the most interesting characters to ever grace the screen, and marvelous set pieces.As soon as the movie begins, we are thrust into the life of Roger Thornhill, who we spend almsot every scene of the movie with.  We know at once that he is a conniving adman, but under it all, he is a nice guy, and about the most sympathetic hero of any movie.  The bad guys are as evil as they come, and Eva Marie Saint may not be Grace Kelly, but perhaps that makes it better. Audiences may not have accepted Grace Kelly in that role.The setpieces.... so great!  the Hotel, the UN, the TRAIN!, the auction scene, and Mt. Rushmore are all great, but none are quite as superb as the cropdusting sequence.  I've seen the movie at least 5 times, and I never realized that it's kind of gratuitous until I read a comment about Torn Curtain and gratuitous characters/scenes.  That's how well this movie works - everything seems right and nothing seems out of place.  Even the one noticable blooper - the kid who put his fingers over his ears before the gunshot - it doesn't tarnish the movie at all.I understand why Ben-Hur won 11 oscars for the year 1959 - it was an epic film and it is done well, but North By Northwest was the best movie of that year, if not the entire 1950's.Cary Grant was the coolest guy ever and is the quintessential 'everyman'. That on top of every aspect of this movie being perfect makes it Hitch's most appealing work.  It doesn't break new ground, but it is so brilliantly conceived and executed, that it is no wonder it is on so many top 10 and top 100 lists.  Everyone should see this movie more than once.",Null,1,2,31 March 2000
American Beauty," A gorgeous satire
","American Beauty was my pick for the best film of 1999.  Every aspect of film making came together to make this movie great.The script is darkly funny and is a very biting satire of all of us suburban middle class folks.  In fact, I was a little scared when I could compare the characters to 'normal' people I knew.The acting was excellent.  I can't imagine anyone other than Kevin Spacey in the role of Lester Burnham, who goes through a midlife crisis and wreaks havoc with the lives of everyone around him.  The three young stars: Thora Birch, Mena Suvari, and Wes Bentley delivered on target performances.  They add just the right amount emotional depth and pathos to save their characters from becoming the caricatures that they could have.  Chris Cooper is the fascist neighbor, and an underused Allison Janney is his submissive wife.  In a small comical role is Peter Gallagher, providing a foil for Annette Bening, who plays Spacey's wife.  Bening's performance was perhaps the most widely criticize, but I thought it was excellent.  She has been accused of being over the top.  Of course she was over the top.  That was the image of success her character was trying to project constantly, but when she stops projecting that image, we see a human side that is very touching in the film's final sequence.The film has a good message about what beauty is, and Spacey's closing monologue brings everything to a close wonderfully.  If the inevitable had come a half an hour earlier, it would seem less tragic, but that extra time gives the audience a chance to 'look closer' and empathize with each character, even Chris Cooper's.Also of note, is the beautiful cinematography.  The use of color is striking, especially in the surreal dream sequences.  This film definitely deserved the oscar it received for cinematography, as well as the other four oscars.So, if you want to see what everyone has been talking about, you should see American Beauty.  **** out of ****",Null,0,0,10 July 2000
Dirty Dancing," Great fun!
","This movie isn't deep nor is there anything that stands out as being technically astounding, but this movie is a fantastic, fast-paced feel-good movie.  The mid 80's has some great films that have cult status today and this is one of them!It is the simple story of how Baby (Jennifer Grey - looking as great as ever)and her family vacation in the Catskills where the ultra-cool dance instructor's partner gets pregnant and he needs a new partner. 
Of course, the instructor is Patrick Swayze and you know where the movie is headed but it is such a joy to watch the story develop and the end is perfectly fitting for the film.  Not to mention an excellent score that is a combination of 60s and 80s songs.And almost every character is memorable: Lisa - the skanky sister, Neil - the nerdy grandson, Tito Suarez who has the funniest look on his face when asked about sheet music, etc. Virtually every scene is memorable too, especially the 'Do You Love Me' scene, the log/water scene, and the final dance number.  Perhaps my favorite moment is when Patrick Swayze bashes the car window and it is only raining on half of the screen when he picks up the post.The point is this: Watch this movie - alone, in a group, on a rainy day, on a Sunday afternoon.  It is along with Ferris Bueller's Day Off, one of the best movies of the 80's!",Null,1,1,5 November 1999
The Insider," Well filmed and scripted
","This was a very intelligent film, whose script neither condescends or patronizes its audience.  Russell Crowe was very impressive and Al Pacino was great as always.  Plummer also did a nice job as 60 Minutes' Mike Wallace.However, there is more to the film than the fine performances.  The filming is well though out, painting a cold uninviting picture of America.  The cinematography was the second best of the year, topped only by American Beauty's rich colorful portrait of suburban life.  This movie was almost Kubrickian in its realistically icy style.  No sentimentality here, folks.I would really recommend this movie.  It's a little longer than your average film, but there isn't a wasted moment.  The approximately 2 hrs. and 40 minutes will go by quickly.  If you want to watch a movie that appeals to your intelligence, watch the Insider.   *** 1/2 out of ****",Null,0,0,10 July 2000
Rosemary's Baby," Astonishing!
","This movie is absolutely breathtaking.  Mia Farrow is so easy to identify with.  There were times when I wanted to scream at the characters on the screen.  That is how well-acted this movie is.  Some parts may seem a little campy by today's audiences but for me there was not an unreal moment. Ruth Gordon definitely deserved that Oscar, as did Mia Farrow and John Cassavettes. I absolutely loved that Scrabble scene.  I found myself thinking 'Come on, Rosemary! Figure it out!' This is my favorite horror movie.",Null,0,1,31 October 1999
The Shawshank Redemption," One of the best
","I saw this movie for the first time a year and a half ago.  I liked it, but I didn't remember how much until it was on TV today.  Everything comes together so well at the end, and on repeated viewing, there is a whole new level to it.Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are both exceptional in their roles.  Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a convicted murderer who goes to Shawshank Prison where he is befriended by Red (Morgan Freeman), who has already served 20 years there.  Despite the hardships of prison, Andy refuses to lose hope, and he tries to inspire Red to feel as he does.I can't think of one scene that was wasted.  Everything helped build to the movie's conclusion.  Every character was important, as was every line of dialogue.I actually cried at the end.  This movie really makes you think and touches your heart.  Next to Pulp Fiction, the best movie of the 90's.",Null,0,0,20 August 2000
