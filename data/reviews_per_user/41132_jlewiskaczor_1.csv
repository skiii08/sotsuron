Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Ouch
","The Phantom Menace may quite possibly be the best movie I have seen in years. George Lucas really hit the head of the nail on this one. The introduction of new characters as well as a new look on old ones was a refreshing breath of air. The iconic and widely adored Jar-Jar Binks makes his premiere in the epic motion picture, where he en-captures the viewer with his awkward appearance and lovable personality. It is quite a treat to see what kind of mischief the clumsy Gungan gets himself and his friends into.The movie overall is a cinematic masterpiece where one can hardly tell what is CG and what is not because it is all so realistic. Arguably the most stunning scene is the battle between the droid army and the Gungans. As the two forces clash, with blaster fire and blue balls whizzing through the air, one can truly get lost in the battle and may even develop PTSD as a result of the graphic and realistic battle scene.A definite highlight of the movie is getting to meet and know Anakin Skywalker, a young slave boy who is related somehow to another character in the older trilogy, however the connection isn't made very clear and it could easily have lost a less avid Star Wars fans, but trust me when I say he for sure is related. Anyways the young Anakin is possibly the best character in the movie, and the youngnes of the character did not detract from the story or anything, glad to see the Lucas's brilliant movie making mind did not make a mistake there. It was very easy to connect to the character as he is an 8 year old slave boy from a desert planet, nothing hard to relate with there.",1,1,5,12 January 2017
