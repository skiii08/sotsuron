The Blair Witch Project," A Horror Film Where Fear is The Real Monster
","In the 1999 horror classic 'The Blair Witch Project', we see three aspiring young filmmakers in 1994 set out on journey to do a documentary project based on a mysterious urban legend of the Blair Witch, who resides in a forest outside of a small town in Maryland. At first we're given the impression that this film was based off of their raw footage. The research going into the documentary is pretty shoddy in execution. The camera is purely out of focus and plus that Heather (Heather Donahue) repetitively utilizes 'u-huhs and yeahs' when she's asking questions towards the residents in the area. The opening scenes will surely make you gnash your teeth in annoyance. In fact this whole movie within a movie can be contrived at times. But once the young students enter the woods in search of the Blair Witch, the annoyance becomes more paranoiac as the fears and the anxieties start to send chills down our spines. Fortunately, the real filmmakers (Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez) were not as inept as the student filmmakers. We get some believable settings as the determined crew makes their way into the Maryland forests, where they are lost and the more trapped they are in the labyrinth of tress and shrubs, the more the adrenaline level goes up rapidly as the fears and paranoia become overwhelming. The daytime scenes start off quite equivocal as just the sounds of twigs from tree or on the ground snap can surely garner scares where expect the unexpected becomes focal in our minds as much as theirs. The rock piles that bear a resemblance of grave markers epitomizes a sense of unsettling tension of the students as though their eyes are playing tricks on them. These supernatural elements that the threesome face would likely drive anyone insane. The daytime fears seem pretty tame at first because the paranormal activity doesn't generate as much fear as the gang might shed some hope of finding their ways out of the woods, if they could trace back to where they begun their journey. When night comes and when things go bump in the night, the fear factor really gets the boost. The strange sounds nearby can be chillingly frightful and our brave but naive, unequipped students can do nothing but stick together. But nightfall the horror party finally gets tense and the audience watching this can feel this level of fear that anyone sneaking up behind them in the theaters can get someone a cardiac arrest. The forest is black, the theater is dark, everything is painted black during these scenes. The main prop in this movie is the cheap first-person camcorder which eventually becomes a character in itself as we become a part of this movie courtesy of the camera as well as the terror the gang faces it lingers on us as well as we feel convinced that there might be a Blair Witch lurking in these forests. These camera traits show adults that it is normal that human beings are scared of the dark and nothing shameful about that. The lack of preparation when entering the woods, the students have been faced in a sort of predicament they can't seem to get out of and the more they struggle the worst it gets. When Heather the booger- dripping leader of the team she confesses that it was her stubborn ways and determination to finding the truth she begs her cohorts Josh and Michael for forgiveness, we actually feel for her without the audience feeling manipulated.'The Blair Witch Project' is utilized as a staple on why we're obligated to watch and let alone produce films. When the students start to get restless, hungry and feared, Heather decides that now's the time to close the camera. Finally, the more restrained Joshua takes her camera and retaliates by pointing it back at her and shouting back at her as though, the camera rules her life while it affects the other two characters caught in the middle of the mess she put them in. In some ways this movie helped spawn shows like 'Ghost Hunters' and 'Ghost Adventures' where paranormal experts go around the world in seek of the truth in that there is life beyond our mortal lives.",8,2,5,21 February 2016
Despicable Me 2," A Sequel That's Just As Fun As The First
","The original 'Despicable Me' was a rather eccentric, but quite an engaging family film. In the original, we see Gru (Steve Carrell) as an evil doer who's master plan was rob the moon. The antagonist in the movie was even more deranged and diabolical. In most animated cartoons, the heroes come across as cute and timid characters who come out on top in spite of the dangerous obstacles they must prevail to emerge victorious. Gru on the other hand has a more anti- hero characteristic rather than the typical soft fuzzy heroes we loved over the years. I guess this kind of characteristic in find a darker toned character as the hero was the reason why this film fared so successfully at the box office; along with the Minions mind you. 'Despicable Me 2' may have been one of those not-needed sequels, since in the end of the first one, Gru does become nice. With his ability to utilize his evil savvy as an advantage to service heroism contributes the movie to work its way this time around.The movie starts with Gru living peacefully with his three adorable daughters Margo (Miranda Cosgrove), Edith (Dana Gaier) and Agnes (Elsie Fisher). Believing that he's lonesome with no companion in his life, but seems ardent at times when they start looking for companions. One day, Gru gets captured by an undercover agent of the Anti-Villain League named Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wiig). The AVL depends on Gru to ascertain a possible fiendish criminal genius who's coming off as an owner of a shopping mall store. Gru declares that the villain is El Macho (Benjamin Bratt) a man who appears to be almost unbeatable. He has invented a concoction that provides for him super-strength and has arbitrarily tried it on some of Gru's Minions.Even though Gru is more of a protagonist, it's still wonderful that his edginess wasn't completely watered down. He still get easily cantankerous towards people who irritate him which includes his three daughters. He still has the knack for being evil and the film takes great pride in proving that point. One of the better scenes is when Gru tries to outsmart El Macho and pinpoint his next moves beforehand. This kind of methodology is what keeps this film true to the original even if Gru is not as despicable as he once was. The storytelling elements in this film are the main weakness here, just like the first one. The narrative is way too loose contrary to other animated films of this generation ('Madagascar' and 'Frozen'). I think 'Despicable Me 2' had the potential to pitch more ideas over with Gru striving to become more adept at pushing his heroic integrity even further. There are moments midway in the film that drags a bit at times. and even though the Minions are cute, their functions tend become at times lacking in significance. Every so often these little guys need some moments to themselves (thank goodness for the summer spin-off movie this year). I would be lying to your faces if I told you the Minions were not the best things in the movie. In fact every time they're on, they put a big smile on my face. They really are quite magnetic. Sure they might distract the gist of the movie, but they're just too adorable and funny to neglect. Some of the more funnier scenes was when they morph into purple demon-like critters. I guess the film- makers knew how immensely popular the minions were so they added more just to please the viewers. And surely they didn't disappoint. They're manic and crazy antics will surely have you laughing out loud till your head explodes. The Minions weren't the only funny ones here. Gru is exceptionally funny as the leading hero and El Macho makes one hell of an exciting villain. He kind of reminds me of Carlos from 'Hop' that has morphed into a sumo wrestler. The characters are very delightful in it creation and the visuals are just simply stunning. 'Despicable Me 2' isn't the best animated movie out there, but it's still offers lots of humour and warmth for a family film the whole family could enjoy.",8,1,1,11 October 2015
Moneyball," Keeps You Enthralled By The Heart Put Into This Film
","Year in and year out, I always get a lump in my throat when I see a sports underdog story about a team or player who must claw and scratch their way to insurmountable odds to be the best that they can be. Sure they're inspiring and heartfelt in its intentions, it seems like it follows on a routine outline that has been emulated over and over and offers anything new to the story. And granted 'Moneyball' doesn't attempt anything new to the underdog sports story, but it's execution to the phenomenon from a contrasting perspective. Based on the non-fiction novel by Michael Lewis as we are more inspired by the business side of the baseball industry contrary to the facets of the game itself. Which to me is new and curiously refreshing. Award nominated director Bennett Miller collaborates with script writing giants Aaron Sorkin and Steve Zaillian to bring to us one of the least tearful and melancholy baseball films since 'Major League II'. 'Moneyball' tells the actual events that transpired in 2002 when Oakland Athletics General Manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) almost resurrected this franchise from the dead with the supportive usage of computer statistics and analysis. Sure it's not really a high-strung story, but this was a major milestone in baseball history and why not bring it to the big screen.'Moneyball' makes noise about the unfortunate unfairness that was manifesting in the baseball industry as franchise giants like the Boston Red Sox and the New York Yankees can dominate the MLB by acquiring the big name stars and conjuring up the most wins. When Oakland started losing their top ranked stars, the team was out scurrying for suitable replacements. Breaking away from the traditional negotiations, Beane hires a Yale graduate Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) who found a potential loophole in the attempt to find new players. by examining statistics to get undervalued players a chance to have their well-deserved moment to shine. So Mr. Beane recruits a group of highly unlikely superstars that looked like they had a snowball's chance in the microwave to break out of their eleven game losing streak including the manager Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman) who always contradicted everything that Beane sets out to do. At first the team becomes the laughing stock of the MLB as fans continually chastise at Beane and all of his intentions of regrouping. But as things start to unravel, a monumental milestone starts to take shape.Pitt plays Beane as a man who truly cares about his team and Pitt like Beane plays his respected performance by heart. Oblivious at first, we look first hand at how he defies his own beliefs at being an invaluable commodity in the franchise. The flashbacks in the movie and his moments with his daughter we see a man who practically eats, breathes and sleeps the sport of baseball. Johah Hill plays a pivotal role as a guy who possesses a original methodical approach to rectify a team from the doldrums to winning 20 consecutive victories Hill was in excellent form and the chemistry between him and Pitt was quite flawless. Hoffman played a small role but still every effective and right on the moneymaker. Even the ragtag team of players were not just a bunch of one-dimensional caricatures, they played ball like they played the sport for years. This movie had it all, a brilliant script, a compelling subject, well-oiled performances, and the tearful moments are minimal By looking into the business side of baseball in contrast to the actual sport, 'Moneyball' is a one of a kind unique. It's where understanding the game exceeds from just the love of the game. This is one diamond of a film you should check out.",9,0,1,6 August 2012
National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Just as Silly as the First Installment
","If you thought the first 'National Treasure' movie to be surreal, well look no further, 'National Treasure: Book of Secrets' surpassed the level of surrealism of its predecessor. The trailer looked like it had potential with promising tense scenes like breaking into London's Buckingham Palace and the White House, holding the President himself hostage for the purpose to unravel the plot behind the assassination of Abraham Lincoln in 1865. Being the enthusiastic film critic that I am, I went on my mission to to the sequel to 'National Treasure' just for the sake of it. And although there was plenty of action to keep you entertained, and no scenes were never short of boredom, many scenarios left me in a state of confusion and I left the theater clueless. Archaeologist Dr. Benjamin Franklin Gates (Nicolas Cage) receives the grim news that his great-grandfather was behind the plot to murder President Lincoln. The evidence was brought to attention from a soldier (Ed Harris). In his search to prove this is untrue, Gates goes on a dangerous mission in search of a treasure that his deceased relative protected from the clutches of the Confedrate government. Helping Dr. Gates in his quest is a longtime comrade (Justin Bartha), his lover (Diane Kruger) and his father (Jon Voight). The journey takes the gang to Paris, Buckingham Palace, The White House and finally South Dakota's Mt. Rushmore. Also joining the gang is Gates' mother (Helen Mirren), a linguist in many Native languages.Many absurd question left me curious. What does this treasure serve to prove a relative's innocence? What nomadic Native tribe successfully traveled from Florida to South Dakota at a time when transportation was very limited? And finally what the hell is so secretive on page 47 of the President's Book of Secrets?All in all the action sequences were fun to watch like all Jerry Bruckheimer produced movies. It falls in the same format that made Indiana Jones a cultural icon. Maybe it's better to not worry about the format of the script and just watch the action because if you do, this movie will take a downward spiral. I must say, the actors look like they're having a ball, especially Justin Bartha who delivers some of the best lines in the movie. Voight, Mirren and Harris though are only after a quick buck. The writers were crafty to manipulate its audience into thinking they've made a clever script, but we are much smarter to know that is not the case. Director Jon Turtletaub, you're much better at making romantic comedies. Action-adventures are just not your forte. While this movie is an improvement than the first part, there is still more tweaking that needs to be done if this series should make another sequel. I'm trying to be fair about this movie as much as I can, but I think this movie is only successful in the thrill factor rather than showing any historical accuracies. It makes you believe it's intelligent and better than the rest, but I beg to differ on that. The suspense factor was sadly absent from this movie than what 'The Bourne Ultimatum' delivered. Bad decisions the characters make never pays dividends for their wrong-doings which makes the hero of the story a flawless character. I liked the movie overall, but in the end it doesn't do me any good because it offers very little to keep me convinced. It offers just as much surrealism like in the first installment. If this keeps up I might just throw in the white towel and not even consider watching another sequel.",6,0,0,23 March 2009
Angels & Demons," A Fictional Account on The Wars Between Science and Religion
","For those who wish to see a live fictional encounter between the bitterest of all rivalries, science vs. religion, then 'Angels and Demons' is your meal ticket. To all you pro-Catholic fanatics, do not despair, it's not putting down the teachings of Jesus, so please don't condemn Ron Howard, Tom Hanks and all those that contributed in the makings of this movie.This is assuming the prequel to 'The Da Vinci Code', the opening scene kick off with the Pope's death. And since the Vatican is now in the process of indicting a new leader of the Catholic Church, the opening scenes look and feel sublime and accurate. While this whole process in the works, an elite of top scientists are working on a project called the antimatter. Unless you're ignorant about science, or are just a geek who thinks this stuff is cool, well it really is anything that monumental, until you actually see what effect it has. This is another example of how Hollywood likes to further elaborate on history and science and goes so far as to draw up their own conclusions.Tom Hanks makes his return again as Dr. Robert Langdon ready to hammer in another series of coding and decoding. The Cardinal College gathers around to carefully select who will be their new leader. Just like when they selected Pope Benedict XVI, the smoke from the chimney at St. Peter's Square we know how the selection is determined. If the smoke is gray, then another vote is issued, but if it's white, then the Cardinals have selected their new Pope. But now the scientific community in in utter turmoil. The antimatter has been stolen. And in the religious, four papal candidates have been kidnapped. However, a video featured warns the Vatican that in an hour leading towards midnight, these religious leaders will be murdered and the stolen antimatter will be powerful enough to blow up Rome. The Vatican depends on Langdon because they believe that a 4 century year old adversary called the Illuminati are the ones behind this evil deed. I'm not sure how this whole rivalry started, but since this is an epic battle between science and religion, the outcome is really poignant regardless whether it is accurate or ignorant. So with time drawing near, Langdon is on a desperate quest to save Rome, find the kidnappers hideout and to confiscate the antimatter from them. Ron Howard has a certain knack for creating pop films. He tries everything to entertain you and to develop likable characters to keep the flow of his films moving. Here the suspension is a mandatory procedure to keep the film going and Howard makes sure of that. Sure it's violent, but the energy is handled very nuanced and edited to near perfection. Ayelet Zurer is amazing as the physicist who aligns with Langdon on his long journey to find the stolen antimatter. I liked the fact they kept it real and that Langdon did not have any romantic entanglements with the female scientist. Ewan McGregor was also convincing as the Camerlengo who is responsible for the selecting of the new Pope. Overall a lot in this movie is handled professionally, from the acting, the direction and the scenes. And Tom Hanks has outdone himself as he always had. Even though so far I have praised this movie, I still have some setbacks that make this film far from being a masterpiece. The score here was absolutely abominable. It was too damn loud and lacked anything from being lively. Also some of the character development was virtually non-existent. The ending was just simply awful. But the facts were quite fun, like watching a live documentary at times. So aside from these flaws it, is still fun to watch.",7,0,0,12 April 2010
Changeling," Cheap and Manipulative
","Let's see if I got this down correctly, it's Los Angeles in 1928, a young boy raised in a single working mother household disappears while he's left at home unattended. Months later, the police desperate to keep their decaying reputation intact because their so corrupt, lazily claims that they found her child. When she confronts them and tells them that's not her child, the lazy asses say she's making thing up. When she refuses to dismiss the case, the cops end up locking her away in an asylum. While this is happening, some graphic details involving another child abduction case catches their attention feeling that the misfired details to the story is more macabre than the one's been uncovered. Why would anyone want to see this exhibition of manipulative cheapness? All it delivers here is just showcasing children's lives being threatened. In a nutshell, all that this movie stems down to is fear-mongering and the audience is just simply biting into it. From what I gathered this story was based on actual events and yes I admit it's sad that these cases do happen. However, at the same time, the movie is so one-sided it's preposterous. Aside from that the events following the case lack in anything uplifting, energetic or eye-opening or any other terminology words that the Oscar hacks like to utilize. This movie fails miserably that can't be repaired. Angelina Jolie stars as single-mother Christine Collins. She works as a telephone operator and is one of the best workers on the staff. When she gets called into work one fine Saturday she leaves her son Walter (Gattlin Griffith) at home by himself. When she returns home, the boy has vanished. Five months has passed, she gets the news that the cops have found a boy located in Illinois that suitably matches Walter's description. When she arrives that the station, she is surrounded by reporters and police who are just trying to conceal their corrupt reputation as they reveal the boy to her. When she sees the boy, she confirms that this child is not Walter. But the cops knowing they goofed still want Christine to take the child anyways. She then tries to take the case even further with the chief of police Captain J.J. Jones (Jeffrey Donovan) that even though the proof that the boy they found was not Walter, he declares that Christine has serious mental disorders. And when she refuses to dismiss the case, the LAPD have her institutionalized to an asylum. While there she's befriended by fellow inmate named Carol Dexter (Amy Ryan) who instructs her on getting by in the loony bin. Meanwhile on her side, a local Reverend Gustav Brieglab (John Malkovich) who opposes corruption stands up to defends Christine's case while the token good cop Lester Ybarra (Michael Kelly) makes a grisly discovery involving a tip about a missing child who was abducted by crooked Canadian criminal. This movie clearly is every mother's worst nightmare. When we go to the cinemas, we want to be entertained and thrilled and to chase our troubles and insecurities away. So why do we need to watch a movie where real events like this one could happen to anyone at any time? What makes matters worse is that it is so surreal to actually think the cops even back then would be so corrupt and uncaring it makes this true story feel as though the production never once took this subject matter very seriously. It just never felt convincing. Sure director Clint Eastwood's intentions were good and Jolie did quite well in her respected role and had the emotions accurate in how any mother would react when faced in this dire situation. But the film quite insufferable and very painful to watch. When the final credits roll, there was no justice that truly prevailed. No feel-good moments were delivered here and it took a ton of excruciating frustrations for common sense to get through. And then some important details that could've been utilized to good effect were thrown out the window. Like why didn't they question the neighbours who were checking up upon Walter? That could've been a potential lead, but it was neglected because common sense was nowhere to be found. After all is said and done, 'Changeling' is two hours and twenty minutes of torturous manipulation that took a serious story and made very little progression to make this story enthralling.",4,0,6,31 July 2016
Frost_Nixon," Political Drama As Its Very Finest
","Admired by lot but hated by the mass there is no denying that Richard Nixon solidly stamped his reputation as a powerful leader and though he made major errors that ruined the man and virtually killed his reputation, we can't all help but show a small fragment of humanity and unleash some sympathy while many others don't even after his death in 1994. Even after his resignation from the office, Tricky Dick can still germinate power just by stepping through a door. When coming to an interview, Nixon can manipulate his responses through his commanding voice and his subliminal charm. In 'Frost/Nixon', director Ron Howard casts Frank Langella to play the part of Nixon we examine the fragile personification of just how insecure Richard truly is. Even though he's graced the screen long before I was born, this is truly one of Langella's best performance in in is illustrious career. Once his presence is on-screen, you just sit there at his attention and you're glued to him. Langella was nominated for an Oscar in his performance and his nomination was well justified. The other supporting cast were also impressive in their respected roles. The other strong leading performance comes from Michael Sheen as the downtrodden interviewer David Frost and Oliver Platt and Sam Rockwell were equally poignant as the two investigators on assignment to help Frost prepare for this very important interview that could either make him or break him. Even though Langella was carrying the heavy cargo, the supporting cast is just as important and are not being treated like glorified insignificant cameos. The real standout in terms of supporting characters was Kevin Bacon in his performance as Nixon's Chief of Staff Jack Brennan. Sure he understands that Nixon is not the most honest person ever lived but still has fondness for him. Even though he's shamed everyone including himself, Brennan still admires the man and will look up him though all damnation. Sure Bacon has always been a wonderful performer and he delivers well though I think he's undermined here. The direction from Ron Howard is one of the beat he's done in his career. The interview displayed here was both very insightful and interesting. The whole idea of a British journalist interviewing a former President may not hold everyone's interests, but the character arcs and the storyline leading to the exhilarating interview carries the film along in an immaculate perspective. Sure during this interview you can't help but feel sympathy for Frost as he's placed in precarious situation against a very intimidating man like Nixon. But you get that moment of relief when Frost retorts back at Nixon as the ex-President is beside himself knowing that Frost pulled a fast one at him. The only thing that was missing from 'Frost/Nixon' was that near the end I was hoping that a defeated Nixon would gingerly walk back into his limo. The movie displayed a corrupt leader who's action will never be forgiving no matter what. But there's still that little ounce of pity we have for the man. He made a very big mistake and in the end he's still a human being who'll live this mistake long after his death. The final ending just needed something that needed an ending that needed a powerful disclosure instead of a semi-faded whisper. The year 2008 had some really good films and 'Frost/Nixon' certainly tops the list. Frank Langella really shine brilliantly and the film will keep you interested for the next two hours. It might not have the impact like I anticipated, this movie is essentially important for all moviegoers to see. Nixon was a giant in the political spectrum and Frank Langella captured the character very splendidly.",9,0,0,30 October 2016
Walk the Line," Excellent Movie, But the Blue-Ray Stunk
","Granted, before I ever saw the movie, 'Walk the Line', I really had very little knowledge of country singer Johnny Cash's life other than a few songs he's recorded in his long career that spanned over five decades and that he was one of the very few to be inducted into the Country-Music and Rock-and-Roll Hall of Fame. I was oblivious to know that Cash was a coeval with Elvis Presley, Roy Orbison and Jerry Lee Lewis, but that he also toured with them over a two year period. Nonetheless, the film caught onto me and I never once looked back as this was one of the best biopics ever made to a man who's contributions to the music industry will be eternally etched in our memories forever. A well structured film that's entertaining and beautifully crafted, surely I was hoping that Fox would treat its blue-ray disc with the proper respect it deserves.Sure the film clearly chronicles the life and times of the versatile performer Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) and later on his wife and soulmate June Carter (Reese Witherspoon), but the dimensions in the film exceed what its integrity really is. It boldly conveys positive messages about redemption, rectification, accepting that you have a good thing right in front you and to hold on to it while you can. These idiosyncrasies are what shaped the character that Johnny Cash had made for himself. A real treat to this movie was that it went into deeper liberation to showcase a period of time before Johnny and June were soulmates. This is really digging the archives indicating a time when they were performers in their late teens or early twenties. Aside from the Oscar-calibre performances from Phoenix and Witherspoon and the excellent script/direction from James Mangold, it was well fitting that the Cash family carefully selected these performers to play the roles of Johnny Cash and June Carter. Mangold must have struck gold with the Cash's to even film scenes that many would have deemed private to other celebrities. With a script that was well blessed by the Cash's the film industry and the Oscars, this movie was truly one of the best films of 2005. Even if you're not an aficionado of country-music, the characters depicted in this film are still a pivotal eye-catcher. Towards the last years together before their deaths one year apart from each other, Johnny and June were freely able to share some moments together and to open up some rather grim realities that are not very flattering towards the people who loved them dearly. The story is more complex than it seems at first glance, but to create a series of events with skill and respect to the family and the performers who portray the characters is another staggering initiative. This is truly a story of two individuals who walked into a burning ring of fire and eventually knew they were soulmates for life.Unfortunately, the Blu-ray was kind of hit-and-miss in terms of detail. The visuals were subliminally impressive in terms of colours and structuring, and when watching it at home, it feels like you're watching it at the theatre. The sounding is also quite stupendous where the dialogue, sound effects and the music is presented with direct accuracy. If you don't have the DVD or Blu-ray, well what the hell are you waiting for? Speaking of the DVD why was it that Fox omitted the DVD features from previous releases onto the Blu-ray? The previous DVD releases has everything you need like commentary and deleted scenes and everything in the package. What's angering is that the feature 'Becoming Cash/Becoming Carter' are absent here and the 'Sun Records and the Johnny Cash Sound' is also annexed as well. The feature where Cash's faith in God is also missing in action which makes it very disappointing. And sure those features are brief, there was no need to leave those out of the Blu-ray. It kind of lacks the respect the film deserves and the many fans who cherished the legendary Johnny Cash and June Carter-Cash.",9,0,0,4 July 2016
The Incredible Hulk," Where Edward Beats Eric
","Scoot over Spider-Man and all your other appalling sequels, there's a big, scary green man taking over. No it's not the jolly green giant on a vegetable shortage, it's another one of Stan Lee's creations that has become an icon in the superhero industry, the one and only, 'The Incredible Hulk'. When I left the theaters I'm pretty sure the reception was positive or satisfying to say the least. Who could blame them? With an outstanding plot, Edward Norton's amazingly breath-taking performance, the action that's always exciting, what's there to hate? This movie exceeds everything the original Hulk with Eric Bana in many of the essential ingredients that makes movie-making successful.What scenes developed in the Eric Bana version was accomplished at a much shorter time in Edward Norton's version and more effectively. It gives you that extra boost as we see our hero who's running from the American government in South America. Nothing better than watching one monster collide with another one. He's not doing to flex his muscles and to look scary, but he's doing it to save his girlfriend and to protect humanity in every way possible. The message is quite sublime, you can see it to believe it.I can't blame Eric Bana entirely why the acting in 'The Hulk' was revolting. He showed his acting skills wonderfully in 'Troy',so what went wrong? In 'The Incredible Hulk', the love story was more immaculate and the dialogue was handled with more believable quotes from Mr. Norton and Liv Tyler. Norton is just an amazingly talented performer and his delivery of lines was simply poetic. There was a bit of humour thrown in for good measure, but unlike 'Transformers', the one-liners were sporadic and not over-the-top silly.The newly transformed Hulk looks more real and not heavily saturated in cheesy CGI. Even the design has more human looks than computerized adding effect to the fighting scenes. The action scenes were perfectly choreographed and the real-life Hulk design made it all the more possible.I must say this is a great film to enjoy and a complete makeover from the abomination that was 'The Hulk'. I even had low expectations when seeing this movie, after watching 'The Incredible Hulk' I was really marveled by the experience (pun intended).",8,1,1,22 February 2010
Requiem for a Dream," A Modern Must-See Classic
","'Requiem for a Dream' looks into the lives of four people who have entered into a world which they have become attached to but ultimately pay the price as once they've walked in it is next to impossible to escape. Jared Leto stars as Harry Goldfarb who along with his girlfriend Marion Silver (Jennifer Connelly) and his best friend Tyrone C. Love (Marlon Wayans) go into the drug-selling gig. At first it was intended to make a quick buck so that they could open up a new business because like life itself you have to spend money in order to make money. While this is happening, Harry's mother Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) becomes addicted to television and sweets, she becomes fixated on losing weight so that she can get into her little red dress so that she could become famous and become a national star on television. This leads her to an unhealthy addiction to diet pills. The four central characters end up meeting their fate that comes to the conclusion that their lives will never be the same, their reputations are shot and once they get hooked on drugs, their addictions would eventually end up taking over their lives that they'll never fully return.Under the direction from Darren Aronofsky, and based on the 1978 novel from Hubert Selby Jr, 'Requiem for a Dream' was met with extreme controversy as many critics have claimed that the movie was glorifying drug addicts by using various close-up shots as our principal four characters give a grim, in-your-face depiction of becoming a drug addict and making each character spiral to a boulevard of no return as each scene is panned out repeatedly. These people are way out on a limb, the fact is just the opposite. In fact this movie is a two hour PSA about the dangers and effects that happens when you take drugs and how it affects the lives of other people who's loved ones are also under the influence. The details are severely graphic, but very effective use of imagery to tell its story and the acting was overall really powerful with Burstyn getting an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress in a Leading Role.When I first came into watching this movie, I was in a naturally good mood and was curious to see if the viewers were right that this film is powerful but severely intense. Well it turns out that were right, in fact that were so right, my mood changed for the worst to the point that I needed to watch 20 cat videos on You Tube to get me back in a better mood.Even though the 'drugs are bad' message is shoved down our throats, Aronofsky succeeds in not making his moral message preachy. Instead he lets the performers do all the actions to get his point across. Aronofsky gives us the truthful but unpleasant task of taking us on the ride where you are living their lives and the ride you're on does not have a light at the end of the tunnel.Though the performances stand out really well in this movie, the performer that stands above everyone else is Ellen Burstyn. Her story of her fixation of getting on television and losing weight to fir into her red dress can be something we could all relate to. It's relatable, sad, tragic, but most of all, it's powerful albeit dark. It's a shame that the Oscars gave the Leading Actress win to Julia Roberts for 'Erin Brockovich'.Though there are few and far between flaws about 'Requiem for a Dream', that doesn't mean that this movie is perfect. Though it shows its purpose as to why drugs are bad, it would have been nice to see at least one of the principal four to pull through this ordeal. But to have them all suffer an unhappy ending is pushing the envelope way too far. Although it was great to see Marlon Wayans push his boundaries beyond that of the silly cartoon like comedy movies he's been in to attempt to go beyond typecast, he is still badly miscast because Tyrone is just a one-dimensional character who's a mere sidekick to his friend Harry. Of the leading four performers, his story is the weakest.The editing is quite innovative with the film using up to 2000 edits which is in compared to most films that use 600-700 edits. After the success of his debut film 'Pi', Aronofsky came up new, creative visuals that was also dded into the story as well. Like his predecessor Stanley Kubrick, Aronofsky is quite the perfectionist. So much so that he brought the right to a Japanese animated film 'Perfect Blue' as a way to visualize the scene where Marion is screaming in the bathtub.",9,0,0,26 April 2020
Sucker Punch," Convincing Enough To Watch Again
","'Sucker Punch' is very likely to have a massive fan following in the near future. It's truly one of those movie that people would flock to just to watch it over again a second time or maybe more. And I'm convinced that it is already making a splash at the video stores everywhere. Right off the bat I was very impressed by the special effects (I am an impresario for the special and visual effects in any film I see). It's one of those movies where you just kick back and enjoy the movie without a care of how good or bad your day was. Don't go into this movie trying to decipher and dissect every implausible theories you have in mind or question if this movie makes any sense or not. Such movies are not customized to gather a cornucopia of questions. 'Sucker Punch' is designed for entertainment purposes only, not trivialize its relevance and whatnot. I was saddened when they killed off one of my favorite characters, but hey I won't lose sleep over that.The fantasy scenes were absolutely mesmerizing. I hope a sequel is in the future as I hope Babydoll and company make a return soon. I want our leading protagonist to inflict revenge on her adversaries. I have more questions about the characters and plus the visuals are vibrantly tantalizing. In addition to that I found the soundtrack to be very sublime as it blends in nicely with the scenes. The female heroes during their battles is palpitating to watch and it feels like you're watching 'The Matrix' fights scenes, so kudos goes to the choreographers for their skillful training in the battle scenes. Through multiple viewings it gets more fun to watch. It's great fun to watch, bring a few friends over, get out your favorite snacks and enjoy the ride.I'm not a hater for predictable movies, sure there are a lot of whiners out there that cry about movies being too predictable, but not this film critic. As long as it carries me through the whole show, then I'm all satisfied. If they ever make a sequel I hope there will be further development in the warden's(Oscar Isaac from 'Drive') and the evil Stepfather (Gerard Plunkett) who poisoned the mother. I also want more exciting fantasy scenes and what the old meanie is doing with his gains, plus more emphasis on the dance teacher (Carla Gugino), I hope Babydoll (Emily Browning) gets further gain by taking this antagonist out of the equation. And it would be great to see the other inmates (Jena Malone, Jamie Chung, Vanessa Hudgens and Abbie Cornish) too get better character exposure. too. An awesome movie, one must not overlook.",8,6,10,2 July 2012
The Longest Yard," Can Drag At Times With An Exciting Climax
","It will never go down as a timeless classic, obviously because this a remake and remakes usually never are, but still even the original 1974 film wasn't anything we can call memorable either. This version of 'The Longest Yard' has a mixed array of comical nastiness, with some prison drama for good measure and a climactic football scene at the end. There are scenes that are at times hit or miss, but if you stay till the end, you've managed to witness the best part of the movie.Though it tries to recapture the essence of the original 1974 version, it's still just another added lazy attempt to take an old movie just to add a modern spin to appease the younger generation. What gave the 1974 version of 'The Longest Yard' a fresh take on the sports genre was that through all the plodding and conflicts aside, the fans can genuinely sit through a fictional game while at the same time, the filmmakers can do some manipulating by making it feel like it was a real game. The energy, the action and the intensity looks and feels very authentic. Since then sports themed movies have captured that formula ever since.Adam Sandler steps up here while taking himself out of his man-child phase to play the role as Paul 'Wrecking' Crewe, a former NFL star player who while drunk-driving in his girlfriend's (Courtney Cox) Bentley and then his car was smashed in a pileup. Crewe was then taken to jail at a maximum security prison where he's being roughed up by the guards who take the pleasure to abuse their power like every prison drama (the cliches come alive here).James Cromwell stars as the scheming Warden Rudolph Hazen was the man responsible for Crewe's imprisonment. His prison guards are also trained football stars and he wants his elite to win the state championship wish will guarantee that he will win his seat as the State Governor. Crewe agrees to coach this team and wants the guards to have an exhibition challenge where Hazen suggests it be up against the inmates.And so the story takes off from there, just everything from the original version is redone and recycled and it's up to the audience to make comparisons and judgments between the two. Even though it wasn't a common trend back in 1974 it is now. Like in every sports themed movies all the repeated scenarios come into play. We have the overwhelming coach, the bumbling underdog team that lacks in coordination, training sessions don't go as planned, the tough love approach, the underdogs emerging on top and other stuff that has been done to death. In the end it can be a bit of a drag with each scene doing the same things repeatedly. Crewe goes to great lengths to get big or fast guys on the team with his recurring belief that going against the guards will be the best way for them to get their comeuppance and to exploit them for who they really are.The movie does manage to stroll along, but very sporadically. if it weren't for the performances of Chris Rock who provides the most laughs here and Burt Reynolds who starred in the 1974 version and returns here which is nice as they play important roles in getting their team together. It's nice that Reynolds is playing a supporting role and not some nostalgia pop cameo role. Nice some nice comic relief from Cloris Leachman who plays an old lady who has the hots for Crewe.If you could survive two thirds of this formulaic cliche of a movie, then you are in for a real treat because the football action is filled with excitement and atmosphere. You can't get any better than this. If you're a WWE fan, you'll be pleased to see several wrestler appear here including Bill Goldberg, The Great Khali, Kevin Nash and Steve Austin. This movie may not be for everyone, especially for those who hate remakes, football or prison dramas. Please be advised there are scenes with crude humour sexual innuendos.",6,1,1,19 March 2019
Skyfall," A Film That Was Customized For Sam Mendes To Direct
","In the James Bond film 'Skyfall', director Sam Mendes has found his niche which compliments to his rather showy, but at times insipid style of filmmaking. Such films as 'American Beauty' and 'Road to Perdition' are technical landmark for Mr. Mendes; however, the movie is sadly left without a soul. With the immaculate houses, the gorgeous pompadours and the well tailored suits are a mere distraction to the rather wooden characters portrayed in those movies. And the more free-wheeling affairs like 'Jarhead' indicate to us that Mendes has very limited methods to his direction. While these movies had a plethora of good things going for it, it seems the Mendes' comfort zone rests on rather straight-forward concrete film as opposed to uneven films where the audience needs to dissect the film to draw his/her conclusions. It's obvious from the movies I mentioned that Mendes needed a film where he can adjust himself and lowering his lower qualities in his filmmaking. James Bond's 'Skyfall' is the key component to Sam Mendes' comeback.James Bond is the perfect compatible friend that Mendes needs to make a movie to suit his comfort zone. Bond is cunning, remorseless and has his mind set on fulfilling his initiatives. What a match made in movie heaven! In addition to that 'Skyfall' is the rightful vehicle for Mendes. It's filled with intrigue, it's suave plus it's a paradise full of beautiful evenings, awesome penthouses, exciting casinos, loads of alcoholic beverages, and vibrant lights. The excitement never stops. The opening scene situated atop a moving train which highlights the angry encounters between Bond (Daniel Craig) and the diabolical Silva (Javier Bardem) is a sight for sore eyes. The other memorable fight in Macau is saturated with both style and substance. 'Skyfall' has a steady flow that avoids scenes that end so abruptly or refrains from any awkward moments. The colors are magical as well the women are beautiful and the cinematography by Roger Deakins will likely put a smile to your faces.The perfect rivalry comes in the perfect form of Daniel Craig and Javier Bardem as Bond tracks down his adversary with the feeling of real life hatred between them. The supporting thespians are just as equally effective with Ralph Fiennes, Judi Dench and the well-learned Ben Whishaw as the gadget expert Q. The much talked about theme song by Adele is so beautiful it fits right in there with the Bond theme. The final showdown is both epical and at the same time uplifting, it shows that Mendes was spot on in dedication and confidence in his work. 'Skyfall' truly represents what a Bond movie should be and in this vehicle the director deserves most of the credit here.",8,1,6,16 December 2013
Catch Me If You Can," One To Keep You Engaged
",".The inspiration of the movie 'Catch Me If You Can' must have lingered in director Steven Spielberg's mind for decades after knowing the amazing misadventures our protagonist Frank Abagnale Jr. encountered throughout his very highly interesting life. Spielberg who as a youth in the 1960's used to get past security at Universal Studios just to sneak in and marvel at the art of filmmaking.Leonardo Di Caprio as Frank Abagnale Jr. is seen in the midst interviewing a Pan American supervisor to get a full report on the careers of airplane pilots for the purpose of writing an article for his high school paper. What's really going on is he's seeking knowledge on the many activities Pan Am pilots as he tries to successfully do everything he could to mimic them. Along with his savvy ways of impressions and conjuring up bogus cheques, the FBI is left high and dry as Abagnale Jr. leaks out millions of dollars from the banks. His pilot uniform gives him the advantage to cash in cheques globally.Christopher Walken is Frank Abagnale Sr. who at one time was a thriving businessman from New Rochelle, New York and is now been reduced to eating very little but his pride. The Internal Revenue Services has been giving him hell which resulted in him owing them a bucket load of cash. The Abagnales must leave their posh mansion to a small low budgeted apartment. If that wasn't bad enough, Frank Sr.'s Franch wife for many years has added flames to the fumes by divorcing the poor hard-lucked individual and goes off to marry Frank Sr's attorney friend (James Brolin) and Frank Jr's world is taken upon him.Frank Jr has often seen his father used shady techniques to get the upper hand of people, so he makes the attempt to follow his father's legacy and enhances a few tricks of his his very own. It's soon revealed that Frank Sr. was rather subtle in his manipulative tactics compared to Frank Jr. who seems like a prodigy in in white-collar criminal activity.The real turning point of the movie that will keep viewers on the edge of your seat is the exciting battle of wits between the slick con-artist as he escapes going to jail while hard-nosed FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Ranks) is hot on his trail. and would love nothing more than to see this kid eat prison food. Carl is divorced, but he is truly devoted to his job and even tried to call him at his office on Christmas Eve. They develop a bit of fondness for one another as the film progresses as Carl is impressed with Frank Jr.'s methodical suave demeanor and the game of cat and mouse is proved effective because every chance the FBI catches on to him, he seems to full a fast one on them each time. Frank Jr. admires the devotion and never give up attitude that Carl possesses in his work ethic.The film is based on the true escapades of Frank Jr. who unfortunately gets arrested in a very dramatized situation in France. However, the FBI later in the film admire the white-collar criminal's tactics to catch other potential criminal minds.After Abagnale Jr. served his sentence,he no longer continued his craft and made a butt-load of cash as a security consulter in a corporate world. In a strange twist of irony, he owed millions all the while he ended up saving millions. I guess true stories do have happy endings.Martin Sheen has a supporting role as the father whose daughter wants to marry Frank Jr. but does not seem fond of his daughter's request. The unpredictable kid with a plethora of numerous alter-egos meets her as he's seen as an E.R. medical intern and before you know it, he's now a young lawyer who passed the State Bar in Louisiana. And next we see him as an assistant junior attorney working in his future father-in0law's firm.",8,2,4,17 June 2013
The Hangover," A Real Man's Film
","Under the direction from Todd Phillips, 'The Hangover' truly personifies what it's really like to be a man (in its assets and liabilities). Comedies have personified men in ways where they can be seen as overly melancholy or too crude in their demeanour, but Phillips like he did with 'Old School' and 'Starsky and Hutch', here he knows his psychology towards the male gender without making by avoiding the traps of making them fun-loving, vulnerable and yet sincere. What makes Phillips successful as a director is his sincerity, even when his films don't always score high at the box office. o me 'The Hangover' is one of the funniest films of 2009. When you think about it most men behave the way that the characters in this movie are depicted. They can be crude, eccentric, and macabre in nature, especially when they are on the road together. While at the same time, they could be juvenile in their wild sexual urges, but also nourishing once they've settled in. But the reality is hat most men especially the married ones would rather feel comfort bonding and opening up to other men over their wives, to get a better understanding of what it's like to be a guy and to solidify their role as an alpha male. The simple plot of 'The Hangover' is about four friends who venture off to Las Vegas partying off like there's no tomorrow...only to wake up hungover and blanked out about the events that happened yesterday only to find their hotel trashed, an abandoned baby, a Bengal tiger roaming around loosely and chickens scattered all over the suite. To be blunt something doesn't quite add up. An early scene describes the importance of male-bonding. We have one of the four guys named Stu (Ed Helms), a well disciplined dentist who is living with a self-absorbed control freak girlfriend named Melissa (Rachael Harris), whom he plans on marrying. She finds it uncouth that he's hanging out with his friends even though she think they're going to Napa Valley to indulge in wine testing. In her eyes, Melissa believes that men are practically disobedient women who need female partner to set them on the straight and narrow. But in reality, Stu being more level-headed than the other guys just really wants to socailize with someone of his gender. The events that proceed might turn into the worst two days of their lives while at the same it's also the best two days of their lives. While the well-disciplined Stu hangs out with his three friends, which are Doug (Justin Bartha), the groom-to-be who's very protective of the Mercedes his father-in-law lent him (Oy vey!) Then there's Phil (Bradley Cooper) a cool customer who's not very comfortable about being domestic. And then you have Alan (Zach Galifianakis), Doug's future brother-in-law who steals the show as their simple friend who's there for the ride, but has well intentions. The opening scenes in 'The Hangover' are funny not only in the situations these characters are facing, but the dialogue is also both clever and witty. Phillips along with screenwriters Jon Lucas and Scott Moore call all in the humour that at times boarders on grotesque (one characters serves his breakfast with a side of vomit) but it fits well into the story. These are just average guys who just want to have fun, although they found it more complex than they could imagine because it's harder to have fun when you're older than compared to when you were a teenager. By the time they wake up, Stu's front tooth was extracted, Phil is seen sporting a hospital bracelet around his waist and Doug is MIA. The fun was sweet but the hangover is the least of their problems. The search for Doug gives the gang a reason for staying their welcome in Vegas and helps the story flow quite naturally. As they come to their senses, the gang start to realize how everything turned out the ay it did and will stop at nothing to correct themselves and their situations. The weak areas of the film come during the last act where the comical factors get watered down. But it never loses its focus or meanders off in another genre. It's a dark comedy that stays true to its genre. Many sitcoms and other comedy movies can learn a thing or two from 'The Hangover'. In its duration, the crew from 'The Hangover' took the liberties to offer the film with vulgar and tasteless jokes and scenarios and outrageously deliver plot twists that unpredictably come from out of nowhere. Just when they think they got everything under control, they pull back, which is not all that bad. 'The Hangover' is movie that never delves into anything remotely horrible, but rather the horrible events they encountered that created memories that could pass on to their kids when they're older.",9,0,0,25 December 2017
Ghost," A Film That Goes Beyond Excellent
","Even though the film world has made this 1990 movie 'Ghost' as being insignificant, inferior to other movies that came out in this time period. But to me Whoopi Goldberg's Oda Mae Brown could easily pass off as one of the most near-perfect, intriguing, mesmerizing characters to ever be featured on celluloid. Her character has truly exceeded any character that Charles Dickens or William Shakespeare ever created. Goldberg literally sold her character and when she graced the screen with her performance, people were just dying to see her such a dynamic performance and who could blame them.With the 1980's coming to a close, we has the honours to reflect what a decade it has been in the era of film-making. Some of the great creative minds emerged from this occasion. It was a time when thinking and direction was compatible. There was very few lazy remakes or CGI green screen dependency. It was originality and creativity all the way. There was no competition to see how much money you make in one day. Artists like Robert Greenwald was creating artful flicks like 'Xanadu' and Ridley Scott was making original modern-day fairy tales like 'Legend', no one expected that the 1990's would come along with a plethora of bummer films. It was like the creativity was lost. The colourful and the spontaneous dynamics were badly watered down with blandness and half-baked films that were only out there. The only film of the 1990's that had the charm that was lost in the 1980's was the 1996 movie 'Evita'. While the 1990's crept up with its grunge, baggy clothes and other societal lowering, the time to have something to embrace on was eagerly anticipating. So while cinema was going on the decline, 1990 did provide a gem that will eternally be etched in the hearts of many because everyone had already figured out this film was going to be special because they were getting tired of the grating films that were hitting the box office this film was selling faster than hotcakes. This was clearly Jerry Zucker's best directed film (no matter what, he never exceeded his expectations). It has everything to offer, great acting, brilliant script, a few chuckles, a few cries, but the score was excellent. I mean I love the oldies and one of the most beautiful ballads is 'Unchained Melody' by The Righteous Brothers. If that song won't have you slow-dancing with a partner. I don't know what will? Even the special effects though low-key deserve mentioning.Even though 'Ghost' is worthy of all its accolades it may surprise you that with the powerful big budget films that were coming out in 1990 like 'Mermaids', 'The Little Mermaid', 'Goodfellas' and the grandest of them all 'Dances with Wolves', 'Ghost' was the biggest budgeted film that year, but was still the underdog in the Academy Awards category. What made this film stand out the most was the performance of Whoopi Goldberg as Oda Mae Brown. She sold her character above everyone else, even the late Patrick Swayze (his baby will always be 'Dirty Dancing'), and Demi Moore who's career stalled after the Brat Pack. It was her flair, her charisma that carries the beat of this movie. She truly stands out like no other performer. She truly is a diamond in the rough. Granted Miss Goldberg did win the Best Supporting Actress Oscar that year for her performance as Oda Mae Brown. And the critics around chewed on that notion including me. But their rhetoric is vague and at times not fully justified. But I must go deeper and to assume that Oda Mae Brown was around before we ever knew Whoopi Goldberg in fact Oda and Whoopi are two completely different people. What I'm trying to say is that I'm not a big fan of Whoopi Goldberg (not that I loathe her either) and that this movie and 'The Colour Purple' were the two movies that made Whoopi a household name. I would love to see her make a sequel or even a remake to 'Ghost'. I mean her humanitarian efforts are phenomenal, but her acting is greatly missed. And the long awaited return of Oda Mae Brown gracing the screen is something I would pay to see.",10,2,3,16 August 2015
Spartacus," Not A Complete Kubrick Film, But His Traits Are All There
","The very modest Stanley Kubrick never gave himself full credit to the contributions in making 'Spartacus', which makes sense because he was not in full creative control. The main individual behind most of the project is actor/producer Kirk Douglas (Douglas was also the man who was responsible for hiring Kubrick a week after the filming had begun). Still of the sequences, the themes and the characters have the feeling and symbolism that Kubrick possessed in the four decades he had as a director.Based on a historical novel by Howard Fast, which was based on actual events, 'Spartacus' tells the tale of a slave as he trains to become a gladiator who then emerges as a leader of an epical slave uprising in the Roman Republic. Spartacus (Douglas) is a brave and loyal individual who has strong admiration towards his people much like Christ, only the setting of this movie was before Christ was born. Sure not all the historical context is accurate, but the performances by the star studded cast will simply amaze you, and the epic historical period piece is reminiscent to the classic around the year it was filmed. But what might come as quite a shock was that the levels of violence are very graphic and quite brutal (especially for a 1960 film). It is also saturated with political and sexually explicit content added to the script by writer Dalton Trumbo (who was blacklisted by commie hunter Joseph McCarthy). The visual eye-candy is a treat for the eyes and has lot of Kubrick symbolism including the vibrant cinematography, the clever camera angles and the nuanced themes of alienation and the evils of dehumanization.Kirk Douglas looks like he was carved out of stone gives a very powerful performance as Spartacus; however he may come across as bit over-the-top. But that's just my point of view. I last time only saw this movie was years ago, when I was a rowdy adolescent who's hobbies were cookies, comics and cartoons. But he's not alone in this as he's backed up by a plethora of powerful thespians like Laurence Olivier, Charles Laughton, Peter Ustinov and Jean Simmons who also share the spotlight and succeeds nicely here.In the end I thought it was an amazing film, not the greeted film of all time, but nowhere close to being the worst film I've ever seen. To call it a minor Kubrick film is no exaggeration to say the least. The main flaw is that some scenes tend to drag on for too long and I think there are times when 'Spartacus' tries too hard to be an epical war period piece (which it does no question about it), but it crams too many sequences in that some scenes were not all needed. But it's still intriguing, technically sublime and the fight scenes were very well choreographed. If you like historical war period pieces that will keep you enthralled, you'll likely enjoy 'Spartacus'.",8,2,3,6 January 2014
United 93," An Unforgettable Tale of Tragedy
","I was a little doubtful of wanting to anticipate watch a movie that sparked fear and sadness not just to the United States, but all over the world (even here in Canada) about the tragic plane crashes of the September 11, terrorist attacks. 'United 93' takes us on the painful journey to United Flight 93 as it was scheduled to take off from Newark to San Francisco, but instead landed in field just outside of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The plane had no survivors. It feel like this tragic events happened yesterday when it was actually 12 years ago. To this day I asked myself the harrowing question. Was anyone prepared for something like this to happen? I still felt reluctant of going to see it and I don't think every inch of this tragedy can be fleshed out in just two hours.But after much debate, I had the bravery to watch 'United 93'. Lots of things happened that day that changed the lives of others, me included. The world was in fear, shock and sadness. And the unity within our brotherhood never felt so stronger. So off I went to see the movie and I said to myself if this movie becomes a forceful tear-jerker or exploitive, I would walk out.Well from my observation I didn't see any scenes that were a rip-off and or making a salary at the expense of many civilians who were killed in one of the most tragic events in modern history. I was even heart struck when I read somewhere that the proceeds would be funded to family members whose loved ones died on that tragic day. A selfless act like this does not happen everyday.The characters portrayed in the film, passengers, crew, air controllers, and grief-stricken families were performed with class and compassion. I think the most challenging performance were the actors who played the terrorists and the responses they got after the film was released. Director Paul Greengrass left no stone unturned to recreating this event and making every scene kept real and all the while refraining it from being over-the-top in dramatization or any kind of awkward performances. The research done in making this movie was researched through people who were working and received calls from crew who were on board Flight 93, recordings on cell phones, and data recordings. Mr. Greengrass was doing his homework when he made this movie.If you remember, it was a sad day for all humankind. You might remember what you doing on that day. And at some point you feel like a jerk just sitting there watching the stuff happen on the screen. This movie makes you want to get off your chair and get involved and help these people out. The patrons on this aircraft are just average folks like us, going to some destination. This movie pays homage to people committing selfless acts to save one another's lives and to show that humanity is out there.As an order of precaution to younger viewers watching, be advised that there's a lot of heavy violence, very loud scenes, ruthless actions and profanity happens in this movie. Therefore, just watch this movie with care and see for yourself what this movie brings to you.",9,1,2,7 October 2013
Finding Neverland," A Great Story of Creating a Great Story
","'Finding Neverland' was really an enchanting tale for the masses to enjoy. Eight years ago at the theatres, I had the pleasure of seeing this movie and it was truly something you don't see everyday from the life in the fast land pictures that has infested the screens over the past few years. It is a rare find to see an exhibition of story filled with fantasy, imagination and an original story about the inspiration of J.M. Barrie and the muses he took in creating one of the greatest classical children stories of all time, 'Peter Pan'.Johnny Depp stars as Mr. Barrie, a Scottish writer who falls through troubled times because his previous work was a complete bust. As he was walking through the park, he runs into Sylvia Davies (Kate Winslet) and her four sons and they get together for a warm and friendly chat. As the film progresses, they start to get closer and it eventually leads Barrie to write his greatest work which would become a classic in the making.The centrepiece of the film is on Barrie and his closeness to the Davies clan and by using his observation skills to understand children's behaviour, the path that led to the creation of 'Peter Pan' and adding Indians and Pirates for added texture to the iconic children's story.Marc Forster who also directed the 2001 hit 'Monster's Ball' was behind the director's chair in this one adds magic towards the character of Barrie as we follow him through the whole process that led his masterpiece that is 'Peter Pan'. Depp was excellent in his portrayal as Barrie and the Scottish accent was spot on and his performance was quite sublime. Great performances by the cast, especially from Kate Winslet, Julie Christie and Dustin Hoffman (he played Captain Hook in 'Hook' go figure!). But the real standout was from Freddie Highmore who played the youngest boy Peter Davies and his bravado materializes near the end.I truly believe that this was one of the best films that came out in 2004. If you've seen movies like 'Big Fish' than this movie will surely please you.",9,3,3,3 December 2012
Training Day," Where One That Supplies Various After-Thoughts
","At the end of the Oscar-winning movie 'Training Day', one must ask, 'where's the fine-line between doing what's right and the tactics one must go through in accomplishing it?' The hero in the story faces this enigmatic question from the moment he wakes up till he goes to sleep at night. Getting tired of the usual routine of parking tickets and arresting drunk drivers, Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) is young cop who has bigger aspirations into the police force. His ambition is crack down on bigger game like muggers, murderers, rapists and all other assorted weirdos plaguing the streets of Los Angeles. Thus he en-rolls in a training session with LAPD's finest narcotics detectives Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). During the process, young Jake learns more than he could chew when he discovers that detectives are not always prone to play-by-the-rules. Now he's in a position where he must decide if he wants to continue or if he wants to end it. The script is very well researched and very easy to grasp at. The dialogue is fast and furious and can be very witty at times. The pace is at its most convenient and though the action is wild it still offers room for plenty of mind-numbing twists. The only real flaw is that it gives a negative view of how unlawful the more advanced law enforcers can be. Those alleged people who protect us from crime are no more criminal than the people they arrest. In many true story films like 'American Gangster' (another film Washington was in) proves my point. Denzel Washington deserved his Oscar here as he takes direct command in this movie. Even in the scenes where he's only mentioned by name, he still makes his presence felt. Denzel who can play good guy roles to near perfection does something that few actors and actresses can do: take a u-turn to type-casting and play a more tyrannical character. Ethan Hawke is equally impressive as a cop who must have long restless nights wondering how did he get himself into this mess and how to get out of it or if there is a way out of it. Sadly the supporting cast are mostly underdeveloped fillers with really no depth. For an action movie, the action is quite scarce. Most of the tense scenes are through the unsettling of Jake's inner conscious. The real story isn't about Jake's fight for what's right, but just the inner emotions that are screaming at Jake every moment he goes to work or training. You want thrill-seeking shooters rent 'Lethal Weapon'. The violent scenes are not for the squeamish and the gore is very believable. Sure it has plenty of action for the action-junkie, but it's also a very intelligent film to back up on as well. The theme is who should you trust, your soul or your mind? With stunning action scenes and a believable premise, this has got to be the best heart-warming thriller that will leave you stunned for a long time.",9,2,3,28 September 2009
Friday Night Lights," A Sports Film With a Touch of Humanity
","Set in Odessa, Texas in the year 1988, 'Friday Night Lights' centres around a town in Texas who's thriving to make it into the state finals. But the issues go way beyond the gridiron, as players are faced with personal issues as we cross-examine them through the benefits of sports and the triumphs and setbacks that comes with the package while the whole town wants this team to win like their lives are depending on them.This is not the cliched underdog story with the selected team we're forced to root for to go all the way. The big rewards are the events that led to the team winning which is more reflective in storytelling and feels more refreshing in its premise. There are moments that are melancholy and humane, intense and surreal, hopeless and triumphant. Sure this film seems to be the perfect companion for sports lovers, but if you're not fanatical about sports, there's plenty more to like about this film. The human issues depicted in this movie has equally poignant moments than compared to the action on the football field.Under the direction of Peter Berg who co-starred with Linda Fiorentino in 'The Last Seduction', utilizes his power to tell an intriguing story while pulling no punches about it. Sure the settings of this film is in the late 1980's, you wouldn't really know the difference with its modern outlook. The cuts are quick-paced, the hand-held shots are quick-tempered, but it works effectively due to the point of view that comes behind it all. Berg wants us to a part of his world contrary to the ones we live in. His concentration is not about the actual game but the dramatic scenes that lead prior to the climactic game like it was a memory we can reminisce to our grandchildren when we get older.While filmed on stock angles, the film truly feels just like a flashback. The period details are enough to this film a more storied effect in its presentation making this archaic technique all the more sufficient. The film does succeed giving the background that 1980's vibe with costumes, clothing and props that were prominent to the time period this film is set in. A firm example is that the female costars are sporting the typical big thick haired pompadour that was apropos for the 1980's.Billy Bob Thornton adds to the authenticity as a sports a look that is similar to that of a young Jimmy Swaggert as Coach Gary Gaines who combines the willfulness to win while playing an important role in his young player's lives. He can really turn the role of his personality as he can be volatile in one moment and then compassionate in another.Coach Gaines has a lot on his mind as he's placed in a disposition of very talented players, but are still green, but he hopes to change that with their need for speed. One of the prominent characters on the gridiron is a young man named Boobie Miles (Derek Luke), a arrogant player who plans to make it big. Those plans come in question when an injury sidelines him. Boobie now has to think from the outside while looking on while sitting out while seeking other options in life outside of football.Though Berg and screenwriters Buzz Bissinger snd David Aaron Cohen lures into caring about which team is going to win, does not mean the characters themselves feel the same way. Therefore, we get the better understanding of how obsessive the town is in its dependence not how the team is playing, just as long as they win the state championship. Every other time, the life in that town is one long, cynical slog, but the championship season, the town lights up brighter than the neon lights of Sin City. The stress factor is on these kids as they strive to make these memories all the more worthwhile while trying to appease to the drab, unmotivated adults which lacks in any healthy relations.Tim McGraw who plays Billingsley, an abusive father to one of the players gives an unhealthy reprimand to his son that this game will mean more to him than anything he's ever going to achieve in life. Granted he's right sine like so many others in that town who's one-track-mind fixation is all that's coming to them. The execution to that frame in mind is handled brilliantly. When Gaines drives home after being ostracized over the radio, he's confronted by two local townspeople threatening his job if his team doesn't win. Gee no rest for the weary?Even though as adults they'll remember this event as long as they live, the kids they were back then were left feeling miserable, frustrated and stressed out not from the coach or their regiment or even, let alone the game, but by the townsfolk who forced them to excel, not through their hard work, but by their own personal pride. The tension is bestowed upon Lucas Black's performance as the star quarterback and Garrett Hedlund shines as the young Billingsley. Although masked as a football film, the drama of this story is about a football team drafted into a metaphorical war zone obsessed by the neurotic pleasures of the citizens of Odessa, Texas.",8,4,4,11 March 2018
John Wick," Excellent Movie In All The Right Places
","Even though Hollywood gets badly ostracized by the masses (including me) there comes a time when every now and then, it brings a surprisingly great film and 'John Wick' clearly personifies that Hollywood doesn't always turn in money-wasting films. 'John Wick' combines great solid action, with awesome visuals, subtle humour and provides something quite refreshing to the traditional action film. When first seeing this film I did have my doubts about it because of the formulaic stereotypes it has in this genre, but it didn't really bother me at all because I was enthralled by the visuals. And then I looked at who the scriptwriter is and I sighed because it was written by Derek Koldstad, who's been writing convoluted script for straight to DVD vehicles for Dolph Lundgren. And finally I checked in to see who directed it was by Chad Stahelski, a former stuntman who had some assistance from another stuntman, Davis Leitch. Whatever it was they did, it worked and I give my hats off to them for their efforts to bring something new to the table. From the opening scenes, the clichés come right to us without any denial. Keanu Reeves stars as John Wick, an ex-hit-man trying to get away from it all (like we've seen before). His wife Helen (Bridget Moynahan) who has helped him break free from his old ways is now dying of a lingering progressive disease. In return she has left him an adorable little puppy so that he can remain the better man he's become. But then evil remorseless gangsters steal his car and kills his puppy like it was all in a day's work. What was dumb about these gangsters is they refused to do background checks as to which assassin they are dealing with. For the animal sensitive viewer, the scene was not entirely graphic, but it will make you hate the bad guys even more, like what's expected of a film like this. What makes matters worse is that the car is a 1969 Mustang. So therefore revenge is not optional here, it must be done, bar none.Even though he's been called down by the critics, but Keanu Reeves stars here and here he has succeeded in shutting up all those who have condemned him in the past. He was amazing here and may have exceeded his performances in 'The Matrix' series. To me it feels like a new awakening for Keanu at 51 and is now making those who maligned him, to eat crow. What could I say? 50 is the new 40 and he never looked better.What really blew my mind about 'John Wick' are the action scenes which are truly mesmerizing. The way they executed on screen was original being that it was subtle and not as campy or cartoon- like. The choreography was spot on and the fight scenes looked and felt authentic and convincingly deadly. The brutality and violence truly will get your heart pumping, and it'll hurt just thinking about it.The fight scenes offer up new elements and inventive in its delivery. But the cinematography is something about 'John Wick' which can't be neglected. The colours of grey and brown offer a retro feeling reminiscent to the 1950's noir films with a modern twist to it. Set in New York City as a picturesque fantasy landscape your grandparents in the 1950's may have imagined what the Big Apple would look like today which even includes a ritzy hotel like The Continental, which is a facility for refuge, a social club and a relaxing centre for those who commit felonies. That' better then what we expected for underworld crime bosses who hang out in dilapidated apartments where they're gambling their fortunes with their beer mugs and ashtrays, therefore a place like The Continental looks like a better hangout spot for these guys. It has a bit of a 'Sin City' thing going for it only more grounded and more real. With a sequel coming out I'll surely be the first at my ticket stand. 'John Wick' has truly resurrected the action genre. It's brutal, violent and and no holds barred a gritty R-rated film that's not afraid to deliver or offend. It may have clichés, but once you seen the movie you'll forget all about the clichés.",9,3,7,30 November 2015
Erin Brockovich," The Ultimate Julia Roberts Movie
","'Erin Brockovich' is truly the film that truly made Julia roberts a star being that she transitioned herself from a star in romantic comedies, here she makes the move to starring in a movie that won her over with the fans and with the Academy Awards in 2001.Starring in titular biopic of a paralegal confronting corrupt businesses and exposing their fraudulent ways without a care for her reputation in the process. The sides of Brockovich are handled in three integral parts. Her crass ways are never vulgar, just high-spirited. She may dress with questionable taste, but she has a heart of gold. If she berates and verbally mocks other people it's not that she's inconsiderate or mean, but because a lot of the corporations she's taking on hire some of the most underhanded and corrupt people on this planet. And for a bonus, she may act like she's naive, but we realize that she even hoodwinks the viewers revealing she's anything but.'Erin Brockovich' epitomizes every character that Roberts has starred in since she made her debut in the mid 1980's. The character of Brockovich herself is the atypical figure that the film industry idolizes. Roberts was rightfully cast as she can talk tough and smart and still be attractive at the same time.The movie centres around this young paralegal who is a divorced, single mother of three children who's journey itself deserves to be written on paper. Though her job is not all that exciting or heavily paid, but was stunned when she found out that a major corporation like Pacific Gas and Electric were offering to underhandedly pay medical bills in the California town where their offices run. She goes undercover to further investigate with all the essential documents needed for a class action lawsuit and exploiting this corporation that are responsible for contaminating the water which has contributed to many civilians who have contacted several health problems.In her grinding research, she has met a hairless little girl who had to have chemotherapy, a lady battling breast cancer and her husband who's dying of lymphoma. In one of the more pivotal cases she tells a woman named Donna Jensen (Marg Helgenberger) that what's ailing her is not from bad luck, but bad water which led to her getting her kids out of the water.Under the direction of Steven Soderbergh and based on actual events, this movie stands out as a true underdog story of how a small time paralegal goes through great lengths to take down a big corporation that has investments raging in $28 billion. Albert Finney plays lawyer Ed Masry who will have to go though great lengths to exploit this company for who they really are. Nobody ever said this case was going to be easy. Granted that Roberts usually handles performances on her own merits, but here it's Soderbergh that calls the shots plus he has to in order for this film to work and being this is not a fictionalized character she's portraying.If Roberts took control of the character, this movie would end up falling victim to satire. Though she carries the heavy cargo throughout the movie, her emotions have to be spot-on and the camera's attention is based off of her. The other cast members have to remain frozen until Roberts has the final camera-shot of her. Whether she's happy, angry or in crocodile tears, we the audience are cued how to react. Roberts has a reputation of being quite self-indulgent and though Soderbergh gives her that freedom to some extent, to the point where it really becomes Julia's world and everyone else is just secondary.Soderbergh does assure that the supporting characters are not underused here. Finney's character Masry is strong here though his reactions are mostly to stay disgruntled by his head-strong clerk, but underneath that hidden exterior is a man with a heart of gold who's contemplating retirement, but her presence does give him some strength. Veanne Cox is outstanding in some low-key comic relief as an uppity lawyer who's big fault was to usurp the determined Brockovich.The only weak scenes is when Erin's personal life is added to the story. And though Aaron Eckhart was very good as the George, the kindly biker who looks after Erin's kids all day. Sure it adds character development to some extent, but other times it can be a bit of overkill. The personal scenes were at the most quite mundane. Fortunately the lawsuit is still the primary focus and this is what people came in to see even going far as to say they would rather watch the lawsuit scenes than Roberts gracing us with her emotions.",8,1,1,3 July 2019
Star Trek," A New Trek Here To Stay
","Here's a summer blockbuster, saturated in exciting adventures, hypnotic action, and intriguing characters and performances that will keep you glued to your seat. While this new adaptation may arouse the Trekkie fans all around, it successfully sets the tone for a thought-provoking prequel to the TV series and a potential run for future sequels. Opening scenes starts with a bang as we follow two young Starfleet officers Captain James Kirk (Chris Pine) and his faithful Vulcan assistant Mr. Spock (Zachary Quinto) as they join forces to recruit medical officer Dr. Leonard 'Bones' McCoy (Karl Urban), communications officer Uhura (Zoe Saldana), helmsman Mr. Sulu (John Cho), wisecracking Russian prodigy Chekov (Anton Yelchin) and chief engineer Scotty (Simon Pegg)to their gravitational field. While this is just the scratch of the surface, the plot goes way beyond the origins of gathering recruits to run the U.S.S. Enterprise. For gurus of the original 1960's series and the movie series from 1979-1991, this movie is reeling in history like the appearance of Captain Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood)as he expresses mutual admiration for Admiral Archer (reminiscent to the Enterprise series)and the symbolic Kobiyashi Maru hold Kirk utilized in 'The Wrath of Khan'. Granted, some of the cast don't always deliver their performances deadpan to the characters of the original TV series, but I was willing to accept that knowing it wouldn't happen, but but the storyline gives them the liberty to change things around and they accomplish that feat admirably. Karl Urban pays homage to Deforest Kelly's Dr. McCoy through his personality and quirks. Let's not forget Simon Pegg's Scotty's gleeful characteristic was portrayed with sheer brilliance. Zachary Quinto was absolutely perfectly cast as Mr. Spock which we've grown to love in the 1960's and successfully utilizes the many traits that the Vulcan's possess and even has the opportunity to stand face to face with the original Spock (Leonard Nimoy)As for the characters of Sulu, Chekov and Uhura, they manage to have their fun in the sun, but the actors (Yelchin, Cho and Saldana) shed a different light to the characters from the 1960's series but didn't tamper them too much. I felt sorry for Chris Pine not performance wise, but because he has a tough act to follow as the new Capt. Kirk and to take the helm of carrying the movie. It must have been tough to follow the quirks and personality of William Shatner that might be impossible to duplicate. Therefore, Pine must rely on his own traits that make him unique. The heroes of the Enterprise shine in their roles immaculately, the villains here are equally special and play it by heart. Eric Bana as the Romulan leader Nero was a convincing character being that he's not out to do evil for fun, he's in turmoil and yearns his turmoil to those who put him this way. The complexity of this character is obvious, but Bana adds that spark that goes beyond the typical Trekkie villain. The new design of the Enterprise is a fascinating look and the layout seems functional and quite snazzy. The backbones of the NCC-1701 is a curious discovery with the piping and electrical equipment. We get to explore how maintenance is handled on the ship with the smaller people working behind the main control room.The musical score by Michael Giacchino which compliments the opening scenes as the dark overtones and logos and goes on a tear in the opening action scenes. But when the undertones are backed by the voice-over we're all too familiar will bring you back in time to the original series like the way Alexander Courage did it.",9,1,4,7 June 2010
As Good as It Gets," The Film Was Worth the Wait
","Sadly I never had the chance to view it in the theatres, and I as hold back on it with the suspicion that it was going to be an overrated, formulaic, mushy romantic comedy which stars Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt. Surprisingly, it went beyond my expectations that it totally deserved the hype that was praised upon by viewers and the Oscars including the win for Best Picture when it came out in 1997.Jack Nicholson plays cantankerous, people-hating romantic author Melvin Udall who avoids human contact except insulting people, is very routine by his agendas and is has a deep phobia of germs. The only two people that seem to tolerate him is gay neighbour Simon (Greg Kinnear) and an eatery where every waitress avoids this jerk except for Carol Connelly (Helen Hunt) who can withstand his verbal abuse. His life goes to a great transformation when Simon gets beaten and Melvin befriends Simon's dog, Verdell.We don't need to cram our brains with ideas of which way this story is going. That's because it's so simplistic they are in some ways spoon-feeding us with by-the-numbers details that just depends on the characters interacting with each other in a natural way, the plot is very micro in terms of what this movie pans out. The plot falls victim to weaving around in circles, we do feel that there is very little direction to make this movie feel real. But the strangeness that brings this film to our attention was that you get the impression that you want nothing more than to sit back and watch the film in its entirety, no matter how bizarre it is.'As Good As it Gets' makes no apologies that the film is starving of a plot, but survives on the performances and the character interactions from the script by Mark Andrus. From the misanthropic writer, the insecure waitress mother that has a child who is sick, to the gay, unfortunate artist,they are backed up nicely by a myriad of other reliable supporting characters. Not any of them are blessed with perfection through their veins, but that's what keeps the film real. In addition to that, they don't offer a lot of special qualities about them. Which is not a bad thing because these are the people we meet everyday in our lives. Some of them are people we could have met before with similar problems they're facing or have encountered before. The script injects that magical touch to make their ornery lives compelling you can't help but to sympathize with them. Even for the leading character who is as unlikable as they come, there is still some aspect that he yearns for our sympathy. Yes the ending is gooey and by-the-numbers, we can overlook that and give praise to the script that Andrus delivers. The dialogue delivered is done with a quirky, quick pace, and throughout it depends on humour, the jokes don't always come together, but it's still fun to listen in.Of course engaging characters and humourous dialogue would be null and void without an excellent cast. Fortunately, the cast is as good as the title of the film says it best. Jack Nicholson was wonderful in a film that was meant for Bill Murray as the cantankerous writer. He still oozed in great intensity, but showed a great knack for comedy in one of his most hilarious films to date. The dark humour he delivers is spot-on and still has enough charm to make us feel for this jerk. Helen Hunt is wonderful as the harried single mother nurturing her asthmatic son plus her warmth and caring nature is just the perfect contrast to Nicholson's character, but the chemistry between the two thespians were spot on. Greg Kinnear adds wonderful support as the gay painter Simon who's equally charming like Jack and Helen.Even though it's a wonderful film in spite of its cliches and predictable nature, the biggest flaw about this movie was that it went on for way too long. I don't have a short attention span or anything like that, but most romantic comedies should only run for 90 minutes to an hour and forty-five at tops. This film is about two hours and twenty minutes long. But the script, the dialogue, the characters and performances made up for the flaws and I was glad I had chance to watch this on DVD. It's very highly recommended.",7,1,1,27 February 2018
Darkest Hour," Great Acting By The Cast Was Spoiled By The Fantasy Script
","Director Joe Wright takes 'Darkest Hour' to Winston Churchill's early years as Prime Minister as he's now on his own in his involvement during one of darkest moments in world history as WWII is at its pinnacle, Churchill must make decisions that will determine the fate of Europe if such parties should succeed. One thing for sure, failure is not an option. While the performers might have a well balance of character both physically and mentally, the real red herring was when the script meanders into the realms of fantasy over accuracy.In recent years Sir Churchill has been a popular historical character to portray with President Lincoln coming at a close second. From Brian Cox, to John Lithgow, from Michael Gambon to Robert Hardy and getting mention in high prolific movies like 'Dunkirk', 'A United Kingdom' and 'Viceroy's House'. Now it's time for Gary Oldman to step up to the front of the line to portray one of the greatest Prime Ministers in British history. From the looks of things, Mr. Oldman has molded himself in near perfect detail from the rounded jowls to the rich sonorous voice, Oldman's portrayal is the best one of the whole bunch.Wright's film directs us to May of 1940 where ailing Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain (Ronald Pickup) declares he's resigning his position due to declining health while under pressure brought on by the Labour Party leader Clement Attlee (David Schofield). At first Chamberlain appoints Viscount Halifax (Stephen Dillane) to take over, but felt he wasn't ready up to the task. Therefore, Chamberlain dig deep and appoints Churchill to replace him. In an awkward twist, we find that Churchill is not present to hear this announcement, with one MP whispering something made for some witty sarcastic banter. The dialogue used in Anthony McCarten's script provides the weak spots to 'Darkest Hour' as he replaces a more reverent use of speech to more a more cynical humour that almost feels satirical over authentic. Another primary example stems from the somewhat estranged relationship between Churchill and his wife Clementine (a near-perfect Kristen Scott-Thomas) after one of his shouting matches to her, she responds by calling him ,'an insufferable, pig'!Although Churchill is a stapled named in the history books when the subject of WWII comes to mind, almost like he's an immortal comic book hero of some sort, but in the end, he's still human and his decisions have not always been the smartest. But still he's weaker moments in history doesn't get enough mention. Take for instance the Gallipoli disaster come up time to time but is regarded as minor flaw when really it's anything but. Or even his angst-laden weekly get together with King George VI (a subtle performance by Ben Mendelsohn who lays low on the trademark stammer) who questions how he manages to hold a high position while consuming so much alcohol. His direct response, 'practice'.And even though the witty banter is subtle hyperbole, it still has moments where it holds a place in remaining plausible. But the script can't seem to get a grip on the scenes and situations where Churchill is at his most vulnerable in the more challenging moments that occurred during the events of of WWII. Where the Nazis overthrow the smaller countries, the French army is losing it's battle, 400,000 Allied soldiers were deported to the French island of Dunkirk, where he's stuck in the war cabinet while Chamberlain and Halifax are persuading for him to make surrender with Germany, it's where the realism of the story meanders to fantasy territory. The most absurd moments was when King George pays a nightly visit to him while unprotected and unguarded who out of nowhere and without a reason arbitrarily takes his side to tell him to consult the people and ask for their approval. So after getting off an underground locomotive, he addresses to the people if he should surrender his fight and let Hitler take over. The crowd responses 'Never!' and with that he read off a quote from Macaulay's 'Horatius'. All the while the train ride from St. James Park to Westminster seems to take 10 minutes.Wright's awkward direction never fully recovers from the surrealism in spite of the acting that is truly top of the line. Ronald Pickup was truly amazing as the gaunt and ill Chamberlain (who would die six months later from cancer). Stephen Dillane was also quite impressive as Lord Halifax who has a vampire-like image towards him. Oldman delivers a powerful speech in the end with the 'we shall fight on the beaches' but it's not very likely that he would be right there on the District Line.",6,1,4,21 October 2018
Memento," A Favorite Of Mine
","For the first time in nearly nine years since its release, 'I had the opportunity to watch Christopher Nolan's authentic masterpiece, 'Memento', which to this date holds a special place in my heart. Guy Pearce throws himself into his part as Leonard Shelby, a man who has suffered from a short-term memory loss. Shelby can reminisce the past, but his amnesia forces him to not recall any recent memories.Shelby depends on tattoos to keep him on track of things and may lead up to finding his wife's killer and the person who's responsible for his memory loss. Shelby also sports photographs of people, his motel and his car as a way to potentially retrace his memory. As I mentioned before, this movie was excellent and the man behind it all is the British born director Christopher Nolan who should have bagged in some awards along the way. What's original about this movie is that the film's events are reversed. Nolan's intentions are to trace a scene from the past, which are featured in black and white. After the scene closes, the present scenes return in colour. The following scene will conclude the way the previous scene concludes. It's hard to explain, you just have to see it for yourselves to get the idea. Other strong notables in this movie are Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano who turn in equally compelling performances. The twists delivered by Nolan are out to make you go bonkers, but as the film progresses, the journey into the past will lead you to incredible discoveries revealed. Shelby's memory loss is so bad he would be the type of person to befriend a man who may have pick-pocketed him. Then after a while, he'll forget that he was pick-pocketed only if he writes it down to remember what just happened. The black and white sequences are placed to turn back the clocks to past events that lead up to the story. It's not all entirely serious though, there are some funny moments like when Shelby meets Teddy (Pantoliano) frequently and he ventures out to find people who may know him and his mental condition even though he knows what his state of mind is already. When watching the movie, we gradually grow on Shelby and realize that this man lives on repeated events that continually linger on in his mind. Everyday he thinks his wife's death was just recent. I know it's sad to see a person live a life like that, but the character study is very involving and we all hope for a miracle and that we hope he can get his full memory back. It's a bit odd that the events are told backwards, but it was still executed to perfection and succeeds to keep the audience motivated. Overall it was a crowd-pleasing success and the twists are handled subliminally. The reversed scenes were brilliant and original and the characters are a pleasure to watch. The direction by Christopher Nolan was both crisp and immaculate with an unorthodox method to his madness.",9,0,2,30 November 2009
Shakespeare in Love," Lovely Story With a Lot of Thought Put Into It
",".'Shakespeare in Love' is well-documented movie that was literally taken by the heart by those who contributed in making the movie. The story focuses on the legendary playwright and legendary stage director William Shakespeare on his quest in search for inspiration to find a potential muse that would eventually lead to one of his best written plays of all time, 'Romeo and Juliet'. It takes you the events and tragedies that inspired him to write this endearing tragedy that has to this very day being one of the greatest plays ever written. Legenday playwright Mark Norman and Tom Stoppard mentioned in the DVD features that they were always curious of what kind of a person William Shakespeare was like before he reached the iconic level.Although nobody really has an accurate portrayal of the man, we are led to assume that he was no different than anybody else who was entering in the field of writing. 'Shakespeare in Love' gives its audience the assumption that he was poorer than dirt, hungry for sex and most of all struggling to fit that final sentence into proper grammar. The historical account was very well in terms of accuracy as we get the feeling that we have stepped into the metaphoric time machine during the Elizabethan time period in England. We get the feel of the customs, the laws, the clothes and the mannerisms that the civilians of that generation lived. The DVD extras provide you with a lot of depth on what to expect in this provocative period piece.The one thing that short changed me a little bit was the lack of mentioning of the name Christopher Marlowe. For those who don't know who Mr. Marlowe, he was Shakespeare's apprentice who many also went as far to believe that he was Shakespeare's ghost writer. His life ended tragically when a tavern brawl ensued and he was beaten to death at the young age of 29. But the execution delivered here was handled so convincingly, it puts our skepticism to rest. Sure the lustful scenes at the beginning will surely fog up your lenses, but then again there are steamy romantic interludes in 'Romeo and Juliet' so this should come as no surprise.The cast features an elaborate ensemble of talented performers to make this film more real and very captivating. The leads and supports all turned in sublime performances I'm not really sure which one stood out the most. Joseph Fiennes was excellent in the titular character He is the definitive Lothario who's light on his triumphs and failures. Gwyneth Paltrow was the right ingredient for the perfect muse for what would lead to the greatest and saddest tragedies to ever hit the center stage. Paltrow herself was probably the inspiration that Norman and Stoppard needed to create their modern day masterpiece. Colin Firth shines as the manipulative, conniving villain Lord Wessex and Ben Affleck was at the top of his game as the suave thespian Ned Alleyn.Alleyn doesn't come up on the acting spectrum on his own. He has a slew of other fine thespians all vying for their big break. In the beginning of the movie, the film has a soft and gentle feeling to it. In the second half, we see a more tragic and a more involving storyline as the film goes into progression. Dame Judy Dench feels right at home in the period piece genre as her majesty Queen Elizabeth I. Her costumes are so punctual to the period it feels like they should be exhibited at the Smithsonian itself. The costumes were just one of seven Oscar nominations this movie received. Other notables include Best Screenplay (Norman and Stoppard), Best Actress (Gwyneth Paltrow), Best Supporting Actress (Dench) and three others. If you never seen it before I advise you to watch this movie. You will not be disappointed.",8,0,0,20 February 2012
Alien: Resurrection," Creature Effects Are Impressive Over A Plodding Plot
","Like every continuation of a series, 'Alien:Resurrection' has the instincts of a child who has a fit after their parents took their favourite toy away. The sketchy, slimy alien creatures and the dark, claustrophobic scenarios are curiously provocative. However, the story fails to deliver even through its hardest effort in adding a new twist in the franchise. The film itself had the right material for newly inventive ways to make the series fresh, but it never tugs at your emotions and the impact falls flatter then diluted soda. In fact I was surprised more at just how fuzzy Dan Hedaya is and he's not the main attraction here. Sure fans of the series had came into the theatres in drones and it did do quite well at the box office, but it was highly doubtful if its welcome was long termed.Sigourney Weaver is back for the fourth time returning from the dead after 200 years as a hybrid human/alien Ellen Ripley and she's still just as tough as ever battling those slimy aliens as she's been doing since 1979. It's no surprise that Weaver is in her comfort zone and still looks buff and sexy and boss for a person who's by now in her late 40's. And when she did that back basketball shot, I think she's the only person who could get away with doing that.As the franchise continues, the alien creatures continue to get more awkward each time. But the looks still have some originality each time and in this movie the aliens depicted here stand out above the rest. The inspiration for the alien creation comes from director Jean-Pierre Jeunet who got the horrific physicality of the creatures from his previous outings 'Delicatessen' and the always inviting 'The City of Lost Children'.The horrific characteristics of the film blends nicely to the dark settings, the heavy metal and the disgusting manifestations coming out of the creature's vials along with an exciting underwater scene along with the fear and the loss of humanity are just some of the spectacular traits from Jeunet's warped mind. Plus he brought his favourite actors Ron Perlman as a heavy-hitting antagonist and Dominique Pinon for some much needed comedy relief.Winona Ryder was a nice new added attraction to the series as an engineer aboard the spaceship Auriga the centrepiece to where all the fun takes place. Unfortunately 12 sniveling aliens are heading to Earth, planning to conduct evil biological experiments to the civilians.Ryder arrives on the scene with a ragtag group of smugglers seems out of place with the kind of cynical, barbaric individuals that make up the population in this franchise. Her chocolate brown eyes and her deadpan dramatic expressions has that token bright light for what has been a dark and dreary journey so far. Finally we can say this movie has a character with a small dosage of humanity.Mean is the focal characteristic in this film and the violence renders no apologies about it. We are treated to a delightful opening scene where we get an up close look at some performing open-chest surgery with barf-inducing detail with Brad Dourif as the mad doctor. The final result is that Ripley has given birth to a bouncy baby alien. You don't see that everyday that's for sure.Like every splatter fest in movies the aliens dine on delicious cuisines like guts, severed heads, and yummy brains. We also get insightful information about predatory subjects very few people talk about like predatory alien sex. Yeah 'viewer discretion advised' makes its mark here.Granted the film does have creative vibes going for it, so there's no need to go through plot details no matter how narrow it is. The thick of it all is that this film depends too much on the visuals and not much emphasis is based on the story.We get fragments of a story that Ripley returned from the dead after two hundred years and her alien child has come back as well and she's on the hunt to slay these hideous evil creatures. The aliens are still the same gross, slimy creatures we all seen before, only now they're populating.In the span of five years since the last 'Alien' film back in 1992, the special effects have truly come a long way. The transformation from archaic puppetry to the more advanced use of CGI has created a new, but not entirely for the better way of upgrading the franchise. Plus these new batch of aliens possess a more humanoid look to them and can display emotions. It's something to think about here.",7,1,1,27 February 2017
12 Monkeys," Weirdness Of Gilliam Comes Alive
","One of the functional idiosyncrasy that makes 'Twelve Monkeys' so provocative is that the entire movie is that the essential complexities is remarkably flabbergasting. Our enigmatic tale is set in the year 2035 and about over 98% of the human population has been expunged by a mysterious devastation. The densely populated humans has now took residents underground underground a relatively uninhibited premise beneath the Earth's surface. Researchers believe that the key component for humans to regain their population they must retrace the roots to the year 1996, the pivotal year when all the turmoil began. They send a volunteer named James Cole (Bruce Willis) on a dangerous initiative to go back to where all the trouble commenced to look for vital information to help correct the reason for the sudden event that lead to the decline of the human population. This isn't the first outing director Terry Gilliam has when dabbling with the Utopian future. In 1985, Gilliam has orchestrated his eccentric views with the movie 'Brazil'. He still utilizes with bizarre futuristic mechanical apparatuses here and the surreal visuals are surely like to caress your intrigue with along with baroque-styled cartoon puns that are reminiscent to his Monty Python days. With the personal assistance from director of photography Roger Pratt and production designer Jeffrey Beecroft, once again Gilliam has once again saturated our audience with another cryptic dimension with freaky metallic contraptions customized to enthrall you and freak you out at the same time.But what Gilliam does that differs from other directors is that he juxtaposes his rapturous obsession for quirkiness, adventure and the playful talent for narratives. Taken as a wink to the Jeunet and Caro film 'City of Lost Children', the visual exhibited here is visually fearsome along with a very gritty story.Cole feels that the he's been transported 6 years prior the devastation, in search of the Army of Twelve Monkeys, a faction of scientists from the future who has revealed an intoxicating virus that led to the current problems. Cole ends up institutionalized in a psychiatric ward under the supervision of Dr. Kathryn Railly (Madeline Stowe). When she listens to his assignment, she thinks he's lost it and demands to get medicated. He manages to escape when get warped back in time thanks to his futuristic keepers. Not completely defeated, Cole manages to seek answers from an inmate named Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt), a schizophrenic individual who also is an animal protector. Transported to 1996, Cole finds that Jeffrey's father Dr. Goines (Christopher Plummer) is a well- renown virologist who's been experimenting with animals. When Dr. Railly decides that Cole is not insane, decides to go with assisting him on his mission. During Cole's missionary duty, the memories of his childhood seem to haunt him for reasons unknown until the end keeping us guessing by scriptwriters David and Janet Peoples we come to the conclusion that futuristic scientists are often misguided with what happened in our time frame.Like many of Gilliam's other films it never feels like any of the films he makes look like recycled from other films which is to me the highest compliments. But as a specialist n his respected craft, Gilliam knows how to really connect quite well with his respected performers. Pitt who at the time was becoming an up and coming star showed more exuberance here than his incredible supporting performance in 'Thelma and Louise'. As Goines, we can see Pitt was starting to show that he was more primed for more leading roles. It was a bit of a shame that Madeline Stowe was not offered very much to here. She has truly a lot to offer here, but has been relegated to playing a very minor role when yet here talent is beyond the surface to her performance in other roles. The star Bruce Willis is just as focused and intense like he is in his 'Die Hard' films. Cole is the perfect decoy who's lost in the life that was given to him. He was born at a time where being alive was not good timing. He can still be witty and charming, but he's still a pariah which makes him apologetically a victim and a hero who's yearning for our sympathy.",9,1,2,9 May 2016
Stripes," The Laughter Makes Up For The Silly Plot
","To me I feel that 'Stripes' reminds me a lot like the classic Army comedy 'Private Benjamin' with Bill Murray taking the place of Goldie Hawn with only a few distinctive differences. Hawn didn't really know very much about the Army or the many regiments and training you have to go through to make it in the Army. While Bill Murray's Pvt. John Winger seems to know a lot about the Army protocols and the many ways he could outsmart and outwit his superiors. To me, his sardonic humour is played quite effectively and might be one of the reasons why this movie is really good. Back in 1981, Illinois native Bill Murray was pretty much in his third year gracing the silver screen with witty charm, cynical humour and manipulative tactics to outsmart practically anyone crossing his path. After donning his craft on sketch comedies like 'Saturday Night Live' and the Canadian equivalent 'SCTV', Murray has churned up a string full of off-the-wall comedies like 'Meatballs', 'Caddieshack' and 'Stripes' being his third one shows that his flair for slapstick comedy is just a natural thing for him. Why spoil a good thing? Right?The opening scenes features Winger who after a few hours loses his job as a cab driver, his girlfriend dumps him and a basketball ricochets through his window. Feeling like there's nowhere to turn to, he enlists in the Army. He also tries to persuade his brilliant friend Russell Ziskey (Harold Ramis) who's an English teacher to foreign students. The duo collaborates and writes their own set of Army protocols much to the chagrin of the hard-nosed Sgt. Hulka (Warren Oates who hasn't acted in while due to poor health). Murray seems to be permanently liberal in points of view towards the people surrounding him, both superior and inferior to him. He's not afraid to speak his mind out about you, even if it's not very flattering. When Hulka get shot, Winger arbitrarily steps up to the plate and commands the other recruits and these are where the funny bits of the movie comes to effect. Unfortunately, like 'Private Benjamin', 'Stripes' gets lost out of focus near the middle of the film. In 'Private Benjamin', the film lost its charm once the feminist message comes across while they were in Europe. In 'Stripes' the film gets bogged down one he goes on a mission in Europe. If they would've stuck to the slapstick elements it was intended for, the movie would've been much better. Winger's initiative was to operate on the very first mechanized armoured vehicle, before it gets underway, Winger and Ziskey hijack the RV and goes behind the Iron Curtain and they become lustful towards two female MP's (Sean Young and P.J. Soles). If the focus was on these four characters, it would have worked out in the long run. Instead it concentrates on the ridiculous mud wrestling scenes and the RV hijacking. The final product becomes deplorably infantile and takes away the intrigue that both Murray and Ramis carry throughout the film as likable obnoxious characters. I liked it when Pvt. Winger verbally lashes down at the recruits and belittles their background upbringings.The late John Candy a long-time alum from 'SCTV' fame comes here on his own as Pvt. Dewey Oxberger and he's more than just a friendly heavy- set guy, he's an ally of Winger's and his comedic wit is equally effective and rivals nice with Murray's.",7,0,0,26 July 2015
The English Patient," Powerhouse Love Story
","Many filmmakers had lost the true meaning of effective powerfully executed love stories delivered with passion and depth. Under the direction of Anthony Minghella, 'The English Patient' has resurrected the romantic drama by not dependent on just the direction itself (though Minghella won the Oscar for Best Director) but the clever script by Minghella, undeniable performances with pitch-perfect dialogue, flawless camera work that has sweeping levels of erotica mixed with an emotional connectivity you don't see in a lot of in movies.Sure it's grandeur in terms of melodramatic intentions, but it does a service to the movie as opposed to just rubbing it into our faces, which makes it effective instead of manipulative. Put in the rightful hands of writer/director Anthony Minghella based on the award-winning novel by Michael Ondaatje, Minghella brings the romance between Almasy (Ralph Fiennes) and Katherine (Kristin Scott Thomas) to life so naturally, it feels like they are living the parts and not just memorizing their lines.The opening scenes are set in World War II as we see a fighter plane from Great Britain being shot down in the deserts of North Africa. The pilot is a Hungarian Count named Laszlo Almasy (Fiennes) who survived the ordeal, but suffered terrible wounds. We meet Laszlo again in Italy in 1944, his wounds have healed up nicely, but happiness isn't going his way. He is terminally ill and has lapsed into memory loss. A weary Canadian nurse named Hana (Juliette Binoche) escorts Laszlo to a secluded peaceful church to live out his last days. While fueling his veins with morphine and reading volumes from his favourite author Herodotus, Hana is determined to regain Laszlo's memories back. They are not alone in this church as company started coming which includes a mysterious crippled soldier named Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe) who's agenda remains esoteric and two bomb analysts that include British Sgt. Hardy (Kevin Whatley) and his Sikh assistant, Kip (Naveen Andrews) who falls in love with Hana.The story is executed through a series of flashbacks used effectively, Laszlo starts to make progress in his memories, though Caravaggio believes that Laszlo is not an amnesiac, but just wants to forget what really happened. The story shifts between the present and the events that happened during the 1930's and 1940's when Laszlo was on a map-making mission while on assignment in the Sahara, that was where he meets Katherine Clifton (Scott-Thomas) who's husband (Colin Firth) is part of this initiative. This sets the bar for Laszlo and Katherine to fall head over heals with each other while in the midst of some serious Nazi ruthlessness.If there was a red herring about 'The English Patient' is that Laszlo's dying scenes are not as etched out as his flashback sequences. The romantic entanglements between Hana and Kip is way underdeveloped due mostly because they are not fleshed out characters. Therefore, the scenes in the present are really there for filler.Performance wise Ralph Fiennes was excellent as Laszlo another film that Fiennes likes to challenge himself with and here he's put to the test in a very complex role as a strong, introverted type until the right woman comes along and sweeps him off his feet. Kristin Scott-Thomas shines as Laszlo's love interest as she conveys beauty along with just the right amount of poise and energy that Laszlo finds hard to resist.Though her role was minimal, Juliette Binoche is still effective in her performance as Hana. William Dafoe adds just the right amount of intensity in his performance like he does in all his movies which he's pretty good at. Rounding out the notable supporting characters are Naveen Andrews as Kip, Colin Firth as Katherine's husband and Julian Wadham as Laszlo's friend Madox.It's rare to find intelligent epic romantic tales play out so convincingly these days. The thoughts drawn out in this movie will likely have a lingering effect on the viewers once the credits roll. It's one of those films that hits you when you watch it and it hits you once the film ends. This film came right out by award season and rightfully so after spending eight months with bad to mediocre film. This film truly saves the day.",9,1,1,26 March 2018
Happy Gilmore," Back In a Time When Sandler Was More Risky
","Back in the 1990's there was a time when Adam Sandler was one of the leading funny men. The two standout films that starred Adam Sandler at the time was 'Billy Madison' and this one here 'Happy Gilmore'.was the metaphoric jumper cable that electrified Mr. Sandler's acting career. For the past decade and a half, Sandler's movies have been simple in plot, but they are never short on entertainment and you become quite passive over the surreal moments. 'Happy Gilmore is by far no exception to the rule.Sandler stars as Happy Gilmore, a young energetic hockey player with a big problem, he can't skate. Happy is raised by his grandmother after his father was killed after a severe slap shot to the head. When government officials discover that his grandmother owes them $270,000 in taxes. they raid her house and repossess every on of her belongings that even includes the house. And that they'll only get it back if they can find a way to pay the money they owe.With his hockey career being null and void, Happy seems his chances of getting back her loot is virtually impossible. As the movers carry their possessions, one of the moving men starts up a bet to Happy that happy couldn't strike a golf ball farther than him. Much to even Happy's surprise he actually has the amazing ability to to drive the ball well over 400 yards. This inspires Happy who continues to gain impressions on spectators including Chubbs (Carl Weathers) who was an ex golfer whose career was cut short by an alligator bite. on his hand.Chubbs persuades Happy to compete in a local tournament and if he succeeds, he will be eligible to compete in the PGA tournament. And so Happy emerges victorious and brings a volatile demeanour and mean drive as well as a very strong fan following. But his short-tempered attitude almost gets him kicked off the tournament due to his gratuitous cursing and destroying clubs. With the help from Chubbs he progressively tones down his act and even his payroll starts to materialize. During the tournament, Happy becomes a hated rival by a top player named Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald) McGavin takes the sport seriously while at the same time looks down on all the competitors due to his condescending nature.There is not very much thought put into the movie, but that could all be forgiven because it's hilarious and brilliantly scripted. and after 'Billy Madison' this is the second funniest film that Sandler ever performed. This is definitely a movie you don't want to miss out. It's hilarious, easy to follow along and even if you don't like golf it's still fun to watch.",8,4,5,30 July 2013
Elizabeth," Good Film With Its Fair Share of Flaws
","I have been fascinated with Tudor history, but I when watching a film about the Tudor era, I was not expecting an accurate historical account. When I saw 'Elizabeth' in 1998, I came to see some riveting performances, beautiful costumes gorgeous settings and stunning direction. I never let historical inaccuracies get in the way, because from my experience I know perfectly well that entertainment and historical facts don't collide very well in the Hollywood vacuum.Cate Blanchett was spectacular as the titular character. She just seemed natural for the role, both physically and mentally in character. However, I found the portrayal to be at times a bit uptight at times when it would have been more stimulating if she was more stone-cold. But I guess the Hollywood community wanted to emphasis on the uptight psyche that shines upon Elizabeth's inner struggles. I guess it's more complex to play a laid-back stone-faced queen while being manifested with inner anxiety.I was turned off the scene where Elizabeth was engaged in coitus with Sir Robert Dudley (Joseph Fiennes) while her ladies catch them in the act. I might assume this is a hook by Hollywood to include a romantic entanglement in this Tudor film. However, I found the scene to be grotesque because for the sake of decency, they should have made their sexual entanglement to be a little more private.The scene where Elizabeth comes together as a monarch and uses low-key manipulative tactics towards her Parliament was executed to absolute perfection. Blanchett adds just the right touch of diffidence and nobleness along with subliminal humour to make this scene all the more effective. Elizabeth's shrugging over marriage is quite vocal and very determined fearing that if she should tie the knot, she will lose her powers as the top of the monarchy. The various scenes where our pale-faced majesty starts losing her grip on reality towards her power by consorting towards unremorseful and emotionally distant are brilliantly exhibited.My main desire was to have Elizabeth deliver a more devilish charm while at the same time keeping if more subtle. On a historical basis, she did treat her suitors like puppets as she solely structured her country's defenses in order to gain her independence, but the low-key elements were not properly exhibited here. On a regular basis, she barks out that she will never wed and there was very little in terms of the Spanish suitor who's infamous Armada did not fare very well against Elizabeth's powerful Navy. I was disappointed this chain of events never materialized in the script.Sure I may have done a rant a bit here, but overall the movie was not entirely terrible. It was entertainingly satisfying with plenty of historical references to please people who are aficionados of the Tudor Era period pieces. I guess this movie to me would be a onetime deal for me because there were several flaws about it.",6,1,1,27 January 2014
Ice Age: The Meltdown," A Reflection ToThe Worries of Global Warming In Our Modern Era
","It seems that the only character who was able to maintain his character fresh while adding new dimensions was the sabre-toothed squirrel named Scrat (Chris Wedge). Sadly the other characters in 'Ice Age: The Meltdown' were placed in subplots and conflicts that was not up to par from the first installment. It's strange that after tens of thousands of years has past since the first installment of the series that most of the gang are still together, but I will suspend my disbelief being that it's an animated film or else I'll be scratching by head in puzzlement the whole way through.In the opening scenes in this sequel, we find the acorn obsession Scrat who by way of default, is first to notice that the skies above and the landscape they inhabit looks very murky and that global change is only a motion away. Which makes sense as Scrat is wondering where's the oak tree was it that this elusive acorn fell from? As the squirrel is climbing an ice wall, the little critter almost plunges to his death, but is saved when his tongue gets stuck on the ice. As this is happening, the glacier starts melting as a stream of water comes pouring around it.If your young ones weren't concerned about the effects of global warming, this film will surely make them more aware.Giant icebergs start falling into sea, water levels are at an all time high and the wildlife though the characters use their resourcefulness to prevent drowning, others are not so lucky. There's a saying within their confides that a hollow log is in the valley and if they can float on that log, they will make it to safety.The characters from the previous film have managed to live together harmoniously though from a logical standpoint what do the carnivores do when it comes to their meals? Aside from the Scrat, we have the other mammals who have subplots, but they're not as focused as this global catastrophe that's going on right now. We have Manny the wholly mammoth (Ray Romano) who feels the like he's the last of his species until he meets Ellie (Queen Latifah) who might be able to help save their species if only Manny can convince her she's not a possum. She was adopted in a possum family and has two adopted brothers Crash and Eddie (Seann William Scott and Josh Peck). Then we have Diego the sabre-toothed tiger (Denis Leary) who's facing his fear of water and Sid the Sloth (John Leguizamo) who gets crowned king of the sloths only thing is the sloths who crowned him want to throw him into a volcano. also in support are Fast Tony the Turtle (Jay Leno) and Lone Gunslinger the Vulture (Will Arnett).Once we meet the characters and the ice shelf starts to melt, the adventures start to take off from there. The trek is long and dangerous as we see the thawing of two large carnivorous marine sea monsters that look they will evolve i into sharks. Plus there's a scene involving of an ice bridge that's on the brink of collapsing which was a nod to the bridge scene from 'Lord of the Rings'.In the end, 'Ice Age: The Meltdown', is nice to look at in terms of colours and details. The animals were interesting in terms of their interactions with each other and have provocative subplots (though not fully developed). The action runs at a quick pace. Though the kids might have a blast with this movie, the adults might enjoy it quite less. The first 'Ice Age' movie shuffled the the characters like whirlwind, but in 'The Meltdown', the characters were watered down quite a bit. Most of the film is about trying to co-exist in a world that's changing right in front of them. From a cartoon standpoint yes. And if global warming is to ensure they're adapting to warm weather and plenty more acorns for Scrat, then problem solved.",7,1,1,4 March 2019
Insomnia," Excellent Remake Of A Norwegian Thriller
","Set in the isolated Alaskan village of Nightmute where daylight and darkness is split six months apart, 'Insomnia' tells the tale about the murder of a young girl and assigned to the job are Los Angeles Detective Will Dormer (Al Pacino) and Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan). Looking frazzled and weary once getting off the plane, Dormer knows trouble awaits him. With internal affairs determined to end his career, the idea of solving a murder in the Alaskan middle of nowhere has gotten this grizzled veteran things can't get any worst. Or can they?Feeling that all hope is lost, his junior Detective Eckhart is more than propelled to tell internal affairs only to put the old man out pasture with them blackmailing him with immunity much to the chagrin of Dormer. They fly into Nightmute via two-engine prop plane they are assisted by a relatively rookie cop Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank) who's still a bit lacking in experience as a cop. Following the box office success of his first film 'Memento', director Christopher Nolan goes out of his way to make this 1998 Norwegian remake of the same name by Erik Skjoldbjaerg. The original film, for a psychological drama it is powerful, intense and quite heavy-handed in details. This one is is no exception. What's different from most remakes is that 'Insomnia' doesn't just lazily redo every scene from beginning and end but instead re-evaluates it making this movie original in its delivery. Pacino's approach seems to be taking his role in a more physical approach as opposed to Stellan Skarsgard's character from the original film. How much more does this man have to endure? The surprise twists really comes to life once the third acts comes into fruition which includes a character we don't really expect coming at us. Like both films, the development is very important only this version fans out quite better as an added bonus, it has more dimension.Unlike the Norwegian version, this remake revised by original writers Skjoldbjaerg and Nickolaj Frobenius along with scriptwriter Hilary Seitz, the killer comes into the story under a low-prolific way as sort-of a quiet sidekick to Det. Dormer. By now people may have totally overlooked the fact that Robin Williams was in this movie. Here he plays Walter Finch, whom he doesn't admit of being a murderer, even though it was barbaric and violent. Hey, we all slip from time to time don't we? We all deserve a bit of redemption now don't we? Dormer remains restless in a village that barely sees sundown feels like he'sin a precarious situation. By arresting Finch, Dormer will be victim of his own cover. Dormer believes something scheming is going on. It's obscure that a thriller focuses on moral issues and feelings of shame and guilt, but Nolan doesn't ignore Hollywood requirements that all thrillers doesn't end in an epic shoot-out near the end. There are some memorable exciting scenes like chase across the floating logs and another where a character is drowning underwater. It may be exciting, but was it necessary? Not while the psychological elements are very high I just don't think high-flying action was really needed in this calibre of a film. Wiiliams and Pacino have great chemistry with each other and the reason for that is because Det. Dormer can visualize his visage to his antagonists in a sea of self-deception. The two contrasting characters are what character-studies are all about. Here we see Dormer, over-whelmed, fatigued, sporting dark circles around his eyes and just lacking in composure. While Finch is the smooth operator here as a guy convinced of his own case. Along with 'On Hour Photo' which also was previewed at the Sundance Festival that same year, really shows that even though throughout most his career, Williams starred in mostly comedies, he is also quite able to play dramatic roles quite convincingly. Why Nolan took the liberty to direct this remake was that 'Memento' was truly a one of a kind. Attempting to make another film like that could be tiresome. 'Insomnia' is film that shows even crime can happen even in the most remote places in the world making this film all the more original. It also shows that many eyes are onto Pacino's character, no matter where he is, paranoia is everywhere leaving him with very few to trust and few to seek reassurance.",9,1,3,2 August 2015
500 Days of Summer," A More Realistic Look Into the Romantic Comedy
","We have all been through that familiar path before. Just when we thought we found the guy/girl of our dreams and they connect with each other and have similar shares with each other and hopes that a simple platonic relationship could progressively enhance into something beyond those parameters. And then, after a while the inevitable happens and then one of them breaks up with you and it takes many frustrating leaps and bounds to ask them to take them back only to realize that they were meant to be together. Until finally we come to realize that you might succeed or might fail, but in the end the end, there's always room for hope. '(500) Days of Summer' tells a very familiar story about Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who works at a greeting card company and Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel) his co-worker who seems like a nice couple as they're seated on a bench with her hand on top of his complete with a beautiful ring on her finger. Before you know it, as the film progresses we discover that Tom and Summer have ended their relationship and Tom has not taken this very well. While battling depression and heartbreak, Tom's friends have tried to offer him support and his lovable sister Rachel (Chloe Grace Moretz) provide reassurance as a way to prevent him from going into deeper depression for fear he might self-destruct. One of the things that might get fans peeved off about this movie is the fact that it doesn't operate on a formulaic day-to-day chronological events. The narrative is quite non-linear so therefore, scenes will jump over various intervals as the film rolls. Just remember you've been warned. We know that they're co- workers at the greeting card company. They have a few drinks, get wild at a karaoke party and Summer seems to be attracted to his enthusiasm even though she has really no intentions of hooking up with anyone. All the while Tom pretends like he's not interested in her either for the fear of doing something embarrassing or stupid or something he might regret. And who has never done that before?The triumphs and setbacks in Tom and Summer's relationship is the cornerstone of what the entire movie is about. We know that Summer has been turned off by Tom for some time and the quirky charm that once attracted Summer has fizzled out like a flower in late August. We see Tom looking back the magical time when they first met. But he still can't get over the fact that she never intended their relationship to be anything more than just friends. The performances were all very good, even though there really isn't any top quality A-list performers, but they're all bright and likable and we truly care about each character. Joseph Gordon-Levitt shows just how versatile he is as a performer and really has come on his own from his early days in misunderstood movies like the 'The Juror' to his comedy roots on 'Third Rock From the Sun'. Zooey Deschanel can always tempt you with her sparkly cuteness while embodying her independence as Summer. I also though that by making the story non-linear was clever on the part of director Marc Webb which adds a dimension of freshness by preventing this story from becoming wanton. That way we can keep guessing if Tom will ever win back Summer's heart. And while keeping it real, while maintaining the humour fresh, and the overwhelming roller coaster of events might not please everyone but the realism behind it is purely justified. In the unpredictable world we live in they say there is someone for everyone, but we don't know exactly how and were Tom and Summer meant to be together? Even Tom himself doesn't really know. What really stands out about this movie is the amazing music score by Mychael Danna and Rob Simonsen. It's filled with some wonderful tracks from well established artists like The Smiths, Wolfmother, Rebecca Spektor, Simon and Garfunkel, Hall and Oates among others that are light for a romantic comedy, but the artists are familiar names which is good, because too many romantic comedies have musician we never heard about which makes it very annoying. Overall, '(500) Days of Summer' was a nice little romantic comedy you could watch and get involved with the characters in it. It wasn't formulaic, sappy and didn't make you want to stab yourself with a fork. And the realism involved towards the theme that love can be unpredictable rings true. It may bring happiness, it may bring heartbreak, but either way this message is saying that even when you're down you must look for ways to get yourself back into the race.",9,0,0,11 July 2016
Juno," A Great Journey Based On Decisions We Make In Life
","'Juno' stars Ellen Page as young adolescent Juno MacGuff who's very witty in character and very cool in her ways of life. She resides with her father Mac (J. K. Simmons) and her stepmother Bren (Allison Janney) and lives off a strict way in how she behaves and how she talks. She attends a school in Minnesota and has a laconic boyfriend named Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera) who one day had sex with her which resulted in her getting pregnant. Now she's in a tough situation in which she must decide where to go from here. At first, Juno contemplates on aborting the child, but it is her friend Leah (Olivia Thirlby) who suggests getting Juno to find suitable parents who will adopt the child and to provide a loving home for him or her. The parents that Juno comes across are Mark and Vanessa Loring (Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner). At first glance it seems like the perfect choice, only to later discover, it's not all as simple as it comes.What makes 'Juno' stand out is that it succeeds in remaining fresh, original, sincere and characters we can all relate to with enough material and character development to get the audience into these individuals life. Under the direction from Jason Reitman who previously directed 'Thank You For Smoking' has brought wit, humour, provocative scenes and a coming-of-age journey where a young teenage girl now has the toughest decision she's ever had. Even as absurd and surreal as this story can be at times, the social commentary about teen pregnancy is handled with caution and care by Ellen Page who was nominated for an Oscar for her performance.Although the topic of teen pregnancy and the dominating performance by Page carries the film, the other cast and crew deserve some special attention as well. Diablo Cody in her screenwriting debut did an incredible job in providing real characters facing real situations and speaking out towards youth about the struggles in making the hardest decisions in your life and what results will come into effect. Juno is quite a cool character and yet she remains attached to an awkward kid like Paulie who seems to spend most of the movie sporting a gym uniform with colours maroon and yellow. And sure her choice in men are questionable, we can get past that just like her decision to give her child up for adoption from potential parents from a classified ad she skimmed through.This story can be a bit predictable in the end, but at least what's refreshing is how the scenes pan out. The people in Juno's life have varying degrees in how she interacts which may not always be logical, but still provocative. The supporting cast also deliver great performances. Simmons is wonderful as the fair but firm father. Janney is excellent as the strongly opinionated stepmother. Bateman is convincing as Mark the man-child who writes commercial jingles, and Garner as his wife willing to the commitment in raising a child. And Cera is still charming as the awkward crush who has a level of kindness. With its steady flow of one-liners, the jokes are not designed for shock. But through this journey we experienced the joys, the laughter and the tears and the angst with a solid message that never goes preachy. Not all journey's end with rewarding results. I'm just glad, this one did.",8,0,0,23 July 2019
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," The Best of the Series So Far
","Two years ago when the third 'Pirates of the Caribbean' came out, I was expecting the continuation of where it left off with the same style we have become adjusted to. Boy was I wrong and for good reasons too. 'Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End' goes beyond what a expected from a three parter movie as the series seems to get better as it ages, like a fine wine. As the story continues, Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush)along with Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley)and company attempt to rescue Capatin Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) who's held captive in Davy Jones(Bill Nighy) Locker. While this is happening, the evil Lord Cutler Beckett is going out of his way eradicating one pirate after another bringing them down on the brink of extinction. Cutler who's in possession of Davy Jones' heart, has employed the Flying Dutchman to annihilate the surviving pirates in the area which brings the pirates to band together to take down Cutler and Jones for a grueling battle in which fate is in the hands between the characters.What's original from the other two 'Pirates of the Caribbean' movies is that is that the campy humor is replaced by a more darker setting. Even the visuals are replaced with a dramatic feel and a complex story to it.The format of the the story in 'At World's End' is more like a real tale told in contrast to its predecessors being that it isn't about ghouls and treasures, but rather standing united to take down what could possibly of a threat of being diminished by a greater evil. It also teaches the valuable lessons in unity and how we should behave as a group when dire consequences comes into play. People may not like this new adjustment in favor of mindless pirate adventure fun, but to me I liked the new realistic approach to the series as it provides a refreshing feel to the story, where the life of a pirate isn't all fun and games. Some of the characters from the previous installment become darker in personality gives you a feeling that unpredictable notion as to who will live and who will die. The direction was a joy to watch, even though the movie is 2 hours and 45 minutes, never once is it ever boring. I'm glad there was little editing done and was never once shortened just to satisfy those people who have short attention spans. It's the end of the series, so it would naturally be long. So I give a hats off to Gore Verbinski for creating a masterpiece. The camera work was extremely skillful as every pivotal scene is captured in all its beauty, especially the waterfront scene. The desert scene with Captain Sparrow was kind of creepy but effective. Even the music heard in the background is enough to give you goosebumps. The acting was breath-taking especially Johnny Depp who's flamboyant nature as Captain Jack Sparrow is one of the the many elements that have remained untouched. But the other performers turned in amazing performances. Geoffrey Rush is still scene stealing as Capatain Hektor Barbossa. And Tom Hollander has more screen time as the evil pirate slayer Lord Cutler Beckett. Composer Hans Zimmer jumps a few hurdles here by composing a score that will keep you mesmerized and never falls in the category as boring or cheesy. And by adding new themes is also a valuable asset as well. The score makes everything just come alive here. To summarize, this movie exceeds the other two by lowering the CGI's and the cheap laughter that a plethora of other summer blockbusters possess. The dark content and the complex story is plausible. And the scenes featured here can be very creepy and isolated at times. Though not set to please everyone, the changes borough to this movie is pure magic,in every possible way, from the cinematography to the acting to the remarkable score. This one will leave you with a satisfying aftertaste.",9,1,3,14 April 2009
Milk," Less About Coming Out But More About Chasing Your Dreams
","When it comes to biopics, the thing that stands out for me is the feeling I'm entering the lives of another person's life and hoping that I cab get a bigger picture of that person and get a better understanding of their triumphs and failures in hope that if I meet a person similar to that character I would feel more confident if ever I should approach them. The 2008 Oscar winning film 'Milk' directed by Gus Van Sant follows the the remaining eight eventful years of Harvey Milk's life as he makes the transition from a complete unknown to a being one the first openly gay political official as part of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. As I mentioned in the title, 'Milk' isn't entirely on coming out as gay during a time when homosexuality wasn't tolerated but more of chasing your dreams to reach your fullest potential regardless of what obstacles stand in your way.Back in 2008, 'Milk' was given a plethora of accolades in the film industry most noteworthy being the sublime performance by Sean Penn as the titular character. With the make-up, costumes and molding of his character traits, Penn wasn't just playing Harvey Milk, he was Harvey Milk. His character was portrayed as a calmly spoken, idealistic novice politician who overcame incredible odds like standing up to the government giants while tackling the prejudices he faced in his personal life. In keeping the balance between his work and home, it was his job to cater to the emotional needs of his partner Scott Smith (James Franco) as he discover the world has become more public and that he made it his decision to pun for a political office as time and ambition was drawing near. After many years of Franco starring in a stream of action films and comedy it was great to see him in a more dramatic film and he pulled it off flawlessly.Aside from Penn and Franco's performances, the supporting characters are also quite effective in not only their acting, but by their physical characteristics as well. Josh Brolin was effective as Milk's fellow colleague and rival Dan White and the chilling tale of his character is quite the thing that'll make your skin crawl. Emile Hirsch as Harvey's associates Cleve Jones was effective, though his screen time was limited.After the events that happened here between 1970-1978, it has been maybe only recently that North America has found more acceptance to the LGBT community and has made great strides in helping these individuals be happy with the skin they own and not have to live in fear and despair. Harvey Milk was a man who set out on a journey to overcome the odds to help his people prosper and to stand proud and open up and to say there are millions out there like him and they're not afraid of who they are and no one else should be. By coming out and admitting one's orientation was the pivotal step for one to crush the walls of homophobia and that everyone must co-exist. If more people were to accept those and not judge, the world would be a better place.I liked how Van Sant utilized archive footage to the film which adds authenticity to the narrative giving this film a dose of realism to the script. In this way he's doing it as a contribution to the cause as opposed to just arbitrarily pasting it into the scenes. The approach here has a more caring side to it contrary to being preachy and just unmercifully rubbing it in our faces.Change can be good or bad depending on one's point of view, and the goal that Harvey Milk embarked on was that he wasn't asking for a lot, but just wanted the world to be a little more accepting and a lot less negative and his dreams was not just to make homosexual people's life a little more caring for the world around them but to have a strong leader in the political spectrum to stand up for them. Sure the theme is on homosexual acceptance, but in this big world we live in we face struggles in every aspect of life making 'Milk' a more universally themed movie.",9,0,2,18 June 2018
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Great Improvent Than The First Part
","After watching the first 'Hellboy' movie, I though it was one of the most oddest movie I ever saw. Sure I enjoyed it immensely, I though there were a few quips that needed more further explaining. But I digress to say that it succeeded into capturing a fantasy and making it as real as possible. 'Hellboy II: The Golden Army' steps up the ante an extra foot to let it's audience enter into a world of magical creatures, awesome heroes, and colorful villains plenty of jam-packed adventures that should keep every 'Hellboy' fan intrigued.The smooth-flowing introduction reveals his origins and a fairy tale about an epic battle where humans engaged in a war with the magical creatures over land that opened up for an elite group known as The Golden Army.After the extreme rubble that the army has done, the King makes a pact with the humans by letting them reside in the cities, while the creatures have complete access to the forest. The Crown which was in the army's possession has been split into three pieces and the Army was then buried. Prince Nuada (the Woodland King's son) abandons the area, and will only return if ever needed by the villagers. The fairy tale story is presented with an immaculate fashion, but the character development has improved immensely from it predecessor, and that every character in this story enjoys their little fun in the sun.Not one character, big or small usurps anyone. The relationship between Hellboy and Liz (Ron Perlman and Selma Blair). The chemistry between them goes beyond the parameters of love at first sight as their commitment is more panned out. However, a quarrel takes shape which eventually breaks into an ungodly inferno. Doug Jones' Abe Sapien gets more screen time and falls smitten over Princess Nuala, (Nuada's twin sister)and one of the keepers of the broken crown. It's great that Abe is more involved in the story than just a mere sidekick. Newbie to the story is Johan Krauss also has plenty of moments for himself and becomes a formidable protagonist to the heroes. The only weak link is Jeffrey Tambor who's just a low-key comic foil as an agent assigned to watch over the veil of secrecy that they abide by.The best character of the ensemble of characters is the Prince Nuada mostly due to the complexities of his personality. If he wanted to, he could have been the typical evil villain, but I see him as a misunderstood individual who conducts rightful things in an evil way because that's how he accomplishes things. It's such a refreshing break from all the other tiring clichéd video-game reject villains who's conquer the world purposes get to be tiring and repetitive. Here we see a villain who's actually not trying to be powerful for his own selfish agenda, but for the sake of others.The sequel to 'Hellboy' expands more in the creature and special effect market thanks brilliantly to creature specialist Guillermo del Toro who directed this movie. It's good that the effects looked more real as opposed to the cheesy computer graphics that has been plaguing our screens for years.The characters come on when the scenes were needed of them and everything was handled nuanced. Even the masterful score of Danny Elfman contributes as the story progresses.In the end 'Hellboy II: The Golden Army' makes for a satisfying movie that's more complete than the first installment that unites the real and surreal very subtle that will surely please everyone of all ages and never insults your intelligent. And look out for the amazing Barry Manilow number too.",8,1,5,8 February 2010
Snatch," Gypsies Tramps and Thieves And One Dog
","Following through the success of 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels', Guy Ritchie may have very well outdone himself here. What usurps this film compared to Ritchie's previous outing is that 'Snatch' has more comedy provided. And even though there are more characters provided the story is far more easy-going.Our journey begins with a boxing promoter named Turkish (Jason Statham) and his business accomplice Tommy (Stephen Graham) are privately talking about diamonds. As the credits get underway,in Antwerp, Belgium we see four thieves going incognito as Jewish men as they make their ways to the eighth floor of a building. Once they reached the floor, the thieves now have possession of an 84 carot diamond. The leader, Franky Four Fingers (Benicio Del Toro) leads the troop as he delivers the diamond to his cousin Avi (Dennis Farina). He has days to spare in London where he's asked to meet Boris the Blade (Rade Serbedzija) to obtain a gun from him and place a bet on a crooked boxing match. Franky handcuffs his hand with the diamond placed on his hand in a briefcase, when suddenly the van was hit and he was out cold.In another subplot (that spells Tarantino), Turkish and Tommy have signed on a gifted, but brainless boxer name 'Gorgeous' (Adam Fogerty). Turkish and Tommy purchased a caravan from a band of gypsies, oblivious to the fact that easily breaks down the minute they purchased it. While demanding for a refund, George demands a fight with 'One Punch' Mickey O'Neill (Brad Pitt) and if he wind they will get their refund. But Mickey easily knock out George, which leads to Turkish negotiating with Brick Top (Alan Ford) if they recruit Mickey in exchange for George. But will only do it if Mickey goes down in the fourth.The third subplot has Boris not being able to get any communication from Franky, so he asks Sol (Lennie James) along with Vincent and Tyrone (Robbie Gee and Ade) to get in touch with him. When they finally reach him, he's been shot unintentionally and tribulations come into full effect when the dog enter the fray.The performances were overall very enjoyable. Jason Statham has one-upped himself here and plays a more prominent role here. Brad Pitt is really fascinating as a gypsy who talks incoherently. Alan Ford truly was delightful as a crime boss and Benicio Del Toro was remarkable as a thief who suffers from a horrible gambling addiction. He truly makes up for his role, even though it's quite limited. Ritchie's direction has improved greatly from 'Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels'. The shots delivered are more bigger and the boxing scene is very well produced.The script was quite impressive in humour and wit. The story may have numerous subplots, but it flows along very easily and is not hard to follow. It's also very rewarding to see it many times and it never gets stale, plus you see new things through every viewing. It's good that three cast members from its predecessor returns a second time through.Like 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels', the soundtrack has a variety of songs like old school Jewish music to more modernized (at least early 21st century music) like Oasis. What steps up in 'Snatch' is the quicker pace and the action never once slows down and never overdoes it with the plot twists. I think between the two Guy Ritchie films, this one is much more compelling. The key component to why it's better is that there's more characters to get to know and you have a better understanding to where each one of them is coming from. The only gripe I have with this movie is the length. It's a bit too short. And it's not a burden to the film, but many characters who I enjoyed didn't get enough screen time, so I was hoping it would have been longer.This movie overall, stands out for a near perfect film. Even for a heist movie, the performances and the script also stood out. The plot is enigmatic as one subplot overlaps with another like 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels'. Even though the setting of the movie is in London, England and a bit in Antwerp Belgium but wouldn't it be cool if it was set in New York? What more can I say? Watch the film, I guarantee you won't be disappointed.",9,0,3,25 August 2014
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," It Delivers What It Promises
","In 19th century London, a town barber who goes by the name Benjamin Barker (Johnny Depp) is wed to a beautiful wife named Lucy (Laura Michelle Kelly)and they have a lovely daughter named Johanna (Jayne Wisener). Lucy's good looks catches the eyes of crooked Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) who feels that she should be in his arms. So, he cooks up a scheme to have Barker thrown in jail for a criminal act he didn't commit. Fifteen years later, Barker is released from prison, with a new look, a new attitude and most importantly, a new identity, Sweeney Todd. His plot is to get even with the callous Turpin. Hoping to reconcile with his wife, Todd gets word from a local baker who specializes in meat pies Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter) that his wife, Lucy killed herself years ago and that Turpin has custody over Johanna. In a plot for revenge, Sweeney returns to the barber business by opening a shop below Lovett's bakery and this time plotting revenge against those who enter his shop by slicing their throats and using their remains to make meat pies out of their flesh as a ploy to get to Turpin and end his madness once and for all. The script adapted from the original musical by Stephen Sondheim speaks for itself. The dark, Gothic atmosphere, and the scintillating lighting is complimented by the brilliant direction by Tim Burton. Johnny Deep has never been more creepier since Edward Scissorhands and Icabod Crane. You may think that Sweeney's revenge is taken in vain, but in reality, he's hurting inside and badly too over the loss of his lover and soul-mate, Lucy. Even though I'm not a fan of murder, I thought it was very considerate that Sweeney is doing this for the love and a big piece of his life taken from him for being wrongfully accused. The supporting cast is very nuanced as each actor young or old adds great depth to their respected roles. I knew going into the theaters this movie would be something special, but 'Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street' went beyond what I expected of it. There was plenty of dark humor, lots of emotion by the characters, easy-flowing songs and every performance was a sight for sore eyes and ringing ears. If you're looking for an original movie with great depth, look no further. This movie has everything you need to keep you satisfied.",9,4,6,3 March 2009
Malcolm X," There Are Issues Here That I Don't Buy
","Directed by Spike Lee, this over-budgeted very lengthy biopic, 'Malcolm X' tells most of every facet of his life as he begins as a gangster to becoming a Muslim convert, to becoming an outspoken African- American who wanted to believe that his fellow people should never be afraid to stand up to themselves and to be happy with the skin they have. In the early scenes we see Malcolm X (Denzel Washington) starting out as a criminal under his accomplice named West Indian Archie (Delroy Lindo). He starts by robbing houses along with his assistant Shorty (Spike Lee) and joining his for the ride is a hot young blond named Sophia (Kate Vernon) with whom he chooses as a love interest over a much well-behaved African-American girl named Laura (Theresa Randle). Later on, Malcolm ends up incarcerated and opposing the Biblical teachings from Chaplain Gill (Christopher Plummer) and seems more on the side of African-American Muslim convert Baines (Albert Hall). Once he's discharged, he become the top followers of the Nation of Islam under the influence of Elijah Muhammad (Al Freeman Jr.) Malcolm X becomes a charismatic celebrity, which the white press so arbitrarily decided to lash out controversy towards this young radical. As his bravado increased proportionately, the Nation of Islam became very envious about it while the Nation of Islam becomes a part of a scandal involving Elijah's illegitimate children.Malcolm eventually married Dr. Betty Shabazz (Angela Bassett) and raise three wonderful daughters. He then makes a religious journey to Mecca and declares that not all Caucasians are not entirely evil. When he returns to America, he breaks ties with the Nation of Islam and establishes a rival church that fits the modern spirit at the time. The Nation of Islam did not take this very well and at the Audubon Hotel in Manhattan on February 21, 1965, Malcolm X was beginning a speech when a disturbance takes shape, Malcolm tries to calm everybody down and was gunned down (one of the shooters was his former friend Baines). The movie itself was very high in terms of budget in spite of the very gargantuan production costs. Denzel was nominated at the Oscars for Best Actor in a leading role, but sadly was ousted by Al Pacino for his role in 'Scent of a Woman.' Washington had to wait several years before winning the Leading Actor Oscar in the film 'Training Day.' The film itself was quite accurate in the time period clothes making it very authentic and the lingo spoken by the characters was very appropriate during the time period. The costume design was also in Oscar contention as well. The other high point was that many scenes were very well filmed, especially the uproar during Malcolm X's assassination.Sure it was praised by many including myself, there are still quite a few issues that didn't sit very well with me. Some of these were small nit-pickings while others were much more bigger that truly hindered the film from being anything but perfect. Where to start was the singing performance by Miki Howard, who was supposed to play the part of Billie Holiday, but her voice doesn't even come close to even sounding like her. Anybody who listens to jazz and Big Band music know Holiday's familiar voice. It wouldn't have hurt if she just lip-synched from a Holiday soundtrack and it would have been more convincing. Lee really should have known better. The more obvious falsifications come from the character Sophia. She's hanging out at an all black girls nightclub and just freely throws herself in Malcolm's arms with no indication as to he is. I'm sorry but that is very illogical. It's just a scene designed to get male viewers' attention. It would never happen to you even if you have Washington's looks.It seems strange that the Nation of Islam has a hostile attitude to Washington who at the time looked decent, well-caring family man who loved his wife and kids. Did he munch on pork rinds at the time? Who knows?Another unanswered question stems from the scene where he stands up the cops after they unmercifully beat the tar out of a black man. Malcolm brings in a group of identically dressed black men to await for his command. Where did he find them and how did they fall into his lead? And what's the purpose of them acting like soldiers? To me they're there to look cool behind the camera if nothing else. And finally I must wonder what does Malcolm X himself truly stand for? He transforms from a thief in his early years, to a radical Islamic radical and finally reconsiders his thoughts long enough and before you know it he's murdered. Sure his mission was to for equality, but his execution was more radical rather than peaceful. He was separated from most of his life and wanted his fellow people not to anticipate with anything the white majority did and joined a church who eventually turned against him by having him killed. These quibbles are what brought this movie down. I think some editing should have been greatly desired as this movie went on too long and many scenes needed further explanation. But other than that, the performances were excellent an Washington acted his heart here as the the other performers. But the illogical scenarios brought this film down from being an absolute masterpiece.",6,9,21,8 March 2015
Taxi Driver," A Classic Film from the 1970's
","Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) has become one of the most iconic characters in the movies during the 1970's. Even after three and a half decades, people of all ages get jittery even after watching and just can't get enough of the brilliant performances by the cast and the dynamic directing job of Martin Scorsese. What makes this film really special is that it defines antiheroes that are not intended to likable but intimidated. But at the same time you just get entranced by the charisma of De Niro's performance you have no other alternative but to admire this psychologically scarred Vietnam vet Travis Bickle. Bickle is a decorated war veteran who finds himself working as a New York City taxi driver as a way to make money and to keep in touch with the outside world. Bickle is a social outcast, even though customers are just a seat him he's still alienated from them. His self-alienation comes to the point that even looking through the mirror, he can't even identify his own reflection. But this is because that's the way he chooses to be because the rage inside of him manifests within him as the inner scars from Vietnam are still with him and may linger with him till the day he dies. He finds the love of two women that are woefully mismatched with this walking time-bomb. One of the women is named Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) who's a campaign manager geared to elect a new President. She out of better judgement voluntarily obliges to go out with him, but surely regretted it when he took her to see an X-rated movie. But Bickle was not seeing the raunchy movie because he's a pervert, but because he's trying to rectify his humanity that's been absent from his war days. The other girl he's smitten for is the preteen hooker named Iris (Jodie Foster) as he defines sex as a symbolic synonym for inner rage as he defends her against her pimp (Harvey Keitel). He believes she's crying for his help, when in reality, she's chosen this life for herself. As the days go by, Bickle's inner rage takes its turn for the worst as he decides to eject himself from getting in touch with reality and has decided to bring some people down. One of the first targets is the Presidential hopeful that Betsy is campaigning for. When that didn't work out like he anticipated, he decides to go after Iris' pimp daddy. After the carnage is done, we can see the power of what De Niro, Scorsese, Paul Schrader and even Mr. Bickle himself is getting at. De Niro gives a whole new and original concept of sexual aggression as being both grotesque but understand through the eyes of Bickle. He wants to take that aggression to other people, when in fact, the only person he's appalled with is himself. He has an unintentional misunderstanding of what love is all about. He wants to make people's life a living hell, but can't control the inner demons so he takes them down with him. And it's all explained by the famous talking to himself in the mirror. To him, he thinks he's pointing a gun at someone, but in reality he's unconsciously pointing a gun at his reflection.Martin Scorsese was at the top of his game in the 1970's as 'Taxi Driver' was the film that made Scorsese a household name. The opening shot kind of reminds me of the opening for the 1977 equally successful film 'Star Wars' with the big yellow cab moving off-left. The inner demons depicted in 'Taxi Driver' can stem from two possibilities. It could be from loneliness, alienation or just a way to prove you're right when the whole world thinks you're not. That may explain why Bickle decided to break ties with humanity.",Null,0,0,6 September 2011
Ocean's Thirteen," Who Say The Number 13 Has to be Bad
","After many disappointing threequels, this one does represent that 'Ocean's Thirteen' third entry to the series is a charm. It great to see Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his posse back in the action for another robbery, only this time it's much more personal over casual. Al Pacino stars as Willy Bank, a powerful Las Vegas casino owner who partners up with Reuben Tishkoff (Elliott Gould)to build a new new casino, but heads start to turn as Bank betrays Tishkoff and throws him of the partnership leaving him with absolutely nothing. After a series of verbal squabbling, Bank tells Tishkoff to 'go screw yourself.' This leads Mr. Ocean and his gang to bring down Bank for what he did in what is to be the ultimate heist for Ocean and the gang. Members of the gang including Basher (Don Chedle) and the Malloy Brothers (Casey Affleck and Scott Caan) would rather have Bank's head on a silver platter. But that would be too easy for Ocean's gang and not much fun either. Instead they've plotted to get back at Bank and his Casino by toiling with the games so that one one wins in his casino and eventually will leave Bank bankrupt (no pun intended). Though the plan looks fun and easy, there is a slight burden to this diabolical plan. A security device called 'The Greco' can spot gamblers if they're rigging the casino. This device can track a person's heartbeat or other quirky affliction to determine whether the gambling is done legally or illegally. So seemingly impossible to take down, the Greco, Ocean needs plenty of resources and hordes of cash in order to achieve this impossible mission to take down this security device. Fellow Ocean member Linus Caldwell (Matt Domon), suggests to Ocean to ask an old nemesis from the past, Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) to put their differences in the past and to back them up financially.This is a pivotal and remarkable addition to the series that every fan of the series will get a kick out of. People were very upset about the previous outing 'Ocean's Twelve' mainly because it wasn't intended to a sequel to it's predecessor 'Ocean's Eleven'. Here it revitalizes what made the 'Ocean Eleven' a classic. Twelve is an even balance between Eleven and Thirteen, with 'Ocean's Thirteen' being by far the best of the series. It certainly interesting that director Steven Soderbergh has created a movie where we're able to sympathize with con artists, making casino bosses, as evil villains with their mind set on power and corruption. Another reason why this addition stands out is the performance of Al Pacino. When was this guy ever in a bad movie? His character depths have always stood the test of time and in 'Ocean's Thirteen' it's no exception. Chalk up another great portrayal for Pacino who if it were another actor, the role of Willy Bank would've been clichéd, but Pacino made sure that wasn't the case. Whether he's playing good guys or evil-doers you can always depend on Al Pacino to make every movie he's in all the more riveting.",8,2,3,23 February 2009
Full Metal Jacket," A More Facinating Look At The Vietnam War In Terms of Training and Action
","Even though most of the cast are not really household names, there is one major star featured here, the direction from the legendary Stanley Kubrick. After being off the spotlight for several years, Kubrick sought inspiration from Coppola, Cimino and Stone and give his perspective on the deadliest wars in the 20th century. In reality, 'Full Metal Jacket' has a more fabricated perspective of the Vietnam War to date. The scriptwriters for this movie were novelists Gustav Hasford and Michael Herr based off of Hasford's novella 'The Short Timers' while Kubrick had to depend on archives like videos and books in preparation for his project. It may be heavily borrowed, but the take on the Vietnam War is quite original.The locations to where this movie was being filmed was actually in Britain at the famous Pinewood Studios. Kubrick did everything to make his movie feel American and look American, but his creation is as Britain as fish n chips. The scene of the actual Vietnam War is situated near an abandoned gas-works area around the Thames. The training camp that's set in South Carolina is really filmed at England's Bassingbourn's military barracks. Though this film may lack in historical accuracy, the set pieces and the artistic merit is very provocative. Aside from the self-built war zone, Kubrick added layers of sounds and effects to make the scenery more effective in its storytelling. When it comes to set-building Kubrick is his own Frankenstein.The story centres on Marine Pvt. Joker (Matthew Modine) is sent to Parris Island where his under severe training from the no-nonsense Gunnery Sgt. Hartman (R. Lee Ermey in an Oscar-nominated performance) transforms these boys into stone cold killers. The second half takes them out of the training camp and into centre of the action where he now becomes a journalist for Stars and Stripes that prides itself on boosting morale while reporting news in relation to the war. From there Joker befriends Pvt. Rafterman (Kevyn Major-Howard) where they assign themselves to meet with the deadly military group in Vietnam, the Tet Offensive.Always the punster, Joker can succeed in keeping his character in tact while the other Marines have to kiss the dirt and eat it afterwards. Joker can still deliver dark humour even in the face of danger and succeeds in doing John Wayne impersonations as well. But still his icy morals are put to the test and learns that he can't escape from his situations or discover that life's not always a joke and that danger can laugh back at you which he discovers in a final climax.The film is divided into two principals acts. The first is where Joker and other recruits are under intense training from a tyrannical Gunnery Sgt. Hartman. One notable recruit is a rotund simpleton named Leonard Lawrence (Vincent D'Onofrio) whom Hartman refers to as Gomer Pyle. Hartman takes a likeness in verbally belittling Pyle daring him to strike at him though Pyle resists. While Pyle' s struggling, Joker is assigned to tutor him so he can be more better at following protocol and becoming less of a bumbling idiot. We discover Pyle has a knack of shooting firearms with exact precision and that Pyle is not stupid, but actually psychotic. The term 'full metal jacket' derives from the bullet casings he possesses and discusses that before he meets his ugly demise.The second act takes place at the battle field where Joker is joined by camp mates Eightball, Cowboy, Lt. Touchdown and an equally unstable Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin) who's willing to kill anyone who's eyes are slanted. Like Pyle he also kind of has a rotund figure and also has equal levels of insanity like Pyle. Once his insanity is in full swing, Joker must confront Animal Mother much the same as he did with Pyle.Sure the story is met with simplicity and purpose, it still very dreamlike and fatal in its quality. Many of the characters are fleshed out really well while others are just set pieces put together like board game ready to strike. The finale has a cat-and-mouse feeling as the Marines give chase to a sniper set in an eternally flaming building that has the feeling lie a satanic temple. The soundtrack is rather interesting in one cheeky humour moments as the men are lacing the boots while Nancy Sinatra's 'These Boots are Made for Walking' can be heard. the constant fire crackles of burning buildings can be heard while a prolonged bass line is very effective in these scenes. Rather than depending on historical accuracy, Kubrick depends on more technical features that are effective and not overkill.",9,0,1,6 November 2018
Corpse Bride," Great Film For the Halloween Season
","Make no bones about it, 'Corpse Bride' is a classic stop-animation classic that will appease to both kids and adults alike. The technicalities are at its finest and the film has the right amount of ghouls and goth that has been a symbolic trait for director Tim Burton. And sure Burton does have an abundance of creative contributions to the movie, 'Corpse Bride' was mostly given the directorial duties to animation director Mike Johnson. The age demographic for this movie will likely be for the twenty-something goths who set the mood for themselves as they await the young kiddies as they approach your doorstep as they trick-or-teat for candy.Although the animation is crisp and the voice performances are spectacular, it's hard to pinpoint if they're principal target is towards kids and young adults. The settings emanate in an unorthodox surreal eternally dark atmosphere where it's foggy most of the day and the bright moonlight comes out at night. Our leading protagonist is a young man named Victor Van Dort (Johnny Depp) an introvert who lives with his overbearing rich parents Nell and William (Tracey Ullman and Paul Whitehouse). They had arranged for Victor to marry a charming young lady named Victoria Everglot (Emily Watson) whose aristocratic parents Maudeline and Finis (Joanna Lumley and Albert Finney) are now penniless.The characters here all seem to have that eerie, pale-faced complexion to give them that look like they've spent their vacations in coffins. It's as though as if even the mortal characters look like corpses themselves before they get embalmed.In spite of their morbid physiques, the main characters are as a whole mortals. Victor seems to be having cold feet about this fixed wedding as he wanders into the forest rehearsing about his wedding vows while he places the wedding ring on a tress branch where one of the twigs resembles a bony skeletal finger. Just like you would expect in a Gothic fable setting, from the Earth down below a corpse bride named Emily (Helena Bonham Carter) materializes complete with a disheveled ragged wedding gown has now become his wife. Victor finds himself in a predicament as to how he he can annul the marriage or if she was the person he was intended to marry all along.Victor and Emily journey their way into the land down under (not Australia) and it appears that the world down below the graves have more life than in the land of mortals. In Burton's warped mind, the afterlife is one big party where the skeletons grooving to some jazz music hotter than the devil's complete with eyeballs eerily shifting going from one socket to another. Emily herself is kind of a character with problems keeping her eyes together. In addition to that, there is a maggot living inside her head and has a striking impersonation of Peter Lorre.Everyone seems inclined to the Danse Macabre Lite score along with some haunting tunes by Danny Elfman that seem to have a creepy backdrop that's more played for laughs. The fun scenes occur between the rich Van Dorts and the poverty stricken Everglots as each clan has suspicions for one another. William as a fishmonger makes good claims that his abode is larger than that of his supposed in-laws and that it;s quite 'chavvy'.There's plenty of scenes to get you into the Halloween spirit with all the jazzy skeletons,rotting flesh, and a severed head that serves drinks. There's a fine balance that this movie possesses between the humour and freights. After the much bright and cheery success of 'Charlie and Chocolate Factory', Burton decided to counteract his next project to something darker and more eerie all with great panache.",8,0,0,15 October 2019
Gone Baby Gone," The Afllecks Strike Up a Great Pairing Here
","Even though prior to 'Gone Baby Gone', Ben Affleck has turned in some impressive performances like 'Hollywoodland' and 'Changing Lanes', still the mass has never fully warmed up him. While fellow comrade Matt Damon has branched out quite nicely in the Bourne series and the Ocean's series amongst other films, Affleck has lagged quite badly in poor films like 'Paycheck' waving the white flag to surrender. Even his relationship with Jennifer Lopez did not further enhance his acting career in fact it hindered him even worse.Affleck decided it was time to give directing a whirl, I mean what could go wrong? In fact he made a smart career choice here. He had successfully adapts Dennis Lahane's novel about child kidnapping to the big screen while not watering down its drab mood and its scrupulous contradictions. This is the forth installment involving a pair of Bostonian private eyes in hot pursuit, this adaptation not only conveys an intriguing story going for it, but the conflicts it has in store will likely have you drawing up conclusions of your own. The tone of the story carefully executed by Affleck and his co- writer Aaron Stockard, through the mind of Investigator Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) growing up in the mean streets of Dorchester where he's lived since childhood. He joins forces with his girlfriend and professional partner Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan), Patrick is quite resourceful at cracking crimes that the cops neglect. When a young toddler named Amanda McCready (Madeline O'Brien) vanished without a trace, Patrick refuses to be involved in a media saturated investigation. But when her concerned aunt and uncle (Amy Madigan and Titus Welliver) begs him to do this investigation, he finally accepts. In the investigation Patrick and Angie link clues that leads to Amanda's inebriated mother Helene (an amazing Amy Ryan) the investigation starts to easily piece together. By an hour into the movie, we are lead to believe that the plot has unfolded, but then something takes a turn in a contrasting direction. Patrick believes that these clues are not all that what they seem to be. So he goes into more deeper investigation. Filmed in the tough and gritty streets and bars of Boston, everything about Boston comes to life here making the authenticity quite sublime. The gratitude for that goes to 'Braveheart' cinematographer John Toll for capturing the landscapes and very unsettling feel of a noir film that's a bow of respect to the one's from the 1950's. And showing that he's not below his brother's legacy, Casey Affleck exhibits that he was perfectly cast to play this pivotal role. Born in the suburban city of Falmouth, Massachusetts Casey's accent was spot-on. Even though he has a boyish visage and quite a disturbing demeanour, his foul-mouth perpetually angry expressions add significance to this ultra violent film and at times it might even surprisingly catch people off guard. And even though Monaghan's performance is not well-structured as Affleck's and her character is not as developed, she still manages to release emotions through those pretty eyes of hers, which was never intended for the script let alone the novel. And sure the motives within the characters are not decipherable, 'Gone Baby Gone' relishes more on asking the viewers not entirely on what is the right thing to do, but more towards if we exactly know what the right thing is.",8,0,1,18 January 2016
The Bourne Ultimatum," An Improvement From the Previous Bourne Movies
","As a fan of the Bourne franchise, I was a bit let down from the previous outing, 'The Bourne Identity'. Having read the novel, I had high expectations going into the theaters that I was in for a treat. But all my hopes became shattered. But 'The Bourne Supremacy', released two years later lived up to its name by being more supreme than its predecessor. This movie itself got me interested in the Bourne series. I soon began to realize that director Paul Greengrass and script writer Tony Gilroy and company collaborated to create a new action hero that will appeal to the younger audience in this generation. Much like, Ian Fleming did for James Bond. From the mind of this unusual hero, we know he's done bad things in his life, but because he has amnesia, he doesn't remember exactly what they were. Set in our modern society where even the good can't be trusted, the Jason Bourne character is the definitive answer towards morality.'The Bourne Ultimatim' is the third addition to the series based on a novel by Robert Ludlum, is where narration is at its zenith. It's positive message and nail-biting scenes will have you captivated in its almost two hour running time. Once again, Matt Damon is back again and seems more at ease than he was in the other two movies still wondering how or who put him in the predicament that he's in now. This time Bourne is in London and a reporter (Paddy Considine) informs him of an organization called Blackbrier, a more menacing organization than Treadstone that's run by an evil CIA agent (David Stratairn), who wants Bourne dead. Also in pursuit of Bourne is a girl named Pam Lundy (Joan Allen) who has faith, that Bourne is not a threat that the CIA assumes he is. And the city-hopping is off in full swing up to his final destination in New York where he fights off his ex-handlers.Though not a thinking-movie like 'The Bourne Supremacy', this movie depends more on action and non-stop chases, for all action fans. And anyone who gets in Bourne's face, will likely get pummeled. Bourne has Blackbeier's henchman after him who seem to expose similar traits as him. But Bourne is more well-versed than them, so that gives him still the upper edge. Very tense scenes on the rooftops of Tangiers to the traffic-laden streets of the Big Apple, the chase reign supreme. In 'Ultimatum', in spite of the surreal settings and chase scenes, a surprising element you don't see often in action films is that in this movie the characters are believable. The bad guys depicted here look the part as bigwig corporate monsters trying to bring down their man. This portrayal gives you all the more to support Jason Bourne. Damon was made to play Bourne, he never stops to pose, or takes his role uber-seriously, but understands his character and tries to go through to him. The supporting cast was excellent, especially the interactions between Stratairn and Allen as the two antagonists from different worlds trying to bring down Bourne. It was nice to see Julia Stiles back as Nicky with more secrets about Bourne. And Scott Glenn is noteworthy in another top official as a CIA director. The direction by Paul Greengrass was exceptional as brings new light to the Bourne chapter. With the help of screenwriter Tony Gilroy, Greengrass was able to adapt something new to the final chapter where Bourne has to accept what he has done and to accept the consequences. The score by John Powell won't appeal to others, but fits in with the scenes. Overall a very riveting action film, that's very believable and exciting to watch and never insults its audience. This movie calls for multiple viewings and a satisfying addition to action movie fans. One not to miss.",9,3,4,2 February 2009
Fargo," A Great Film By The Brothers Coen
",".The Coen Brothers truly outdid themselves with 'Fargo'. Sure they've scored big with other projects like 'Raising Arizona', 'Barton Fink' and Blood Simple', but 'Fargo' is and always will be the film that really stood the test of time as one of the more successful films that the Coen Brothers ever produced. Next to 'Pulp Fiction', 'Fargo' is one of the best modern day noir film with the Coen formula of tragedy mixed with high prolific humour and violence that will make anyone's blood curdle.'Fargo' is one of those obscure movies that has no real negative sayings about it. Based on actual events that occurred in Noth Dakota/Minnesota in 1987, the movie tells the tale about a financially unstable car dealer named Jerry Lundergaard (William H. Macy) as he cooks up a plot to have his wife Jen (Kristin Rudrud) kidnapped. So he hires two thugs (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormere) who are kind of short on brains and seem to mess things up all the time. This leads to the local Sheriff Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) to seek justice on this whole predicament.What makes this film really special compared to other Coen Brothers films is that the script provides a very diabolical dark humour and the dialogue is near perfect thank mainly to the leading performers William H. Macy and the very funny but effective Frances McDormand. The Coens who were from Minneapolis deliberately made the actors utilize these distinct accents and lingo to get the effect of living in the Minnesota, North Dakota area. It may look and sound over the top and maybe annoying at times to some, but believe me that is how the spoke. It is in no way shape or form a cliché.The camera angles truly exhibits artistic integrity like the Coens intend in all their movies and no scene or camera angle is wasted. They even succeed in making more mundane scenes equally engaging to watch. And sure the comedy here is the blackest of all black comedies, there are some lighter elements to it. sort of like what they did in 'Blood Simple' and this was proved very effective.The only thing I have to say is go see the movie and bring a buddy or two or more and have a great time watching it. Don't let the generic title fool as not many scenes are set in Fargo, North Dakota. But just by watching the movie I guarantee too you may want to bring a thermos with a hot beverage because this movie will in more ways than one chill you to the bone.",9,1,2,15 April 2013
Rush," The Best Film of 2013
","'Rush' stars Chris Hemsworth as colourful, charismatic playboy party-animal James Hunt who was also one of the all-time great in the Formula 1 circuit. Contrary to his lifestyle Daniel Bruhl stars as Hunt's rival, Austrian born racer Niki Lauda who is very aloof, arrogant and only cares about winning and nothing more. In fact he believes that happiness is a sign of weakness to his regiment. Though they've butted heads on the other minor Formula circuits, their real conflicts begin in 1976 during the granddaddy of them all, the ever-dangerous Formula 1 race tracks where many championships were won while many lives have been lost. Lauda utilizing his carefully selected cars and strategic acumen manages to win his way at Ferrari. His hopes of joy and confidence comes crashing down when he's ousted by his arch rival James Hunt who shows that his style is equally significant to his substance. With one of the most dangerous spots on the Formula 1 course, Hunt and Lauda will convert to extreme lengths to prove who's the best while not caring of the physical or psychological implications that go into the course.Filled with fast-paced action, high octane thrills, and a compelling story of one of the most bitter rivalries in Formula 1 racing, 'Rush', goes beyond the excitement of the screeching of the tires and competitors striving to the very best, but is also a character driven drama that looks at how the closest of friends can be the bitterest of enemies when competition is in the air and that the motto of 'win big or die trying' couldn't have been more literally said. If you lack knowledge of Formula 1 racing, no worries at all, the emotions of the characters and the character development between Hunt and Lauda will surely make you choose a side as to who wish will win in this most dangerous sport in the world and Hemsworth and Bruhl do an excellent job at conveying the conflicting rivalry between these two highly competitive racers.Under the direction of Ron Howard, he ensures his audience that will likely see the two leading rivals show both admiration for the athleticism and at the same time exhibit an obvious disdain for their ways of life. We both applaud and at the same time don't envy their career professions. Their lease of life consists of enjoying life like everyday could end unexpectedly and the other to achieve their goal to represent why they compete in this level to begin with.Under the wonderful script by Peter Morgan, we can get further invesed into the rivalry between Hunt and Lauda better and that the polar opposites between the two never looked better. We can easily be more invested into Hunt's character and Hemsworth as his partying ways matches his daredevil high adrenaline energy he brings to these race courses. His reckless style of driving is the perfect married couple to his wild lifestyle of partying, sex, drugs and everything in between. Underneath him we see a flawed man who fears life which contributes to his boisterous lifestyle. Olivia Wilde is wonderful in the role as his first wife Suzy Miller who uses Hunt as a stepping stone to eventually become engaged to Hollywood legend Richard Burton.Bruhl is perfectly cast as the no-nonsense racer Niki Lauda who's social interactions are virtually non-existent and carries this conflicted burden over his shoulders the whole time through. Not only does he look and act like the determined driver, he also plays off the obsessive compulsiveness his character goes through like choosing the right car that will win him championships even down to the weight and aerodynamics of the cars while he at the same time possesses a misanthropic way in life he sees the human and doesn't care what they think of him. The scene where he opens up to his first wife Marlene (Alexandra Maria Lara) we get to know that he's not a complete anti-socialite. The joyride in Italy is quite heart-pulsating. Lauda believes that happiness is his liability as he explains to Marlene that there is no happiness that comes in the career choice he made.The racing scene provide some the most in-your-face action you'll ever witness. It's like we're literally in the driver's seats that feels like a roller coaster ride as the wheels race through the tracks going way over the speed limit. The climax in the movie takes place at the Nurbrugring circuit in Germany which the racers from the past refer to as 'The Green Hell' in which wet conditions on this track can deadly and rivalries within players can be a matter of winning big or dying trying. This track will determine who will compete in the World Championship in Japan. We ask ourselves is it worth it winning the grandest prize knowing that weather conditions are bad and that racers can get hurt or even killed just for the top prize? You bet it does! You think after all this time getting here you're going to to throw it away? I don't think so! Howard wisely observes the psyche between Hunt and Lauda as to see what's going through their minds as each are contemplating the consequences they will face in this challenge.This movie is truly and exciting and dramatic film that was sadly snubbed at the Oscars even though other awards shows gave praise to this movie. The competitive nature between James Hunt and Niki Lauda is brought to life which is more like a stepping stone to their winning ways as the more disdain they have for each the more successful they've become in Formula racing. With a fine blend of exciting races we have a movie that's high in drama, humour, romance and the poetic rivalry between polar opposites is the meal ticket to a gem of a film.",10,2,3,9 February 2020
Burn After Reading," Goes Beyond a Screwball Comedy
","Sure 'Burn After Reading' is a zany screwball comedy written and directed by the Coen Brothers but it goes way beyond the screwball elements of the genre. The casting was well thought of, the plot is surreal and spontaneous and everyone feels at home here. I was especially impressed with Brad Pitt as a thick-haired, gum smacking fitness guru, Chad Feldheimer. I thought he was a great actor, but here he cranks it up a notch and just lights up every time he's on screen. It's a role that's really out of this world.What I mean by that is that George Clooney and Frances McDormand who are seeking for a relationship in the wrong areas. McDormand plays Linda Litzke, a co-worker with Chad who thing she will find her Mr. Right on the Web even though her physique may not attract a lot, but give her credit for trying. She then turns her attention over to a plastic surgeon and does some incredible work to all various body parts to make her feel good about herself.George Clooney stars as philandering U.S. Marshal Harry Pfarrer. Harry also seems to be addicted to dating sites and will date anyone that smiles back at him. Harry and Linda introduce themselves and seem very comfortable with each other that is until Linda and Chad find a secretive disc that hold personal information to an Osborne Cox (John Malkovich) a CIA officer who was fired for being inebriated on the job. Cox is married to child doctor named Katie (Tilda Swinton) who's been promiscuous with Harry. And well the plot will likely thicken.No apologies about it, the plot meanders here, there and everywhere. And sure it wraps up quite nicely, it's not the real reason why this film is incredible. The characters and the dialogue sells by itself. Linda and Chad are great together as they take this top secretive disc to the Russian Embassy which could give them a nice cash reward so that Linda. This leads to the boys and girls over at Langley, Virginia to take charge. The dedicated CIA officer (David Rasche) takes his case to his superior (JK Simmons). The boss has little dialogue, but can deliver a witty punchline.John Malkovich strikes a chord every time he graces the screen as the ex-CIA official Osborne Cox he's an inebriate who denies himself on those accusations because he remains punctual in a compulsive manner. He's condescending, cue-balled, hates people and impressed how he caught those two plebeians at the gym. Clooney can show he can transform his characters making them very versatile in everything that he does. One minute he's serious and focused, then after a wink of an eye, he can be a moody imbecile. You never what Clooney has in store for us. This marks the third and final line of doofus Clooney comedies that the Coen Brothers starred him in after 'Oh, Brother Where Art Thou?' and 'Intolerable Cruelty'. All the while as much as he can play serious and focused characters it's great that Clooney can take the time to lampoon himself every now and then.Frances McDormand is very fun to watch here as a determined individual with a small fragment of her state trooper character from the 1996 cult classic 'Fargo' lurking around her character here. She has a great deal of innocent intentions about her, but her mission to take this top secret information to the Russian Embassy is her mission and will stop at nothing to achieve her goal. In every role she stars in she just seems naturally fit and comfortable and it organically works out in the end.In the end 'Burn After Reading' is clearly not the greatest Coen Brothers film nor will it make you go into any kind of deep thinking. It's still a funny film, energetic with great levels of sadness which is believable since knowing that the characters we have to endure with in the next 95 minutes are not the most sanely bunch. I'm not complaining that the film was too long. In fact it's quite reasonable. My gripe is that the ending was way too free and ended quite abruptly. There are several questions left unanswered as many issues remain uncovered.",9,2,3,21 August 2018
Watchmen," The Effort Was Flawless, But the Final Product Was A Letdown
","The Alan Moore graphic 1987 novel 'The Watchmen' ranks as an icon as it took the comic book genre to leap over hurdles by making it into a literary masterpiece. Almost a year ago, I went to see the movie with high expectations that this was going to live up to Moore's novel. The sad truth it turned out to be less than what I have expected. It's not that it was so bad I demanded my refund, it just didn't live up to the novel, even though a lot of heart was put into it. In a nutshell, the stuff I liked about the movie is that it carefully recreates nearly 90% of the novel, even to the smallest details. Sure that also includes having the honour's of observing Dr. Manhattan's (Billy Crudup)private parts, but more importantly they nailed at the illustrations to near perfection. The visuals and the sound effects were some of the best I've seen in a long time. The narrative of Dr. Manhattan was surprisingly interesting and witty. The action in the movie is enough to raise a few eyebrows and the action from the movie is accurate in a sense as it's taken from the book and was executed perfectly.The material that needed improvement was that it times it falls in the category of being to shallow at times. For example in the novel, the threat of Nuclear War is in effect, yet the frightening intensity and fear is featured in the novel, but in the movie the intensity is not there. The civilians in the novel are in mass-panic and the paranoia that's manifesting in the lives of these people give it's readers the same intensity as well. But in the movie, it doesn't happen. The only characters that are scared are the superheroes and the government officials. This results in a lack-luster effort by the production because a big chunk of the plot from the novel is missing almost to the brink of being pointless. With this deadly war coming soon to a city near you, you can't just depend on an all-tiring scene where the President sits on their asses in a war room to give an emergency address across the nation. With the war on hand they're fighting to stay alive and being able to see it ourselves, we never get to feel for the civilians because we're focusing more on the war room and less on the fight. The acting was in the most of it pretty droll because the intensity and the emotions in the character are very underused. The one who stood above average was the Jackie Earl Haley's character of Rorschach who was very convincing, but the characters overall don't stand out like they did in Iron Man. The portrayal of Richard Nixon is badly caricatured and the soundtrack is just as equally degrading. Who thought it would be funny to include the 'hallelujah' song during the sex scene? Whatever! Silly to put goofy songs during tense moments is enough to make anyone cringe. Even the funeral scenes are looked as a joke, what gives? No respect for the dead?Okay it's impossible to take every detail in the book and cram in all the scenes, that I understand. Sure it was very good physically and stylistically, but I was a bit disappointed with the finished product. To those who admire the work of Alan Moore it's worthy of at least one watch, but there would not be a need to see it more than that. It's a good action movie, but not counting for other tastes. The movie has missed a lot and after we're finished watching the movie we might be able to know what was missing from the novel.",6,0,2,11 January 2010
Hot Rod," Bad Story, But Enjoyable Fun
","Many people at the time of the making of this movie 'Hot Rod' have asked themselves, is Andy Samberg ready to enter the film industry after only a one year stint on the iconic sketch comedy, 'Saturday Night Live'? Veteran alums like Adam Sandler and Will Ferrell took them many years to develop their acting chops in comedy before advancing through in their careers as movie stars. Now all of the sudden, this young man who's just wrapped up his second year on SNL has left the set and is now making his debut on the big screen. It felt as if Samberg was rushing his movie career too fast by not taking his time gain experience like Sandler and Ferrell did, and even I asked myself why? The only reason I could come up with was at the time SNL's roster didn't seem primed up for movie stardom yet. Samberg was the only true star at the time who seemed eligible for stardom. The movie 'Hot Rod' was a pivotal step in the right direction, but Samberg is still eons away from the success Sandler and Ferrell has had with their movies.Samberg stars as Rod Kimble, who has ambitions to become a famed stuntman because his late father was fellow stuntman who once worked for the legendary Evel Knievel. He doesn't have any kind of major goal in life, but the one thing he wants more than anything in the world is get the respect from his father Frank Powell (Ian McShane) who has verbally and taunted Rod ever since he's been in his family's life. Even though he tries his hardest and has had his share of bumps, bruises and broken bones, he still an awful stuntman and no one seems to take him seriously. However his half-brother Kevin (Jorma Taccone) and his dim-witted friends Rico and Dave (Danny McBride and Bill Hader) along with his love interest Denise (Isla Fischer) seem to support him all the way. When he comes home his mother, Maries (Sissy Spacek) informs him that Frank is now diagnosed with severe heart conditions and that he needs a substantial amount of money for much needed surgery or else he'll die. Rod decides to sacrifice his life and limb to raise the required money by attempting the impossible stunt by stunt biking over 15 school buses. If he and Frank pull through this he has fulfilled his destiny and finally get to kick Frank's behind.If you think 'Hot Rod' is a standard comedy, you may as well say Hitler was just a serial killer. You're told that because everyone else says so, but after seeing this movie you'll know better that it's all not true. You will be manipulated to laugh for the sole purpose that everyone around you is laughing. sure the opening scenes are very hilarious with the faux 'Jackass' promo, the spoof of the 1980's film 'Footloose' and his falling down cliff are vintage laugh out loud moments. And then by the second half, it just starts to get weird. It's not everyday you see a man costumed as a grilled cheese sandwich combating against a man dressed as a taco. I mean this racial joke goes beyond surreal by adding blood for good measure (or was just taco sauce). Samberg and his fellow cohorts manage to take simple slogans like 'Cool beans' and turn it into a You Tube infused rap will surely make everyone laugh, while you wonder how this scene made it into the final cut.Aside from the continual brain farts and the weed smoking flashbacks, the main flaw towards 'Hot Rod' was that even though it sacrifices itself in its outrageous humor giving this film more guts than brains, the main setback was the emphasis on Rod's hobby as if nothing else really matters. The funniest thing about 'Hot Rod' isn't how Rod keeps falling flat on his face through every stunt attempt, but it's the interaction between he and his eternally cranky step-father. And the finale at the end leads to the climactic showdown between Rod and the now fully recovered Frank. One memorable scene that had me laughing was when Frank pulled out a ninja star and threw it at Rod. It was truly one of the best scenes ever witnessed in a film for a very long time. And while 'Hot Rod' is a very good, movie it's far from being perfect. For starters Isla Fischer who seems quite capable as a comedic actress, she has very little to work with. And while Pam Brady who wrote the script for 'South Park: Bigger Louder and Uncut' really didn't need any assistance from Samberg and company. But by the end of the 'Hot Rod' is a pivotal milestone for Andy Samberg, and the future looks good, still 'Hot Rod' is far from great, but it gives the true test of time that a bad movie can still be enjoyable.",7,0,1,27 January 2015
Justice League," One to Make You Proud To Be A Superhero Comic Book Fan
","When inhabitants on Earth want to violate their stay by creating chaos all around them, it's up to superheroes in all walks of life that are there to stop them and they make films like these their own. Under the direction of Zack Snyder 'Justice League' features all of our beloved characters from the DC Universe in an epic showdown between good and evil.From the early stages it comes unsurprisingly that this is an origin story of creating a league of iconic superheroes like Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman who have always been favourites among the DC Universe in both live-action and animated films but it was refreshing to add in three familiar characters from DC's past and join forces who have yet to shine in live-in solo projects on their own (though Aquaman successfully did in 2018). What was remarkable was that they formed this alliance right away and got right into the story without wasting a moment of your time.After the horrific death of Superman (Henry Cavill), Batman (Ben Affleck) decides that since he can't handle this mission on his own, he gathers up other superheroes in a epic battle to save humanity from an impending invasion. Erza Miller joins the troop as Barry Allen better known as The Flash who's both energetic, determined and insecure. Jason Momoa brings life into Arthur Curry/Aquaman who's both physically strong but very head-strong too. And Ray Fisher shines as Victor Stone/ Cyborg who brings his heart to the game though tries to find purpose behind is all very understanding.We're glad to see Gal Gadot back as Diana Prince/ Wonder Woman who is still grieving and questioning herself in saving humanity while mourning the death of Steve Trevor. At the same time we understand Batman's situation as he's showing his age and that his composure is waning as he's aware that he will retire very shortly.Though the superheroes are fleshed out nicely, it's a shame that the villain doesn't get the same treatment. Steppenwolf (Ciaran Hinds) is just another underdeveloped villain from the planet Apokolips who sends his Parademons on Earth to search for three Mother Boxes with no real scenes from him that one could describe as memorable. Marvel Studios are famous for unmemorable villains too.While clocking in at the two hour mark, it shows that the narrative is way too simplified. I understand that some people think two and half hours might be labouring, but by rushing into the action and gathering these superheroes we get little to saviour the moments and get to know why they're chosen into this deadly mission. There are also tedious moments where events are just patched on just to create an incoherent series of events which makes the flow of the story underwhelming.And sure we comic book hero fans understand that underneath the their costumes and traits they bring to the fight are impressive, we also know that they are all humans underneath. In the graveyard scene conversation between Cyborg and Flash, we see the effort to make them more human, but it still looked more cheapened than fleshed out.In the end, 'Justice League' is remarkable film that features all the classic heroes from the DC Universe with plenty of exciting action, with likable characters and potential to have future installments in the future. It brings a great feeling of joy like being a kid again.",7,8,12,1 October 2019
21," Flawed But Entertaining Sin City Themed Movie
","As a fan of movies based off of high stakes gambling and the manipulative way of how Hollywood has glamourized Vegas to death, I do come to the realization that Sin City id not as glittery as they make you all believe. Sure it may be biased in my point of view because I'm not a gambler but I was never turned-on by the seductive nature this city unapologetic exposes to us making it feel as if it's a giant amusement park for adults. No matter how much profit you make the results are always the same, the house emerges victorious. Aside from the casinos many hotels surround them and guess where they get their revenue from? Need I say more?Inspired by real events based off of a novel by Ben Mezrich, '21' centres around six MIT students who esoterically use their cunning wit that no textbook was offered to them to come up with their own codes and rhythms to win it big on the Vegas strip. As usual, Hollywood successfully sexes up the scenery combined with Kevin Spacey taking charge as Prof. Mickey Rosa and the students are donned in their trendy night outfits. Although they are super smart, the students are persuaded by Mickey that they deny they are cheating, but rather outsmarting the system by way of card counting. Sure there's a hint of complex mathematics and some methodology to avoid being caught even by means of going incognito, fake names and different gestures, words and body language.What gets me annoyed here is that the filmmakers try to dumb us down by providing us every detail stating the obvious that through every casino codes change, and that no trick is ever repeated twice. It makes it that way so that the subplot featured here leaves a bad impression that their manipulative influences are out-shined and downplayed by technology the threat of head security officials like Cole Williams (Laurence Fishburne) in an unimportant job.After the success of the 2006 film 'Across the Universe', Jim Sturgess seems to be increasing his credentials to his resume as desperate for money MIT student Ben Campbell who like every academic is trying to enroll at Harvard Medical School is willing to rake in the dough with the limit of $300,000 which is how much it is to get that prized scholarship. So then we have this formulaic theme as Ben becomes so good at the game that all his earning get taken away from him and the lesson that greed will get you nowhere.The other students under Mickey's guidance include Jill Taylor (Kate Bosworth who co-starred with Spacey in 'Superman Returns' and 'Beyond the Sea') Choi (Aaron Yoo), Kianna (Liza Lapira) and Fisher (Jacob Pitts) their mathematical methods are honed by a systematical montage. They go through the tests and regiments and the strategy in how they're going to pull themselves through the tables. While this is proceeding, they have room for some romance, and their obsession for quick cash, intensity is in high gear and the not so glorious lifestyle of being wealthy. As sad as it seems, the supporting cast add very little significance to the story. Bosworth is just on for the cliche love interest and while the two token Asian performers are just stereotypical caricatures like a kleptomaniac.Though Spacey is convincing in another chilling performance and Sturgess handled the naive pretty boy role fittingly, however '21' just has to spoon-feed us putting every piece of development right in front of us and all the essential plot twists are just a motion away and how the mathematical rouse is fully explained. If you think this will be an educational trick to learn from, don't be fooled. There's a myriad of mathematical know-it-all and the methodical practices are more complex than what is given to you. Maybe you'll be luckier on the slot machines.What was great about '21' was that it demonstrated just how crooked the Vegas tables really operate and how getting good grades are not the only requirements in getting a good education and that money and finance are the keys to your goals. And yes tuition is expensive and salaries increase every year, it's believable that students who aren't privileged will go through great lengths just to reach their goals educationally and financially.In the end, '21' succeeds in being an entertaining heist film and keeps itself as serious as it can be. And sure it's colourful like the average Hollywood film normally is, the cheaters never prosper moral message is pasted on the while time through. And that only the smart survive once the dust clears and that earning money is better than winning money.",6,1,1,8 September 2019
North by Northwest," A Grim Tale of Mistaken Identity
","Alfred Hitchcock's 'North by Northwest' stars Cary Grant as Roger Thornhill, an advertising executive for a magazine is socializing with his colleagues at the well-renown Plaza Hotel only to be interrupted when by a pageboy wanting a person by the name of George Kaplan. Thornhill eventually gets abducted by two henchmen named Valerian (Adam Williams) and his associate Licht (Robert Ellenstein). They believe that Roger is George Kaplan who is believed to be a secret agent who's trying to stop them from smuggling microfilm which holds to key to various government secrets. Trying to hang on to dear life all the while to clear his innocence, Thornhill goes on an all-over America quest to find the real George Kaplan who's much more harder to find than he could imagine. He eventually gets seduced by a voluptuous diva named Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) as he tries to get away at the cost of being betrayed. It turns out that Miss Kendall is a double agent and Thornhill is an oblivious bystander. A dangerous chase comes his way which takes Thornhill across Mount Rushmore across the visages of the four iconic presidents. Even though Alfred Hitchcock directed this masterful film of thrill seeking espionage, he wasn't the only main reason this film was beyond remarkable. The very intellectual script by Ernest Lehman makes the dialogue just as equally poignant as the action. What is also a major milestone in the world of film-making comes from the opening title sequences by Saul Bass who for the first time used animated text to keep the viewers intrigued. For this movie like in all his movies, sadly Hitchcock was shut out at the Academy Awards for best direction, but had three nominations well deserved which included Best Script by Lehman, Best Editing by George Tomasini and Best Production Design. The trials and tribulation that our protagonist faces can really be hard at the nerves at times. I'm not a huge fan of seeing innocent people being framed for mistaken identity, but 'North by Northwest' really exhibits this type of film almost flawlessly. From the opening scenes where he's picked up by these felons while eating with his colleagues and the more he struggles, the more our anxiety manifests within our psyche. And the fact that there is no George Kaplan, makes us more upsetting because know Thornhill can't even prove that he's not who they think he is. But the courageous thing about it is that Thornhill will not surrender that easily. The leading performances by Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint were absolutely stunning. Grant keeps the anguish going while trying to remain as collected as possible. EMS was able to take some risks by jumping hurdles that were pretty unknown at the time. This duo really carried the cargo of the film provocatively, but it took quite some moments before EMS entered the fray, but once she came into the scenes, the film really took off after. James Mason showed ferocity as the leading antagonist, but it was Martin Landau's Leonard that was even more macabre. His dialogue conveys just how homosexuality was treated during the golden age of cinema. Rounding out the smaller supporting roles is Leo G. Carroll who goes by the name of 'The Professor' who concocted this whole Kaplan fiasco, but the more endearing moments are when Thornhill is interacting with his mother, Clara (Jessie Royce Landis who was just seven years older than him). The visuals were really out of this world. such memorable scenes includes the dazzling intoxicating car chase scene to the humorous elevator scene to the auction house scene and the climactic chase across Mount Rushmore.But the real eye-opener is when Thronhill is being chased by a crop duster, the shooting was some of the best ever delivered. For aficionados of the visual arts will truly enjoy this stylistic film. 'North By Northwest' was vintage Hitchcock. The thrills will shock you, frustrate you all the while make your head spin in amazement. It comes with the man on the run, the double-crossing diva and the shady villain. It a vital movie for all Hitchcock impresarios and he would follow up with the even more eerie classic a year later with the iconic 'Psycho.'",9,2,5,6 April 2015
Coriolanus," Shakespeare Film We Can All UnderStand
","Ralph Fiennes can fall into similar pool of talented performers who can also have a knack at direction just like Robert Redford, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood. In his directorial debut, 'Coriolanus' Fiennes combines a Shakespeare film that anyone can grasp at. Even if you don't have a degree in Shakespearean literature. In his 30 year career, Fiennes has built an impressive reputation of really getting emotionally deep into his characterizations and going out of way to make the complexities of his characters something to get his audience a reason to root for. His direction has similar traits to his performances. The film explores the strengths and vulnerabilities of his character along with the many triumphs and failures while keeping his characters look and feel real.Fiennes stars as Caius Martius Coriolanus, a mighty but questionable general in the Roman army. During a altercation with a rival army brigade, he goes beyond protocol that cause his civil liberties to be in doubt. An activist elite wants Coriolanus evicted for his violations. For his heroic accomplishments, his supportive mother Volumnia (Vanessa Redgrave) suggests he be ranked to the position to the high office of the Consul. But he must get support of from the destitute who were the ones most affected by his questionable deeds. Many people want him to reach out and restore peace which also includes his wife Virgilia (Jessica Chastain). He agrees to get support, but the activists don't want any of that. Feeling rejected from those he stood up for, Coriolanus joins forces with his enemy Tullus Aufidius (Gerard Butler). The consequences come into play once these two form an alliance.I may feel like a complete idiot, but I may as well make confession to all of you. I have always had trouble deciphering Shakespeare. The language and the lingo was all so complex. Even simple tales like 'Romeo and Juliet' are hard to fully translate. On the plus side, 'Coriolanlus' was quite easy to get invested in. Thanks to the script from John Logan his technical skills make it easy to get under without insulting our intelligence. In various scenes, mock TV newscasts appear to gather updates during the coarse of the action. A real added treat is that some of the characters actually speak in more modernized language so that not all Shakespearean literature geniuses will be lost in translation. The actors also contribute to the worthy cause by generating emotions that are effective and their language tones are clear enough so that we can care about the characters while the performers understand that we're not living in the 16th century and our language has altered a bit over the years for better or worse.The ensemble cast is quite remarkable. Fiennes is just genuinely jacked up as the titular character. His rage and intensity sends chills as he plays a man who doesn't act, but demands our respect. If you put this guy down in any way, vengeance will be just a motion away whether you deserved it or not. Fiennes is just powerfully scary. Redgrave is equally ambitious as his mother who is there at all times for her son. In an extended scene, we see Volumnia trying to get some sense into Coriolanus, but her efforts end up becoming ostracized. Butler as Tullus Aufidius is just the perfect foil of an adversary to Coriolanus. There clashes are fierce with neither of them backing down. Jessica Chastain and Brian Cox show get support as Coriolanus' boss and his trusty confidant are brilliant in their respected performances.It must've took a lot of work to adapt a Shakespearean story told in modern times. But Fiennes and Logan manage to accomplish that by finding the theme while modernizing the scenarios for our viewing pleasures. The action scenes are plugged in fantastically to keep us over the edge and supports the plot flawlessly. In our lifetimes, we had very powerful figures and they all shared one thing we all strive for, to earn respect. People have not always made choices to seek our approval without concern of who will face the consequences. We've been victims under leaders who have been barbarians, psychopaths and cynics. The film explore all those surfaces which makes it very symbolic and accurate.Well executed cinematography, perfectly placed editing and very well performed, 'Coriolanus' went beyond my expectations to being a very entertaining film. The intense atmosphere will likely suck you in. It might help that you understand Shakespeare to get the grasp of the story. If you don't understand the old English of Shakespeare, fear not, the Bard's work are still effective while also has the liberal license to offer new approaches to the classic play. This is clearly a great adaptation to a Shakespearean classic.",9,2,4,9 October 2017
U-571," Tense On Action, But Overall Disappointing
","When it comes to the action scenes and the remarkable visuals, 'U-571' is quite good in that area. I wish I could praise more about this movie, but then I would be lying. This movie had potential to be really good. As a fan of undersea war adventures this movie was a major letdown.For a movie to be remarkably good, you can't just depend on action to stand alone, and though this is high on entertainment, the holes in everything else is quite flabbergasting. One of the biggest flaws about 'U-571' is that it lacks in any kind of historical accuracy as facts are disjointed and the execution was banal. Once again the United States glorifies itself as the heroes of the undersea initiative, but the reality was that it was the British that accomplished the bulk of the task. Why does Hollywood try to fabricate the Americans as the only heroes during the 20th century wars and manipulates its audience by concocting false historical diatribe in order to sell ticket and promote patriotism like they really deserved it?I was really letdown by the acting here. Such a terrific cast of characters like Matthew McConaughey, Bill Paxton and Harvey Keitel, I expected at least an emotionally charged film. Instead the acting was pure cardboard, they should have hired mannequins instead of performers to star in this movie.For a submarine water movie, emotions and identifying a character is mandatory, by the end of the movie I couldn't tell who's who because of the lack-luster emotions between the performers.The directing put into this movie is absolutely shameful. The crew has no personality at all, it looks like as though they didn't put much heart into this movie. Where's the quality of this movie? The opening scenes are at a snail's pace and then it just drags on skimming over the important scenes which makes the movie very choppy and hard to get adjusted. I suppose the director just wanted a patriotic movie that will make the American audiences have something to be prideful about, which they did, but at the cost of them feeling naive because of the inaccurate story.The visuals are what really saves the movie. The shots of the submarine were excellent and the explosions were quite enjoying to watch. However, it still never saves itself from the mess this movie possesses.If you compare this movie to Wolfgang Petersen's 'Das Boot', it's like comparing prime rib to puppy chow. It's clear that this movie is a sad waste, and had a lot of material to be really good. But with a lot of misery this story develops I can't score high in this review. The action just keeps coming along, but there's no story to tell with no tell with no lessons learn-ed. With poor historical accuracy, bad acting and abysmal direction, this movie should be seen once and then find something else to regain those near two hours you have lost.",5,5,10,26 October 2009
Wanted," The Definitive Bad Action Flick
","After seeing 'Wanted', you might say to yourself, 'that was one good bad action flick.' All the essential ingredients came into place: the action, the fling, the sex, and all the other cheesy schmaltz you see in every action flick. The saving grace in this movie that made it all worth while, was the heart-pulsing energy. In many ways it has a similar feel to the anime 'Cowboy Bebop' coming to life here with similar characters and familiar situations. The story is pretty much recycled material that you may have seen many times before. However, it scores points on suaveness, crooked politics, and plenty of macho-inflated chaos that will make any sex-crazed teenage boy's eyes pop and the non-stop adrenaline will keep you begging for more. If you like movies of this caliber than the more power to you, and if you don't that's your prerogative. But after watching 'Wanted' you must first ask yourself, was it all worth the while? Well that question depends entirely how see the movie. Me personally I think it has a lot of promise on Blu-Ray high definition. It has that guilty pleasure feel to cure those late-night blues after you've finished a big term paper and looking to blow off some steam. What makes 'Wanted' work is the little tidbits to make a movie worthwhile. The implausible encounters, the seductive nature intended here plus all the heart-pulsing action is one to keep you entertained for the next two hours. The drawbacks in this film is that it looks fun, but the honesty in the excitement is dormant, the logic is obviously absent and the relevance is virtually omitted. The thrills are excited enough and with all the chaos happening here, it won't entirely disappoint. Russian born director Timur Bekmambetov conjured up a pleasing effort and and it shows he has the knack in providing a sense of rhythm. But that gift that he has is still yet to come into good terms of what is a fairly decent flick. If those Hollywood hacks can conjure up a story that's not dependent on cheap thrills or explosions, we may see him one day bag an Oscar in the near future. But for know I guess he'll have to depend on pleasing his audience with pyros ans explosions.The performers gave me the felling they were having a blast(pun intended)and they showed realism in their stoic expressions and not taking too many gregarious risks. The real scene stealer in this movie is the excellent performance by Angelina Jolie as she stands out pretty much on her own here. Her charm and charisma attracts her audience of all ages, genders and all levels of intelligence. Jolie just makes every one of her complex scenes look so easy, even through all the unbelievable predicaments she's encountered. Never once does she make it look campy. Now there's someone you can look up to.",7,0,2,27 July 2009
Apocalypse Now," The Redux Makes It All The More Worthwhile
","'Apocalypse Now' stars Martin Sheen as U.S. intelligence officer Capt. Willard who's assigned to travel to Cambodia during the Vietnam War to terminate the demented Col. Walter E. Kurtz (Marlon Brando). Kurtz is in the midst of attempting unapproved and bloody operations in the deepest jungles lead by local tribesmen and U.S. soldiers. Willard is joined by staff members Chief (Albert Tucker), Chef (Frederic Forrest), Clean (a very young Laurence Fishburne) and Lance (Sam Bottoms). Willard teams up with loopy Lt.Col. Kilgore (Robert Duvall) and his helicopter brigade and some Playboy bunnies for entertainment purposes and a French family stubbornly not wanting to leave the premises. This leads up to an epic battle against the sadistic Kurtz.After finally seeing the redux version of 'Apocalypse Now', I can admit that it exceeded everything the shorter version of this classic film has to offer. The AFI has ranked it as one of the top film in movie history and I have no reason to argue that analogy in any way possible. It was truly an amazing masterpiece film and I am just so greatly honoured to witness one of the greatest films ever made. If anyone was expecting a feel-good movie, well what the hell were you smoking? There's no feel-good elements to this film. This is the threshold to hell. The weak at heart is not invited to this party. I'm not trying to be mean, but if you can't take the brutal grimness of this movie, then it's really not for you to see. There are some comical elements, but not intended for chuckling, but for a much darker tone. Martin Sheen truly delivers as Capt. Willard a hired assassin sent on a dangerous mission to track down and kill one of his own kind named Col. Walter Kurtz (Marlon Brando who was his demented best), who has now gone on the brink of dementia has developed an operation set up the deepest darkest jungles in Cambodia during the Vietnam War. One thing I don't understand is why couldn't the Army just simply sent him home via Section 8? I mean lots of Vietnam vets fell too dementia during these harsh moments. Robert Duvall as a tough, but eccentric Lt. Col. Kilgore who enjoys the aroma of Napalm in the morning. Every scene that Duvall is in he just steals every scene he's in.It was very smart of Sheen to take this role, if anything, by the end of this movie, his character should have been rewarded a Silver Star or a Purple Heart or something. I mean he's aboard in a vulnerable navy boat as he crosses the jungle as he eerily gets closer to Kurtz and his insane demesne and as he draws near, I fear that Willard might be on the brink of the dark side himself. With the conditions they're up against, anyone can go bonkers Kurtz, Willard, Kilgore, anyone. You really can't rest on your laurels and say 'what will be will be.' By expanding the film to an extra 49 minutes, I don't know what the story would be without the French plantation in Cambodia. I think it would be lost in the shuffle that we see these people argue over issues like politics as they exchange brandy and cigars maybe it's a ploy for Willard to have his last chance in preserving his sanity. I had a chance to see it on my outdoor theatre. Just the whirling sounds of the helicopters and the explosions of the bombs sound so close to you that it could almost blow up right into your faces. This film is the perfect war movie with great acting, lots of intense scenes and a film that truly won't insult your intelligence. You're more crazier than Kurtz if you choose to neglect this movie.",10,0,3,14 June 2015
Van Helsing," See The Movie Before You Start Judging It
","I can't understand why people ostracize a movie negatively before it actually premieres? I watched 'Van Helsing' 7 years ago and I was completely awestruck by it. The trailer previews doesn't even come close to the actual movie itself as it only shows the small tidbits of what you'll expect to see. The upper echelons at Universal Studios claimed the by the time trailer came into commission, the special effects was not fully completed. I had my doubts at first about seeing it, but in the end, and when the credits were rolling, I had to give a stand up applause. It was that phenomenal.Sure the naysayers will easily be judgmental as Van Helsing will utilize his impressive arsenal of weapons as he embarks on an eclectic journey against the top villains that once graced the silver screen back in the 1930's and 1940's. From the Wolfman to Frankenstein, to Dracula the battles were extremely engaging and it was fun to see the dynamic monsters try to challenge this clever monster-slaying warrior. Granted, this movie will never win any Oscars, in fact the script is cheesier than a lasagne in an Italian restaurant. But if you like watching the biggest, the baddest, the most macabre bunch of monsters to ever hit the screen in one movie, well look no further.The film is just fun to watch. The setting were sublime, the monsters were very graphical and effective. Sure it looks at times like a Simon Belmont video-game in terms of atmosphere, with Helsing defeating these evil beings. The weapons Van Helsing uses is cool enough to make even James bond green with envy. His fight with the Count was very exciting it will keep you glued to your seat as the action and scenery is what makes this movie special. For those who yearn on artsy movies or like to dissect every anachronism that's featured well, it's never too late to turn away from it. Don't spoil it for others just because you're judgemental. But if you're passive about cheesy scripts, but scintillating entertainment, you don't want to miss 'Van Helsing'. Just sit back and let your mind relax.",Null,8,14,21 November 2011
Dreamgirls," Where A Star is Born In Jennifer Hudson
","When I saw the trailers for 'Dreamgirls', I thought it was going to be special. From reading, reviews I discovered I wasn't the only one with this ecstatic feeling. I was hoping this movie goes beyond the standard-fare, historical period piece. I was a bit disappointed that the story was just mediocre at best and that I have seen more better stories based on the music industry in the Motown era in the 1960's.What saved the movie was the beautiful performance by the lovely 'American Idol' finalist Jennifer Hudson, who melted my heart with her beautiful voice and her incredible talent for acting. A real improvement from that stink-bomb 'Fantasia'. Jennifer does everything in her power to support her character Effie,even if her character at times comes off as unlikable. Whenever she belts out her voice, the most vocal critics stop and take notice as the lures you into her clutches, making you want to get up and give her a standing ovation. Hudson was a surprise at the 2007 Oscars being that she was only in a handful of roles, she went on to win an Oscar for Best Supporting Oscar and rightfully so. Hudson was the meal ticket to this movie. Whenever she was off-screen I waited anxiously when she'll be coming on next. The other performers did a pleasant job too like Jamie Foxx, Eddie Murphy, Beyonce Knowles among others gave it their all. Keith Robinson, who played Effie's (Hudson) composer brother C.C. was noteworthy and comes off as a likable character, though his scenes were brief. The characters in the long run were not well developed overall, and at times they drag the scenes whenever Hudson's not present and also the characters you've seen before in all its clichéd Hollywood glitz. Beyonce looked pretty in all her fashionable trends that fit the piece the film was set in. But it was mostly just window dressing, at least until the end of the movie, which was too little and too late for further development in her character of Deena. The costumes were very out of places at times and didn't always fit the time period the movie was set. Even Jennifer Hudson's costumes were hard to configure at times. The choreography was laughably ridiculous as we see preppy kids dancing like puppets, without any hint of soul in their moves. Jennifer did her work perfectly, but the props and costume department didn't do much to compliment her versatility as a star. I gather she was supposed to be a frumpy singer in an all-girl singing group that pays homage to The Surpemes, The Vandellas and the Marvelettes. Okay, but get her some costumes that fit the era the movie was set in. However, Beyonce's make-up was beautifully done. The story doesn't offer very much. And all the clichés come to life here. The familiar story of rags to riches. Let fame get to their head. Then their fame takes a downward spiral, only to discover they had a good thing coming all this time. Thank you let us continue. Now the music is a different story. I though about 80% of the music is quite catchy. Hudson's song melted my heart like a hot knife through butter, Beyonce's solo song was tremendous, even Eddie Murphy, who's not a singer was quite catchy as a tribute to James Brown in a soulful performance. You must get the DVD. If you don't you don't know what you're missing. At times the camera work can make you dizzy. It's like they're shooting an overlong music video at times. It works for action flicks or comedies, but in 'Dreamgirls', it doesn't work here at all. The lighting was quite pitiful and never quite set the mood of the film. Just a bit of laziness in that area.If you wish to see the movie, see it for two reasons: the terrific performance by Jennifer Hudson and for the groovy nostalgic tunes that pay homage to the Motown era of the 1960's.",7,1,1,16 February 2009
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," One For Judd Apatow Fans
","'The 40-Year-Old Virgin' focuses on the character of Andy Stitzer (Steve Carrell), a middle-aged introvert who never had experienced the world of sex. He works at an electronics shop with co-workers David (Paul Rudd), Jay (Romany Malco) and Cal (Seth Rogen) and their boss Paula (Jane Lynch). Across the street from heir workplace is a store called 'We Sell Your Stuff on Ebay' where the proprietor is a middle-aged woman named Trish (Catherine Keener) who has three children and is also a grandmother who currently is not dating anyone at the moment. Trish becomes attracted to Andy, but suddenly his colleagues soon discover that he is a virgin and this is where all the verbal hassling comes into play. Due to the constant hassling has delayed Andy from ever getting any sexual feelings from Trish.I'm sure we have all seen 40 year olds who just happen to be virgins. Yet the leading gender demographics are predominately female. Due to the gender bent more sexual lust, it's very rare to find a male who's a 40 year old virgin. And yet more women seem to get support from others for their celibate lifestyle than men (particularly from men who have been smitten by these women for decades). As a man of 37 years old, I have not experienced what it'd like to be sexual active. If I had a child, I would recommend he or she to lose it sooner than later because I believe one's sexual experience could lead them to a path of glory.Even though I can relate to the leading character here, I don't have complete praise because I didn't find anything that was out of anything unacceptable, at the same there was also stuff that wasn't very memorable too. The only good advice that I found helpful was as soon as you tie the knot, you must sell your entire comic book collection. The other is once you find yourself in romantic fling with a girl, it's time to throw way all the porn videos.Even though the movie has all the essential elements of a sex comedy, however, there's only really one sex scene. The fowl language is put into good effect here and the sexual references are handled in a mature perspective. I say I recommend this movie if your okay with the language and the sexual references.",7,1,2,17 September 2013
Dunkirk," The Shorter Time Duration Really Pays Off
","The British Empire and their allies are have retreated to Dunkirk Beach in France to hideout from German attacks during The Battle Of France in WWII. While they're hiding out it's up to Prime Minister Winston Churchill to send three strands of carriers via land, sea and air to rescue these soldiers and bring them back to safety.Under the direction and script by Christopher Nolan, 'Dunkirk', based of of actual events sends us back to May of 1940 to WWII in the beaches of Dunkirk where soldiers were stranded and it's up to the military to evacuate them whether by air, land or sea. What makes this movie stand out is the unlike most Nolan films that go beyond the two hour mark, this film has been down-sized at just a bit about the 1-45 minute mark. In the end the old quote of 'less is more' stands true here with a film not heavily dependent on dialogue and the actions scenes that are scarce, because anywhere past the two hour plateau, this movie would've been overkill. In the end who needs a film with overly done dialogue or gratuitous carnage to tell its story? this is a refreshing war film that can tell a story without going overboard just to get a cheap reaction, but instead to show a real depiction of war being that the fear waiting to be rescued could be just as scary as being injured or killed.'Dunkirk' is divided between four groups characters with various locations on this isolated beach. They are all stranded in the same time frame and in the duration of their time they are either rescuing people or they are trying to escape the beach. The film is ensemble based and that there is no individual character taking the centre stage. The narrative will guide the viewers about the details of each mission without ever spoon-feeding us or insulting our intelligence. Sure there are those traditional film watchers who might not decipher the whole scope of the film and might dismiss the film as being both confusing and tedious. For those who love and maybe even those who are not fanatic about war there is plenty to enjoy in terms of drama and thrillers the film was executed professionally by an iconic director.Sure there will be the hardcore warheads who will feel cheated because they wanted to see bloodshed and carnage and brutal fight scenes with guns, grenades and explosions. Well, sorry to trouble you, there will be not much of that. But for those who want to see a real depiction of the war and the characters, it's natural that the characters will offer little in terms of communication. Due to the fears of trust, the horrors they've encountered and restlessness, the beach is not customized for socialization. Stories like these don't need explosions, blood and graphic details to get its message across. Just the narrative of going through the topic of evacuating the stranded off Dunkirk is quite sufficient. By keeping it real and doing the essential research, you can see why it won three Academy Awards.In its duration of 1 hour and 46 minutes long, the dialogue is only about 30 minutes long total and sure enough fans might be bored of that. But what makes up for the scarce dialogue is the isolation and the intensity of survival on this beach. And being that it takes place in WWII, I think we can all get a grip that the fear of when and where the enemies will strike. Thanks to a haunting score by Hans Zimmer, the score generates quite nicely to the fear these characters are enduring. As audience members we know what is to expect from the back stories, but we can still picture in our minds the graphic scenery these soldiers have endured. Therefore, with grandeur music that upstages the dialogue, it makes the narrative all the more efficient in its storytelling.'Dunkirk' is war film that is original in terms that it doesn't depend heavily on graphic bloodshed, frequent gunshots and explosions or heavy dialogue. But the music background and the intense atmosphere, complimented with stunning cinematography, this movie is well suited t be a collector's addition being more of a drama film as opposed to a war film. If you want to really get a better grip of the style of direction Christopher Nolan is noted for than this movie is for you. An award-winning film released at a time when the award season wasn't featured.",9,1,4,15 May 2018
54," Misleading Genre As It Plays Out Like A Comedy
","Set in the late 1970's, Studio 54 is a trendy disco nightclub depicted in director/writer Mark Christopher's '54' which stars comical actor Mike Myers as the club's flamboyant kingpin and real life character Steve Rubell. But the leading star of '54' is Ryan Phillippe as a fictional Jersey boy Shane O'Shea with ambitions to seek employment in that club as he gets his feet wet into the establishment arranging tables as a busboy. Then as he progresses, much to the approval of Rubell, he gets promoted as a waiter and sugar daddy to the club's clientèle. Salma Hayek stars as Anita Randazzo, the club's coat check girl who's eloped to another busboy and roommate of Shane's, Greg Randazzo (Brecklin Mayer). Greg has his sights set on becoming a waiter, but due to his marriage commitments, he is deprived from his ambition, therefore making his dreams are sadly limited.What makes this movie only average at best is that the agonizing struggles of these fictional characters is that it's been rehashed and been done several times before. Critics who have expressed their harsh disdain on '54' compared the plot and the story as the weaker sister to 'Boogie Nights', which was more successful at the box-office. I get the impression that the critics claim that '54 steals most of their main ideas and themes, with only difference is that '54' is tamer than 'Boogie Nights'. While I agree to some extent that this movie isn't anywhere near perfect, and that there have been better disco-themed movies than this one, but what makes this film passable is that it has all the essential ingredients to make for a compelling movie. Unfortunately, the resources were not carefully featured.In the case of Steve Rubell, his climb to success from a steakhouse proprietor to a highly successful club owner gets very meager notability, leaving most of his content in the dark, while the main plot is centered around these stereotypical failures as the struggle to climb the corporate ladder in the nightclub enterprise, which to me lacks any kind of depth to the movie. One of the questions that crossed my mind was how did Rubell emerged from running a steak house to owning club that Princess Grace and Truman Capote visited regularly? That should have been the core of '54'. What about the aftermath of Rubell after his imprisonment due to his club being shut down via tax violations? That's where the importance of the movie should have been. Instead we are forced into watching overdone ego-driven hyper-extended melodrama with bare-chested men in tight shorts in a movie with an abundance of loose ends.The acting as a whole was a snore casserole with a side order of yawn juice. But it's not entirely to be blamed by the actors, but perhaps due to the messy script. The big surprise comes from the performance of Mike Myers, breaking away from his comical roots to play an impressive portrayal as a restrained, but mysterious bar owner (I'm sure the real Rubell was more charismatic, if he was able to persuade Arab princes to his New York establishment). Salma Hayek is fun to watch as a coat-check girl who has aspirations to be a singer and paves the way for Shane into getting used to the customs and surroundings of the nightclub. It was a treat to watch the energetic geriatric Ellen Arbertini Dow get down and boogie as Disco Dotty (though her cussing was not all that necessary, even for an old woman). The scenery of this movie in terms of props and setting leaves much for one's desire.",6,0,0,1 December 2008

","Inspired by actual events, 'Dallas Buyers Club' focuses on the dying years of a Dallas hustler who goes out of his way to face up against the FDA to help AIDS patients get the treatments they need to reduce the suffering after discovering that he himself has this unfortunate disease.Ron Woodroof (1950-1992)(Matthew McConaughey) is a part-time electrician and a part-time rodeo entertainer who lives in Dallas, Texas. One day he gets admitted to the hospital on account of a work incident, Mr. Woodroof's hospital admittance becomes more serious than he has expected. The doctors discover that Woodroof has AIDS. Though he's not an excessive needle pusher or a homosexual, he refuses to believe that he has what he believes to be a 'gay disease'. But the tests he receives confirm that he has AIDS and according to his doctor Dr. Sevard (Denis O'Hare) that he has only one month to live.With life hanging on by a string, Woodroof confiscates the experimental drug AZT as a way to stall the illness from getting worse. And when he finally runs out, he ventures off to Mexico in search for other antidotes. What shocks him is that AZT is a poisonous substance and that if AIDS won't kill him, AZT will, but he finds a concoction that will do the trick. A victim of his own selfish purposes to make a profit, but with the assistance of a transvestite named Rayon (Jared Leto, his clientele begins to expand. The larger his client based, the more homophobic and narrow-minded he becomes.If he thought he could keep this operation running any longer, well reality starts to come into play. It isn't before very long that the FDA would storm on and repossess his antidotes and warns him that he will be arrested on account of trafficking. Therefore, with that in mind Woodroof establishes a subscription-only-conglomerate known in which he calls 'The Dallas Buyers Club' where he's not officially selling drugs, but memberships. Woodroof embodies the AIDS community that these remedies actually works. And even though he's a gay-bashing jerk of an individual, but his cause is actually helping those he truly despises. Meanwhile the FDA whose payroll comes from the major pharmaceuticals, these corporate shrills are unintentionally killing them. Rod decides his destiny is to bring down the FDA and ensure that he's doing it for the sake of a cause.Matthew McConaughey has really outdid himself here, by sacrificing his own physicality to lose a substantial amount of weight to turn away from his usual boy-toy personae making him almost unrecognizable. On a mental note, famous for his lovable romantic characters to play a rather crude, narrow-minded homophobic despot. But still, in spite of his flaws, we still love the man for what he's doing and we love McConaughey because he makes this character believable and truly deserves the accolades that was given to him.Jared Leto also looks unrecognizable under all that makeup and dresses to play Woodroof's assistant Rayon. Leto avoids the silly humour like a he's going to a costume party to play a very sympathetic and endearing character. Jennifer Garner has the more complex initiative as the morally inclined Dr. Eve Saks, but she still manages to pull it off flawlessly. The supporting players are equally poignant with Denis O'Hare as the corporate siding physician Dr. Sevard and Steve Zahn as Woodroof's cop buddy, Tucker.The wonderful script by Craig Borten and Melissa Wallack is saturated in character development. And even though the characters have their share of strengths and flaws, it scores high points in effectiveness and believability. The ingredient that makes this film very effective comes in terms of the relationships within the characters and that we were able to understand a complex character who's quite unlikable but still manages to hold a place in our hearts. Borten and Wallack succeed in avoiding overly done sentimentality and succeeds in keeping it standard which might seem dull to some viewers.Director Jean-Marc Vallee give this cinematic project a documentary feeling to it. It's never flashy and the story is executed as all the events are transpiring before our very eyes. We see no sympathy within the characters as no one's sugarcoated and that harder truths come uncompromising. It's not pretty, but straight to the point and leaves no stone unturned. It's not always pleasant, but life was never meant to be fair. And even though the production value lacks in connection, the style of storytelling makes this movie significant.When coming to see this movie, brace yourselves for two hours of engaging characters, who lack moral vibes while defending themselves against corporate shrills for the sake of a good cause. The movie depends on a motivating script intense performances and the realism involved. It won't change your life, but it will make you ponder who our government really cares for.",8,2,2,16 February 2015
Control," Shows That Not All Rockers Who Die Young Are Druggies
","Ian Curtis breaks away from the clichés of young rockers who died before their time. Instead of sex, drugs, alcohol and being totally messed up. Instead this individual has succumbed to a lifelong struggle with epilepsy, a disjointed marriage and the struggles that go with being a rock performer. 'Control' sets the record straight that go beyond the typical rocker biopic, but still we never truly see who the real Ian Curtis was and somehow we may really never know.Sam Riley stars as Ian Curtis, the frontman of the 1970's punk band Joy Division. I'm not giving away anything by saying that he committed suicide and made himself into an icon in the music world. The central stories behind Curtis in his battles with a troubled marriage, his battles with epilepsy, and his lust for a Dutch girl named Annik. Riley must have done his homework with his role as he is a standout in every way possible from his voice to his eccentric quirks. He does sing his songs and I take my hat off for that. Curtis was no Paul McCartney, but his voice did stand out above the rest and Riley succeeds in that area.From the movie we get a good overview as to just how melancholy Joy Division's music was really like. Other bands were not always that spontaneous but the nuances behind Curtis' cynical lyrics behind his singing makes the setting of dreary Manchester, England all the more apropos. Sure there might be a few exaggerations coming on here and there at times, but does not over do it like 'Walk the Line.' Instead it gives the viewer the chance to piece together the metaphoric puzzle. When he's at the unemployment office and young lady is having a seizure, this was the inspiration to their hit song 'She's Lost Control.' It's all in the matter of dissecting through the subliminal messages in the lyrics to get a better understanding of the modus operandi of Joy Division and what they write about. Sure the camera crew make it obvious as they show you around Curtis' troubled mind as they show us a series of sentimental books written by the likes of JG Ballard and William S. Burroughs or how enthusiastically wants to see 'Apocalypse Now'. So these tiny details demonstrate just what kind of character Curtis was like.The thing that irks me about musical biopics is that they hardly look into the creativity of a musician, singer or a group. In 'Control' we are treated to the drum tracking behind 'She's Lost Control'. And we can understand the strange hissing sound coming from a spray can. I wished that there would have been more screen time for the character who played Martin Hannett, Joy Division's demanding producer (we all thought Phil Spector was demanding). But in all respect, Hannett gets credit for creating the unusual sound that made Joy Division a league of their own. Sadly he was on for five minutes. Where did the group decide to use the bass guitar as the leading instrument and have the lead guitar demoted to background instrument (much like The Who where John Entwhistle's bass was more the leading instrument than the guitar). It could have been because Peter Hook was more available in studio than Bernard Sumner? Who knows?Overall, 'Control' is one of the more underrated musical biopics. Riley turns in one of his best performances as the troubled rocker and what influenced him in his shortened life. But Ian Curtis is still one of life's mysteries and we may never know much about him unless we actually sit down and talk to the surviving members of Joy Division, Bernard Summer, Peter Hook and Stephen Morris. You can listen to his music till your blue in the face, and still never able to unravel what's gone through the creator's head.",9,3,4,15 July 2013
Goon," Pays Homage To The Enforcers of Hockey.
","In hockey, we have the forwards which are the centres and the wingers who's main purpose is to score as many goals as possible. Then you have the defense who literally have to have eyes in the back of their heads because they're there to assist the forwards in scoring the goals and to prevent the forwards from the rival teams from getting closer to the goalie in their efforts to score a goal. Then you have the goaltender who's there to guard the net. And if the goalie lets too many goals in, you're guaranteed a bad day.Then you have the most overlooked members of a hockey team. They are the enforcers, the added muscle to the rough sport that is hockey and you ask yourselves what is their function on a hockey team besides muscle and publicity both good or bad? The answer to that is they're the protectors of the other players and are there to fight with the other muscles on the opposing teams. Such well-notable enforcers or as they're often referred to as 'goons' include Bob Probert, Marty McSorley, Tie Domi, Chris Nilan and Zdeno Chara. They were not known for their skills as players who can skate, score goals or were that defensive. They just got on took down rivals and sat in the penalty box. Sure there were some exceptional goons who were capable at scoring goals like Rick Tocchet, Cam Neely, Jerome Iginla even Mario Lemieux and Rocket Richard, most goons weren't well skilled at hockey, but can depend on muscle to carry their teams forward.This is one of the reasons I genuinely enjoyed the movie 'Goon' because it pays homage to the artistry of being an enforcer who in the past gets dismissed as being talent-deprived thugs just on to fight with members of the opposing team. to bring down the competition so that their team has an upper advantage for the win. Seann William Scott stars as Doug 'The Thug' Glatt, a bouncer who gets hired on the spot to be an enforcer for a minor league hockey team in Massachusetts. One of the qualities that make 'Goon' stand out is that Doug might be good at beating people up, that doesn't really necessarily make him toxic let alone a bully. In fact he could very be a thug with heart of gold. And even though he comes from a well-defined family of academics, he's the black sheep being that he's anything but academic. And though his family still believes he has potential, Doug tells them off he's not. Not that he's being modest, he just knows who he is and is not ashamed to admit he's dumb and that him wearing a hockey uniform and being hired to hurt players he has found his true calling.And sure the film might be saturated with a cornucopia of violent scenes that through every crunch, snap, crackle and pop everything looks and feels authentic, the movie itself isn't just dependent on its hardcore styled violent scenes. 'Goon' is also played from the heart as we have very well fleshed out characters and that the human interest elements are something fans who are into watching character-driven movies something that could be invested in. There is no team movie about who's winning or losing or about an underdog team pulling all the stops at the last minute to conquer the championship. It's about a rags-to-riches story of Doug's rise to fame a carving a life on his own.One day he watches a hockey game with his friend Pat (Jay Baruchel), who takes the pleasure of calling out rival hockey teams and belittling them. One player, not amused by Pat's obnoxious ways makes his way over to them and threatens to annihilate Pat. But Doug intervenes and clobbers the player going so far as to split open his helmet. Some scout take notes and then next thing you know, Doug has now become a hockey player. Though he wasn't born to skate, he's not on for that reason, he's there to take down rival teammates who pose a threat to his team.The character side of this story steams from Doug's privileged lifestyle. He's frequently pressured by his parents (Eugene Levy and Ellen David) that he has so much potential. Being that his father and brother Ira (David Paetkau) are both doctors, Doug understands that he will never excel to their levels of success and that his new role in professional hockey is a dream he never saw coming.Liev Schreiber was an unexpected surprise to play a supporting role as the rival goon Ross 'The Boss' Rhea. Rhea was once admired by Doug, but now that they're on opposing teams, we all know that sooner than later they will likely have a showdown in the end. Sure we are aware that the most contagious thing about hockey like other sports is that concussions have been greatly observed and deeply concerned by players, coaches, physicians and the higher-ups in sports organizations, here in 'Goon' we look at a different era in hockey before it became more watered down than it is today.Doug eventually befriends a player named Xavier LaFlemme (Marc-Andre Grondin) a star player who's getting on in age who serves as his protector from other goons. It feels as if the restrictions of violence in this era was catatonic. It would appear that Doug's position would be that he'd spend a portion of his time in the penalty box. The brutality depicted here through the roof.The movie does have some nice subtle romantic comedy touches that concentrate on Doug and his relationship with the promiscuous Eva (Alison Pill) who admits she's attracted to big, sweaty hockey players who's bruises and blood are sexier than their tattoos. Pill's comic relief compliments perfectly as she's the manipulator behind the naive nature of Doug's lovable characteristics.To debunk the negative stereotypes that enforcers are all muscles and no brains is a total misnomer. Take for example George Parros who plays nine seasons in the NHL in many different teams before retiring as a Montreal Canadien in 2014. He was as strong as an ox, but he was far from being as dumb as one. He was educated at Princeton University where he majored in economics with 3.18 GPA and scored 1250 on his SATs. That counteracts the big dumb jock analogy to the max.It should be noted that 'Goon' was based off of the non-fiction memoirs titled 'Goon: The True Story of the Unlikely Journey Into Minor League Hockey' by Adam Frattasio and Doug Smith. The real Doug Smith played 10 years in Minor League hockey on various teams from 1988-1998 and has done other lines of profession including a police officer, an author, and a coach in high school and Minor League Hockey association.",6,0,0,16 May 2020
American History X," Excellent Story With a Gripping Subject Matter Letdown By a Rushed Script
","There is no disputing that this movie is heavy-set on trying to unravel a message that both very provocative and also very powerful. The ever painful subject of racism whether it's educated or from the street, philosophical from the words of Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton), this movie will surely leave you with many thoughts popping through your mind once this movie is over.'American History X' is a without a doubt one of the most important movies that was released in the late 1990's. Once the smoke is cleared and everyone leaves the theatre, people will look back on it whether they liked the movie or they hated it, there is no doubt that Norton's performance will surely be further discussed. To me he was already a star when he was in 'Primal Fear' and sadly was robbed of an Oscar in that performance. The amazing versatility never ceases to amaze me the way Norton's went through to portray at one hand, a scary, fearsome Nazi skinhead complete with ripped muscles, a bald head, with a swastika branded on his heart, and yet behind his menacing appearance lies a saddened, confused lonely soul who's personal mission was to rectify from his erroneous ways. He is described as a very bright young man with bad intentions and hatred bottled up inside of him from the things he learned from his ethnic-hating late father and his constant struggle to find the real meaning of life.Eternally grief-stricken from a disjointed family, Derek's father's death lured Derek into the realms of Nazism it is quite original that the setting of this movie does not emanate from the South, but rather Venice Beach as a backdrop where hate crimes are quite frequent and rallies to play as Derek serves as the orator for these rallies to promote white supremacy.The turning point of the movie comes when two African-Americans try to steal Derek's car. Derek clad in only his underwear chases the men with a gun and mercilessly kills them both. Sure the scene was cold and graphic and not for the weak at heart, but when the police arrive, Derek is just standing there with a cold and evil grimace on his face, complete with a haunting musical score in the background. As this scene is happening, Derek is seen staring at his young brother Danny (Edward Furlong) who was a witness to the whole incident. Danny looks on at his brother who shows absolute no remorse for his actions, standing like a proud soldier who dished out justice his way. These brutal scenes are some of the most astounding scenes you will ever find on film. These scenes alone sells this movie successfully which is more I can say for the other very rushed and not very to the point scenes. Derek's prison time could have covered more ground, but this movie tried to cover too much details with very limited time.Excellent direction by Tony Kaye to highlight the past in black and white and color for the present events after Derek's discharge from prison. The execution is handled simplistic but brilliant as Derek finally home takes a hot shower for the first time in while, looks at himself and the branded swastika situated at his heart. His newly discovered shame his brought him to the point of rethinking all the bad things he's done as he covers the symbol of hate in his heart. Deep inside his heart, he looks back with regret and sorrow and rediscovery to find out what he could have done and what he can do to move forward in this new path of life he sets for himself. In spite of the often rushed script and some details that were left behind, 'American History X' is a powerful film that must be seen first before it can be judged.",8,1,3,23 September 2013
Tropic Thunder," Very Good Movie But A Tiring Plot
","'Tropic Thunder' is very high up there as one of 2008's more entertaining films and also shows that comedies don't necessarily have to go overboard with slapstick silliness or stupid repetitive one-liners. One of the main weak points however, was that the story tends to lack in any original concepts that it gets very average to say the least. The actors and their performances are what carries the movie and successfully transforms a rather mundane story into something incredibly riveting to show that comedies do have places in the Academy Awards. It just needs to be handled more productively and the right people to direct them.The story is about a group of thespians starring in a Vietnam War movie in hopes this bags in a few awards along the way. However, the director of this movie (Steve Coogan) decides to spruce things up a bit by putting his performers in the actual location where this alleged 'true story' took place and the actors find themselves in a precarious situation where real adversaries inhabit the location of where the movie is being shot. The comedy depends on the actors who unconsciously don't believe they're in danger.When you compare it to other comedies, like 'Zoolander', and 'Napoleon Dynamite' and whatnot, the comical elements have bee lowered down by quite a notch. Not to say 'Tropic Thunder' wasn't funny, but not as funny as I anticipated. The one who stood out was Robert Downey Jr. as an Australian Caucasian playing an African American as he gets into character and delivers some of the best lines in the movies. For all you sensitive viewers, fear not. There is no ounce of stereotyping in Downey's character. So please, don't take any kind of offence towards the character. I felt more offended when Christopher Walken played an Asian in 'Balls of Fury'. Even though Ben Stiller is the man of the hour in this movie, he still plays the same roles he's played in the past decade. Sure the naive schtick suits better in low-brow comedies he's been in, 'Tropic Thunder' just doesn't cut it here. Jack Black I like very much, but here he has little to do or say here which is sad because his comic antics could have been put to good use. In an odd twist in the story and a very unforgettable scenes pits Tom Cruise as the mentally unbalanced Les Grossman demanding the key grip to clobber the director. It strange because in most films, Cruise is playing it straight and cool. Here as Grossman, he comes off as sympathetic character who just has an uncontrollable cursing problem. I thought the creepy dancing scene near the end lacked the coherency of the movie which was very pointless. A wonderful movie overall, but I think the performers really poured their hearts out in giving us a comedy to look back and enjoy for many years to come. I just wished the writers found more comical moments instead of depending on the cast to carry the movie on their own. But I will say that it was brave of Downey to play a black man without trying to acting silly or even clichéd to the point where our ultra-sensitive viewers won't mash their teeth in anger. Go see it I assure you, you will be mesmerized.",7,2,4,1 February 2010
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Everything You'd Expect From An Adaptation To a Graphic Novel
","I'm not one enthused by reused romantic angles. You know the typical schmaltz you'd expect to find in teenage romantic comedies, where the awkward sensitive teenage boy falling smitten over the girl of his dreams, but can't get to her because she has certain obstacles that's getting in her way. She'll humor the boy in spite that her heart has been crushed several times before but through her own purposes. In films like this, the female is the one that does the dumping, not the other way around. 'Scott Pilgrim vs. The World' has a very similar story structure, but the twist that comes with the story is very iconic, that it will inspire you so much, you can easily accept the formulaic plot that the movie delivers. The audience would be treated to an exhibition of spectacular special effects, and the film making techniques are truly original. Michael Cera is back in full form as 22 year old Scott Pilgrim in another similar role he's played in other previous films as the charismatic geek trying to fulfill the girl of his dreams. Sure the plot sounds tiring and formulaic, but only this time a new format has changed making it more original than anticipated. His character falls for an EMO type girl named Ramona Flowers who is played to perfection Mary Elizabeth Winstead. Her dry humor and cynical wit truly makes an engaging character to look out for. What can you find in the plot? Simply put, picture yourself if you were living in a video game world, where you have the power to fly through the air, possess superhuman strength and to takes on all sorts of challenges to overcome all these assorted obstacles in your way. 'Scott Pilgrim vs. The World' takes advantage of these features and adds a lot of light-heart humor that carries the film in a subliminal fashion that compliments the story immaculately. So we have Scott Pilgrim, who's a 22 year old young man who's currently in a relationship with a 17 year old Asian girl Knives Chau (Ellen Wong), he has a gay ally (Kieran Culkin) who has more manly features than Pilgrim, but is always there to lend him advice. He's in a rock band and at one time dated the drummer. One day at a party, he was in cahoots with this girl, but sadly for Pilgrim, this girlfriend has possesses seven deadly exes destined to destroy Pilgrim. The rest of the story is like a comic book come to life as Scott engages in battle with these miscreants with moves that resemble the classic video game 'Mortal Kombat'. In order to like this movie you have to understand the quality of video games and to marvel at the brilliant lighting, the terrific sounding whenever opponents fall down in defeat. So to summarize, 'Scott Pilgrim vs. The World', is quite refreshing and very hilarious. It continually entertains till the very end and will leave you with plenty to remember.",8,2,7,17 May 2011
The Commitments," Ireland May Have Changed But The Music Lives Is Still Valid
","It's been 28 Years since Alan Parker directed the 1991 film 'The Commitments' and though Ireland has went through a major makeover in the last three decades, the music featured here has never lost its step. Based off of a novel by Roddy Doyle as part of his Barrytown Trilogy series about a folk band who's rise to fame was very short-lived, but the impact it had on the band member's lives was eternal. Much like the cobbling together a group is in similar fashion to Parker's other film 'Fame', 'The Commitments' looks into youth who live in destitute who have no music education program provided to them, so in order to make a name for themselves, they have to do all of this on their own, which is a very inspiring and satisfying movie.Set in Dublin, Ireland in the late 1980's , we are introduced to Jimmy Rabbitte (Robert Arkins) as an aspiring talent agent who has a dream. Though fearing doubt from his Elvis loving father Jimmy Sr. (Colm Meaney), Jimmy sets out on journey to audition a band of musicians to play soul music inspired by the likes of Aretha Franklin, Wilson Pickett and Otis Redding. With this new band, Jimmy hopes this band will become the next big breakout group this side of Emerson Isle.Under the name 'The Commitments', Jimmy's first acquisition is an older trumpet player named Joey 'the Lips' Fagan (Johnny Murphy) who claims to have jammed with soul performers back in the 1960's, though it's questionable if he really did or if he's just looking for opportunity. Either way he is fond of Jimmy's dream and wants in feeling this is an essential calling for a long-awaited comeback. He would be the band's team leader.As time goes on, other band members pass the auditions each bring their musical traits with them while all the members have diverse characterizations to keep the film rolling. As the band's lead singer is Deco Cuffe (Andrew Strong) is an enigma of character due to his high ego, uncouth mannerisms that are a turnoff towards the other band members but his vibrant singing pipes make up for all of his shortcomings. On drums we have Billy (Dick Massey) who's drums were obtained from a pawn shop. On bass there's Derek (Kenneth McCluskey) who practices during his free time when working at the slaughterhouse. On saxophone there's Dean (Felim Gromley) who has more interest in jazz than in soul. The group's guitarist Outspan Foster (Glen Hansard of the group Once) joins the fray. Finally we have keyboard player Steve (Michael Aherne) who performs the organ at the local church and has great fondness for Procol Harum. In addition to them, Jimmy hires three lady singers to provide backup for the group. They are Bernie (Bronagh Gallagher), Natalie (Maria Doyle) and Imelda (Angelina Ball) who everyone in the band seems to be attracted to the most.The movie focuses in the immediate success of the band and also embodies the grave reality that all good things don't last forever. From the clunky rehearsals in the pool hall attic to the wowing of the fans in local pubs and nightclubs to the sad breakup due to personal reasons, massive egos, and bitter lack of co-existing from fellow band members. It shows that even though making a band looks easy at first glance is much harder to maintain. Aside from the musical standpoint of this movie, the audience gets a tour of the squalor conditions the musicians lived where their hopes and dreams were tarnished due the economic collapse back then. But performing as The Commitments, the singers and musicians have been offered something they never had before which was confidence. Through their confidence, they now can look back on their experiences as a way to guide them through whatever endeavors they wish to pursue in life. Aside from the musical performances and the dramas each individual are facing, there is some comedic moments in this movie as well. From Deco's erratic mannerisms to Jimmy's begging for favours, to the handling of their bouncer (Dave Finnegan) who Jimmy hires and later become the groups drummer, and Joey's fondling with the girl backup singers.According to Alan Parker during an interview featured on the Blu-ray, he spent weeks looking for local talent to audition for his movie, which is amusingly similar to the scenes where Jimmy is listening in on the various genres of music each band member plays during his auditions. The musicians portrayed here may have had some musical experience, but a lot of them were first time actors, with the exception of Johnny Murphy who needed private lesson to play the trumpet. With combined singing and music to the tracks, Parker was able to successfully cover such soul classics like 'Mustang Sally', 'Try a Little Tenderness', and 'Chain of Fools'. In fact the sounds were so good, they eventually were made into a two albums that came out in 1991. When award season came up, Gary Hambling was nominated for Best Editing in a movie. This falls in the category of a great underdog story of ragtag destitute musicians finding their way through their doldrums in gaining the gift of confidence that was never given to them before. They pushed the boundaries they never thought they had and made something of themselves. Sure they're no Van Morrison, but the're no longer pathetic chumps.If you are a fan of soul music, you might find this movie 'The Commitments' will hold a special place in your heart. The film succeeds in keeping the music real, the characters believable and the locations real. In the end you will sing your hearts out.",9,0,0,8 December 2019
Quantum of Solace," Good Action, But Not a Bond Story At Al
","For those action junkies who came to see a solid action flick with plenty of explosions and fight scenes will be moderately entertained. However, if you're here to see a Bond flick with the traditional Bond themes we've relished all those years, well there's always the video stores to find classic Bond because you find any of the formula that pays homage to the Ian Fleming adaptation of 007 like the others before 'Quantum of Solace'. In most James Bond movie our suave hero goes through his days with his flawless appeal, his witty one-liners, his cool gizmo's and whatnot's and the occasional slug fest when needed. Here, all you see is violence without a story to go around. It looked and felt more like a straight arrow action flick rather than a compelling Bond story that we've adulated to over the nearly 50 years. In fact all the story is just a narrow continuation to where Bond left off by getting revenge over Vespar Lynde's (Eva Green) murder and nothing more. Sure it makes for a believable sequel, but the villains in the plot are purely banal. I always yearned for a Blofeld type Bond villain, cunning, insane, driver for world domination, but here, it just doesn't exist. The motives of the villains is just plain pathetic.What's the purpose of controlling Bolivia's water and charging people extra then they usually pay for? There's no point to it at all? They're poor as it is already. It's not going to make these villain richer than they were before. Please spare me!",5,3,6,18 January 2010
Legends of the Fall," Very Flawed With Impressive Technical Features
","Like the instincts of a sad puppy dog, 'Legends of the Fall' is likely enough to manipulate the audience by staring at you in the eyes, jump at you and salivate at you with their big red tongues. It's an unsettling story that's way too oratorical for my tastes and seems more dependent on style over substance, but for some reason I can't explain, it still lured me because it was very entertaining. I could rattle on for hours of all the flaws in this movie, and yet after all the ranting I still find something that made this movie at least worthwhile. And the main element that made this film worthy to view comes in one person and his name's Brad Pitt. Just Pitt's performance alone eradicates all the flaws that have materialized in the entire movie alone.Situated in the great state of Montana in the early 20th century, it tells the tale of the Ludlow family as Col. William Ludlow (Anthony Hopkins) decides to resign from military life after getting frustrated over the government's neglecting the policies over Native People. The story begins in the year 1914 when the youngest of the three Ludlow brothers Samuel (Henry Thomas) introduces his family towards his new fiancée, Susannah (Julia Ormond). But her welcoming has quite a chain reaction because the oldest Ludlow brother Alfred (Aidan Quinn) is also smitten by her presence, but she has her eyes set on the middle son, Tristan (Brad Pitt). Soon the three brothers follow their father's legacy and go off to fight in the First World War. Sadly one of the brothers gets killed and a love triangle ensues between the surviving two brothers and leaving poor Susannah in the middle.For the opening half hour I actually was glued to the seat. At first I was given the impression that this movie was going to be a good, wholesome family drama with tons of positive issues going for it. All the performances were quite brilliant and the exchange in dialogues by the Ludlow Brothers felt natural like they really were brothers and the pacing was perfect in a way that it was neither rushed or lagging, but right in the middle. But once the brothers journey off to Europe, the movie starts to fall apart and never has time to recover. One minute I'm enjoying this confidently made movie and then next thing you know it falls off the tracks and like a bumpy ride you feel yourself relived that it's finally over. What transpires in this rubble is Tristan travelling the globe with a guilty conscious while he's selling alcohol to the Irish and we're treated to three funerals. And by making the story feel like a Native American legend, we see Tristan mysteriously befriending a bear, which not only looks comical, but contrived.Though the script and the performances may have looked awkward, I would have to say that the technical features. In 1989, director Edward Zwick created a brilliant atmosphere when he made 'Glory' and he follows this flow with him in 'Legends of the Fall'. The war scenes look identical to 'Glory' with only contrasting uniforms. John Toll's photography located in Alberta and British Columbia (passing off as Montana) is picturesque and that one scene where Susannah is reading a note as she walks through the coniferous trees was absolutely stunning. The musical score by James Horner is as smooth to the ears that you might hum to easily. As the story seems to progressively lack, the sights and sounds of 'Legends of the Fall' get better through time.In spite of all that the best casting choice Zwick provides for us is the performance of Brad Pitt. From the early start, Pitt grabs our attention Sure he has to carry himself through the bloated melodramatic moments, but it's that intensity that plays a pivotal part in this role and is voided from being overdone and his tearful moments don't look superficial like crocodile tears that some of the male performers provide. The letdown here is that Pitt fades away from the narrative in substantial periods of time as the other Ludlow brothers and Susannah become the central characters. Which is too bad because the characters lack the panache to keep the audience from drifting off. The last fifteen minutes wraps up quite nicely with a retribution message similar to that in 'The Godfather', but it hits the spot in this movie. All I can say now is that 'Legends of the Fall' lacks originality and at times becomes a bit awkward. However, if you could put a mega-star in a Western film, it can only come across as satisfying enough to just be almost like a guilty pleasure.",6,3,6,11 March 2013
No Country for Old Men," The Story Is A Sad Waste
","I have been a fan of the Coen Brother's work, especially 'Fargo' and 'Blood Simple' and 'The Big Lebowski'. These movie are innovative and entertaining. I wish I could say the same for 'No Country for Old Men', but then I would be lying. This movie was a complete waste. That doesn't mean everything was bad. The execution was handled nicely, the cinematography looked stunning, and the acting was top notch. But the story led to no direction and I started to to become pretty irritable at what I was observing. The story, not once showed any signs of sympathy towards the characters. The bad guys seem to outwit the good guys in everything making them unstoppable. I like it when the good guys win, clichÃ©d yes, but I would've liked to see justice served much better. I wanted to leave the theater so badly, but I bought the ticket and I was hoping for something unpredictable to happen. It never did! I ask myself, what was going through the Coen's heads to make an adaptation of this very disturbing novel. No insult to Cormac McCarthy, but through reading this book, the subject matter was too drab, cynical, and not very supportive of this dreary cause. The shooting of this film is noteworthy that it's set in blinding daylight. Not my idea of entertainment.This is storytelling at its worst. The ugliness of this story is too much for me to handle. I advise you to avoid this movie at all costs. In the end you'll thank me for it.",5,1,4,12 January 2009
District 9," A Film That Will Have You Thinking
","My friends have thought 'District 9' was a bit melancholy and and hard to hold back the tears. Although I respect their feelings about the movie, I like to depend on my point of view by drawing out the good qualities and the qualities the could have used a little more improvement. What made my friends sickened most about 'District 9' wasn't really the film itself, but how low humanity in cinema and society have been depicted as of late. Not the characters per say, but how our prejudices and discrimination have grown. As a society, we continually fight against each other for unnecessary purposes other than just for the sake of empowerment; just like the way the human characters were portrayed in battling the aliens in this movie. In agreement to my friends, I think their theory was true. Sure there were some humans in the movie who were fighting for the cause of protecting the aliens, but they were just the bottom of the demographics and their voices of opinion were null and void. Set in the centerfold of human destruction of other humans, it comes to no surprise that South Africa was the obvious choice for this movie to take place. After all, this movie summarizes the wars we had with each other in the past. In South Africa, the defunct Apartheid Act which lasted for almost 50 years saw the Caucasian minority try to bring down the black majority through acts like segregation and whatnot. It also reflects on the wars in North America between the European settlers against the Native people and the African-Americans, or in Europe when the Nazis condemned the Jews in the Holocaust. The war between the humans and the aliens demonstrate on how despicable and uncaring we as humans had become then as as are now.I can see why a lot of critics lambasted the way humanity was painted here. But you have to understand that they weren't doing it vainly to insult us, but just to show us our behavior tactics we have when encountering someone (or in this case something) that is different from all of us. That's why it may not be suitable for the sensitive audience.Granted this movie is uber-violent and the F bombs are aplenty, but unlike some of those mindless summer flicks like 'GI Joe' among others, 'District 9' has an actual story and delivers a powerful message to the human race and gives us a wake-up call as to how evil we really are when we're at war with another group that isn't like us. Last year in the theaters, every patron stayed in their seats. No one got up for popcorn or candy. Everyone stayed in their chair and watched the movie almost like they were in a church ceremony. I could give the excuse that with troubled economic stages in our life, the patrons decide to go frugal, or the tickets purchased were too expensive it left a hole in their wallets. But no I think they really were hooked into this movie ceremoniously.",8,1,8,24 May 2010
Mamma Mia!," A Definitive Girls Night Out
","When I came to the premiere of 'Mamma Mia!' last year, it was flooded with couples bringing their loved ones to be amused, entertained and humming to the beat of their classic song from the 1970's Swedish pop band ABBA. The ladies were having a ball, and were laughing hysterically at every joke and every well-timed spoof. Some of them, sang and even a danced along, making it an evening they'll never forget. Even a guy like me was enjoying the moment in a more subtle way.What got me into the mood was the crowd-pleasing movie, the props, the sets and of course, the always charismatic Meryl Streep. This time, she takes herself to a new level, by underplaying her role and keeping it sublime. Sure in musicals, it's normal to be over-the-top, and it gave her a chance to sing, which she rarely does in her films. Which is a shame because she has a natural singing voice.Unfortunately, Pierce Brosnan is not cut out for musicals. His antics on the screen are overdone, which is good. But, his singing voice can only be deemed as average at best. It's like he's only there for the drama and not much on the music. The Greek Island is thing of traveller's eye-candy. The beautiful location. With the material provided, it was the perfect setting for this story to commence. Sure we modest men are afraid to admit it, but you can't deny that ABBA is the best thing to come along in Sweden since the invention of the printing press (Johan Guttenberg). Sure it can be one-note in their tone, but if you listen carefully to the lyrics and to leave out the beat of the music you'll be surprised at the subliminal message behind their lyrics and the go together with the silly story.So my advice, to those married couples when your wife asks to see 'Mamma Mia!' just go with them enjoy the night out, regardless that it's not manly enough for you. You can even just sit there eating your popcorn if you have to. After the movie's over you can go back to your manly ways again.",7,2,3,15 March 2010
Twilight," A Surprise for The Open-Minded
","If you have complete adulation for the series novels that you can memorize every line, scene and characters and their traits, then I would advise you to stay way from this movie. However, if you have neglected to watch, the trailers, clippings and being flippant towards those cynical naysayers or idol panderers, then this movie might not be your meal ticket. And to those who wish to go to the theaters thinking it's okay to randomly condemn the movie because it's cool, maybe then you should do something else. And finally, if you were expecting a mindless vampire flick with blood, blood and more blood, I suggest you go home and rent a 'Blade' movie instead. But if you're just out for an unforgettable evening, and sit back and watch the latest novel-to movie adaptation forgetting about your troubles, then this is the movie for you. Let those crazed kids scream for their celluloid idols all they want, but as long as your mind is fresh and expect what you've come to expect, you're going to enjoy 'Twilight'. You might want to take in consideration that it's not the actors that carried the film, but the lengths that were taken in making the movie is what makes this movie special. The low budget it took should mean something. At under $40 million to create something very riveting show quality will always beat quantity. Other trial and tribulations was that it was filmed in a new studio, behind schedule and horrid working conditions. The makers never expected this movie was going to be cult film, they assumed that they were making an independent novel adaptation. For those who are taking notes and drawing comparisons to the novel, be warned, the crew had to make changes to characters and scenes may have been added or shrunk or even left out just to cram it into making a two hour film. They may have given more air time for the evil vampires to show their stuff. There was some humorous moments (some more than others), but doesn't entirely try to take itself too seriously. The direction is hit or missed in some areas, but still remained very nuanced. Some editing could have been better, like the meadow scenes that seemed to go on for too long.Overall the performances were pretty good Robert Pattinson turned in a very good performance as the sensitive vampire Edward Cullen. Kristin Stewart had a believable role as Bella Swan, but at times her character can be a bit too stoic for my tastes. Peter Facinelli was wonderful as the good doctor there to cured all ills and at the same time show his patronage to the Cullens. Some of the other Cullens could have had more air time, however, Nikki Reed was impressive in her supporting role and Ashley Greene was both cute and scary as Alice. Billy Burke as the over-protective father had a humor factor that any teenager could identify with. Taylor Lautner was the best choice to cast him as Jacob, who has potential to grow in future sequels. Rachelle LeFavre and Cam Gigandet excelled as the evil vampires, sadly Edi Gathegi was a little over-the-top but he was underused so he didn't ruin the movie that much. I hope LeFevre can be seen in the next sequel because she was extremely fun to watch. The lesson to be learned about this movie folks is that great movies are not from the wallet, but from the heart. The lengths it took to make this movie stands on its on merits. Sure it wasn't perfect, but it was a good watch. Though it's not for everyone, it still deserves a bit of praise. Give it chance, you might change your mind about this film a second or third time around.",7,0,2,8 March 2010
Bridesmaids," Fun Film Even When Some Scenes Don't Work
","Through most of their life, Annie (Kristen Wiig) and Lillian (Maya Rudolph) have been the best of friends almost closer than sisters from another mother. So when Lillian ties the knot, it's only naturally that she asks Annie to be her Maid of Honour. Things start to get a bit steamy when the insecure Annie starts to feel some tensions when Lillian's posh new friend Helen (Rose Bryne) starts to steal her thunder. Annie's life is really falling apart at the seams right now. Her boyfriend Ted (Jon Hamm) is being a jerk, her roommates are giving her grief and a kindly Officer Rhodes (Chris O'Dowd) is getting rejected by his passion for her because she's not sure about him, even though he let her go without a ticket in spite of her car having a broken tail-light. Will Annie rectify herself from her problems and will she and Lillian reunite their friendship?It's a tale about true friendship, resentment, romance, humour, and everything from fashionable trendiness to toilet jokes. For the most part it's mostly played for satire largely in part due to Wiig's sharp comic timing and and the brilliant script she co-wrote wrote with Amy Mumolo. Like her alum from 'Saturday Night Live' Tina Fey, Wiig succeeds in staying oblivious in situations she shouldn't and gets kudos for remaining that way throughout.Like any good comedy, 'Bridesmaids' has serious undertones where stakes are at the most quite surmountable. The quirks of the film further explore the angst and the insecurities these women face and the girl-talk is not complete overkill.The opening scenes has Annie and Ted having intercourse and looks like they're having fun, until we realize it's anything but as Ted reveals to the viewers he's no charmer ans kicks her out of his place. Then we see Annie friend Lillian showing off a beautiful diamond ring, Annie was happy for Lillian, that is until her fiance's boss' wife Helen enters the fray (Byrne was perfect here) and then things start to get quite heated. This makes Annie worried that her best friend isn't all that best as she thought. A funny scene where they engage in musical speeches where one tries to usurp one another and they end up singing That's What Friends Are For.There were a few scenes where the jokes did not work like for instance the scene where the bridesmaids were invited to a Brazilian steak restaurant before entering the boutique bridal shop under Helen's financial advantage and every one of them ends up getting food poisoning. There is a totally grossed out scene where they used a washbasin as a toilet. The mastermind behind this evil scheme is the groom's rotund sister Megan (played with some scene-stealing perfection by Melissa McCarthy). Another scene has Megan literally grinding her teeth into Annie to unravel some home truths while the ladies were on route to Las Vegas.Although there are men in this movie as well, they are pretty much in the background, though we are welcomed to by the warmly character of Officer Rhodes who has a thing for cupcakes while she eats carrots on the sunrise of his car bonnet. And the funniest scene where purposely commits mischief just to get his attention like speeding, drinking and texting and so on. What makes this script work is that the scenes just flow organically. It never feels staged or just branched out skits from 'Saturday Night Live'.We like to participate on the madcap misadventures that Annie takes pursuit in as her life has hit rockier times and it takes this journey ahead to get herself back together again. And granted there are scenes that work most of the time, there are some that don't and just tend to drag, but that few and far between. 'Bridesmaids' has high energy and shows that even women can also engage in physical comedy just as effectively as the men, but the journey ahead keeps us invested into the world of friendship and marriage and regaining the will to live.",8,2,3,24 June 2019
Man on the Moon," Energetic Jim Carrey Channeling His Inner Andy Kaufman
","In 'Man on the Moon', Jim Carrey dishes it his elastic-like energy to a different direction in his portrayal of the legendary comedian and master manipulator Andy Kaufman (1949-1984). Director Milos Forman gives us a full-depth look into the eyes of this unpredictable genius who rose to super-stardom, raising eyebrows and creating controversy wherever he went. In his short time on Earth, Kaufman accomplished a lot more than we could only dream about. The track by R.E.M. can be heard in our heads the entire time as we follow Kaufman in his weird world that he lives in and Jim Carrey brings us along for the zany, crazy ride. Carrey shows us why he was the perfect casting choice to play the part of Andy Kaufman because like Kaufman, Carrey is a master when it comes to impersonation. Every quirky event comes here; from portraying the wide-eyed Foreign Man to wrestling women, to reading of 'The Great Gatsby' and to lip-syncing the theme song to 'Mighty Mouse', it all comes to life and Carrey just nails his scenes perfectly.Even though Kaufman's memorable moments were brought to life here, we still feel left with several curious questions that are still left unanswered that will for the rest of our lives remain privately kept and unknown. We never full understand why he turned out the way he did or what makes him tick, because we're only given emphasis based on the things the mainstream knows about and very little on his life outside the limelight. Because of this flaw, the mystery of who Andy Kaufman is remains in the dark. From my personal observations, this movie is left to give us the impression that Andy was more weightless to his audiences than he was to himself. 'Man on the Moon' is another big extravagant picture which collaborates Milos Forman along with his screen writing partners Scott Alexander and Larry Karazewski brought vibrancy and passion to the 1996 film 'The People vs. Larry Flynt' which was rich in its characters and situations. 'Man in the Moon' we are treated to the events that we already know about, but in the end we know very little about him, which makes everything rather opaque. Maybe because Kaufman himself was self-conscious of his life, or maybe I just wanted more than what we know. In spite of this major faux pas, 'Man on the Moon' is able to trace back the important moments in Kaufman's life successfully and Jim Carrey channels in his inner Kaufman very convincingly. Under great artistic structuring, Kaufman's moments are played out straightforward but also faithfully as he wows the packed audiences with his clever but quirky mind games while Carrey adds touches of his own comedy style to make things all the more brighter. Make no doubts about it, Kaufman came a long way with the eternal belief that life's a stage and we all have our parts. From his early years growing up in Great Neck, New York to success as a comedian, TV star master of the manipulation, it was shame that a lot of the people in Andy's life wasn't given that same amount of attention as the man himself. The only one closest was Danny Devito (who was a co-star of his on the show 'Taxi') playing the sole true friend of his as agent George Shapiro and cared about this eccentric comedian the whole way through. The other honourable mention is the performance by versatile actor Paul Giamatti as another close associate to Mr. Kaufman's Bob Zmuda who was Kaufman's co-writer and conspirator who was behind the creation of one of Kaufman's infamous alter-ego, Tony Clifton. Clifton made several appearances time and time again even on the show 'Taxi' often appeared at his comedy club delivering aggressive humour, along with pudgy cheeks, black moustache and a thick Brooklyn New York accent. Like Kaufman, Clifton was also fascinated with wrestling women. And even that is only seen in fragments.It's a biopic that explores the memorable moments of Andy Kaufman's life and Jim Carrey does an excellent job of recreating the comedian who entertained us in the 1970's and 1980's and the events that take place are all very involving and energetic. The movie itself shows only small fragments of these events and the characters in Andy's life are only just there for the moment leaving very little in development. It's still funny and very exciting watch about an unpredictable man going to great lengths to tease its audience.",7,0,0,16 August 2017
The Pianist," The Odd Couple Featuring Beautiful Music Mixed With Extreme Hate
","It doesn't come very often that we are bear to witness something incredible that doesn't happen very often that works so well like two peas in a pod. Not only are we engaged to the scintillating sounds of beautiful piano music, while view the misfortune horrors of the epicenter of World War II, Warsaw Poland.Based on a true story of iconic musician Wladyslaw Szpilman, (Adrien Brody) you get this feeling of pity for the poor man and the horrors he faces throughout the movie and in hopes that nobody has to go through what he had to do to survive in this horrible war. But at the same time, it gives you that sense of gratitude that we (at least I hope) should never take life for granted and that we should love the life we live and to be lucky that we don't live in fear like Mr. Szpilman encountered in war-torn Nazi Poland. To be very blunt, Poland in WWII was no vacation spot, especially if you were of Jewish faith. Picture yourself in that era, your home is in rubble, your family and your friends all perished all the while trying to survive in one impossible situation after another. Left alone and the only food to eat was garbage and picking money off corpses is definitely no way to live. Mr. Szpilman faced this terror and to that it makes him a true war hero. Sure he bared no arms or was a soldier by any means, but his contribution to fighting the enemy was to sooth the savage beast, by way of ear-candy music.Director Roman Polanski's direction was one of the very best as he captures all the details to near perfection as he recreates the graphic imagery as a ploy to keep it audience gasping in deep emotion.Even the colors depicted here are very dark and drab as it symbolizes an era where bright vibrant colours is nowhere in sight. The green grass will only be given to us if we can stay on towards the end without trying to reach out for tissue paper. We all have the dishonour to explore the cattle scenes, where thousands of Jewish people get carried away on freight trains where they are being put to death. The scene itself is detailed enough to just metaphorically rip your heart out in two, just the locking of the doors and screaming pleas from actual human inside will make even a grown man cry. We also have the displeasure of witnessing the brutal humiliation the Jewish people suffered during these painful times. It's the ultimate insult to injury that truly comes to life here. But the realism is what makes this film so captivating and for that alone I give all my respects to Roman Polanski.Another reason 'The Pianist' is so extraordinary is the performance by Adrien Brody. He practically brings Szpilman to life in all his defenceless struggles to survive and that is by far no simple task. His changes through the film is quite sublime as he goes from a classy and honoured musician to a long-suffering misfit who still feels he has to move on and love music as his only escape through life. His survival instincts really wears you in places you've only dream of before. as the film progresses we see the man's physical torture show as his legs become shattered and his body in constant quivers and his mouth is manifested with scurvy and his eyes lighting up with every minute he survives every deadly predicament. But his magic fingers still manages to stay in tack as he still has the stamina to strike beautiful notes on a dusty and dirty piano.This movie is a movie no home should be without. The lingering effects will likely stay with you for days or even weeks. We can only hope that these terrible events don't come our way, but with the amount of hate that our world faces, let's not hold our breaths. So the next time you feel blue or manifested with lingering anger, keep this movie within you at all times. It may make us feel better of ourselves and that things can be a lot worse. And that in-spite of the awful events that occurred in this movie, beautiful music is around to sooth the wounds that come alive in 'The Pianist.'",9,1,2,5 November 2012
1941," A Box Office flop To Some, But A Guilty Pleasure to Me
","If you like war-themed comedies like 'Kelly's Heroes', 'MASH' and sitcoms like 'Hogan's Heroes' didn't tickle your funny-bone, maybe Steven Spielberg has the key to find your sense of humour. When it came out in 1979, '1941' was custom made for fans who want to avoid subtle comedy and love their comedy to be loud, punchy and over-the-top. Sadly, this movie failed at the box office, But when I got the DVD, I actually enjoyed it, not like in a life-changing perspective, sort of like a guilty pleasure.There was once a rumour that went on the before Robert Stack ('Unsolved mysteries') took the role of General Stilwell, dramatic actors like John Wayne and Charlton Heston were considered for the part. But they rebuffed at the request because of their military background, they thought this movie was irreverent to the real Pearl Harbor incident.However, setting of the story is real and the details were very accurate. In the year 1941, Americans had a look of concern after they bombed the Japanese, fearing that the Japanese would retaliate by bombing the United States, particularly California as the entire city of Los Angeles was abuzz with fear, paranoia and it showed America at war with a different perspective in their emotional stances. Not to offend anyone, but Americans have made us think that they were brave, fearless and practically laughed in the face of danger. But here we see a refreshing look that proves otherwise. American soldiers were no different from other nations as fear, insecurity and uncertainty was manifesting through the minds of millions of Americans. Japan actually got their revenge, but it was in Washington State, but it didn't last long. Americans protected themselves by setting up concentration camps towards Asian-Americans.And yet, Spielberg had succeeded to take the time to actually find reason to laugh at all the hysteria. No wonder Wayne and Heston refused to participate in the movie. Sadly for them, this movie was absolutely hilarious in a slapstick manner that works on many levels. the plot was quite narrow thin, just a plethora of gags and spoofs that carry the film in its two hour duration. It may not be for everyone, but before you make any judgments, see it for yourself, even if its for a rental.The DVD extras feature some very special tidbits, but one of my favourite feature is the 'making of' and the cast interviews. There's a cornucopia of details in that relates to the scenes featured and scenes they attempted, but didn't quite work including the torpedo coming after civilians. Mr. Spielberg takes the liberty to showcase some home movies that he filmed himself as an inspiration for the making of his project.The cast is filled with top notch comical actors including the late John Belushi, Dan Ackroyd, John Candy, Slim Pickens among others. Not to mention lesser comical performers like Christopher Lee, Robert Stack, Tosiro Mifune and Treat Williams.The interface can at times be quite troubling. For instance when selecting a scene, it shows sets of six per scene. Unlike other DVD's in this movie, choices are not featured unless you press ENTER. Unless you remember the scene options you will likely be lost. It's unorthodox that they refrained from automatic switching like on every other DVD. It may not be anamorphic, but it's still in letterbox.If you're into comedy especially the crazy antics of John Belushi and company as it spoofs a weak point in American history during WWII. And if you're all good sports about a comedy poking fun at a time when there was little to laugh about, then you might enjoy this movie. Even if this movie is not your cup of tea, at least check it out before you start to cast the first stone.",7,0,2,20 October 2014
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," I Still Like The Original Better
","Unlike the previous 'Planet of the Apes' film, 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' may have had the simians upgraded in their level of smarts, but it's the jilted dialogue within the performers that held back its fullest potential.From the lacking Oscar speech from actor James Franco, this movie marks the first time a live-action film was nominated for an Oscar where the views and perspectives are seen through the eyes of a responsive ape who has the capabilities to function like a human, who can plan, organize and be the catalyst towards a revolution and can bond nicely with the viewers watching. That's all very provocative and insightful and has everything you would want in a blockbuster summer film, but the movie loses substantial points due to the dialogue which was very limp and not very well structured.I may have seen tons of movie sequels and reboots and remakes, but as a huge fan of the original 1968 'Planet of the Apes' with Charlton Heston, I still find myself asking, why can't Hollywood leave well enough alone. Does every good film have to spawn into a franchise where the sequels never measure up let alone the remakes? With the advanced CGI that was used to make 'Avatar', seeing a person dressed as an ape has become nothing more than an afterthought. Now we have Andy Serkis who once again finds himself playing a non-human character by way of capture technology. Here he plays Caesar, an intelligent simian who's educational merit deprives of anything that was magical about the original 'Planet of the Apes' movies.He got his advanced intelligence when a pharmacy scientist Will Rodman (Franco) was hoping to find a cure for his senile father (an always impressive John Lithgow) who was suffering from Alzheimer's disease. He was working on an antidote that might rectify the damaged brain tissues that cause your brain to progressively malfunction. Caesar's parents was one of Will's experimental projects but was annexed due their violent outbursts. Will does the only humane thing by letting Caesar go to live with him as a father.When I saw this movie, I thought about a documentary I saw titled 'Project Nim' which focuses on a chimpanzee who was very capable of learning by being home-schooled. Chimpanzees are the main subjects to film these days. After all they come closest in the animal kingdom to adapt to human interaction. Maybe one day they might even surpass us if we're lucky or unlucky depending on your point of view.Although James Franco is great performer, his role isn't all that convincing. It's mainly due to the hack effort script by Amanda Silver and Rick Jaffa. The dialogue seems to be lowered to 'what are you saying'? The plot points just seem to go on like were being spoon-fed. Is it just me or does director Rupert Wyatt think that people who like summer blockbusters are dumber than apes?The initial climax escalates when the mighty Caesar (Hail Caesar!) leads his fellow chimps on an epic revolt in San Francisco across the Golden Gate Bridge. I was hoping we were going to witness a King Kong moment where Caesar would be romantically infatuated over a Jane Goodall wannabe primate specialist played by Frieda Pinto. But not the case. Instead we're left in the wings as the film morphs into another sequel in the franchise. It was a good effort that caught my attention but came up short. Hopefully the sequel will be better. Only time will tell. Until then the 1968 film is still the best of them all.",6,0,0,20 November 2016
Drive," Give A Thumbs Up For Refn
","Though not a high-prolific director, Denmark born Nicolas Winding Refn was a driving force behind this invigorating thriller Drive. Sure it was run on a meagre budget; Refn takes this movie with pride and does everything he could to make it all that captivating. Granted it was only until recently that I have heard about the director, let alone most of the cast (with a few exceptions). Ryan Gosling never looked so cold and calculating since his 2002 villainous performance as Richard Haywood in 'Murder by Numbers'. The simplistic plot is very involving for me because I am just a sucker for loner individuals being that as an Aspie I am one myself. Refn embarks his audience on a structured journey around the streets of Los Angeles as we follow our unnamed socially deprived Driver (Gosling). Mr. Driver lives a double-life, he's a stunt-player in the movie industry by day and he's a getaway driver at night. He goes by a routinely strict protocol by offering you 5 minutes of his own service, after that it's all up to you. From the opening scenes we can see our protagonist that the he has a very laid-back in his approach and seems to obey all the traffic rules and he's quite a good car mechanic as well.The principal shortcomings of Mr. Driver are that the emotional urges come across as his perpetual liability. In his humble apartment, we get acquainted by his neighbour Irene (Carrie Mulligan) and her young son Benecio (Kaden Leos). Mr. Driver takes them under his wing after their car breaks down nearby at the shop where Dr. Driver works. Mr. Driver's boss Shannon (Bryan Cranston) assures that Irene and her kid will be driven home safely. But it isn't before long that Mr. Driver spends more time with Irene on a regular basis. As the connection between the two deepens, no sooner Irene's husband Standard (Oscar Isaacs) has come back after spending some time in prison and the tensions begin to become intense. Mr. Driver's affection towards Irene manifests to epic proportions as Standard takes a beating from the mob at the garage because he owes them protection money. This lead s to Mr. Driver to break out of his routine and rescues Irene's husband. Inadvertently, Mr. Driver becomes better acquainted with the mob lead by the stoic Bernice Rose (Albert Brooks) and his business partner Nino (Ron Perlman).When it comes to pacing I will have to dismiss those naysayers who said that 'Drive' runs at a snail's pace. In fact I thought Refn did an incredible job in exploiting the constant sense of uneasiness that runs its course throughout the film. He knows when to let intensity build up and when to slow things down when needed which makes it all look real and natural. The chemistry was pretty convincing most of the time. Okay Gosling's performance was standard, but it was all part of his character, solitary, no family or friends to turn to, and maybe a handful of antagonists. He's quite an enigma in character, but he can be very volatile when he's protecting Irene. He's actually very fun to watch. The supporting cast also turns in very compelling performances as well. Brooks and Perlman were unmerciful as the diabolical mobsters. The car chases are executed quite nicely as well as the sounds and colours remain splendidly subliminal and the violent scenes come in at the right time and the cars are so astonishing and good looking.The musical background by Chris Martinez was treating to the ears as it pays homage to the techno sounds of the 1980's. It represents the emotional instability of Gosling's character. The sounds of the synthesizer throughout the movie gives you a true glance adds the right texture to this stylized and well substantial film.",8,1,5,25 June 2012
2012," This Will Not Likely Happen Two Years From Now
","When I came to the theaters last year to see the disaster movie '2012', I came in expecting, earthquakes, tsunamis, volcano eruptions and civilians facing their greatest fears in the ultimate battle for survival. An ideal overview of what could possibly happen on that faithful date of December 21st, 2012 when supposedly the end of the world will take place. I have a bit of mixed feelings about this movie. And the pros and the cons seem equally balanced. On the one hand, the acting was overall pretty good, for a movie that should've been released around the time summer blockbusters are released. But what was a turn-off mostly was that this movie's running time was too long. Perhaps some much-needed editing was in great need of desire. Certain scenes are greatly not needed and others scene just took too long to unravel. The special effects was absolutely spectacular. Director Roland Emmerich has been wowing his audience with special effects ever since his 1996 monster blockbuster 'Independence Day'. And once again, the explosions and blowups never cease to amaze me as it always leads to an exciting ride. The other flaw beside the overlong running time, is the script. There was not one believable scene that would likely happen in a battle for life and death. I mean come on, I can take the thrills and spills, but I assure you that that in 2012, there will be no planes going through flying buildings, or people jumping out of a cargo plane at rapid speed off a snowy mountain. The whole idea of this end of the world movie is utterly ridiculous. Whoever believes this these events are going to happen in the next few years are as naive as they come. And this has happened once too many times in an Emmerich film. He's notorious for hiring top performers in the industry, throw in some dazzling effects to keep us from leaving the theater, yet throws away all logic by enhancing exaggerated situations that will never happen. The settings of this story is quite global. The traveling is situated from the Vatican City to Yellowstone Park, to Washington D.C. and much, much more. The timing for release took place way too late in the year. It was supposed to be a summer movie but it came out in November. Makes you wonder, did Columbia Pictures deliberately stalled the release because it did not appeal to the summer crowd. Makes you wonder don't it? I expected the thrills of the movie and I knew what I was getting into. And If you are passive with some mundane dialogue along the way, then it is still worthy for a view or two. But if you go in thinking this will happen in the next couple of years, then you might as well believe in Santa Claus.",6,0,1,26 July 2010
I Am Legend," The Definitive Sounds of Silence
","All those harsh critics will like condemn 'I Am Legend' as being a cheap remake of 'Robinson Crusoe' and the 2000 movie 'Castaway' starring Tom Hanks. When in reality, 'I Am Lengend' is actually a tribute to the classic movie from 1971 titled 'The Omega Man' starring Charlton Heston about a deadly virus that wipes out the human population. After watching this movie again, I found it to be very out-dated by today's standards, therefore this remake seems more up to par with today's modern world and will likely have an impact with today's generation. The way a remake should be done is modeled by the more recent 'Dawn of the Dead' compared to its predecessor. The original version of 'Dawn of the Dead' was lagging in pace, but touched upon many issues. Whereas, the remake was equally riveting because it was a whole different ball game overall filled with more original idea compared to the original. 'I Am Legend' succeeds in that path as well, by creating new ideas and a different concept to the story. Like in 'The Omega Man', 'I Am Legend' has a fraction of the people passive from the virus and others morph into mutants. Unlike 'The Omega Man' where the mutants are intellectual and function well in society, 'I Am Legend' takes a 360 degree turn by making the mutants as a homage to the old classic zombie movies as being scary and dumb.Another major key element to the success of 'I Am Legend' is the wonderful performance of Will Smith. Usually I'm used to seeing him perform in a fast paced manner, here he's taking his performance in strides. And acting by himself in most of the movie can be very complex. Just ask Tom Hanks in 'Castaway' and the only things that are surrounding you are a CGI mutants and a dog. Director Francis Lawrence deserves plenty of kudos for creating a dark and brooding image which creates the lonely isolated atmosphere that was brought to life here. And without the sounds of music in the background, the quietness in the background is rather effective. Then when the zombies come out to play, is when the sounds of silence is broken. The narration is brilliantly nuanced in its entirety. Sure it would've been a standard zombie movie with the population wipe-out, the zombie takeover and a eclectic final climax. But Lawrence decides to take that pivotal one step ahead of the game by uncovering the wipe-out in a series of flashbacks throughout the movie. Also the little observations should be carefully noticed (i.e. the gas prices). The little things are what makes this movie real. For a disease prone people transforming into zombie flick, there is actually very moderate violence. My only complaint is that the zombies in 'The Omega Man' are coherent and seem to know where the leading character lives and knows his every move. In 'I Am Legend', the zombies seem retarded and Robert Neville (Smith) can easily hide from those incoherent mutants. Perhaps it was done deliberately by Lawrence so he wouldn't be accused of plagiarism. But it scores high points in originality and it also works effectively by starting so fresh it doesn't feel like its a remake.",9,1,2,9 March 2009
Gran Torino," Eastwood Shows That He Can Still Play Tough At 79
","Clint Eastwood shows no signs of slowing as he tirelessly puts out another scintillating cinematic masterpiece that is 'Gran Torino'. This movie focuses on gangs and it's up to our main protagonist (Eastwood) to put an end to their rampage. With violence being the centre of attention, it is executed in a patriotic fashion that has been performed by Americans and approved by their audience. It also concentrates on the benefits of friendship in a way that doesn't manipulate you into too much temptation where we encounter a climatic final showdown. The heroism is not designed to inflate one's ego, but handled in a very intellectual demeanour. There are times when Eastwood gets carried away with his heroic position to the point he ends up looking like Christ, especially in the final scene. In some ways I thought it was one of the more flawed scenes in the movie. I don't find his character to stand synonymous with the Catholic teachings and to be portrayed in such a light-hearted casual fashion. The character's heart-wrenching sacrifice is believable, the gesture itself is handled Biblicly where someone takes something of his/her own to save the life of another human will eternally be magical, no matter how many millions of times it has been executed in movies.Another small qualm is that some actors are less effective than others. It's like they're either trying to hard to keep up and others aren't trying at all.Christopher Carley who played the priest is absolutely abysmal. Bee Vang as Thao, needs to enrol in an actors program. However, Ahney Her was absolutely stunning and impressive as the Thao's intelligent and level-headed sister. When she becomes harassed by the street gangs surrounding the area, we anxiously await for Dirty Harry's longly-needed comeback to come armed and take down these mindless parasites a taste of their blood. As much as awards are rigged, I think Miss Her should have deserved an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, because she was the best character in the movie, even usurping Eastwood's Walt Kowalski. For the past two decades, Eastwood has created some very remarkable films. 'Bird' was a definitive masterpiece, 'Unforgiven' had enough blood for all those who love a little blood and gore. 'Mystic River' just oozes with beauty. 'Million Dollar Baby' gave strong performances by the cast (especially Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman), but the direction was not one of Eastwood's best. 'Gran Torino' should have gotten more credit than it has deserved and even though Eastwood is not as young as was (no one is for that matter) he can still pack a punch at 79 years old.",8,1,5,21 December 2009
The Hurt Locker," Soldiers Shouldn't Be That Offended
","Those who have experienced the terrors of the War in Iraq and Afghanistan will be greatly offended by the unrealistic scenarios depicted in 'The Hurt Locker'. As much as I respect the torture and torment they had endured overseas, I think they took this movie way too seriously by saying it's unrealistic and inaccurate and I have to disagree with them to some degree. The anti-war sentiments depicted in this movie is exhibited in a delicate matter. For example taken from the quote by journalist Chris Hedges where he mentions that the desire for fighting is very competitive and addictive, thus in his words 'war is a drug.' In a way his words prove a point being that near the end of the movie when Sgt. William James goes back to the warzone in Iraq, because of his restlessness of settling down in his American home with civilians who don't know jack of what's going on in that area. From watching documentary's and newsreels, only handful return to the Middle East due to this self-proclaimed needy obsession. The go back for the goodness of their people, the adrenaline rush and the salaries they make. Granted it's nowhere close to perfect and that it shouldn't have been nominated for an Oscar (let alone Best Director for Katheryn Bigelow), the actors were dressed and destined to act like seasoned veterans, but instead they ended up performing implausible and dumbfounded tasks that soldiers would never have been permitted to do. Who in their right mind would attempt to achieve something deadly with nobody at their side? I mean come on, I may have never fought in combat, but trying to be a one-man hero in deadly situations is just foolhardy to put it bluntly. It's a bit of hyperbole to just completely condemn the movie by observing the flaws and faux pas (which come in abundance), but it's not a complete fallacy compared to this self-described 'hidden enemy' they like to talk about, and the use of weapons too (IED's). Split-second strategies are a common trend in the Middle East, and it all strings in the matter of life, death or imprisonment for friends and enemies alike. Suicide bombs for children and casual civilian-shield targeting happened there and that's just the icing on the cake. Terrorists have an unorthodox way to define their moral values. For a more accurate viewing of soldiers at war, 'Generation Kill' is the one to watch. But still, the heart and the effort in making 'The Hurt Locker' should be praised.",6,0,2,14 June 2010
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Sticks Close to The Novel Most of the Time
","Okay, after reading the 'Twilight Sagas', I came the theaters last year expecting the outcome and I didn't care very much if they didn't feature everything that the book contained. But when you think about it, Stephen King adaptations don't incorporate every scene in his novels or J.K. Rowlings' Harry Potter adaptations for that matter. It's not really necessary to nitpick every detail from the book and classify it as a terrible movie. You just have to take it for what it's worth, a movie that will keep you on your seat for the next two hours so enjoy the movie first, then draw your own conclusions later.'New Moon' wasn't the best story of the saga, but it wasn't the lowest of the lot. The rivalry between Edward (Robert Pattinson) and Jacob (Taylor Lautner) over the love for Bella (Kristen Stewart) brings a closer bonding between the two. That's how see 'New Moon' a way that segues into the rather mundane sequel 'Eclipse'.Storywise, 'New Moon' follows the novel quite accurately. Granted some scenes were neglected which will not sit well for die-hard 'Twilight' fanatics, but the scenes omitted were not very important. There were plenty of dramatic scenarios, and the slow-motion scenes give it that full effect even where Bella was running through a water fountain. The acting was kind of weak in some areas. Overall, Stewart and Pattinson played out their respected roles that were given to them, and even turned their performances have improved a bit higher here than in the previous Twilight movie. There was no act of absurdity this time around between the two and the chemistry seems more relaxed as they seem more at ease in their roles this time around. But Taylor Lautner as Jacob, well that's another story. I guess his more airtime this time around may have overwhelmed him a bit. The over-drama element in the story was the cause of his letdown. I guess he was just on for the ladies to drool on so he can show off his shirtless body which is featured in most of his scenes. Dakota Fanning who wasn't on for a long period of time, out-acted Lautner. In the acting, Lautner was the Achilles heel.The visuals in this movie was a staggering improvement than the previous Twilight. It shows that the budget has gotten bigger thanks to that ballistic fan base it has gotten over the years. Edward's skin didn't glitter as much when exposed to light, and we see what gives the vampire Cullen family a fist glance at how they operate. The wolves were pretty cool. Still very CGI, but since they couldn't use real wolves, CGI will have to do. The change from wolf to human looked a little rushed and no need for him strip every time he transforms, but I won't lose any sleep from this.In general, this sequel was ten times better than the original 'Twilight'. Sure it's over two hours long, but never once did it wears out his welcome. It was slow at the beginning, but gradually, the pace began to pick up, it just had to clear a few things out of the way. The acting was pretty good. Lautner needs more acting skills and to ease off on the body exposure. There was something that totally irked me, which may not be important to others. But three parts of the of the credits were edited out. I'm not trying to be on the anti-Lautner bandwagon, I'm sure with more roles in the future he might get better through time, like a fine wine. I'm not on Edward's side or Jacob's side. I'm going to play it in the middle and root for Bella all the way. This is the best of the series. I hope you all enjoyed it.",8,2,7,23 August 2010
The Illusionist," Creative Exhibition Of Wonderful Story Telling
","Based on the short story by Steven Milhauser, 'Eisenheim The Illusionist' set in the Austrian-Hungarian Empire in the 19th century tells the tale about the son of a working-class carpenter who specializes in cabinets falls smitten for an upper-class Viennese lady but is not permitted to go anywhere near her due to the discrimination torn between their social standings. The story leads the young man to a professional magician who reveals his crafty illusions as he explores mystifying lands that further enhances his knowledge towards the mysteries of life. Upon his return to Vienna, where the now confident commoner begins to perform his magic act, not just towards the plebeian spectators, but also towards the upper echelons of social class including his majesty the crowned Prince Rudolf, the son of Emperor Franz Josef who ruled the Austrian-Hungarian Empire.The original premise of the story was intended to have been an exploitation aimed towards the monarchy, in which a gruesome incident happened where at a hunting lodge, the bodies of Prince Rudolf and his girlfriend the Baroness Mary Vetsera were found and the scandal was handled in low prolific matter for a number of years by the Royal family as a ploy to save their reputation.Edward Norton was excellent as the titular character and what's the real treat about Norton's performance is that many of the magic were actually performed the talented thespian. It must've taken him an overwhelming amount of time before he was able to perfect his magical skills. When the credits rolled, it had I wondering if these acts of trickery were just optical illusions or did Eisenheim possessed something more mystical than one could imagine.The effects were just as equally magical as the tricks Eisenheim was performing. One of the best tricks in the movie unquestionably would have to be the Excalibur Sword trick where the talented magician takes Rudolf's sword and the sword is pointed erect and is somehow magnetically attached to the stage. Eisenheim asks the patricians to release the sword from the stage, unfortunately to no avail, they failed to do so (an unfortunate homage to the King Arthur story). However, Prince Rudolf manages pull the sword from its position even through a flawed effort, which causes a bit of humiliation on the part of the Prince who now declares Eisenheim an enemy amongst the aristocracy.Paul Giamatti does another incredible performance as the untrustworthy Inspector Uhl. Giamatti is such an incredibly talented performer, able to play unique and versatile roles in comedy, tragedy, drama and thrillers.The atmosphere was very original and blends in beautifully with the time period. It felt like the audience was living in that time period. It gave me the impression that the director Neil Burger used editing techniques that were dated over 80 years ago which is a bit unorthodox for such a film that is strong in fantasy, brilliant in supernatural effects and a romance story equally effective as any Shakespeare story. The ending of the story was executed to near perfection which exemplifies that excellent storytelling is played from the heart. This is a tale not to miss.",9,2,3,19 March 2012
Transformers," Better Than I Expected
","When I came into the theaters to see 'Transformers' two years ago, I didn't expect much. In fact I was turned off from the trailers at the physical appearance of the robots and I was thinking, oh great another shoddy remake based on my childhood memories, lowered down by Hollywood and its cheesy remakes. However after the movie was over, I had to eat my words. In the end I found the film to swift pass all that I expected. A loyal hats off to director Michael Bay for bringing this action thriller to life. In it's two hour and twenty duration, it was never once dull and the action is nonstop, just like the cartoon series from the 1980's. The backgrounds were beautifully nuanced and the human actors had a chance to shine and were not usurped by the giant robots. What adds to the atmosphere is that this action film has a very unique origin to it, the way a debut should always commence. The introduction wasn't rushed like in many action flicks as it provided enough depth to make is easier to follow and it flows through nicely. Even those who never heard or even watched transformers will be able to understand the story of their origins and how the war between the good Transformers vs. the evil Decepticons came about.The robots come off physically different and their characteristics light up the screen as each of them were highlighted splendidly. The CGI is at its very best here. Before anyone starts to quip about 'Transformers', try to take time to realize that there are so many versions of Transformers featured on television for many years, with each one holding a different perspective to the franchise. I suggest you watch each of the series' pilot episode and you can clearly understand that they are all different from each other. This movie is another new series only this time it's transferred from the set to the screen.Don't be judgmental and just randomly put it down by saying it's stupid and not real. It's a sci-fi action thriller, it's not meant to be real. I would like to add this to my collection of movies as it's finally graced the screen to hopefully enlighten a new generation of fans today as to what it accomplished in the 1980's.",9,1,3,16 March 2009
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Scary But Well-Cultured In Details
","'Good Night and Good Luck' is an uplifting confrontation between longtime news journalist Edward Murrow and the infamous Wisconsin Senator Joseph McCarthy who once accused Mr Murrow of being a Communist in 1950's America. The script was penned by George Clooney which is apropos since Clooney was a journalism student in University and was co-written by Grant Heslov. The movie provides a plethora of archives that would make this movie almost documentary like rather than a political drama. In addition to that, Clooney also directed and performed here as well. The movie begins with Murrow (David Strathairn) being honoured at a dinner ceremony, which then quickly shifts gears to a heated battle with Senator McCarthy. Murrow defends himself with a CBS executive based on a news story about an Air Force officer being dishonourably discharged after McCarthy claimed he was secret spy. And from there the heat takes off from there. There are tow other worthy subplots one that involves the marriage of two CBS employees and a news anchorman on the brink of suicide.There is no doubt that George Clooney is one of the best performers in the world today. He's come a long way from the 80's sitcom 'The Fact of Life' to the hospital drama 'ER' to the big screen. Edward R. Murrow was an iconic journalist in his time and became a public figure back in World War II when he was doing broadcasts in London during the air raids.The movie itself is a gripping and and upbeat political drama that leaves no stone unturned. And sure we never look into Mr. Murrow's personal life, but the black-and-white images have that certain nostalgic look of what and how the news was covered in the fifties. I was expecting something a little more satirical almost to the point of being like a farce. Boy was I wrong! But I digress, this movie was serious in delivery and everything looked and felt authentic. The stories and coverage being shown felt like I was on a class. The release done in black-and-white was symbolic and yet very scintillating. Even the cigarette smoking tolerance was pretty much in the 1950's.If I was to pinpoint a weakness to 'Good Night and Good Luck', it would have to be that it was way too short and a lot of coverage was still underdeveloped. The Red Scare fiasco could have been more further explained and more of the fear and paranoia that materialized towards the civilians during the 1950's. McCarthy didn't intentionally wanted fear and doubt on America, but he surely relished it like a conductor holding his baton.This is a good film for those who are studying journalism or pursuing goals in journalism and too see the physical and metaphorical black and white of journalism in the 1950's. The script by Clooney and Heslov was truly a masterpiece that truly earned its Oscar nominations, including Best Picture. Historians will love the film for its accuracy and how television news that was in its infancy operated. The dramatic and excellent dialogue make this film all the more poignant.",9,3,5,25 February 2013
8 Mile," Shows That Rappers Can Act
","The first time I heard of the rapper Eminem, was in the year 2000 when I listened to the song, 'The Real Slim Shady'. At first I thought the voice was really awkward. Can some really have that much of a nasal voice?But the legend that is Eminem lives on. I had my doubts about seeing his movie debut in the 2002, titled '8 Mile' because over the course of history, various hip-hop and rap artists tried to expand their horizons and try out their acting chops to prove that they are not one-trick ponies. But over the course of time, each performer had failed. But after getting a mixed reception from the critics, I decided to see the movie myself and be the judge if this movie was good or if it was pure dog poop. In my opinion, '8 Mile' is good enough to purchase on DVD and for if you can't decipher hip-hip lingo, I would strongly advise you to caption the English subtitles to get a better understanding of the words being said. The film itself succeeds in keeping it real, plus everything looks authentic and never once does it feel forced or even contrived. I think it deserves to be seen many times and to me this movie holds a special place in my heart. Director Curtis Hanson has made many iconic films like 'L.A. Confidential' and 'Wonder Boys'. Here in '8 Mile' he gives it everything he's got and not once does the movie feel like a letdown. The main man that holds this film together is Eminem. His role as Jimmy 'Rabbit' Smith Jr. is the definitive anti-hero. He's got a bit of a mean streak in him and seems to have the neurotic pleasures in talking trash and picking fights with people, only to lose most of them. His romantic scene with Alex (Brittany Murphy) was only on briefly while he was a working at an auto plant in the heart of Detroit (cliche). If you think this movie will have the predictable, formulaic conclusion where everything comes up roses for Rabbit, you are all out on a limb. Eminem is not the only one carrying the weight here, the supporting cast is also equally poignant. One of the more notable supporters include Mekhi Phifer who plays the part as Future, who comes across as Rabbit's mentor and sort of a father-figure to Rabbit. Evan Jones is very likable as Cheddar Bob,a crew member who's funny, even though he's not the sharpest knife in the drawer. But the real scene stealing comes from the decrepit city of Detroit itself. The landscapes depicted here showcase some of the bleakest ever put on celluloid. It's been said that this movie was shot at the infamous 313 so I'm heard. On DVD the extras are not very impressive. For one thing, the 'making of' features are not anything worthwhile because they're on for only 10 minutes and very little contribution is delivered by Eminem. I was however, impressed by the soundtrack listings where you can go over to the scene where each song is featured. In that is in sync to the free style rap battles that happens in this movie. The behind the scenes look at the freestyle battles that occur in '8 Mile' are quite stunning. It has a bit of an 'American Idol' like atmosphere as four extras try to duke it out with the 'King of Rap' himself Eminem. What makes this feature poignant is that this scene never made the final cut. This addition in the DVD holds it's merits as we see first and forehand just how dynamic and witty Eminem really is and he is the 'King of Rap'.",8,1,2,12 October 2014
Rudy," The Gridiron Never Looked Classier
","You may not necessarily have to be a football fan to like this movie, but 'Rudy' stands the test of time as one of the best football movie ever put on celluloid. It goes beyond what 'Paper Lion' tried to achieve in the 1960's but this one steps the ante by a mile to provide you with the quest for one's quest to be the best that he could be and to have a role model any underdog can look upon to. Daniel 'Rudy' Ruettiger always has aspirations to play for the Notre Dame Flaming Irish. His dreams were put on hold when his friend suddenly dies, Rudy is determined more than ever to play for Notre Dame much to the dismay of his wife (Lili Taylor) and is dad (Ned Beatty). Sure it's not really a football film as we are witnessed to just one game and aside from a scene in the early-goings there are no football scenes until the latter portions of the movie. The acting truly defines brilliance. Sean Astin was very stunning in his role as Rudy, his performance will make you reach out for the tissue box, but there are moments where he adds some humor to his performance. Along with his early childhood role in 'The Goonies' and later on as Sam from 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy, Astin has put on a resume that spans over 25 years in the movie industry. It's a shame he's been overlooked over the years, by lesser talents like Corey Feldman and Haley Joel Osement. This guy has showcased he has charm and talent which goes together like fish and chips. Charles Dutton provides a stimulating performance as the gruff but kindhearted groundskeeper. Dutton prevents his role from being a throwback role by making it a pivotal supporting role. The musical score is something to get the party going. Sure it gets repetitive at times, it succeeds in keeping the spirit of this film alive. Sure it can be overlooked by other classic sports movies like 'Rocky' or 'Raging Bull', but 'Rudy' is right up there with the big guns. What makes this movie a standout is the wonderful acting, the never give up message behind it the story and a character you could cheer for the whole way through.",9,0,1,15 November 2010
Logan," A Nice Send-Off To Hugh Jackman's Role That Solidified His Career
","Emanating in the year 2029, the mutant race is on the brink of non-existence. An aging, disheveled shell of his former self, Logan (Hugh Jackman) the once mighty brave leader of the X-Men s now living a secluded lifestyle working as a chauffeur in a dystopian junkyard desert in Mexico with his ailing mentor Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and his loyal, pale complexioned tracker Caliban (Stephen Merchant). Trouble starts brewing as Logan against his better judgement must protect mutant girl named Laura (Dafne Keen) from an assembly of bounty hunter in pursuit to wipe them out led by Donald Pierce. (Boyd Holbrook). Since 2000, Hugh Jackman has played the iconic Logan/Wolverine ad it's this role alone that definitively put a stamp on his career. After 17 years, this ride mut come to an end and in 'Logan', Jackman will unleash the dreaded claws for one more hurrah. The big difference between this movie and the previous solo films about Wolverine is that the action is more tense, the drama is more uplifting and the action scene are violent, but very well choreographed. The best thing about this movie is that director James Mangold give superhero action fans what they want add to that what they deserve, an R-rated film that shows no remorse or any watering down in its action scenes. Through all that dicing and slicing with his claws Jackman looks like he's never lost his step. Aside from the gory scenes, Mangold and his screenwriting cohorts Scott Frank and Michael Green have successfully managed to fully bring Mark Millar and Scott McNiven's 'Old Man Logan' comic series juxtaposed with an homage to the classic Westerns like 1953's 'Shane' and 1992's 'Unforgiven'. The character of Logan himself has an identical psyche to Alan Ladd's Shane and Clint Eastwood's William Munny as a vigilante who's willing to leave the past behind him and unwinds until something horrifying happens that resurrects his old habits. In spite of the gloom settings and cynical tones, there is an equally balanced humour to lift one's spirits so that you won't leave the theatre depressed. Performance wise, Jackman delivers a strong performance as Logan being that it is his swan song as the film that made him who he is gives everything he can to close out this chapter in his movie career. Patrick Stewart is remarkable as Professor Charles Xavier and though it can be sad seeing this once powerful mentor in the aging condition he's in, Stewart still pulls it off convincingly. Wonderful performances come from the strong support from Stephen Merchant and Boyd Holbrook as Caliban and Donald Pierce respectively. The real scene stealing comes from Dafne Keen as mutant Laura who was near flawless. If I could find a solitary flaw in this story it have to be the editing. The main scene which could've been better was when the mutants are hiding in a remote area. When everything sums up we should not say this is the end, we should just say, see you later. Even though Jackman may not play Wolverine, there might be another performer who might play Wolverine. Though this may be the end of an era for Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, at least he went down in a big way thanks to his endearing performance and Mangold's sharp direction. This will truly be a send-off everyone will remember.",9,1,3,30 January 2018
The Dark Knight," A Good Adventure But Falls Back on Greatness
","The main highlights of this dismal, dark isolated atmospheric superhero adventure movie is the Joker's (Heath Ledger) appearances the climactic special effects like the explosions and the believable dark clouds that surround this dreary, but riveting blockbuster. According to demographics, the majority of the audience who went to see 'The Dark Knight' are 85% males between 18-35 who's minds are fixated on video games. And that is a non-surprising statistic.With the exception of Ledger's stunning performance, this movie fails to carry out its promise in gathering our interest in watching the good usurp the forces of evil, almost to the point where we take more sympathy for the evil Joker than the dark hero himself, Batman(Christian Bale).Bruce Wayne comes on to me as philandering playboy and his portrayal is thinner than a Ritz cracker. His envy and rage over the new female D.A. Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is more juvenile in personality without any sign of emotion at all. Even when they embrace in that fatal kiss, it's more manipulative than inspiring. Batman's robotic voice and stoic expressions convinces the audience into thinking, is that a man or a cyborg? This pedestrian performance may give the audience the impression that this movie was never meant for adults to watch. The anger and rage manifested in the Joker's soul has some spark of appeal and sorrow, but the schtick eventually become monotonous after a while that it becomes tiring after a while. The final scenes in the movie has very little excitement that afterwords people started to slowly trickle out of the cinema disappointed because of the set-up. It was just pure banal.Though it's not the worst movie in the world, it's still very over-rated in the end. The real standout was the Clown Prince of Evil himself the Joker. But even he couldn't save this movie himself. He wasn't getting any real help from his co-stars. But if you are those who just want to watch the movies just to see Heath Ledger one last time? Well the more power to you, but you really shouldn't do that on account of someone's unfortunate premature death.",6,12,23,16 June 2009
Pride & Prejudice," Nothing But Low Expectations In This Adaptation
","Seven years ago when I went to see this 2005 adaptation of Jane Austen's classic novel 'Pride and Prejudice', I was having my doubts that it would not measure up the five hour A&E version. But for the record I went to go see it anyway knowing that most of the cast are high prolific actors and actresses I was hoping they would make the most of their performances. Sad to say, though not at fault to the performances, this adaptation failed in many certain levels that others (especially the 1995 adaptation which was the best) have succeeded.So where did this movie go wrong? It was mainly due to the characters in this adaptation. For starters the Bennet family came upon as untidy and destitute From Austen's novel, the Bennet family gave me the impression that they were not meant to appear like the way they did in this adaptation. Sure maybe they didn't were not meant to look noble, but Bennet's appearance tends to look just bit better than the orphan boys from 'Oliver Twist'.Mr. Bennet is badly portrayed as a cantankerous geriatric. One of the primary reasons that 'Pride and Prejudice is excellent was that Miss Austen utilized plenty of good humour and most of the funny lines came from Mr. Bennet. In this version all that subliminal humour never materialized and had really and there was really no reason for that. Granted he did start to lighten up at the end and had a hilarious line regarding any beaus that may call for Kitty and Mary. Pure classic! At the early stages of the movie, Lizzy struck me for a stuck up and had no real reason for detesting Mr. Darcy for the first time she ever laid eyes on her. That really didn't sit very well with me. She continually released utter disdain for him even before he lashed out his critical low opinion of her. She truly turned me off from her negative attitude and it became difficult for me to sit through the whole movie. Call me biased, but I really don't like people who have negative energy they carry within them.Mr. Bingley came upon me as a foolish bumbler instead of a modest but lovable individual And to me the the actress who played Jane (Rosamund Pike) should have played Elizabeth rather than the overrated Keira Knightley. Jane was a more up it to character in terms of wit and better delivery and focus to her character than Elizabeth. Kitty and Lydia and even Lizzy herself had the awful tendency to giggle with no apparent reason. Aside from that I found them annoying and unlikable just the same. It was also shameful that they changed the character of Georgiana Darcy. The book gives the impression that she's quite introverted as to appear aloof but that's not the case here. Georgiana was anything but an introvert.As the sun settles I kind of like the turnout in the end, but it still never shined on me and I would not recommend it to anyone Would I have appreciated it better had I not read the book? I think it would have been better if the story would have shaped up the romantic subplot between Elizabeth and Darcy and added more depth to the other characters.I'm prepared to get condemned for my overall rant of this adaptation since other reviewers negatively, but in all honesty, I just found it quite difficult to like this movie. The A&E version is much better. But that's my opinion, if others wish to contradict me, please do. Just don't be too harsh.",5,2,4,19 November 2012
Invictus," Solid Drama That Weaves on The Topics of Politics and Sports
","Even though he's coming on in age, Clint Eastwood can still dazzle his audience, even when he's behind the camera. For a grizzled veteran, he still manages to come up with good quality pictures, even if not all of them are entirely great. The last really good cinematic masterpiece he truly made before 'Invictus' was 'Million Dollar Baby'. He does have a tendency of over-casting non-performers in his movies like he did in 'Gran Torino', even though his intentions were good. But nobody can deny that Eastwood is master in his craft and the productions of his film are taken through heart even if they're not always electrifying. 'Invictus' is a very well-made movie based on a true story with touchy subjects and issues that will have you pondering for hours to come. In 1994 three years after South African political activist Nelson Mandela gets released from prison after spending three decades there, he is now the new president of South Africa and his quest to bring unity between the races with the country. When an all Caucasian rugby team who's been struggling for a championship, Mandela decides to step up and fix the team to becoming the best they can be and to erase the divinity within the races in the country. Morgan Freeman was the perfect casting choice as Mandela. He decides that the South African team the Springboks have potential to be championship material and there he meets up with the captain of the rugby team Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon)and felt his first quest was to inject unification among the Springboks as a symbolical way so that the country can have a team to be proud of and the pivotal step to expunge apartheid forever. So we see kind of a two-plot story behind the movie, Invictus'. One we have Mandela adjusting his new role as the leader of his country as he's faced with plenty of turmoil that includes outrage, uproarious fear and racism. One pivotal scene was when his all-black security staff was being questioned by the Secret Service guys and later accepted. The other plot is Pienaar's initiative to encourage his rugby team to a winning season while taking part in the activities emanating in the country and trying to come to terms of a nation that's under a political unrest at the time. In one memorable scene Pienaar and his team visit the jail that where Mandela was incarcerated and enter his cell. It was a very subtle moment where the drama in this movie is the most important. The two plots climatically join together as Mandela is seated to see this emotional and very important World Cup of the 1995 Rugby Championships. This final game will not just keep the sports fans enthralled, but the setup is structured beautifully. Eastwood went out of his way to create a country that at the time was struggling with politics and race issues and makes you feel for the people involved in the movie and the World Cup final match is an added bonus to the intriguing scenes depicted in the movie. Though it's a great movie, there are still flaws as well. Unless you know the rules of rugby which a lot of people may not be familiar with (nothing personal) you might be lost in the rules and the way the game is operated. But it wasn't a huge drawback for me, I just wanted to see some good sports. Also there's this rather weird scene in the movie that's supposedly happened in real life, but Eastwood directs it like he's manipulating us into making it feel like a political thriller when it really isn't. But those burps won't spoil my liking for this movie. Even though it's not a perfect film, 'Invictus' is still provocative and entertaining and raises a lot of questions and if a movie can generate food for thought, it ranks high in my grading system. It truly has something for those who are enthused by political dramas plus it has something to offer for those who love sports enthusiasts.",8,0,1,13 June 2016
Mission: Impossible," More To Like About This Movie Aside From The Obvious
","I can never quite figure out what makes 'Mission Impossible' such a film that attracts me like it does. From the other viewers out there, the scenes that they're pining over the most include the break-in at the CIA headquarters and the chase scene at the Chunnel. These fans think that those two scenes are the reasons for seeing this movie. And though they are correct in that perspective that they are memorable scenes, but that's not the only reasons why I like 'Mission Impossible'. In fact there are far more better reasons why I like this movie a lot. Why do I enjoy this movie so much you may ask? Well for starters let's start with the leading character Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise). Unlike James Bond, Hunt refrains from being a spontaneous trigger-happy spy, who boozes on martini's and sleeps around with any female cohort who aligns with him. In this movie, he only handles a gun just one time, but never opens fire with it. It's a shame that John Woo who took over as a direction after this one had to go in that direction in the sequel. The top dog in the Impossible Mission Force (IMF) Ethan's fight plans are smart and methodical rather than casual and slick. He doesn't just randomly kills people one by one. Another characteristic I found so attached to Ethan Hunt was his decency towards female co-workers like Claire Phelps (Emmanuelle Beart) who goes as far as respects the fact that she is a married lady who happens to be married to his boss Jim Phelps (Jon Voight). In fact this spy movie doesn't have any sexual activity provided in this movie which makes it all the more refreshing. And these idiosyncrasies plus the precarious situation he's been put in, Ethan Hunt succeeds in being a relatively likable character. I'm only just observing the heart of the movie.Many people have blasted this film for being overbearingly convoluted, but that's a misnomer. If you have meagre attention spans, you may not like a film of this magnitude or those who were expecting a plethora of exciting flashy thrills or action effects. The film's intentions are for us as a viewer to be involved with the character/s and follow through within each scene. All the scenes, set-pieces and props all flow in a very immaculate perspective. Being antsy to watch something wow will likely never happen here. You feel like part of the action with Ethan and when things start to unfold, you'll react just like the way Ethan does.What were my favourite scenes in 'Mission Impossible'? Well as much as I agree with the Chunnel chase as being very exciting, I thought the best scenes were his interactions with Phelps in the final scenes. 'It was Kittredge'. Phelps was so convincing, and we all know Ethan knows that's far from the truth. We see him summarizing all the events from the Prague mission in his mind. It's not that easy to contradict someone like Phelps because he's Ethan's superior. Then he asks this esoteric question, 'Why..Jim Why'? Which translates to 'Why would Kittridge do it, when really the question is why would YOU do it?'It's the more deeper content of 'Mission Impossible' that make this movie all the more special. This movie is not the 'all style and no substance' that most viewers have complained about. But to hell with them, I won't let them deprive me from enjoying it. Even after 20 years, this movie never gets old. If anyone wishes to disagree with me feel free, but your opinions will not change my opinion about this movie.",9,1,1,13 December 2015
The Last Samurai," Works Well On A Lot Of Levels
","Odd as it may seem, but 'The Last Samurai' never quite had that much of an impact on me. Which seems unorthodox because I happen to enjoy samurai films. Not only that, but I've been a fan of movies that were directed by Edward Zwick (especially 'Glory'). And Ken Watanabe comes to the table fully prepared in whatever role he plays. So the least I could was give this movie at least a try. The story begins during the American Civil War as eternally inebriated war veteran Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) has his life twisted in an indecipherable knot. When he's not gulping down the sauce, the unforgettable traumas come back to haunt him as he can't forgive himself over the murders of several Native Americans. Col. Bagley (Tony Goldwyn) assigns Algren to Japan and guide their army with more advanced military weapons like rifles, muskets and cannons to their advantage. Only doing if for the good pay that comes with it, Algren agrees to it and as way to expunge his troubled past behind him. Much in the same route as 'Dances With Wolves', Algren is leading a very inexperienced army against a very well-trained group of samurai warriors led by the oracular Katsumoto (Watanabe). Algren's army is defected and Algren is captured. During his abduction, Algren starts to progressively bond with the knowledgeable but understanding Katsumoto as each start to learn more about the purposes of war and what it means to each of them. As time progresses, Algren starts to feel a more spiritual vibe about the samurai way of life and the not so glamorous depiction of war by the Japanese Emperor and what his modernized fighters represent. The events eventually transpires to an all-out climactic battle and who in the end comes out on top. So what was it that stood out like sore thumb about this movie? It must be the fact that Tom Cruise doesn't look like he's cut out for a period piece film. He tries to fit in, but he can't really quite grip in breaking away from the fact he's living in the 1860's and not 2003. His acting is very well executed he just lacks that connection that catches him off guard and that can be a problem when the audience feels it too. Fortunately everything else seems to work out very well. The production values are quite spot on, the locality of this film was top of the line and the costumes and the props give you that feeling that you've returned to the Meiji period in Japan. For a movie just shy of three hours long, Zwick succeeds in keeping the narrative sharp and the editing well packaged and the dialogue the freedom to go at its own pace. The audience also gets to observe what samurai life is like and the predicament that Algren finds himself. This can be done thank to some brilliant photography by John Toll and an excellent score by Hans Zimmer, we know this film is not playing with kid's gloves. The action really keeps the pace go by very quickly and it really flies by that you never once have to look at your watch a single second. Sure those who've studied Japanese history or culture will find a major hole in the plot. It seems that the samurai culture is unapologetic in glorification. It seems the feudal samurai people were dominate over the peasants. What they failed to understand was that the Japanese Emperor was catering modern warfare to all the people of Japan and not just the more wealthy samurai. Some of these civilians see this as an advantage and those who rebelled missed what the intentions were and feared they'll lose what power they've been holding. Overall this is very well made film, however it lack in some areas where it loses some of the more effective ways it could have been. If given the right performer would've made a big difference.",8,1,1,25 April 2016
Life Is Beautiful," Shows a Lighter Edge To A Tragic Event In History
","I never thought the day would come when a movie centred during the Holocaust would be provided with humour. The Holocaust was anything but funny then and now as thousands of Europeans of Jewish faith were killed off mainly towards fear, paranoia, economical insecurity and just plain hatred. But once in a while towards sadness, we can open our hearts and try to survive the grimness with some humour to raise our spirit. And that is exactly what actor/director/writer Roberto Benigni succeeds in 'Life is Beautiful'. It's a refreshing break from the graphic and and disturbing images that has haunted the theatres past and present like Spielberg's 'Schildler's List' or Polanski's 'The Pianist' as we look to a more brighter side of the Holocaust mainly toward the humour of the leading protagonist, Guido Orefice (Benigni).When it first came out and it was listed as a comedy, I thought it was just too surreal to be true. I mean nothing funny ever happened in the Holocaust. And film adaptations have been quite demonstrative at that. In those troubled times, lives were lost, families were separated, people were cold, starving fear and doubt was on the minds of Europeans Jewish and non-Jewish. at the time. But Benigni showed his mastery in front and behind the camera that we can enjoy the goodness of life, even in times of uncertainty because we only live once and we must enjoy it while we can.Benigni was not the only person who made this film all the more worthwhile. Nicoletta Braschi turns in a wonderful performance as a Catholic girl who loves her husband regardless of what religion he practises. A grand portion of scenes demonstrates just how pointless racism is and the best example is set in the schoolroom scene.Concentration camps are one of the worst establishments anyone would ever dream of entering and yet in this movie we can enjoy a chuckle. In one scene, Guido persuades the soldiers as he defends his son as a ploy to prevent his son from further dire circumstances. While we laugh as he tries to weasel his way out from further punishment, we are still aware and concerned about the welfare of Guido and his young son and the dangers they are encountering.The fearful and depressing effects of the Holocaust is exhibited in brief moments of sad truths that weave into Guido's detailed fantasies. But you never see him fall victim to disparity. His wild imagination and his determination are the only weapons of protection he utilizes to keep his family and his son in tact. The remarkable story of love and tenderness is worthy enough for everyone to see. This movie should be cherished for a long time to come.",9,11,19,28 January 2013
Woman in Gold," Lots of Things Covered But Works Effectively
","'Woman in Gold' is a mixture of courtroom drama and a tale of Holocaust survival,but an intriguing journey of etching through the trenches of WWII and an odd couple seeking justice starring Helen Mirren and Ryan Reynolds.After the war ended, it was time for people to settle in and restore the heartbreak and injustices that took place in the six years that caused trauma, tragedy lost loved ones and to rebuild a new life for the citizens who survived and the next generation to come. Even though a lot has been forgiven, there is still events that will never be forgotten. Their anecdotes will exhibited in museums, taught in schools and read in books. And even in today's society, there are things that haven't been fully revived. To this day, families who been affected by the Holocaust are still in demand to restore things that have been lost and will never stop until justice is served. Many of these relics, artifacts and personal property have never been returned to their personal owners. Many of these treasures include paintings that were placed in museums and art galleries. While others are still in possession just waiting to be claimed. 'Woman in Gold' is the true story of an elderly lady who wants to return the titular portrait back to her family, though it's no easy task since it's been stored in an Austrian museum.Helen Mirren stars as Maria Altmann. a Jewish Holocaust survivor. She and her husband narrowly escape Nazi-occupied Austria, abandoning her parents while migrating to the United States. Her family were aficionados in the world of art. Her uncle sponsored paintings from Gustav Klimt who had a painting of his wife who died before the invasion commenced. The Nazis confiscated every precious belongings that her family owned, a lot of them were pretty expensive too.Her aunt's portrait is now resting at the Belvedere Museum where it is being dubbed as 'The Lady in Gold'. Several decades later, Maria wants to reclaim so her hires a friend's son who was a lawyer named Randy Schoenberg (Ryan Reynolds) to take it to court in order to win it back.Though there are scenes told in flashbacks about the horrific events that took place in WWII and though there is a plethora of ground to be covered, it is still a courtroom drama. Many justices of the law were on hand during this trial and lots of documents had to be in order for them to win their case. And though several decades younger than Maria, Randy's heartbreaks come through the stories his grandparents endured while Maria saw Hitler's evil ways from an eye's view. Randy is joined by an Austrian journalist name Hubertus Czernin (Daniel Bruhl) who arbitrarily offers his service knowing full well about his family's bad legacy. The flashbacks reflect upon a young Maria through good times and bad ones and are used to great effect especially where her court battle marks her return to her country that she abandoned decades ago.We can always depend on Mirren to deliver a great performance and her accent was spot on. The odd pairing she has with Reynolds seems natural more like a mother/son relationship over a lawyer/client relationship. Reynolds really played the lawyer like he was a professional lawyer. Tatiana Maslany shows her inner 'Orphan Black' character as the younger Maria as she's on the run constantly. Her emotions were priceless. Sure a lot of material is covered in 'Woman in Gold', but everything falls into place.",8,0,0,20 August 2019
Groundhog Day," Funniest Bill Murray Movie To Date
","Sure there is a thing in life that everyone deserves forgiveness. Even when we all screw up, whether one or one billion times over and over again, we must always forgive for all who have made mistakes because in the thick of it all, we as humans are all screwed up in some way. Whether we admit it or not. Local weather reporter Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is a condescending, arrogant, sarcastic individual who has been assigned the task to cover a fluff story on Groundhog Day, right in the heart of small town Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania where Punnxsutawney Phil, the groundhog will pop his head out of his burrow, cast his shadow to tell us six more weeks of winter. This doesn't impress Phil who feels like this is insulting to his intelligence. Just as Phil was about to return to Pittsburgh, a blizzard approaches so he ad his crew which includes his producer Rita Hanson (Andie McDowall) and his cameraman Larry (Chris Elliott) to spend a night at a hotel in the area. Only to realize that the next day, it's Groundhog Day all over again and everything that happened yesterday repeats itself again the next day and the day after and so on. Phil is trapped in some kind of vortex will tomorrow never comes. What really makes the movie 'Groundhog Day' work is that underneath the comedy and fantasy plotting is that there's a low- prolific genre of mystery involved as we try to piece the puzzle as to how Phil can get out of this bubble so that tomorrow can come and a new day will happen. While he knows that his every waking moment are the same people dong the same things like yesterday, everybody else surrounding Phil are completely oblivious. And through every repeated day, he always has an advantage. An advantage to go over his day and reconsider his wrong ways and in hopes to change his ways and thoughts and to become a better person. The perfect individual for this task to be a better character is his co-worker Rita, who has been quite patient towards Phil's demands, quips and general lack of courtesy. As the repeated days go by where everything's planted in terms of routine, he starts to become nicer and friendlier to Rita until one particular Groundhog Day, she finally falls in love with him and a new day begins and the curse is broken. Though it's primarily a comedy, there are very high levels of thought-provoking factors we can all certainly reflect upon. Like Bill Murray's 1988 movie classic 'Scrooged', Murray is playing a similar cranky character going through extraordinary predicaments in order to live through his mistakes and to break through these burdens in order to become a better person. Even though it's a Groundhog Day movie, there is another Christmas movie that has a similar plot as well, 'It's a Wonderful Life' where James Stewart's George Bailey stuck in a life where everyone's woeful without him. In 'Groundhog Day' Phil discovers that everyone would be happier if he was not involved in their lives. Directed and co-written by longtime friend of Murray's Harold Ramis, they have collaborated in several films in 1970's, 1980's and like 'Stripes' and 'Ghostbusters' and though they had a fallout after this movie, it was nice that Murray and Ramis made peace with each other before Ramis' death in 2014. Unlike 'Scrooged' which had a more darker, misanthropic edge to its comedy, Groundhog Day' was lighter in tone and had a more greater feeling of optimism. The change of heart was well executed as the story flowed nicely, I did fall off the edge of my chair laughing at the early scenes as Phil was giving the weather report in smarmy, cynical way and cursing at the curse that brought him on journey to redemption. The film at the time was original in delivery with a well added twist that has morals placed in while it refrains from anything remotely preachy about it. Sometimes we need a refresher course and to comes to terms that in life, we got everything we want and more and to appreciate them while we can. Our time here on Earth is limited, we just have to make the most of it.",8,0,0,20 November 2017
Shine," Geoffrey Rush's Performance Carries The Film
","If there are any faults to the 1996 Australian film 'Shine', is that it is taken under control of a narrative that is at times very clichéd. Also pretty sketchy is the sequences of events writer/director Scott Hicks puts into the film. But still the film is saturated with sheer brilliance as it tells the tale of piano genius David Helfgott (Geoffrey Rush)as we chronicle his story from the time he was a child, to a troubled young soul to an out of it adult and was played off nothing short of brilliance.We first see Helfgott's problem stemming from his father, Holocaust survivor Polish-Jewish born Peter Helfgott (Armin Mueller-Stahl) who was very domineering in nature as he subjugates him which at times can be both a bit over-the-top but still very compelling to watch. I understand this is a biopic and not a documentary and there's bound to be some sort of dramatization, but it's hard to fully admit it or not if Peter Helfgott was really that cruel to David. Nevertheless it's very impossible that that this cruelty can ever be erased from David's mind and any kind of burden would be difficult to climb.'Shine' then transitions towards David's youth to adult years (Noah Taylor and eventually Geoffrey Rush) where he gets the right training and musical experience with legions of friends helping him along the way. We see him succeed through his music to the point where he suffers a nervous breakdown which leads him to fifteen years institutionalized. However, once he's released, he comes back to playing great music in front of packed crowds and we as an audience cheer for his return as he was able to fight his way back to the top. There's a lot of quality behind it and it work effectively. In some ways the format feel very much like a sports film with a formulaic twist, but it's still very good in quality. We have the underdog musician with potential for greatness, then something lures him away, gets out of the jam and then faces the toughest challenge and then beats the odds.Even though underdog stories in movies are quite predictable, but why this one is orchestrated this way is simply because it works. The story is easy to follow through and never cowers away from scenes that can be at times unpleasant for the eyes. The flow of the story just runs naturally. The complexities regarding Peter's fathering towards his son and David's musical skills can be quite layered and compelling.If there was a weakness to 'Shine' it would be that the three stages of his life seem to skim over and didn't have a complete disclosure behind it while the interesting scenes usurp the dramatic ones. The transformation between a sensitive kid with a quirky persona to the fragile eccentric can be complex in detail as life struggles David faces we aren't fully invested because it happens right from the early parts of the movie we know his capabilities are right there.Performance wise the acting is really good. Geoffrey Rush is the rightful person to win the Oscar but his role is oddly selected due to the character being the ones that you've seen many times before. The remaining cast members range from solid acting to just going through the routines that Hollywood favours. Aside from that they play off the more natural performance Rush's acting ability to grasp at David's incoherent quirks and limited attention span.Often times Hollywood likes their communications to be delivered very crisply. Very few people grasp or pause for words, it's all delivered straight and to the point and that's very acceptable. When a typical off-camera conversation comes on-camera, it takes the tone aback while the wheels are turning. What makes Rush's performance stand out is that we see a personality that is fractured that's contrary to the normal behaviour from his peers. The whole film may be Oscar inclined, but through Rush's acting this film's worthy to watch.",8,0,0,19 February 2017
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Comedy Caper And Crime Guarantees a Good Time
","If you combine Quentin Tarantino movies with a bit of Marx Brothers slapstick humour you get 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels'. All you have to do is picture Chico severing your fingers. The quirkiness may be fun to watch, but this comedy crime caper is overwhelmingly wallowing in its complexities and is handled quite efficiently. It comes as an obvious trait that Guy Ritchie used to direct commercials if you noticed a scene where a man is throwing vegetables into the water and we get a close-up to the bottom of the pot. The plot focuses on a poker star from the rough side of London's East End named Eddy (Nick Moran) who gets hired by three alliances to gamble up his profits to a high stakes game against Hatchet Harry (P.H. Moriarty), who is a kingpin in the gambling a porn industry. Harry uses dirty tactics to win which leaves Eddy in a bind and Harry's guard Benny the Baptist (Lenny McLean) gives these suckers three options,either pay up, take over the pub that's owned by Eddy's father JD (Sting) or get your fingers severed. So Eddy and his friends snoop on the neighbours in their apartment who happen to be crooks with a master plan to rob from a rich druggie. All this is happening, Barry hires two bumbling thieves to confiscate some authentic antique guns for Harry . The guns wind up in Eddy and his gang, rob the drug money and then the rest of the way needs no further explaining. Or do you if you want me to give away spoilers which I won't. The movie turned out to be a very successful film back in Britain. In North America it came out first at the Sundance Film Festival. Although it was entertaining fun, you could still get lost in the shuffle due to the confusing plot and the English lingo in a very British film. But after a second viewing, I understood the dialogue better and plot felt less convoluted. It's safe to say the characters were a little miscast due to the fact that they might be a bit too young and inexperienced for a very gritty film. Unlike Tarantino who in 'Reservoir Dogs' used veteran performers in his film. Eddy's gang comes across as a bit too youthful to be dealing with scumbags or even running around London with these scamps. And with the neighbours being druggies, it's hard to come by as to who is who. The more convincing cast members are from the antagonists Harry and Barry and even impressive was the character who played Big Chris (soccer star Vinnie Jones) who was notorious for choking a rival by the balls. But through the mindset of the East End it looks believable in the settings being that it is dark, cold and the scoundrels that surround the area add to the authenticity that London is not all blessed with royalty and fish n chips. In spite of its dreariness, there is a lot of excitement that comes with this movie. The soundtrack featuring mostly rock music is the perfect choice of the atmosphere. The narration keeps the story to a steady flow and is not afraid to add runaway gags if feel the need to. When Eddy and his gang enter into a pub we see a man in flames staggering at the door. They stare at him concernedly, nod their heads and walk in. The pub they walk into is called Samoa Joe's a spoof of 'Pulp Fiction' with Big Kahuna Burgers and and Jack Rabbit Slim's restaurant and they're also sipping drinks with the little umbrellas too. There's a lot of Tarantino influences this movie has to provide and spotting the references can almost feel like a game. That and along with other Hong Kong based film and British noir films of the 1950's. The closest this film comes to a striking resemblance is the 1950 British noir film 'Night and the City' which is a criminal caper set in the East End and a high stakes kingpin hires a buffed up bodyguard to do his dirty work. As the film comes to the close you try to decipher what had just transpired. As it turns out the style fairly outweighs the substance and it never tries to deny such claims. We don't care much about the characters (though I was intrigued by the character Barry the Baptist over anyone else). The film's humour factor lies within the style of utilizing freeze frames, witty subtitles and speed-up and slow-motion angles. But it's still a fun slapdash film with exuberance and intrigue so if you can't encode to their English dialect, the characters add enough excitement to overcome that obstacle.",8,1,1,5 December 2016
The Da Vinci Code," Went Beyond My Expectations
","All the bookworms might put me in jail and throw away the keys but I'm here to confess that I had never read the controversial novel by Dan Brown. When I first saw 'The Da Vinci Code' I just walked in with a clear mind and a clean slate. People might hate for it, I saw the movie before I ever had the the chance to read the book. I may not be the only one, but at least I'm coming clean with you all. From what I've watch I'm pretty sure Brown must have some keen eye on artistic intentions and has high interests in prose. Friends tried to get me to see this movie just to see what all the fuss was about, even though I never got around to reading the book. From words of people who did read the novel, the script by Akiva Goldsman, pretty much follows through most of the important parts of the novel which in itself could potentially ensure with some level of satisfaction. After seeing it for the first I was absolutely very fond of this movie. It didn't waste time introducing the concept of the plot and it was executed quite nuanced and in full detail and once that was done the thrills just take off from there. In Paris, Louvre curator Jacques Sauniere (Jean-Pierre Marielle) has been murdered by an albino complexioned assassin named Silas (Paul Bettany) who's under the guidance of someone known as 'The Teacher'. That's when moody Harvard symbologist Dr. Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is requested by the French police to decipher the clues that led to Sauniere's death and the esoteric markings he's left behind. Police cryptographer Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou) also gets involved in the crime. Langdon's now been labeled as a primary suspect and is now on the run and the chase is on.Langdon and Neveu seem to have different sets of enemies. The French law enforcement lead by Captain Fache (Jean Reno) seems to be hot on their trail and are inches from catching them. The other seems to be the Roman Catholic Church who seems to be hiding some sort of dark secret that can't be revealed. Silas along with the Bishop Aringarosa (Alfred Molina) join forces to bring our heroes down. The closest ally to our protagonists is Sir Leigh Teabing (Ian McKellen) to Robert and Sophie if the want to escape from their enemies and unraveling this encoded sacred secret. Only to know later what's really Teabing's motives are.So now as I see it the genre has jumped from a murder mystery to crime-drama to becoming a religious mystery that will likely intrigue the inner theologian in you. There are a lot of suspenseful events leading to their chases and that is all right with me. The mysterious decoding will like spark my interests which is quite amazing. The actual Da Vinci code itself looks complex and very exhilarating as we the audience are left scratching our heads and the continual clues will like keep you glued to your seats. And the piecing together seem precise and never feels confusing and the pacing is well executed. There's some good dialogue to go along and never does it wear out its welcome. The imaginative imagery is an added addition and the flashbacks to historical events makes more sense in what our heroes are unraveling. Maybe by not reading the book first might not have been entirely a bad thing. Those who have read the novel were harsh about this movie mainly because they're nitpicking at every error or inaccuracy about this movie. I feel if I did read the book it might have dampened my spirit about the movie. But I was hooked on this movie partially because I didn't read the book and expected the unexpected. I have some knowledge about the historical events to get enough information about what they're deciphering. Overall, I had a lot of fun with 'The Da Vinci Code'. Goldsman's script ran at a respectable pace. Another factor is the originality of the story. It's a mystery thriller based not on crime or murder but on religious symbolism even with cops and crooks. And we can't neglect the thin linings between fact and fiction. And while the emphasis is based on religious relics like the Holy Blood and the Holy Grail, and asks the insightful question if the Holy Grail could be the balance that could change the world.

The Shape of Water," Del Toro At His Peak
","Set in the year 1962, 'The Shape of Water' is about a mute lady named Elisa Esposito, who works as a cleaning lady at a top secret laboratory run by the government in Washington D.C. Feeling that her life will never change for the better, she along with her colleague Zelda Fuller (Octavia Spencer) find a horrendous looking amphibious humanoid held in captivity by the government authorities who want to dissect the creature, but Elisa begins to befriend the creature and makes it her mission to set it free.Under the direction from Guillermo Del Toro, we see a rare fantasy story that's not set in mystical lands or some exaggerated place beyond our imagination, but set in our world just decades past. In a statement Del Toro said that this movie was one he felt very satisfied in making. Don't just take his words though, this movie received a plethora of awards including four Oscar wins.The movie itself is the perfect combination of intriguing storytelling mixed with visuals that are vintage Del Toro and excellent performances by the ensemble cast. Plus we can't ignore the fact that everything that Del Toro does will likely be eccentric and enlightening.Obviously inspired by classic monster movies and in this case, 'The Creature from the Black Lagoon', from 1954, Del Toro had British actress Sally Hawkins in mind for the role as Eliza and Hawkins surely did not disappoint. Even though she plays a mute, she can still find ways to see the inner beauty of this creature who was subliminally brought to life by Doug Jones.This film allows us to see some similarities between this and other fairy tales about princesses getting romantically linked with creatures that are not particularly human. Though Eliza is not blessed with royalty and the creature will not transform into a white knight on a steed. But Del Toro doesn't care about that he wants us to see how love should never be judged by its cover and that no matter how you look, love is for everyone.Aside from Hawkins and Jones, they are joined by an eclectic diverse range of interesting characters both good an evil. We have Spencer who provides much needed comic relief as the only other friend of Eliza who acts as her sign language translator, and fellow cleaner, Zelda. We have Michael Stuhlbarg as Dimitri Mosenkov who's going incognito as Dr. Robert Hoffstetler who's a Russian spy secretly posing as a scientist to get enough information on the creature, and Elisa's other friend Giles (Richard Jenkins) her insecure neighbour who works as an advertising artist.However, the real scene stealing performance comes from Michael Shannon as the tyrannical leader of this operation Col. Richard Strickland. His mission is to keep this creature in isolation and to make sure he's well disciplined. Even it means utilizing brutal ways like charging him with an electric cattle prod. Shannon takes great depth to make us despise this character that seems to take the pleasure to hurt the creature and fear those around him. What could have been a one dimensional villain character Del Toro who co-wrote the script with Vanessa Taylor gave Strickland a back story as to what caused him to be the way that he is.The narration for 'The Shape of Water' is backed up by Del Toro's colour choices and has an impressive soundtrack from Alexandre Desplat. The visuals are vibrant and stunning. Each scene has a similar visual vibe in some of his other films from the past like 'Crimson Tide' or 'Pan's Labyrinth'.The main colour for this flick is green which remains symbolic from Elisa's apparel to the key lime pie that Giles consumes, to the candy that Strickland eats, to the monster itself. In fact green is the omnipresent colour featured here, any other colours seems like an illusion.A big shout out goes to the cinematography from Dan Laustsen, whose impressive visuals showed that this film was equal in both style and substance. It's these visuals complimented by this brilliant story that make this movie very magical and enticing.Del Toro once spoke out to reporters that he was always curious about that real meaning of love. After seeing 'The Shape of Water' and creating the right characters in the right atmosphere I firmly believe Del Toro answered his own question both stunningly and visually.",10,2,8,14 September 2019
The Untouchables," Has Memorable Moments But Very Unoriginal
","Directed by Brian De Palma, 'The Untouchables' is a classic remake of the television series as our hero G-Man (Kevin Costner) as he tracks down his arch nemesis the notorious gangster Al Capone (Robert De Niro) and to bring his enterprise down with him during the infamous Chicago Prohibition era. Struggling to catch up or get any word among Capone's whereabouts, Ness hires a veteran cop named Jimmy Malone (Oscar winning Sean Connery). The cast also includes other big stars like Andy Garcia as a rookie cop George Stone/Giuseppe Petri and Charles Martin Smith as Oscar Wallace.The story is pretty much everything you would expect from a movie like this. We see Ness doing everything in his power to dethrone Capone and offer him justice served cold but not very successfully. The money trail leaves them from one dead-end street to another with no trace of Capone's hideouts. But Capone's trail being followed also marked the end of his empire. If the pieces can be added up nicely, it will be evident that Capone owes the government a substantial amount of back taxes and evasion as we all know is major felony. Wallace, a certified accountant claims that tax evasion itself would be a gargantuan penalty if Capone was just charged on that alone. And as what comes with that an abundance of deaths occurred during this mob war era.The characters richness is what makes 'The Untouchables' a very riveting movie. All the characters are multilayered with the exception of the leading character, Ness, who comes off pretty wooden and seems to be more opposing to the character of Capone who's quite charismatic and the wittiness and dry comical dialogue by Connery are the ones that I enjoy watching the most. Even Andy Garcia and Charles Martin Smith had lots of panache and the chemistry each character had towards one another makes this movie very special. The direction by Brian De Palma was fascinating, while the score by Ennio Morricone adds the right texture to the time period this movie was set in. The props and costumes were accurate. It felt like we had traveled back to the time of the Prohibition era.There are a lot of great scenes going on in 'The Untouchables'. One of the many scenes involved Capone's seminar about the benefits of teamwork as he tells his band of syndicates and it results in a man getting pulverized by a baseball bat. The focus on the blood splattering out of the man's head and all the syndicate's reactions is a scene that will linger in my mind till eternity. The other standout was the ambush located at the train station which ends with Agent Stone diving to save a runaway baby carriage while keeping his weapon at tow. This scene will send chills up everyone's spine.Overall, this truly is one of the more engaging mobster movies of all times. It has great characters and the dialogue is remarkable and the characters truly draw onto you very nicely. Sure there's nothing original about the plot or the outcome, but the development of the characters and the technical aspects make this movie one you have to see to believe.",9,0,1,10 February 2014
The Godfather: Part III," A Sequel That was Not Needed
","I'm not going to say it was an entire awful movie, but after the success of the first two 'Godfather' franchises, there was no necessity in making a third sequel. Even director Francis Ford Coppola admitted that the sagas come from 'Parts I and II' and that 'The Godfather Part III' was nothing more than a glorified epilogue. The only purpose as to why he made this third installment was because his bravado was going down plus he was in a financial crunch and was lured in by Paramount to make a third movie as a key to his financial comeback. He could've resisted the temptation, but he decided to give it the old college try. I just wished that he made another flop than to make 'The Godfather III'. At least with the flop it would've been an honest one and less manipulative. The flaws in this movie are by the bundles, where to begin we can say that the plot does not have the same bite that its predecessor's have in their grasp. Even though at 2 hours and 42 minutes long it feels a lot longer and some scenes tend to drag on for too long, especially the scenes that take place in Sicily. Michael and Kay's (Al Pacino and Diane Keaton) quiet time together should have been axed out entirely. This movie is not a romantic tale, so therefore Coppola unless he was trying to get more female audience members to see this film, there was no need for any kind of dragged out romantic interludes to this story. For those who wish to use Sofia Coppola as the main poison to this this film may have crossed the line a bit here. Yes I agree she couldn't act worth a nickel, but she was only on for a very short time and her contribution to the film is quite minimal. Granted if they would've casted either Julia Roberts of Winona Ryder for the part of Mary Corleone, they could've made the character all the more compelling. But Mary is only very minor role so it really would not have made much of a difference. Another key factor to why this film is inferior to the other two 'Godfathers' is the absence of Robert Duvall's character Tom Hagen. Duvall was interested in reprising his role and demanded to Mr. Coppola an equal salary like Pacino, but he was rebuffed at his request and backed out of the project. With that in mind Coppola edited out that Hagen died and that George Hamilton's B.J. Harrison was cast as the new attorney to the Corleone's estate. The only living relative to the Hagen name was Father Andrew Hagen played by John Savage whose role was absolutely useless. If there was any newbie that holds any kind of interest was Andy Garcia's performance as Vincent Corleone, the son of James Caan's character the late Sonny Corleone and Michael's nephew. The first of the trilogy had young Michael trying to take over the family empire after Sonny and Fredo were not eligible for such as task. Michael wanted legitimacy within his family's legacy. It would've been better if Vincent became the successor and to bring the family back to conducting illegal tactics to bring back their old ways again. The script gets within those parameters, but the distractions are way too abundant.Another note to point out is that the change in Michael is way to obvious and at time can be unnatural. After the second film Michael was raging force to be reckoned with, but now a lot older and more gravely ill, he is now begging for forgiveness for all the things he's done. I understand that as you get older you look back and think of all the things you've done. In Michael's case, he's like he's been resurrected from the first film, feeling a bit ashamed he's from a Mafia family and wants no part of it, but in family honour, he'll attack when his family needs him when no one else will intervene. I have no problem with this change, but the process is never fully clarified due to the lacklustre script. It just gives me the impression he's scared of dying and just wants one last breath of redemption before the coffin closes. I did like what they did with script by adding some real events that happened in the Roman Catholic Church during the late 1970's when the majority of the film takes place. Such events like the banking scandal of the Vatican and the unfortunate mysterious death of the Pope John Paul I after becoming the pope 33 days before. It wasn't an awful movie, but with a much tighter editing job and a more revised script, then 'The Godfather Part III' would have been a much better film. And sure people have panned this film horribly, it doesn't deserve that much lambasting. However, it was very poorly executed and it still stands as a very inferior film from the other two chapters.",6,5,8,20 July 2015
Mystic River," Engaging Movie That'll Leave You Stunned
","Clint Eastwood's brings this thrilling adaptation of Dennis Lehane's novel to life and does a remarkable job recreating the events featured in the novel. Being the loyal guy that I am, I managed to read the novel before having the chance to watch it in the theaters; therefore my expectations were pretty high. Surely enough, I was impressed by the heart and dedication Mr. Eastwood put into consideration in restoring the events from the novel and at the same time provides us with well detailed characters that were the exact images like in the book.Sean Penn plays the leading role of Jimmy Markum, a storekeeper who had a dark past as a hoodlum and was imprisoned for his misdemeanors. Years later he has cleaned up his act, makes a decent living, devoted to his wife and kids and has put his horrid past behind him. In his younger days he became allies with Sean Devine (Kevin Bacon), who is now a crime scene investigator, and David Boyle (Tim Robbins), who had experienced a devastating occurrence in his youth and the events he saw continue to linger on in his brain to this day forward. News that Jimmy's 19-year-old daughter Katie was tragically murdered, Sean along with his partner Whitey Powers (Laurence Fisburne), proceed with the investigation and the childhood friend reunion comes into full force.The dynamic cast is what makes 'Mystic River' so engaging to watch and is a must-see for those who admire murder mysteries and the pivotal events that transpire along as the two detectives search for Katie's murderer. It feels like the actors are not just playing the part but are actually living the roles that were given to them. Sean Penn gives a rather heartbreaking but affectionate performance as we feel for his tragic loss. Tim Robbins was convincing in his role, you get this sudden feeling that he's about to do something not very pleasant. Laura Linney and Marcia Gay Harden were also effective as the respected wives of Jimmy and Dave.The idea of filming this movie in Boston was a wise decision by Eastwood as we look to great admiration at the brilliant atmosphere created by Tom Stern which gives it a very believable and a setting that's apropos to the genre of the movie. 'Mystic River' gives a flabbergasting demonstration of how the human race reacts when they're under an overwhelming amount of mental pain. It proves that the people we hurt or the people who hurt us back will remain within us for a very long period of time, probably even forever. I like to give kudos to Clint Eastwood for making our day and giving us an eye-popping provocative picture that the vast majority will enjoy.",9,1,2,27 February 2012
A Beautiful Mind," Credit For Effort, But Far From Greatness
","Granted, 'A Beautiful Mind' is nowhere close to a classic and certainly not one of 2001's best film. But the hard work and effort put into this movie by Ron Howard and writer Akiva Goldsman should not go ignored. Especially Goldsman who was responsible for that god-awful fallacy that is 'Batman and Robin'. This biopic follows the life of mathematical genius with a mental illness, John Nash the many obstacles he conquered over the years. I won't delve into the plot too much as there's a major plot twist in the midway point of the movie that turns the tables on the scenes before it.Heard from other people around me, 'A Beautiful Mind' historical portrayal of John Nash is not 100% in terms of accuracy, but I was willing to forgive that knowing that a movie had many times before this one has utilized exaggerated dramatic effect to appeal to the mass. In fact, I'm giving praise of the structure it was to making this movie and what its intentions were which was to marvel at a mentally ill man's triumphs to win the prestigious Nobel Prize in 1994. So in way this movie can come across as a well-effort feel-good movie in its own merits.Although hands off for the efforts of Howard's direction and Goldsman's script, it is not the real reason why this film is just average. I don't even think they should earned the Oscars awards they unceremoniously received. Howard lacks in subtlety and just can't get his grip on a simple planned drama. Many of the scene's emotional stages are overdone and cliché laden, like breaking stuff in anger, crying and pouting, nothing really new here. But to be fair I will say that the pacing was reasonable, and it feels as the scenes progress it looks very immaculate.The last and final minutes is the weakest scene. Sure I was proud when Nash finally won the Nobel Prize, but it's the clichéd heartfelt speech that made me cringe and it clearly neglects what the movie was originally intended to accomplish. Sure Howard wasn't trying to spoonfeed us with how the film plods along, but to spoil us with the obvious message could have easily been handled earlier in the movie instead of dragging on for two hours. Okay now that I've pointed most of the bad points of this movie, I still thought it had plenty to offer to the audience. It comes from the scintillating performances by Russell Crowe as mentally unbalanced John Nash and Jennifer Connolly as his wife Alicia Larde Nash who just amazed me and had me begging her for more screen time. It's a crying shame that we know very little about her and what she did in her lifetime that she was providing for him in his later years. Crowe captures the essence of Nash's character, but his tics look more like acting rather than playing it natural. There was a very meager love story between John and Alicia, and there's no purpose as to why she's smitten for Nash.Schizophrenia is the main topic dealt with in the movie. And even though I have Aspberger's Syndrome, which is another mental illness, I have some knowledge of what it's like to carry a burden like what Mr. Nash carries. I guess I could say this movie fends off some of the misconceptions other movie's have dealt with on the topic of this illness this one might come the closest to being the most accurate in its portrayal.Sure it may have a Hollywood feel to the premise, the intentions of 'A Beautiful Mind' are credited for taking the approach sensitively.",6,0,1,29 November 2010
When Harry Met Sally...," The Performances Are Just Magical
","Though I am not the biggest aficionado of romantic comedies, but there are two romantic comedies that that are absolutely spell-binding. The first one is Annie Hall and the other one is the classic 1989 movie When Harry Met Sally. What makes When Harry Met Sally standout is the glaring energetic integrity it has backed up by the equally compelling script by the late Nora Ephron which goes beyond the formulaic run-of-the-mill boy-meets-girl cliché that most romantic comedies suffer through.The emotional build-up has a lot coming for it from the beginning and never once does it ever go back. Harry Burns (Billy Crystal) and Sally Albright (Meg Ryan) have been meeting each several times since 1977. They first started off as total strangers as they drive together from Chicago to New York City as sexual intentions eventually keep them apart. Years later, they run into each other now both career-oriented (Harry is political consultant and Sally is a journalist). The charisma and the chemistry between Crystal and Ryan wants us to see their characters fall in love and get married. Sadly, they are still head-blocked by their previous relationships which put them at doubt of committing to getting into another relationship.The feisty performances of the two leading stars compliments nicely to the script that Ephron wrote. Even though Billy Crystal has a one-dimensional character, he still manages to pull off some sleaziness within the character of Harry Burns. Whereas Sally has a personality that changes in many different places. When we are first introduced to her she comes off as a vulnerable determined college graduate ready to take on all challenges that the world wishes to throw at us. But with all the trials and tribulations that manifest with the issues on relationships which gives her a newer more alert perspective of the world around her. Ryan goes through this transition so naturally, we never really see it coming.Ephron was a master in her own craft writing script filled with a cornucopia of hilarious perspective of human relationships throughout her career as a scriptwriter. Here in When Harry Met Sally, we look through both genders perspectives about relationships on an even field. Harry sees that men and women have sex does not have room just being friends. That applies to anyone who has been in a relationship before. Every scene has a reason, even the brief scene with the elderly couples also contributes the purpose of this movie.Over the years, director Rob Reiner has made mediocre as of late. But it is very pleasing that When Harry Met Sally was released we can reflect back to when he made quality films like these. His colorful direction and Ephron and her brilliant script make just as much of an effective couple as Harry and Sally were. The endearing couple are so likable we actually care if they get together no matter what direction in life they wish to pursue.",9,0,0,24 February 2014
Love Actually," Not Enough Grant But Too Much Elevator Music
","Due to his stature as the icon for British culture, complete with with aristocratic accents, and an immaculate view of upper-class London, writer/director Richard Curtis truly has the substance factor in his favour. However in his holiday season themed film 'Love Actually', he throws all that posh out the window in resorts to sentimental gush, saccharine music and indecorous humour. This is a far cry from 'Four Weddings and a Funeral'.It's great that Curtis called up his partner in crime Hugh Grant to be one of the stars in 'Love Actually', but he's been rendered down to a small supporting role and is lost in the crowd to the over-stacked ensemble cast. Grant plays the part of David, who's been a newly elected British Prime Minister, his comical moments truly usurps the other who's who in this ultra-British cast that includes Emma Thompson, Bill Nighy and Alan Rickman. In his witty and subtle demeanour, Grant has become a stapled icon in the romantic comedy genre and can generate a lot of humourous moments with his twitches and in this instant, the shake of his tush.A character break into dance mode has become common in romantic comedies, but Grant conveys a new and eccentric twist to what is an awkward predicament. When he was dancing to The Pointer Sisters' 'Jump (For My Love)' we can see how embarrassed he his doing it, but his sportsmanship is something we can applaud to. With all these intertwining subplots, the one that's barely given screen time involves around Prime Minister David as he's mitten over his ravishing assistant Natalie (Martine McCutcheon). The chemistry between the sophisticated Prime Minister and the slightly lower class help is the one that sparked my interest the most. McCutcheon even adds an original twist to her character by breaking the cliche of the cute newly in love assistant by unceremoniously swearing at her superior.The opening scenes centres around the week before the holiday season as the ever-present variation of a Mod rock song 'Love is All Around' with a hint of holiday cheer is rubbed into our faces. Yes the British love their pop music and Curtis is not ashamed to exploit that to us. He did a similar thing in 'Four Wedding and Funeral' with 'Bye Bye Baby' by the Bay City Rollers. This eye-roller sets the tone of many absurd things to come.With a myriad of romantic subplots, they could all stretch to half an hour segments before we see them one more time. Sadly, not all of them were not given enough time and could've easily been edited out. One example would be the body doubles John and Judy (Martin Freeman and Johanna Page) who are dating quietly while giving fake orgies on the movie sets. Or the story involving a hopeless romantic named Colin (Kris Marshall) who travels to America to use his British accent to woo hot women, which to me felt like an overlong coke commercial. Still most of the stories work due to the talent pool and the good vibes it brings to the story.Liam Neeson is wonderful as a widowed man named Daniel who's 11 year old stepson Sam (Thomas Sangster) seeks his first crush, an American girl named Joanna (Olivia Olson). Sangster conveys a daring and dashing presence of energy in his character, but his drive feels too young and forced for his age. However, his comic skills when he meets his dreamboat for the first time is flawless.Colin Firth plays a sympathetic note here as Jamie who after feeling betrayed by his girlfriend (Sienna Guillory) hides out to his French cottage and gets love-struck by his Portuguese maid Aurelia (Lucia Moniz) though they can't speak each other's language, the magic comes from the fact that the language of love bears no boundaries. Moniz embodies a keen sense of intelligence and seductiveness to her character. Both Moniz and McCutcheon are more interesting performers than the more established ones here. Emma Thompson's housewife Karen believes that her husband Harry (Alan Rickman) is secretly having an affair with his sultry receptionist, Mia (Heike Makatsch). Thompson and Rickman's talents are badly wasted here and their cliched ways proves the point here. The love between each other makes it hard to believe that Harry is a cheater and when Karen who was expecting an expensive necklace from Harry as a Christmas gift only to realize that the gift was not for her (her's was a Joni Mitchell CD) we get the music score running with Mitchell's weary version of 'Both Sides Now'. The song was nice I felt bad for Karen, but it still was drained out.Laura Linney plays Sarah, who works at Harry's company and is attracted to her co-worker Karl (Rodrigo Santoro), but the relationship is set back due to her mentally ill brother, Michael (Michael Fitzgerald). Sure Curtis like to include somber pieces to his agenda, but the thing that transpire in this subplot results in strange and jarring moments. Bill Nighy has equal comical moments as Grant playing a has-been rock star knows his best years are behind him, but still has some optimism that his awful holiday song might be the keys to comeback and promotes this song at a gala event hosted by Sir Elton John. While he and his partner Joe (Gregor Fisher) spend the holidays inebriated and watching porn.Yes the British strive to get a #1 single has been a tradition since the 1960's which has a community feeling in the UK than it does in America. Sure the cost of oneness is expensive, especially having to deal with saccharine music.",7,1,2,23 April 2018
Wedding Crashers," Frat Pack Up To Their Usual Antics
",".The Frat Pack had over the years took the comical movies by storm. With the Wilson Brothers, Ben Stiller, Will Ferrell, Vince Vaughn and Jack Black they had really got their brand of formula of comedy down to a tee. I have really gotten a kick of the films they starred in including 'Old School', Dodgeball', Zoolander' and of course 'Wedding Crashers'. Unless you are all living under a rock, you should expect by now that their kind of comedy isn't subtle or dry. The comedy depicted here is basically lewd, crude and downright rude. The leading protagonists will likely be kicked around a lot in the private areas. Toilet jokes will also be likely to come up here and there. There is likely to be a pairing with one of the two (in this case Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn). with the possibility of a cameo with another Frat Packer. And of course you will expect the pivotal tender scene where we reveal the hero's softer side which leads to the climax where our hero emerges victorious and lets not forget an engaging montage.Some people may call it a formulaic comedy, but I like to refer to it as a tradition and to me I ask why spoil a good thing? But unlike the other Frat Pack movies, 'Wedding Crashers' has some substance added to it. I was impressed by the female leads' performances. Isla Fisher and Rachel McAdams were phenomenal as the love interests for John Beckwith and Jeremy Grey (Wilson and Vaughn) who also happen to be the daughters of the treasury secretary. Bradley Cooper is quite hilarious as preppy guy who's not all that sane. Jane Seymour sinks her teeth into some comic support as the Secretary's wife who tries to seduce John. Will Ferrell has a unsettling cameo as a man trying to search for girls at funerals. Sadly though, Christopher Walken doesn't really have that much to do.What separates 'Wedding Crashers' from the other Frat Pack Movies before and after is that we see a familiar story of grown-up boys morphing into men. For John and Jeremy, they eventually find their true love by way of irony when all they really wanted was to crash wedding parties just to get an easy #$%$. So in spite of the side-splitting laughter, there is a bit of coming-of-age that's exhibited behind the the insane zaniness of 'Wedding Crashers'. Based on the fans' ovation at the theatre, this movie was the most hilarious comedy of the year. That and the hilarious 'The 40 Year-Old Virgin.' For those who are sensitive about the content, I should warn you that there's a lot of nudity and sexual references delivered here. Quite a lot of smoking and drinking involved. There's a lot of cussing in the language department. In addition to that there are scenes involving foot fetishes and bondage. For the homophobes out there there is also gay acts as well. If these situations offend you in any way, it's never too late to turn back now.",9,0,0,4 February 2013
The Bridge on the River Kwai," Character Film Bogged Down to Anti-War Preachiness
","In the Golden Age of cinema, David Lean was dubbed as the king of epics. One of his more high-prolific entries into that category was the 1957 classic 'The Bridge on the River Kwai'. To me the top priority of this movie wasn't emphasized on World War II. The film centres around a strict, but well-defined British officer Col. Nicholson (Alec Guinness), a lesser disciplined American soldier Commander Shears (William Holden) and a tyrant prison officer Col. Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) who were placed in a Japanese prison camp where they were forced into labour to build the railway bridge over the River Kwai that connects from Bangkok and Rangoon. While this is done these three individuals try everything to co-exist with one another. You see very little of the war. The abysmal conditions of the prison camp is hard to swallow and cruelty that comes with the package is not for the faint of heart. This is where the best scenes take place, especially those who are into character-driven movies. This is where the performers truly exhibit themselves so that they can get Oscar recognition. And the harsher the conditions the better. Like a blessing in disguise for the viewers. It's quite astounding that the characters come to life as we are invested in the main three characters (and a few supporting ones) become more fascinating as they develop. I was very pleased that Hayakawa was made into a great character, a lesser made film would've dismissed him into a one dimensional cartoon like villain. Lt. Col. Nicholson is a dedicated officer who's by the book persona gives him that edge of a true leader in his world. He will not budge unless Saito shows more respect towards the Geneva convention in which officers are forbidden to manual labour, in spite of his orders that prisoners in spite of their rank must build this bridge. But when Saito takes the request into consideration or else face ritual suicide, Nicholson goes through great lengths to humiliate the Japanese by upstaging and promoting how great the British Army is buy building a better bridgeIn spite of how proud and dedicated he is towards the British Army, Nicholson is far from perfect, in fact his flaws are quite obvious. His role becomes that of the tragic hero in which even the good guys can get their comeuppance. His character blunder comes from the issue he was fighting against ends up taking over his life as his building of the monument becomes all that matters to him and what the purpose at to why this bridge is being constructed.'Bridge on the River Kwai' works on various levels in terms of great pace, remarkable characters and well put together plot, there is still a major flaw that holds this movie to being a masterpiece. While doing everything in its power to make this war film not emphasizing too much on the war, the last fifteen minutes ends up becoming all about the war and the preachy cliches there are about how bad war is. If they would've kept up with the human drama, this movie could've been pure gold, not that is was overrated. The political sentiments just takes over in the end and when the final quote, 'Madness, Madness' comes around after all the chaos has happened, it leaves a sout taste in your mouth.Many reviewers have said that this movie has anti-war written all over the script and that the after effects of the war can cause even the sanest individual traumatized. No disrespect to the reviewers, but that is not the case. Up until the last 15 minutes it was all about men going out of their ways fighting through hard times during very complicated times. The war was used as a decoy to represent the setting of this film. and even if this film has the anti-war theme stamped all over, they should have kept it more hidden than blurted out in the end which was a cop-out to a potentially reasonable ending.Sure I may be fixated on this flaw too much, but it's because I cared so much bout the movie and director David Lean got lazy and just rushed off the ending too fast making the ending way too inorganic. In spite of this flaw, 'The Bridge on the River Kwai' is a remarkable movie to enjoy and it still holds well as one of the best classic epic films with a great cinematic achievement in character driven movies.",7,1,3,21 May 2018
Edge of Tomorrow," Where Deja Vu Never Looked So Splendid
","It would be quite insincere to label 'Edge of Tomorrow' one of the very best video-game adaptations ever produced, because it actually evolved from a Japanese graphic novel 'All You Need is Kill' by Hiroshi Sakurazaka, but you will be mesmerized by the movie's artistic integrity, the encapsulating structure and the subliminal function and affect, but the source material is what makes this film very special. The story stars Tom Cruise as Major William Cage, a military officer from the future where our entire planet has waged war against an alien invasion in which they're known as Mimics who have dominated pretty much most of Europe. Not much of a fighter, Maj. Cage is an awkward PR guy whose patriotic contributions come in the forum of less interesting things like promoting how great the military life really is and recruiting new soldiers as replacements to those who have been killed in combat. When he rebuffs at the General Brigham's (Brendan Gleeson) command to take charge in the front-lines, he gets badly demoted to private with a meagre chance of surviving the amphibious take-over in Northern France.A strange thing happened on Omaha Beach. The Mimics go on a horrifying and expensive ambush as they attack human forces, whose weaker arsenal of weapons consisting of a mechanized bodysuit is just not enough to take down the much more powerful Mimics. Cage manages takes down a lower-tier alien specie called an Alpha, but gets their blood on him, which whenever he dies, he relives the events which leads to the failed initiative. It's like watching 'Groundhog Day' meets 'Saving Private Ryan' in which Cage must repeat all his steps over and over again until he he can successfully turn the tables around in fighting this almost unbeatable war. Sure it may have the rightful tools needed for another monotonous, mindless, money-swindling action flick. But I was surprised that 'Edge of Tomorrow' is nothing like that at all. The fighting scenes are complimented nicely with some much needed humour with the mystery genre reserved in its place. The film virtually takes off as Cage seeks assistance from a tough, veteran Captain Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt) with whom had the same time-repeating capabilities that Cage has in his possession. Rita toughens up Cage from a wimpy recruit to hardened fighter who might even bring this alien invasion to a close with no assistance. She'll even go as far as to deliver tough love on him in the worst ways possible whenever he's succumbing to grievous bodily harm during the process. With every day passes, Cage is getting stronger, smarter and more powerful enough to send these Mimics packing or being destroyed. Of course for a good story to work, it should go beyond a solid checklist. Not to say that the script by Christopher McQuarrie and the Butterworth brothers compliments to the endless exciting action, but 'Edge of Tomorrow' is still very formulaic and not only does it feel like 'Groundhog Day' or another film with similar formula like 'Source Code' with a very familiar ending to it. However, director Doug Liman manages to use his visual mastery effectively without trying to hold back the tension this movie provides and uses proper manipulative quirks whenever the scenes starts to repeat itself. For a PG-13 movie there's a plethora of off-screen violence. The video game version of this movie sees our hero sporting great engine. In the movie, it provides a stimulating take on a time-jumping military man and never changes the story around. And the lesson that by repeating yourself, you will get better through every baby step you take.",7,0,1,11 May 2015
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Overall It Comes At Hit or Miss
","It must say that I was impressed with the tagline in 'Bram Stoker's Dracula' one that will grab your attention and will keep you at the edge of your seat like any love story that includes tragedy and horror mixed in for good measure. This movie breaks all barriers that stands in the way as we embark on viewing two lovers able to overcome their betrayals no matter how big the consequences are. And unlike some other vampire movies that are not worth mentioning, this one delivers what it promises as it adapts to one of the greatest vampire novels of all time and one novel that you can absorb to while reading it.Set in Romania in 1462, nobleman Vlad Dracula (Gary Oldman) has come home from his victory over the Ottoman Turks to be the victim of bad news as word comes on that his wife Elisabeta (Winona Ryder) has took her own life and her soul can't seek redemption because of her Catholic faith. Angrily, Vlad condemns God, and gains an obsession out of drinking blood that penetrates through the walls. A few centuries later we go back to 1897, London, a young British gentleman named Jonathan Harker (Keanu Reeves) is set to marry his young lover Mina Murray (Ryder) until words come out that his accomplice Mr. Renfield (Tom Waits) has gone loony and has an appetite of eating insects. Harker leaves merry old England to Transylvania to take over Renfield's place as Vlad's client who has a profound interest in real-estate. Dracula has taken interest in the Carfax Abbey and asks Harker for help in the acquisition. Harker feels uncomfortable with the Count and the whole situation as his anxiety goes from bad to worst. But everything was taken care of smoothly and successfully and Harker couldn't have been more relieved. However, Dracula sees a portrait of Mina and believes that she is the incarnate of his lover and now his focus is on taking her back. In return, Vlad makes Jonathan pay by falling prey to the four lady vampires who almost drink out all his blood but keeps him alive due to food shortage. Vlad goes off to London and changes his appearance from a decaying old man to a young man like he was three centuries ago. In London, while passing the time away, Mina awaits for her lover to come back as she spends some quality time with her friend Lucy Westerna (Sadie Frost).Lucy is quite popular with the men as three guys have proposed to her a Texan (Bill Campbell), a physician (Richard E. Grant) and a nobleman (Cary Elwes) whom she chose. When Dracula makes his way to London, he sexually lures Lucy into his trap and takes her off to the living dead. Seeing her strange behavior, that Dr. Abraham Van Helsing (Anthony Hopkins) is called on to see what's ailing her. Vlad thinks now's the time to get his hands on Mina manipulating her into forgetting about Jonathan. I for one thought the Van Helsing character was the most interesting one because he cries out for some much needed humor in this pretty melancholy story which lack in charisma or passion that makes this movie kind of dry at times. The lines given to Vlad and Mina feel like a love scene from 'Dark Shadows' and the relationship between them seem held back. And they never fully reconcile. Once she hears that Jonathan is still alive, they go off to Hungary to get married and coldly gives him a Dear John letter. Who's the bad guy here? The evil blood-sucking vampire or the deceitful ex-lover?I must admit some of the dramatic scenes helped improve Stoker's novel. Mina as Elisabeth's incarnate was very effective to the movie and was handled with care and her being romantically involved with Jonathan and it should have kept that story that way instead of killing them off in the realms of English propriety. Reeves and Ryder were really good in their roles, I'm saddened to say the Oldman fails to impress as the Impaler himself. Sure he looks good for the role, but the lines given to him were pedestrian and not very provocative. Ryder is also guilty in this conviction, but not as bad as Oldman. It's a shame the leads lacked the panache given to the characters, but the supporting players were beyond excellent and it was them who held my interest throughout, though they weren't given much to do. Which is sad because to me this story was like a car that is nice to look at on the outside, but doesn't have that steam to carry on through.",6,0,1,19 October 2010
Die Hard with a Vengeance," The Action Will Surely Make Your Head Spin
","In the 1960's and 1970's in an action film the audience would get their adrenaline rush just by one exciting stunt and would leave the theatre with a smile of satisfaction. By the 1980's and 1990's, the action stunts and explosives are just non-stop you will eventually be looking for an aspirin to cure your migraines. 'Die Hard: With A Vengeance' showcases an explosive action romp that's an action junkies paradise it'll make them hypnotized until the end of days.This third installment to the 'Die Hard' series stars Bruce Willis returning as John McClane who's recently been suspended from the New York police force. We can tell from a scene where the chief shoves his badge across his desk think McClane is back on the prowl. When he acknowledged this analogy, people opened up with a subtle chuckle from action fans who like a little humour to go with the wild ride that's coming to them.After the very authentic looking explosion at a department store in the greater Manhattan area, McClane gets a mysterious call from an evil bomber who goes by the name of Simon (Jeremy Irons), who lures McClane to wear a placard around his body uttering a racial hatred towards African Americans. McClane gets some assistance from a Harlem store owner named Zeus Carver (Samuel L. Jackson) and now he's caught in this sickening mind games by this dastardly Simon.As simple as can be the film is not depended on acting or method. This film relies heavily on stunts, explosives and in your face to make you lose your mind. Simon's whereabouts seem to be omnipresent as McClane and Zeus are roaming all over Manhattan on one deadly mission after another (even going as far as to bum a cab across Central Park). The whole Manhattan Island seems to be infested with bombs, which also includes the subway and even a city school.But Simon's reason for his madness is not just on his own, he has a personal vendetta against McClane and he's not in on this alone. He's come equipped with his own personal army and has vengeance on John for the death of his brother from the first 'Die Hard' movie.Willis and Jackson show some great, reluctant chemistry even though most of their dialogue was saturated with racial undertones and neither man has any kind of racial hostilities. Jackson's use of clever observations and puzzle solving is the perfect foil to McClane's manic live life in danger attitude.Near the end of the chaos were all in awe when the bomb squad members become overwhelmed when a super machine is unraveled that could cause a devastating impact that could cause terror all over Manhattan and the time is ticking fast. There's also the trivializing question of which wire to cut. Simon's plans seem to be pure genius, though it's hard to know how the trucks came to the scenes from Canada. Jeremy Irons is another long list of villains who are British extraction. He joins the faction of Alan Rickman, Tim Roth, Gary Oldman and Sir Anthony Hopkins and his rich, calculating voice has the villainy we can all love to detest.But the acting is overall very secondary as we all come to see our heroes defy death-laden assignments and the excitement will keep you in stitches. We are here to see two men slide from a bridge cable onto a nearby ship, we want to see vehicles topple over like they were Tonka toys. This movie is a kids toy car collection come to life. In the end it just delivers what it promises with a vengeance.On an afterthought, this film was released one month after a real life bombing in Oklahoma City which killed several civilians mostly young school children. As an act of humanity Willis actually refused to make references of this real tragedy in comparison to the bombings. We can respect Willis even more after the closing credits.",7,1,1,2 January 2017
American Gangster," Nowhere Close To a Classic Gangster Flick
","For those who are looking for a equally compelling gangster movie like 'Goodfellas' or 'Donnie Brasco', well keep looking, because 'American Gangster' simply doesn't fit the bill. It's like buying a new car, that looks great on the outside and everything looks like it's in tact. Then when you start, the motor, smoke comes pouring out, the tires become flat, and eventually, the engine dies out. That's how I felt about this movie. The critics hyped about how wonderful this movie is, only to end up with a bag full of nothing. My dismay is in so many locations, I don't know where to start. Right off the band wagon, it was a bad idea from the beginning to let Ridley Scott take the director's seat for this project. His storytelling abilities truly leaves much for him to be desired. A story of this high level should have been handled more carefully,pulling away no stops, with a superb cast of talented performers, this movie had potential to up there with 'The Godfather' and 'Goodfellas'. Within the parameters of 'American Gangster',there are several hooks and angles in the real story, the creative team sorely neglected. For example, Frank Thomas (Denzel Washington) was completely illiterate that even counting seemed foreign to him. Pretty good for a man who has a fortune of over $250 billion. And his way of counting was by scales. So let me ask you, why did Lucas sport a calculator? The relationship between Lucas and his accomplice Bumpy Johnson goes on without any reference. Johnson was one of Harlem's most infamous and well-known residents. Lucas shared an alliance with Johnson for a span of almost 15 years as a loyal and dedicated friend. Johnson was like a second father to Lucas. Other stuff that was ignored includes Lucas' upbringing or how he hired a hit-man to take one of his brother's out. Other side stories that were neglected include his young cousin killed by the KKK or his transition from a petty thug, to a powerful drug-lord. Or even the era when there was time when Harlem was a city you were proud to call home, only to see it crumble under his wing with fear and terror.It was during the 1960's and 1970's that the city of Harlem took a turn for the worst which had potential to be a compelling story. But thanks to the carelessness of the crew, we never get to see the whole picture. These stories plus others should have been there and I hold blame to producer Brain Glazer for not including these stories that I aforementioned. It left me lost in the dark without a clue. It's obvious that no research was done before the filming commenced. I was also appalled that such a talented performer like Cuba Gooding Jr. as the infamous drug lord Nicky Barnes be demoted to just a semi-cameo performance. But he's not the only one who's been let down here. The cast had a strong talent pool and yet they ended up playing mostly watered down performances. No blame to the actors, but to the crew behind this madness. I think the handling of this movie would have been better if Martin Scorsese or Spike Lee took over the directors seat. Then I would have seen potential.Overall this film was far too patted to be a riveting film. The motives behind the crew was that the movie was destined to keep you entertained rather than tracing the story based on fact. The key to great film is sitting at the dinner table with friends and family discussing it with those surrounding you. After this movie was over, my friends and I had nothing to say, because this movie offers just that, absolutely nothing.",4,9,15,19 January 2009
The Mission," Shame That The Oscars Overlooked The Actors In This 1980's Classic
","In the 1980's, it was regarded as the most creative moment in the history of film-making in Hollywood at a time when remakes, reboots and lazy acts of recycling old stories and rehashing them as original content was virtually less commonplace than what's given to us in today's movie market. It was a time where new stories and fresh content was given to its audience and the film industry truly cared about its audience and not wasn't just making movies to leak in the money that we see nowadays. What we see in the movie industry is far cry to the care of the craftsmanship that was truly what made films of the 1980's all the more welcoming in our society.In 1986, under the director who gave us 'The Killing Fields', Roland Joffe brings us 'The Mission' which was nominated for seven Academy Awards including a well deserved win for the Best Cinematography Award by Chris Menges, teels the tale of 18th century Spanish Jesuit priests make it their mission to convert the Guarani Natives in South America, while the Portuguese settlers want to make the Guarani's their slaves. Well-intended Jesuit priest Father Gabriel (Jeremy Irons) peacefully makes its his mission to persuade the Natives to the Catholic faith. One such recruiter is a rebellious ex slave owner and mercenary named Rodrigo Mendoza (Robert De Niro) who's seeking redemption after committing to the murder of own brother Felipe (Aidan Quinn) over jealousy and by becoming a vigilante to the Natives after they forgave him for his evil ways in the past. He eventually joins the priesthood under the tutoring of Father Gabriel.Everything runs smoothly at first until both the Spanish and Portuguese governments intervene making a standpoint at which continents they want to make their own and what was at once a Spanish colonization has now been governed and taken over by the Portuguese which is the more of two evils for the Guarani because they'll more likely be used as slaves. This is where Cardinal Altamirano (Ray McAnnally) comes in as a Papal emissary who's there to figure out whether the Vatican will go with the mission or sell the Natives to the Portuguese for slavery.When I first saw it, I thought to myself the shooting locations must've hit some rough patches being that the locations were surrounded by rivers, deep forestry, and all the beauty that comes from the Amazon jungles of South America. In spite of the outer beauty, the outdoor filming can be very unpredictable and can be dangerous. But hats off to cinematographer Chris Menges for keeping the background beautiful and the setting very authentic. This is a well earned Oscar win for Menges.One can also not ignore the wonderful soundtrack by Ennio Morricone. And while the soundtrack is beautiful in its delivery and has been praised by critics, I felt there were times when the score didn't fit well in some scenes in the movie. Like in the opening act, the soundtrack felt like the music would've been more suited for a thriller genre than a period piece drama. And while the music is something we could easily hum to, there are just some awkward moments where the music doesn't quite match to the emotions of certain scenes. In fact the score is so over-the-top, it awkwardly feels like a soundtrack you could hear in the cartoons. But the more tender scenes fortunately, feature more nuanced tones that one could mesmerized to.It was quite sad that the Academy Awards overlooked the performances by the cast, because each of the performers brought something to the table. Irons shows great subtlety as Father Gabriel, who feels that his mission to convert the Natives to Christianity should be handled peacefully and not for them to break their traditional ways. Likewise, Robert De Niro is wonderful as the redemptive but hot-headed Mendoza. Aside from his rebellious demeanour, De Niro also plays a very physically straining performance as during his quest for redemption, he has the complex task of walking among the muddy trails while being attached to heavy metal. Of the actors performed here, there was one who got some recognition come award season. Ray McAnnally did go on to win the Best Supporting Actor at the BAFTA awards for his role as the self-conflicted but very subtle Cardinal Altamirano.",8,1,1,16 November 2019
Hancock," The Effort is There But The Delivery is Lackluster
","When I write a negative review, I don't just point fingers as who's to blame for the failure of a movie. The movie was just average to say the least. I'm not trying to be mean or cynical, I enjoy the superhero genre movie, 'Iron Man', 'The Incredible Hulk' and whatnot. This movie 'Hancock' had new twist on the superhero genre, a superhero that doesn't want adulation from others. Unfortunately, the pieces of the puzzle unsuccessfully connected, it was mostly due to the lack of direction of where it wanted to go. At first it was hilarious, then it shifts to touching and sentimental and to just plain old vulgar. It never once made up it's mind. Will Smith is the king of summer blockbusters, and I have a lot of respect for him. In 'Hancock', he does all that he could to spark one's interest as the title character, even if the plot does not do him any justice. Charlize Theron is an extremely talented performer, but with her ability I found her sadly out of her league here. Jason Bateman also did an amazing job as the PR guy to the title character. It wasn't a terrible film, and really would've been an refreshing turn on the genre, but there were leftover pieces behind and the full picture never developed. The movie was supposed to aim towards a general audience where both kids and adults could enjoy. But that theory was shattered because of the continual swearing. I don't mind when a character throws in an odd four letter words once in while when the time is needed. But when it becomes the regular protocol to say it through every sentence, it's enough to make you cringe.Though it wasn't a terrible film, I enjoyed the laughs and the action was thrilling, it just wasn't executed like the way it should've. If they make a sequel, maybe another director should be in order. Just a suggestion, you may thank me for it!",6,0,4,19 April 2010
Bring It On," Too Much Language and Sexual References Can Be Off-Putting
","After watching 'Bring It On', I was aghast at finding out that this film was rated PG-13. The reason for my analogy was that this movie may have opened up a plethora of films of this magnitude, this movie could have been inches away from being rated R if not for them taking out the sexuality or even the nudity for that matter.I'm really saying this movie was entirely bad, it was fun to the point of being a guilty pleasure, but the demographics this film has an appeal to is towards the younger teenage demographics by contrast to the older age demographics. I might be getting old before my time, but if you want to show a film about cheer-leaders in their appealing clad apparel, utilizing sexual references through their dialogue, at least let it be towards higher education students. That way they can talk like that, get naked and make out with their lovers. Kirsten Dunst stars Rancho Carne High School student Torrance Shipman who has now been appointed as Captain of their squad, The Toros. They have been an excellent squad except they've been duplicating their moves from an East Compton inner-city squad known as the Clovers. The Clovers are now heading out to the competition and Torrance gets reassurance from the rival squad who hires a choreographer to teach them new moves only to humbled at the regional contest when another team usurps them into doing their moves before they had a chance to compete. But before they surrender, there is still three weeks left for the Toros to rectify from their humiliation to compete in the nationals (they get a free pass on account of how good they are the previous years). Torrance motivates her squad to collaborate and to come up with moves so that they can get revenge and to smoke the competition off its feet. We also are treated to the schmaltzy boyfriend went off to college and there's a new boy in town story thrown in for good measure, along with the heated exchanges with the inner-city kids, there's the climactic question of is it cool to play fair or to cheat puzzlement and the homophobic question if male cheerleaders are gay? So while there are tons of subplots, the cramming is very limited. If that's not enough, these kids seemed to have lost virginity at 13 years old because they seem to be experienced it and insinuate in the duration of the film. Sure I like seeing competitive films about going against the odds overcoming the hurdles, even I found myself cheering during the competition, it was an enjoyable chick-flick. And though teens will likely indulge in a movie of this magnitude, but the overwhelming sexual references could've easily been omitted. And though the one- liners were laughable, still the Junior Highs will likely ask their parents the definition of 'cheer sex'.If they would have cleaned up the overly utilized sexual innuendos and made it more about competition and the training leading up to it, then this movie would've been 10x better. Hell make them college students and that would appeal to older teens and twenty year-old people then it wouldn't have been so bad. If the cinematic community had the gonads they should implement an R rating. Everything about this movie worked.From the competitive scenes to the love story and the bickering is believable and the teen angst is spot on. It's just a bit too dirty for my liking. The R rating should have been placed on the package.",6,1,2,29 February 2016
Defiance," A Potentially Good Story Gets Watered Down Badly
","Based on factual events, 'Defiance' tells the story of three Jewish brothers from Poland, who succeeded in usurping the Nazis as they hideout from them in the deep forests along with other Jewish refugees as they settle into the Belarusian forests along with other Jewish recruits as they hide and prepare to defend themselves against the Nazis or any other anti-Semite groups wanting to have them terminated. Better known as the Bielski Partisans was defined as the most largest and successful Jewish factions who stood up against Nazi rulings and held their own in succession. It was quite peculiar though that when the filmmakers led by director Edward Zwick arrived on the scenes, they were surprised to discover that the local residents currently living have forgotten about such a tale and even more baffling was that there were were no Jewish people living there. Zwick leads his audience to explore how they survived, how they organized themselves, how their ethics were questioned and how their anecdotes can be narrated by melodrama. I will have to say that 'Defiance' has all the essential tools to fit the criteria of a deeply emotional WWII Holocaust story. However, I felt a bit disconnected with the story mainly because the emphasis was more focused on the characters within the group as opposed how they're going to take down the Nazis. The Nazis were the prominent threat to the Jewish refugees like in the 2004 film 'The Village'. Do the Nazis have to be the primary narrative for this film to work? Not necessarily, but the film gets bogged down when personal conflicts, issues and romantic interludes that at times feels more like a reality show, that just lacks the vital substance that the far superior 'Schindler's List' had to offer. It just feels more like a WWII survival story with some sporadic moments of Nazi in pursuit of finding these resistors and destroying the foundations they created. The action outside the surface of the trailers are also very meagre. The survival story here can depict any kind of period of time. In our darkest hours into our future, we may have to hideout in forests to survive. It would be grand if we had someone like the Bielski brothers there to help us if needed. They were farmers who were lethal, resourceful and adept at fighting skills and just great people to lead through difficult situations. The Bielski brothers are oldest one Tuvia (Daniel Craig), the middle one Zus (Liev Schreiber) and the second-youngest one Asael (Jamie Bell) and the youngest one Aron (George McKay). After escaping possible genocide from the Nazis, the brothers retreat into the forest. They're followed by other Jewish people in the surrounding area hiding out and resisting execution as well while the news of their hideout causes an outrage as the Nazis come looking for them. Tuvia the true leader here declares that all Jewish people must hide, even those not fit for fighting. Zus, the enforcer would rather kill Nazis than save the Jewish. The contrasting concepts between both brothers rings true today in Gaza between helping our kind while hurting theirs. The refugee ensemble play pivotal roles in means to survive out here in the wilderness. They learn to feed their families by robbing food, establishing a health clinic for the sick, building a court and even a tanning salon of all things. Sure romance becomes commonplace everywhere, but in a movie that has tension building up to your ears, it really doesn't have a place here in this movie and some are just so implausibly too warm for a film of this magnitude. Craig and Schreiber play their respected roles convincingly and their contrary ways of war versus peace almost gets pretty personal until Zus gives up hope and joins up with the Russian partisans who hate the Jewish just as much as the Nazis. The most interesting character outside the Bielski brothers is an incompetent middle-aged man named Shimon Haretz (Allen Corduner) wants in on the group as they ask what he is known for. Appearing to be in intellect, but his skills have so significance to the partisans, but he's still welcomed to stay. At the time the refugees were predominately cultivators and peasants, while others were handy craftsmen, artists and labourers. If I was in their position what good would I be to them? In many ways there are more Shimon Hartetz's than actual warriors settling there. The best an possibly the most nuanced performance comes from Liev Schreiber. That's because Zus Bielski has his sights set on the real reason they're hiding in the first place. To kill as many Nazis before they strike at them. Daniel Craig is still good Tuvia, as the more peaceful leader, but he's more occupied in being like a mayor and organizing laws and community planning which is necessary, but not logical. So as a Nazi looks by, he notices that the Bielskis had turned their refugee camp into a booming village in the wilderness. As time goes on, it becomes more dire as Nazis and other Anti-Semites were coming from Germany, Russia and Poland. The obey by Soviet forces but can't be hoodwinked. Their efforts succeeded and to this many Jewish people would have never been born had it not been for the Bielski brothers.",7,0,2,2 November 2015
Lord of War," The Acting and Direction Make Up for a Weak Plot
","I remember seeing 'Lord of War' once, but the temptation to go back and look at the scenes and the action was just too hard to resist not seeing it again. The acting by the cast and the direction by Andrew Niccol was pretty good I would've given 'Lord of War' a higher grade, but there were some minor hiccups that lowered my expectations that this is a masterpiece of classic drama. The casting overall was excellent all around. But the real weak link in the movie has to go to the leading actor. Nicolas Cage. Cage lacks in panache and drive for us to get a better comprehension to the character of Ukrainian weapons dealer Yuri Orolov. His accent was not very accurate and no Ukrainian was even spoken. Russian was utilized in the movie, but the on-and -off accent by Cage will miff you when Cage's weak attempt at a Ukrainian accent makes you unconvinced that he is of Ukrainian extraction. Another flaw that shrugged me was that director Andrew Niccol who has impressively reverted back to the trials and tribulations of Russian Cold War dramas, but there is no real Russian language used in the movie as they speak very sporadically in terms of words only to more frequently speak English with a very strong undecipherable Russian accent. Therefore, the culture of the story is not very convincing in spite of the user friendly intentions. The casting was wonderful overall. The one I was impressed with the most was Eamonn Walker's portrayal of Andre Baptiste which is a homage to Liberian Charels Taylor his semi psychotic presence was so chilling it will leave a lasting impression for a long time to come. One of the best props I have ever seen was his son's car which is made of pure gold and has a Kalichnikov. The film's locations and globe hopping in the style of Bond, Bourne and Hunt are so amazing, it gives you the feeling you're being dragged in for the ride. To summarize, 'Lord of War' was an excellent movie that will entertain you very immensely. Sure it wasn't perfect and at times some editing needed some work, but that could easily be forgiven. Even if you're not a action guru, you'll be impressed with memorable acting from the ensemble that deserve our applaud.",7,2,4,8 February 2011
The Terminal," Light Romantic Comedy With Spielberg Like Charm
","Unlike good friend George Lucas who's spent a grand portion of the last two decades fixated on creating more interpretations for pointless 'Star Wars' incarnates like if there was no tomorrow, cohort Steven Spielberg has arbitrarily took different avenues in the film industry to exhibit his versatility as a director and in 'The Terminal' he shows just how dynamic he is as a director and after almost 45 years in the film industry, he still manages to come up with a wide range of topics and enlightens us that there is a world out there besides 'Star Wars'. Just like his previous outing before 'The Terminal', 'Catch Me If You Can', the subject matter has a humble idea brewing along, but the subtlety by Spielberg along with the likable characters make this one like 'Catch Me If You Can' an enlightening character study that will leave you glued to your seat. 'The Terminal' could very much be a comeback to Spielberg's early roots when he used to direct more artsy like films, or he may just be doing light, stylish pictures so that he can prepare himself for his next big-budgeted film 'War of the Worlds'. But for what this movie stands out, we'll just have to sit back and enjoy the ride.Tom Hanks, who has been a favorite performer of Spielberg's stars as Eastern European born Viktor Navorski who came from the fictitious country of Krakoshia and arrives at John F. Kennedy airport in New York City. When he arrives in America he receives the news that his country is embarked in a bloody war and is unsafe to return there. With the government there being overthrown, his country is now just as good as being obsolete which makes Navorski's passport next to nothing. In others he can't go home because he has no home left plus he can't enter America because he has to go through a lot of hurdles to get through. In simpler terms this man has no place to call home to. Viktor's first hurdle he must conflict with is a Homeland Security Officer named Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) who tries to simplify things to our uni-lingual immigrant that in our enter the country, he must have tons of paperwork he must undertake and must be completed. Days have gone by and Krakoshia has not let up and a homeless Viktor has now taken residence at Gate 67, Frank now has dilemma right under his nose. Frank feels the only solution would be is to get himself off the hook and let someone else take the Viktor situation off his hands. He gives Viktor approval to leave the area in praying he'll be incarcerated by the immigration officials. Being raised in Communist born country Viktor is oblivious to the government policies and to just patiently remain at JFK airport. This leads to the expected friction between the uptight Frank and the wedge that Viktor has made himself to be towards Frank. With Frank determined to make Viktor's stay more laborious than one deserves, Viktor progressively befriends several employees at the airport which includes the introverted food service worker named Enrique (Diego Luna) who'll offer Viktor food if he can get more info on a fellow employee he's secretly smitten with named Dolores (Zoe Saldana). His other friends include a cargo handler named Joe (Chi McBride) and a custodial worker named Gupta (Kumar Pallana). Viktor eventually gets a job and gets romantically linked to a flight attendant named Amelia Warren (Catherine Zeta-Jones). The characters depicted here is where the comedy factor is featured and at times it feels at most improvised by the cast which speaks volumes knowing the Spielberg is behind the camera. Hanks does a wonderful job here and captures a sense of likability like one of his most enduring characters in the 1990's namely Forrest Gump. Zeta-Jones has a very limited role here, but she excels well here as love-confused character in a vulnerable position. Normally I cringe when Stanley Tucci ends up playing hateful characters because of his reputation of overacting them. Sure his villainy here is portrayed clichéd, but here he's playing it more subtle and that's refreshing coming from Tucci. Granted Spielberg can overthrow us with overly done schmaltz, but here the schmaltz was limited here and that makes the film all the more enthralling. The characters are low-key but developed enough to get to know them and his light direction doesn't give us any indication that this movie is directed by a legend in his craft. The script was done by 'The Truman Show' writer Andrew Niccol as he succeeds in keeping the script tight with no heavy-handed stuff to catch you off guard while he succeeds in keeping it unconventional. The final scenes feature little surprises that will shock you in some way to the point of refraining from any kind of contrived Hollywood formula. Overall, 'The Terminal' succeeds in being more truthful in showing how developed countries like the United States reacts towards foreigners who want to start a life in this country. The film fends itself nice through the characters and the interactions between them. Its a film that charmingly demonstrates paranoia, insecurity, xenophobia that manifests within the diversity of the American people. This movie can show a sweet side to a rather serious subject without feeling cheated.",8,2,2,13 March 2016
The Shawshank Redemption," Where The Demons Are More Metaphoric Than Figurative
","Under the authorship of the horror king Stephen King, 'The Shawshank Redemption' explores demons, but not the ones that that come at you at stab you with their pitchforks, no these demons are the ones that's hidden in you and finding ways to release them from your soul till eternity. Like his other masterpiece 'Stand By Me', this is not the traditional horror fest that made King a cultural icon. Instead we have an old-school structured prison drama about two life-sentenced convicts who embark on a quest to break free from the isolation of prison to become free or die trying, whichever comes first.Located in the unforgiving atmosphere of the Shawshank prison cells with prisoners coming in by the dozens, the prison walls is just as much of scary place lie the Overlook Hotel only with chains and creaking walls to accompany every unsettling minute that comes about in this place that makes hell look like a tropical paradise. For more added effect, there's a raven that makes his home there and even has a name, Jake who's under the eyes of aging ex-murderer Brooks (James Whitmore) who works as the prison librarian. A lot of the cliches of prison life pays homage to the old-school prison camps with familiar characters like the Bible-preaching tyrant Warden (Bob Gunton) and a no-nonsense, short-tempered prison guard Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown).Starting his career directing B-movies (The Fly II) and forgettable TV movies like 'Buried Alive', this was Frank Darabont's chance to show that he can direct films of a similar calibre like Spielberg or Scorsese by taking a rather old format approach to this prison story to make something refreshingly provocative and authentic at the same time. While observing the hell that is prison life with power-abusive guards, hypocritical Bible-thumping wardens and prison food that comes with a side of maggots, this story could explain things better than King's novella in changing the way we look at things and thank the creator for giving us the freedom we have as we speak.The main emphasis of 'The Shawshank Redemption' is on the progressive friendship involving two prisoners of a large age gap, the former banker tuned convicted wrongfully accused murderer Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) and regretful veteran prisoner Ellis ' Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman). The opening scenes take place in 1947 as Dufresne was found guilty of murdering his wife and her lover and while he's trying to prove he is innocent of all convictions, there is evidence his footprints were at the scene and his irresponsible ways come to full effect as his hands were on the weapon. Andy was sentenced to life in jail where he'll like spend his years in Maine's unforgiving threshold of hell itself, The Shawshank prison. With a hobby that includes, reading, chess and rock-carving and his vast knowledge of finance and commerce, Andy is still a loner and therefore 30 year veteran prisoner Red starts to befriend him.Andy is not some incarcerated imbecile his powerful education and know-how has managed to turn his life for the better. When Captain Hadley was lamenting about tax collectors confiscating most of his inheritance money, Mr. Dufresne makes a negotiation of how Hadley can keep his full inheritance under the condition that they all get three free cold beers after working in the sun all day tarring the foundations on the roof.His knowledge in finance and investments soon begin to change the landscapes of prison life for not only his prison inmates, but for those those hard-nosed people who run the prison system. For the guards he's now filing their taxes while for his inmates he's earned enough money to transform a spider-web infested rundown library into a bigger facility for the inmates to take advantage of. And sure this was done in six years, Andy has become a symbol of perseverance.It's strange that we can watch a movie and be sympathetic to a convicted murderer but his message of determination makes us really care for him and hope that he'll be released anytime soon. That feeling of determination is passed down to friend Red who fears he'll suffer the same fate that Brooks did after being 50 years imprisoned only to lead him to suicide because he felt like a nobody in the real world with no friends or family.In return, Red's offering is the power of clemency. Where Andy fully explains what really happened the night when his wife was killed. He confesses that he does take some responsibility for his wife's death and his asking for forgiveness is that turning point to this very well acted and directed movie.Though sadly snubbed by the Oscars, Tim Robbins' Andy Dufresne evolves from a convicted killer ex-banker to a warm highly-respectable friend. Morgan Freeman gives a warm performance as a veteran prisoner who finds the power of optimism and his narration comes across as purposeful than self-serving like other films he's narrated.In the end, 'The Shawshank Redemption' will likely fill your heads into thanking those around you that you have more freedom than you think in the outside world that should never be taken for granted. It also gives us the feeling that serving time is not the end of the line and no matter where you are if you serve your time wisely you might get rewarded in the long run and that we as humans hold the keys to our own prisons.",10,1,1,25 December 2018
The Conjuring," A Very Fun, But Standard Horror Film
","Usually horror films that claim are actually based on true events, you try your hardest to suspend any kind of scepticism in hopes that there's some form of truth lurking around. In the realms of the supernatural in horror films, I feel there is no need to spoon-feed our audiences any further than offering the material you have in front of our eyes. Are the situations faced in these stories real? There's a possible chance it may be. Is the story itself accurate? More often, they are not. 'The Conjuring' directed by James Wan focuses on a haunted house story and delivers us some powerful, but mundane scares that exceeds above other movies, though the quality is quite lacklustre. The opening ploy involving a possessed doll paves the way open to our leading heroes, a pair of paranormal investigators Ed and Leslie Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga), the story turns its attention to the Perron family lead by Roger and Carolyn (Ron Livingston and Lilli Taylor) who in 1971 move into a condemned farmhouse in Rhode Island with their five daughters and their dog, Sadie. No sooner than they settle in which strange eerie stuff manifests within their surroundings as secret passageways start to unravel and the dog becoming very suspicious, refuses to even come into the house. The hauntings are thrown at them left,right and centre as mysterious bruises appear on their skin, clocks stopping for no reason, doors open by themselves. While these things happen it never feels rushed. Once they had enough, it was time for the Perron's to call the Warren's to investigate the paranormal activities going on in their house.The Warrens eventually move in with the family to seek out what kind of supernatural occurrences is bothering the Perrons so that can gain permission from the Catholic Church to see if they can possibly perform an exorcism on them. Their research leads up the forces behind these evil intentions comes from a lady named Bathsheba (Joseph Bishara) who in 1863 was claimed to be a witch was caught trying to sacrifice her young child. And the movie just carries along with one thing happening after another either cementing the side story or just simply randomizing one scare after the next until we've reached the climax. What makes 'The Conjuring' compelling was the ensemble. As surreal as the story may be at times, they're all very convincing and the emotions they bring to their audience speaks volumes louder than words. Even the daughters, who are relatively unknowns succeed in delivering emotion range that never seems either forced or contrived. When the performers feel the fear factor, the audience will feel it as well. Therefore, for a horror film I felt the performances were actually pretty good. Not Oscar worthy, but the emotional manipulation really sells itself pretty good. The other factor is the level of scares. Sure it's been done a thousand times before for better or worse, but it is quite solid in its execution. The unsettling camera with its off-kilter angles create a spectrum of uncomfortable images and situations like ghosts materializing in the mirrors, eerie whispers, and doors slamming on their own. It's been done before, but the execution here is chilling and convincing. However, the scares seem to only work but only in a subtle fashion and it lacks in terms of having a deep impact on its audience. Director James Wan ignores to develop a more impacted thread that can vibrate with the audience once the end credits are finished. It's something that could be taken into consideration. With the myriad of horror remakes and sequels, it's necessary to have a scene like in 'The Exorcist' implanted into the story. For a film that tries to go beyond the fear factor of the paranormal, 'The Conjuring' fails miserably. The digging for evidence is only depended on mainly for the action and not very much elsewhere. And from what is given to us the Warrens' believe that the Perron's are just another case file. Where do they go after this case has zero concern for us, but some fleshing out could have made this movie a lot better. In an early scene that situates the Warren's lecturing at university students as they would prefer to be either labelled as ghost hunters or kooks. I think kooks best describes them. Although it feels as though the movie was based or inspired by actual events, but suspending one's disbelief seems to be the direction this movie is going. There's a lot of traditional horror elements that these kooks won't tell.",7,2,2,8 September 2014
Platoon," Strong Film With Some Flaws
","For a rather powerful film, this movie seems permanently stuck in the 1980's. It's still very much a trend setter that inspired other war themed films to follow even though they have emulated the theme of war, it can never fully be duplicated. Yes, 'Platoon' still succeeds in capturing the fear, the unpredictability, and the uncertainty that comes into effect when you're in the war. However, Oliver Stone's other war themed follow-ups become more stylized in contrast to the substance that this film delivers. The visceral effects seems to be more personal due to the horrors director Oliver Stone faced during his time in Vietnam. The characters depicted here have the emotions to convince you that these soldiers are fearing their lives and know they can come out of this war as heroes or dead.Charlie Sheen stars here as Chip Taylor, a college flunky from a posh upbringing arbitrarily enlists into the military feeling that the underclass should not be the only ones fighting in the Vietnam War, which shows little significance towards his allies who accurately says that only the rich could convey such an attitude. Sheen doesn't have the impression or the range as Taylor from the inexperienced novice to grizzled veteran he never sparks any kind of adequacy which makes this movie very distracting.As times strolls on, Taylor becomes more respected by his troop who ignores the fact that other new recruits won't make it out alive and we grow onto them which is something the audience never really does. The platoon has two superior sergeants who they admire. We have a scar-faced mean-tempered tyrant Barnes (Tom Berenger) and the more level-headed but effective commando Elias (Willem Dafoe). Berenger excels quite well as the brutish leader who seems like he was born into this lifestyle and may not adjust well to civilian life. Both Berenger and Dafoe were nominated for Best Supporting Actors at the Oscars, only to be humbled by Michael Caine for 'Hannah and Her Sisters'.Barnes and Elias's friendship falls out when the borderline insane Barnes threaten to kill a Vietnamese lady who may or may not be helping Viet Cong fighters which eventually leads to a divinity within the platoon which Taylor likes to awkwardly describes as a 'civil war'.The loose formatting of 'Platoon' we see a cornucopia of unrelated occurrences of grunts and the endless chatter about how how long before their tour of duty will come to a conclusion. The movie lures into the daily regiments that the soldiers go through in their endless quest for survival. The battles with the enemy is illustrated with realism along with the constant reminder that heroism or death are the only options in this war. The physical and psychological wounds is vintage in terms of storytelling. But Stone's choice of music is highly questionable. The 'Adagio of Strings' song feels out of place and it more or less hinders the scenes as opposed to contemplating them.The narration by is seen from Taylor's letters to his grans must've been giddy over his cheery sentiments about if his sanity is in tact or his doubts of making it in his war. His diary looks like it was written by a Junior High student coping with anxieties rather than a man in the middle of what is threshold of hell. Elias' death tends to be vastly overplayed loosely inspired by the 1968 picture of the soldier aiding a helicopter to the ground which runs its welcome.The strong points in 'Platoon' that's handled well is the stress of these average soldiers face when heading to the front line. The Viet Cong are depicted as semi invisible ghosts using their mind games to inject fear is handled very convincingly. So when the scene where the platoon invades a village and destroys it an annihilates the people serves a purpose. In the midst of battle, we see the fear, the pressure and the determination in which leads the troop to the brink of madness. It is a reminder to the environment in which these soldiers are facing and is an open invitation of what could happen if we were in their situations.",7,0,0,9 January 2017
Blow," Like Goodfellas and Scarface Combined
","'Blow' can almost be compared to 'Goodfellas' with the exception to the immaculate clothing and the shiny shoes. It has a bit of 'Scarface' going for it sans the over-the-top accents. But what this movie has in common from the aforementioned two is that the drugs and the profits are piling on and the humanity is rapidly materializing into one huge mess. From the luscious, warm sunny California sun, to the cold, hard clink of the prison walls, director the late Ted Demme follows the career of George Jung (Johnny Depp) as he becomes one of the leading distributors of cocaine in the United States. Depp took the role by force as Demme felt confident that he was the right man for the job.His journey was filled with excitement which at the cost came several obstacles in his pursuit of happiness. The more fame he got, the more we see Jung slowly deteriorate in a malignant human being. The most fascinating thing about this movie is the way that Jung lingers on to remain sympathetic especially through these very complex times. He makes poor decisions, he doesn't fully commit to his relationship with his daughter Kristina (Emma Roberts and Jamie King), has no use for his father Fred Jung (Ray Liotta who was the best performer here and the more likable character portrayal) and yet through all his flaws, we still care for this anti-hero. George's rise to demise can be very hard to watch at times and the heartbreaks can leave an after-effect on its audience. The narration from Depp isn't coming from Depp's mouth but from a perpetual observer, we see Jung in a different light, a light coming from a relatively bad person who's still finds time to care for him as we sit back in grief as we watch the foundation of his mind progressively crumble.His words of wisdom going from being the happiest man alive to being one of the most miserable can be all summed up to what this film's about. Here's a man at his wit's end coming from the worst luck in the world after living going through a hellish ride with poignant features to go with it. His pride and his ambition became his biggest liability which landed in him a 60 year jail sentence. The film is not presented in a cynical way saying that dreams and wishes lead to one's demise, far from that. It's telling us these things happen to all of us in some point in our lives and it demonstrates that just how vulnerable and frail we our as humans and how everyone is capable of causing pain and destruction to ourselves and to other people. It's telling us that George Jung was a jerk and now it caught on to him. However, even people who are not necessarily jerks have fell into dark or even darker holes that Jung has faced. It could happen to anyone who is not careful so all I'm saying is be careful in how you live your life and prevent all obstacles in your way.So instead of looking at George Jung as an evil druggie, Demme succeeds in making Mr. Jung into a very flawed individual who let fame get to his head oblivious as to what the costs that come with this unexpected rise to fame. During the closing sequences of 'Blow', I held my hand to my heart in sorrow. Here was a man who was once a father, a son, and we see everything taken away at him due to his dreams and careless abandon. And even as the movie ends, his spirit wanders on aimlessly and speaks more volumes than the movie itself and in the end his action have faded and his presence is darkened.",7,0,0,2 December 2013
The Silence of the Lambs," Two Thumbs Up For This One
","Jodie Foster stars as FBI Agent Clarice Starling who's on a mission to track down a homicidal maniac, but only the sneering cannibal Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) is the only person who knows his whereabouts. But his presence is luring and quite intimidating so getting into his head shouldn't be an option. With supreme intelligence like Stephen Hawking and diet that will put Jeffrey Dahmer to shame, Lecter has the delight in manipulating his victims through his diabolical mind games.Kindly, Lecter obliges to Clarice in helping with her investigation if she joins him in his little web of mind games. but the catch is she must reveal her personal background about her and he'll do the same. The horror genre in the movie isn't some dark, scary macabre individual going on a joyful killing spree, but a chilling, manipulative supremely intellectual individual who's desires is to play games with the medulla oblongata. He's got the gift of smelling one's fears and knows exactly where to strike at you, psychologically. There's even a good chance that the psychopath Agent Starling is after might even be twice as crazy as Lecter. But Lecter's motives are so convincing and executed to perfection by Sir Anthony Hopkins that the room temperature in the theater got a bit colder than usual.With the instincts of a snake, Lecter starts then starts to slurp. Hopkins later reveals it was improvised just to add more intimidation to the character. This role as Dr. Lecter brought this relatively unknown British actor exceptional fame and Hollywood started to take more notice from this middle-aged performer. Lecter himself has identical similarities to Boris Karloff's 1934 movie 'The Black Cat' in which Karloff plays a demonic Satanist. Instead of making Lecter an evil, ghoulish monster who goes on a killing spree, he takes the Norman Bates route and plays a monster in the form of a sophisticated gentleman. Sure he gladly helps Clarice, but at cost of haunting her as well. Sure he's not as bad as we are lead to believe, but you can't help taking your eyes off the screen when he comes on.What was fortuitous about the release of 'The Silence of the Lambs' was released at the time cold-blooded cannibal/serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer was making the headlines. Both stories were quite identical to one another as they both lured their audience with gripping and chilling effects. Therefore, it is safe to say that 'Silence of the Lambs' gets us into sorting out connections to find a convincing explanation as to what drove Dahmer to be the way that he is. Unlike other psychological thrillers, this one will have you pondering to yourself over what kind of connection this movie has to the Dahmer story. The real shortcoming here is that audience at the time wanted more, as in more Hannibal. Well it took 10 years in the making and in 2001 'Hannibal' was released. And even though Dahmer is rotting in hell, Hannibal will live on into ours minds forever.",9,1,1,22 February 2011
Any Given Sunday," Went On Way Too Long But Otherwise Very Good
","Though very clever in its delivery, 'Any Given Sunday' was overly dependent in its production team. While the movie itself is quite observant in terms of showcasing the dramatic moments quite effectively, there are moments where the action moments have an MTV like atmosphere going for it which can be distracting. Ay least the underlying story is implemented into the plot.With the emphasis of football, the casual viewers will know what to expect coming into seeing this movie. We learn the unpredictable futures that worry veteran quarterbacks, and how injuries have an impact on players who are more willing to take risks of their own being just to get back into the game. Or how an inexperienced rookie who has a moment in the public eye gets in their heads and turns them into jerks. Even going so far as to give us the impression that ESPN newscasters are just self-promoters, and that owner's wives are inebriates and that precocious daughters know more about football than their fathers and that coaches become spiritual gurus when the games are not in their favour. And that the closing moments of important games end with some last minute exciting play.These features offer nothing new to the sports movies of all, but director Oliver Stone and the performers give character to each scenario and the dialogue has an effect to the story. Al Pacino shines as the cranky smoky voiced crank Tony D'Amato who is dedicated in coaching the Miami Sharks from being a zero to becoming state champions as he's joined by top notch performers. We know that all the pivotal scenes are unoriginal and the cliches are spread everywhere.Jamie Foxx joins the fray as rookie quarterback Willie Beamen who has the opportunity to shine as his superior quarterbacks have been carried out due to injury. With his lack of experience he gets so overwhelmed he starts vomiting on the field, but then eventually becomes an overnight sensation. Foxx goes through all the changes in his character professionally from unsure rookie, to cocky celebrity, to becoming demanding all in one swipe.The original owner of the team was a legend of the game who hired D'Amato as a game of chance, but then the owner dies and passes the legacy to his daughter Christina Pagniacchi (Cameron Diaz) while her mother Margaret (Ann-Margaret) is never shy of consuming martinis. Sure this movie will attract the male audience, we know the women will not feel at place in this world. And though Margaret knows it, Christina feels she knows better about football than the coaches and players. Christina thinks by moving this franchise under her lead will bring money to her pockets, her mother never felt inspired by the game and has steered clear.Dennis Quaid is effective as the star quarterback Jack 'Cap Rooney who's fatal injury has led him in a world of great uncertainty. At one point he contemplates retiring only to get aggressively persuaded by his wife Cindy (Lauren Holly). The sad part about 'Any Given Sunday' is that even though it clocks at 2 hours and 45 minutes long, there's very little room for its enormous cast. James Woods and Matthew Modine have good support as team physicians with contrasting view about players who have career threatening positions and Lawrence Taylor shows strong acting as a veteran player who won't step down unless he gets his bonus. And then there is plethora of familiar faces like Charlton Heston, LL Cool J, Bill Bellamy and Johnny Unitas as a rival coach.The lacking elements to this movie is due to the smoke and mirrors approach the story has to offer. There's no telling of what the team does to prepare their ways of winning or understood by those who aren't familiar with the rules of the game. Stone depends mainly on closeups of their vibrant uniforms and the rough action sequences and the in-your-face sound effects. It's all done without reason or to get invested into the characters.There's a lot of music in the movie which promotes an unconvincing video that Foxx is in. It was like Stone was desperate for attention so he decided to crank up the tunes to succeed. There was a lot of ground to be covered but it was all stretched out while throwing in random unknown players tackling every player they see fit and adding music as a distraction to make casual viewers to ease their minds and not worrying if get dazed and confused.Though not a completely bad movie, it's still recommended and the dramatic scenes were worth your time. Pacino shows great acting talent and his pep talks are quite inspirational especially with Quaid and Foxx. The script was both warm and witty by Oliver Stone and John Logan. Though I never complain too much of the length of the movies I watch I think if they cut the film to two hours maximum it would have been better.",6,0,1,27 August 2019
Iron Man," An Experience of a Lifetime
","Of the top, my all time favourite superhero movie is the 1989 Batman, and my second favourite was the 1994 Alec Baldwin superhero movie 'The Shadow' (the other ones seem to lack a certain formula that doesn't appeal to me very well).Not trying to be picky, but for a superhero film to work, isn't quite necessarily based on the excitement, the colours, the special gift our hero possesses or the colourful villains. It's fundamental priority is centered around the person behind the costume, the humanly characteristics our hero portrays. That in itself lures me into watching superhero action films. The superhero persona is only the frosting on the cake as to what drives the person behind the goals the character wishes to accomplish and the tactics he/she possesses and the dangers they encounter along the way of their quests.'Iron Man' is an inspiration of how superhero movies should be made. The man behind the robot, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) suit represent raw emotion, real characterizations and a drive behind his motives. In addition to that, he is fun-loving, intelligent with just the right amount of quirkiness that is over-blown serious or overly silly. A great trait about the movie is that it isn't forced or rushed into the action scenes right away. 'Iron Man' starts with the story behind Tony Stark and gradually it builds up the action. That way, it makes room for more further development as the story progresses. We can easily observe the dilemmas that Tony Stark is faced with and what he plans t do to overcome the obstacles that are upstaging him. Unlike other superhero films with cheesy dialog, in 'Iron Man' the acting is surprisingly excellent. Downey is born to play this complex character, and succeeds rather well with his usual wit and low-key acting. It is by far the best I've seen since Michael Keaton in 'Batman' and that was almost 20 years ago. His Tony Stark and the hardships he faces is convincing enough to sympathize with.Gwyneth Paltrow turns in another compelling performance as Tony Stark's loyal aide Pepper Potts. She provides a certain kind of charm and kindness that isn't just the female lead. Her facial expressions of concern and bewilderment speak more volumes than her voice (though her dialog was excellent too). Terrence Howard shines as Col. Rhodes, but I would've liked him to have more air time and better interactions between him and Stark, that might be my only criticism there. Plus Jeff Bridges is wonderful as the villain Obadiah Stane. The special effects are amazingly stunning in a way that it doesn't usurp the dialog like in many superhero moves. It succeeds in it being even balanced and avoids the cheese factor immensely. Last year I went to the theaters expecting to see another cheap-thrilling superhero action blockbuster, boy it was one of those rare moments where I was glad I was wrong. It was everything I ever hoped for in a superhero movie. Especially the development of the man behind the suit rather than the Iron Man himself. Stay tuned next year folks, the long-awaited sequel is coming soon. Get your tickets while they last. Get that camera rolling Jon Favreau.",9,8,12,20 April 2009
Casino Royale," Two-Wods Decribe This Bond Movie Bo-Ring
","There's always a rush in the air when a new James Bond film enters the theater. This movie is equally exciting as watching cheese mold. It has an action-packed beginning while in location in Madagascar. The very well-balanced bad guy on the run from Bond through a construction area, destroying everything in his path, the crane scene was quite remarkable and the actions gave us the promise of another exciting action-packed 007 film. But instead we are treated to low-brow Bond women who provide something for the eyes, but nothing else in between, which pales in comparison to the other Bond movies 44 years before this one. The villain's blind eye bleeds is disturbing and at times it is too gross. The villain's mission is to obtain money at a gambling resort where the contestants must ante up $10 million and the winner keeping the loot all to themselves. The plot is average at best,but the chemistry between Bond (Daniel Craig) and Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) is almost non-existent, which dries up the whole Bond story. When they appear on screen together, all the action drains out a lot and the romantic story comes into place demoting the action flick into a semi-action flick. Craig shows what he's truly of acting wise in an airport scene where Bond prevents a huge plane from getting off the ground. I was eagerly awaiting for Q to show up and show Bond another one of his/her kooky gadgets. But not in 'Casino Royale'. No Q, no gadgets. Instead we're treated to a serenade of Judi Dench's M moan and groan and has no feel for the movie at all. Lady Dench, stick to period pieces. Many other scenes just drag on keeping your finger on the fast forward button. I don't mean to sound harsh, the intentions to keep up with the modern stage and keeping up the traditions to the Ian Fleming novel is no piece of cake. 'Quantum of Solace' was an improvement from 'Casino Royale', it's just that in the James Bond movies is either a hit or a miss. This one is an unfortunate miss. The long scenes almost put me to sleep (fortunately I wasn't too far from the coffee kettle at the time). The first half hour were some of the bests moments in 'Casino Royale'. But then, it just faded gradually along the way. It's a shame, really.The Casino fights is poorly choreographed and not very accurate. You have the baddies kicking Bond's ass and Bond fighting back. From the bond films of long ago, (especially the Roger Moore era), the fight scenes were campy, but at least the Bonds of yesteryear's features an unsympathetic Bond. This sweet and sensitive Bond made me cringe. The locations were fun to watch, it was the banal acting and the incoherent chemistry with the Bond women that forces us to search elsewhere for a super-spy movie who relies on his resources to outshine the evil-doers, with nifty gadgets that leaves you with a satisfying aftertaste begging you to watch this movie again. You know what? Keep looking! You won't find it here. It had real good premise but failed miserably in many places. If you must, see it at least once, but don't expect much.",5,3,5,6 January 2009
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," Entertaining, But Not Historically Accurate
","'Elizabeth: The Golden Age' tells the tale of veteran ruler Elizabeth I (Cate Blanchett) at the fear of being overthrown by the powerful King of Spain Philip II (Jordi Molla) as he's on a crusade to declare full Catholic dominance in Europe in hopes that his young daughter becomes the new Queen of England. Meanwhile the scheming Mary Queen of the Scots (Samantha Morton) has plans of her own to dethrone Elizabeth by throwing her into her prison. When Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen) returns from England after spending years in the New World, Elizabeth becomes enthralled by his presence as well as her lady in waiting Bess (Abbie Cornish). Chief Adviser Sir Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush) continues to negotiate with the court affairs as he listens in on Mary's evil plots. Mary's demise was the perfect foil for Philip to release the infamous Spanish Armada in hopes to overthrow Elizabeth as the Queen of England. 'I know I have the body of a weak and feeble woman; but I have the heart and stomach of a king, and of a king of England too; and think foul scorn that ... Spain, or any prince of Europe should dare to invade the borders of my realm; to which rather than any dishonour shall grow by me, I myself will take up arms, I myself will be your general, judge, and reward of every one of your virtues in the field.' This was the words of encouragement Her Majesty as she gathers her troops in Tilbury to take down the Spanish Armada in 1588. This 'Golden Speech' is one of the most quotable words in British history that's up there with the many that was said by Shakespeare and Churchill and that neither Hollywood can ever botch or paraphrase those famous words. No matter how hard they try. In 1998, I had the chance to see 1998's 'Elizabeth' directed by Shekhar Kapur and my reaction was that is was incredibly stunning, but I had some issues with the pacing and I didn't really like Joseph Fiennes. In spite of those shortcoming it had plenty of Academy Awards nominations and other accolades to its credits. Nine years after that, they made the much anticipated sequel which is emphasizing on Elizabeth I and her relationship with Raleigh and the Religion Wars with Spain. From my knowledge I read that the Spanish couldn't get through because the English bays were not overly deep enough and the usages of fire ships and were also problematic. Strange as it seems, but Britain has been spared many times thanks to the waters surrounding the little country. Even their biggest ships were overturned due to excess stacking and abysmal weather conditions. As for the film itself the costumes were quite gorgeous, but the historical inaccuracies were way overwhelming. Whether it's the fictionalized homicidal attempt by gunpoint, or the uses of historical locations, the undermining of Sir Walter Raleigh and the condemning of the Roman Catholic Church, the misconceptions in the motives of Mary Stuart and the Spanish as a whole, the falsifying will likely scratch the heads of any historical fanatic. On the entertaining level, it is quite satisfying and will keep you on the edge of your seat, but the Spanish Armada is overwrought with a tedious montage sequence proceeded by an unorthodox shot of Elizabeth standing in a hallway. The entertainment value is pretty good and should leave a positive impression to the open public (not as good the first installment), however is there another reason why we should see another retelling of Elizabeth's life? I mean she's making more screen appearances than Abe Lincoln who seems to be in everything. One of the things that underwhelmed me about this movie was the lack of a grandeur epic moment. This sequel should've been flooded with highlights to usurp the predecessor, but with the exception of the Armada, this film was watered down badly. I guess the scene that caught my eyes was the one involving Philip II of Spain. Not because of the green hue or his personality as a cowering religious radical, but the peculiar ways the shots were handled. Which also includes the rather obscene dance scenes ever shot on film. Acting wise the supporting cast seemed underdeveloped, but Blanchett shows her true dominance as a leading performer. Even though this movie was very flawed, historically inaccurate and not overpowering in its delivery, this sequel is still strongly entertaining to watch if you like costume dramas, but if you want historical accuracy, it would better if you just read about in textbook.",6,2,2,23 November 2015
The Deer Hunter," One to Actually See To Be Intrigued
",".In order for you to fully understand the concepts of 'The Deer Hunter', you have to watch it carefully to get the feel of the movie. May I remind you before I continue my review, this movie is a three hour epic. So with that that in mind those who have short attention spans, it's never too late to turn away now, but if those who can sit through the slow, progressive pace with patience and perseverance, this is truly a treasured movie for the ages. Back in the late 1970's there have been an influx of epic movies that went past the three hour mark. Even though the movie caters to a general audience, it's really not custom-made for everyone to enjoy. It has a cornucopia of genres thrown into the story like romance, drama, mystery, horror and most of all the triumphs and turmoil of the Vietnam War that was still haunting the United States even though the war ended three years before 'The Deer Hunter' was released. Sure the facets of the film was centred around the concept of friendship, it also gave an insight of the Vietnam War and the physical and mental harm it affected the soldiers who fought in this war.The images captured in 'The Deer Hunter' was extremely believable. There is no Hollywood concocting or glorifying the dreadful events of the Vietnam War and it doesn't have any artistic merit to the movie though the cinematography is quite sublime. The story often balances of congruency and at the same time it's off its kilter. The characters' development are not entirely coherent as there's little background provided for them and the psychological aspects are not very fulfilling either. What it does have is strong connections to the relationship of the characters which is based on friendship as each deserve our sympathy after what they've experienced during the Vietnam War. There's a lot of shock-value in the story and of course the one that sticks out is the infamous Russian Roulette scenario which was real and quite memorable in a not so good way.Robert DeNiro plays the leading role as Michael Vronsky, an introverted individual who only speaks if there's something that needs to be said and is smitten by a young lady named Linda (played by a young Meryl Streep). Linda plans on marrying Nick (Christopher Walken), who's friends with Mike while their other friend Steven (John Savage) and his new wife Angela (Rutanya Alda). The triad celebrate their enlisting into the Vietnam War. Meanwhile three other friends named Axel (Chuck Aspegren), Stanley (John Cazale) and John (George Dzundza) request to stay behind in the semi-condemned small town of Clairton, Pennsylvania as they anticipate their return. The alliance have quite a few similarities to one another. They all work in steel factory, they enjoy the sport of deer hunting and they all love a harmonious drink of beer. Again director Michael Cimino focuses on the realism of the settings and the characters. There are times when the movie has a few scenes where little action happens and are not in sync with the plot, but as long as they keep it real, is what makes it all the more settling.And just like you would expect on the effects of people who fought during the Vietnam War, psychological scarring takes place and the bonding of friendship begins to falter. The good moments are lost in the carnage as the friends try to rectify what was once the balance that brought them together. Michael is the balance of the scale as he tries to piece together the foundation of the three friends, but he could only do so much even though he deserves an 'A' for effort. And the more he tries to be the peacemaker of the triad, the more frustrated he becomes as he can find no way to mend this once strong friendship that has now crumbled. Nick has become a shell of his former self as he's now become a prisoner of war for all to see. Steven is now a cripple and is now institutionalized by his wife. In the meantime, Linda has become a lost soul and just wants to be with a man to seek comfort with. The emotions are sad but they play off very gratifying.In all due sincerity, 'The Deer Hunter' is anything but entertaining. You must be in a certain position of mind when to look for the engaging scenes and which scenes to fast-forward to. If you're like me who liked the movie, please watch again for stuff you may have missed. And for those who can't sit through a three hour epic (nothing bad not everybody can) then maybe this is not the movie for you. There's a lot of gripping stuff that demands our viewing.",9,0,3,18 February 2013
Identity," A Thrill Ride With Lots of Substance
","As of late, one of the things that irks me about thriller films is that it offers lots of style and nothing more in between. Thankfully 'Identity' isn't one thriller that fits in that category as it provides for you a compelling dark and provocative story, complimented by an ensemble of talented performers and an atmosphere that will likely send chills up and down your spine.The story takes place in a cramped little motel on a dark and dreary night. Ten strangers show up in the motel who may have been brought here by coincidence or does their presence stem much further than that? They think they're safe in this cozy little motel, but then they gradually discover that one-by-one, several people were getting hacked left, right, front and centre What may seem like it's just a crazed murderer on the prowl just randomly killing people for kicks, the boiling point goes far more macabre than any of the individuals could imagine. Were these strangers chosen randomly or did they know that they were doomed from the start? Granted, I had my doubts when I first saw 'Identity' in the theatres nine years ago. I thought it was just another mindless thriller with another repetitive predictable ending. Well it turned out I had to take my words back on this one. The craft by director James Mangold by utilizing various plot twists succeeds in demonstrating the ins and outs of how a thriller movie should be done. There is a cornucopia of frightening scenes that might inspire you to sleep with the lights turned on if you're watching this movie alone at night. It's also not at all ashamed of playing games with your mind and represents itself in a very confident matter. Some of the well known thespians featured in 'Idenity' include the always versatile John Cusack, Ray Liotta with his perpetual menacing demeanour, Amanda Peet with her combined beauty and charm and Rebecca DeMornay with her solid delivery of lines. They all shined splendidly in their respected roles. But it was Cusack who surprised me for being a capable actor in a thriller movie.The DVD has a few little extra tidbits added in for further information about the movie and some extended scenes that were left out in the theatres. However, the extensions are really not worth mentioning. Even the alternated ending was really all not worthy to take note of either. But it's the theatrical version that one should see, but if you're curious about the extended versions well I'll be the last person to stop anyone from seeing it. And as usual there's the deleted scenes, the wonderful commentary, and of course the little featurette to go behind the scenes of the movie.'Identity' is a break from the monotony from the god-awful excuses that have the audacity to label themselves as thrillers. The film offers 90 minutes of chilling scenes that will surely make your eyes pop out and you tongue hang out. The script was brilliantly edited and the cast was very impressive. Those who were doubtful of the how this movie will transpire (guilty!) it will have you think twice before you count your chickens. The mind games continually progress throughout the movie as you'll be mesmerized by everything that was showcased on the screen. This is truly the thriller among thrillers and will manipulate you to watch this again and again.",9,0,0,5 March 2012
Munich," Engaging Throughout, But Far From a Masterpiece
","Set at the 1972 Olympics emanating from Munich, Germany, Palestinian terrorists close in on the Olympic village targeting at the Israeli athletes making them hostages, while a massive shoot-out at the airport leaves several terrorists dead and all the athletes who only wanted to compete against others thriving to capture some medals, only to be left out with lives lost and hearts broken. Stunned by such tragic events, Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir (Lynn Cohen) sends Mossad agent Avner Kaufman (Eric Bana loosely based off of real character Yuval Aviv), under the supervision of Case Officer Ephraim (Geoffrey Rush) to take down the 11 Palestinians who were involved in the chaos. Avner is accompanied by South African driver named Steve (Daniel Craig), a Belgian toy-maker turned bomb expert named Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), an Israeli soldier and cleaner named Carl (Ciaran Hinds) and a Danish forger named Hans (Hanns Zischler). Together, they are met with a secretive French informant named Louis (Mathieu Amalric). Avner puts his mission in question as he abandons his pregnant wife wondering if he'll survive or perish.No question about it, 'Munich' will have you pondering, but the focus at times falls off kilter with a ridiculous continuity error with poor soul falling dead on his chest by being annihilated by a large bag of shopping in the lift lobby of his apartment domain. It was such a wonderful scene, it needed to be shown again. And then I ask myself, why? It was kind of distracting me for a while until some scenes later when publicly orchestrated discussions from various alliances are situated in cafes, bookstores, the streets you name it, they're omnipresent. What's odd is that although they're supposed to be secretive, they're out in the public spectrum where passersby can see and hear what they're talking about.This is what I mean by off kilter direction and editing. It really questions the focus of the people behind the camera. Although we're heard ahead of time that that the film was based on actual events, but it's complex to determine which events are real and which stuff are for dramatization. Unless you lived the moment, we don't know the whole story. And I should not be sitting here chomping away at continuity errors or awkward shots, I should put emphasis on the more logical measures the Israeli's should have done to the Palestinians besides the eye-for-an-eye revenge. The logical measures could have had the Israeli's capture the terrorists and exploit them on live television in front of millions of people for the scumbags they really are.The whole concept of espionage is met with welcomed interest, especially the scenes by members of the clan led by the well cultivated Louis (played by the talented Amalric), the only person who hold the key to the whereabouts of the Palestinians behind the carnage. Michael Lonsdale was superb in his performance as Louis' Papa further elucidates the divergences that penetrate in this environment where their lives are always by the numbers.The main star of this film is Mossad agent Anver (Eric Bana) and I have a bit of curiosity when it comes to casting. As good as they are why did Steven Spielberg cast Australian performers like Eric Bana as Avner and Geoffrey Rush as his Case officer Ephraim? With the cultural intensity as heavy as this it's mandatory for specific cultural casting. My assumption lead me to believe that Aussies are easy to cast and speak fluent English and can adapt to any accent thrown at them. For better casting I would have cast Israeli actor Lior Ashkenazi to play a Mossad agent just like he did in Eytan Fox's brilliant film 'Walk on Water'.It's enigmatic to pinpoint which parts of this movie are factual and which parts are fantasy. The editing is highly questionable. I don't think vengeful killings will resolve any peace within Palestine and Israel. And even though this movie will keep you intrigued it still went on for too long. A lot of that lengthy time's energy sparks a ton of awkward moments.If you want to see a great film based on this interesting event. I would suggest the wonderful Kevin McDonald Oscar winning documentary from 2000, 'One Day in September'. The stories there are accurate and the interview with the lone surviving Palestinian was provocative.",7,1,4,2 April 2017
The Matrix," The Movie That Made Stars Out of the Wachowski's
","When it comes to the making of 'The Matrix', this truly made the Wachowski's a household name. The only other film I could recall the Wachowski's direct before was the 1996 lesbian based film noir 'Bound'. So though they've been around the block before, 'The Matrix' solidified their place in the Hollywood industry with fans always anticipating what their next film is going to be.It comes to no surprise that these siblings have been to movies goers since they were youths and studied the craft very seriously, even if it means recycling ideas from their predecessors but to good effect. The Wachowskis took bits of elements from various film genres to create an incredible masterpiece they can truly call their own here. Along with some butt-kicking from Carrie-Ann Moss and a new direction in his acting career as an action star from Keanu Reeves, we get an exciting action film that's second to none. There's no Shakespeare or Oscars in terms of acting (on the technical level the movie won 4 Oscars).'The Matrix' is just an endless array of energetic, exciting science-fiction action adventure that's both over-the-top in its delivery an engaging story that's both surreal and riveting and has a climax that will keep you invested. The film depends heavily not on the acting or the story but very rich in terms of special effects that set the tone for action film that rely heavily in special effects to get their audiences motivated regardless if the film makes any sense or logic.Set in the year 2099, (though through the Matrix universe, the film looks almost the present) due to a virtual-reality brought on by evil overlords who want to gather human beings and enslave them for their own advantage in a quest for domination. It's much more complex than how I explained it. It's another epic battle between humankind and machinery. We all know who's the heroes and the villains right?So after our hero Thomas 'Neo' Anderson (Reeves) swallows a red-pill by a charming rebel named Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) has successfully unleashed a barrage of warriors who take to the skies by hovercraft as they venture to the real world and virtual reality world as they are up against an Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) and his slick-dressed goons who are just computer enhanced holograms. Morpheus is depending on Neo to take down these villains and unplug the world back to reality.The chemistry between Reeves and Fishburne is wonderful in teacher/student format with fists of fury Trinity (Moss) thrown in for good measure. with Smith's ability to shape-shift, we can see bits of traces from Robert Patrick's performance of the T-1000 villain from 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day' when he morphs into metal-liquid.As I've mentioned before, the technical team were the masterminds behind this film. Production designer Owen Paterson and comic artist Geof Darrow contributed in making this movie as stylistic as possible with the characters sporting their dark leather apparel and their sunglasses at night. The fight scenes were nearly flawless thanks to fight coordinator Yuen Wo Ping where the performers use tricks with the help of wiring which makes these characters fly like human marionettes.But it's the direction from the Wachowski siblings who created an atmosphere that closes the end of the 21st century on a dark and cynical note. With the Y2K fear that was buzzing around at the time, this film created and unbiased point of view of the computer industry and the social media platforms it has created. Like everything else the age of the Internet can be both a companion and a monster at the same time.",9,0,0,9 October 2018
50_50," A Cancer Story That Refrains From Being Too Sentimental
","By balancing the the comical elements and the dramatic ones to a rather depressing subject like cancer, the trials and tribulations of living with it and the struggles to survive, '50/50' took a lot of craft and skill and a big hats off for director Jonathan Levine and writer Will Reiser for taking the risk to make this kind of movie possible. Other than 'The Bucket List', there have been few movies like this one where cancer and the endless fight for survival is executed in a comical fashion, because in reality a topic like this is usually never taken lightly and most directors might have the fear of striking the wrong cord towards a sensitive audience member. Therefore, a subject like this is mainly for those who are enthused with emotional drama or Lifetime Network movies. I found it curiously refreshing that '50/50' succeeds in making you laugh while you're hoping our protagonist succeeds in his fight against this deadly disease. The comedy factor comes through the fact that it was based on true story with very real characters and yet never gets too the point where it becomes overtly sentimental, which makes the pitch of the story nearly perfect. With a subliminal script by Reiser and a terrific lead by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, this is hands down one of the best movies of 2011.Gordon-Levitt stars as a 27 year-old young man whose life is put on hold after he was diagnosed with a deadly spinal cancer. Aghast from the news, he still tries to cope with everyday life and making the most out of it. But people around him and people who care about him starts to play even more pivotal parts in his quest to keep on living. Seth Rogen shines as his objectionable friend, Anjelica Huston is incredible as always as his often distanced mother who's in caring for her husband who has Alzheimer's Disease, Anna Kendrick looks very professional as his therapist, Bryce Dallas Howard is remarkable as his girlfriend and Philip Baker Hall and Matt Frewer are excellent as his chemotherapy partners who are in support with him all the way through. Everyone knows that life is precious and that we are all going to die one of these days. So we all must live our life to the fullest and never waste a moment of our lives. As Rogen forces Gordon-Levitt to supplement his illness for sensual pleasures is at times disturbing, but has its funny moments and succeeds in keeping it real.'50/50' sets the tone with the right balance of drama and comedy that's neither taken too lightly or too melancholy. Sure this provides plenty of laughs but there were a many scenes that will at the same time keep you riveted. The movie was inspired by Rogen's friend and writer Will Reiser as he himself was a cancer survivor and he put in the effort to refrain this movie from being a preachy and weepy story. I also feel that Joseph Gordon-Levitt has took a monumental leap in his career by starring in this movie. He's come a long way from his humble beginnings when he starred in the series 'Third Rock from the Sun' and has amazed us with his versatility and chameleon intentions towards the characters he's played throughout his career. Recently he has played a variety of roles recently like '500 Days of Summer' and was exhilarating in 'Inception'. I won't be surprised if he wins an Oscar or a Golden Globe in the near future.",9,1,2,14 May 2012
300," It's What You'd Expect in an Epic Movie and More
","From the call of the battle horns to the thousands of soldiers armed with weapons backed up by a heavy but effective soundtrack in the background to the scintillating special effects, '300' may look like another long-winded endless sagas of barbaric battles, endless bodies piling up and lots of red oozy blood for visual splendor. From observing the trailer those scenes that remained attached in your memory will manipulate you into driving out to see the movie or renting the DVD, but the best part is that the trailer is just glance of things to come. Unlike other movies that only feature the good scenes or edit out scenes and scary moments leaving you bored to death with too much talk and not enough action, '300' gives you more than what you've bargained for. The battle scenes are complimented with an equally compelling plot with some great acting by the cast. It goes beyond any mindless blood-laden movies from the past and present. Sure there's blood, but it exceeds many obstacles many Hollywood films fail to achieve.For those historical gurus who have complained that the movie sparked no significant accuracy,should just keep their noses in the books instead of dissecting every little inaccuracy there is. And besides how much accuracy is there in history books? After all we're not immortal so facts may have changed overtime. Not to put anyone down, but if you want accuracy, I watched a documentary on the Discovery Civilization channel that reveals actual scriptures that indicate Gods, Oracles and millions of people crossing the seas to take part in the battles. To me this movie goes way beyond a costume drama, even some of their sayings in Spartan times were dictated the way the could have spoken at that time.The visual effects is pure eye-candy and the background music is quite creepy and compliments itself through every scene featured. What more can you want? If this movie doesn't satisfy the average viewer than what does? This one movie you should enjoy and leave your historical analysis in the classrooms.",9,2,2,19 May 2009
Fast Five," Sequels Are Getting Better Through Time
","Like a fine wine, 'The Fast and the Furious' franchise just gets better and in 'Fast Five' my theory reigns true. The first part of the installment was high-flying and vastly exciting. Then the sequel came out which was not up to hype as its predecessor was, and then I was starting to give up hope once 'Tokyo Drift' was released, yes it was that bad. I really had lowered expectations when 'Fast and the Furious' was released and to my surprise it rejuvenated my confidence in the franchise, but 'Fast Five' exceeds all my expectations as one of the best movies of the bunch which is rare in the realm of tiring sequels and lazy remakes that the movie industry surreptitiously likes to promote. I mean 'Lethal Weapon' has had very good sequels in its heyday and 'The Terminator' not to mention 'Rocky' as well. I never expected this franchise would survive the test of time; it's like an underdog in its own right.The story on 'Fast Five' is well above average. It's like a continuation from where we left off from the previous installment. The story involves Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and the gang conjures up a way to escape the seemingly endless array of escaping from the law and family issues. There's another subplot that centers on a drug kingpin and a missing computer chip. If you have a DVR you could fast forward those scenes because they're really not worth mentioning. Which is all good, but the main purpose to see this movie isn't due to the brilliant performances or a scintillating script. The hell with that! You're here for the exhibition of colorful, high-energized cars, the endless nonstop action and the attractive ladies. That's why you come to see this kind of movie.As I mentioned before 'Fast Five' won't win any Oscars or Golden Globes, but you know what? Who really give a damn? The performers like Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Dwayne Johnson, Jordana Brewster and Sang Kang are all out to have a great time. And the chemistry within the characters is quite mesmerizing.Of course it's all about the action in movies like these, which will leave you breathless. Such memorable scenes include the one where gangs confiscate cars from a moving train. Who in their right minds would do something so stupid and dangerous? Another is an awesome foot chase in the condemned slums of Brazil (the scenery is postcard perfect). It's where The Rock and The Vin embark in a battle that was one of the rare moments that was not dependent on CGI. Let's not forget about the climax but I won't give any spoilers away. Also be sure to stay around for the end credits to know what the next installment will be about.Overall 'Fast Five' offers exhilarating action, backed up with scintillating visuals, with a compelling story to keep you on edge and great acting for those who love action flicks.",8,9,10,23 April 2012
Gangs of New York," Interesting Piece of New York History
","'Gangs of New York' is an interesting take on the Draft Riots that spanned between 1846-1863. It's high on entertainment, compelling, gratuitously violent but never disappoints you during the two hours and forty five duration. The Draft Riots was an endless feud that occurred at the time when corrupt political activists of the Tammany Hall took over the crime laden city, and the epic battles by Irish gangs in the Manhattan area that sets off the infamous draft riots. A young man known Amsterdam (Leonardo DiCaprio) befriends a sneaky pickpocket (Cameron Diaz) to get even the crazed Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis) who assassinated his father. The story was enthralling and the pacing was very subtle.Daniel Day-Lewis really lit the screen as the leading antagonist and was just natural in his performance as Bill the Butcher. And even though I'm not one of DiCaprio's biggest fans, but I have to pay the devil his dues, it is definitely one of his finest outings from him where at the times he was trying out for more older, mature roles. Though not ready for an Oscar, DiCaprio was really convincing as Amsterdam. Cameron Diaz was also wonderful in her smaller role. Director Martin Scorsese takes another angle of the New York's underworld, but adding another direction to it. This time we are sent back to the 19th century where street gangs came in fruition. His message is delivered to us flawlessly. I think he's among one of the best directors then and now. If you're in the mood for visual art, then look no further, because 'Gangs of New York' offers scintillating cinematography, the art direction is a treat to the eyes, and the costumes were accurate and authentic that truly fits the period well. Along with some skillful carpentry, Scorsese has recreated 19th Century New York like it was its own city itself. The setting juxtaposes itself between factual and fictional depiction of events as well as the use of clapboard building and very tall hats, which has intentions for some over-the-top reminder of what's taking place in this dreadful period in New York history. It's stunning to think that this movie garnered 10 Oscar nominations but ended up getting zilch. It truly is a very underrated movie. And even through all the chastising from the critics, I think this movie is one of the best movies of 2002.",8,0,0,8 March 2011
Spectre," An Improvement From the More Recent Bond Films
","As the 24th addition to the James Bond franchise, 'SPECTRE' is the highest budget in Bond history, but Daniel Craig is back in his forth role as James Bond and he's back for another high energetic, quick-paced spy thriller filled with gadgets, gizmos, hot women and dry martinis, shaken and not stirred. Aside from Ralph Fiennes returning as M and Ben Whishaw as Q and Naomie Harris as Moneypenny, Bond is also in fine company in the like of Christoph Waltz, Lea Seydoux, Monica Belluci and Dave Bautista, but the best of the bunch is Andrew Scott from the 'Sherlock' series. But one has to wonder does 'SPECTRE' have what it takes to be one of the best Bond films of the modern era?'SPECTRE' starts of with an oblique message from the past that sends 007 on an initiative to Mexico City where he meets a beautiful middle-aged woman named Lucia (Monica Belluci) who also happens to the widowed wife of a notorious felon. Bond conducts an esoteric meeting and unravels a diabolical organization known only by the abbreviation of SPECTRE. We next go back to London, the head of Centre of National Security Max Denbigh (Andrew Scott) evaluates Bond's actions and looks into the relevancy from the MI6 led by M (Ralph Fiennes). Bond seeks help from Q (Ben Whislaw) and Moneypenny (Naomie Harris) to find the whereabouts of Madeline Swann (Lea Seydoux), who is the daughter of an old rivalry Mr. White (Jesper Christensen) who may know how to decode and bring down the organization of SPECTRE. As the assassin's daughter, only she can understand what Bond is going through. As he clues in closer to what's behind SPECTRE, he gets a startling discovery that connects between himself and the enemy he's after.From the beginning, 'SPECTRE' is on the similar path from the earlier Jammes Bond that Craig was in as we explore the more personal relationships that we've been following over the years. Unlike the other Bond films, Craig's version has embodied more emotional attachments. For those loyal fans who have followed Bond and liked him for the more carefree character, it's quite refreshing we see Bond narrowly escaping potential death, a more brooding intense character like the Bond we see today is gladly a welcome addition even though unconventional. And while Christoph Waltz may not be as fearsome as Bond's arch enemy Blofeld may not embody the the more fearsome presence of Javier Bardem's Silva character from 'Skyfall', but his domineering and yet stunning charisma can be just as equally intimidating. But the audience would've loved to see more physical battles between the two. As for Bond girls as of late Lea Seydoux's Madeline Swann is 10x better than Olga Kurylenko from 'Quantum of Solace' and Berenice Marlohe from 'Skyfall'. However, Eva Green from 'Casino Royale' is the best Bond girl from the Daniel Craig Bond era. Andrew Scott who's been quite impressive in the 'Sherlock' series is still as diabolical as ever in his role as C who wants to go to great lengths to disclose the 00 program. And even though the action scenes are quite scarce, they are the meal ticket to this great thriller. Former WWE superstar Dave Bautista makes his appearance as the towering big guy Mr. Hinx. Bautista's entry in the film may start as just an eye-opening teaser, but the confrontation he has with Bond on the train to Morocco was one of the greatest fisticuffs ever in a Bond movie. And even though Sam Mendes succeeds in weaving the four outings of Daniel Craig's Bond character over the years, the finished product does take in a more slower pace that's in contrast to the other Bond films. Overall, 'SPECTRE' still succeeds in providing its audience an endless array of exciting action, plenty of cool gadgets, spontaneous car chases, and gorgeous ladies. It would've been better if they found a better theme song than Sam Smith's 'Writings on the Wall'. But other than a few minor quips, 'SPECTRE' is an awesome action espionage film.",7,2,7,28 August 2016
Coach Carter," One That Has A Light Message Of Hope
","'Coach Carter' is a heart-warming story that is based on actual events, but what stands out from the other true story movies is that it refrains itself from any kind of 'artistic licencing' from being a Hollywood movie. And that is simply because it really doesn't need to. The inspirational story of Coach Ken Carter and the Richmond Oilers is molded as an uplifting to one's spirits and it tells us that there really is a ray of hope and that we can achievement if we all believe in ourselves.Sure it sounds lame and preachy, but the movie is constantly fixated on telling us that academics must come before athletics. The main focus is centred around Coach Carter and the gripping sports scenes is enough to satisfy any sports fan especially those who love basketball.Samuel L. Jackson is flawless as the no-nonsense Coach Carter and he does without putting much effort into the role but the dedication to his coaching and his encouragement towards his team is just the natural way to prove how developed this character really is. The performance and the accuracy is so impressive you wouldn't think it was Samuel L. Jackson performing, but the real Coach Carter himself. But he's not the only thespian who melted our heart, but the performers who played the students; in fact they are the heart and soul to the movie as they keep this movie as real and effective as possible. Even singer Ashanti shows her acting chops are quite effective and not flashy at all.Unlike most movies who cowardly take the easy way out by just rushing through the ending and going for the formulaic happy ending, 'Coach Carter' ends the movie with a real ending where these athletes are not destined to just winning the school's championship but where their academic achievements became a top priority to them. I wish that Hollywood would have more stories on values like these than the garbage we've been fed to over the years.The extras on the DVD are quite special as we are introduced to the real Ken Carter who seems to come across as being more but amusingly laid back and less intense than Jackson's portrayal. But i'm sure the real Ken Carter must have left a lasting impact toward the students and the kids as Richmond High. I just wish the documentary on Ken Carter was more in depth a much more longer and I wished we can get more insight on the students and compare the similarities between the actual students and the characters that were portrayed in the movie.The second feature looks into the making behind the movie itself as we observe just how the choreographing and the skill the characters had to go through to make and maintain the realism of the movie. The actual sports scenes are such a joy to watch it sends shivers down my spine. It might be mundane in some people because not everyone has knowledge in all the technical terms that's in basketball so if you're watching the movie for the drama and inspiration, please bring along a manual called 'Basketball for Dummies'. One of the weaknesses the movie has is that in the extras we don't get the opportunity focus on the mastermind behind the movie, director Thomas Carter. I don't know if he's just a humble individual or if he played a dominating role in the production, but he's never mentioned or talked about in the extras. I also wonder if the director is related to the titular character of the movie.To summarize this movie is quite pleasing and very optimistic in it message. It was a very entertaining and never falls prey to continuously preach that academics is equally important if not better than athletics. I think those who come from working-class environments to get a better view to show that there is always a sign of hope. The statistics that Ken Carter reveals to his students that young African American men are more than likely will end up in jail than advanced education is quite staggering. And this should open the eyes to not just black Americans but to everyone that prison life is not the life you want to live in. It's also important that just because you are playing basketball in school, doesn't mean it's a one-way ticket to the NBA. But a good education is the key to life and after watching this movie, I'm sure it will open eyes to everyone who really cares about their education.",8,0,0,19 August 2013
Contact," A Spiritually Enhancing Film
","The year 1997 was the year that every movie was below sea level to the classic Hollywood blockbuster 'Titanic'. But one of the more captivating, spiritually enhanced film that came out in that time period was 'Contact'. Under the careful eyes of long-time director Robert Zemekis, 'Contact' tells the exhilarating story of a brilliant astronomer (Jodie Foster) as she goes on a trivializing quest in search of other living things that go beyond out earthly bubble as she spreads the word that we are not alone in this universe. Dr. Ellie Arroway (Foster) is our protagonist is quite obsessed with finding this difficult question and will stop at nothing to fulfil the question many of us have asked, but never got the concrete answers to. Through all the details in this story, there are a plethora of deeper inner issues in Ellie's quest to search for extraterrestrial beings. in the end of her never ending quest into finding the unknown, we can look at her as an iconic rebel caused by global spectacle.From a very early age, Ellie as fascinated with astronomy. We learn that her mother died when she was very young and her father (David Morse) died while he and a young Ellie were watching a meteor shower fall down upon them. This was her calling card as she had an epiphany that someday,she will contact these extraterrestrials in hope to finally convince humankind that there is more life than meets the eye. Being somewhat iconoclastic in nature, in one of the flashbacks, we discover that the young Ellie tries to reach her deceased father, not from seances or psychic telepathy, but through her transistor radio to see if she can contact him through there. Whereas religious people pray for their parents in heaven, Ellie depends on technological apparatuses to as a spiritual guide beyond the grave. Her sadness is conveyed in the same format as our prayers in church, but with technology as her escape from the cruelty of separation, we can conclude that her grief is correlative to those who pray religiously. By that we can learn a lot from Ellie's reaching out to her deceased father, by which putting our faith in God, we can refrain from our fixations of greed and vanity and to appreciate the things that God has done for us.After Eliie's SETI project is about to be terminated after not finding any proof of alien life, Ellie hurried turns to higher profit moguls to desperately continue her search to contact with her late father. After being turned down by several corporations, Ellie finds reassurance from Hadden Industries, but was turned down once she started talking about her dreams. Although her presentation has lots of accurate details, she gets rejected because her research seems way over the top as science fiction. In other words her vision just doesn't fit the criteria of Haddens. It's like they've heard the same speech, but told differently a hundred times before. They just can't find something in Eliie's speech that has any bite to them. She eventually gets the funding once she get across towards those who were able to listen and to understand her who don't have the same intentions like she does. It raises the attention to the higher corporate echelons including the chief executive officer (John Hurt). After Ellie travels through space get some evidence, she comes back home empty. When forced to ask some heavy-handed questions from the National Inquiry, she can only conclude that through factual technical information, similar to cultural belief, we can only conclude by saying that a claim in nothing more than a simple hypothesis. For the first time in her life she can open up and claim that her research was not experienced through science, but by the facets of faith. Her heartfelt speech in the end can be a statement for a Christian missionary. The language through her speech shows an incredible force from the experience that Ellie went through. And sure her scientific beliefs are contrary to her long-tiring search to find the truth beyond our Earth, there is something that keeps her from going out to spread the truths about our universe. However one thing's for sure, we are all God's children and we all have tales to tell of God's generous, loving and caring personae.",9,1,3,12 July 2015
Born on the Fourth of July," One To Touch your Soul Even Through the Flaws
","Placed in the rightful hand for direction, Oliver Stone had experienced it all. In the Vietnam War, Stone was awarded the Purple Heart and the Silver Star so therefore no one else was qualified to direct this film that pretty much sums up the nightmare he had endured and the reception he got afterward. 'Born on the Forth of July' is the true story centering on Ron Kovic (Tom Cruise) who was bitten by the military bug after President John F. Kennedy's speech which inspired him to join the Marines. After all the propaganda hype got to his head, he decided to arbitrarily volunteer after high school.During his second voyage he accidentally annihilates innocent Vietnamese peasants and people of his own brigade while trying to escape the potential fatality of enemy cease fire. Three months into this, Kovic gets shot in the spine and has left him paralyzed from the waist down. He makes his residency in veteran's hospitals and almost gets his leg amputated, but he returns home to his parents.Back home he gets the displeasure reuniting with an old school peer named Steve (Jerry Levine) who's made a great business for himself and had better common sense than to volunteer in the Vietnam War. Kovic is labeled as a hero at a July 4th parade, but has a meltdown unable to cope with the fact that he caused just as much heartbreak as he did triumphed during his journey. He tries to win back his love for his girlfriend Donna (Kyra Sedgwick) who has become an anti-war supporter.Kovic is granted a monthly pension from the government, but he uses his restitution in favour for the sauce as he laments into a chronic state of self-pity distancing himself from his parents who evict him from their home as he travels to Mexico where he's retreated to a haven of other wounded soldiers including an argumentative Charlie (Willem Dafoe). There he starts drinking and hitting it off with hookers.Fortunately, Kovic has a change of plans and comes back home. He comes to terms with the family of the soldier he killed including his widow (Lili Taylor) and becomes an antiwar advocate as interrupts the Republican Presidential convention led by President Richard Nixon which resulted in him being assaulted and rescued. In 1976 at the Democratic convention in New York City announcing the release of his autobiography.After the success of his other films like 'Risky Business' and 'Rain Man', I though this was going to be chance for Cruise to shine come Oscar time. Sadly he lost out to Daniel Day-Lewis who played another crippled iconic. He dis win the Golden Globes for his performance and did get an ovation when Stone won for Best Director.The movie itself was a box office success considering that an accomplishment being that was made under a small budget. The fan base at the time on imdb.com rated this film a passing grade of 7.2 out of 10 considering the viewership of under 60 K. The main gender age demographics were males around the ages of 18 or under gave the bulk of the appraisal at 7.9 out of 10 I'm guessing these youngsters can feel related to the leading character as he's going through high levels of personal issues and that the attraction can reflect on the youth more easier. For the men over 45 years old, they rated this film at its lowest score of 6.9 out of 10. This is largely due the fact that the star of the film was not closer in connecting with the younger star at the time or that their views were not lenient towards Kovic's antiwar beliefs or the lack of patriotism depicted in this movie.In spite of all the fan support it has received over the years, there are a few flaws that came with the movie, though it didn't deter any of my expectations. Just some minor nitpicks They covered way too much ground making too much out of scenes that weren't in sync with the story. Who cares about Kovic and his failed efforts to win the wrestling title or to crash his school prom in a dramatic rain run. The Vietnam village annihilation was covered in many films before.But Stone and Cruise will go out of their way to leave nothing out in their storytelling even if pisses the life out of you. The intense moments they bring will be there to get a reaction and they really deliver the goods. Especially when Kovic's yelling at his own mother while drunk.Overall this movie is highly recommended with great performances and well deserved of his accolades and awards by the mass. It has an appeal and a btter connection towards its younger audience as it understands Cruise's character better. The older audience members may not sit well with his character or the antiwar statement it's given here. Sure it goes on for too long with scenes that don't fit the story but it thankfully doesn't meander. If you are into war dramas , then this film is a good watch that might touch on you.",7,0,1,26 June 2018
The Social Network," Riveting Story With Only a Few Flaws
","'The Social Network' is an enticing film to view which highlights the debates surrounding founder Mark Zuckerberg, Eduardo Severin, the Winklevoss Twins and Divya Narenda over who will get the credit for being the inventor of the world's biggest social network in the world, Facebook.Written by the legendary screenwriter Aaron Sorkin who claims that it this is a nonfiction piece, but sadly I beg to oppose. The movie has Zuckerberg being portrayed as a condescending, self-centered unscrupulous jerk and on the verge of getting dumped by a woman, which never happened in real life. Sure this scene makes me wonder if it is entirely nonfiction, but I digress, the scene is perfect in its pitch and the dialogue is quite sublime even if I thought Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) was treated in an unfair way. The acting is virtually tantalizing and the direction by David Fincher was near perfection. There's a real reason why a lot of reviews written are more longer than normal. Mainly because the dialogue raises a lot of provocative questions that will likely leave anyone intrigued. It is an overview that how a social networking tool has become one of the most innovative of inventions since the invention of the telephone. It's also compelling to note that with the exception for Eduardo (Andrew Garfield) I thought that most of the characters are billed as unimpressive (even Zuckerberg).Another thing that irked me about 'The Social Network' is that I appalled at the way then Harvard President Larry Summers (Douglas Urbanski) was portrayed. Urbanski is a recurring guest on Rush Limbaugh's program so I was aghast that there was no portrayal to cast Summers to a more darker character. Some were irked about the Winklevoss twins were dismissed of their allegations that Facebook was their invention, I found it revolting that the twins demanded Summers (who's now President Obama's economic advisers) demanded that Zuckerberg should be disciplined based on these pretenses.Numerous articles have been written chastising this movie for it's low opinion towards women. Well even though the time are changing, there is still a lot of misogyny in top Ivy League Colleges like Harvard and though it shouldn't offend anyone, sadly the truth hurts. It's still debatable if this movie is 100% accurate, 'The Social Network' is very scintillating movie to enjoy. And sure it's not my all-time favorite movie, it is still highly recommended to watch.",8,0,0,11 September 2012
In the Land of Blood and Honey," Flawed But The Intentions Are Good
","In its duration, director/writer Angelina Jolie's 'In the Land of Blood and Honey' is open with visuals of grimness, macabre, and will likely leave you in state of utter discomfort. The focus of the film is set in the war between the Serbs and the Croats that ran rampant between 1992-1995 as we are treated to brutal murders, heart-breaking rapes and cringe-worthy malice that will make your stomach green with pain as the violence is plenty and never turns back. Alja (Zana Marjanović) is a Muslim Bosnian artisan was forced into sex slavery at a Serbian troop headquarters as she's soon becomes saved by a dashing young Serbian soldier named Danijel (Goran Kostic) whom she befriended prior to the chaos. I can respect Jolie's decision to refrain from making the chaos a spectacle, but the love story implemented into the story adds flames to the fume while the malice is happening.While lingering onto Danijel's arms for her protection, Ajla is in a bind between whether Danijel is her soulmate or just his property. Danijel has opposed to fight with the Serbs as they were incapacitating the the Bosnian Muslims, though he still has to maintain his loyalty under the rule of his general father. While Ajla is being condemned by the other soldiers, Danijel stands there idly looking on. The feeling of unease becomes vital to Ajla as she put in a subservient position while Danijel expresses emotional rage regarding the fears surrounding him even to the point of pinning her to the bed and tying her arms on the bed posts with a belt and is about to rape her which shows he can be quite as tyrannical as his fellow soldiers.Jolie succeeds is making the violence hardcore while keeping the torn apart lovers romantic tale in tact. There is no apologies to the raping and carnage depicted here while the Serb troops are looked as the lesser of two evils. Civilians are gathered to sign petitions regarding their belongings to the troops. The men are shot, the babies are dropped off the balconies and the ladies are sent to sex slavery. These grim settings are seen through the eyes of Ajla's sister Lejla (Vanessa Glodjo) who abandoned the city with her baby daughter.Sure her humanitarian contributions can never be denied, Jolie doesn't neglect that this love story is set in the middle of a war, while also showing her disdain for international organizations and the United Nations for neglecting the war as the Balkans fell to defeat. With a cast primarily of Bosnian extraction and the use of dialects, the movie scores high points in terms of authenticity. In spite of the chaos the cinematography is quite impressive making us think we have not seen the end of Jolie's directing career.The main flaw about this film is the conflict between Ajla and Danijel which feels like a war within itself. Danijel wants to remain honourable towards his father and doesn't want to be a failure to him. But he's still has signs of him that can be fully sympathized. Ajla is just his sex toy and yet she invites herself to be that way. The movie shows no apologies when its marred with oppression. The tyranny of the human race is right in your face it can be overwhelming. And the rough relationship between Ajla and Danijel does little to help soften the nastiness that's around them.The talented Jolie shows she has potential as a director and writer is all there and even though there's flaws aplenty, the intentions are good. The love story in the movie reflects equally to the horrors of the Bosnian War which at times will leave a bit at times uncomfortable. The war depicted here is unsettling and really enough to leave you sickened. The film is strong is storytelling, but very distracting",7,1,6,6 February 2017
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," The Most Action-Packed of the Series
","It's unanimous, 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade' is one of the best action-adventure films of the series and may even be one of the best of the 1980's. The action, the humor and the sets, props and costumed are well nuanced and the action will keep you on the edge of your seat. Another great feature is that the Indy girl Dr. Elsa Schneider (Alison Doody) is up to par with our thrill-seeking archaeologist as the quick pace will make you dizzy.A memorable scene in flashbacks shows a young Indiana Jones (River Phoenix RIP) that further examines his upbringing that leads to the relationship between Dr. Jones (Harrison Ford) and his father, Dr. Henry Jones Sr. (Sean Connery) and his disdain to be called 'Junior'.We go back to 1938, as the adult Dr. Jones is out to rescue his father who's been kidnapped. With the help of his father's diary, which arrived unexpectedly, Dr. Jones can track down the whereabouts of his missing father. The diary locates Dr. Jones to Italy where he's introduced to Dr. Schneider who becomes a vital character in this tale.We now see Dr. Jones battling the German Nazis as the evil dictator Adolf Hitler is after the Holy Grail, which has possession to the blood of Christ. Which leads Dr. Jones and Henry Sr. chasing after the Grail before Hitler's henchman retrieve it. One of the best fight scenes was when Jones was battling the Nazis on a tank.This stands out very well in terms with very limited CGI graphics and everything looks and feels more real and natural. Even back in 1989 the graphics were pretty good and might be slightly ahead of its time. I recommend you see this movie. You won't be disappointed.",9,4,7,5 May 2009
Goodfellas," The Best Gangster Film Ever Made
","And so from the opening narrative from Henry Hill's (Ray Liotta) thoughts, he has always had that dream to become a gangster. Claiming that it was far better than being President of the United States. This was the beginning of a long-line of intriguing narratives of Martin Scorsese's brilliant character-study of Mafia life in 1990's 'Goodfellas'. Based on actual events we follow Italian-Irish kid Henry Hill from his humble beginnings to when he became ignited into an Italian crime family as we see him work his way through heists and his in-and-out prison systems to his drug trafficking empire. While this is happening, Hill's life and relationships were becoming more complicated for him to handle, he has to decide on whether he wants face death from his Mafioso allies or take his seat on the witness protection program. Behind all these enthralling events, Scorsese manages to add a myriad of colorful characters which has a benchmark filled with violence, humour, dedication, loyalty and finally the ultimate of all prices, betrayal. The other notable performances comes from Robert De Niro as decorated criminal mind Jimmy 'The Gent' Conway and Joe Pesci as the diminutive and equally short-tempered assassin Tommy DeVito who seems to be branded by a cornucopia of psychological disorders. Devito combines both the catalyst to both the gratuitous violence in the movie as well as most of the dark humour as well. And nobody combines both dark humour and violence better than Scorsese. Who can forget the the memorable 'what's so funny about me' scene which has a preceding story that is filled with sharp humour that follows later with intense dialogue only to followed by some friendly humour which leads to unexpected violence. It's classic scenes like this that make this movie so unpredictable and yet very magical. With a cesspool of talented performers, you could easily get lost in the shuffle, and that's exactly what happened to Ray Liotta here. I'm not saying he was terrible in his leading performance here as gangster wannabe Henry Hill. It's just that of all the major characters starring here, his was the lesser convincing compared to his costars. His narration lacked the integrity of a cold-blooded gangster, but more like a literature student contemplating on finishing his Master's thesis on gangs in New York. The weight carriers in this film depends mostly on the performances of De Niro and Pesci as they embody the emotions and the intrigue which makes the film very believable and at the same time rich in very specific detail. They're respected roles are the reasons to watch this movie because they're more fun to watch than Henry Hill who at times felt more like an observer as opposed to being part of the action like what De Niro and Pesci do. But with the characters and the dynamics within them are very satisfying and sure Liotta was great in his role and his narration does embody a man who seems to be feared of what he got himself into and how to get out if there is a way out without being dead. Rounding out the supporting cast I thought the chemistry between Liotta and Lorraine Bracco as Henry's Jewish wife Karen Friedman Hill was really special. The trials and tribulations of this dysfunctional married couple added great depth to the story was an important part of the film. It shows that unlike other gangster films, there is family life provided there and it steps out of the inner circle of gangster films which makes it all reason you can't miss out on a film like this one. However, unlike Francis Ford Coppola who's 'Godfather' movies used a more glorified side to the mob life, Scorsese took his direction out in the mean streets of Brooklyn and makes the disjointed relationship between Henry and Karen all the more realistic. Scorsese once said that all good films are there to teach us the lessons of life. 'Goodfellas' gives us a hard lesson about respect, dedication, betrayal, assets and liabilities. When all's said and done, 'Goodfellas' stands strong in terms of performances, cinematography, direction and writing. This movie is probably the greatest gangster films in the history of cinema. Even though it has some flaws, the movie does a great job in not only looking at the dark side of gangster life, but it demonstrates how good storytelling operates. A fine example of Scorsese's direction can easily be summed up near the end as Henry and Karen enter into the Copacabana as the go through the halls. They go past the club and past the kitchen and into a dining area where they are being seated at a table with waiters to serve them. I can't recommend this film enough, it's a wonderful movie, not just for gangster fans, but for people who appreciate good cinema.",9,0,2,31 January 2016
The Great Gatsby," Overrated Adaptation Of Fitzgerald's Novel
","In spite of having a degree in journalism, and has high regards to literary masterpieces and have had the honour to read and admire the one of F. Scott Fitzgerald's 'The Great Gatsby'. I was also very fond of the the adaptations that came after like the 1974 Robert Redford and Mia Farrow version and also the 2000 adaptation starring Mira Sorvino and Toby Stephens. And I'm sure my teachers and instructors if they ever had the chance to see this later adaptation directed by Baz Luhrmann, they like me will likely have their eyes rolling. At least more so than me. But even though I know the story and the happenings, I went to see what Mr. Luhrmann has to offer. And one bit of advice for those who saw the movie, but never had the pleasure read the book, read it after not because of what justice Luhrmann did with the book, but more like what he neglected. Tobey Maguire stars as Nick Carraway a former writer who's now in the bond-selling business. He seems fond for his neighbour, a charismatic, dynamic millionaire, James Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio). Every evening he throws these elaborate parties at his abode, but is still quite melancholy. He still has feeling for Nick's cousin Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan). Daisy has moved on in a rather unloved marriage to a skirt-chasing scoundrel named Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton). Gatsby lives on the opposing side of the lake where Tom and Daisy live. Her persuades Nick to set up a reunion in hopes to reignite the flame to the torch that was put out years ago. Like all of his movies before this one (that includes 'Moulin Rouge'), Luhrmann takes has execution in an over-the-top perspective which will be liked by some chastised by others. Once again this movie like 'Moulin Rouge' falls victim for the usage of playing inappropriate music that doesn't fit the time period. Which to me is ludicrous. I found it absurd to see Mr. Gatsby driving his car to the sounds of Jay-Z with contributions to modern artists like will.i.am, Beyonce and Lana del Ray, when yet he should be driving to the beat of big band artists like Charlie 'Bird' Parker,Louis Armstrong and Cab Calloway. Sure these modern artists may make this film a bit more fun, but it's still inappropriate. And to add more to this strange brew, Luhrmann decided to make this film in 3D. It might work well in the party scenes along with the streamers, confetti and fireworks to give it more in-your-face look. But by the second half of the the film, the 3D just loses its necessity. But it's still fun to look at. So even though the visual effects are a thing of beauty, the storytelling was what brought this film down quite tremendously. Sure his flamboyance in making the film look exquisite, but the actual story itself leaves you with an empty feeling in the end. The plot was quite impressive with Gatsby and Daisy trying to get back together, but at times the execution feels quite tiresome and not very fulfilling. DiCaprio and Mulligan turn in great performances, but the passion and devotion to one another isn't very convincing. They seem to not have much chemistry between the two and that ruins the atmosphere substantially especially since they're trying to get back together after their love was taken from them. Tobey Maguire looks very one-dimensional as Carraway. But let's not implant the blame game on Maguire, but it's the script by Luhrmann and Craig Pearce which has him narrating and observing the world around him, without really having any idea how he feels about what he's up against. The final minutes of the film get quite dramatically intense and the gist of the story is where the story really starts to unfold. By then it was too little too late. Sure the film is visually stunning, the music was fun, though not fitting the time period, the performances were impressive and the story was splendid. But in spite of all that, the film did not offer enough bit than it should have. With all the scandals,mysticism and romance it has to offer, it still left me feeling cheated. The film is entertaining as it is, but overall it is still overrated. The book is way better if not see the older adaptations for better details.",6,2,2,25 May 2015
Alien: Covenant," Better Than Prometheus But Forgettable Characters
","In the year of 2109, the crew of the USCSS Covenant embark on quest to start a new colony on the planet of Origae-6 by virtue due to the rogue transmission where several colonists are in pods and human embryos are secured in frozen storage. Terraforming Chief Officer Daniels (Katherine Waterston) has a growing fear of reluctance when the crew appoints an android named David (Michael Fassbender who later plays a similar android named Walter) who had survived the unsuccessful Prometheus mission.As soon as the title for 'Alien: Covenant' materializes on the screen, I was excited to see Ridley Scott was going to direct his third film in the 'Alien' franchise and I was equally mesmerized by the haunting score by composer Jerry Goldsmith. After several mixed reviews from the previous installment 'Prometheus', it was time for Scott to return back to the basics and with the theory that in outer space, no one will hear you when you scream. Though at times 'Alien: Covenant' can be a bit too talkative like 'Prometheus', but it has scenes reminiscent to the original 'Alien' movie with great details of graphic imagery, plenty of horrific gore and more excitement.The movie opens up with a clear view of David's eye which is an homage of the Voight-Kampff test from the original 1982 'Blade Runner' movie by director Scott. Situated in a secluded immaculate white room, Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce) manipulates his creation David about the mysteries surrounding creation, while he gets him to play a piece by Richard Wagner, 'Entry Of The Gods Into Valhalla'. Clearly the template that led to the events of 'Prometheus', we get cut to tens years later when Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) places David's head in a duffel bag and sends him off to space. We're now in 2109 and the crew of the Covenant is sending 2000 podded colonists to the hospitable planet Origae-6. The symbolic sounds to John Denver's 'Country Road' indicates that this newly established planet will ensure better living conditions here on Earth. After suffering casualties that left the crew traumatic, the crew take refuge on this planet. There's breathable air, plenty of wheat, but sadly we hear no bird or animal sounds. Gasp!'Alien: Covenant' does manage to succeed in upstaging 'Prometheus' by utilizing the many many tropes that's been a trademark in the franchise. We have crew spewing off their hilarious banter, the ship's computer MOTHER makes a return, there's a conflict over quarantine, there's scenes involving dripping water, eggs along with Facehugger, Xenomorphs and Chestbursters. There are some twists added to the familiar formula that comes into place. We are introduced to a baby alien that resembles that of a Baby Groot. The Neomorphs seem more agile than the other Aliens in the franchise who have the capability to leap and move like a Velociraptor when they're confronting the crew.The atmosphere in 'Alien: Covenant' is high in intensity. When first encountering the domeheads, high levels of discomfort comes into effect with vicious shaking moments and several scenes of unsettling darkness to the creatures developing the skills of head-butting. It's not at the the same levels as Scott's previous films like 'Alien' from 1979 to 'Aliens' from 1986. There is some innovative death scenes but they remain less climactic as the original installments. Also the momentum is quite muddled up at time as well.When it comes to the crew there are just too many and most of them are underdeveloped and not very noteworthy. For Waterston's character Daniels, she spends most of the time lamenting in grief. Taking over as the new captain on the ship, Oram (Billy Crudup) has more concern of his religious beliefs and if it puts his authority to question. The only true standout character is Danny McBride's character of Tennessee but it's because he wears a cowboy hat. The most interesting character has to be Michael Fassbender's portrayal of the character David and enhanced newbie named Walter. David is the only character on the newly discovered planet. There's some bizarre scenes where David instructs Walter on playing the flute, upstage one another in Romantic poetry which is weird in detail.The balance within 'Alien:Covenant' is that there are similar comparison to other Ridley Scott films like 'Prometheus' and 'Blade Runner' with Scott almost figuratively playing God in the series of discussions on board. The early 'Alien' movies had a mix blend of 1980's slasher flicks with the science fiction elements to come with it. Unfortunately this installment has too much dialogue making it feel like it's trying too had to be intellectual and philosophical when it really shouldn't. The visuals from the previous outings are few and far between. With the success of 'The Martian', Scott still has the knack for sci-fi adventures and can undercover huge details like sprouting sails and how aliens rely on atoms through the smoke rings. Though mostly serious there is some humourous quips from the script by John Logan and Dante Harper including one gag based on 'Phantom of the Opera'.In the end it's a step up to the mixed feelings of 'Prometheus' in which 'Alien: Covenant' is strong in the the thrills department, but is sadly deprived of any star power or any memorable standout performance.",6,1,1,22 April 2019
All the President's Men," Excellent Coverage of the Watergate Scandal
","Based on the bestselling novel from veteran journalists Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, 'All the President's Men' was directed with absolute care by director Alan Pakula and a very intelligent script by William Goldman, this movie set standards that are almost to near impossible. Not only was this multidimensional Oscar winning film exposes the happenings of the Watergate Scandal, it also focuses on the goings on behind the scenes of newspaper writing. What made this movie stand out above the rest was that it refrained from falsifying any kind of Hollywood clichÃ©s or overly pandering on the two leading performers who were pretty hot at the times (Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford). This is a very conventional film that succeeds in keeping it real to the point that has the feel like a documentary which adds tension to every scene that's featured. There was never any doubt that stuff like this couldn't happen because everything happened felt like it did. We could relate to them when at times our two reporters are put in a precarious situation and just can't get out of it at times. Even during their failures, we can reflect upon them as they deserve our sympathy the whole way through. Back in the 1970's, Bob Woodward (Robert Redford) was still a relatively new criminal journalist for the Washington Post who was assigned to break into the Watergate Office Building. Veteran reporter Carl Bernstein (Dustin Hoffman) but his bravado has seen better days. Woodward was very vocal about his Republican beliefs, while Bernstein was very strong about his Democratic agenda which leads to the duo to question whether they should work together to disclose President Nixon and the Watergate Scandal. Through their political beliefs, they got along worse than two roosters in a coop. At first Redford and Hoffman were not the first choices to play the roles of these two ace reporters, but it was Warner Brothers recommended Redford to play the part of Woodward, due to him being a hot commodity at the time. While at a New York Knicks games, Redford spotted Hoffman and recommended he'd play the role of Carl Bernstein. Hoffman and Redford were backed up by a strong pool of supporting actors including Oscar winning performer Jason Robards as the managing editor of the Washington Post Ben Bradlee, Jack Warden as newspaper editor Harry M. Rosenfeld and Martin Balsam as the Post's managing editor Howard Simons. Hal Holbrook adds great mysticism as the shadowy figure who's the source for leaking information known only as 'Deep Throat'. This is quite a heavy initiative at the time since no one knew anything about this man at the time (it was later revealed to be FBI Agent Mark Felt). The technical features and the settings add merit to this very well executed film. Cinematographer Gordon Willis creates a stressful atmosphere towards our two disgruntled reporters as they draw nearer to unravelling secrets behind the Watergate Scandal. And while production designers George Jenkins and George Gaines recreated a believable newsroom while situating it on a Warner sound-stage.The film looks into the the revealing of E. Howard Hunt's phone number the robbers who tried to break into the Democratic National Commitee in possession of the slush funds that was under operation of the Committee to Reelect the President (CREEP) that funded political sabotage and from there Woodward and Bernstein try to puzzle that link that leads to one H.R. Haldeman. We follow our reporters as they gather one tidbit of information to the next trying to get something out of their stressful investigating. Many people who have pursued their careers in journalism must have seen this movie, but it makes you wonder, how many of those students understand the complexity of the story? Do they see the painful restless search for the truth can be a very tiring task and trying to finalize each fact, or do they only see this movie of two ace journalists who made it big by uncovering the biggest scandal in American history and became famous and successful after that? The Watergate Scandal was a primary example of a red-handed 'gotcha' style of journalism that still lingers on forty years later, but Woodward and Bernstein who were famous for uncovering the Watergate Scandal aren't the kind of journalists who do that kind of work. The whole Scandal just fell into the wrong hands at the wrong time.",9,1,1,1 February 2015
The Soloist," The Artistic Values of this Movie Goes Beyond What's Expected
","The beauty of 'The Soloist' is gloriously flabbergasting. The music will have you in stitches. The creativity in the making of this movie will inspire you to pick up an instrument and join in because the music is so sublime. But throughout, the message carries with you the whole way through and it's artistic values never shy away from the theme of the movie. The movie is not a family oriented movie, primarily due to the strong subject matter centred around a homeless man with a mental setback and the lack of service the state of California can do to provide this important cause. This at times can even be aggravating to even the mature audiences, but the story is capable to educate you on this subject and also to be entertained by the audiences. For those who have family members with mental illnesses can easily relate to the character of Nathaniel Ayers (Jamie Foxx in an amazing performance), in the difficult struggles they face in life and towards the family members who are handling the situations they face. And those who have never encountered a person in the condition Nathaniel faces everyday in life will be able to understand that even though he's ill, doesn't mean he's not able to amount to anything. Even though Foxx and Robert Downey Jr. turned in some excellent performances, they are backed up with a strong supporting cast which also provide equally amazing performances. The cellist who was tutoring Foxx's character comes off as unlikable, but the actor who played the character banked a convincing performance. The character was in serious desire for a reality check it's not funny. One of the most memorable scenes was when the musician tutor calls journalist Steve Lopez (Downey) to set up Nathan for a performance. While the phone call is in progress, he is in an awkward position that keeps himself isolated and incoherent in the world that surrounds him, making this guy an arrogant and ignorant character. But this character in particular may symbolize the ignorance of society in general and how lackadaisical we are for people like Nathan's character.Like one would expect, lot of ground has been covered that it can leave one very sad after the credits roll. Not from the high-profiled storyline, but more from our own self-centred agendas leaving out those who are in need for our help only to be neglected by us.",9,0,1,4 January 2010
Law Abiding Citizen," Great Movie, But The Ending Has Many Flaws
","Is it just me or has Gerard Butler been getting more attention lately? I respect the fact that he is versatile and change from playing a plethora of roles ranging from the rough and rugged Spartan in '300' and then next thing you know he'll embrace you with his charm and wit in the romantic comedy 'P.S. I Love You'. Now in 'Law Abiding Citizen', he's getting the adulation from the smart viewers all the while looking intimidating, carrying that rage that's brewing in him throughout the film. The opening scene in the movie commences with a break-in in which Clyde Shelton's (Butler) wife and daughter are killed. During the trial, attorney Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) negotiates that the killer will serve five years in jail and his accomplice will get the death penalty. This doesn't sit very well for the angered Clyde feeling that the accomplice was got the worst end of the sentence. Ten years later, we see a vengeful Clyde ready to take justice in his own hands. But Nick is dumbfounded as he tries to elaborate the motives behind Clyde's motives. What differs this movie from F. Gary Gray's previous project, 'The Negotiator' the action gets fueled up a notch. And while Foxx and Butler's pairing pales in comparison to Samuel L. Jackson and Kevin Spacey, the twists and turns in 'Law Abiding Citizen' will keep you enthralled. But the motives behind the proceedings take an upsetting backseat. Screenwriter Kurt Wimmer manages to pull off a handsome solution to the conclusion of the film, but it's unclear of what they were trying to get at. It boggles the mind as to whether Wimmer pondered with more than one conclusion and I have doubts as to whether the one he selected was a wise decision. The premise was well in intentions, but the ending left me with an empty unsatisfying feeling. Others may feel differently about it saying it was the perfect way to wrap up this movie. What irks me is that the justice in the end remains unclear.Overall it was an honor to watch. The tension brewing between Foxx and Butler was a treat for the eyes. The supporting cast backs up the two leads, but it's the duo of Foxx and Butler that carry the film. Though not as strong as 'The Negotiator' but the entertainment is well above average.",6,0,2,9 August 2010
V for Vendetta," A Good Way Of Questioning Our Own Freedom
","V For Vendetta' is a rare delight for various reasons. It has artistic qualities that succeed in being commercial worthy and is not ashamed about being manipulative. It scores high merits in terms of style and requires attention from the very opening scenes and never goes back on its intentions until the final closing credits. It never falls victim to be morally drawn in its message and for a better understanding, this a thinking person's type of movie. It never has to resort to the tiresome clichés or cheap ways to escape from a scene in a rushed kind of manner. The characters portrayed in the movie are very well-drawn and are never caricatured and never once do they preach about moral values that they are trying to bring across to it audience and in the end it works out quite effectively. The plot is very complicated (but it still very fun to watch nevertheless). The story is set in the year 2020 in England. In that time period England has been overruled by a regime that is fascist which had materialized by the paranoia caused by an influx of terrorist attacks. Freedom of expression and liberal ideologies are know obsolete and all information is in the hands of the government and if anyone has a problem with that will likely be gone and if you're a Muslim, well you can forget it. What stands out from all these other dystopia regimes is the stunning atmosphere. The England depicted here is like a hellish nightmare where it's hostility and fear is backed by fear and paranoia and the tension is quite isolating. The setting for this movie is filled with an engaging atmosphere, that's also quite exotic and even quite power-charged. The setting of this dystopia England has a unique ensemble of well-developed protagonists and antagonists, like the powerful, but ruthless High Chancelloe Adam Sutler (John Hurt) and the more if strangely sympathetic Chief Inspector Eric Finch (Stephen Rea) all the way to the film's leading heroes V (a brilliant Hugo Weaving) and Evey (Natalie Portman). All the characters were wonderfully drawn and the characterizations are the best that I have ever seen since 'Pulp Fiction'. And I'm glad they avoided any kind of character that would ruin the movie (right Jar-Jar Binks?) The story itself centers around V's mission to go up against the tyranny that has been bestowed upon his country and we just want to root for him all the way. V is a very cool and endearing character. We may not always like the things he does to stand up against the empowered government. Sure his tactics are violent and not for the weak of heart, but we got to give the man credit; he has a lot of guts. As I mentioned before, this is a thinking person's movie. It gives us a thing to contemplate on, the way our government runs and to question ourselves and ask ourselves are we as free as we are lead to believe? Okay so I don't agree that killing another person is not the right way to go about fighting for freedom, but we as a society should ask how limited is our freedom? And as our society caves in will our freedom be more limited as the years roll on? But make no bones about it 'V For Vendetta' is high in terms of entertainment too. The plot is exhilarating that is high on thrills, unpredictability and filled with some subliminal revelations. The executions in the action scenes were quite thrilling and the dialogue is clever, witty and at times humorous in a philosophical point of view. On a technical sense the visuals are purely magical. In a nutshell, this movie is a cult classic.",9,3,7,27 May 2013
Furious 7," Great Send-Off to Paul Walker (1973-2013)
","Since its fruition in 2001, the 'Furious' movies has been a high octane franchise that churns out exciting adrenaline-pumping action mixed with colourful characters and intense story-lines. The first of the series had a 'Point Break' thing going for it. The second one was a letdown due to Vin Diesel's absence, but it was still exhilarating. 'Tokyo Drift' was the worst of the bunch. The forth one was great the Vin Diesel and Paul Walker came back and came into the idea of adding fast cars action with espionage James Bond themed stories and since then it has never looked back. The series from 4-6 had shifted gears towards action films very reminiscent to popular movie franchises of the 1980's and 1990's and each film was played solely from the heart, which is a good thing, because never once does it feel forced, doesn't insult your intelligence and not played for cheap thrills. 'Furious 7' follows that trend like the 4-6 of the series only this time instead of jumping for joy in excitement, I was in tears of joy because the movie was well made, but tears of sadness as this was Paul Walker's last film before his tragic death.To be frank, I was a little hesitant of seeing 'Furious 7'. I was scared, that this film was just there to cash in another franchise just for the sake of it. I also thought that Paul Walker's death would be too much heavy-cargo for me to sit there and realize that I'm watching an underrated performer to never grace the big screen again. Another thing that made me hesitant was that Justin Lin was not coming back this time around to direct. And though James Wan was great in his directing debut in the franchise, we see that action is not the genre of his craft. Granted there was some great usage of slow-motion captures and Wan seems at ease with the 'Wan-cam', but still many times the editing of the action can be a bit rusty and sloppy and the close cuts and the zooms make the action hard to follow at times. It's still ten times better than 'Taken 3', but the scenery is opaque and indecipherable at times. There are some really cool moments like when Brian O'Connor's (Walker) speeding down the transport and was about to fall to his demise, but was successfully rescued in Letty Ortiz's (Michelle Rodriguez) car. Sadly, the action scenes are not in the same league as series 4-6. The showdown was a bit of a disappointment, the drone fiasco left very little impression because I was more excited about an epic showdown between Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham). It truly pales in comparison to 'Fast 6' where the entire swat has his and her time to shine. Although she was best thing to happen in 'The Expendables 3', I thought Rhonda Rousey was badly wasted here as a Head of Security to an Abu Dhabi billionaire.Even though the action was not up to par from the series 4-6, it was still very character driven. It was great to see Walker and Diesel go at one more time for one last ride. Dwayne Johnson was Luke Hobbs shows why he's valuable asset to the franchise. Michelle Rodriguez shows she one of the toughest action film stars out there and it's a pleasure watching her kick butt. Jason Statham is by far one of the best villains in the franchise in hopes he plays more villainy characters in the near future. And even though I may have been a bit down on the action, it's still fun to watch in all its over-the-top imagination. The pacing is executed briskly up to bring some action and character develop,meant. Very entertaining and a nice swan song for Paul Walker. The last five minutes of the movie were very emotional and it was handled in a very crisp, tender moment and the epilogue to O'Connor was fulfilling and very well executed. Even though there are more sequels to come, there's part of me that wished this film would end the franchise because the ending was so perfect. After the credits rolled I really left the theatre satisfied given I was entertained, engaged and filled with tears in both joy and sadness as O'Connor drives his fast-car into the heaven's above.",8,1,2,4 June 2017
The Godfather," The Geatest Movie Ever Made
","You can't really criticize a film like 'The Godfather', especially from a younger-type guy like me. Since its release in 1972, 'The Godfather' has been highly praised by fans universally. It's extremely hard for a person who has never seen 'The Godfather' without having high expectations because millions of people, maybe more have been talking about how wonderful it is. But as a film critic who has seen the movie several times and has read the novel that it was based on by Mario Puzo, this movie really deserves the credibility it gets. It really is that special. The film is a gripping epic that indulges the viewer with plenty of unsuspecting twists and a plot that works in a multitude of dimensions. The mobster's depicted here face many trials and tribulation that involve marriage, favours, family struggles, turncoats, tragic events, violence and rigor mortis.Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head patriarch and kingpin of his esteemed enterprise is acquainted to at his daughter's wedding, which is a special occurrence in Italian tradition (Sicilian in particular) where the father of the bride is to refrain from offering the groom any special favours. His representatives showing their signs of respect towards the Don are featured in the opening scenes are told through their ways of personal address and greeting regimentations. The Don is to be treated with respect and dignity, a man who follows his own frame of mind to what is fair, and will likely deny any means of avenge. As an example, if anyone was to fondle with his daughter in any kind of way grounds for murder. It's not revenge, as long as your daughter's still breathing.There are also numerous facets that indicate how not so respected the Don really is. Vito comes from the old school of Mafia, and can be labeled as a 'Moustache' Pete. For one, unlike his adversaries, he refuses to get involved with drugs or smuggling for that matter. It this is much to the chagrin of other rival mob units in the state of New York. The violence is described disturbingly as nothing personal, it's just business. The philosophy behind this organized crime is chilling, but quite convincing. The violence is creepily accepted and sometimes happens all of the sudden. Suddenly, the Corleone enterprise falls on its foundations, and it's up to the next generation to restore the family so it could be ranked as the top of the best mob families.The cast features a myriad of talented performers each playing their respective roles flawlessly. The top stars like Brando as Vito, James Caan as the hot-tempered Sonny, Al Pacino as the likable Michael, John Cazale as middle-sibling Fredo, Robert Duvall as mob attorney Tom Hagen, Richard Castellano as Clemenza, Abe Vigoda as Tessio and Diane Keaton as Kay Adams are what I may have expected what the characters from Puzo's book look like physically. Even the smaller roles deserve special credit. The performances were absolutely amazing. The characters in the film compliment the characters from the novel and it is mainly due to the physical structuring and the carefully planned interpretation.The novel this movie was based on by Mario Puzo deserves praise in itself. Even though this movie was a fictional, there are a lot of authentic features that make every scene and every chapter to be real. I guess people when they think of mob bosses they visualize a supreme Don, sitting in his chair with a long facial expression contemplating with endless level-headedness and leadership. 'The Godfather' is a marvel from both the film and the novel and it is hard to determine what medium is the better of the two.If there is one thing that the book is better would be character development. Al Pacino's Michael Corleone is a more prominent character in the novel than in the movie. Michael's transformation in the movie is at times a bit rushed, while in the book it's handled more gradual. The other character Luca Brasi played by Lenny Montana was a more vital character in the novel, which while he was an ally to the Corleone clan, is marked as a threatening adversary with a dark and dreary secret. In the movie comes across as a big oaf, and not as scary. It's also nice that some of the smaller characters from the novel have engaging back stories like Captain McCluskey (Sterling Hayden). But that's good for the novel's sake, while the film would result in overdone detailing.Overall, 'The Godfather' is one of the greatest films ever made. Thanks mainly to the crew for creating a well-structured setting that compliments nicely to the characters, the script and most importantly, the direction of Francis Ford Coppola. Hats off to the cinematography from Gordon Willis which is backed nicely by the elegant score from Nino Rota and Carlo Savina. This film truly defines the words 'required viewings.'",10,14,19,26 May 2014
