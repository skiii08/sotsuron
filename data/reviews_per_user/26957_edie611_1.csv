3:10 to Yuma," Re: 3:10 to Yuma
","This is Academy Award Winning material...spell binding...a story about our history and the kinds of challenges that forged Americas backbone..a story about how the lives of three people changed one another's outlook on life. A must see. Outstanding acting by all main actors and supporting roles. This movie gives you a good idea of how hard it was to live in the 1800's in this country; the lawlessness, the immense greed,despair and through all of that...trying to do the right thing. It touches on many of the injustices that existed(still exist) and how each individual tried to approach those problems with their own philosophical ideas of life..and how those three lives touched one another ... it was perfectly executed..and the films ending is perfect. I couldn't help but give this movie a 10. Thank you for this movie.",10,3,7,27 January 2008
