"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," A terrific movie that didn't get it's due
","This movie is such an underrated classic. It's initial release was overshadowed by 'TO Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar', because most of the general public couldn't wait to run out and see Swayze, Snipes and Leguizamo in a dress. But the real warmth comes from this little Australian Film. I worked in the 'Drag Queen' Industry (although not as a drag queen - I was the genetic female cocktail waitress) and the general consensus was that this was a much more accurate portrayal of the life of a Drag Queen. Humorous beyond measure, yet poignant enough to give a glimpse into some of the problems and obstacles (Bernadette and Tick's conversation at dinner, Felicia's drugged out beating, the bus) facing alternative lifestyles. All in all it was a very good movie, portrayed by three very good actors.",8,4,8,11 July 2005
