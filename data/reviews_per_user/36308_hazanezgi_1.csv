Catch Me If You Can," Clever and funny, what a lovely film
","I am so angry because I watched this film too late. This film has a good acting, good story, good musics and several good laughs. The laughs were unexpected and the musics were great. I have already added this musics to my spotify playlist. Finally, true stories are rarely as interesting or as funny as this one. What a crazy man!",9,0,0,3 April 2020
