Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," New Star Wars Film Lacks A Heart
","I loved the original Star Wars films. I am still a big fan of Star Wars. When I first watched  Star Wars Episode 1:The Phantom Menace, however, I was dismayed by what I saw. Jar Jar Binks (in my opinion) is disgusting, grotesque, and he destroyed the entire movie. Perhaps what disturbed me the most about the new Star Wars film was that it lacked originality and creativity.  Liam Neeson read his lines as if he were attending a funeral. I missed Harrison Ford, and I was constantly looking for a character in the new movie which I could identify with. The original Star Wars films had a heart; you were constantly rooting for the good guys (or for the bad guys). The new Star Wars film was full of empty platitudes.   If I had to give George Lucas one piece of advice for his new Star Wars film it would be: REMOVE JAR JAR BINKS FROM THE NEW STAR WARS MOVIE AND CREATE FRESH, NEW ORIGINAL SCENES WHICH WILL EXCITE THE AUDIENCE.  I also have some advice for John Williams, who composed the soundtrack for the film (P.S. John Williams is my IDOL and my HERO. GOD BLESS JOHN WILLIAMS. What would the world be like without him?)  Here is the advice for Mr. Williams: INCORPORATE MORE OF THE ORIGINAL MUSIC FROM THE ORIGINAL TRILOGY. The pod racer scene was perhaps the most exciting scene in the movie. The actor who played Anakin Skywalker seemed too young and it seemed to me as if he was reading his lines.  Please, Mr. Lucas, re-watch the original Star Wars Trilogy, and then review Star Wars Episode 1.  Perhaps you will see what was missing from the new film.  I will always be a fan of the original films, but I want to see another Star Wars film which I can add to my list of classics.",5,0,1,5 January 2001
