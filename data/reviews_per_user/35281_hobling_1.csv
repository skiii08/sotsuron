Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," JAR JAR BINKS - JAR JAR STINKS !!!
","The movie was OK if Jar Jar Stinks hadn't commented on every single line or event in it! Drop him and the movie would be much better - I've seen A New Hope 103 times, Empire Strikes Back 64 times and Return of the Jedi 44 times - but after seeing The Phantom Menace twice I find that I can't stand seeing or hearing Jar Jar Stinks anymore which will prevent me from enjoying this movie over and over - too sad, too bad - let's just hope that he doesn't ruin the next movie also.And finally, Darth Maul, was NOT evil enough - he LOOKED evil, but never actually did anything evil (except fighting the two Jedis).",6,0,1,27 August 1999
