The Ring," WHY WHY WHY
","ok, i got hold of this film after having seen the original and been absolutely terrified by it, i couldn't get through it the first time was much too scared. but this one i just wanted to kill myself it was so so bad on its own not just in comparison. they tried to make it different by changing some thing about the film but it all just falls flat on its face. there isn't anything in the film except a promising performance from the guy who played Noah. the kid was just whinny and irritating, the dialogue was kinda dire and Brian Cox is completely pointless and unnesesary in the film. the effects in the film are appauling and really not needed see the original for proof that CGI aint needed, or see the Two Towers for how to CGI somebody well. i suppose ishould comment on the plot at some point apart from just bitching about how bad it is. a journalist promises her sister that she will find out what killed her daughter, which leads her to uncover the tape that seven days after watching it you die, she watches the tape and so do some others and then it has some pointless rubbish and it ends badly and unlike the original. there is very little that remains the same about the remake, for a good example of remaking a classic and brilliant japanese movie and making it american you can do no wrong it watching the magnificent seven! but if you want a film that is just quite bad tehn fine go ahead. but please at least give some consideration to watching the original and you can't possibly argue that this is in anyway 1 billionth the film that is! a poor film and one of the worst americanised remakes i've ever seen",1,0,2,16 February 2003
