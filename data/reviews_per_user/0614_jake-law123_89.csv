The King's Speech," Kind of overrated.
","Don't get me wrong, I thought this movie was good. But that's the thing, it was just good. It wasn't anything amazing, mind-blowing, or spectacular, it was just...good. But I don't think it deserved best picture. There are many movies made this year that should have won. Black Swan and The Social Network. Those two movies are amazing. Any one of those should have one. I mean, this is a fine nomination I guess, but to win, really. We all know the only reason the academy picked this is because its an adult melo-drama.The story is behind the speech impediment of King George VI, (Colin Firth) and his developing friendship with his speech coach, (Geoffrey Rush) who teaches him not only to learn how to speak better, but to appreciate and respect himself more as a person.I did enjoy Colin Firth's performance quite a bit, though I have to say that Geoffrey Rush had the better performance and part for the role. I say both him and Colin Firth, should have won. I didn't think Christian Bale's performance in the Fighter was all that great.The film begins with the conflicts before WWII, along with the growing issue involving George's impediment, and the failed attempt by previous doctors to fix it. His wife, (Helena Boham Carter) then finds Lionel Logue, (Geoffrey Rush) whose techniques turn out to be very unusual, but soon develops himself into a great friendship with George. Both Carter and Rush are very supportive. And Colin Firth has himself a heck of a role to play, and, as always, plays it perfectly. The performances and characters are probably the best thing about the film.Though it does drag a little, it didn't drag enough for me to no be able to pay attention, like most draggy movies do. Its not like anything the director did could have made the movie more special, it is what it is. I like the movie, but best picture worth? No. Maybe nominated, but not win. The Social Network and Black Swan were both a lot more interesting than this. Even if the best picture Oscar had to go to this, at least give the directing Oscar to another. I mean, the directing job of The Social Network and Black Swan were both amazing! I'm not saying this director didn't work hard, but I saw commentaries on all three of these movies, showing the directing, and I gotta say that the Social Network itself easily deserved the best director Oscar, as well as best picture.Some may find this a beautiful masterpiece, because they're into this kind of thing, I, on the other hand, find it good. Its not that great, but its not that non-great either. Its just, in the middle. If it hadn't won best picture, I probably wouldn't be talking about it, but since it did. I find it overrated because of that. I like the movie, but I don't love it.",7,1,2,5 September 2011
The Mask," Very funny and enjoyable!
","Not gonna lie. When I first heard of this film, I thought it looked stupid and ridiculous. Although I usually like Jim Carrey roles, it just didn't seem very enjoyable to me. Then I saw it, and I take back everything negative about it. Not only is it hilarious and awesome, but its one of my favorite Jim Carrey roles ever!Jim Carrey stars as banker Stanley Ipkiss, who finds a mysterious mask, that when put on turns him into a cartoony, green faced maniac who causes all sorts of mischief. This gets him into some trouble with not only the police, but a gang of mobsters.Funny and entertaining from start to finish. Of course it is Jim Carrey, so that is expected. He has two roles in here: One where he's normal, and then when he has the mask on. Both roles are funny. Cameron Diaz's introducing role as the target of Jim Carrey's affections, who also get involved in a lot of his mischief.Basic comedy with all standard comedy ingredients. Very laugh out loud funny. Good not only for kids, but for some adults as well. Everybody in general should find this to be a very enjoyable family film that has something to it that makes it more special than other comedies, which gives it a thumbs up for me.",7,0,0,27 November 2011
The Big Lebowski," Classic Coen Brothers.
","After being beaten by thugs who mistake him with somebody of the same name, Jeff 'The Dude' Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) confronts millionaire Jeff Lebowski on the mistaken identity, a confrontation that will lead to several bizarre and unforeseeable twists for him and his two bowling buddies, (John Goodman, Steve Buschemi).I'll be the first to say I do not see what all the buzz is about with this film. For some reason hipsters like to blow this up to be an absolute masterpiece, which is endlessly praised, quoted, and cos played. I like it a lot, but to me it doesn't stand out nearly as well as some of Coen's others, even though I still enjoy it. To me, it's a clever, fun, stoner comedy with a great cast and characters, but that's where it stops for me honestly.The characters are very colorful, Jeff Bridges is perfectly cast as the Dude, an icon that is mercilessly cos played, and he is funny in the movie. John Goodman as former Vietnam lieutenant Walter Sobchak is a great backup for The Dude as he mostly plays the muscle for all the predicaments they get involved in. Steve Buschemi's character was good overall, even though he doesn't get much screen time. What's great is that even the small roles in the film who get one or two scenes, still make an big impact on the film in the few scenes they're in. I can't very well make a Big Lebowski review without mentioning Jesus, the bowler for an enemy team of the Dude's bowler team, excellently cast by John Turturro, one of my favorite Coen alumni. Others like Philip Seymour Hoffman and Julianne Moore are also quite entertaining for the few scenes they are in.When I first watched it, I thought the plot was very bloated, lots of scenes and subplots that really go nowhere. Even though it adds to some funny scenes, overall it doesn't amount to much, but oh well. Regardless of my small complaints with this movie, it's a very fun, well made film with some entertaining characters, with some slight editing issues. Solid nonetheless",7,1,2,20 January 2016
Inglourious Basterds," Quentin Tarantino does it again!
","Out of all of Quentin Tarantino's films, such as Pulp Fiction, or Kill Bill, this one tops them all. Why, well for starters, the concept is pretty clever. Instead of being an epic WWII drama, Quentin thought, what if it were a comedy, mixed with drama. Little did he know what would come out, this. Brad Pitt is a military war soldier in WWII who forms a team of thirteen men assigned for one thing, and one thing only. Killin Nazis. Not in the style of devoted war heroes, but instead hardcore rad dudes who are the hippest guys in the war. The editing takes each scene with different people by chapters, as he usually does, with different plot points which by the end get mixed together to form one huge plot point. Christoph Waltz costars as a Nazi leader who follows these points and fools them all together, but his cleverness gets the better of him by the end. Not over long, and definitely not short, but manages to keep you entertained. Different from other war films, but thats what makes it so great.",8,0,6,8 June 2010
Argo," The hot film of the year!
","Ben Affleck, after all these years, is catching up with the other directors in the Oscars. All his films are either not that good, or not Oscar worthy, but now he has made a film nominated for 7 Oscars, including best picture, which it may win in a week from now. But it is well deserved. This IS the film to watch if you're looking for something hot and fashionable. It's got a perfect 1970's feel to it, with an excellent score, and writing.The Oscars have finally recognized that Ben Affleck has talent, as he adapts a film to the 1979 mission to extract 6 American hostages from revolutionary Iran, as the CIA sends in special agent Tony Mendez, (Ben Affleck) to extract them with their confidential plan to fake a film to make the Iran visit more real, hence the name of the film 'Argo'.From beginning to end, the mission is the main focus. No filler in any scene, the characters are likable, and fun to watch, as well as watching as they plan out the mission. The writing is brilliantly adapted, and not simple minded 'here's our plan'. During the mission, I was on the edge of my seat in the theater from beginning to end. Every scene is tense because any minute any of them could be compromised, destroying them all. Performances are brilliant by all. Ben Affleck maintains a straight professional face for most of the film, though I think it still works. The reactions of everybody as the mission unfolds is just so tense. You feel how scared they are, and even though you know they make it out, the tension with the music and cinematography is still amazing.What do I mean when I say this movie is hot? This is the Dark Knight of 2012. That 1 film that exploits every magazine, TV ad, or billboard. It shows it too. You feel that 70's feeling with the 70's music, hairstyles, and so on. Ben Affleck did a great job and making you truly feel like you were in the situation with these characters, and like Ron Howard's masterpiece Apollo 13, this film, despite knowing what will happen, can still shock and surprise you, and any film that does that is definitely worth a watch. Though i'm hoping Lincoln will win best picture, this film, if it does, is still acceptable.",8,0,3,18 February 2013
The Babadook," The most thrilling and appreciative horror film I've seen in a long time.
","Even though this may not be the scariest horror film, I can honestly say it's the best, and the most appreciative one to boot, going for well thought out and promising scares rather than your typical BOO! jump scares like the typical horror film you see made today.Amelia is a widowed orderly who stresses day in and day out in taking care of her distraught and outcast son, getting rarely any sleep every night over the death of her husband.Right away the film jumps into the plot. We immediately learn of the tragedy in the family without any forced exposition, and we passively learn of the son's disillusioned state. At first you feel for the mother and what she goes through for the son, but the film quickly changes moods in the blink of an eye, but keeps a steady pace on the tone.It has a chilling atmosphere the whole time, making you feel like it's another David Fincher film.Essie Davis as Amelia is amazing, especially for a horror film. The film makes you feel different feelings for her throughout, though her performance makes her likable and unlikable in all the right parts. The son impressed me to no end. He's the right amount of creepiness, but in the end he also has the most amount of humanity to him.What I really love is how self aware the characters are. When they suspect something they play it safe and smart. No clichés whatsoever. No going into an abandoned cabin in the middle of nowhere or investigating a strange noise outside BS, this film is completely original and smart from beginning to end.The Babadook himself appears when Amelia reads her son a bedtime story based on him. She finds the book disturbing and gets rid of it, until it starts to stalk her from the book, which where the psychological thrill ride falls into place.I highly recommend this film if you're looking for something fresh in the horror genre. It's a film with actual scares which is enough for me. I'm hoping this film inspires other movies to be made to actually try to not treat people like 6 year old girls and focus on the psychological part of it.",8,4,10,28 December 2014
Spider-Man 2," Best Spider-man film!
","This is an extremely rare instance in a comic book film where everything, and I mean everything is done right! The characters are developed perfectly, the villain is perfect, the story is perfect, etc.Tobey Maguire continues to amaze me with his Peter Parker. We feel so much sympathy for him because of him struggling to be Spider-man on top of holding down 2 jobs, college courses, and keeping in touch with his friends, not to mention his love for Mary Jane, which he has to hide for her protection. The villain is Otto Octavius, who soon becomes Doc Oc after an accident involving sustained fusion, causing four mechanical arms to stick themselves as part of his body.The film manages to keep the conflicts at a settled pace, showing details of all the people in his life, and how they're all affecting his performance as Spider-man, which starts cause him to lose his powers. Even though it feels like a whole lot, the editing makes it feel incredibly smooth so no scenes drag on. The mourning of Uncle Ben, Harry's hate for Spider-man, his relationship with Mary Jane, Aunt May's bank issues is all shown in perfect detail without being overlong or overblown. The action is still really nice, the effects are much better in this one.Honestly, I don't have any complaints, this film pretty much hit everything. The drama, the comedy, and the fantasy is all there. Not only is this the best Spider-man film, but this is my second favorite comic book film of all time. Whether or not you're a comic book fan, I highly recommend it.",9,0,1,26 June 2010
Spotlight," A film that does its job without feeling the need to add more.
","Spotlight, the four person team working for the Boston Globe, investigates into the repeated acts of priests sexually abusing children over the course of 30 years, resulting in the unfolding of hidden secrets that this team desperately determined to reveal.Compelling, investing, and brilliantly detailed account of a story that people tried to hide for so long. This film goes into so much detail about the emotional distress, the determination from the team, the struggle with the legal system in getting the truth out, etc. The ensemble cast is well picked out, with everybody doing a great job. Mark Ruffalo and Rachel Mcadams both give Oscar worthy performances, and Michael Keaton was surprisingly amazing, showing that Birdman was not a one time hit for him.For a touchy subject matter like this, It's really risky to put it out there, as some people (including the Academy) don't like films with uncomfortable topics. This film handled it so perfectly and so maturely that it deserves every bit of credibility. It's very historically accurate, resisting the temptation to make the main characters out to be superheroes that save the day, but instead just portrays them as people simply doing their jobs, which is what this movie does. It doesn't go out of its way to blow itself up bigger than it is, or try to establish any bit of greater importance, it simply does its job, and does it great. It is completely airtight, there is no fat on this film whatsoever. Every scene is escalating the plot further in some way, and is packed full of the meat of the story, which I savored every little bit of.Tightly written, tightly edited, tightly acted, and tightly directed, this is a unique and impressive quality film that will inspire you until the end.",9,2,3,28 February 2016
Spider-Man 3," Not bad.
","A lot of people hate this film for several reasons. Yes they were pretty convincing reasons, but it didn't destroy the whole film for me either. I enjoyed the action scenes, which is the main lead to enjoying an 'action' film, the story was all right, even though it could have had less plot holes, the characters were decent enough, and it followed nicely with the comics.The villains could have been better though. Not that I didn't want them in there, they just could have been better developed. I was excited as heck when I found out that Venom was going to be in there. When I saw it in theaters, that was what I was looking forward to the entire film. Then when it finally got to him, I was utterly disappointed. 2 minutes and 30 seconds total screen time with Venom, not counting when he's got his face lashed back into Eddie Brock. And how much time do we get with the Sandman, like a lot more. Their screen time should have been switched. Heck, they could have done the film without Sandman. What was he needed for? Did they really need the subplot of Sandman really killing uncle Ben? I don't think so.The romantic struggle between Peter and Mary Jane, although a little stupid, still gets a lot of emotion put into the film. And the New Goblin, aka Harry, who loses his memory after an accident, forgets that he wants Peter dead, which regains his friendship with him.We also get introduced to the symbiote, who becomes attached to Peter's Spider-Man outfit, and slowly tortures him into insanity, turning him from a pathetic nerd to a ruthless emo person. The two dumbest things in this film are emo Peter, and the dance scene.Emo Peter is supposed to be tortured by the suit, yet he's hopelessly addicted to it. Yet soon after he gets it, a montage of him walking around the street acting goofy to each girl that comes by, is just plain silly. The dance scene is the worst. A scene where we jumps around a jazz club, swinging on lamps and sliding on chairs. It looks like a deleted scene from the movie Chicago. Its hard to see the pain he goes through when he's jumping around dancing. The scene did not have to be that silly, nor did the Emo Peter scene have to be.Still though, the action was great, the characters and dialogue went well, the emotion throughout the entire film is just great, and it follows through with the comics almost perfectly. Although they could have had a lot more Venom time, and a lot less plot holes, it still holds out as a perfectly good comic book based film. Despite it being the worst of the series, its still a watchable film that I can see anytime.",7,0,4,26 June 2010
Cloverfield," Old B-movie horror films resurrected from the dead.
","This was an amazing thriller that brought back the B-movie genre in my opinion. Though I gotta say this probably beats the B movies back then. This one doesn't show the monster as much, making the suspense all the more terrifying. Then when you do see the monster, you'll see that it's an amazingly creative design, and not a typical Godzilla design.Note: (the whole movie is shot in a first-person perspective). During a going away party, a group of friends encounter a giant monster attacking New York City, in which they evacuate the place, and try to get out of New York, doing what they can to stay alive.I say this is better than most B horror films because of the unique way it's shot. The film is filmed by a guy going with the party, and you feel warped into the environment with so much commotion going on, it's uncanny. The film's ending also isn't what you expect, (you'll see). The film doesn't get slow, as there's always something going on, and the main characters are always on their feet. It begins in suspense, and it slowly but surely shows more and more of the monster, getting more and more intense. It's scary because it's huge, so how can you miss it, yet not seeing all of it just makes the environment feel all that more real. Growing attached to the characters makes it more terrifying when they die one by one.This film gave the B movie genre some balls, and I appreciate it for that. Nothing is cheesy, nothing is bad, everything is thrilling to the bone. Very decent film",7,0,1,28 August 2010
The Hateful Eight," One of Tarantino's heaviest films.
","This is a Tarantino film that emphasizes every bit of content in this film. The characters, the environment, the food they eat, the liquor they drink, etc. Nothing in this film is not addressed in some point or another. One of his most dialogue heavy films, and one of his most gruesome films as well.Everybody in this film gave an amazing performance. Has one of my favorite Samuel Jackson characters ever, followed by the phenomenally cast Jennifer Jason Leigh and Kurt Russell, making for a great duo. Michael Madsen and Tim Roth were a little underplayed but still fun to watch. The cinematic view is glorious, even if it is all mostly shot in a cabin. Though few, the shots of mountains with horseback carriages in the distance makes for some beautiful scenery. Once again, this has one of the longest screenplays in any other Tarantino. Every scene has at least five fifteen minute discussions about a backstory, or some food or the cabin or the owners of the cabin. Many critics have considered it one of his slowest movies, though it is filled with story and it makes you feel informed throughout.Hateful Eight is right, because this is one of the most hateful, mean spirited movies ever, with probably the highest number of N- words in any movie. Even those who have an understanding are at each other's throats in this. There is zero friendliness in here. I will admit I was hoping for less white and black confrontation in this, since that's a big discussion in the film, and it feels worn at this moment in Tarantino's career.Overall, It's very different from what he's done in the past, and it's better than his two recent films. Even though it isn't perfect, it's a story to remember with some very colorful characters and plot.",8,29,77,31 December 2015
Crash," Brilliant work of art!
","A story of racism like I've never seen it before. A film that I think greatly portrays the modern world in terms of different races and ethnic groups. Not like the others such as Dances with Wolves or Pocahontas I assure you. This one is much more moving with the characters and the plot, progressing further and further.A modern story taking place 2 days, in which different racial conflicts arise throughout the city of L.A as several characters must deal with different situations of racism, as they learn more about themselves that they didn't realize before.At the introduction of each character, I immediately cared about every one of them more and more until the very end where I fell crying at their conclusions. Heart felt and emotionally inspirational film of the year. Brilliant cast includes Sandra Bullock, Matt Dillon, Don Cheadle, etc. Incredible performances all around. The acting literally brings out the character in every single person. Even Ludicrous, portraying a black sociopath gives an incredible performance.The editing and music are so intense that I was mind blown all over the place. Every scene had me on edge, even the silent ones. I cared about every single character, every single situation, and payed full attention to every scene.Oscar winner for best picture, despite living under the shadow of Brokeback Mountain in several people's opinions. It's really a hit or miss. Most like it, then the small amount who don't care for it. Me on the other hand...I simply find it amazing. Everything about it from beginning to end pleased me. Masterpiece of film making and character studying. Simply amazing!",10,1,6,23 April 2010
The Expendables," Best action film of 2010!
","This is what you get when you think of a movie where all the most badass action heroes in the world unite together to form the greatest action film of all time. This film doesn't need to focus on good acting, good screenplay, or any of that. Just put an awesome cast in there, and you know the movies automatically gonna be awesome! I mean the list is endless. Nobody beats these guys. Their the best around, nothings gonna ever keep them down.The story is nothing to get excited over. Basically, a team of bad- asses called the Expendables are called in to save a ruined city being terrorized by terrorists. Stallone and his partner meet up with this girl, and escape in a hurry, leaving her behind. The enemy thinks they've won. But he left just to come back with his whole team for a rescue mission.Just like in Rambo, it all comes down to the end, where most of the action is. Only its a little more organized than Rambo. In Rambo, body after body get mangled to bits. Don't get me wrong, I love that. But the Expendable's style is a little better. Every fatality in that movie just gives you goosebumps. At the beginning, I didn't really like it that much, it just went a little too slow. But once it gets started, its the coolest thing you'll ever see.The true thing that makes this movie is the cast. If it were any other pair of guys, it wouldn't be as good. These guys are the true American bad-asses. Their the biggest, the baddest, and the best of all time, making this one of the greatest action film ever made.",7,3,7,27 December 2010
Interstellar," Good, not great.
","I definitely went into this film expecting to love it, because I am such a Nolan fan. Also just by looking at it you can tell it was made to be great. In the end, I still enjoyed it, but I was slightly disappointed, expecting a tad more. It was nowhere near as disappointed as The Dark Knight Rises, but I felt like it was missing something.The story tells of astronauts going on a secret NASA mission to travel to a wormhole in space to a different galaxy in order to find a habitable planet for humanity, which is in danger of being killed off. McConaughey is a farmer/scientific engineer who finds the secret NASA mission with the help of his almost equally smart daughter. Like most Nolan screenplays, it's extremely scientific and complex. I'd argue this one goes a little over his head, he's trying Way too hard to be smart.The chemistry between McConaughey and his daughter is easily the best part about this film. His ability to cry gets me choked up every time, though he can do much more than that. Combine that with a weeping daughter, and you got a tear jerker. McConaughey does an amazing acting job in this one, he's just so likable all around. The rest of the performances are nice, but the character development is sloppy at times, or it's being distracted by scientific exposition.This is easily his weakest film, aside from being too scientific, it's just not as creative or imaginative as his Inception, or as realistically interesting like The Dark Knight. He just gets so lost in his Nolan mode that he just goes with whatever. I will say the plot near the end is set up very well, even if it does drag on a tad. This film could have easily been 2 hours or a little more. It did not have to be 3. So much of the film could have been trimmed.I enjoyed it as a whole, but it's one of the weaker films I've seen this year. It's still Nolan so it doesn't suck or anything, it gets by, but that's about it. For what I was expecting, I was wanting more, for what I got, I would still recommend it highly.",7,0,2,28 December 2014
Full Metal Jacket," Kubrick's vision of Vietnam, not what you expected.
","Like for real most Vietnam films are dark and demeaning, Platoon, The Deer Hunter, Apocalypse Now etc. Now it's Kubrick's turn, director of Clockwork Orange, Eyes Wide Shut and The Shining. Even though it's not really a comedy, this is the lightest Vietnam film iv'e seen, and it came from Kubrick, WTF.The first 45 minutes of the film actually start off where you wouldn't expect, boot camp. The first 45 minutes shows R. Lee Ermey, a drill sergeant, train a very unlucky group of trainees into preparation for the Vietnam war, with his tough as nails brute force. Although it takes the perspective of pretty much everybody, the main focus is Private Pyle, who's overweight body causes much dismay and trouble for him, angering the drill sergeant to no end. It greatly shows how much hell boot camp, as well as the war can put someone through.Afterwards, it jumps into the actual war, which follows a couple of the soldiers from the first half, and introduces some new ones. The characters are very colorful and memorable, and perfectly display the reality of attitude for the war.Kubrick's vision, in my opinion was to give an ironic twist comparison to boot camp and the war. In the film, it seems as if the boot camp is 10x worse than the war, because a lot of the war is just them hanging out and drinking. There are lots of battle scenes, but still. As I said before, Kubrick's vision wasn't what I thought it was. I guess since everybody else all ready had dark and gloomy Vietnam war films, he figured he'd go another route and knock us off guard with a lighter film. Although it's not necessarily a comedy, it has moments of goofiness that I couldn't believe he added in there.A lot of people say the first 45 minutes are the only parts worth watching, because they're the rarest ones that we haven't seen before, and I used to agree. Although I do like the first half better, I do appreciate the work with the other half as well, which has some very intense parts that do manage to differ from other battle scenes in other films.Even though not the heaviest Vietnam war film, it still manages to catch the eye of interest. Out of all the directors of Vietnam films, how did Kubrick's vision become the lightest one? That being said, this is probably the rarest one, with the most unique features in it, which I do appreciate. Definitely worth checking out, even though the first 45 minutes are better, the rest still remains decent, for a decent film.",7,0,1,9 June 2012
American Sniper," Best Bradley Cooper performance since The Place Beyond the Pines
","Clint Eastwood is a master director, so right away I expected this to be good. I did not, however, expect to be as blown away by Bradley Cooper's performance as I was. Don't get me wrong, he's great, and he's apparently with Meryl Streep in getting nominated once a year, but I was not expecting him to be this good. His portrayal of American NAVY Seal sniper Chris Kyle who goes through four tours while struggling to cope with the horrors of war during the time with his wife and kids is possibly his best performance to date.Clint Eastwood never fails to impress. The directing is incredibly sharp, probably the best thing about this film. He takes a couple risks by being a little less subtle in certain moments. There are a lot of action scenes in this, but it's edited very well, showing us the war and its impact at home, even if it doesn't last very long. We got to see some interesting shots we don't usually see in Clint's film, like the airstrike close up shots, or the CGI helicopter in full view.Bradley Cooper portrays an American soldier whose duty it is to kill in the most realistic way imagined. He is on fire in this! The scene where he almost kills the kid with the RPG, his expressions and reactions are spot on!I did enjoy the editing, but sometimes it went a little too much. Scenes are occasionally cut short after lasting like 10 seconds. Not to mention there's a scene that cuts away while they're getting shot at like, 'um okay, I guess the terrorists got bored and went home'. I would say the film could have shown a little more of Bradley Cooper trying to adapt to his life rather than just 2 minutes of that then 10 more minutes of action, but it's so well filmed it doesn't bother as much.I highly recommend this film if you're patriotic, or if you love Eastwood. This is a must see, the film that The Hurt Locker should have been.",8,17,41,17 January 2015
Forrest Gump," One of the best films of all time
","For the longest time this was my favorite film. Even though it isn't anymore it's definitely in the top 5. I've seen this film so many times, I could recite the whole thing. This film made Robert Zemeckis one of my favorite directors, and Tom Hanks was all ready one of my favorite actors, so this really helped.Tom Hanks is so charming as the simple minded Forrest Gump, who, growing up in the 60's, 70's and 80's, inadvertently becomes involved with the key moments of the 20th century, including Vietnam, Watergate, winning a Medal of Honor, meeting multiple celebrities, etc. He goes through life simply doing what his mamma, (Sally Field) and his best friend Jenny, (Robin Wright) tell him.This film has some of the best quotes of all time, the main one being 'Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get'. This film has so much going on. It's so inspirational, teaching you so many lessons on life.Robert Zemeckis cleverly plays around with history, adding Forrest into key moments through great visuals and photoshopping, or just plain playacting. The visuals are really great if you know what you're looking at. The music score by Alan Silverstri will get you crying more than once. The soundtrack ranges from the 50's to the 80's, milking the biggest artists of those years as the decades flow through.Possibly Tom Hank's best performance as Forrest. He can be funny, but he can also be strong willed and confident. Robin Wright is a great supporting character, being Forrest's main push in the movie to keep going. Sally Field as Forrest's mamma is also really supporting, raising him on his own at birth and supporting his decisions. More characters are introduced throughout, like Bubba, Forrest's friend in Vietnam, and Lieutenant Dan, (Gary Sinise) Forrest's Lieutenant in the war.There's so much in this film, it's such a long but fun journey. I highly recommend this if you're looking for a really good inspirational feel good movie.",9,2,3,26 June 2010
American Hustle," Slightly over-hyped, yet still one entertaining piece.
","Knowing David O Russell's style, I knew going into this that I was going to have to deal with some over the top quirkiness in the characters and style, which I can usually tolerate in his films. On one hand, he handles his actors extremely well with top notch directing and handles his script very carefully as well. On the other hand, he lets his style slip out of his hands and spill out all over the screen in an over abundance of random bantering from characters, and depraved scenes of sexual frustration that get played off as comedic.Christian Bale and Amy Adams are two con artists who are forced by an FBI agent (Bradley Cooper) to set up an elaborate sting operation on corrupt politicians, including the mayor of Camden, New Jersey (Jeremy Renner). Meanwhile, he has to deal with his estranged wife (Jennifer Lawrence) who constantly gets in the way of his plans. I was invested because this is the first time David O Russell has tackled crime drama. He still manages to blend black comedic undertones with the colorful, sporadic writing on the surface.The casting and performances are probably the film's biggest strong suit. Christian Bale is hilarious and convincingly serious at the same time. Anytime he's on screen, he squeezes every last drop of investment into his character that the scene calls for, and it pays off. When he gets upset, angry, or scared, you really see it on his face. In a film like this that's really flashy, it's amazing how much emotion he displays while the audience is getting energized by the soundtrack. Amy Adams is sexy and deceitful, which we get out of every single scene she's in. Bradly Cooper is quickly becoming one of the most promising actors in this day in age. He is unpredictable in every scene he's in, but he manages to keep it straight and real at the same time. Jennifer Lawrence is unstoppable, portraying yet another emotionally distressed woman with husband problems, and no filter on her mouth. The only thing I wasn't sure about was the random Robert De Niro cameo.One main issue I do have with the film is that the style, while entertaining, distracts from the plot. I usually encourage this behavior from Russell in previous works, but this time it left me a tad overwhelmed. It hammered itself in scenes that were completely unnecessary. The film went on a tad too long, and definitely could have trimmed some scenes that were needlessly thrown in there for stylistic purposes. The writing is solid, but the quirky character trope just throws me off at times and makes it hard to focus.Overall, the film really energizes and excites you in each scene, making for one very entertaining film. I feel like a few people love the flashy style, which I can appreciate, even if it distracts a little. For that reason, I find it a tad over hyped, but not enough to take away any enjoyment. Russell is getting more mainstream, which is showcasing in his films. I just hope it doesn't get to his head, and I look forward to what he can do in the future.",7,0,2,6 June 2016
Fargo," My favorite Coen film of all time.
","This my favorite, and the best Coen film of all time. Even though it's a fairly simplistic story, it has comedic elements of all sorts. Frances McDormand as a pregnant Minnesota cop investigates homicides that are connected to a family man hiring hit-man to kidnap his wife to collect the ransom money from his rich father-in-law.The story is told fairly straightforward, with extremely funny jabs at Minnesota culture, particularly on their accents. The funniest is the jabs at Steve Buschemi being described as nothing but funny looking, really goes to show how the Coens feel. William H. Macy as the husband of the kidnapped woman is a nervous mess in every scene he's in, going out of his way to cover up anything that goes wrong. Steve Buschemi is an absolute riot every time he's on screen, being a bumbling screw up in almost everything he does.This is the best Coen film because it is not only a comedy, but it's a comedy of different varieties. If you tried to explain why these scenes are funny, you couldn't because they're that clever. Very recommended!",9,1,2,1 December 2015
Predator," Good effects and action, but recycled story and somewhat rushed.
","I honestly didn't have much of an intention to watch this, but my brother forced me into it, and I went ahead and saw it. It was your typical average action film, explosions, gun fights, and gore up the butt. Although it does include a few different things, its a basic system that I've already seen over and over. Not that I didn't like it, but its the same repetitive action that has been done already.Arnold Schwarzenegger and a team of mercenaries set out in the jungles of Guatemala to investigate a group of missing mercenaries, along with taking out a campsite of Guerrillas. But their mission becomes a survival mission when they become the prey of an evil creature from space, which has the ability to camouflage itself.You can count on this film for giving you good action and explosions, but what you can't count on this film for is freshly made ideas for the story that you've never heard of before. It starts right away, and gets into the conflict right away. The film isn't long enough to make any stops. It just keeps going on.The film is quite gory for an eighties film, but it just makes it into another one of those shocker films that tries to shock you as much as possible. Don't get me wrong, it is quite graphic, and it pulls it off most of the time. But the film's main problem is not having enough time to stop, or some kind of different idea other than constant running and action. No expectations, just a little more different than other action films.",6,0,3,22 August 2010
Nightcrawler," Solid script, solid performances, but for some reason it felt empty.
","I came into this expecting a performance of a lifetime with a very creepy story. Jake Gyllanhal does a great job, (even if he's not as creepy as I thought he'd be) and the script is smooth and solid, but the film tries the whole time to be terrifyingly creepy, but is just kind of so so.It does do a good job of grounding you in reality on the bloody crime of Los Angelos, and the nightcrawling TV reporters that go out of their way to get good shots for the news. It explores the fine line between doing your job and disrespecting and exploiting the dead for your own personal gain, but in the end it didn't leave as much of an impact.All this talk about how Jake should have been nominated, I disagree. He was really good, not as creepy as I thought. He's smart talking and clever, but he doesn't leave enough of an impact to get you thinking.A lot of the movie was me waiting for something to happen. It sets up the character and motivation well, it sets you in the right mood, but a lot of it was just me waiting for it to change. In the end with a few crazy twists here and there, I for some reason was not very intrigued. I guess the film is trying so hard to be creepy based on it's strong contrast in lighting, with a really dark toned film, but in the end it's not that creepy of a film. This kind of story could almost be a comedy or drama, not a dark thriller.I give it props for its clever screenplay and decent performances, but I was hoping for something a tad bit more. Not bad, but was missing something.",6,2,4,26 February 2015
Man of Steel," Best comic book character origin film!
","Seeing this in the midnight showing in Imax 3D really impacted my opinion on this film. I enjoyed it quite a bit! Not being a hardcore Superman fan, watching his origin story from birth to being raised, and learning of his difficult past really made me appreciate Superman a lot more. Love the message about the great unknown in the world and the fear it gives off, such as Superman, except when he proves them wrong and becomes the hero.Zod, the villain, was badass as Hell. His intentions aren't really that selfish or evil, yet he goes to such lengths to conquer them. He basically wants to recreate Crypton, his and Superman's home planet, by destroying Earth, and creating it on that. So, he really isn't being self centered on anything specifically evil. One thing I was disappointed in is that he never said 'bow down before Zod'. Was really hoping for that.Half of the film goes straight in depth to the origin story, while the other half is focused on fighting Zod, (which takes up a fourth of the film, and is sooooo awesome!) I also love the amount of Russell Crowe screen time as Superman's dad. Even when he dies, they manage to put him in the movie as a chip that Superman can access to produce a hologram of his dad, to which the dad can interact with him accordingly.Of course the performances: All did great! The beautiful Amy Adams as Lois Lane perfectly poses the risk taking damsel who becomes Superman's star of affection. Henry Cavill is probably the best Superman up to date, he's so confident in what he's doing with everything.I enjoyed this film from beginning to end, and I would definitely check it out again, to try and get more out of the story, maybe take a look at some comics before hand. But it's definitely worth seeing.",8,0,0,14 June 2013
28 Weeks Later," Inferior to the first
","A downgraded sequel to 28 Days Later, it manages to look and play the same, but it just doesn't live up to the first, not to mention its nowhere near as scary.Instead of 28 days, its now been 28 weeks since the virus broke out. People are returning to London, for its been secured from the virus, and is ready to return to its original life, although still under surveillance of the U.S. Army.There's a deeper plot where a woman turns out to be a carrier of the Rage virus, and comes in contact with one other person, which spreads more and more until mostly everyone is infected. This leads the U.S. Army to have no choice but to kill off anybody they see, even civilians that aren't infected, for a precaution to make sure the virus doesn't spread again.Thats one thing I thought was incredibly stupid. The army becomes the main enemy, not the virus, which makes it nowhere near as creepy or thrilling. Its a lot more gory, and has a lot more shaky camera, but it doesn't make it that scary, no matter what.I did like the characters though, but when it comes to surviving from the virus and army, not much character development is available, though I did like Jeremy Renner's character. This won't be the last character Renner plays thats in the army.This film is mostly for the horror film gore lovers. But if your looking for a good psychological thriller, than this isn't for you. Its not terrible, but its inferiorness to the first just makes it wanna not exist.",6,2,3,27 December 2010
The Revenant," One of the most visually intricate films I've ever seen.
","After being mauled by a bear during a hunting expedition in the 1820's, fur trader Andrew Henry (Leonardo Dicaprio) is left for dead and buried alive after his half breed son is killed by John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), resulting in a fierce and brutal struggle for survival as he attempts to make his way back to civilization for revenge against Fitzgerald.Opening with a visually masterful fight scene between the hunting crew and the Arikara tribes, Alejandro Inarritu brilliantly captures (through extended takes and natural lighting) the complete feeling of being in the freezing wilderness. From walking in the rain to running in the snow, you feel every single nit bit of detail within the scene. Like Birdman, he likes to capture everything in one, making for a very strong directing job.Overall, it is rich with environment, which is its main factor. Leo spends most of his time in the wilderness on his own, trying to survive. His desperation increases more and more as you see him progressively determined. From sleeping inside a horse to eating rotten boar flesh, Leo goes all out in here and is completely immersed in every scene he's in. I wish Tom Hardy got more screen time, there was some good potential for a very unique character study. Even though it was still good, I feel like they might have missed out.Even though style over substance is usually not good, this is one of the most masterfully filmed movies I have ever seen. It makes me wonder how they got some of these shots. Compliments to them for the use of natural lighting, which is a good touch, and really pays off. I wish Alejandro did what he did in Birdman, and have more dream sequences, and more spiritual scenery to add to the gritty feeling. Once you factor out the detailed environment and long structure of it all, what you get is a pretty basic revenge story. With that said, it is so technically marvelous it overshadows it completely.Regardless of its few complaints, it is one of the most riveting experiences I've ever had with a film. Watch in on Blu-Ray, on an HDTV, turn out the lights and turn on the surround sound, and get ready to travel to a new world, because this is the movie to do it.",8,1,3,28 February 2016
The Hills Have Eyes," Decent remake, okay film.
","Nobody really expected any higher of this depressing remake to Wes Craven's 1977 horror film. Although it does follow the first quite well, the film itself could have been less depressing, and more frightening. Its set on what kind of horror your into. The psychological type, or the gory type. For this, its a little of both. But a lot of key things in this are taken away for its own pleasure. But it still holds out.The story is about an American family who become stranded in the middle of the New Mexico desert, where they become the prey of cannibalistic mutated humans living in the hills.Similar characters, similar dialogue, and similar events to the original, this one brings a different approach that the other one did. Brought up the gore, and simplified the dialogue. Goes a little overboard with the blood and violence, and the scenes go on to the very end until your ready to call it quits. But if you stay throughout the whole film, its not that hard.A few fatalities are entertaining. But the scenes for this film become not much, and don't seem that long. The first half is them becoming stranded, and getting attacked by the mutants. The second half, all the way to the end is hunting down the mutants. It just turns into a slaughterhouse.Not that this takes away from the film, but these guys are pussies. A guy with a gun runs away from one of the mutants chasing him. Try shooting him! It would be so awesome to bring the Dawn of the Dead guys in there, and take care of all of them easily. Its like, stand aside and make way for these guys. They would all gun them down in no time.Like I said before, it as a remake is good. As for it as an actual film, its not that bad, but its not that good. It has its flaws, but overall its watchable. If you have seen the first and are curious, give it a viewing. If you haven't, then still go ahead. Its not like you absolutely have to watch the original first. Just avoid the sequels. They suck!",6,1,1,31 December 2010
Silver Linings Playbook," Was a lot better than I thought.
","Did not know too much about this film before I saw it, and I honestly didn't hear too many good things about it. Aside from the critical acclaim from all the hot critics, and the Oscars, people I knew said it was kind of pretentious. While I'll admit it is that a little bit, I enjoyed the heck out of this film. The story is very interesting, and stays focused throughout, and the performances by Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence are amazing.Pat, (Bradley Cooper) leaves an institution eight months after being diagnosed bipolar, and when he nearly beat his wife's lover to death. Now free, he moves in with his parents, (Robert De Niro, Jacki Weaver) and attempts to get his life in order, trying to get in contact with his wife Nikki, (Brea Bree) who has filed a restraining order against him. His life takes a drastic turn when he develops a friendship with his good friend's sister-in-law Tiffany, (Jennifer Lawrence) who has similar medical problems as him, after her husband died.Cooper's bipolar character, while being very crazy and psychotic, (shown in several scenes) makes you feel very sorry for him, and you want to see him get better. Despite what happens, I always felt for him, and cared about him. The same goes with his parents, who are worried about their son's well being, and his good friend Danny, (Chris Tucker) who has troubles leaving the institution.The performances are very amazing. Jennifer Lawrence, while being a psychotic nut, also has a lot of emotional scenes that you reach out to, as you learn of her past.The story always manages to keep you focused on what's going on, and never leaves anybody behind. The film itself is very fast-paced and quickly edited, but it slows down when it calls for an important scene. It never gets slow though, every scene is either emotionally charming, or dramatically intense.When people called this pretentious, I sort of saw what they meant, but not that much. Like I guess at the end when she sees him talking to his wife, and automatically assumes he's with her. Then he chases her, revealing that a note supposedly given to him by his wife was written by her, and that he's loved her since the day he met her, and they fall in love. I suppose that was a little pretentious, but it's not that noticeable. You don't focus on whats all ready been done. You just focus on how it all works out in this film. He loves her because they have similar problems, and they connect perfectly. You find out that he is okay without his wife, and he wants her. Nothing is really wrong with that, but at the same time, they could have done it with a little more creatively, but it's whatever. It's still beautifully written. Even though some dialogue is just thrown in for the sake of keeping the pace of the film, there were some scenes where I was literally getting goosebumps by how funny or clever the dialogue was. The film's comic parts can get really funny, just on how goofy and needlessly intense they are.So aside from a couple of pretentious plots, this film was so good. I enjoyed it from beginning to end, and I would definitely see it again, not only because I laughed and was amazed by it, but also to see that Jennifer Lawrence booty shake in that dance scene...mmmmm.",8,1,2,5 May 2013
Spider-Man," Such a fun film
","I love these films! Even though they're not the most honoring to the comics, they're still fun, colorful, and unique to watch. Even if you don't read the comics, the film gives you enough to recognize the main parts of the comics, such as the characters, the settings, and of course, the villain.Tobey Maguire plays a miraculous Peter Parker and Spider-man. He's such a nerd, which makes you feel all the more happy for him when he's kicking the ass of every crook on the street. The build up for gaining his powers, the death of Uncle Ben, and the birth of Spider-man is done incredibly well. The villain is the Green Goblin, played by Willem Dafoe, who is also built up real well.The relationship is actually with Mary Jane Watson instead of Gwen Stacy, like the comics have it. I'm not going to lie, i'm not the biggest fan of Mary Jane, all she seems to do is get in trouble and have to be saved, not really Kirsten Dunst's fault, that's just what Sam Raimi wanted. She herself doesn't do a bad job, but she sure does scream a lot. You still care a lot about her, since Peter loves her so much.The film is very colorful and adventurous, the costume is very traditional, but looks so nice. The cinematography is smooth, and swinging around with Spider-man is so fun because you just feel like it's you swinging from building to building. The music by Danny Elfman is, what I consider to be a classic music score. The effects are standard early 21st century CGI, which isn't bad, but some scenes are painfully obvious that they're CGI. Either way I have much respect for this film. It's a film before it's a comic book, therefore it decides it doesn't need to follow the comics so closely to be successful. If you're a hardcore fan of the comics, then this might not be your cup of tea, but if you're looking for a solid comic book action film, then look no further, because this is one of the best comic book films of all time.",8,0,1,25 June 2010
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," A slight improvement over the second.
","I liked this one better than the second one. I don't know what it was, but something about this movies tone and mood, as well as the way it was crafted together gave me a better feeling for it. Now directed by a new director, a lot of things have changed, including the cinematography, the visuals, the plots, and altogether the directing. This one is more adventurous, more loose, more fitting with the book, and a lot more progressing.Harry's third year consists of a serial killer whose escaped from Azkaban named Sirius Black, (Gary Oldman) trying to find and kill him. This causes Harry to be extra cautious this year, trying to avoid both him, and the dreadful dementors of Azkaban trying to find Sirius as well. Like I said, progresses the series quite well. The first two were very similar together, with similar looks, settings, and costumes. This one goes a little less decorative, but still exciting.The music score is still by John Williams, which will never die. The plot holes are a lot more clean, and the suspense is 10x bigger. Its also a lot more emotional, talking a lot about Harry's parents, as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Lupin, was a good friend of James and Lily Potter.Doesn't refer to the other as much, but maybe thats a good thing, to focus more on the main plot. Also has really cool new material in it, introducing us to new and magical things that you wish you could do.Still could have a little bit more to it. Still doesn't compete with the original one, but still one of the top ones of the series.",7,0,0,2 December 2010
The Amazing Spider-Man," Pretty pointless reboot.
","Why was this made? I ask you, why? We know the story and there is nothing wrong with how it was told in the Sam Raimi versions, so why? to be darker and please the comic fans, or to make more money. Hmm...how bout both. Seriously, this does nothing more than change the cast around and tell the story quicker, nothing more.Andrew Garfield plays an okay Spider-Man with the wise cracking and confidence etc, but his Peter Parker does not hold a candle to Tobey Maguire. He plays it more normal and straightforward, rather than nerdy, which is what Peter Parker is. Gwen Stacey is a huge improvement over Mary Jane which I liked, but their chemistry starting out is awkward and stupid. The villain is a friend of Peter's dad, Curt Connors, who develops a serum that could grow back his arm, but instead turns him into a horrible looking CGI lizard. Although the fights with the lizard are unique and he isn't the worst Spider-man villain we've seen, he's still ugly as sh*t and dies pretty simply. The film is style over substance, and the style is not that interesting. It's dull and it's trying too hard to change the way it tells the story. Nothing stood out that I haven't all ready seen. The death of Uncle Ben is not only brushed aside like nothing, but he's not even what motivates Peter to become Spider- Man. No, it's Denis Leary playing the police chief, and Gwen's father.When something stylized in the film works, it works well enough to get by, but definitely not enough to really enjoy. Would not recommend unless you're a big fan of the comics.",5,1,3,3 May 2014
American History X," Speechless.
","As in i'm speechless for how much of an impact this film gave me. I could not believe how much this movie blew me away. From start to finish, I was glued. Nothing about this film disappointed me or that I thought was stupid about it. Every element was stunning and amazing. All I can say is, i'm simply speechless.Finally, a film that doesn't follow the typical 'don't be racist' message. Yes, it has that, but in a completely different way and tone. It's brought out different as well.Story: Edward Norton is a Neo-Nazi civil leader who's anger and mean spirit towards immigrants leads him to murder two African Americans, sentencing him to 3 years in prison. Out in the open 3 years later, a changed Edward decides to change his life, starting by preventing his younger brother, (Edward Furlong) from going down the same path he has.The film is mostly told in a flashback perspective, introducing what causes Edward to visit prison, what inspired his anger, and how prison changes him.Edward Norton's performance is the god of all performances. Not only should he have won the Oscar for best actor, but it shouldn't be the least bit close to any of the others. Unbelievably convincing and inspiring, and flawlessly carries out his role. His performance made this movie. It completely resembled everything this movie stood for. No words can describe how much his performance inspired me. I'm confused on how it's even possible that a performance could be as good as this. He nailed this performance from beginning to end.Edward Furlong excellently transforms from a little trouble making punk to a changed, and well understood boy who learns to appreciate other races.I'm not going to say a thing about the ending. All i'm going to say is that it is a gigantic slap in the face. Regardless, it gets the message around very clear, and manages to stay professional. Although not the ending you may expect, it is still a very nice and perfect conclusion to the film.This is just the brink of what I can say about this film. The performances, the story, and the all around film was just nailed perfectly. The film, from beginning to end, knows what it's doing, and does it...brilliantly. This film is a must to see. See it, because this film impacted my life greatly, and made me look very differently on life. I'm so glad I saw this film. I don't know if i'd see it again, because something as beautifully done as this doesn't come around very often, and I would not want to make it tiring, ever. Maybe one other time years later. All I can simply say is that this film left me speechless, but my mind filled. I thank this movie, and all responsible for it's creation.",10,1,2,28 June 2012
District 9," Explosive, creative, and entertaining alien film.
","Very creative alien film that isn't another hand-me-down from the original alien invasion story. Creative story, awesome action, great characters, and an all together fun ride.Shot as a documentary, the film at first explains how 20 years ago from 2002 an alien aircraft came out of nowhere and hovered over the city of Johannesburg, South Africa, where the military found aliens on board, more specifically named 'prawn'. It eventually leads to them creating a slum like location for them to stay on Earth called District 9. It then introduces the main character named Wikus Van De Merwe, who works for MNU to lead the aliens out of D9 and into a different location. During which, he becomes infected by a fluid that starts to turns him into a prawn. Eventually, he is pursued by MNU to obtain his organs to allow them to use the prawn weaponry that can only be used by prawn. He makes friends with a fellow prawn whose goal with the fluid over a period of 20 years was to use it to program a secret underground ship and use it to escape, which could also turn Wikus back into a human. They then team up to obtain the fluid.As the story progresses, you feel more for the main character, and eventually, you even feel for the prawn, which is pretty impressive. Visuals are stunning as can be, with both the prawn, the explosions, and the ship. All put together is simply breathtaking. Though the action gets a tiny bit uncreative, there are definitely some very clever action moments, which just makes you get goosebumps.Even though it would have been nice for Peter Jackson to do the Halo movie instead of this, this still turned out pretty decent.Though I have to say, seeing it the first time is the best time. If you try to see it again, it may not be as good, but still, thats just for me. I saw it a bunch of other times, and it just wasn't as good. But for the movie in general, its a well balanced action film that knows what its doing.",7,1,9,5 July 2010
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Improvement over the first one
","I did not hate the first, I enjoyed it for the most part, but it had its issues. This movie resolved most of those issues. It's much more polished, focused, and a stronger structured film all together.Taking where the first one left off, Bilbo and his dwarf team continue toward Lonely Mountain to reclaim it against the dragon Smaug.Right away it starts the film by building in the tension of Smaug, which immediately puts us in build up mode, as the journey becomes more and more epic. There's much more going on in this one. The action is common, but it's very well executed, with some great choreography, and graphically impressive brutality. The characters are more involved and more likable in this one. You feel the desperation of Oakenshield to reclaim his specie's glory as they get closer and closer to the mountain, and you get scared for Bilbo when he comes face to face with Smaug. The introduction to other characters such as Legalis, Thranduil, and a reference to Gimley is also done well. It makes you feel more related to the original films, and it's very enjoyable.One thing that bothered me is Bilbo. He didn't feel as much like a protagonist in this one. In the first one, it's his retelling of his experience throughout the story, getting the ring, adapting to the group and what not. In this one, he feels like a side character supporting the cause of Oakenshield or Tauriel and Kili's chemistry. He has his moments, don't get me wrong, but most of the time he just goes with whatever he's told to. He has no passion or journey of his own to complete, it's mostly about Oakenshield's vengeance.With that said...Smaug. Good gracious, when that dragon appeared in the film I about pooped. Not only is the CGI really sharp, but the voice of Smaug by Benedict Cumberpatch is phenomenal. Plus it's not too often a dragon in a film gets development.The film really ends out of nowhere. Like obviously it's to set itself up for the next film, but the last one had an official ending. This one just kind of stopped. I didn't dislike it, but it was kind of strange, it didn't seem to fit with the epic tones of the films before it that officially concluded each chapter, then this one just stops in plain sight. Either way, the film is an improvement over the first one. Like I said I enjoyed the first a good amount, but this one just had more of what I was looking for in the series. And with what i'm hearing about the 3rd film, that's gonna surpass this one, so i'm super excited!",8,1,3,1 January 2015
Twilight," Sparkling vampires = sucking on peckers
","Dracula is probably ticked off at this movie for making him look bad, because they did a heck of a job doing it. Bats everywhere probably want to take a huge bat crap on this piece of s**t film. Back in my day, vampires sucked blood, not people's peckers. Let me put it simple; most likely the WORST romance film, let alone the worst vampire film in the history of mankind. The only films that might be worse are its sequels. For fans of the books, this might be worth watching, but that means they really like vampires, or their gay. I'll admit the first book was all right. But the movies just sucked the big peckers.The film follows the novel in all the wrong ways. Adds completely unnecessary scenes, and doesn't make use of the plot as much as it could have. Plus its just so pathetic and silly it almost makes you wanna laugh. A girl found out that she's been hanging with a vampire, and she doesn't get scared or anything. COME ON! Who would be cool after realizing you were just with a freaking vampire! Thats so freaking dumb. Give me a break! Plus, did someone think the vampires weren't gay enough? Whose bright idea was it for them to sparkle? Vampires do not sparkle, no matter what you do to these!The actors overdo it, and put way too much work into pulling off their characters. When Edward leaves the classroom after first meeting Bella, he looks like he's gotta take a crap. The performances are just too shaggy. Their not calm at all.I could go on forever, but I think iv'e covered enough. In short terms, this movie blows the big wiener. Anybody else would agree with me. Only gays and lovers of vampires would love this, and thats their problem. Don't let it be mine.",Null,3,5,5 January 2011
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Doesn't hold a candle to the LOTR trilogy, but decent overall.
","First time I saw this I wasn't the biggest fan, mostly because of my bias towards the LOTR trilogy. Looking at it again, it still has its issues but it's by no means a bad film, it's a definite worthy beginning to this epic trilogy.The lovable, care free Bilbo Baggins, (Martin Freeman) is enlisted by Gandalf and a group of Dwarfs to go on an unexpected journey to Lonely Mountain to reclaim it from the evil dragon, Smaug.It has similar charm to the Fellowship of the Ring. Martin Freeman is an improvement over Ian Holm as Bilbo, bringing an all new sense that we haven't seen yet. The dwarfs are all fun and charming, but their introduction rather dwells on comedic relief, though as soon as they hum the Lonely Mountain song, it drowns you in its atmosphere. As the journey progresses, you learn more and more about each dwarf and their background, and you're lead by Bilbo the whole time, making you feel for him when he feels left out by the group for being not as brave or not cut out. The effects of the film are not as impressive as the ones in the LOTR, not that the CGI is much better, just that it's used more carefully.The film does drag on a tad. A lot of scenes painfully go on and on to try and add to the epic tone of the film, but trying to make the innocent little kids book into a major epic doesn't always work. A lot of memorable scenes in this, most notably the Gollum scene, but is covered by dragged scene after dragged scene.Overall it's the weakest film of either trilogy, but it still gets by with likable and familiar characters, and some decent action scenes. I would watch it to get through and watch the others, but it has some charm to it that makes it stand out overall.",6,1,1,13 February 2015
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Very tightly made film
","Definitely a noteworthy film in its technicals. From the costumes, to the actors, to the story, to the cinematography, everything is very well made. The ensemble cast is irresistibly combined with the tragically interesting story with a very humorous touch to it.An author (Tom Wilkinson) recounts his story of visiting a dying grand hotel, in which the owner, (F. Murphy Abraham) sits him down and tells his story of how he became in possession of it, as he recounts his service as a lobby boy and his association with M. Gustave, (Ralph Fiennes) the hotel's concierge.The film is fast paced and very clever with its dark humor and dramatic hooks. Despite who may or may not be a bad guy, everybody is likable in some sense, from their goofy antics to their unusual appearances, (Willem Dafoe).The film looks beautiful. Its colors are vibrant and the camera style is amazing. Not being one on makeup or costumes, the costumes are very creative in this, complimenting the art direction and style of the settings. Everybody in this is irresistible, even small roles that include Bill Murray and Tom Wilkinson. Ralph Fiennes carries this film with an incredibly underrated character with irresistible charm.It's paced to perfection. It's tightly edited but it's not too fast paced. Its got an unusual humor to it as well. It's not really a black comedy because of how bright it is, but its got subtle dark touches here and there that come out of nowhere, the film is constantly unpredictable, but very easy to follow.In terms of film making, it's somewhat of a masterpiece. Its not something that would impact society in any way, but it's a thrill ride to say the least. Highly recommended if you're looking for a quirky fun comedy with a dark edge.",8,2,4,16 January 2015
Foxcatcher," Steve Carell like you've never seen him.
","Seeing Steve Carell on the poster of this is what grabbed me at first. Plus Steve Carell in a drama role, you don't see that too often, so I was interested. I was completely amazed by his performance along with Mark Ruffalo and Channing Tatum. These 3 really go at it in this compelling drama.The story follows the true events of Gold Medal winning wrestler Mike Schultz (Channing Tatum), and his transition into the team Foxcatcher while dealing with pressure from his new glory destined coach, (Steve Carell) and back and forth relations with his brother, (Mark Ruffalo).Steven Carell is very impressive as a troubled, yet strong willed human. The makeup job on him completely immerses him in his character. Channing Tatum, who's last films were 21 and 22 Jump Street, is destined and determined. Mark Ruffalo was probably my favorite performance, he was the perfect support for Tatum in the right moments, and you always felt happy for him because he's always in a cheery mood.The film's story is told pretty straight forward. It doesn't take any risks or add drama every second that their is. It gives us the determination of each character, and they're the shining knights that push on the story's progression. The film just kind of ebbs and flows, and naturally the conflicts fall into place.I will say I wasn't heavily sympathetic toward the characters when you were supposed to, just because they didn't focus well enough on their emotions at times. Aside from that, this was a really well told recount of a true story, and is well recommended.",7,0,3,29 December 2014
28 Days Later...," Scary as hell!
","An intensified version of the George Romeo zombie films which brings a stronger introduction to new and more frightening zombies. One of the decades most popular horror films, and one of the most popular films of the year.We take a horrific look into Danny Boyle's vision of zombies roaming London, England 28 days after a evil raging virus outbreak. A survivor named Jim, (Cillian Murphy) as well as three other survivors fight to stay alive as they make their way to an army bunker post, seeking refuge.Zombies like they have never been done before. A lot more scarier than the Romero ones, these have a lot more creepy features, not to mention they run, and are a lot more threatening. Some might argue its just a simple zombie apocalypse movie, which it sort of is. But regardless, its pretty darn scary. Not just jump out scary, but psychologically as well.This is the film that created running zombies. 2 years later, the Dawn of the Dead remake will be using them. The first five minutes of the film I was already like, WTF. But by the end, I was pleased. Though I do have to say the rest of the film gets a little weird when they get picked up by the soldiers, turning to a completely different plot. But it still finds a way to keep the mood the whole movie.So yeah, its not as good as Dawn of the Dead, but its definitely a worthy horror film for all the fans out there. Check it out, and get ready for a heck of a scare.",7,0,1,27 December 2010
JFK," Not my thing
","Not big on hardcore political 3 hour films, like this or Nixon. Especially ones that lie in your face. I like Oliver Stone's style, I really liked Platoon, but this got boring quick, especially when I know all of what they say is bull crap. The music and editing tried to make it more interesting, but it didn't do much. Performances are decent, with Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Costner, and Joe Pesci.Story basically goes into the Jim Garrison investigation behind the assassination of John F. Kennedy, showing his interviews, deep readings, and attempts to serve justice. Looks into a lot of info flashback style, but I think they try to hard to inform us. Most of the dialogue is obvious facts going deeper into hardcore facts that most of us don't care about. I feel like i'm reading a book instead of watching a movie.One major problem is Stone's inconsistency with the truth. There was one shooter, not three. Stone changed it around just to make it more interesting. Also, some characters are falsely portrayed. Garrison in real life was rotten, corrupt, and unfair, while he's portrayed in the film as a fair and reasonable working man and loving father. Not Costner's fault really, just the script. I just couldn't get into it, they were shoving the history books into my brain. If you want a 3 hour false history lesson, then here ya go.",5,3,13,26 June 2010
Gone Girl," Very good, almost great.
","This is one of those films where I like it, but the more I think about it the more i'll probably end up loving it. It's probably my least favorite David Fincher film as of now, but it's still something special that got me thinking hard.Based on the novel by Gillian Flynn, the film tells about Nick Dunne, who's wife disappears on their fifth anniversary. A break in to their house makes it look like kidnapping, but as the investigation goes on and on, we get back story from the diary of the wife which brings us to different questions and focuses.Right away the film grabs me and pulls me into the film's story with the characters, which is what I love about David Fincher films. The film gets the plot going before we barely get acquainted with out characters, but ingeniously manages to cause us to start asking question within 5 minutes of the film.As usual the music by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is fantastically tense in each and every scene. That combined with a superb editing job by Kirk Baxter gives you a thrill ride putting you on the edge of your seat.Without spoiling anything, a reveal to the plot half way through kind of threw me off balance, it felt like something that should have happened later on. Nevertheless, it kept me enthralled with its story, as I was constantly asking questions. By the end of the film I was satisfied, describing it as sinister. I will say that the ending is sinister as hell in every way. Like I said it's a film that gets you thinking, which is why I feel like if I see this again, i'm going to love it.For right now, I do highly enjoy it. It doesn't have much suspense but it has huge amounts of tension and that gives you enough to get through it's possible over length. Well recommended.",7,0,3,28 December 2014
Insidious," Scariest film of all time!
","When it comes to a horror film for me, 10:00 p.m. in the basement, lights out, headphones on, volume cranked, full screen, and I say to myself, 'lets do this'. No, not really, but yeah. By the time I finished this film, I had some wetness in my pants, and was shaking like crazy. This film is insanely scary to no end. They may be mostly jump scares, but some psychological stuff is thrown in also, and the jump scares fuel them, making them 10x more scarier.The film's dark atmosphere and beautiful and scary music score fuels it into each scene preparing you for the worst, then hits you where you least expect it. BOOM! jump scare, a psychological one here and there. But yeah, not much else but jumpers. But that's still fine. There's nothing wrong with them. Now a days, psychologically scaring someone is almost impossible, so what other choice do director's have. But this one found a way to make it work. Quite a clever maneuver.Some don't like jumpers, and that's fine. But in this film, its an exception, no question. Because the jump scares don't just scare the ever living s**t out of you, but they make the more psychological scares scarier than usual. You'll know what I mean when you see it.Most modern day horror films don't fit the bill of scariness, such as Paranormal Activity. But films such as this, and Disturbia, it works like a charm. When I first heard of this, I thought it would just be another stupid horror film thinking it was scary, and just had pointless bull crap in it. But instead I got something different. I got a horror film and a director, actually trying, and succeeding.This film was simply nonstop scary, and in terms of horror films, that means its good. The scarier the better. And for this film, it couldn't be scarier, so it couldn't be better. Scariest film ever!",7,1,2,23 July 2011
The Theory of Everything," Solid performance covers up a few hiccups in the screenplay.
","This isn't a film full of in-depth scientific Christopher Nolan nonsense like some claimed it to be. It's a simple yet inspired biographical drama covering the life of Stephen Hawking and his wife Jane from Cambridge 1963, to the years of decay as Stephen's Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis slowly disables him.Eddie Redmayne carries this film. He is insanely believable as the real life scientist, and gives a really likable impression of his own in the performance. I feel like he really has the disease, because he goes out of his way to experience every level of difficulty that the real life scientist has to deal with.Felicity Jones as Jane is very supportive, likable, and heart wrenching. The rest of the supporting cast falls flat. They're not bad, but nothing really noteworthy. The cinematography is spot on, the lighting in particular.The film provides a subtle pace throughout, slowly covering all the difficulties with Stephen and his wife after their quick romantic development. In terms of the science, it displays and explains a lot, but it didn't have as much of a scientific edge as I thought it would. I thought a little more focus could have been put into what makes him a well known genius besides his disability. A lot of focus is between the relationship of him and his wife, which builds the tension in their marriage. I enjoyed it, but it could have balanced it out more in my opinion.The film's ending slightly annoyed me. They covered the Jane and Jonathan relationship well, but Stephen and Elaine's chemistry did not feel very strong, it felt very rushed, making the end of Jane and Stephen's marriage come out of nowhere.Overall, it retells the story of Stephen Hawking in an inspiring fashion. It's got its moments, but Eddie Redmayne truly carried this film with a groundbreaking performance. Truly a film to be remembered.",7,0,0,12 January 2015
The Mist," Lame
","Dumb adaption to late Stephen King novel about people trapped in a supermarket by a surrounding mist the night after a thunderstorm. Whats in the mist? Its a Stephen King novel, what do you think? Supernatural creatures with tentacles. How nice. Predictable build up is only followed by stupid characters, boring scenes, dumb action, and a stupid realistic view. Yeah, i'm sure this what people react to when they're scared. Very nonbelieveable, but thats just the beginning. Characters that I just wanted to punch in the face. They're so stupid. The premise itself doesn't help. Someone should tell the director that if you copy a book exactly in a movie, it doesn't always work as well.This film could not exist and it wouldn't change a thing, when in fact, it would actually help. Not to mention its very terrible ending that blows big d**k. Miserable fail.",4,1,4,2 September 2011
Gran Torino," Eastwood does it again!!!
","Eastwood's age doesn't stop him from making masterpieces, and he proves it by making this powerful drama, where he stars and directs, showing the world that he's still go it. One of the most emotional films I, or the whole world has ever seen. It just goes to show that age has nothing to do with pride.Former Korean fighter Walt Kowalski observes his new Korean neighbors during his wife's funeral, and automatically hates them. Walt's life could be described as gone, for he can't cope with the fact that he's worn out, and can't reach out to his two spoiled sons. He catches one of the Koreans who moved in next door try to steal his most prized possession, his 1972 Gran Torino. He realizes the kid, named Thao, (Bee Vang) was forced into it by his trouble making cousin, who's in a Korean gang. Despite several insults and arguments, Walt conjures up a relationship with him, as they bond together into a partnership.As usual, Eastwood gives a spectacular performance and gets extremely into his character, as well as the others. The music, also by him is not half bad. Despite Eastwood's lack of singing abilities, he still manages to get through it.A dark tone sets itself throughout the movie, turning to disturbing scenes of depression and hate. The final scene in the movie will bring you down to tears. As for everything else, just an all out brilliant masterpiece that is well expected of Eastwood.",10,2,6,23 May 2010
The Hurt Locker," Was this story made by a 15-year-old modern warfare 3 noob?!
","I don't even know if this one deserves to be reviewed. I laughed after I saw it, and I crapped my pants when it won best picture. I should just forget this film ever existed. But I really wanna point out the full extent of this film's stupidity, (as much as it may hurt).2004 Baghdad, U.S. Army bomb squad loses it's bomb disarmer, (Guy Pearce). Replacement Jeremy Renner is a loose cannon who plays by his own rules and disregards safety for either himself and his fellow sergeants, not to mention the rules of the U.S. Army. Recklessness causes emotional struggle when the sergeants open their eyes to the true life risking danger of war.Message: War is addicting. MAKES NOOOOOOO SENSE!!! You'd have to be dumb as a rock to come up with that. Apparently watching people die is more addicting than cocaine or weed, (for this guy anyway). What, this films trying to be realistic!?, (throws up). Realistic my ass! this guy'd be thrown out of the Army in a millisecond. Hell! Half the crap these guys pull would get them thrown out. A guy holds a knife up to the neck of his own comrade, and earlier contemplated killing him by blowing him up. One of them wounds the other in the leg, (I like the scene out of making me laugh), and goes out on his own for a personal issue. And man is it boring. Nearly fell asleep if it weren't for the booming surround sound. Most scenes consist of disarming a bomb, with pointlessly extended suspense thrown in, and hardly any action scenes.I think iv'e made my point. Overrated does not begin to say it. At first I thought, (did I see a different film?) but no, it was the one praised by critics, and won best picture. My jaw dropped to the ground. Can't say iv'e had this experience, since I enjoy most best picture winners, and if I don't, I don't really hate them. But wow. Just wow! Just goes to show women cannot direct war films. Only reason this was praised was most likely because the director is a woman. I guarantee that's why. All I can say to conclude this is, WOW!",1,3,6,23 May 2010
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Not as bad as the first, but still pretty flawed.
","Even though I like this one more than the first one, it still has it's flaws. Some big, some small, either way, it makes for one average film. Andrew Garfield returns as the web swinger, and if you liked his wise cracks and sarcasm in the first one, then you won't be disappointed here. He's actually better at making up wise cracks then actually taking his job more seriously than he is. Honestly, he plays a much better Spider-man in this one, not immediately jumping on someone's face, but instead trying to reason with them, which makes him seem more like a nice guy. Gwen Stacy returns as his love interest, which makes for the main focus of the film. It's so on and off in the film since Peter is guilty over the death of Gwen's father in the first and the promise he made to him to leave his daughter out of it. Even though that's kind of interesting, they still kind of replace it with ways to make it humorous in scenes. Their affection, while touching, is cut short by the 50 other plots going on, making you just want the film to take it slow.Jamie Foxx as Electro was an unique design, but an ugly effect. I thought his motivation was weak and the delivery was forced. Harry Osborn, aka the Goblin was also a sh*tty villain. The kid is a bad actor in general, and he brings the Goblin to shame. Oh, and Rhino? Well, once you see the film you'll know why he's not worth discussing.The main focus of the film, like I said, is the romance between Gwen and Peter. I honestly think it worked out for the most part, it was the only part of the film that didn't feel crammed or forced, it felt necessary. Even though some parts were sappy or silly, I still enjoyed their interactions.That's this film's best compliment is one particular scene, and the relationship, that's about it. The rest of the film feels cluttered and crammed with all these different things going on that felt forced, I'm just like 'can we please just see him fight somebody or interact with Gwen Stacy?' It's almost like Peter Parker is bipolar. One second he's obsessed over his parent's secret, then he's all cheery about Gwen Stacy in the next scene. Better than the first? Yes. Decent movie over all? No, was watchable but would still not recommend unless you're a comic book fan.",5,14,31,3 May 2014
Back to the Future Part III," Perfect ending to one of the greatest franchises.
","Terrific conclusion to Robert Zemeckis's epic trilogy. Tributes the other two, passing the second one, remaining strong and powerful to conclude the trilogy with an iron fist. We've seen them change the past to fix the future, and now they're on their way to the past to create the future.Marty learns of the Doc's survival after seeing the Dolorian get struck by lightning, as he resides in the Old Wild West of 1885. After learning that the Doc dies from a ruthless bounty hunter, he travels back to 1885 with the Dolorian buried in the ground by the 1885 Doc, traveling back to 1885 to regroup with the Doc, who has lived happily in the West, and falls in love with a beautiful piece of history.Although the love affection kind of gets in the way of the plot to get back and fix the future again, it kind of is part of that plot anyway. Its a lot more epic and intense in this one, not just surviving the West, but the doc starts to wonder whether he should stay with his admirer in the West, or return home, which creates a lot of tension. Returns jokes that were in the others, and still remain funny. It just feels great to get a relaxing of so much time traveling and just take a break, with some minor, but cool West experiences.Perfectly concludes the series, and leaves you with a happy ending with a positive feeling, of one of the most epic trilogies of all time.",7,0,0,6 June 2010
Lincoln," Spielberg's finest history film since Saving Private Ryan!
","That was not Daniel Day Lewis portraying Lincoln. That was the actual Lincoln. I am convinced that he went back in time and did this film, because that was Lincoln. These weren't performances in this film, these were the real life people who happen to look like actors, playing history. I have never seen history displayed more accurate in any other film.The story of Lincoln, you expect him growing up, becoming president, leading up to his assassination. Nope, this is the story of what made Lincoln a legend, as it displays the last few months of his life as he attempts to allow the 13th amendment to abolish slavery. That's the entire focus on the film. It's during the civil war, but that's not the war going on in the film. The war going on is in a room of politicians talking over it, that's the true war in this film, and it is display perfectly.Everybody grand slammed their roles. Tommy Lee Jones as Stephens, Sally Field as Lincoln's wife, even the two sons of Lincoln. History has been recreated by Spielberg with cameras, and we have the honor of reliving it.So much goes on in the film, leading up to the vote, and even though you know exactly what's going to happen, it still manages to grab you in desperation. I love history films, I loved how real they made it, and I always did. But compared to this, all of those others are children's books, this is the real deal.Daniel Day Lewis won an Oscar for his performance as Lincoln, (according to the papers). The truth is Lincoln won an Oscar for portraying himself. Daniel Day Lewis was born for this role, and nobody could have pulled it off better. This character will be remembered forever, as well as the performer. I am proud to call Daniel Day Lewis one of my favorite actors of all time. As for the directing, Spielberg never fails to amuse me, he always knows what is good to show in history. One thing I will say is, don't watch this movie if you don't understand politics, it is very heavy on politics. That being said, not all scenes are about politics, but most of it is. But trust me, if you need to take a government class to understand this film, then it's worth it.As much as I did like the film Argo, I was very disappointed that this didn't win best picture. This is ultimately the better film, very unsure what was going on. But I know what the better film is. No exception, probably the best and most accurate history film out there.",10,7,12,7 July 2013
Guardians of the Galaxy," The rompiest...and the best of the Marvel Universe films!
","This right here is endless entertainment. It's a Marvel comic film that doesn't take itself too seriously, and knows how to have fun. Creative sets, visuals, dialog, and characters is still cutting short how much is in this film. Some of the most epic proportions of any comic book film I've ever seen.Peter Quill, or Starlord, obtains an orb powerful enough to destroy the galaxy. With the hands of Ronan at its grasp, he unwittingly teams up with three other intergalactic criminals to keep it from falling under Ronan's hands.Right away what I like about this film is it knows how to have fun. It's by far the rompiest of any Marvel universe films. It knows when to address emotion and drama, but never takes itself too seriously. Characters are likable to the extreme, even some that get off at a bad start. Chris Pratt as Peter is irresistibly charming, and Zoe Saldana as Gamora is very motivated and determined. I could not recognized Bradley Cooper's voice as Rocket when I first saw this. Never the less, he is by far one of the most entertaining things of this film. Groot is Groot, and Dave Bautista as Drax is hilarious! They all have different sides of themselves that we all see. They all have their own moments and you instantly feel for them and are on their side until the end.The action is beautiful. The cinematography is slick, fast paced, and it's just great to look at. The overall universe is so amazing, and it reminds me so much of Destiny.The villain, Ronan, is not the greatest villain, mostly because his on screen usually consists of nagging and being badgered. With that said, he has his moments as well, and Thanos, well, until the sequel, there's not too much there.The soundtrack...goodness gracious this has a fantastic soundtrack. The songs are fun, cute, perfect for the type of film, and they fall into place in all the right parts of the film. The soundtrack is one of my favorite of several other things about this film. Literally love this soundtrack to no end. Its presence in the film just gives all the right moments the perfect amount of essence.I could go on, but that'd take all day. In conclusion, this is a must see, not just for Marvel or comic book fans, but anybody who enjoys fun. It's simply a fun film made for all audiences. It speaks to the soul and has something for every type of person out there. Whether it be action, visuals, dialog, or characters, there's basically nothing to not enjoy about this. Highly recommend.",8,1,3,1 March 2015
The Imitation Game," A compelling drama that motivates its message beautifully.
","This is one of the best WWII dramas I've ever seen. It doesn't focus on the fighting or the politics, but the story of Alan Turing, and the building of the Enigma machine to decipher German coding, which successfully saves millions from the war, while Alan was prosecuted for being a homosexual. Truly inspiring film that speaks for the different and the determined.Benedict Cumberpatch is absolutely perfect for this role. He plays is perfectly as an awkward fellow who's different personality doesn't stop him from achieving greatness. He acts it so well so we always feel what he's feeling, and the phenomenal writing makes him even more likable. Keira Knightly is charming, supportive, and sympathetic toward Alan's different personality, and becomes his only glimmer of light in his life. The film does a good job on staying focused, not touching too much on homosexual themes, except when necessary. It's so well written, every line of dialog sounds poetic. From the science behind the enigma to the thought process of the human brain, this film has got its facts down.The music is also to be addressed. Very well composed score that intensifies each scene, and never overstays its welcome. By the end, the message is clear without hammering it in, and it's very informal. I love films that teach you something about history, and this film told its story so well. Benedict Cumberpatch is officially on my actor appreciation list, as well as this film. One of the best films of 2014.",8,1,4,5 March 2015
Black Hawk Down," A little overlong, but still enjoyable.
","Definitely one of the best war dramas of all time. Filled with tons of action and gore that will have war film fans cringing. The first time I saw this was cut up on FX. But after seeing it a second time, not to mention a better time, I found it to be an absolutely brilliant film. After all the other great war films made, its hard to compete. But Ridley Scott does it the right way.Based on the actual event of 1992 in Somalia, American soldiers are sent to clean up the African mess in the city involving the starvation of villagers, which turns out to be a blood bath when the mission becomes more complicated than expected, leaving them to fight for their lives.Perfectly edited, great cinematography, excellent performances, and full blown action. The only problem this film bears is over length. Some of the action scenes could've been chopped, as well as some of the scenes from the beginning, as I started to get impatient. But its not too long before things start to pickup in the end. Stars Orlando Bloom, Josh Harnett, William Fichtner, and Tom Sizemore. Although quite a bit more gore than a usual war film, Ridley Scott, with Alien and Gladiator, apparently likes gross realism in his films, which is actually kind of entertaining.A war film that debates over your opinion. But for me, it was a clean, organized, and excellent war film.",8,1,2,25 August 2010
The Dark Knight," Masterpiece
","Not only is this the best Batman film, or the best comic book film, but it's one of the best films ever made period. Its performances skyrocket, along with its incredibly dark tone, it's beautiful settings and lighting, and of course...BATMAN.I don't care what anybody says. Christian Bale is a good Batman. Yeah, he's not as good as Michael Keaton, and yeah his voice can get a little annoying. But he is such a badass in these movies. Nothing scares him, he's tough and aggressive as crap, and you just want to stay out of his way. Michael Keaton is very badass, don't get me wrong, but Christian Bale is just somebody you simply don't want to mess with.And Heath Ledger as the Joker...Where do I begin. Jack Nicholson was an amazing Joker. Seriously, his joker was so convincing. I thought nothing could top it. And when I heard the gay cowboy who made out with Jake Gyllenhal was going to be the Joker, I was so disturbed. I prepared for the worst when I saw it. But I was 100% incorrect on my analysis. Heath Ledger nailed the performance harder than he nailed Jake Gyllenhal. He's unbelievably convincing. He's funny, he's crazy, but most of all, he's scary as s***. I crapped my pants in the theatres. It was no question he topped Nicholson. I love Nicholson's joker, but Heath Ledger just took the cake.The setting of the film is so dark, which was what Christopher Nolan was going for apparently. I know Batman Begins was dark too, but this one is a lot more intense. I mean, it's called the 'Dark' Knight. The setting is dark, the plot is dark, the characters are dark. Darkness everywhere! Michael Caine as Alfred and Morgan Freeman as Lucias Fox support Christian Bale Batman so brilliantly, and all the way through. Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes is replaced with Maggie Gyllenhal, who I kind of like better in the role. Aaron Eckhart plays a very decent Harvey Dent as well.So excited to see the Dark Knight Rises. Midnight showing is tonight and i'm stoked to go see it with everybody else who's been waiting for the ending. I can't imagine anybody who hasn't seen this. The biggest blockbuster of the decade in my opinion. But hey, if you haven't, go see it now. I'd see Batman Begins first to stay focused. But this is where it's at.",10,1,5,14 July 2010
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Not as good as Goblet, but still mostly enjoyable.
","Goblet I thought really took a step forward. This film sort of did, it has promise, but overall it feels like filler to build up for the later films. The first half is about a government conspiracy to shut up Harry who's talking about Voldemort returning, then it jumps to the second half about training for the battle against Voldemort like the second half of Rocky. I liked the whole idea of the government not wanting to start a panic, so they're denying the inevitable, but after it goes to training it's just training scene after training scene, the only thing we're missing is a montage.It's nice to see familiar faces in this one, like Sirius Black and Molly and Arthur Weasley, seeing Harry interact with them is just nice to watch, like he has such good friends and family by his side. We get a couple new faces, most notably is Doris Umbridge, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher who is also a worker for the minister of magic. She's a promising villain who you just love to hate.Overall, it works for the most part, if they tried to do more to make it standout then it could really work, but it's just trying to build up for the later films basically. Even though it does it well, because you become pretty invested in the cause, it needs a little bit more to keep us interested in its 2 hour 20 minute length.",6,0,1,2 April 2015
Toy Story," 4th best film of all time!
","This is the first movie I ever saw. I grew up with this film and loved ever since I was little. A few movies surpass it, but every other film iv'e ever seen is inferior. This is one of the big ones. It takes a lot to live up to this film. Its one of the most popular films, if not the most popular film of all time!Tom Hanks and Tim Allen head the lead voice cast. A cowboy doll named Woody, whose been the favorite of his owner, Andy since he first got him, is in for it when he's replaced by the latest and hottest new toy, Buzz Lightyear, (Tim Allen). A few accidents here and there get them stranded in the middle of nowhere, causing them to team up to get back home.If the story isn't enough to pull you in, (which it should be anyway) then the beautiful animation, the brilliant voices, and the funny jokes will be more than enough. Of course, iv'e seen the movie so many times, I know about each scene and each fact of the movie by heart. Even after all these times watching it, I still manage to laugh at it a little.Everybody whose anybody has seen, or at least heard of this film. I don't know a single person who hasn't seen this. All I can say left is that its one of the greatest and touching films of all time. Except for a few other films, nothing passes this film!",10,0,0,6 January 2011

","In this France thriller, Liam Neeson plays a retired CIA agent who's daughter gets kidnapped into prostitution in Paris, causing him to take action and locate his daughter by any means, (and that means killing anybody who steps in his path).He trained Batman, changed the lives of 2000 Jews, and fought off a pack of wolves, now he's back and more bad-ass than ever. Despite his old age, he still manages to impress us to no end.I like to compare this film to Bourne, except while Bourne is always on the defensive, Neeson in this is on the full on offense. No mercy in this film, everybody who doesn't help him locate his daughter gets it, no joke. It's extremely fast paced and doesn't fool around. Gets right down to business. No rush either, just simply fast filmed. Fast editing, fast dialog, and fast and awesome action scenes. Most of the film consists of Liam Neeson killing, interrogating, or chasing someone. The villains change from person to person, as he simply follows around his daughter's kidnappers.Although a truly simple story, it still stays bright with the smartness of the character, and his amazing skills. But regardless, it isn't very complex, like Bourne is. But it really didn't need to. Why be needlessly complex just to waste pointless time and money. It's as simple as it gets. Plus a few parts are really intense, making it feel complex.If I had to argue one thing, it'd be that it was a little anti- climactic. Kills everybody and rescues the daughter, that's it. Yes, he does get captured, but escapes immediately. Then the daughter returns and is like, 'bye dad, thanks for saving my life', (Not what she really says, but basically). Even though that didn't bother me too much, it was just something I noticed. Other than that, simply brilliant. No complicated subplots or characters, doesn't ever drag, just the plot, the character, and his mission, that's all. You will not find another film that does that, I assure you. Definitely worth the watch! Just be careful with the sequel, I heard it isn't as good.",8,0,0,10 December 2012
Avatar," Hyped up, but still pretty
","I did not enjoy this as much as I did a while ago in the theaters. I rewatched it recently, and I realized that most of my enjoyment the first time was the hype it was receiving as one of the most grossing films of the year and decade, not to mention it's a 17 year project. If you think about it in the Duke Nukem Forever sense, that its been built up all this time so we should expect more and be disappointed, then you'll most likely be disappointed. It's the standard Dances with Wolves/Pocahontas setup with blue cats in the mix. If you have zero expectations, then you'll enjoy it more. Me, I was expecting better for sure, but it gets buy, sorta.The protagonist is John Smith...no, Jake Sully, my bad. Either way, he's going to try and help the blue cats on their planet called Pandora. He forms his own Avatar of a blue cat and becomes a member of their tribe, learning their ways and wits, while also getting it on with Pocahontas, (clears throat) Neytiri.The characters are all clichés, the military bad guy who wants harvest as much as possible from nature, but oh no we the people say you have no right to deprive them of their home. The story is so formulaic. It has little surprises here and there, but I predicted the whole thing.The film is still enjoying to watch regardless, for a different reason. To me, the enjoyment doesn't come from the writing, characters, or story, cause that'll get you nowhere. The enjoyment comes from the technicals of the film. The cinematography, visuals, scenery, and action are all FANTASTIC!! I was blown away by how good this movie looks. The colors, the clearness, everything about it is just stunning, especially in blu ray. I must sound like a Michael Bay fan saying the visuals are better than the story, but honestly, that's all I was enjoying about it.If you're expecting a phenomenon to change filmmaking forever, you won't find it here, it's a sloppy story with sloppy writing and clichéd characters. But man oh man it looks stunning, probably one of the best looking movies I've ever seen. It's entertaining for the most part, so if that's enough for you, then I recommend it.",7,2,8,5 June 2010
Selma," A little too in your face for me.
","I was pretty interested in seeing this, mostly because this was the main contender for Oscar bait, (before the Oscar nominations anyway). I saw it opening day with my brothers, needless to say it wasn't packed, (probably too busy seeing Transformers or something stupid). The film wasn't as much of an impact as I hoped it would be. I was hoping it would grab me in the same way 12 Years a Slave did, but it wasn't nearly as moving as I thought.It tells the story of MLK Jr. (David Oyelowo), as he fights to get voting rights from Alabama's African American restrictions through his pacifist ways and reasoning, assembling a march from Selma to Montgomery.The cinematography, performances, and directing style are excellent. The cinematography was smooth, stylish, and it just looked good overall with the lighting. David Oyelowo was super convincing. He not only looked the part, but he acted the crap out of the part. His wife played by Carmen Ejogo is very supportive, and was probably my second favorite performance of the film. Other than her, the rest of the supporting cast is kind of weak. Opera plays the exact same character in every single film about race, the strong willed woman who doesn't tolerate discrimination by hitting people, it's a reprise of her role in The Color Purple, which was done better. Tim Roth as George Wallace is so over the top, it's just goofy. Martin Sheen is barely in it, so I don't see the point of him in the film other than just being a cameo. I didn't appreciate their portrayal of LBJ as Tom Wilkinson. Though his performance was good, they payed no respect to the man who reasoned with MLK in real life and was the one who suggested the march in the first place. It makes me feel like the director is testing the Academy on race.I didn't feel like the film spoke to me. 12 Years a Slave was my favorite film of last year, that film spoke to me and it told its story more interestingly. In here, it feels like they're just hammering in the white guilt in every scene. I know that's how it really was, but i'm sorry, its just been done to death, we don't need another one. There's preachy scenes that are well done, but it just keeps going back to constant scenes of race violence. 12 Years a Slave had that as well, but it had a stronger narrative for me, about how it's all about survival. In here, they just milk it way too much, especially with LBJ's portrayal. Again, it's not Tom Wilkinson's fault, he acts it well, it's the way he was written. I enjoyed the technical aspects of the film, the performances and editing and what not, but it lacked a solid narrative, and it tried too hard to appeal to the 'don't be racist' film lovers. I'm not against those films, but it's overdone here. Still would recommend, but just not for me.",6,9,17,9 January 2015
The Artist," Not really bad, but against it for best picture.
","Usually, I hate these kinds of movies. The kind that people make, knowing the academy and the critics will go crazy over them. This movie was made because the director knows that the academy jerks off to these types of movies. The academy is so predictable. However, I took a look at this because it is nominated for best picture, and it actually, surprisingly was not as bad as I thought. Though not really my type, it was enjoyable enough.Has a pretty decent story I guess. In the 1920s, silent movie actor George Valentin becomes a dying star when sound comes into cinema, upsetting him and his career. Meanwhile, young mistress Peppy Miller becomes the top star of the generation.The movie operates like a 1920s film, by using title cards to display what people say throughout. Gets kind of annoying, but some are into that, (espcially the academy and critics) but whatever. Very good acting performances. Since most of the movie is silent, the actors have to act out really spontaneously so the audience can tell what they're feeling, which works really well. Sound is implied on important occasions, some good, some really weird.So you might be thinking, 'what are my reasons for not liking this as much after all this good talk about it?'I do not want this movie to win best picture,just gonna come out and say it. Not because I don't like it as much, or because it's not my type, but because it's so obvious that it's gonna win. The academy eats out these types of movies that represent old cinema. The director probably purposely made this film because he knew the academy. The academy doesn't care what the better movie is. All they need is a typical mello drama, like the King's Speech. Social Network was 10x better than the King's Speech...too bad Social Network isn't a mello drama. Why did Hurt Locker win and not the better movie, Avatar? Because The Hurt Locker was directed by a girl. So obvious. The academy could not be more predictable. The Artist has best picture written all over it, but for the wrong reasons. It's like there's no purpose for it to exist except to win best picture. The academy needs to be less predictable, for real. The minute I saw the Artist, I said, 'best picture winner' and same for The King's Speech.The movie itself is not that bad, though I still hope it doesn't win best picture. It plays out well, and it has great performances, but it's just not my type, and it's just so obviously fit to be best picture. :/ Performances: 9/10 Screenplay: 7/10 Music: 7/10 Overall: 7/10",7,1,7,5 February 2012
Saw," Epic thriller!
","Very clever plot combined with insane characters creates this brilliantly made thriller by James Wan. Beginning one of the longest running horror genres ever, this film truly brought out the horror genre of the 21st century. It brings us a new era of scare that I've never seen before.Two men, (Cary Elwes, Leigh Whannell) wake up in a bathroom, chained by the ankle to pipes on opposite sides, and have no idea how they got there. After finding some clues left by their kidnapper, they discover they've been kidnapped by the Jigsaw killer, a psychopath who doesn't kill, but puts people in booby traps, forcing them to kill themselves. Flashbacks indicate the entire investigation, in which one of them was a suspect, leading all the way to the present.Filmed in a very creative and clever way, dealing with the crazy and insane mind of film making, using fast forward crazy camera zooms and techniques to make every scene intense as ever. Every scene puts you on edge.Scary not in a visual way or jumpy way, but a psychological way, dealing with scary ideas that will keep on your mind for a long time. Deals with a different scare that other movies could never carry on, (besides the others).Can get a little cheesy at times, like some of the acting performances by Leigh Whannell, who may not have been taking this seriously. Some actors act a little goofy, but only when things are calm. As soon as things heat up, no more playing around.All together, a beautifully filmed thrill ride that will have you on the edge of your seat until the end. Hard to not enjoy if you're into being scared the crap out of. Definitely one of the scariest of the decade. Followed by Saw II, and a bunch of other pointless sequels.",8,0,1,25 September 2012
Up," The most emotional Pixar film ever!!!
","Not only is this the second greatest Pixar film aside from Toy Story, but its the most emotional. I was in tears on so many scenes that I had so much crust in my eye the next day. The music score is irresistible, the animation is unbelievably smooth, and the characters are hilarious. The plot itself is also quite clever. Carl Fredrickson is a 78-year-old man who sets out on a quest with an annoying little boy scout named Russell to Paradise Falls in South America, the place of he and his deceased wife's dreams, until they encounter a giant but extremely rare animal hunted down by a famous hunter, which causes problems. Although plot may seem to be falling at times, it kicks itself right back up, with clever scenes, following the ridiculous occurrences. It all fits well as can be. Similar to other Pixars, with more emotionality. Absolutely fantastic! The perfect film for kids and adults.",8,1,2,8 June 2010
A Clockwork Orange," Disturbing masterpiece!
","Kubrick films have always had a special thing to them that I have always loved. They all work in a specific way: Specific camera angles, specific music for each situation in the film, and specific stories to each scene. Every soul disturbing and spine chilling scene in this has its own story which puts me on edge to no end. From the unusual use of wide angle lenses, to the awkward camera angles, combined with the eerie music to set the mood makes for one great thrill ride.Based on the novel by Anthony Burgess, Kubrick decided to bring the infamous Alex character to life in this evil version of Anthony's classic, bringing the characters, tone, and language to his own sick and twisted world.Our main character named Alex, (Malcolm McDowell) and his three 'droogs' all set out to spread chaos and mayhem around the world, breaking and entering, raping, beating, anything they can think of to make the world a worse place to live. Alex gets betrayed by his 'droogs and is sentenced 14 to life. He gets off the hook by participating in a new scientific experiment yet to be perfected, (change the cold blooded and deranged mind of a criminal into a peace loving citizen).Kubrick excellently displays Anthony's attempt on the language barrier between Alex and the viewer. The language, the setting, the camera angles, and every other piece of scenery perfectly places us into this characters world. The scenes of violence in Alex's mind puts us in his shoes and shows us how messed up he is. We see unexplained images that confuse us, but also intrigue us, as we transport ourselves into his mind. Kubrick does not show mercy with the nudity. Every corner there is a pair of boobs in your face. This is not his simple intention to arouse the audience or to be explicit, but simply to show us that Alex lives in a world without rules, regret, or discipline, and how it immediately all changes when he gets caught and participates in the experiment, and how it affects his world later.Kubrick truly is the only one who could have pulled off Anthony's vision. His absolute monstrous style of film making combined with the sick and twisted mind of Anthony Burgess easily makes this one of the darkest films of all time. I enjoyed every second of this classic story. The dark tone, the beautiful dialog and narration, and the excellent story telling makes this an easily enjoyed masterpiece.",8,1,3,29 December 2012
Groundhog Day," Best Bill Murray performance and one of the best comedies of all time.
","Bill Murray is usually irresistibly charming even if he's playing a huge douche. Nowhere is that more perfect than in here. He's so likable but so unlikable and charming, it's unreal. At his absolute best in this unusual romantic comedy of self change.Phil Conners, (Bill Murray) is a grumpy weather man who travels to Punxsutawney, PA for the annual Groundhog Day, only to be stuck in a time loop, reliving groundhog day over and over again. With nothing to lose, he has as much fun with it as possible, until his attraction to his journalist, (Andie Macdowell) makes him look at his life when he falls in love with her, not being able to change himself for her.It's a different take of romantic comedy where the romance is one sided. It deals with Bill Murray coping with the situation in different ways. He tries suicide, having fun, trying to do good to the point where he's tired of acting good then becoming rotten again. It's such a well set up film with a really fun touch to it. It cleverly plays around with the repetitive nature of the scenes. It can drive some nuts, but seeing him react in different ways every day is super fun.There have been so many philosophies about the time loop in this film: How long does he stay in the loop? what is the perspective of everybody else? What causes it? So many questions near the end, but it's such a clever way to display its message about self change.With that said, Bill Murray is hilarious. He is so care free and sarcastic in this film, it's unreal. He'll go with anything if it feels right. He manipulates women by learning a lot about them overtime, then sleeping with them. It's a film that can go anywhere at anytime. Watching Bill Murray's multiple reactions is just insanely hilarious. Nobody else could have pulled this off. It's simply perfect.Even though It's probably not the best comedy of all time, it's my favorite comedy. It's the perfect blend of stupid, clever, and emotional, and to be centered around one of the funniest people of all time, there's no getting around how excellent and timeless this is.",8,0,1,15 February 2015
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," Extremely ugly film
","Despite my rating, this is actually a well made film. It has high production values, decent acting, stunning sets, and great sound. In the technical aspects it is well directed. Regardless, it was one of the most tormenting films I've ever seen. It was such a struggle to get through. I was checking how much longer I had left like seventeen times a minute, because I just couldn't take it.This is a film that's told smart, executed well, but the portrayal itself is horrible. Long story short, fascism is wrong, end of story. But like the Purge, it's not enough to just say it, we gotta go through a whole mess of stuff to show you why it is. Basically fascists sexually torture nine boys and nine girls for four months in a mansion. And we're talking urinating in mouths, eating poop, three way intercourse, ejaculating on each other etc. The whole film is literally just scene after scene of that. It's nonstop. All of that, as we constantly are forced to endure stories about people going through the same stuff, but enjoying it. This film loves to emphasize each character's feelings on each scene. When they eat poop, the film describes in detail everybody's experiences with eating poop, and why they are fine with it. In a strange sense, it's well told and has some interesting insight, but that does not make it any easier to watch.Honestly though, the film as a whole is kind of boring. It really is just a matter of how shocking can we be. When it's not being depraved, it's just people in a room telling stories. There's really not much else to it.The problem with the film is that since it's on its own sick mindset, we as an audience aren't really on the same page, so we're just seeing random acts of violence, and not really anything else. There's no clear picture or goal the film projects, just that. David Lynch films do the same thing, but at least he gives us enough symbolism to let us know what to extract from the film. This one is just showing us that these people get off on this stuff, and that's it.One thing I found interesting was how the perspective is of the fascists themselves instead of the victims. Instead of being a standard psychological thriller about escaping, it's simply just these fascist's sick perversions and their opinions on it. They're the main characters, and they're the ones we follow. I thought that was rather interesting.At the end of the day, this is not one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but it's one of the hardest films I've ever had to sit through. It's pretty easy to hate this film. I don't hate it, but I would never want to watch this again, or would never recommend it to anybody ever. It's a well told film with an interesting insight, but it's way too hard to sit through and it's a one note theme that they just milk for an hour and 56 minutes.",4,0,5,21 April 2017
Rocky," A Masterpiece! One of the best.
","Considered one of the greatest movies of all time, it still lives up to itself today. Beginning from a masterpiece best picture winner to a popular 70's and 80's franchise, this film goes to no boundaries of greatness. It, along with its followers, are all brilliant. Definitely one of the best franchises ever!The story centers on south paw boxer tough guy Rocky Balboa,(Sylvester Stallone) who although gets paid doing boxing matches here and there, along with collecting money for a collector, can't make anything out of his career, or his life. Then, he finally gets his chance at turning his life around when he is challenged by Heavy Weight Champion Apollo Creed, who gives him the one shot at the biggest title in history. Rocky then prepares himself for the fight of his life, with his trainer Mickey, (Burgess Meredith), and his girlfriend, Adrian, (Talia Shire).The movie outdoes itself in almost every area. Its editing, directing, casting/acting, and just everything else in general. It gives itself an emotional feel, letting you feel comfortable with the movie, and feeling for the characters. Half the movie shows what Rocky's life is like everyday, showing his everyday activities. Then, the other half consists of being challenged, and getting prepared.The characters are some of best, classic characters of all time. Stallone gives an amazing Oscar nominated performance, along with a top billing cast. Talia Shire, as Adrian, gives a great performance as Rocky's incredibly shy, but very supporting girlfriend. Burt Young as Paulie, (Adrian's sister) plays a very bitter character as a abusively angered brother who always likes to yell. Burgess Meredith, as Rocky's bitter and broken down mentor, Mickey, is one of the most classic and greatest performances of all time. Mickey is an icon of movies, and he just completes the drama in the Rocky movies.The build up to the fight is also amazing, for you are rooting for Rocky all the way, and seeing him tense and nervous, just makes you wanna see him go all the way. Although the opponent, Apollo Creed, (Carl Weathers) isn't considered a bad guy, you still wanna see Rocky beat him down.The film is the absolute classic underdog film that is brilliant to no end. It is and will always be considered one of the best films ever made, especially in my book. Its epic, its amazing, and it will have you on your feet to the very end.",10,1,2,29 June 2011
Eyes Wide Shut," What a way for Kubrick to go out.
","Knowing Kubrick's style of movies, the explicit content in his movies, and the creepy style he does his movies in, I knew this last Kubrick project would be quite a thrill. Dying right after the movie was made, of a heart attack, I had a feeling Kubrick knew the end was near, and decided to go all out before he went out. And what a way to do it. This movie has Kubrick written all over it. This movie intrigued me quite a bit. Although it may seem like a usual Kubrick style movie, it quickly turns into a nonstop series of nude everywhere, and creepiness all around.New York doctor Bill Hartford, (Tom Cruise) has an argument with his wife, (Nichole Kidman) about being faithful with each other one night when they're both stoned after returning from a party. This leads her to reveal at one point in their marriage when she had a sexual fantasy with a man they met on vacation with their daughter, and was ready to give up her future with her husband and daughter just to sleep with him. This causes him to go out in the streets of New York, filled with jealousy and sexual flames, on a nonstop discovery of moral and sexual intercourse.He encounters a hooker, an awkward intrusion of a costume owner's daughter fooling around with two Asians, and a mansion where a ritual of sexual orgies is taking place. All fitting in one night, and continues on the next day, consuming you with tons of confusion, and questions you're just dying to know. By the time most of the more screwed up scenes are finished, they will leave you speechless and filled with curiosity. The hardest part of this film is not knowing whats going on, which can get a little on your nerves.Though it is a little slow, most Kubrick films are. Its not too bad, and it does build up pretty well. The music score by Jocelyn Pook is outstanding. That suspenseful piano piece that shows whenever somethings going on just gets shivers right down your spine.I couldn't believe the amount of nudity in this film. Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange, (1971) which is rated X, doesn't even have as much nudity as this, which I didn't think was possible, which is shocking considering Kubrick could have had it much worse, though he decided to block most of the sex shown, for rating issues, though the film is still rated NC-17.A truly terrifying thriller which is one of Kubrick's most shocking, yet highly intelligent drama thrillers, which will have you on the edge of your seat. Although not as good as A Clockwork Orange, its still one of the most thrilling films ever, and will live on in the legend of Stanley Kubrick forever.",7,0,0,22 July 2011
Titanic," An epic masterpiece!
","This is considered one of the best made films of all time. James Cameron outdoes himself big time, but this won't be the last epic he ever makes. The story of the Titanic like you've never seen it before. Epicness beyond anything reachable.The story is told in a flashback perspective, with Rose Dawson, a survivor of the Titanic, telling it to a group of scientists, and her granddaughter, telling about her experience on the Titanic, leading up to the fateful night where it would meet its historical doom. It also circles around her life changing star cross love affair with Jack Dawson, (Leonardo DiCaprio) another person on the Titanic.Begins with one of the greatest music scores of all time by James Horner, and then slowly takes us back to the very beginning. Goes incredibly smooth with the camera movement, making each and every individual scene epic as ever. The performances are beautiful as ever, with Billy Zane, Kate Winslet, Gloria Stuart, and Leo DiCaprio leading a brilliant cast.The first half is getting everything acquainted on the ship, and introducing all the characters, and setting the plot. The second half consists entirely of the boat sinking, which is very graphic. The visual effects are mind-blowing, with excellent and detailed parts of the ship. The music, editing, and setting really capture every single feeling and thought raced through the actual minds of the real people.One of three movies in history to win 11 Oscars. The others being Ben- Hur, and Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. I had to watch the movie five more times until I finally managed to without crying. Its a real tear fest. Almost everybody in this film is crying. Its depressing as ever, but in a good way. It brilliantly captures the terror of the people. Its hard for a film to do that. James Cameron wasn't screwing around when he made this. Everything in this movie is excellent. Nothing is in fault, absolutely nothing. Everything is 100% accurate!This film killed at the box office, which it well should have. Its a film that will go down in history. A film that nobody will ever forget, and will always cherish every little moment this film brings.",9,2,3,7 January 2011
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Brilliant!
","Chris Columbus creates this fantasy filled adaptation of the famous J.K. Rowling novel, with excellent visuals, great casting, and the most epic moments you've ever seen. Without a doubt one of the most popular movies of 2001, and is the beginning of one of the most popular series of the decade.11-year-old Harry Potter, whose lived his life with his dreadful step parents, the Dursleys, gets a visit from a giant man named Hagrid, (Robbie Coltrane) and realizes that he and his ancestors, as well as his dead parents, are wizards. He is then accepted at Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he finds himself a better life.Brilliantly honors the book, as well as adding its own material. The cast is also well known, with Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore, the headmaster of Hogwarts, and Maggie Smith as the deputy headmistress. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson play the leading roles as the three most famous teen actresses of the decade. Rupert Grint plays Ron Weasley, who becomes Harry's best friend, and Emma Watson playing the clever and smart Hermione Granger who is Harry's other best friend.Fans of the books will especially love this, but will also attract the attention of others. All the actors excellently portray their characters in the book, by both looks, and personality. A lot of phrases in the book are cited in the movie, showing the movie to be a true book adaptation.The editing jumps from both happy and normal moments, straight into suspenseful and horrific moments in the blink of an eye. The suspension cleverly introduces itself into the subplots. The cinematography is smooth, steady, and isn't dirty or shaky at all, yet still gives off excitement. The music score by John Williams is, as usual, brilliant. Definitely one of his better music scores. The visuals are excellent as well, even though their just simple CGI. But still look pretty impressive.Although runs a little long, just about every bit thats in their is necessary. Adds in the necessary things from the book, without including too much non-needed footage. Also includes an extended version that runs a few extra minutes.One of the most creative films iv'e ever seen, and the best Columbus film. With clever and patient filming, stunning visuals, and adapts to the book greatly, it holds out as one of the best films ever, and will soon be a popular series.",8,0,1,30 November 2010
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Finally showing some balls in the Harry Potter franchise.
","The series is finally willing to take risks in the Harry Potter franchise. Being the first PG-13 film, I was ready to see what it was going for. With dark storytelling and crazy psychotic characters, this one definitely took a step forward in the series. As the wizards of the Triwizard tournament are being chosen, Harry's name rises as one, forcing him to compete in three life or death situations to prove himself while trying to figure out who wants him dead.The story is a bit more interesting because the events don't just center around Harry, Hermione, and Ron's mischief. It's an event that involves everybody in Hogwarts. We get a decent amount of backstory, but manage to stay focused on the events in the present as well. It builds up the suspicion quite well with flashbacks, dream sequences and so on.All the characters have an enjoyable moment at some point. Ron and Hermione are much more supportive in this one, and their relationship even gets some decent development. Even Malfoy is pretty entertaining. Then there are characters that are just ridiculously out of the blue psychotic: Mad Eye Moody, Kakaroff, Barty Crouch Jr, and even Dumbledore has some insane moments.The film is definitely trying to go deeper, and it does quite well. As the books got more intense, the movies do a good job of following along. Not saying Prisoner of Azkaban wasn't pretty thrilling, but not on this level. It's just got a dark and edgy vibe that most films did in that era. Though it followed it up well with creepy imagery and intense scenes.",7,0,2,2 April 2015
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Great sequel!
","Daniel Radcliffe stars once again as the Boy who Lived in this exciting and magical sequel to Chris Columbus's excellent fantasy based off the novels by J.K. Rowling. Still has plenty of great visuals and exciting scenes, and continues the wonderful music score by John Williams. Although doesn't have has much of a strong feeling as the first, it still holds out as a worthy sequel.After an incident with a house elf in his bedroom, causing Harry to get into trouble by his step parents, Harry escapes with Ron and his brothers in their flying car. He then lands into more trouble when the gateway to the Hogwarts express is blocked off, forcing them to take the flying car. As Harry continues his life in Hogwarts, attacks of people start happening, leading them to suspect that a hidden chamber in the castle may be the cause of it.Filled with different subplots, but after awhile, they'll conjoin into one. The casting is still great, with all the same actors still portraying their characters well. Once again, brilliantly covers the main topics of the book, and still manages to get its own material. The thing that made the first better is how clever the story begins. Regardless, this one greatly continues the series, with references to the first, as well as finding ways for things from last year to change.Also becomes a little more modern, and less fashionable with everything. Suspense is very clever, with one thing to another, leading you to curiosity beyond everything. It becomes well explained about everything. Once again, you will enjoy it even if you haven't read the book, but for those who did will pretty much know everything.An excellent sequel, though doesn't surpass the first, not by its flaws, but by the strength that the first gave. It has its ups and downs, but overall a worthy and exciting sequel.",7,0,1,2 December 2010
The Departed," Hands down best crime drama ever!
","Scorsese's all time best film ever made says nothing. This is one of the best directed, acted, produced, and written films made period. Scorsese never fails to impress us, and proves it greatly in this.

This film not only tells it better, but does it better in general. This film includes some of the best performances iv'e ever seen in movies. Every role is convincing as it can be, and every second keeps you on edge until the very end.The story starts out simple, but quickly goes into complex situations that will have you on the edge of your seat. The film takes place in Boston, Massachusetts, where Irish Mob boss Francis 'Frank' Costello plants Colin Sullivan as an informant within the Massachusetts State Police. Simultaneously, the police assign undercover cop William 'Billy' Costigan to infiltrate Costello's crew. When both sides realize the situation, each man attempts to discover the other's true identity before his own cover is blown. Not only a clever story, but it stretches the idea of story telling to incredible boundaries.Leonardo DiCaprio's performance is without a doubt the most underrated performance ever. I honestly think he should have gotten an Oscar, but his highest achievement was a Golden Globe nomination. He's good in the entire movie, but his true performance begins when he starts working with Costello. He becomes psychologically tortured by watching all these innocent lives being tortured by the Irish mob, and by the fact that any minute, his cover could be blown and he could die at any moment. His performance dragged me into the film so much, that I felt so bad for him to the point where I almost cried. Not really, but I felt like it. Everyone else is amazing also, but I think Leo's performance truly puts you in the position of a tortured soul. Jack Nicholson is hilarious as Costello. He's ruthless and violent, but keeps his cool when he needs to. Obviously he's the bad guy, so Leo is always on edge when he's around him. Then when Costello is acting goofy, Leo doesn't know what to do. He pretty much acts like a standard mob boss...having no worries in the world, wanting money and sex. Matt Damon is pretty interesting to watch, because he actually starts to work like an actual cop and help track down Costello, as if he changed sides. Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlburg pretty much work as a group. They're the only ones that know William is undercover, so they pretty much have to babysit him the whole time. Wahlburg is a huge prick in this film, but trust me when I say by the end of this film, you'll love him. But what I don't like is that out of all the amazing performances in this film...He's the only one who gets an Oscar nomination. Really? Out of all those, you chose him? I'm not saying it's not good, but Leo's was way better, I think they all should have gotten one, and if just one, then Leo. I don't get what the Academy liked some much about Mark's performance, but I have to say it's a little overrated. Martin Sheen has a pretty good character. Since Costigan's dad is dead, Sheen treats him like a son, and becomes a father figure. Alec Baldwin is just there for laughs in my opinion...that's about it. Oh, and you got the cop shrink who starts dating Damon, then dating Costigan. She's all right, but she's not all that important.The film combines itself well with comedy. It knows when to be serious, and can be pretty hilarious at times. The funniest performances are probably Baldwin and Nicholson. Oh, and as far as dialogue goes, as long as you constantly say the 'F' word, you pretty much filled in half the script. Not even joking. Too many of them to count.I don't how to describe how brilliant this film is. Scorsese is a mastermind, and knows exactly how to please me every single second, (no homo) If you haven't seen this...SEE IT RIGHT AWAY! It is without a doubt the best crime drama film ever.

The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Terrific conclusion to this epic trilogy.
","For me, the Hobbit films only got better. I enjoyed the first, the second was a huge improvement, then this one just knocked it all out for me. It concludes the epic story in such a stylistic fashion, completing arcs for all characters of the trilogy, bringing you to tears, and for the journey to continue into LOTR.The epic trilogy conclusion follows Bilbo and his Dwarf friends as they prepare for war against the Orc army, while dealing with Oakenshield's inner demons preventing him from associating a truce with the Elves and townspeople of Laketown.The opening scene is the battle with Smaug. The reign of terror by Smaug, followed by his downfall. It's really well done and really well shot. Though part of me feels like it could have just been thrown into the last film at the last second, it makes for one great opening scene.Most of the film is the lengthy battle, hence the title. There's a lot of build up between all the sides of the army. This is the one where I really felt the pressure of the situation. I felt scared for everybody; Bilbo, who's caught in the middle of all of it, Oakenshield, who is forced to make a difficult decision, Legalas, and Bard, who has to lead the people of Laketown in their attempt to recover from the reign of Smaug. I was scared for Gandalf up to when he's freed by Galadriel, Elrond, and Saruman from the evils of Sauron, which perfectly sets up Saruman's following of Sauron.In terms of the battle scenes, outstanding. The action is fluent and fast paced, with spot on choreography. Not to mention certain scenes, (don't wanna spoil) that are soooo freaking awesome I had my jaw dropping for a solid minute. The scenery is beautiful, even though most of your concentration is on the action, the characters use the environment to their advantage to progress the battle. It's such an amazing battle of epic proportions, because so much stuff is happening at once, you're all over the place.I will say a lot of the character confrontations are pretty much over and done with during the fight, but that's kind of the point. One book stretched into 3 movies, it all comes down to this, and it does a heck of a job.I was not expecting to be so wrapped up into the character, which really hit me hard at the end, of it all, I ended up crying. The ending was one of my favorite parts, it perfectly concludes this story and perfectly wraps it into LOTR, you just get goosebumps the way they do it, perfect!If you're interested in epic battle scenes that blow your mind every second, then I highly recommend this. I enjoyed every second of it, simply too epic to not enjoy.",8,4,8,9 January 2015
Inception," Mesmerizing!!!
","Although considered a more complicated Matrix, this film has a lot more to hand us than it, such as a plot 10x more complicating from the beginning, and getting more and more complicating, tremendous performances by DiCaprio, Levitt, and Page, and excellent effects.This movie goes quite further into the story than most films, dealing with peoples dreams, subconscious's, and emotions. Only someone like Nolan would create something like this, especially after the movie Memento, and the Dark Knight. Of course quite lengthy, it still manages to go through with the story as planned without getting things in the way. Right at the beginning, I was immediately confused, but as the movie goes through, things get explained and leave you positive.Leo DiCaprio plays an experienced thief named Cob, who lives in a world where the technology to go into people's dreams exist. He, along with six other people use the device known as Inception to enter the dreams of each other to gain intelligence to save their world. Going deeper and deeper and deeper, their always on their toes to make it out alive.Like I said, the movie is quite confusing, since it starts off the plot soon. There's a lot more to go into, of course, such as the conditions required. The characters are all likable, it was tough to choose which one I like the most. You would think I like DiCaprio, but I honestly like Levitt's character the best. Not just because he's pretty awesome in that film, but also because he's Roger from Angels in the Outfield.From beginning to end, your always on edge, trying to learn and get everything. It will defiantly be hard to keep up with the plot, but it will all be solved soon. Its a movie you really need to see twice. The first time, to understand the concept, and the second time to just enjoy the film. I appreciated the editing job they put into this, by making it so dramatic and intense, helped out by Hans Zimmer's music score.Although long, it kinda has to be to fit the quality of the moments. It really doesn't have any pointless scenes. Every scene just about contributes to the plot in anyway. But don't get me wrong, it still manages to keep its cool on the ground level, but even for a well edited film, it still takes awhile. The plot starts off well, but the movie itself takes awhile, and by that I mean the time.One of Nolan's greatest films by far and one of the best blockbusters of this summer!",8,1,5,8 August 2010
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," A play in disguise as a film.
","To me this film defines art. It's a phenomenon that will be remembered in cinema for years to come, and the best comeback of any actor I've ever seen by the superhero himself, Michael Keaton.A washed-up actor, (Michael Keaton) who once played an iconic superhero must overcome his ego and family trouble as he mounts a Broadway play in a bid to reclaim his past glory.Everything about this film is art. From the filming to the acting, to the tone, to the satire, this film is a superfilm. It's a play in the sense that most of the movie is a series of 30 minute continuous shots that showcase the behind the scenes of Broadway, from the actors, to Riggan's personal and business issues, etc. So much is going on, but you feel like part of the action. The film's satire is out of this world, taking on topics about the cultural genocide of our society, thinking behind an actor, a director, and even a film critic. It's the best satire I've ever seen in my life.It doesn't stop there, there's tons of superhero references from films, to clichés, etc. It's all about Keaton dealing with his ego from his superhero counterpart. The film takes several risks, hits em every time, but they're so smooth and subtle that it hits perfectly.The all star cast is irresistible, as everybody is perfectly cast. Emma Stone as Keaton's daughter who deals with drug recovery is truly supportive, Edward Norton is badass as usual, and Zach Galifianakis is hilarious as always.If this film doesn't win the Oscar for best picture, then I have no hope for humanity. It deserves it much more than any other film I've seen, so I got my fingers crossed.",9,3,10,10 January 2015
Platoon," Charlie Sheen's breakthrough performance!
","Not really big on Oliver Stone, but his depiction of the Vietnam war is brilliant in this heavy, dark tribute to the men who died in the war.Charlie Sheen, Tom Berenger, and Willam Dafoe all make one big triangle in this film, as it revolves around the conflict going on between them, and by them, I mean Willem Dafoe's squad, and Tom Berenger's squad in the Platoon, while Charlie Sheen is caught in the middle to deal with both, struggling to maintain his sanity as the depression of the war gets to him every day.All performances are excellent. Even though the beginning consists of Sheen being an innocent little girly man, the war progresses, and he becomes a brutal life risking grunt that ruthlessly kills everything in his path, showing how the war affects him mentally.The sound of the film sounds muddled every time somebody opens their mouth, not sure what Stone's intentions were, but it won the Oscar for sound, so whatever. The film isn't centered around combat, or the realism of war, it's centered around the duality of men, and how the war affects the minds of the soldiers, and the different types of soldiers that faced the war.The beginning scenes consist of the Platoon getting to know each other, leading up to one of the most infamous and controversial scenes in cinema history, the village. It's interesting to see different characters of different personalities conflict each other over being with a different squad leader, like are you guys in high school? Either way they find a way to make it more intense.Not too heavy on atmosphere, history, or in depth messaging like Apocalypse Now or The Deer Hunter, but it gets it around pretty easy, and the message about the war bringing out the best or the worst in men is carried out pretty easy also. Very excellent war film, isn't along the lines of Saving Private Ryan, (my favorite war film) but definitely give it a viewing.",9,2,3,8 July 2013
Halloween," Thrilling masterpiece!
","John Carpenter's classic horror thriller with one of the most iconic horror film villains of all, Michael Myers. An absolute masterpiece to say the least, with plenty of scares and shocks for everyone, without having to be too gory as well.Starts out with a terrific music theme by John Carpenter himself, and begins on a perfect note. 8-year-old Michael Myers murders his older sister on Halloween night in Haddonfield, Illinois, and is sent to an institution. 15 years later, his doctor comes to take him to court to be executed. However, he escapes in a car and returns home, where he stalks a teenage babysitter named Laurie Strode, (Jamie Lee Curtis's first role). The doctor returns and teams up with the police sheriff to hunt him down.It really starts getting good when he starts stalking Laurie and her friends. Not being too gory or graphic, this film will still without a doubt scare the hell out of you, that is if your a beginning horror film watcher. It mostly depends on shocks and edgy stalking scenes.John Carpenter also devotes his love for horror films by having scenes of people watching such films as The Thing from Another World. The characters do get kind of stupid, pretending like nothing would happen and get themselves in easy to kill situations, like Laurie locking herself in a closet, hoping he's dumb enough not to check there. But with the seventies new slasher genre, you can't expect much. Its also eerie how Michael is referred to as the boogey man, which he kind of seems like.Its only a matter of time before a few more directors get together to make a crap load of sequels, and mock the crap out of the freaking movie. Whether unneeded or not, it could've been find with just this one. But no, they just had to make more. f**k that s**t!I recommend watching it. But don't waste your time watching the others like I made the mistake of doing. This is truly the only good one, so the others are just for nothing.",7,0,2,27 October 2010
Back to the Future Part II," Not as good as the first, but a worthy sequel.
","Although it doesn't surpass the first one, which is a hard task to do anyway, its still a powerful and brilliant sequel that excellently continues the saga. Filled with silly jokes and comical, and dramatic irony, with the same characters as the first, with a few twists, but are still all the more lovable.Marty, Doc, and Jenny, Martie's girlfriend, travel to the year 2015 to resolve a conflict involving Martie's son. They return to the present time only to see that its a violent and mad world taken over by Biff, the bully in the first. Apparently while in the future, Marty bought a Sports Almanac, (a book showing the results of each sporting event in the 20th century) which Biff gets his hands on, turning him rich in the future. Marty and Doc go back to the year 1955 to redo the events in the first, and get the almanac from Biff, which he got from his future self.The story gets a little confusing, but its well explained, and also shows to prove things as well. Some of the events were quite unnecessary, and the scenes back in 1955 kind of borrow from the first a little. But it still stays strong with the irony, with clever jokes and humor.The doc remains his ordinarily crazy self, along with many other characters. Although there's no certain point in specific on where they stay on, it is definitely more adventurous and more agile.Like I said before, not as good, but a positive and worthy sequel.",7,0,1,6 June 2010
Carrie," Depressing rather than scary.
","This movie depressed me rather than scare me. It was horrific at the end, but everything else is just depressing. I know Brian De Palma was just following the book by Stephen King, and thats just find. But in general, the plot, and the depression was so terrible I just couldn't like it. I'm not saying De Palma could have made it better, just didn't like the story itself in general.It revolves around a shy high schooler named Carrie who is constantly picked on by the girls at her school, and her abusively religious mom. She soon finds out that she has telekinetic powers. She's asked by the most handsome guy in school to prom, where a few girls plan to play another trick on her, little do they know whats in store for them.A lot of the film is just her being treated like poop, until the final climax in the end, which is downright terror. I think my favorite character is the gym teacher, the only person in her life who has sympathy for her, and does her best to help her. My least favorite character by far was the mom. A complete psychopath!I just couldn't take the depression in this film. It calls itself a horror film. Though most of the film just seems like a teen drama, that is until the end. I was so shocked by how badly Carrie was treated. I mean my God, she was freaking hated to death. Looking at her would make any other depressed person not feel as bad. Most of the characters consist of mean girls, crazy psychopaths, or Carrie. But what do you really expect from Stephen King, not to mention this was his first novel. Mix that with Brian De Palma's love for violence, depression and gore, and this is what you get.Nothing but a nonstop series of depressing moments. A few parts were entertaining, but in general didn't do it for me. Like I said before, Its not really De Palma's fault, its just the idea in general. So its actually Stephen King's fault. The movie wasn't really bad, just didn't like the idea of the plot, so maybe the movies not that bad, but this is what I think of it.",5,1,5,18 February 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," Didn't please me as much as the Dark Knight.
","After a hot hit with the Dark Knight and Inception, Christopher Nolan probably has the mindset that everything he'll make will be great no matter what. No saying that's true, but that seems to be the case with this film. He figured he'd try to make it more complex in the story, more groundbreaking in the effects and action, and try with an interesting villain. It both worked and didn't work.I'm going to go ahead and say that this is my least favorite of the Christopher Nolan Batman trilogy. Batman Begins was amazing, the Dark Knight was a masterpiece, then we have this, which is decent, but that's it. So many expectations came to this movie, and with little payoff. As good as the movie was, I was rather disappointed by it. I enjoyed watching it, but nothing really blew me away.Synopsis: 8 years after Batman stops the Joker, a retired and disabled Bruce Wayne hides in shadows, watching Gotham crumble with the lack of donations from the Wayne enterprises charities. The villain they give us in this one is Bane, who appears and threatens Gotham with bombs, forcing himself leader of the town, forcing Batman to appear and save Gotham. Not to mention Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle, aka Catwoman.The beginning is slow, the middle part is the best, and even it gets confusing, and the ending is a cop out.Christopher Nolan figured the more complex it gets, the more interesting it will get, but truthfully, it just gets tiring, not to mention its cheap stab at humor here and there. I just didn't see it in this one. In the Dark Knight, everything played so smooth, and in this, it's just sort of played out normal, nothing mind blowing.The ending is a huge cop out in my opinion. He's gonna sacrifice his life for Gotham by taking the bomb in the ocean. Nope, autopilot saves the day. That makes him seem like a pussy and not a true hero that would risk his life. If he died, it would have made a lot more of an impact, but nope, ends cheerful happy, everybody lives. Biggest problem with the film.All together, as much as I liked it, it was underwhelming compared to The Dark Knight.",7,4,8,24 July 2012
Toy Story 3," excellent conclusion to the greatest trilogy ever!!!
","Whether your a toddler, a child, a teenager, or an adult, you will love this film, especially if you love Pixar, which is about everybody out there. Every Pixar movie, with the exception of Cars, is terrific, but the best is Toy Story. Toy Story 2 was also great, but then this came and perfectly concluded the trilogy, surpassing Toy Story 2. Pixar's first trilogy, and the greatest trilogy ever!Also the funniest Pixar film, even though its not as good as the first, but just by a tiny bit. It has comedy, action, and tons of emotion. Has a really clever plot, which borrows from The Great Escape a little bit.Andy is heading out to college, leaving the toys in depression. They get donated to a Daycare center which looks like a toy paradise, but turns out to be a prison led by a pink bear named Lotso where new toys are played with by roudy toddlers that play with them like rag dolls, in which they plot to escape.The fact that the first was the first movie I've ever seen is the only reason I like it better, but this film is not only funnier, but is a lot more epic, of course thats because its the last one, with the most emotional ending in Pixar. You will cry watching this film if you are a fan of Pixar, guaranteed. I don't just love the ending, but I can't help but think back at the other ones. Its emotional not just for the movie, but it even reminds me of when I had to give something up that I really liked in my childhood, such as my Rescue Heroes, or my Dragon Ball Z action figures, or even some Toy Story toys that I had of my own. No matter what you think, never feel the movie's plot is fading throughout, cause in the end it will all be resolved.You will be stunned by how good this film is. It was 10x better than what I expected. Without a doubt the second best Pixar film, and also one of my top ten favorite films.",10,3,4,22 June 2010
The Sixth Sense," Something else!
","This movie shocked and spooked me throughout the whole way. Dark moments and scenes here and there, but still remains to stay calm when necessary. Its one of the rarest films by M. Night Shyamalan thats actually good. Not to be offensive, but most of his movies suck. But this one was quite decent, a masterpiece at best.Bruce Willis is a child psychologist named Malcolm Crowe who helps out a disturbed child, (Haley Joel Osment) who has visions of dead people. By doing this, his wife becomes depressed over his absence, (or at least thats what he thinks) which causes him to decide between helping the kid, or his wife.The story itself is excellent, opening with a bone chilling scene. Not to mention a surprising ending that will leave you haunted for days. The acting performances are phenomenal, mostly Osment, who received an Oscar nomination. Also includes Toni Collete, Olivia Williams, and a cameo of Shyamalan as a doctor. The music by James Newton Howard gave me goosebumps for the whole movie. One of his best scores ever in my opinion. Unlike Ghost, which is a little similar, this one doesn't have crappy effects thrown in it, but rather suspenseful situations based on sense, given this movie's title.This film couldn't have been any better. Everything work perfectly. The only reason for not a 9 or 10 is simply based on movie type. But all together this film was excellent.",8,0,0,24 August 2010
The Matrix," A world without rules, without limits.
","Wachowski brothers Andy and Lana create this mesmerizing sci-fi action film with awesome up the ass visual effects, solid editing, and an excellent cast. Keanu Reeves and Lawrence Fishbourne make a great team as two righteous individuals who go on a journey into another world, as they travel to the extent of visuals unimaginable.Keanu Reeves stars as a computer hacker named Neo who goes through a weird series of incidents, and wines up in a different dimensional world with a mysterious man named Morpheus, along with a group of other people, as he learns the truth about mankind, and is shown a whole other world beyond the eyes.Entertains you from beginning to end in a very bad ass way. Acting performances aren't the best, along with the slanted story due to the visuals, but doesn't bother you the least bit, if not just for a little bit. Your too concentrated on the stunning visuals, and the terrific editing, which is probably where this movie does best.Although it takes awhile for the action to start, its all worth it when it finally kicks off, with insane action scenes that will get you all pumped up. Clever choreography, with fighting techniques, as well as shooting scenes included. Sound effects are awesome, and go great with the action.I could go on forever, but in short, the visuals, action scenes, and editing are the three best things to look for in this film.",8,0,1,24 June 2010
Looper," Best film of 2012.
","Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon Levitt join forces and tackle the sci-fi genre after Inception and Die Hard. Very interesting story mixed with sci-fi action, along with Bruce Willis's humor and Levitt's charm. So far, the most interesting film of 2012. Not too far ahead of The Dark Knight Rises, which to be honest was kind of disappointing, but still good. This film takes us on something not yet seen.In the year 2074, outlawed time traveling will be used by the mafia to send people they want dead back to the year 2044, where they are killed by hired assassins called 'loopers'. They do this for the mafia until their older selves are sent back and are killed by them, called 'closing the loop'. Joseph Gordon Levitt, a looper who is very happy with his job, encounters his old self, (Bruce Willis) who gets the drop on him, causing him to go on a hunt in order to close his loop.Some may call it another typical time travel story, but I disagree completely. I think it brings a fresh intake on sci-fi action. Doesn't get very confusing like most time traveling films, and manages to keep you interested with the story and characters all the way. You even stay connected with Bruce Willis as the antagonist, which is hard to do.Film, (unlike others) doesn't get carried away with CGI and go full blown in your face visuals. It stays par and only uses visuals when it absolutely needs to. Manages to keep the story interesting, even when things calm down. I stayed interested every second. Not a moment of the film seemed slow or out of place. Some might fine the time traveling making no sense, but that's if you think about it too much. So ignore that and you got a heck of a ride.This film is one of the first decent sci-fi films that have been released in a while. Great story, great characters, and a great cast. Willis and Levitt make a great pair together. Definitely worth watching. Better the second time for sure.",8,0,2,25 October 2012
Cube," Perfect concept for the independent production it came from.
","Out of Saw, Phone Booth, Buried, or any other independent thrillers, this one is by far the most unique. The concept alone is enough to give it the edge. With Night of the Living dead related cheesiness, lame acting, semi-lame screenplay, weird sets etc, the premise alone is enough for it to get by. 6 strangers wake up in a cube shaped room, with no idea how they got there. Every other room they visit via airlock hatch on the walls leads to an identical room with a different color. Realizing that most of the rooms are booby trapped, they must put their heads together to find a way out of the deathtrap.The characters, though aren't acted well, are entertainingly over the top. Worth and Kazaan are the best. The question of who is doing this and why pops up a lot in the group. Later on you realize that Worth was hired by an unknown to design the outer shell of the compound, and the original purpose is unknown, which is quite fascinating. It's a film with no answers, it's just in your face is all you get.The filming is done super quirky. It's got still shots of sets, and very draggy camera movement, it makes me feel like i'm in less produced and badly acted Stanley Kubrick film. The booby traps are pretty cool as well, making for some entertaining scenes. Even though it isn't the smartest thriller, it's definitely a fascinating concept that is carried by over the top actors, insane sets, and interesting concepts of humanity.",7,0,1,28 January 2015
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Best comedy of all time.
","With that said, it isn't my favorite comedy of all time, but it's up there. It's a parody film that has fun with every single scene it consists of. It takes full advantage of the tiniest bit of a comedy opportunity in a scene. It created a legacy of Monty Python for years to come.The casting is absolutely grand. Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones, Michael Palin, etc. Everyone has their own charm to their performances, and are all very memorable.The film mixes its dialog from med evil times to some modern dialog in terms of language, slang at times, which is small but really effective. It shows that the film doesn't hold back or has boundaries. It's chock full of parody from an array of topics.The scenery is beautiful, some scenes are cheesy for the sake of being cheesy, but effects, landscapes, and other areas are simply great looking. The film takes advantage of every little bit of the environment.This film has endless amounts of famous quotes and scenes, which is why I think it's the best comedy of all time. It's a film you can either mellow out and relax watching, or pay full attention and study. It's an adventure from beginning to end, that is fun and timeless forever and always.",8,0,2,15 February 2015
The Social Network," Fascinating Topic!
","As a person whose had a Facebook for awhile, I never thought once to how or when it was made, or under what circumstances. Who would've ever thought to make an actual film about the story behind the creators of the popular blog site, Facebook, and what led them to making it. The history behind it is a lot more than I would think. And in this box- office success, it takes us far into the story of how it all started.After being dumped by his girlfriend, Harvard University student Mark Zuckerberg, (Jesse Eisenburg) along with his skilled computer friends, are assigned to create a new blog site by the Winklevoss twins. In no time, they officially create Facebook. But conflicts arise when the twins blame them for stealing their idea. As Facebook becomes more and more popular, Mark becomes one of the most famous people in the world, and to this day is the youngest billionaire in the world.One thing I loved right off the back about this film was how intelligent the dialogue was. As the beginning progresses, Mark starts hacking into the Harvard computer system which is a very entertaining scene. He starts typing all his notes and thoughts really fast. The editing in this movie killed. I expect an Oscar nomination from this film. It went by quite smooth.One downfall was the main character. For one thing, he's a real jerk. Yet you feel like your suppose to care for him and like him, which makes you struggle to decide whether you like him or not. I for one liked him, despite his rudeness sometimes. Although they might have twisted the actual person's attitude, the film somehow got away with it.The other characters are just okay, with Andrew Garfield playing Eduardo Saverin (the vice president of Facebook). He starts getting angry with Mark for taking most of the credit for creating Facebook, leaving him in the dust. Justin Timberlake as Sean Parker was also a lame character, who takes part in Facebook, and turns it upside down.For what it is, I really liked this film a lot. The characters, the fast paced editing, the idea, and just everything else. With a few flaws, it still turns into a 8/10.",10,2,4,27 October 2010
The Pursuit of Happyness," Will Smith is as inspirational as ever.
","This is one of the most inspirational films I have ever seen. Although not too complex on conflict or message, it's still a positive message that carries through all of us. Will Smith brilliantly shows us not only that he's a great actor, but a great father, as the character's son is portrayed by Smith's real life son Jaden.Based on a true story of Chris Gardner, an entrepreneur who became homeless in 1981 with his 5-year-old son, and for 6 months worked as an unpaid internship to gain a job as a stock broker. Never giving up and always finding faith with his son kept him alive and happy.Smith gives an unbelievably wonderful performance, portrays his character in terms of his emotions. Very aggressive when he's happy, sad, angry, etc. His son is the perfect sidekick and the motivation for him to never give up. Throughout the film, he, while struggling, manages to stay hopeful with his son, whom he does his best to keep happy through their struggle. Although some argue that the relationship doesn't work for Smith's over the top aggression on his son sometimes, I think it brings out the film's struggle even more, and all together I think the relationship is what makes this film work. They have that energy that makes you want to see them make it.I think Smith pulled this off so well because since it's his actual son, and not some actor portraying his son, he cares more about him, making him more concerned in a position of him being broke. It was all natural for Smith and he nailed it.If I had one thing to argue about, it'd be that they try too hard to show us him struggling. Like it's one after another, this happened, then I had to pay this, like it's not too bad, but after a while it can get repetitive, but who cares. The film works so well, and never fails to work me up in the end, (you'll see). Definitely a non forgettable inspiration that will never be forgotten. Smith's best performance!",8,0,0,18 August 2013
Back to the Future," 'what are you looking at, butthead!'
","Anyone who lives on the planet Earth has got to love this film. It's one of the the greatest sci-fi classics of all time. Director Robert Zemeckis, along with producer/director Steven Spielberg, and many other great movie makers, invent the greatest comedy of all time.However you look at it, whether as an action film, a comedy, a sci-fi, or whatever, it will look excellent no matter what. The effects and sound effects are spectacular, but the hook into the film are the hilarious and lovable characters, the terrific performances, and the editing job put into the film. The story is one of the greatest screenplays ever.Marty Mcfly is an average teen in 1985 whose friend, Doc Brown, invents a time machine out of a Dolorian. Marty accidentally activates it while running from terrorists, and travels to the year 1955, where he meets his parents-to-be as teens, screwing up their first meet. On top of getting them back together, he teams up with the past Doc Brown to fix the time machine to be able to send him back to his time period. The conflicts and plot of the story are all spectacular and work brilliantly to the core.Has tons of laughs along the way. The doc, played by Christopher Lloyd, is without a doubt the best character. His crazy scientist ways will have your gut busted with laughter. The clever irony works terrificly as well, especially with scenes with Martie's teen parents. Conflicts arise, and the film gets more and more entertaining by the minute. Another great character is Biff, who was an old bully of Martie's dad, who becomes one of the main antagonists in the film, as he plans to take Martie's mom, and dispose of Martie's dad. Although he's evil, he still makes you laugh hard.Ends happily, but without spoiling anything, its a simple masterpiece that must be seen.",10,1,1,6 June 2010
Princess Mononoke," One of Miyazaki's best!
","This is absolutely my 2nd favorite Miyazaki film, the first being Spirited Away. It's definitely one of the more adult animes I've ever seen, and I'm a huge fan of those. I love animes with dark and gritty themes that explore the realms of fantasy, which this film has covered.When a prince from a village is infected with a curse by a demon, he must travel to the West to find a cure, only to find a war being waged between the Gods of the forest/San, the wolf woman of the forest, and the mining town of Irontown, led by Lady Eboshi.Although the themes are centered around the environment, it doesn't include the typical 'man is evil' message from every other Dances with Wolves or Pocahontas film. Lady Eboshi is likable and reasonable. San is strong willed and protective of the forest, but she has her own faults as well. It's simply about getting over differences when both sides are at fault. It's more about controlling hate and willing to compromise to keep the peace. Even though some of the dialogue kind of forces it in your face, it's still a natural feeling in the end.The animation is fantastic. The lighting and colors are elegant, and the camera angles on certain scenes is stunning. The animation in Miyazaki's films have stylistically evolved over the course of his career, and it shows.The film has a strong emphasis on fantasy. Although it takes itself very realistically and adult, the forest elements involving spirits are not only beautiful, but very powerfully introduced and used. With that said, the fighting scenes are incredibly realistic and entertaining to no end, mostly because of the amazing animation that goes with it.The story is told very quickly, sidestepping when necessary and getting right down to things, which is what I love about it. It doesn't drag, it's long, but very entertaining. There's no bs in this film whatsoever.It's a must see, there's nothing else to say. I recommend the dubbed version for Billy Bob Thorton's voice, it's irresistible. It's not as good as Spirited Away, but it's right there, one of the best animated films of all time.",8,1,2,1 March 2015
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Welcome back John Turturro
","Inspired by 'The Odyssey', three escaped convicts from the South in the 1930's set out to find hidden treasure, a rumor told to them by an old man.I was very entertained by this film. It has a realistic depiction with a touch of fantasy to it, one that will really skew into some goofy scenes. It's a film that plays with your suspension of disbelief for a little, but stays focused nonetheless. The cast was well picked out, with George Clooney and John Turturro as the lead, as well as Tim Blake Nelson, all of which do an amazing job. The tone is one of the best parts of the movie. It should be a drama, given the source material and the setting, but it plays off as a light comedy, with several over the top scenes that set up for an excellent music score. The songs in this had me humming for days, T Bone Burnett really did a good job in capturing the tone and time period for the film, and it pays off.The film at times feels a little clustered, with some big stars that don't get as much screen time. Holly Hunter is pretty top billed, but isn't around until three fourths of the movie. The film is adapting itself into The Odyssey, so there are some appropriately added scenes that are there to be symbolism, and even though it's well done, it kind of slows down the adventurous pace. With that, the fantasy element of this film is strong, I feel like anything can happen in this movie, and that anything is possible, a free feeling I don't get in movies very often.Not one of my favorite Coen's, but entertaining nonetheless, with some great characters, interesting storytelling, and a fun tone and excellent music.",7,0,0,24 February 2016
The Godfather," A movie you can't refuse.
","Living up to the edge of this film is what each mob film stands for. This is the film that started the mob genre in my opinion. A classic story in its own mind, and a perfect hit to cinema. Based off the saga by Mario Puzo, director Francis Ford Coppola's first chapter of the epic legacy that lives on as The Godfather. The tale of a crime organization in the 1940s that go into a struggle for power when the leader is shot and hospitalized in a conspiracy, though continuously tended by his trusted sons, played by some of the now famous actors ever, including James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Al Pacino. Terrificly follows the novel, with solid editing and setting, and outstanding performances by everybody. Fits elements that put you into the shoes of a true mobster, dealing with real mandatory things in a crime family, jobs, deaths, and deals. Marlon Brando as Don Corleone is a magnificent performance that really gets into the character of a true mob leader, making offers people can't refuse. Coppola's best work ever, and one of the greatest films ever made!",8,1,3,6 June 2010
