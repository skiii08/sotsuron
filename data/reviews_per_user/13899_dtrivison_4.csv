Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Big Yellow Unit Rules
","I think a lot of people maybe missed the point about this film The total of what it is, is an Uma Thurman love fest, told against the backdrop of men that have only contempt for women. It's excellent to see the other guys have a say-or shall we make that, a final word.Plus, I give Uma Thurman a lot of credit. The demands of making love with Quentin Tarantino were gargantuan. (I love that word, but I hardly ever get to use it in a complete sentence.)The visuals in the film were excellent and I think Mr. Tarantino's strongest skills. The contrast of b&w scenes, color scenes, and colorized scenes, and even `home movie' footage, the highly stylized costuming, the lighting perfectly effective throughout. Even the soundtrack is nice and effective in volume 2, as it definitely was not in volume 1.So what if it's a lame story (it totally is). So what if David Carradine has an annoying lisp (and it is very annoying). So what if kung fu guy's hair style rivals Donald Trump's. None of it matters. Because, Mommy rules!
Thanks for the fun, QT.",Null,0,1,12 May 2004
Before Sunset," Small film with big heart
","Before Sunset was a small film with big heart, even if for just one night. There was something about that night that had staying power. Or so we are told... and I for one believed it.The characters were convicing and as their respective lives unfolded through self-revelation, we see a couple that quite like each other. And might have been together, except for fate, her grandmother's death as it were, or more likely, cold feet. C'est la vie.I went to this film expecting engaging dialog, nice Paris scenery, two pretty faces, and solid acting. Though I did not get all that, what I did get was memorable. What the film lacked in good looks, it made up for in strong writing and delivery, and in retrospect, the look (or lack thereof) may in fact have complimented the smallness of the film.One message I found worth repeating. There's a point in life where we realize it's not so easy anymore to really connect. We find we've dug in. Finding another person who dug nearby becomes a rare find. One that should be celebrated. If only for just one night.",Null,0,0,31 July 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Kill Bill --Kill him good
","Except for Lucy Liu's freckles, this was a pretty good film. QT sets a sumptuous table: with a yellow running suit the centerpiece. The sound of it --on the other hand, was so annoying, I think if the so called composer had been sitting in front of me in the theater I'd have kicked his chair. Which proves a point, having an interest in something alone does not make for talent or even good taste. (I'm with you Simon Cowell: the guy is a disaster.) That aside, the music really wasn't the point. Gushers of blood was the point!!! Whoever would've thought there was so much internal pressure in a bad guy? No slow seepage here; it was as if someone had opened a fire hydrant. Quite refreshing -whoosh. This film is a huge spectacle. Now I'll be interesting to meet the characters.",Null,0,1,25 April 2004
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Struck deep
","Eternal sunshine struck deep, and I enthusiastically recommend it as an post-modern treatment of an age-old subject, love, who we love and why we love. This film is starkly real, as is much of the film's imagery. The characters are totally human and totally honest. And even though the thing was literally loaded with more-or-less standard symbolism: ocean and sand for emotion and despair, dark, empty house for delving into intimacy, and so on, the camera and editing was so cleverly handled that for me, none of it ever became cliche. Besides, watching it all is just a lot of fun. Seeing Ruffalo and Dunst dancing in their underwear was worth the price of admission alone. I also appreciated that the plot, though not totally straight-forward, was illustrated sufficiently clearly so putting it in order was easy.My favorite part was at the very end when Joel responded to Clementine's submission about her own character. Just the way he said, 'Okay.' With one word the depth of the need of the sensitive human spirit to 'connect' with one special beloved person was summed up. Love triumphed when Joel was able to say, okay, and mean it. It was okay to be vulnerable and forgive, for the prospect of companionship.Though Eternal sunshine is about forgetting, I doubt I will.",Null,0,1,4 April 2004
