Vertigo," Overrated Ridiculous Sexist Rubbish
","This was one of the stupidest movies I've seen. How anyone thinks this is a classic is beyond fathom. 'Scotty' rescues a married 'Madeline' from drowning and instead of getting her medical attention, he brings her - passed out - to his home, UNDRESSES HER COMPLETELY and puts her in his bed, naked. Two days and very little conversation later and they are suddenly desperately in love. Scotty forces 'Madeline' to kiss him even after she begs him to stop and runs away. The disappearance of 'Madeline' from the hotel is never explained, so the hotel keeper must have been in on the scheme? His friend Midge serves as little more than a semi-jealous prop. His stay in the mental institution is totally superfluous and pointless to the plot. He 'just happens' to see Judy walking by the same flower shop 'Madeline' would get her flowers from (that just happened to be carrying the same specialty bouquet she used to buy).Judy hides all the evidence of her crime from Scotty but then just 'forgets' about the dead woman's necklace (that was part of the plot to kill the real Madeline as she had sat staring at it in the painting for days), and wears it right in front of him...? Then (after submitting to a complete makeover to 'please her man'), 'Judy' accidentally flops out a window to her death when she is startled by a nun. Flopping out of Scotty's embrace, through a window, and over a ledge at least 3 feet from where she was standing. Scotty has to take a few steps to reach the ledge to look down at her, but she just tumbled out from the same spot? Then Scotty and the nun just stand and stare at her (presumed) corpse and 'The End'. The kissing was uncomfortably weirdly fake, the emotion was unnatural, the music was intrusive, and the plot was incredibly stupid. I thought it would never end. This movie is the epitome of 'overrated'.I went into this movie wanting to LOVE it. My mom loved Hitchcock, this was recently voted 'best movie ever', and I love San Francisco. Ugh. This movie was a complete letdown and I think the people who love it so much have very low expectations and/or are blinded by the 'classic' and 'Hitchcock' labels and their romanticism of the good old days of sexist tedium. This is the modern day version of some over-hyped dribble such as Battleship or Twilight.",Null,19,32,27 August 2012
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Mostly Great
","I really detested the opening credits sequence. It was lovely as a music video, but I was thinking 'Bond' the entire time. It didn't fit the theme of the story at all and I was baffled by it. The movie was excellent though. Lisbeth was played beautifully by Rooney Mara, maybe showing a little too much emotion on occasion, but nothing unforgivable. Daniel Craig was great as Blomkvist. The only thing I was particularly annoyed about was that they changed the entire conclusion to the missing girl - where, how, who, etc. It seemed like a stupid thing to do considering the rest of the story being so true to the book. It breaks my heart to say, but I felt like Reznor's score occasionally became intrusive and out of place. Though it was also really good at times.Overall: I enjoyed it and am looking forward to the next two films in the series.",Null,12,25,13 December 2011
