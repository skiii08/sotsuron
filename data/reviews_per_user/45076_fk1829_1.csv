The Blair Witch Project," tacky, boring.....better re-watch your old home videos!
","With all the mega-hype surrounding this movie, I thought I'd have a tough time sleeping after watching it. But that didn't happen, because most of the footage was pretty boring stuff. The ending was as ambiguous as it gets while there was a shot in the movie which obviously a  3rd person [not the campers themselves] had taken, which gave it all away. Damn- It did'nt even give the  thrills! There was a joke on in our school that a bunch of us students could've made it in the hills surrounding Islamabad [in Pakistan, thats where I live!]. We have pretty much the same type of trees, brooks and rapids here,as in the movie,so making one wouldn't have been a big deal!Pretty awful for a movie that exceeded $100 million in its collections.A '2'on 10, and that too just for the novel idea. This aint a movie, just a cleverly packaged home video, which is something that it meant to be, anyway!",Null,0,1,31 January 2002
