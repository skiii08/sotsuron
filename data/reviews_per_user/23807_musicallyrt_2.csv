Source Code," Absolutely terrible.
","This was without doubt one of the most horrible movies I have ever seen (yes, even worse than anything Tommy Wiseau has cooked up). The 'plot' (I do not think that it is worthy of that word) has gaping wide plot holes. The 'science' behind the plot is absurd; there is no logic present whatsoever (how is it possible for somebody to send text messages across multiple dimensions? How is it possible to exist in two dimensions at once?). Wait a second - I think I'm missing something - how is it possible to even have two dimensions? The 'scientist' presents this pseudo scientific feat rather casually, and no time is given to explain how something like that can exist.The concept that a brain can still operate at the height of what Gyllenhaal's character can in 'limbo' is ridiculous. The complete lack of deductive reasoning on the part of the military personnel is also frustrating. If the person responsible for planting the bomb is intending to blow up a second target, then surely they must be alive to do so. Ergo, Mr Bomb man must not have been on the train at the time of the explosion. So shouldn't your first concern be not the people ON the train during the explosion, but the people getting OFF the train? In addition, how can you be certain that the bomber would be on the train in the 8 minute time slot that the protagonist had access to? However, my biggest beef with this film is not the absolute lack of logic and reasoning, but rather in its completely dull and repetitive nature. The audience is presented with THE SAME EIGHT MINUTES of footage ad nauseam, with slight relief from little dialogues of our dead soldier trying to deduce how he possibly could be existing in somebody else's soon to be dead body. In the case of this film, intentionally repetitive is still mind numbingly repetitive. This has been described as a 'thriller', but it's hard to feel thrilled when you know if the protagonist screws up, he can just go back and do it all again.I'm not even going to comment on the blatant patriotic American self righteous and militaristic war on terror bullshit propaganda 'subtly' woven in.The performance of the acting is okay. Not great, not bad, but okay. It's hard to pay attention to the performance of the cast with the absurdity of the dialogue.Oh, and the protagonist also walks of with the teachers life in his alternate reality. There is no mention of the morality of this.Intellectual nonsense, coupled with frustratingly repetitive scenes makes this film a flop. I would rate this film 0 stars, but that isn't an option :( If you have a shred of taste and intellectuality, then I encourage you to save yourself the pain of sitting through this film.",1,5,11,17 October 2011
Se7en," Trash
","I only ever take the trouble to review movies that I truly despise, and Se7en is one of them. The film is a trite, cliché and asinine piece - whilst possessing some virtues, is composed primarily of sins. A quick note - other reviews seem to be criticising the 'excessive' violence and gore in this film - what do you expect from a film about a serial killer? Firstly - the acting is good, for the most part. Freeman is good as the Dashiell Hammet/Raymond Chandler inspired cynical old cop. Brad Pitt overacts every time he is on screen, making his unbearable character even more unbearable. Kevin Spacey does a suitably creepy (albeit cliché) job of portraying a sadistic, masochistic serial killer.However, my main beefs with the film lies not in the acting, but in the plot. There are plot holes abound (I encourage you to read the review 'se7en problems with se7en') but this isn't the only place where the film falls short. The entire story is predictable - as soon as we are introduced to Paltrow's character we know that she's going to be the subject of some nasty work. The final scene has to be one of the biggest anti-climaxes in film history...The religious fundamentalist angle. Not that I'm overtly sensitive to negative portrayals of religion, but it's getting a bit trite, don't you think? John Doe (And yes, that's the name of the antagonist in this film...) killing so-and-so because the Big Man Upstairs told him so. I mean, why can't we have a serial killer inspired by Nietszche or Stephen Hawkings or Isaac Newton? Why does it always have to be religion? The 'tributes' to film noir include the colour palette used (yup, you guessed it, if you were to compress the film into a single frame, then that frame would be mostly black and white), the fashion, the typewriter that Freeman's character uses, the taxis, the rain, the smog, the is-it-New-York-or-Chicago-nameless-city, the well-spoken and well-read central protagonist & antagonist, the endless references (atypical to noir and pulp) to literature such as 'Dante's Inferno' But this doesn't come across as some new and profound take on it - as say Tarantino (Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs) or the Coenn Brothers (The Big Lebowski, Fargo) managed to do at a similar time, but it just comes across as a constant rehash of lamentable pulp and noir tropes that we've all seen before. It doesn't come across as engaging, entertaining, though provoking or cool - it's boring.Seek out films such as 'The Missing Person' or 'Brick' for a much more engaging take on neo-noir.",1,20,42,25 March 2013
