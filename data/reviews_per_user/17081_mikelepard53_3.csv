The Perks of Being a Wallflower," The Perks of Being a Pushover
","Wow. This movie is terrible. They are acting like this is how every teenagers life is like. I am a teenager and I cannot relate to this movie one bit. I hated it. The main character is such a pushover. His 'friends' tell him to drugs, and he just does it. Because he just wants to fit in. His guy best friend kisses him and he just acts like it's fine, but it's not. The main character is not gay, so another boy does not need to be kissing him. I hate this movie, and I always will. It is garbage. Do not watch this. It's a waste of your time. If you like this movie, you are wrong. Because there's no way that this movie could be considered good.",1,14,41,10 April 2015
Drive," Drive...A Modern American Classic
","Woah...Nicolas Winding Refn is now one of my favorite directors. What he did with this movie is absolutely incredible. This movie is my favorite example of what I call style over substance. The music, clothes, dialogue (or lack there of), and the cars are all so beautiful and stylish. I feel like I could watch this movie everyday for the rest of my life and be perfectly happy with that. People complain that with Ryan Gosling's quiet roles that he's not really a good actor, but I think that he and Carey Mulligan decided to use little dialogue together was such a good idea. You can really, truly see Gosling's emotions flow through this character. The Driver (Gosling) truly loves Irene (Mulligan), but her husband recently got out of prison, so it is kind of an awkward situation. Through a series of events of crime and corruption, the Driver ends up in a dangerous situation where he must continue to protect Irene from danger. But, in doing that, the Driver has to be quiet violent himself. He ends up stomping a man's head until he crushes his skull and brains, which some people think was unnecessary for the movie, but I thought that it fit perfectly. Refn is a filmmaking genius and I have no complaints about this movie. I would recommend it to anyone and hope that everyone enjoys it as much as I have. 10 out of 10 would recommend",10,1,3,28 August 2015
The Dark Knight," The Dark Knight, More Like The Awesome Movie!!!
","This movie is wonderful from start to finish. From the opening scene with The Joker and his henchmen robbing the bank, to Batman taking the fall for Harvey Dent's crimes at the end of the film, this film will grab your attention and keep it. This may be the darkest superhero film out there, but that is not a bad thing. In fact, I like it that way because it is more realistic. It is especially more realistic when you compare it to films like The Avengers. In that film, nothing truly bad really happens. It all is too happy and cheerful. But, in The Dark Knight, many bad things do happen that cannot be fixed. Rachel Dawes dies. And there is no bringing her back. Harvey Dent turns to the dark side, kills people, and dies himself. There's no bringing him back. The police hate Batman and are hunting him. They consider him a criminal. This is not your typical superhero movie, but I can promise you that it will be one of your favorites.",10,0,4,16 October 2014
