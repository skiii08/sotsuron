The Mask," It's the wackiest movie on earth--great family fun!
","I encourage everyone with a sense of humor to pull up a chair and watch this movie--again and again!If you don't laugh at this movie, you must be legally dead--or need to have your funny bone surgically replaced.This movie has everything--except it really needs a bit more naughty language and a booby or two (they usually come in twos).",Null,0,1,23 February 2004
