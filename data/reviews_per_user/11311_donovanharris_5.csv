The New World," The new world review
","To begin, I was watching this movie to learn about the different types of ways of film making and learning about how different things were during the 1600's. This was also around the time where the English took over the Natives. The plot of this movie starts off on an island in the middle of the ocean where most Natives had stayed and lived in harmony until the English men showed and without an invitation. At first, the Natives seen the English men as a threat but then later on in the movie, both sides learn to work together. This also includes the many journeys and obstacles the English men had to go through in order to get to the island and still be able to maintain food and water. Towards the end of the movie, viewers can start to point out that the bond between the Natives and the English men starts to separate which then makes the Natives see the men as a threat to their culture and civilization. Since this movie was based on the 1600's, and 1700's age period, the special effects and the way everything is set up, it is very different than what it is like today. For example, the castles and the clothing types that people would wear is also very different along with the men style as well. Another thing to point out is that the society is living in a monarchy which means they almost always need a leader, or someone who is in control. In my opinion, there wasn't that many aspects of the historical accuracy that really needed to be pointed out. Yes, history can be rewritten but in this story everything seems to fall in place correctly based on the Disney series movie Pocahontas.",3,0,0,30 August 2018
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Review
","This movie was very interesting and had lots of action which was good to keep the story exciting. Although most of the movie took place in South America, it was cool to see different aspects of time especially during the time this movie was made as it's seen as an older movie. The leadership roles were portrayed very strong for the characters so the 'mission' and fights the men needed to go through, they could with the right people. Overall this was a good older action movie that used violence in good forms of the story.",3,0,7,26 November 2018
The Alamo," Alamo review
","This movie had a very interesting beginning and and plot to go along with the story. Alamo was built to protect the lives of many and a war built type of community. The battles and and plans that were made were very interesting to see as how the spanish acted and took force. They were seemed as powerful mostly because of all the groups of soldiers that they had. Basically the whole movie was about executing and moving on from place to place finding the next threat that came to face. There was a lot of integrity involved that is admired but the special effects could use a bit more help. Overall, the courage and and independence throughout the movie was outstanding and the lesson learned about always fighting and never giving up. It was indeed a powerful story.",5,0,3,15 October 2018
Wonder Woman," Wonder Woman Review
","Wonder Woman was a great movie that has a historical background based on Greek mythology. This was also a time where word war 1 was going which was also were said 'Aries' is controlling the mind of the soldiers and making them go corrupt. Her homeland, Themescura was were other women like her would train and learn the ways of the other great leaders of the goddesses. In the movie it was said that these goddesses were created to keep the gods from going corrupt which was wrong, they were treated as slaves so they fought for freedom. Overall the main message of this story is really self sacrifice and to never give up hope.",10,3,4,26 November 2018
Cinderella Man," Cinderella Man Review
","The cinderella man may seem confusing because of the name, but it's a one of a kind boxing story about second chances and succeeding. This movie had a powerful beginning and end that had lots of interesting conflicts and action added into the story. 2 of the main fighters both from different social classes agree to fight in a big match to see who's the overall best boxer. One man fights for family and love and one for fame and money. Throughout the story you can kinda see how far that gets the man in the higher class. Overall this was a great movie that showed a powerful message about never getting up and to take the most out of second chances.",9,1,1,4 December 2018
