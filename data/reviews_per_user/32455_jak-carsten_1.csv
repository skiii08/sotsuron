Sucker Punch," You will be VERY disappointed
","Whoever wrote that movie should stop writing movies and just stick with flipping burgers and asking people if they would like that super-sized.They take you through these crazy epic adventures(which have nothing to do with the plot) and at the end of the movie you find out it's all in her head (the whole plot of the movie, that is). They literally end it with 'and then she woke up...and got lobotomized'. WTF??The writing is BELOW a third grade level. However, it does provide a unique experience...this will be probably the only time you send $1 on a redbox movie and feel like you got ripped off. The price of this movie should be FREE.",1,10,18,16 October 2011
