Hereditary," Seriously a waste of time
","I really try watching this movie, I was wondering why the high score even though there were so many bad critics, and seriously I get tonyevboijt where I couldn't even stand to watch the movie anymore. The acting is poor, the scenes are overlong and after 1:30:00 you haven't seen anything that would scare you. Seriously this is a waste of time",1,2,6,4 September 2018
Transformers," So freaking boring!
","I tried to re-watch this movie since I've never been a big fan of Michale Bay's transformers however after watching the new bumblebee movie I thought maybe I'm being too harsh with the old transformer movies. Literally I wasted one hour trying to connect with this old franchise I realize that this freaking movie doesn't have anything interesting and it's so freaking lame the only thing cool about it it's the robots however All that unnecessary story on Qatar, The sector seven stupid agent makes the movie super boring, This movie is not even recommend it if you don't have anything else to watch",4,0,1,16 April 2019
