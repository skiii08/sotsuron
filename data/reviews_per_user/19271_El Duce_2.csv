The Blair Witch Project," Neo-'Horror' Fans Won't Understand
","If you love Scream, I know what you did last Summer, Urban Legend, Carrie 2 and Bride of Chucky and have never seen true horror movies like Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Exorcist, Evil Dead, Maniac, Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer and Night of the Living Dead then you might not like TBWP.See, you need to understand 'originality'.  It takes an open-mind and common sense to do so.  Most mainstream trend followers have neither of those.  It saddens me.The Blair Witch Project is a scary movie.  It scares, period.  I got in my bed that night and started thinking about the ending.  I got chills.  I got chills the next day at work thinking about it!  That is the first movie from the '90's that has done that to me.Basic 'Scream Fan' Complaints: 'I never got to see the monster' 'Where was the blood?' 'I didn't get the ending' 'Why were there all those long, dark scenes?' 'Where was Neve Campbell and Usher?' 'That sucked.  Let's go rent The Faculty!'You will not see any tag-teaming, ghost masked wearing teenagers.  You will not see a big, immortal fisherman with a hook on his hand.  You will not see a curly-haired Revlon model brutally murdering her college classmates.  What you will see is a truly original movie.  If your brain allows you to understand, you will enjoy it",Null,0,0,4 August 1999
Any Given Sunday," Waste of Film
","Unlike 'The Program' and 'Varsity Blues', 'Any Given Sunday' did not portray modern day football at all.  It was far too long and the 'live' football shots were not real at all.  I play football and that is not at all what you see, if it was then the offenses would constantly be at a stand still at the 50 yards line. Overall this movie was very disappointing and I am a huge football and movie fan so I was extra disappointed.  Save your money at the theatre and at the movie store!",Null,0,0,21 February 2000
