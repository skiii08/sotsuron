Skyfall," Uneven (6.5)
","My take on Skyfall is that while it has several truly iconic/beautiful cinematic moments, the plot is rather contrived in many places, and it feels somewhat uneven overall. So while it definitely is not bad, it is not all that great either.Pros: The cast. Javier Bardem plays a very memorable, scene stealing villain, believably psychotic. I was pleasantly surprised to see Ben Winshaw (Bright Eyes) as Q. Some nice moments between Bond and M. The opening sequence is pretty good. The Shanghai building sequence and the nighttime Skyfall sequence are both wonderful cinematic stylizations, either of which could respectively house a great film. Adele is a nice choice to sing the theme song.Cons: The theme song sequence is like a directing/editing identity crisis, rotating between beautiful, corny and so on. Several of the different settings feel like they came out of different films. Yes, I can make leaps, but it just seems that the whole is a bit noncohesive. And lastly, the plot at times feels like it goes the way it does not naturally, but just because it has to in order to set up whatever is coming next. Overall, I have seen worse, and I have seen better. Meh.",7,2,6,18 November 2012
Star Trek Into Darkness," Fun Action Film, Bad Star Trek Film
","With Star Trek Into Darkness, there is quite a divide between those who enjoy it for its entertainment value, and those who despise it for its abandonment of classic Star Trek principles. Honestly, I can relate to both camps. It simply comes down to what one values as a viewer, and it should not be difficult to understand those with opposing perspectives. That being said, when viewed as part of the Star Trek franchise, this film is very much a disappointment.What Stark Trek Into Darkness has going for it is that it is an exciting, fast-paced, visually attractive action film with a great cast. It is easy to watch and beautiful to look at. One must admit that some of the Star Trek films of the past, whatever their virtues may have been, were extremely boring. That is no longer the case, and in and of itself, the engaging style of these new films is not a bad thing. The franchise needed to be refreshed, and made more accessible to general audiences. The problem with STID is that the story itself has been give the lowest of all priorities, and that is why it is not a good Star Trek film.The opening sequence serves as a microcosm of the larger film. It is comprised of a series of narratively-nonsensical set-pieces that exist for no other reason than to look cool. And they do look cool, no argument there. But something like the Enterprise 'hiding' underwater is just purely ludicrous. Yes, we get a fantastic visual of a starship rising from the ocean, but it makes not a lick of sense either within the science of the Star Trek universe, or within the story line at hand. Not every viewer will be bothered by such things, of course, but it should be simple enough to acknowledge the issue.From there, the story unfolds more or less accordingly, with pseudoscientific (within Star Trek) plot twists holding together a narrative that is deeply conflicted. The conflict is between the good story idea that begins with Benedict Cumberbatch's character's introduction and ends with the same character's destruction. Somewhere within the murky husk of Star Trek Into Darkness is a good film about terrorism, militarization and the end of innocence. Unfortunately, the film's defining characteristic is its ill-advised homage to a set of classic scenes from another, much better Star Trek film that was made thirty years ago.John Harrison is a good new character. The idea that he is actually Khan Noonien Singh does not make sense. It is completely contrived. However, the greater problem is the winking recycling of what is arguably the most iconic scene from the most iconic film in the franchise, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. From my subjective standpoint, it is offensively ill-conceived, not to mention poorly executed. A small moment in a long film, perhaps, but for this longtime Star Trek fan, an exceedingly hard pill to swallow.Again, from the perspective of someone who is simply looking for an exciting space action film, none of that may matter. There have been Star Trek films that were bad films, period. This one is not a bad film; it is just a bad Star Trek film. This franchise, as other reviewers have noted, is supposed to be about thoughtful commentary on society (which requires a well-written story) and exploration of new frontiers (which requires a plot that is not focused on making nods to the past).To suggest, as the front-page user review here in IMDb does, that one should 'ignore the critics,' is to over-simplify the situation here. By all means, do not let anyone else's subjective opinion dampen your enjoyment of something. But by the same token, try to understand that Star Trek is a deeply meaningful thing to many people, and that this film sacrifices much of its core attributes in order to be more accessible to the average viewer.The tragedy is that there is no reason why a Star Trek film cannot be both thoughtful and exciting, well-written and visually stimulating. It simply takes the right people being involved in the production. I do not want another Star Trek Into Darkness, but neither do I want another Star Trek: Insurrection. There can be a balance, and hopefully in the future, there will be a film that finds it.",4,3,6,6 December 2014
Batman Returns," Stylistically intoxicating, if you can get by the intense darkness.
","Basically, the downside of this film, to me, is how dark and depressing (and at times, disgusting) it is. This is one of those examples where whatever shortcomings the story and/or character development may have, it is nevertheless an addictively compelling work of visual art, and it works on that level alone. The plot is not bad, but it is not really what drives Batman Returns. The cast is very good, I think. Keaton is IMO underrated as Batman, DeVito and Pfieffer convincingly portray twisted criminal insanity, and Walken is crucial in giving the film a greater level of complexity.Again, the visual look is a wonderland of Tim Burton-isms. The icy winter setting, whimsical penguin commandos and circus crime gang, incredibly cool Batmobile and Batmissle vehicle sequences...there are just so many things to capture the imagination.The problem, of course, and it is a significant problem, is how dark this film is. It is scary, violent, sometimes gross, and ultimately depressing. Batman should be dark and thought-provoking, but this one reaches prohibitive degrees of darkness. It is definitely not appropriate for family/children, and arguably may not really have much redeeming value for adults, either. (The whole issue of which was kind of responsible for the much different excesses of the Joel Schumacher films.) Batman Returns is like one of those really weird paintings that may qualify as works of genius art, but which may not be worth looking at, just the same.",7,1,5,7 July 2012
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," A Disappointing, Clumsy Mess of a Film
","Well, where to begin? I am not even sure what to say, but I know how I feel about this film. For one thing, the title is not very artistically conceived, and I consider that a retrospective harbinger to the issues present in the film itself. After the interesting opening scene, the entire 'let us now recap decades of story action in one montage' begins the trend of trying to tell far too much story far too quickly, without regard for finesse. Telling a good story is often helped by limiting the scope, allowing more time to really look at the characters and get inside their minds.The whole 'look' of the film is very 'glossed over,' with a certain sort of sheen to it that I find nauseating (similar to Lord of the Rings, but much worse here). Perhaps that is a technique to help the visual effects blend in, but to me it just makes all of it look fake. And then there are sequences such as the one in which Wolverine flies through the air, slicing through helicopter blades with his claws. Now, I know that adamantium is the stuff, but come on. That is bending reality too far, and I could not suspend my disbelief to accommodate it.There are lots of characters, and while the cast and acting are all pretty good, the story is what trips them up. Gambit is unsatisfying. Stryker seems pretty vanilla compared to his portrayal in X2, but that may be excused since he is younger here. I am not an X-Men know-it-all, but the whole film just feels to me like a mess of far too many elements being thrown together in hopes of something good emerging. Who was editing this film? I assume that time constraints were in play.The one thing that I think is truly great about this film is the brief segment in rustic Canada, where Logan/Wolverine is working as a lumberjack and spending quiet moments with Lynn Collins' character (Silverfox?). There are some absolutely beautiful scenes, in particular the one at night where she tells him the Native American lore about the moon...and the Wolverine. They could have made a *great* film by focusing on that aspect of his backstory, but instead decided to cram nearly a century of time, tons of peripheral characters, and a relentless barrage of often ridiculous action sequences in a couple of hours. Sigh. I cannot recommend this as a good film. For an X-fan, it is of interest in the same way as Star Wars Episode I is of interest to classic a Star Wars fan...For the record: (X-Men 9/10) (X2 10/10) (The Last Stand 4.5/10) (First Class 9/10)",2,1,2,5 December 2012
About Time," The Beauty & Sentiment Win Out
","For me, there is no getting around the fact that it just feels wrong for Rachel McAdams to be in a film so undeniably similar to her previous film The Time Traveler's Wife. That just is what it is.However, even though it feels a bit derivative in plot and pushes the bounds of even time-travel logic here and there, this film gets at least a 7.5-8.0 rating from me on the strength of the story that is being told, and what a purely beautiful takeaway it gives.It is not really about time travel. It is about relationships, but not in a saccharine, run-of-the-mill way. McAdams is unbelievably cute of course, but Domhnall Gleeson is absolutely brilliant as the lead character and the entire cast is superb.I wont' drone on...About Time is one of the sweetest, mostly beautiful, most inspiring films that I have seen in a long time. It does not take its high-concept premise too seriously (which is a good thing) but it takes the characters and their humanity and their connections to each other very seriously ( which is to say that it has real emotional weight - also a very good thing). Better than it looks like it will be from a distance, just tearfully gorgeous up close, and thus it gets my recommendation.",8,2,5,20 November 2013
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Epic and Entertaining in Spite of Flaws (7.5)
","RETURN OF THE JEDI was my favorite Star Wars film as a child. From an adult perspective, I find it a bit flawed and frustrating in some ways, but that should not take away from the many fantastic elements at work, and the very satisfying high that it ends on.The biggest issue is the light, sometimes throwaway silly tone that is present in parts of the film. There is a little of that in the Jabba's Palace sequence that makes up the front end of the story, but of course it is the Ewoks who are the prime expression. It is my understanding that early drafts of the story called for Wookies to be utilized instead of Ewoks. That would have made logical sense, given Chewbacca a great emotional anchor and made for fantastic storytelling. However, the more cuddly, teddy-bear-like Ewoks were created, and the sight of them taking on Imperial Stormtroopers, while frequently entertaining and humorous and a well-meaning metaphor, is just silly. It takes away from the dramatic tension that was built up in THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK.Beyond that, ROTJ also just feels kind of uneven overall, as though it is several separate films spliced together. But don't get me wrong, a lot of it is really great. Jabba's Palace is exotic and intriguing, the speeder bike chase through the forests of Endor is classic, and it is nice to see more of how the Rebel Alliance is made up of so many alien races, all pulling together for the common ideal of freedom.There are at least two things about ROTJ that are absolutely fantastic. One is the space battle around the second Death Star in orbit over Endor. As a special effects sequence, this is still mind-blowing 30 years later. There will almost certainly never be another model-based orchestration like this. I shudder to imagine how much work went into creating the dizzying ballet of starfighters and warships spinning through the void of space in a hailstorm of laser bolts. Incredible.The other incredible part is Luke Skywalker's final, climactic confrontation with Darth Vader and the Emperor. As others have noted, it's not as much an action sequence as the Luke-Vader duel in TESB, but rather a psychological crucible. John William's haunting musical score is perfect for the dark, emotionally apocalyptic setting. It is a very powerful character-development setpiece for Luke.Regarding the 'changes' made by George Lucas for the 1997 Special Edition and the 2004 Special-er Edition, I find them almost universally horrible. The new Jabba's Palace dance sequence is painful to watch, not to mention hideously cheap looking CGI. I will always take costumes, makeup and animatronics over CGI in these sorts of instances. And of course, the ending where Hayden Christensen replaces Sebastian Shaw as Anakin Skywalker (while Alec Guiness is *not* replaced by Ewan McGregor) is just plain puzzling. What was George Lucas thinking?Overall, RETURN OF THE JEDI - the ORIGINAL 1983 THEATRICAL VERSION - is a wonderfully entertaining conclusion to the original STAR WARS trilogy. It's a great film for kids, and while my adult self really wishes that the story had been written more seriously, it is nevertheless a captivating creation and very enjoyable.",7,1,3,15 January 2013
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Strongest Marvel Studios Film to Date
","This is the most serious, fully-realized, across-the-board result that Marvel Studios has produced thus far, in my opinion. While it may not be quite as big, or have quite the flashy lineup of superhero characters as The Avengers, CA: The Winter Soldier is clearly a better film.Good, real-world relevant story, excellent visuals, thrilling (really thrilling) action. Terrific ensemble cast. Robert Redford, Emily VanCamp and Anthony Mackie are all wonderful additions. Redford especially lends a crucial weight of charisma.This is really a SHIELD movie, and it does a great job of both building and breaking the backbone of these Avengers-related films. It also provides a great series of question-mark setups for the future of this saga.As far as weaknesses, I found the humor to be a bit flat in several cases. Other than that, though, pretty solid overall.Once you accept that this genre (superhero) is all about painting with broad strokes -- meaning relatively simple plot structures, archetypal characters and emphasis on visual impressions -- this film can be given credit for being remarkably mature and literate. A good sign for the future of the Marvel Studios machine.",8,1,2,9 April 2014
Life of Pi," Beautiful, Unusual, Strange Aftertaste
","I am not completely sure what to think of Life of Pi. Certainly, the majority of my thoughts equal a thumbs up. But when all said and done, it seemed...hard to pin down.Pros: Almost everything; Directing, writing, casting, acting, music, cinematography, and most especially incredible, unique visual imagery and artistically gratifying use of 3D.Cons: There is long one shot scene near the end that felt like it scrubbed a lot of the story's momentum, and put more questions in my mind as to what was really supposed to have been going on. That may be the intended effect, but I found it more confusing than intriguing or thought-provoking. Also, like several other films that I have seen this year, the 'main idea' is not nearly as well fleshed-out as it aims to be. What is this story really about?Overall: Life of Pi contains some of the most gorgeous, overwhelmingly magical, otherworldy visuals that I have ever seen, and it is the first time that I have enjoyed watching a film with 3D glasses on. (All others that I have seen in 3D, which granted did not include Avatar, struck me as cheap, artistically bankrupt gimmicks - but not this one.) It is worth the price of admission for that alone. And there are plenty of other reasons to see it, which I will not spoil. Ang Lee is, for my money, one of the best directors out there, and this film most definitely does not fall into any 'lowest common denominator' category. It is something special.Is it a masterpiece as a whole? I am not willing to go quite that far. Avatar has a more concise story, and that counts a great deal to me. However, Life of Pi is arguably the more genuinely intriguing of the two. I would recommend it.",8,1,3,25 November 2012
Ant-Man," The Ant-i Ultron
","Ant-Man is a welcome respite from the overdriven, mile-a-minute spectacle that the average action film has become. In this movie, dialogue is often relaxed, musical cues generally subtle and the scale far more intimate. Not just small in size--heh, heh--but in terms of spending more time with characters doing normal-people things. Sure, there is high concept science-fiction and the usual corporate mustache- twirling, but those elements are tempered by an overall 'relaxed' feeling. Great cast, wonderfully inspired visuals, and a different sense of humor. If Age of Ultron (or Transformers, etc) made your brain feel like a chia-pet with sensory overload, give this one a try. It's not great, but it is good, and it's different in a good way.EDIT: Since first posting this, I have noticed a pattern in the reviews at large. Once again--I've seen it before--the majority of the reviews for Ant-Man are positive, but most of them have been voted not- useful, often receiving '0 out of however many' upvotes. So essentially, users who liked this film are taking the time to say a few words about it, and users who either disliked it or simply dislike the positive reviews are downvoting those reviews. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the internet.",7,0,8,24 July 2015
Captain America: The First Avenger," A Nice Film, Considering How Many Hats It Wears
","I am a fan of the character and really wanted and expected this film to be good. Initially, I was disappointed, but subsequent viewings have greatly improved my opinion. I have enjoyed Captain America: The First Avenger more each time that I have watched it, which I think speaks well for the film. It clearly is not perfect, but in my opinion is not deserving of some of the very harsh reviews that others have given.First of all, CA:TFA suffers from being used as the most overt prequel to The Avengers. An ideal Captain America film would not be so concerned with setting up another film. The tessarect plot angle is the most obvious element in this regard - such 'cosmic' themes do not come to mind when one first pictures Captain America. However, when you accept the franchise-building role as part of the package, this film is not a bad effort, and really quite likable.The Good - Chris Evan is very well cast in the lead role, earnest and believable. The score is inspiring and nostalgic. Most of the supporting cast members work well, particularly Stanley Tucci, Hayley Atwell, Tommy Lee Jones, Toby Jones and Dominic Cooper (as a Howard Hughes-inspired Howard Stark). The retro-40s aesthetic design work is generally enjoyable to see. Some of the 'vintage sci-fi' HYDRA technology is very gee-whiz cool-looking. The story has a lot heart, even if it is stretched thin.The Not So Good - Visually, there is a lot of faux-3D feel when viewed in 2D, the fakeness of which unfortunately undermines what should be a more rustic WWII aesthetic (not nearly as bad as other weird-looking films like Warhorse and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, though). Sebastian Stan as Bucky is utterly forgettable and uninteresting. The Red Skull could have been a bit more gritty (and realistic) and truly menacing. The pacing is somewhat uneven.Regardless of what you may think of Joe Johnston, I feel that he was a good choice to direct this film. CA:TFA is actually very, very similar to Johnston's earlier film The Rocketeer, and there are some shared virtues with October Sky as well. Again, I enjoy and appreciate this film more each time I watch it, absorb more of its lovingly-crafted details and come away each time feeling inspired and with a smile on my face. It could have been better, but like most of Marvel Studios' productions, CA:TFA is a worthwhile adaption that treats its subject with sensitivity. I find it compelling enough to give it at least 7.5 out of 10.",7,1,4,29 September 2013
American Hustle," Mediocre as a Whole, in Spite of Fragments of Brilliance (6.5)
","This may be a case where heightened expectations play a factor, but I found American Hustle disappointing. The narrative feels kind of obtuse/unfocused/sloppy...pick a word. It just seems disoriented, and not in a deliberate, effective way. So a lot of flash and interesting shots, but not a very sharp-feeling overall effect.The Good - Christian Bale. Amy Adams. Christian Bale. Nice 70s aesthetic in the look, feel and sound of the film. Christian Bale. This is the first time that I have truly enjoyed Jeremy Renner in a film (I still do not buy into the 'star hype' with him, but this is a good, affecting performance). The humor, while spotty, comes through very well here and there. Did I mention that Christian Bale is superb in this? Man.The Not So Good - The combination of directing, writing, scoring and editing muddies the narrative unnecessarily. This film could have been better if those aforementioned things had been conducted more sharply and cohesively in concert with each other. But hey, maybe the way it is is absolutely intentional on David Russell's part. If so, then it is just not to my tastes. I found Bradley Cooper's character to be unremarkable and lacking in genuine punch, and Jennifer Lawrence's performance to be awkward and unconvincing for the most part.The Takeaway - This film is okay. But the trailer had me expecting something dazzling, something great. Make no mistake, there is some serious spark from Bale and Adams, and a heavy dose of 70s aesthetic. But more than anything else, this is a lesson in how you cannot always trust the hype machine to deliver on its buildup (or other reviewers, for that matter).",6,20,37,28 December 2013
Ender's Game," A Remarkably Well-Done Adaption
","Overall, I am really impressed with how well-executed this film is. It takes the source material, streamlines it, and maintains the focus of the story with brisk pacing, great design and excellent acting. Could it have been better? A little, but mostly, it could have been A LOT worse. As it is, Ender's Game is one of the better recent sci-fi films in its own right, and succeeds in being a thoughtful, meaningful film, not just action or special effects.The story is tweaked in a few ways, and some of it is cut out. But in my personal opinion, most of the changes have been the right ones in the interest of translating the story to film.The visual design and effects are great, and the music works well. It is the acting, though, that is the key. Asa Butterfield is superb in the lead role, and the rest of the main cast is about as good as one could dream of having for a film like this. The script is a bit low on finesse a lot of the time, but it works because it is economical and straightforward. This story has a lot of psychological and ethical currents, and amazingly, it succeeds in translating the crucial ones.Oddly enough, the one part that I feel to be a bit clumsy is the key moment. I will not spoil it, though.Finally, I feel compelled to make a comparison between this film and Peter Jackson's The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. Both are based on classic, fairly short and quick-reading novels. But whereas The Hobbit takes a simple, easy-to-adapt story, bloats it with unnecessary additions and stretches it out ad nauseam (my personal opinion), Ender's Game takes an arguably difficult-to-adapt story and (also in my personal opinion) pretty much nails it with economy and effective brevity. What a breath of fresh air, for a change.Ultimately, I feel that this is just about the best adaption that could have been hoped for, which is to say that it does justice to the book while being a good film in and of itself.",Null,2,5,2 November 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man," Great potential, but not very well-executed...
","In spite of several very good individual elements, Amazing Spider-Man falls short as a whole. The good includes a beautiful, more modern aesthetic (compared to the previous Spider-Man films), a for the most part very good cast, and an admirable effort to build more technical/'realistic' explanation into the back story. That being said, to me it fails as a reboot because far too much of it feels both highly derivative of, and sadly inferior to, last decade's Spider-Man 1 and 2. When rebooting a franchise, the last thing that you want the audience to be thinking as they watch the film is, 'this is really a lot like the other version, but not really as good.' That thought went through my mind multiple times. The other problem, which is sort of the same problem, is that the villain was just not convincing. Too clichéd, again too derivative of both Green Goblin and Dr. Octopus, without being nearly as well fleshed out or understandable, and thus not nearly as truly menacing. Also, the villain's form, literally, did not make sense. I will not spoil that, but the character's visual design is incongruous, which make him harder to buy into. The exposition was lacking in some other key areas, as well. I will say that the cast was terrific, in particular Emma Stone, Sally Field and Martin Sheen, in addition to Andy Garfield. It is saying something that they fully atone for the absence of the much-beloved Toby and Kirsten. The Spidey costume is awesome as well. The problem is that this is not as good as Spider-Man 1 or 2 were as fully-formed films.",6,3,7,6 July 2012
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Richly Rewarding
","I am extremely pleased with what Fox has done with this franchise, starting with X-Men: First Class, through The Wolverine and now this film. Redemption and moving back in the right direction, towards what it was in the beginning. This one is a tremendous experience, a culmination of a decade and a half of character development and social and emotional themes. Days of Future Past is a very powerful story that is both vast and intimate.Without droning on, the story is a classic, spanning decades and incorporating some historical fiction with futuristic science fiction. But the characters are at the core, and this is such a brilliant, incredible group of actors. McAvoy, Lawrence, Jackman, Fassbender, Stewart, McKellan, Dinklage...the list just goes on. And there are some great performances in this film. Some incredibly moving moments.Visually, it's jaw-droppingly rendered, from the 1970s past to the dark future. There are so many different types of scenes and looks. In a way, this is like the Cloud Atlas of X-Men movies, and I mean that in the best way possible. (This is far easier to keep track of than Cloud Atlas, rest assured of that, but they share a similarity in different groups of people in different times and places all being tied into the same theme.)Why do I not give it a perfect ten out of ten? Well, there were a few small things that I think could have been improved, such as a line of dialog here or something else there. Also, the climactic scene contained something that I can only make sense of as a 'let's include a huge visual effect' move. But any complaints are just drops in the ocean, really.Overall, this is an incredible thing. The amount of resources involved here is astounding. And fortunately, it works. This film is what it was meant to be, an ultimate-level storyline that is breathtaking in scope without losing the personal character moments that make it all worthwhile and give it its real power. There will surely be more X-Men films to come, but for now, this is a very fitting, heartswelling way to take fourteen years and six previous films' worth of universe-building and bring it all back around in a most satisfying way. Highly, highly, highly recommended.",9,0,0,23 May 2014
Captain America: Civil War," This One Owns the Hype
","Long story short, Civil War delivers on expectations in a way that one might be hesitant to hope for. It's basically everything that it needs to be, and those are a lot of things. Wrapping up the excellent Captain America trilogy with heart and integrity; evolving the Avengers as a team; and introducing new characters Black Panther and Spider-Man in ways that build momentum and interest for their own respective, upcoming films.This is one of the most packed, busy films that I have ever watched, so much so that it could be a point of criticism if it wasn't handled so well, if the many parallel stories weren't woven together with such grace and sensitivity. Terrific job by the writers, directors and editors. This is how it's done, and even though it is a Captain America film, it's also the best Avengers film yet.Action, humor, philosophical discussions about superheroing, tension, emotion, it's all here. I might not be disposed to hand out a perfect ten/ten score, but really I emerged from this screening satisfied by the experience and energized for the next one. It's beating a dead horse to say so, but a certain other big film this year failed hard to elicit those two things in me. Civil War, on the other hand, gets it done with style and substance. Very good stuff.",9,10,20,7 May 2016
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Restraint? Who Needs That?
","First of all, The Desolation of Smaug is far more watchable than An Unexpected Journey. Why? Because there is enough content (plot developments, action) to actually fill up the lengthy running time. And that is no surprise, as this installment represents the most substantive part of the source material.As many others have mentioned, this is still best accurately described as 'a film inspired by the Hobbit' than a straight adaption of the book itself. And there are still some issues that I have with it. But at least I did not feel like I had wasted my money in going to see this one.The Good - The cast is almost uniformly wonderful, both old and new. Martin Freeman is perfect as Bilbo, although unfortunately he gets a bit lost in the myriad of other story lines here. Of the newcomers, Evangeline Lilly (Tauriel) and Luke Wilson (Bard) stand out to me. And Mikael Persbrandt does an excellent job with his very brief screen time as Beorn (his scene easily being one of my favorite parts of this film). The outdoor cinematography is lovely, as we've come to expect. And of course Smaug himself is, if you'll pardon my choice of words, freaking fantastic, both in appearance and voice. That is key, because this story is really all about the dragon. Or at least it should be.The Not So Good - The action sequences are exercises in numbing excess. Physically unrealistic, overly long, and looking like video games due to unnecessary overuse of CGI. A bit of restraint could have made these scenes much more genuinely dramatic and realistic. The orcs, wargs and so forth are mostly CGI themselves, which just makes them look fake. There are some changes to the story that could have been done without. And I have never watched any films with more heavy-handed musical scoring than these first two Hobbit films. Occasionally, there is a moment of silence, and it is profoundly affecting because it helps build genuine suspense. They really should lay off on the grand/epic orchestral cues. Often, they come across feeling much more forced than natural.There are a couple of other things that I would mention, one good and one bad. To get the bad out of the way first, the character of Azog the Defiler adds very little if any value to these films and his quest to kill Thorin just takes away from the more important other story lines going on at the same time. Add to that the fact that he is an obviously CGI creation...I would edit Azog out of this film in a heartbeat.The other good thing is Evangeline Lilly's character, Tauriel. As much as I bemoan most of the changes to and additions to what is actually in the book, I love this new character. She's beautiful, brave, energetic, genuinely engaging and provides a nice counterpoint to all of the boys. Even though she is an elf, she brings a great deal of humanity to this film, as someone far more relatable than many of the other characters. Do some aspects of Tauriel strain the canon-credibility of this film? Maybe, but even as a bit of a Tolkien purist myself, I don't care. I love her.Overall, this film is decent. It has lots of action, a fairly brisk pace, some humor and even romance, and a spectacular realization of the most essential single thing about this story, Smaug. This is essentially supposed to be a story about a bunch of dwarfs trying to take back a mountain from a dragon. The films have added a bunch of other plot lines, which do distract a bit, but in the case of this film in particular, it all works out fairly well. I do not think that it will stand up to repeated viewings in the same way as the best films do, but it's a great ride in the theater. (Maybe a bit frightening for younger children, at some parts.)",7,1,3,6 January 2014
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," 7.5 - Pretty Good Film, Disappointing Adaption of Book
","I'll get this out of the way first: as a faithful adaption of the book, this fails. It misses the spirit of the printed Hobbit, attempting to graft on too many 'epic this!' Lord of the Rings moments. Also, the battle scenes are way too over the top. Also, etc. That all being said, if you can divorce your mind from the book (or if you've never read said book), it's a pretty good fantasy film.As usual, Peter Jackson brings the eye-popping production values in terms of breathtaking cinematography and rich prop and set design. The character dialogue is quite good. The casting was well done, especially for the characters of Thorin and Bilbo. Brilliant, those two. Gollum looks better than ever, and his perfectly executed big scene with Bilbo is unquestionably the highlight of the film.The musical score is familiar and beautiful, but gets overused to hammer home the emotional notes; in some cases it would have been better to just let the music drop out and have the acting convey the mood. The eagles looked rather fake during their first appearance, although they looked much better in the very next scene. The goblin scenes were way overdone; sometimes, being able to create digital characters and sets seems to lead directors into a bit of visual gluttony.I did not like some of the 'added' elements, but I have not really all of Tolkein's appendices (which were apparently mined for some of the story-expanding parts), so I can't say much about that. Also, I hate 3D. The film was blurry during camera pans, and the color was distinctly less appealing with the glasses on versus taking them off. All in all though, in spite of my quibbles, I have to admit that the Hobbit is a beautiful, exciting, humorous, epic specimen of a fantasy film. Credit where credit is due; there are many horrible films out there, and this one is pretty good.",7,4,10,27 December 2012
Avengers: Infinity War," Exceeds Expectations
","It's a blast when a film not only meets expectations, but exceeds them. This uses the whole toolkit that the Marvel films have accumulated over the years, and finds exactly the right mix of familiar and new, humor and drama. It's like a runaway freight train but it knows that and does nothing to take away from the rush of being on board. Great stuff.As far as specifics, the new combinations of characters are a joy, it's confident and intrepid visually and the rationale of why the villain is doing what he does comes across better than one would expect. There are a couple of scenes that seem contrived to push a lever for the story, but in such a grand scheme, hardly worth mentioning. This is far better than Age of Ultron, a real return to form for the Avengers.",9,4,13,28 April 2018
Frozen," Great Visuals, Unremarkable Script
","First of all, I strongly disagree with any assertions that Frozen hearkens back to the great Disney films of the late 80s and early 90s. The music is nowhere near that level, and the storytelling is not nearly as sharp. Even suggesting that this is the best *since* The Lion King rings false with me. I have not seen every Disney film of the past twenty years, but offhand I can say that Tangled, Bolt and Meet the Robinsons are all far superior examples well-written stories than Frozen. In my personal opinion, of course.Second of all, Frozen definitely skews towards the younger crowd, with little to none of the sophisticated touches or wittily mature humor that have come to be somewhat more commonplace in recent animated films. This one is aimed at the pre-teen crowd. Not that that is necessarily a bad thing, but it is worth noting.The overall story is an interesting one, but the execution is rather sloppy and the narrative meanders a bit too much. The dialog, in particular, is not a strength. Unlike the best films, in which every line and every scene feels both essential and perfect, Frozen is more of a loose joyride. Again, there is nothing inherently wrong with that approach, but in my personal estimation, it earns lower marks as a storytelling method.The songs are for the most part unremarkable, and some of the musical sequences suffer from not fully committing to dialog or singing. They just feel hastily-choreographed and not fully thought out. And do not even get me started on the troll song. Yikes.Two of the songs, 'Do You Want to Build a Snowman' and especially 'Let it Go,' do work very well. The latter ties into what is unquestionably the best scene in the film on every level. It provides the one glimpse of true majesty, the sort of quality that would explain all of the extremely positive 'this is the greatest' reviews that are being posted by others. Unfortunately, the film descends most of the way back into mediocrity after that scene.On the positive front, however, Frozen offers a fantastic, gorgeous take on the visual elements of winter. Deep blue ice, snowflakes, white mountains contrasting with colored skies. It is an unspeakably lovely display of a subject matter than CGI animation has never (in my experience) turned its energies to before, at least not like this. Of course, it goes without saying that all of the animation in Frozen, characters and landscapes alike, is excellent.For me, Tangled was much more satisfying than Frozen. I applaud Disney for honing their CGI skills, and for finally adapting The Snow Queen to screen. I just wish that they would have spent more time on the script.With films like this one, a distinction needs to be made between loving it for the visceral takeaway ('it was sweet'/'it had a great message'/'it made me feel good') and looking at it from a critical standpoint. Now, I understand that one needs to just 'forget about being critical' and enjoy a film - for me, the best films take care of that themselves. It is the ones, like Frozen, that seem like they clearly could have been much better, that get me thinking about just that.This film is a fun one for kids, and great to look at for adults, but it is far short of being great, or a masterpiece. More focus on an truly excellent story, and it might have been.",5,215,367,9 January 2014
Stardust," Strangely Stitched-Together
","I approach Stardust as someone who has not read the source material, so I do not have the benefit of being thrilled to see familiar characters brought to life on screen. For me, this is a very strangely distant, disjointed film. There are plenty of interesting ideas, clever lines and fantastic images, but the whole simply does not engage me.The problem, I think, is the directing. The angles, shots, editing; they do not assist the actors and visuals in connecting with the viewer (read: me). It feels like an anthology of scenes that are linked by story but not put together in such a way as to comprise a cohesive whole. As someone else said, it is 'episodic.' Perhaps that is how the book is, but if so, then I would question the wisdom in adapting such a structure. It feels like a classic example of something that is only the sum of its parts, not more.As someone who generally enjoys fantasy, is a big fan of Claire Danes and can appreciate a story that plays imaginatively with genre tropes, I expected to enjoy Stardust more. I suppose that to some extent, it just does not synchronize to my sense of aesthetic or sense of humor, the way that it does for other people.Ultimately, I think that this film is simply a matter of acquired taste. Many people find it tremendously engaging, beautiful, inspiring, romantic. I can see the shards of those things, but ultimately I find myself bored by how it is all put together. So in my estimation, Stardust is an interesting bit of cinema, worth watching once, but not one of the classics.",5,1,6,24 February 2015
Lincoln," Very Nicely Done
","The best thing about LINCOLN, to me, is how personal and intimate it is. Other than a few seconds at the very start, there are no active Civil War battles on screen, and the film does not try to be an exhaustive all-encompassing biography of Abraham Lincoln. Rather, it stays mostly in Washington D.C. and focuses on a brief, crucial block of time in history. I rather like Daniel Day-Lewis' performance; it's very nuanced, like the film built around it. The rest of the cast is quite good. I even enjoyed Tommy Lee Jones, whose manner I often find a bit exhausting. Very good screenplay and dialog. Some perfectly pitched and placed moments of humor. Personally, had I been the director, I would have ended it before the assassination, for a more even and fluid artistic conclusion. However, it's hard to fault much about this film. Spielberg adds yet another big line to his resume.",8,2,5,14 January 2013
Big Hero 6," Good, Not Great, Points for the Animation
","Context on perspective: I think that Frozen is way overrated, much prefer Tangled, and think that The Incredibles is the best Pixar film.Big Hero 6 has a lot going for it. Fantastic animation as expected, some inspired futuristic fusion design and an iconic new friend-type character and source of comedy in Baymax. I think that it is better than Frozen, if only because the story makes more sense and the setting is more interesting.Hiro is a good protagonist, but the film's focus kind of meanders. As someone mentioned in a review that I read elsewhere, there is a really good robotics-focused theme here, but as the plot plays out, that theme gets kind of buried under a business-as-usual villain- driven plot. Which is to say that BH6 doesn't manage the same sort of transcendence as the best animated films, the early Pixar installments in particular.That being said, there is a lot of eye-candy and inspired visual design to enjoy here, and for that reason alone, I think that there is appeal for older/adult viewers. The supporting characters really could have stood some more character development as they are an interesting group, but if nothing else, they'll make fun action figures.If you don't expect too much out of this one, it won't let you down. It's a good time, and hints at the potential of the computer animation medium to tackle truly expansive, futuristic material in the sci-fi vein.",7,0,16,14 November 2014
Brave," Beautiful looking but conceptually a bit messy...
","I do not think that Brave belongs on the list of transcendental, virtually perfect Pixar classics. Granted, it definitely contains some of the most beautiful computer animation that I have ever seen. Ten years ago, who would have thought that computer-generated hair could be so breathtakingly exciting? I love the hair (and fur) in Brave! But my problem with this movie is that it feels conceptually disjointed. Yes, the story is pretty easy to follow on a basic level, and yes, it is entertaining. The thing is that the main point/moral just comes across as forced, which means that, for me at least, all of the great individual elements do not add up to a greater whole. 'Brave' is a wonderful title, but the film itself struggles to bring it home by the time that the credits roll. Anyway, I guess that I was expecting more, or different.",6,1,3,29 June 2012
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Enjoyable Spectacle But Messy, Step Down
","My opinion is certainly no more valid than anyone else's but I think that most reviewers, especially the professional critics, have been far too generous towards this film. Like almost any blockbuster it is a lot of fun as pure spectacle, and like any Marvel Studios film it is full of details to delight fans. But as a film, it is a step down from the first Avengers and one of the weaker films in the series so far.The overall feeling is one of a rough draft. The visual effects in the opening sequence displayed some of the worst CGI integration that I have seen in a long time in a Marvel film, at least in 2D. Did they need more time to render the graphics? The dialogue could also have used a few more rounds of revision, as the jokes that landed in the previous film often failed to do so in this one. In a couple of instances, they were even in poor taste, very uncharacteristic. Prima Nocta? Really?It is easy to complain about too many characters, but really the issue here is too many stories. One can see all of the different angles, but a tighter focus and better editing could have improved the flow of the film as a whole. It sounds as though there was a lot of arguing between the director and the studio over what to include in the theatrical cut, and it shows in the end result.The single big letdown, however, is the villain Ultron. Long story short, the intense, chilling character in the advance trailers is not really present in the film. Instead, we get a poorly-realized villain throwing around witty one-liners like everyone else. This tonal approach undermines the effectiveness of the character. Age of Ultron needed to focus tightly on its titular antagonist, to make him an iconic foil. Ultimately, this film becomes another battle against a generic and faceless army. And there goes the chance to improve upon the first Avengers film. Very disappointing.All of that being said, this film is certainly worth the money to spend a couple of hours escaping into the world of these superheroes. The cast is once again excellent (aside from Jeremy Renner, who I have never connected with as Hawkeye) and the new characters are a lot of fun and bring a freshness that this franchise desperately needed. There is plenty of eye candy in terms of costumes and technology, and the Hulkbuster fight is truly fantastic.It will be interesting to see the rumored extended cut of this film. It may be quite a bit better than the theatrical version of this film, but I think that the latter could have been much better without any additional running time. This film, fun as it is, bears the hallmarks of a troubled production with a divided creative vision. It seems that the Marvel machine still has some kinks to work out. Recommended, but not as glowingly as one would hope to be able to.",6,2,6,7 May 2015
Hotel Transylvania," Nothing Special
","During the first 15-20 minutes or so, I was regretting this film, thinking that it was going to be an unbearably long couple of hours. There is a stretch where it is basically just a rapid fire sequence of cheap, uber-cliché monster/Halloween character jokes. A bunch of characters playing their stereotypes for all they are worth, and nothing more.Fortunately, things do pick up and there actually is a story. That was a relief for me. The last 2/3 of the film is fairly entertaining. Still obnoxious, and certainly not all that original, but entertaining. There is some emotional heart to it, and uh, yeah. The ending, as the plot is wrapped up and before the credits roll, is just over the top ridiculous, so much so that even the most cynical viewer probably cannot resist a smile. The credits themselves are fun, as well.Is Hotel Transylvania a 'good' film? I have a hard time going that far. Did it really need to be made, i.e. does it add anything of particular value to our cultural experience? Resounding 'No'. But is it really all that bad? No; it is fairly harmless, and like similar films, decent viewing for children, with a good message and lots of fun, bright colors. That is about it.",5,7,15,5 December 2012
Elysium," Mediocre
","For a sci-fi film, Elysium is neither beautiful, fun or brilliantly written. Rather, it attempts to be a socially-minded, emotionally-driven dystopian story with some action. The thing about making such a gritty sort of film is that the plot needs to be really tightly constructed. It does not have to be complex or high-concept - it can be tooth and nail simple - it just has to be seamlessly put together, whatever it is. Elysium has too shaky a script and too many contrived plot points to hit as hard as it needs to.It is not a horribly bad film (except for those turned off by a constant barrage of the F-word – for those viewers, this is a horrible film) but there is little attractive about it. And in spite of what seems on the surface like a surefire premise, it is not really emotionally or ethically compelling. It tries to be, tries quite overtly in fact, but it does not manage to get there.The Good – The visual effects, particularly the robots, aircraft and spacecraft. Sharlto Copley deliriously crazy, sadistic, over-the-top antagonist. Frankly, that is about it.The Bad – Lackluster script. Overly contrived plot. Matt Damon is a fine actor, but his understated persona does not help here. Underutilization of Jodie Foster. Failure to make the very obviously emotional beats truly sink in. Unconvincing ending.After viewing Elysium, I could not escape the feeling that this film, as it exists, does not really add much to the universe. It is more ambitious than Neil Blomkamp's previous effort District 9, but not as good. More effort, less to show for it. There are some clear (and unquestionably relevant) thematic elements related to immigration and human rights, but those issues deserve a stronger vehicle than Elysium provides. A rather mundane film overall.",6,2,4,30 August 2013
Total Recall," True Sci-Fi: Certifiably Crazy, with a Thoughtful Undercurrent
","All in all, this is really one of the strangest films out there, in my opinion. On one hand, it is obviously a Schwarzenegger star vehicle, directed by the characteristically over-the-top Paul Verhoeven, a ludicrous gore-fest featuring no shortage of cheap thrills. On the other hand, it is a seriously conceptual science fiction trip, and however much it may depart from the Phillip K. Dick source material on which it is based, it still is a genuinely good, thoughtful story at its heart.It opens with a beautiful, mysterious scene on Mars, but soon finds itself back on Earth, with Arnold and his crazy reptilian facial expressions, going 21st-century schizoid man on any number of enemies that he finds coming out of the woodwork to get him. Along the way, there is a lot of (obviously fake) blood, a lot of people dying dramatically, a lot of product placement, and plenty of shameless exploitation of all sorts of things.But somehow, it never becomes disposable. From the word go, Schwarzenegger's title character is one worth caring about, and as the overall plot gradually reveals itself, one can easily become quite engrossed in it. This is not a film without real emotion. There is plenty of drama, a truly big, epic climax and a surprisingly artistic final frame.There are two specific elements in TOTAL RECALL that I think bear mentioning. First, the excellent visual depictions of the planet Mars. I am referring to the *exteriors* where, whatever the filmmaking techniques used, a very evocative picture is painted of another world, both romantic and bleak at the same time.The second thing is the performance of Rachel Ticotin. Her depiction of the character Melina makes this film far better and more watchable that it would have been otherwise. I cannot overstate that. I found myself looking her up to see what else she had acted in. In a film full of performances that are effective but most of them laughable nonetheless, Ticotin is really, seriously believable. For me, she is the heart. (Not Sharon Stone.)I do not know how much I actually like this film. But it is an undeniably entertaining watch, with some interesting ideas about the future and no lack of visual craziness. It is far more violent than I had anticipated, so definitely not for everyone. Also, it is a bit dated when viewed in the present (2013), but not nearly so much as many other films from its era. I give it 6.5 out of 10.",6,2,4,25 February 2013
Edge of Tomorrow," A Very Good Sci-Fi/Character/Action Film
","If you are on the fence about seeing Edge of Tomorrow in the theater, I encourage you to give it a chance. It's a very good film that successfully balances story, characters and action. The specific plot is unusual enough to transcend the clichés that many sci-fi films get stuck in and the lead performances by Cruise and Blunt are excellent. They have great chemistry together.There is plenty of all-out action and the visual effects do a good job of mixing believably utilitarian designs with some very strange alien imagery. If you're looking for thrills, there are plenty of those. But the best thing about this film, in my opinion, is that the characters are engaging. I also appreciate how the story is specific and nuanced, even though the stakes themselves are set on a large scale. There is a nice sort of intimacy at work here.As others have mentioned, an easy way to describe Edge of Tomorrow would be as a mix of Groundhog Day with Starship Troopers/Aliens. If you are like me, that is a great hook. Anyway, this film makes good on its potential deserves much better at the box office than its opening weekend, and I hope that the positive word of mouth gives it some staying power. As far as this type of film goes, this is one of the better examples, and well worth seeing.",9,6,10,18 June 2014
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Better Pacing, Same Problems
","This will no-doubt be one of the most-reviewed films of the year, but here goesThe Good: The Battle of the Five Armies is well-paced. It's still too long, but the story does not drag and there is engaging action almost all the way through. As always, there is some lovely set and costume design and beautiful natural settings. The cast is talented. The dragon Smaug is fantastically dramatic and riveting, in a carry-over from the previous film. Tauriel (more on her later) and Bard represent the best instincts of this trilogy.The Bad: The majority of the action is nakedly CGI and resembles video game visualization, in some cases to a truly absurd degree. There is very little focus on the title character, Bilbo Baggins. Too much uninterrupted fighting in the latter half of the film. The matter of the mountain is not clearly resolved, likely owing to too many different sub plots and character motivations being in the mix. Too many of the would-be serious moments are unintentionally funny. There is a plethora of other issues, but many of them are more subjective in nature. Those that I have just mentioned are the more object problems.Moving onto my subjective observations, the biggest problem with this film and the trilogy that it completes is that of identity crisis. Is it a folksy, personable adventure tale like the book, or is it a deadly serious epic like The Lord of the Rings? Is it an elegantly realized window into a poetic fantasy world like Peter Jackson's first Tolkien trilogy, or is it a wild 3D action adventure? Ultimately, it tries to be all of those things at once and so the whole is overly long and unwieldy, with a rotating sense of focus.These films did get some individual things right. Martin Freeman, Richard Armitage and Luke Evens are wonderful in the roles of Bilbo, Thorin and Bard, respectively. The cast and acting were never problems, even with the meandering scripts. Smaug was a magnificent fantasy creation, voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch and brought to massive, fire-breathing life. It's no accident that the best scenes in the previous films were the ones with the dragon and Gollum, both of them taken almost directly from the book.But I want to focus on the original character of Tauriel to point out how Peter Jackson's The Hobbit could have been a better story even if it didn't stick to the book verbatim. The book featured virtually no female characters. Fortunately, the films addressed that, but it is Tauriel (a made up character) who fits this story far, far, far better than Galadriel (a canon character and fan favorite on screen since The Fellowship of the Ring).While Galadriel, Elrond, Saruman, Gandalf and Radagast are occupied with a story arc present almost entirely for the sole purpose of making The Hobbit resemble The Lord of the Rings in ways that the book never did, Tauriel's scenes are intimate and unpretentious, much like those of Bilbo Baggins. Say what one will about the Elf- Dwarf romance, but it was one of the most grounded and personable aspects of these past two films. Personally, I would have preferred a straight-up adaption of the source novel, in one film. However, I think that there was a missed opportunity here to expand the story into multiple films without losing the tone of the book, and Tauriel is the best example of how to do that in a way that is fresh and forward-thinking.Ultimately, though, these films were not for fans of the book. They were for fans of the Lord of the Rings films. In that sense, the failure of the Hobbit Trilogy is that it mistakenly supposes that those previous films succeeded on spectacle. In fact, they succeeded in the elegance of their execution, well-written stories brought to life by tasteful visuals. This time around, we were presented with an over-extended, thrown-together buildup to a full-throttle throwdown of unhinged action. Is that bad, in and of itself? It depends on the viewer. Not my thing, but I am not everyone.If you loved An Unexpected Journey and The Desolation of Smaug, then you will likely enjoy this one, as long as you can handle more nonstop action. That is the primary difference present in The Battle of the Five Armies.",5,2,5,23 December 2014
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," On its own merits, a very exciting, dramatic film.
","I am a huge Star Wars fan, based on the original trilogy. I thought that Episode I was nearly unwatchable, and Episode II a bit better but still not up to snuff. So I do not approve of everything that says 'Star Wars' on it. However, in spite of some occasional hiccups, I genuinely, tremendously enjoyed Episode III - Revenge of the Sith.Some point to this film as lacking in plot mystery, since anyone who has been paying attention knows basically what is going to happen. This is the part of the story that connects-the-dots back to the original Star Wars - A New Hope film. For me, though, this was one of the most suspenseful, eerie viewing experiences that I have ever had. That may sound like uncreditable fanboy hyperbole, and maybe it is, but I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. There is a sort of claustrophobic, buidling tension from the opening scene. One knows that at some point, there is going to be 'the moment' where the Jedi finally realize what is actually going on, and where the central character makes his trade of allegiances. Even though the portrayal of Anakin Skywaylker in the prequel trilogy has often been far short of stellar, Revenge of the Sith frames it so effectively that it becomes genuinely gripping.The main cast is still a mixed bag. Natalie Portman and Hayden Christiansen...enough has been said of that. If only their parts had been written better. But the two performances that make this film are Ewan Mcgregor (who really carried Episode II) and especially Ian McDiarmid as Palpatine. Talk about intense. This film would not have been half as good without his turn as the man at the true, dark center of it all. And in the cyborg 'Jedi killer' General Grevious, George Lucas finally creates a truly dynamic CGI character, one who serves to add to the already complex mix.Speaking of which, the visual effects are quite good, and for the most part actually serve the story, which could not be said of Episodes I or II. There is a little bit of out-of-place cartoonishness, true, but just a bit. The space sequences look very cool, starfighters and capital ships alike. Corsuscant gets darker here, and the final confrontation on Mustafar is a fiery crucible both literally and figuratively.I have to say that I was surprised at this film. It is very dark and (for Star Wars) violent. I did not expect that, but credit George Lucas for finally delivering something genuinely dramatic and exciting. The pacing in Revenge of the Sith is generally quick and relentless. It slows down at all the right moments, to get inside Anakin's head and focus on the inevitably-turning torture of his internal state.There are several deleted scenes, some of them dealing more with the formation of the Rebel Alliance. I would have loved to have seen those in the final cut, but there frankly is just too much action and exposition in play here to fit it all into a single film. I will not claim that Revenge of the Sith is perfect, or all that artistically deft, or as good as the first couple of original films. But it excited, mesmerized, and thrilled the heck out of me. For that, I have to give it high marks.",8,0,2,5 February 2013
Prometheus," Worthwhile in spite of its flaws...
","I will make no attempt to argue with those who assert the presence of a number of flaws in Prometheus. But even taking all of that in to account, I still have to say that I like the film. There is at least a scene or two that does not really make sense within the story, but this is the type of story that can accommodate certain things that do not make sense. Posing questions is a big part of the point, after all. Now, I fully agree that it definitely could have been better, more concise and developed some of the characters better. Still, I think that it is worth watching, and holds my interests in repeat viewings.Of course, the best thing about Prometheus is the visual element, particularly in the first 20-30 minutes or so. Gorgeously beautiful. In general, in spite of being imaginative science fiction it feels very real, which is nice for a change in today's filmmaking climate. The key cast members Rapace, Fassbender, Theron and Elba are all very strong. And the ending, when it finally comes, is very effective. I love the beautiful visual that accompanies the final character narration, and then the last image hits in a way that cannot help but elicit goosebumps in a sci-fi fan.The biggest problems are that the middle section of the film is not nearly as tight as the beginning and ending are, and that some of the supporting characters do not add much to the story, and indeed take away from it a bit. I am a fan of the original Alien film, but I did not have a problem watching Prometheus as a standalone story. In that sense, again I enjoyed it in spite of its flaws. A little clumsy in places maybe, but I find it philosophically compelling when taken as a whole, demoralizing and a bit terrifying yet still hopeful. The final impression that rested in my mind when the credits rolled was more than worth the time spent.",7,1,4,2 February 2013
The Wolverine," A Wonderfully-Made Film 8.5-9.0/10
","Wow. This is the Wolverine film that should have been made in the first place. It is one of the most viscerally powerful comic-book films that I have ever seen. There are not just fantasy-like action sequences with flashy special effects; these are fantastically choreographed scenes that hit as hard as real life. And there are a lot of them. Even more importantly, there is a compelling story, a well-written script and a *superb* cast, all of which make this film something truly meaningful. I will admit that I have suggested that this character has been overexposed, but that was partly based on the messy, unnecessary X-Men Origins: Wolverine. But I have nothing but praise for any decision that results in a film this good.The setting in Japan brings all sorts of elements into play that work great with the character of Wolverine. Of course, the accompanying aesthetic touches give this film a unique feel among comic-book adaptions. The pacing is right on; the action scenes are relentless, the poignant scenes are breathless, and the dialog is sharp. I find it to be very well-balanced overall.There may have been a thing or two not quite on the masterpiece level, and I am still ruminating on the story and plot developments in my mind. But this is an incredibly well-directed film, with the cinematography, visual effects, sound and again, the cast all contribute to the greater whole.There is quite a lot of violence, and a bit more gore-ish content than found in the typical superhero film. But this is Wolverine. More than anything else, this is just a wonderful film in and of itself, but I also think that it does a fine job of (1) making X-Men: The Last Stand seem better and more meaningful in retrospect, (2) setting up future X-Men films and most importantly one might say (3) erasing the memory of the Origins film.As usual for me, I avoided 3D and saw this film in 2D. No regrets whatsoever about that decision. In any event, I highly recommend The Wolverine. As good as X1 and X2 were, and as much as I liked X-Men: First Class, this one might be my favorite X-Film yet. I enjoyed both Iron Man 3 and Man of Steel (really), but even at that, The Wolverine is arguably the best superhero film released so far in 2013, and possibly one of the best yet, period.",9,11,23,28 July 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," Third-Act Overload, 7.5/10
","The first thing that must be said about TDKR is that it is not as sharp as Batman Begins and/or The Dark Knight. A similar thing has happened here as happened to the X-Men and Spiderman franchises, where the first two installments of those respective trilogies were very solid, but where the third installments went off the rails a bit in trying to include too many characters and story elements. Granted, the Batman films have their own unique tone, but the parallels are there.In general, the conceptual ideas at work in TDKR are good, and the ambition to put them all together in an epic statement is admirable. However, this film would have been better served by either cutting certain elements out, or by being presented in two separate two-hour films. Instead, it is a single film pushing three hours, yet still unable to adequately develop every aspect of plot and character development.There are two things in particular that bother me about TDKR. The first is the 'hole in the earth' prison. It is a compelling idea, but taking Bruce Wayne there and then having him escape pushes the envelope of believability too far, and is the film's single greatest misstep. There is simply too much either unexplained, or not explained satisfactorily about how much time has elapsed, how Bruce manages to return to Gotham City, and in particular how the only two people to escape from a virtually inescapable prison are a pre-teen girl and a man recovering from a back injury, especially when the practical task is a matter of physicality.The other thing that bothers me is the screenplay's treatment of Alfred. It does not seem consistent with his established character that he would abandon Bruce. And his reappearance at the end of the film feels a bit abbreviated, final scene notwithstanding.But even taking those things into account, I still enjoyed this film and consider it well worth watching. There is a breathtaking scope in the cinematography, Hans Zimmer's excellent score and in many of the powerful themes present in the story. The airplane scene at the beginning of the film is a fantastic, tense visual set piece. The bridges/tunnels/football stadium sequence as well. The echoes of the Occupy movement bring an ominous weight to the film. And of course, the terrific ensemble cast as always. Overall, there is a lot to like here, even if there are reasons to dislike as well.I give both Batman Begins and The Dark Knight 10/10 scores. The Dark Knight Rises gets a 7.5/10. Not great or flawless, but still a very interesting, epic and ultimately enjoyable film.",7,1,1,15 July 2013
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Big, Clumsy Mess
","Man of Steel knew what it was, and it stuck to that vision. Plenty of people disliked it. I happen to have really enjoyed the Superman reboot, but I cannot say the same about this one. If ever a film has been more ambitious than capable, it is BvS, which is packed to the brim with characters, ideas and plot lines, but doesn't juggle them very well at all. This is like a worse version of Avengers: Age of Ultron, a film that should have been great collapsing under its own weight.BvS is klutzy to the extreme, which is a shame considering many of the individual pieces being good. I appreciate darker superhero stories, but this one is just a slog, way too long and surprisingly boring. It's not well-put-together like the Nolan films were (for the most part), nor is it fun like some of the wackier takes of the past. Big fail, in my book. WB needs to clean house, creatively, starting with Snyder.",5,3,8,25 March 2016
Blade Runner," Tremendously Impressing, Mesmerizing Sci-Fi Noir
","I just watched Blade Runner for the first time. Considering that I am nearly 30 years old and a lifelong science fiction fan, it seems odd that I waited this long. Anyway, the version that I watched is the Director's Cut, so I cannot speak to the differences present in the Original Version, the Final Cut, etc. But I came away quite impressed with this film, for its restraint and strange otherness as much as for any of the more obvious, overt virtues that most sci-fi films possess.The visual look of the film is very dark and ultimately bleak in concept, but the images of a future Los Angeles are incredibly executed and often beautiful in a strange, unsettling way. I am not sure how many films I have ever seen that have managed to capture a comparable sort of frightening futuristic realism. It still looks incredible in 2013. There is such a transportative depth to it. What an achievement for a filmmaker in the early 80s.I think that the cast is great, especially Rutger Hauer and Sean Young, but really everyone. (Edward James Olmos, yes.) The musical score by Vangelis is a very effective fit. It reminds me, in a way, of the music from Twin Peaks in the way that it is very slowly, hypnotically emotional. Dialogue is fairly minimal relative to most films; this one uses images, physical emotionality and a haunting, aching used of dark and selective light to tell the story.And it definitely requires the viewer to pay close attention and do a lot of thinking. Even at that, some things are left to question. I love a film that does that. This is the antithesis of a film that spoon-feeds every idea and point. I know that the Original Version had voice-over narration that explained things more clearly, but I enjoyed the subtlety of the Director's Cut. From the haunting first aerial view of Los Angeles to the wonderfully artistic, perfectly played final scene, this was an incredible experience for me as a viewer. How could I give it anything but a 10? There really should be more films like this.",10,2,5,5 February 2013
Monsters University," Mostly very mediocre, but with a great ending...
","I have never watched a film that had quite the effect of lulling me into low expectations, only to snap my mind with a suddenly entertaining twist, as Monsters University. The first 80% or so of the film was pretty much exactly what I expected, i.e. a tired, gimmicky and extremely clichéd presentation that was occasionally broken up by something genuinely funny. But then the film surprised me by getting really good for the last 15 or 20 minutes. That late uptick in quality did not fully atone for how predictable and mediocre the rest of the film was, but it did at least leave me with something interesting to walk away with.The biggest problem with Monsters University is the university part. It is played for, again, just about every tired cliché imaginable. (Similar to Hotel Transylvania in the early-going prevalence of that.) Some of the gags are just painfully weak. For younger viewers who have not absorbed all of those cultural tropes yet, some of it may be compelling, but for an adult viewer it all seems awfully lazy. And the rah-rah marching band music is just embarrassingly awkward.There are some great individual elements, of course. A genuinely LOL moment surfaces every once in a while, breaking the predictable monotony. A sequence with monsters racing through underground tunnels while trying to avoid glowing pink sea urchins is a terrific visual concept. The Helen Mirren-voiced dragon/centipede Dean character is a truly inspired (and scary) design. And of course, the plot twists near the end of the film start actually getting exciting. But all of that is somewhat wasted on the whole. If only the producers could have ditched the university angle whilst retaining all of the good elements, maybe it could have been great. As is, it's okay.Part of the curse of MU is that it has to measure up to its predecessors. Early on, one could depend on a Pixar film to be wonderfully entertaining for everyone, regardless of age. I consider the original Monsters Inc. to be one of the best. But those days when the studio's films were uniformly fresh, deft and uncommonly intelligent seem like an era long gone, now. The animation has kept getting better, but the stories have taken a bit of a nosedive.At least Monsters University is not as conceptually incoherent as Brave, but on the other hand it makes less of an effort to break new ground. Not a bad film this, and certainly a great choice for the kids, but nothing like what Pixar used to produce. Taken on its own merits, it is a decent but not great film.",7,0,2,3 July 2013
Casino Royale," Edgy and Elegant
","I've recently decided to watch or re-watch all of the James Bond films. I have probably only seen about 25% of them, and none of the Daniel Craig turns until I saw Skyfall in the theater last month. I knew going in that Casino Royale has a high reputation, and I feel that it lives up to it.This is a sharp, fast-paced film with an elegant aesthetic. Daniel Craig works for me. His stoic physicality and sky-blue eyes give a real edge and seriousness to the role. To me, Pierce Brosnan never had that sort of edge. Eva Green is just luminous, and her part is significant and well-written, not a throwaway gimmick to add cheap sex appeal. The cinematography and settings are beautiful. There are some terrific, relentless action sequences, but also some very studied quiet and casual moments. Just a pinch of humor, as well.I regard Casino Royale far more highly than Skyfall. The latter is entertaining and has some great moments, but the former is to me just so much better as an overall film. Not just a fun action film, but a work of art. Very nice.",9,3,5,7 January 2013
Thor: The Dark World," A Mundane Epic
","This is the sort of film that I could write and rewrite a review of several times, attempting to find just the right thing to say. For the sake of avoiding that, I will be brief.Thor: The Dark World brings more characters and a wider scope of a story (and superb visual effects) into play, relative to its predecessor. Unfortunately, it loses the warmth and simple beauty that was present the first time around and suffers from an extremely clichéd, uninspiring and ultimately uninteresting execution of the overall plot. Viscerally, it is like watching handfuls of charcoal pencils repeatedly crushed for a couple of hours. Dark, yes, but compelling, no.It is not a 'bad' film per se. It is just not particularly good, in my opinion. In the theater, it felt very lengthy and I was fatigued as a viewer, which either means that it is too long, or has the effect of being so. Either way, not a good thing.In particular, the villain is underdeveloped, as is the relationship arc between Thor and Jane. Generally, the story is clear and easy to follow, but it is a bit cluttered to the point of meandering effect, and does not manage to escape a certain pervasive dullness. The employment of humor is a double-edged sword – it undermines the needed elegant seriousness of the story, while at the same time mercifully making it watchable.I want to note a few scenes, though, that do impress and inspire me. Early in the film, a few moments are spent in a tavern and in the street outside, somewhere relatively pedestrian in Asgard. It feels wintry and almost like A Christmas Carol. It also feels more personable than most of what follows. There is a beautiful funeral scene as well, very evocative and for me, a return to the mythological pleasures of the first Thor film. Finally, a scene in which Frigga engages in mesmerizing hand-to-hand combat with the villain. These are instances in which I can feel the potential for how great a Thor film COULD be, with a truly great character-driven story and the right director. Here's hoping for next time.Overall, technically decent but a mundane viewer experience. To put a different way, less than the sum of its parts. I would group this film with The Incredible Hulk and Iron Man 2 as Marvel Studios' least interesting installments so far. 6.5/10",6,0,2,12 November 2013
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A Crowded Blaze of Nostalgia and Charisma
","As with any film that has the buzz of The Force Awakens, it's easy to slip into hyperbole here. But in many ways, this is simply a very well- crafted example of a typical modern blockbuster. It just happens to be Star Wars, and in that it is both a blessing and a curse.One good comparison would be The Avengers. You have a talented, charismatic group of characters playing off each other with great chemistry in a well-paced, confidently directed story that has plenty of action and humor. In short, great thrill-based entertainment. But as with The Avengers, The Force Awakens does not prioritize its actual story very highly. There is a fresh quest-based idea (set up in the opening crawl) that is really a great idea, but the film only loosely maintains focus on that. There is just too much going on, introductions of new characters and reunions of old characters.And that brings us to the nostalgia play. It is great to see Star Wars once again sparkling with snappy energy and wit, and once again graced in presence by the beloved original characters. But it did not need to directly re-stage so very many specific story, plot and location ideas from the classic trilogy. Unfortunately, in doing so this film loses a bit of its own focus (re: the quest) in its familiar detours.That being said, in almost every way other than story, The Force Awakens is a better-than-average sci-fi/fantasy film, and the terrific new cast of characters bode well for the future.In hiring JJ Abrams, Lucasfilm brought on board someone who knows how to direct actors and stitch together something eminently engaging. One of the great ironies of The Force Awakens is that even as it firmly refutes nearly everything about the prequel era, and corrects for many of the missteps that weighed those films, it also makes it much easier to appreciate George Lucas the visionary. His latter-day Star Wars films were never this easy to watch, but they did posses a mythic, intrepid weirdness that is now missing. Hopefully, future Star Wars installments will *truly* get back to the beginning by finding a happy medium. Only then will balance truly be restored.",7,7,25,6 January 2016
Pitch Perfect," Extremely Disappointing to Me
","Basically, there is one character (Fat Amy) who singlehandedly makes this film almost-pseudo-watchable. She's irresistible. Without her, it would be 1/10. Extremely clichéd and unimaginative plot, with humor that is often unbelievably weak and forced, frequently over-sexed and in many cases, not really genuinely funny. All of it adds up to something that you might expect to see on Disney (although I enjoyed High School Musical far, far, far more), but with enough crude content to justifiably preclude that target audience. Pitch Perfect is not a really good, emotionally believable story; neither is campy/ironic/self-aware enough to be the good kind of ridiculous. Maybe it is only I who am to blame for going to see this, and it is only my opinion, but this is the worst movie that I have seen in recent memory. (Even Zoolander seems better in retrospective comparison, and that is saying something.)",3,16,35,14 October 2012
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Now THIS Is What It's All About
","The first Hunger Games film was decent; Catching Fire is superb. As other reviewers have said, this sequel improves upon its predecessor in pretty much every single way. The cast has a more balanced chemistry, so that Lawrence does not have to carry as much of the film herself. But she is terrific again from start to finish.The overall plot narrative comes across great. The visual design, editing and cinematography are really well-tailored to suit the story. It feels like all of the pieces came together here in just the right way, from the director to the cast to the crew. While the first film was solid but clearly an adaption of a book, Catching Fire is a fully-realized film. It is fluent, inspiring, emotional, exciting and so many other things. I highly recommend it.",9,1,16,6 December 2013
Godzilla," Fantastic Atmosphere, Breathtaking Scale, Serious Tone
","I am not generally a fan of Godzilla films. The sort of popcorn entertainment that most of them have been just does not appeal much to me. I went to see this film on a bit of a whim. And I do not regret it. I'll get to the point -- the monster(s) in this film are incredible in execution. Incredible.This Godzilla has fantastic atmosphere. It's played very seriously and with great restraint, so that when crazy things do start happening, they are playing on significant built-up tension. That's the way that I like films, and in a lot of ways, this one shares qualities with horror and/or psychological thrillers, more than 'monster' movies.Do the human characters seem a bit one-dimensional? Sure, but although this story is told from their points of view, it is clearly not about them. For me, Bryan Cranston, Ken Watanabe, Aaron Taylor-Johnson and so forth work fine as supporting players, because they do not distract, and indeed feed into, the 'bigger' picture, if you will.It bears remembering that this story is based on highly-improbable, sensationalized fantasy. If you break it down that way, no, it's not realistic. However, and in this case it is a huge however, the scale, sense of size and realism in this film is breathtaking. I can't imagine that the visual/visceral execution could have been any better, given the subject matter. Things get insane, but never in a cheap way.Overall, you should see this version of Godzilla if you appreciate foreboding and less-is-more cinematography in your monster movies. This is not a free-for-all action onslaught, although it does have incredible action. Nor is it really 'fun.' But it is serious, skillful and awe- inspiring, the latter to a degree that I have rarely experienced before.",8,1,3,19 May 2014
Looper," Inconsistent Core Story
","First of all, this is a well-made film in nearly every way. Acting, cinematography, dialog, visual effects, sets and locations. And the directing is good on a scene-by-scene basis, with some very nice moments of theme reinforcement. The basic story is also interesting. And of course, there is the gimmick of Joseph Gordon-Levitt playing a young version of Bruce Willis' character, which is really well done all around.However, and some other reviewers have noted it, the story here takes a turn about midway through and the film as a whole winds up feeling inconsistently focused. In some cases, change-ups and uncertainties are good. In this case, it all feels more like it is unfinished, and could have used some more revisions.***SPOILERS BELOW***Specifically, the whole idea of 'The Rainmaker' needed to have been worked into the screenplay earlier and in a more substantial fashion. As is, it feels to me like a peripheral story element that gets suddenly upgraded to being the primary focus, but there isn't enough of a full-circle effect for what happens in the later parts of the film to feel consistent with what has already happened in the early parts of the film.All of that being said, though, I do not think that Looper is a bad film, and it certainly has enough going for it to merit a positive rating from me. My gripes here are not the same as those I have with Star Trek Into Darkness, for example. Looper is a bit unfocused as a whole, but more as a matter of editing and foreshadowing. It's still a well-written film, beat-for-beat. The fact that it moves slowly at times is not a flaw--that's just the type of film that this is. And there are some truly powerful moments here and there, brought to life by great technical filmmaking and a top-notch cast. Rian Johnson may not have hit perfection here, but he definitely has my attention as an up-and-coming director.",7,0,0,10 August 2014
Furious 7," Poignant But Franchise Excess At Its Worst
","The lifeblood and virtually only redeeming factor in this film-- aside from a couple of the car sequences--is the emotional backbone of character continuity. Elephant in the room, Paul Walker but also Diesel, Rodriguez, etc. Without that, this is just an absurd maelstrom of cars and bullets and buffoonery. Most of the action is just staged chaos, most of the humor is unfunny and most of the story is contrived setups for the action, as well as emotional exploitation.Granted, one should not go into this film expecting anything different from all of that, but even so I think that this film can basically be filed under 'escalate by any means possible.' The ending hits the bittersweet beats that the audience expects, and that alone is worth something, but the couple of hours leading up to the ending constitute a a big, crazy mess, entertaining perhaps depending on one's tastes but not anything worth high praise. Take that for what it is.",4,2,16,17 April 2015
