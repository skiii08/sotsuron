The Expendables 2," it is p**p
","'If you love life, don't waste time' Bruce Lee once said this.Sorry Bruce, I need to apologise.... to my family. At the end of my mortal life I will be cursing the wasted time that is EXP2.I am happy to give cash to my old heroes, but the movie just SUCKED at every level. Obvious 'dead meat/revenge' character, Asian stereotypes, Bad guys with the complete wrong spoken language (Thai speaking Nepalese, Albanian/Bulgarians). Was Chuck (my number 1 hero) a CGI character? He and his face hardly moved. Sucky story, sucky dialogue, sucky effects, sucky predictable soundtrack... it just sucked!Just don't do it. Wait for it on cable TV and sit around ripping into it.",3,39,62,23 August 2012
Spectre," lame... product placement abounds
","To me, it seemed to be a soft remake of 'tomorrow never dies'. Too much and too obvious product placement. Cars, phones, watches, computers... all there on obvious, lingering display for us public to consume.Craig's 4th outing has moved Bond back towards the farce of earlier Bond's and not maintained the rawness of his original appearance. The decline has not been a sudden one, each outing has been slightly more disappointing and less exciting. Big explosions do not a great movie make... Casino Royale was a fantastic new beginning for Bond. Spectre seems tired and clich√©d.Shame",3,5,11,24 November 2015
