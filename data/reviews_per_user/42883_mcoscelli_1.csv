It," a strong horror movie definitely the best of the year however lacked basic originality.
","It (2017) is a strong and enigmatic film. pennywise is a very strong and interesting character you feel as if you want to delve knee deep into his life and want to know where he came from. It manages to mix the horror theme with others such as adventure, this is key because otherwise, you might be feeling bored halfway through. it has very small details in it which are key to its film success this year, in the way of which when pennywise is about to attack his eyes turn yellow, also in the way of which the lamp post where the missing person sheet is displayed has so many holes in it from earlier missing people. it has a solid intriguing plot throughout in the way of which a group of bullied middle school kids comes together to eventually kill Pennyworth. However, a lot of deaths lack basic originality and you can almost always tell what is about to happen next.",8,1,1,3 December 2017
