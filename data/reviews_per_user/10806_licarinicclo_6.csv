Django Unchained," Short comment
","I start by saying that I do not like western movies, but I love Tarantino's films. I must say, however, I imagined different apple and that fortunately mine is not a classic western film as there is a lot of blood and a different comedy. And maybe that's why I liked it. I put only eight because as I said earlier apple I imagined different much more western, then I think a couple of songs do not enter much with the film, and then because the protagonist seemed very trivial as a character in fact I preferred other secondary characters such as German dentist. Anyway, I really liked Franco Nero's cameo, it's really good.",8,0,1,25 October 2018
Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind," Short coment
",It is a film that I recommend to everyone really beautiful fantastic designs and also the very pretty plot even if it is a classic of the Ghibli studio. I have to say that the landscapes and the characters I liked a lot as always is made me excited. the only thing is that I would have made the protagonist die. in my opinion his sacrifice would have been much more significant.,8,0,0,7 November 2018

Incredibles 2," Short coment
","A really good movie. 8 points more than deserved. A film that I recommend to everyone not only to families. The only flaw is that in seven years I expected something more, and that the super criminal was nothing but a female version of the first. But I really liked the references to Batman and the DC world in general.",8,1,2,21 September 2018
