It," Genuinely terrifying
","Just got out of the new IT movie and I utterly thought it was spine-chilling! I'll have to give as much credit to the cast, direction, cinematography and musical score for what made this film all that worthwhile. There's plentiful scares often at a nightmarish level and most certainly, I have to agree with the critics that this movie is an immense improvement over the TV-miniseries - which can be seen as tame by today's standards. If you get the chance to catch this movie before IT'S too late, you'll surely float too!",7,3,5,21 September 2017
Baby Driver," Best two hours of my life!
",Coming out of this movie I thought that those last two hours of my life were AWESOME! The action sequences and killing were fast paced and had happened right on time; especially for the opening and ending scenes as those moments were simultaneously insane and engaging. I also adored the cinematography and editing that went with this movie. And the best part: the whole movie is set to an awesome soundtrack! I would advocate this movie to anyone who's into this much fun as I was.,7,2,8,30 June 2017
La La Land," Best movie of 2016!
","I did not except to fall in love with this movie, but I'm glad I have.I thought that the musical scenes were great, especially the cinematography and score. Gosling and Stone are both top-notch in this and it quite relates to my love and passion of making movies. This movie deserves the Oscars it had won, but BEST PICTURE?! Boy, was I ticked off this didn't win Best Picture - it did at first, but it was a mistake.In general, I consider this to be one of my favorite movies out of all of 2016: THE DEFINITION AND EMBODIMENT OF DISAPPOINTMENT AFTER DISAPPOINTMENT!",7,1,6,25 May 2017
The Disaster Artist," A good story to one of the greatest bad movies ever made
","Oh hi Mark, I was hyped to see this movie ever since I saw the trailers. The Disaster Artist is a biography of what it was like making The Room; which seemed to start out as a good concept in the pre-production stages, but once it got to the troubled production - the movie goes to show that life can be hard and that accomplishing your dream is far from easy. The cast was noble especially the Franco brothers as Tommy and Greg, and overall, I thought the film delivered a virtuous significance. Now that I think of it, this is probably just as good or even better than The 'actual' Room! Don't you agree?",6,14,23,28 December 2017
Straight Outta Compton," Great old Compton fun!
","Loved this movie from the start of it; by the fact, I listen to their music all the time. The time period that the film settles in works, the soundtrack is epic, the characters are great and the story was just top-notch and powering. Way better than 'Notorious' and by far, the best movie I have ever seen in 2015!",8,8,24,1 June 2017
Deadpool," Astonishing.
","I remember seeing this in the theaters back in 2016 and boy, what a treat this movie was! A smashing mix of action, satire and black comedy. Just about perfect. Now normally, I wouldn't consider myself a fan of Marvel - but along comes this movie, which also inspired me to write a film of my own; combining a women's comedy with this superhero film and its foremost ingredients that make this film so good. Likewise, the opening sequence staggered me with its epic panorama tying into the prologue's big action scene, the satirized opening credits and 'Angel of the Morning' song that effectively enhanced the mood. I owe it all to Marvel and whoever rhymes with 'Polverine' for making this film possible. As for the fourth wall breaking? That's like sixteen walls!",8,1,2,23 February 2018
The Nice Guys," Nice! Just nice.
","One of my other favorite movies of 2016! The 1970s setting was fantastic - I'm always up for a movie set in those times, if they were to do it right - especially for the humor, action sequences, soundtrack and characters of Crowe and Gosling. The film's tag-line admits 'The Nice Guys' are 'far from nice', but this movie has a stand for nice. You know you only live once? So, why not see this twice like I did!",6,0,1,24 June 2017
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," The last GOOD Transformers movie...
","I love this movie, especially by the fact it's an action one - and Michael Bay sure knows how to do an action film right! The last hour or so of the film really blew my mind, so much fun and games for everyone. Not only that, but I find it to be in my top list of the best films of all time; I may have seen most of the greatest films ever made and had different opinions on them, but none of them I have seen can top this film here! An exhilarated masterpiece to the live-action Transformers saga out of the three films I own and the last GOOD one that I know of. Going forward, the films fluctuate in quality: some being good or bad, but none of them can recapture the magic of three.",7,4,5,10 November 2017
Evil Dead II," Jumpy
","It's been a while since I've seen this movie as a whole. Overall, I find it wincing at times - by the fact that this is a horror movie - but still enjoyed it. I found better than the original from 1981, but even that movie's alright. The only things that may have bothered me at times were the noticeable inconsistencies, but in general - this movie is quality.",4,0,0,25 May 2017
