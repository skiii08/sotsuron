Mission: Impossible III," One of the Most Intense Action Movies Iv'e Seen
","Mission Impossible 3 has become one of my favorite action movies. It is non stop action, there is practically nothing but action. I liked the first Mission Impossible, i wasn't much for the second Mission Impossible movie, it was okay, but it was a little flat and there wasn't as much excitement or action as expected, some of it was a little boring i guess. I think that that Mission Impossible 3 is better than the second one, even though the second one was okay. I think that Mission Impossible 3 is kind of like an old fashioned action movie, like an old school action movie. The way action movies were back in the 90's and 80's i think. A ruthless bad guy, played by Phillip Hoffman. He is a really good bad guy in the movie, he is very ruthless, he is scum, you wish he would die a horrible death. And he is a very mysterious bad guy too, he has very few scenes. And he is great in all of them. And he also has very few lines, he doesn't talk much, when he does he is threatening someone or trying to kill someone, such as the beginning scene in the movie, which is a very intense scene. And he has a good fight with Tom Cruise at the end of the movie, and it was satisfying when he got killed. There is a real good guy and bad guy element in the movie, which was cool, just like the good old days. I think Phillip Hoffman is one of the best bad guys ever, he is one of those bad guys that you start to think, 'What goes on inside his head?' I think he was one of the best bad guys ever. This movie has very little plot, which is good, no messing around. The action scenes are kind of long and exciting and very intense. The beginning action scene, the bridge scene, the skyscraper jump scene, the car chase, and the fight at the end were great action scenes. It is a little violent for a PG-13 and very menacing and intense. The bridge action sequence has a very good 'the bad guy is getting away.' feel. I like how high tech and old fashioned the action is. And it has some good special effects, explosions, and shootouts, and stunts, the helicopter chase in the movie is very cool. And the movie is loud. And the good thing is, it doesn't have any techno electronic music in the movie, which is good. And it doesn't have any rock and roll music during the action scenes. The music in the movie made the movie very intense and exciting. And i like how Tom Cruise's wife/girlfriend gets kidnapped by the bad guy, and he threatens to kill her if Cruise doesn't retrieve the 'Rabbits Foot'. And i like the scene where Hoffman is threatening to kill his wife, very ruthless character. And it has one of the best opening scenes ever. This movie really made me want to root for Ethan Hunt, and hoping to get his wife back and take down the bad guy. I was quite surprised when i first saw the movie, since i dident care much for the second one. But there are some weakeness's i guess. The first half of the movie was good of course, with some good action scenes and stuff. But its basically after the Vatican scene is when the movie really starts to heat up. A few scenes before the bridge scene aren't all that great i guess. This movie is exciting, action packed, and old fashioned, and a great bad guy. Everyone should enjoy it.",9,0,1,18 September 2007
The Bourne Identity," Jason Bourne Is A Character To Care For
","I give The Bourne Identity a strong 8 out of 10. Its pretty good. I have not read the books, Im not a big book reader anyway. The movie has enough to keep you interested. It has a good character, that is Jason Bourne. Matt Damon plays him well, he is very believable as Jason Bourne. You can really care for the main character. He has no idea who he is, what his name is or anything. Until he starts to beat people up, he thinks there is something very suspicious about himself, he was an assassin. That's cool. He was a killing machine, that know's a lot about how to work with guns, he knows some good fighting moves, but he wants to know how he knows how to do all these things, and who he was, and who he worked for. The movie is something you can really identify with. And I really liked all the stuff between Franka Potente and Matt Damon, pretty good chemistry, and the movie is a good journey and adventure, you keep learning the more it goes. A lot of the action scenes were pretty cool. Im not much for the car chase, but I like all the other action scenes. The fight with the assassin in the hotel room, the scene on the stairwell at the end of the movie, the scene between Clive Owen and Matt Damon, I like the Embassy scene when Matt Damon climbs down the wall. And the fights and stuff are pretty brutal. And Jason Bourne uses anything for his disposal. I like how a lot of bad guys are after Bourne. There is a lot to keep you interested and entertained, there may be a few weaknesses, maybe some of it kind of takes up time I guess. There are some parts that don't seem to be needed or that are not really important. A good action movie with a main character to care a lot for.",8,4,6,10 December 2007
Shooter," OK, But Kind of Flat
","Shooter was an alright movie, nothing special though. I don't see why people really think the movie is like an old school action movie, it may at times, but not really. Everyone thinks its like an 80's action movie, like Rambo. Yes, Whalberg may be a military killing machine on the run from cops and government guys, but that doesn't automatically make it an old school action movie. Whalberg did kill quite a few guys, but he wasn't mowing down people and wild gunplay and blowing everything up in sight. That's what an 80's action movie is, mowing down a bunch of people, and blowing a whole lot of stuff and all that. It may have had a resemblance of an old school action movie, but not much. There was quite a bit of talk, but the talking isn't all that great. There is a lot of action, but not constant. I kind of like the opening action scene, the snowing mountains action scene, and kind of the farmhouse part, but the ending was okay. The action dident seem to go on and on. There isn't much to the characters and the dialoge and stuff is flat, isn't too interesting. It was pretty violent, and kind of gory, but blood isn't exacally all over the place.An okay action movie, but i guess it could have been a little bit better. People said it was like an old school action movie, but i dident think it was very old school, and that's what kind of disappointed me.",7,0,2,22 September 2007
