Requiem for a Dream," I want to die.
","I'm unsure what to say. I can't really say I liked a movie that makes me want to kill myself, but it was such an incredibly powerful, shocking film. If I could go back, I can't say whether or not I'd watch it again. The last five minutes were the most disturbing scenes I have ever seen in any movie, and I have seen a LOT of disturbing movies. Forget D.A.R.E., this is the way to keep kids off drugs.I'm going to go watch a Disney movie or something now.",Null,0,0,8 February 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," spectacular
","The Two Towers is a stunning follow-up to last year's blockbuster The Fellowship of the Ring. While its pacing is a little strange (it's got no exposition or closure), director Jackson's genius style seamlessly weaves the three stories of Frodo and Sam; Legolas, Gimli and Aragorn; and Pippin and Merry. The special effects are jaw-dropping; the Battle of Helm's Deep is biblical in its proportions. Heavy on action and light on character development, I think Fellowship was better; however, Two Towers does not fall too far behind.",10,0,0,19 December 2002
