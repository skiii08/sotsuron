Requiem for a Dream," Top Film - it makes Trainspotting look like a documentary.
","Well, what can I say other than this was one of the best films I have seen this year (along with; 15 Minutes, Final Fantasy, Hannibal, Pearl Harbor and Planet of the Apes).The story concentrates on the lives of four people who are effectively drug addicts, following them through the highs and lows of their lives.  It demonstrates that no matter who you are, what age, whatever lifestyle you're from, drugs will change your life forever.  The film is very graphic at times and may not be everyone's cup of tea - you couldn't sit down and watch it with your parents, but maybe I'm wrong?Sometimes you can't help but feel sorry for the characters, their desperate need and moral descent.  Unlike most American films, this doesn't have a happy ending, there are no heroes, no real villains, just everyday next door type people living their lives the only way they know.I enjoyed the film for it's straight down the line rawness, it was a bit slow to begin with, but before you know it you are really feeling for the characters, and intrigued as to what will happen next.  It appears to be quite a low budget movie, but the camera work intensifies each situation so realistically you won't be disappointed - you don't need expensive special effects.In short, the message the story is trying to get across is don't do drugs, if you are going to, face the consequence.  I will definitely be keeping an eye out for future releases by Darren Aronofsky.",10,0,0,5 September 2001
