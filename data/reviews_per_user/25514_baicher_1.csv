Hereditary," Caught me off guard...
","Went in fairly blind, watched the original trailer a couple months back but that was it. All I knew was that it was creepy and was getting good critic reviews. And wow, it actually completely blew away my expectations! This film affected me in a way I have only felt after a few films(Jacobs ladder, Killing of a Sacred Dear, Sixth Sense) and it is a feeling of being deeply disturbed to your core. I went in believing the plot was going one way but it went in a completely opposite direction, there was nothing predictable about this movie besides maybe a few scares. I'd say its more mainstream than the witch but still retains an arthouse feel throughout. Creepy as hell, amazing acting, creepy score, beautifully directed. My only two cons of the film are that there are a few plot points that could have been explained further, and that one of the character's actions were frustrating and cliched(the dad). Besides that, its a perfect horror film.",9,4,8,22 June 2018
