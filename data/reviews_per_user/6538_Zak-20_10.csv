Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Formerly written for 17 year olds, now for 7 year olds
","I am not going to argue that the first trilogy to be released (of which the Empire Strikes Back was the best) was fully adult fare. However, there were relationship sensibilities and plot and dialogue that that were engaging to even someone over twenty. Most importantly, the characters had weight and there was a sense that the events portrayed came from a rich historical background.Unfortunately, here the sensibilities of all aspects of the film would be at par with a poor Saturday morning cartoon. Very disappointing. The Matrix was in all respects a far more superior SF movie.",3,0,2,26 September 1999
Meet the Parents," Funny moments, inconsistent tone and poor acting
",Ben Stiller just does not come across well as an earnestgood guy. At least the way he portrays himself in this movie.De Niro is good except when he drops out of character towards the end.Some solid chuckles though.,6,0,0,15 October 2000
American Beauty," Brilliant
","Very well done. Works in a space of movie-making that we rarely enter.Kevin Space does give his best performance ever.
Annette Bening is wonderfully crazed.
Disturbing, depressing and inspiring. Quite a feat.",10,0,0,26 September 1999
Mulholland Drive," Philip K. Dick meets Heidi Fleiss
","Layered dreams or alternate realities threaded together? If you want definitive answers you won't like this movie but if you appreciate the weighing of possibilities and the mists of perception, it does not get much better.",8,0,0,18 October 2001
The Insider," Infotainment on infotainment
","This dramatization of the cave-in of CBS News to the CBS corporate interests is very well done. Although it is a dramatization, the film leaves you with the feeling that they were in fact understated in describing the complicity of CBS News in suppressing a truly important news story. In the end it brings an interesting angle on the whole infotainment transition of the network news.",8,0,0,5 November 1999
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Very little of the charm of the first
","What was sweet and fresh in the first volume is now saccharine, and self-indulgent. A few subvocal chuckle-worth scenes and sly references that only the older among us will get. Special effects were so over the top and the heroes so clearly indestructible that they failed to impress, thrill any more than a first person shooter video game. It did not have to be this way but I am sure that like me the audiences were disappointed, if mildly entertained.",5,3,7,7 May 2017
The Matrix Reloaded," Disappointment
","First third of the movie was filled with pseudo-religious babble  (in contrast to Matrix I which was sparing with words and conveyed the religious allusions far more effectively). There is an extend music rave scene that looked like a bad MTV outtake.Up close to a large screen, during the multi-Mr.-Smith fight scenes Neo is clearly a computer synthesized character substituting for Mr. Reeves. Looked fake.Music in Matrix I was edgy. In Reloaded it is conventional and uninspiring. Did not drive me to buy the CD as the first did.The Neo character is invincible and so we are never really in any suspense.In the last third of the movie, it gets more interesting again.",7,0,0,16 May 2003
War of the Worlds," Works for this genre
","Given the constraints imposed by the original H.G. Wells novel, Spielberg and Cruise acquitted themselves very well. Entertaining and gripping without getting deep. I have not had this sense of satisfying made-for-Summer blockbuster experience for quite a while. Nonetheless, some images will stay with you. Some reviewers have commented with the resonance with national fears about 'outsiders' and changes to our status quo but this is still based on a pioneering 19th century yarn that defined the invasion genre.Those of us from Boston will particularly appreciate some of the landmarks that appear.Don't bring the kids though unless you want to deal with the subsequent nightmares.",8,2,5,30 June 2005
Happy Feet," Not for young children. Really
","Bambi had a serious ecological message. The current version of Charlotte's Web has serious themes and even the death of a major character. However these aforementioned moves do entertain even young children under four years. This movie will frighten and/or confuse these same children. I screened the movie and was I glad I did! Just having to avoid explaining the scene in the zoo of a despairing, hallucinating penguin to my children makes it worthwhile having endured this excruciating unsubtle rant of movie.What irks the most is the Title (yes, there were feet, but not happy) and the trailers and many of the so-called critics who really gave no clue of this unfortunate missing of the mark. C'mon! Only after the movie, did I google extensively for other reviews. On most sites, the paid reviewers wrote glowingly of this film and it's only through the user comments (such as those in IMDb) that anyone could figure out the unpleasant. Caveat emptor.",2,1,4,26 December 2006
13 Hours," Compelling story about a breed of American warrior with impressive beards.
","Beyond the facts and the larger political context of these events, what really sticks is the professionalism of these ex-military contractors. If indeed this is an accurate portrayal then this security team radiates the kind of deep experience and know-how that distinguishes the top of any profession. Several questions arise:a) Is it the case that all special ops or ex-special ops sport beards?b) Mortars seem low-tech and easily transportable and the most effective component that the locals used. Why did the attackers not use these from the start?c) Pretty interesting to see the use by the CIA of a drone for surveillance. If they could get a surveillance drone, why not one armament? Do those require top-level approval?",8,3,15,18 January 2016
