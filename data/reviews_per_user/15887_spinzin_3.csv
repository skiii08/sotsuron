Howl's Moving Castle," Fantastic..
","I wasn't too keen on watching this movie. I happened to be a major Christian Bale fan and I was searching for any movie of his that I hadn't seen. And, I found this. I was thinking, uh, its just his voice, how great can it be. But then, I had no other option! So I rented this to watch it and I was so impressed. Witty humor, excellent animation, wonderful music, and a spectacular story. What an imagination! From the mysteriousness of the wizard Howl to the breathtakingly bizarre moving castle of his, it was brilliant. Mayazaki truly is a genius. I would say, it is the Japanese Harry Potter. A MUST WATCH. I wished I hadn't missed it in the theater! hmph!",10,2,3,26 April 2008
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Disgrace to Hollywood and STAR WARS classics!
",the title says it all!!! a complete waste a good time in your life... it's actually worth watching the Empire Strikes back again on a mini TV than spending money in the theater for this one!!! I am not sure what else to write for this movie as IMDb does not allow the comments to be less than 10 lines... So I'm gonna repeat what I wrote earlier. the title says it all!!! a complete waste a good time in your life... it's actually worth watching the Empire Strikes back again on a mini TV than spending money in the theater for this one!!!

Terminator Salvation," what a show
","I can honestly say that this is one of the best actions movie I've ever seen. In fact, it is as good as Terminator 2: Judgment Day, HELL YEAH!Intense plot. Real good. Had some flaws, have to admit, but it was strong nonetheless. Everything connected and there was definitely an 'aaaah' moment and of course a 'wow, that rocks' moment.Great, with a capital G, acting! Christian Bale and Sam Worthington, the two main protagonists of the movie, put up one good show. The chemistry is just pure solace. Anton Yelchin, at first, I thought could not be the best choice to play Kyle Reese, who from what I remember from T1, was freaking hot. But, the dude actually pulled it quite well. (SPOILER AHEAD) Kinda makes you cry thinking that he is going to die soon (Back in T1, not this movie, duh!!)The action sequences, can't even begin to describe how good they were. What you saw in the preview, imagine that, but in a 2 hour preview! Have to admit, the first 20 minutes = Zzz. The next 1 hr and 30 minutes = I had too much terminator, eyes cannot close.Two disappointing things about this movie. a) the background score, what is up with that. Either there was no score, or it did not make a good impression on me for me to remember how it went! I am disappointed only with that. Hans Zimmer would have been a good choice, no questions asked! b) the ending. sorry, but I was hoping something else entirely. You would know when you see it. But even so, with this ending, the movie still rocked my day!So, my suggestion would be to catch this movie as quickly as you can! and make sure you learn your Terminator Trivia before doing so. You don't want to be bugging your friend about what Skynet is, like I was being bugged.",7,1,4,21 May 2009
