The Ring," It all depends on how you define the word 'Scary'...
","This movie offers me everything that I could possibly expect from a ghost story and more. A good plot line, a reasonably good amount of emotion from the characters and amazing camera works are just a few of the things that make this film so exceptional.If you ask me, the movie is frightening, not scary. It doesn't make you want to scream and run away while watching it. It just sends a shiver down your spine which I wouldn't say gave me a nightmare. It doesn't give you any cheap thrills but goes on with a vague presence of death and terror all along.The movie may seem a bit incomplete to a few people because the making of the Tape was never shown or even hinted towards. But I quite liked that part of the movie. Humans have been fascinated by the thought of ghosts from ages ago. We don't know how they work or what makes them tick. So withholding that bit of information from the audience is a well thought out idea.I could give the movie a 8 or 7, mostly due to it's overly clich√©d general outlook of it. But I suppose I'd just be lying to myself if I said that I didn't watch it at least 6 times. So, I award it a perfect 10.",10,1,1,7 October 2012
