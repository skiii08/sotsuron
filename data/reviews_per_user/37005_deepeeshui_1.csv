The New World," excellent movie
","history,love,passion,nature,culture,drama,all in one package. This movie was truly emotionally moving for those who would understand it. People who don't understand the true meaning of this movie its because they haven't lived it yet, but once they do they will appreciate it. Well, even thought it has different topics, the main one its love, its a historical love story that never dies. Everyone interprets this movie in different ways, the way I perceived it was that pocahontas had two man in her life, the one she loved and the one she appreciated. The one who awaken her innocence with passion and the one who made her a submissive common woman(wife,mother). Both men loved her and somehow she loved them too, but in different ways. Pocahontas never let go of her first love which it was captain smith, she may have gone insane for losing her true love at some point in time, but she faced reality by facing john smith at the end of the movie, she knew things weren't going to work out but she kept loving him until the end, the beautiful thing is that she was honest of how she felt about love with her husband john rolfe and he understood, because he loved her. Some people complain of how little wording was used in this movie, well the thing is that wording was not necessary, expressions says it all. If you want to know the true meaning of love, then I really recommend people to see this movie.",10,3,7,27 April 2007
