Requiem for a Dream," There are only two words needed to describe this film...
","... pure brilliance! Aronofsky is a true genius! After viewing this film, I was convinced that never before have I seen such an accurate and invigorating portrayal of addiction. The minute I had walked out of the theater I knew I had learned a life's lesson about using various drugs, and I knew that this was Aronofsky's goal.",Null,0,0,7 April 2001
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," KICK A**!!!!
","The movie was great and I thought that it beat the TV show ten to one. A funny movie indeed, I thought. The idea made me laugh, especially the Terrence and Phillip movie. All I could say is that it was great, and you have to watch it.",10,0,0,2 July 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," Kubrik has done it again!
","Kubrik has done it again! Despite the fact that some people call this movie disgusting and weird, I would just have to say that they haven't reached the level of maturity in movie viewing to be able to see Stanley Kubrik's genius. Not only is this film strong in conveying an interesting point but it is also highly entertaining to watch. Like all of Kubrik's films, Eyes Wide Shut opens the door to a new universe of understanding a subject, which in this case is sex. Every moment of the movie is filled with colorful themes that branch from that one part of our mentality concerned with love, affection, and last but not least lust. Kubrik presents the viewer with a variety of different sexual preferences and in the background shows how people, sometimes unknowingly, exhibit them through their behavior. At this point it should be mentioned that if you are viewer who is concerned about stuff like strong sexual content, nudity, etc., you should make an exception to see this movie in any case. Because although the MPAA does describe Eyes Wide Shut with these exact words, Kubrik simply used theses themes to deliver a more direct and powerful message (in which he highly succeeded). So in conclusion I highly recommend that you see this film, because it's one that you don't want to miss.",10,1,2,16 December 2000
Gladiator," A touch to the heart.
","Gladiator, directed by Ridley Scott, and starring Russell Crowe as Maximus Decimus Meridius, is one of the few movies that touches your heart leaves you with a beautiful vision of a time that has long ago passed by. Starting from the inspirational beginning, depicting Maximus as a leading general during Rome's hard fought battles with Germania, all the way to the face off between Maximus and emperor Commodus, the son of Marcus Aurelius (the last of the so called Five Good Emperors), this film provides the viewer with an entertaining representation of the Roman Empire. Gladiator captures your attention like no other movie in two different ways. Firstly, the highly original gladiatorial battles are very exciting and entertaining. (You will be kept at the tip of your seat. I guarantee it!). Secondly, a great part of the movie is devoted to the development of a wonderful and deeply emotional plot, which makes the ending very appropriate and one-of-a-kind. I would also like to add that, contrary to popular belief, Gladiator hold historical accuracy, in the sense that Commodus indeed was murdered by an athlete. In conclusion, I would like to recommend this movie to everyone! Regardless of your feelings for on-screen violence, I believe that you will enjoy this film. You will walk away with a new appreciation for freedom and family.",Null,0,0,25 December 2000
