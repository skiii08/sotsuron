Moneyball," Good Movie
","I thought this was a good movie...very plain however. It was all Brad Pitt here. The Jonah Hill praise was undeserved IMO. He was good, but not to the extent that he stole the film. It was Pitt's charisma that made this movie watchable. Without him, a very average and forgotten film. This is what star power does. His character's personality made the new system he was presenting believable. Most of the secondary characters were underdeveloped. His relationship with his daughter, though moving, needed more depth. I think was a very difficult film to storyboard and present...but it worked.Because the director blended a lot of actual film/video clips from the A's 2002 year, the movie had a strong documentary feel to it. I love doc films so no prob for me.",6,0,0,9 December 2011
Ocean's Thirteen," Snore
","Can you say WAY too much detail before anything really starts to happen? The magic of the first film is not here and both Pitt & Clooney seem distracted. There isn't the zest and chemistry the first film had and they both look old. Man, has Pitt aged since the first film.I didn't care for all the technique involved...give me story to hang onto. Instead of developing a good story and chemistry between characters, there was an overemphasis on setting up the heist with ridiculous detail at a fast pace. This is not good film-making and is exactly what happens when you have no real story, i.e. sequels that are past their prime.I didn't enjoy this film and nearly puked when all the actors stood together at the end watching the fireworks go off like in the first film standing together watching the water in front of the casino they just hit. Snore! The last scene was a joke...Pitt telling Clooney he shouldn't get so fat before they see each other again (Clooney gained weight for another movie) and Clooney to Pitt telling him to start a family and get some kids (Pitt got married to Jolie and adopted kids).Ha ha ha ha ... I hate cultural reference nobody will get in five years.",4,2,3,17 July 2007
Bridesmaids," Melissa McCarthy made this movie!
",Not since Tommy Boy did I laugh out loud so hard. Melissa McCarthy made this movie. Kristin Wiig is excellent and has more talent than most. She is confident enough to know not to overplay her character. Most comedy's today are a string of lousy sketches with the hope some type of theme will emerge...which rarely happens.Bridesmaids scores here with a decent little movie to boot. The director could have let Maya Rudolph show more of her comedic chops. She played things well under the radar. Jessica St. Clair nailed the beauty queen well with fine acting.See this movie...laugh out loud! If you are reading this director (and you really should) there is NO excuse for a bad movie today. Learn from the masters...craft a good story and allow your actors to make magic. We need good comedies in this world!,Null,0,2,4 October 2011
Drive," Blowback to the 70's and McQueen
","If you've seen Gosling in Fracture (excellent) it is hard to believe this is the same actor. Same with Christina Hendricks of Mad Men fame. Glad they played down her huge assets and let us see her act in a different role, which is why she probably took the part.Gosling plays a McQueen type character in the first part of the movie with subtlety using few words. This is much more difficult than most think to do. An actor has to really have confidence to pull this off. It would be like Neil Peart playing a solo on a 4 piece kit.One scene that was so simple and pulled me in was (SPOILER) during the pawn shop robbery. As the other car pulled into the lot, Gosling made a fist with his leather glove and the glove tensing into a tight fist was all you heard...brilliant! Bryan Cranston was good, but I saw a lot of his other characters in this role. He always defaults by playing the car salesman or looser guy in debt trying to always make another score.The music score was part 80's/part art fare...this was definitely not a Hollywood movie...reminded me of early Cohen Bro's.",Null,0,3,6 November 2011
Taken," One of THE BEST Thrillers in a long time!
","Neeson simply carried this film with a no nonsense kick ass approach. I have ALWAYS wanted an action hero to take charge in a realistic way (James Bond is too comic book, but Craig comes closest to what Neeson does here). I love the scene where he blasts first as he seeks answers from the scumbags.Maggie Grace was excellent in LOST and she plays the same role here, several years younger than her actual age, and she does it well. Until she grows out of the perfect 90210 looking babe, she will be typecast...but she has real talent so her time will come...unless she wants to do soap operas her entire life.SEE this movie if you have not. This crap is real and it happens in our world. A pretty face is a mixed blessing...maybe more a curse in the long run.Every father should own this movie, especially of a teen girl that's a looker.",9,1,4,6 September 2009
Jack Reacher," It's Official: Tom Cruise Jumped Shark!
","I'm not sure which is more disturbing, how bad this movie was or those who rated it above 1 star. There can only be one reason for this. Medical marijuana. They were all stoned out of their minds or 15yo boysbut even kids have seen enough movies by that age to know better. A Lifetime movie of the week looks like cinematic magic compared to this sad tale of an aging star looking for one more round of glory. Knowing the insecurity of TC, clearly he hired writers to come into IMDb and write reviews for probably 500 a pop. No drug could impair someone to write such dribble like, 'Cruise is back on top' or 'Best action movie ever.' Only TC would think 22yo women are ga-ga over his character as a 50yo actor! I kept thinking to myself, what are these women drooling over as Cruise walks into a bar or restaurant? He isn't 30 anymore! He is as old as these girls' father! Just pathetic.Seriouslythis is a BAD movie! Very bad movie. Bad. Bad. Bad. There is no excuse for this kind of thing. We have over 80 years of filmmaking behind our belts. If you rent any film noir movie from the 40's it is 100x better than this movie. If you rent the TV series Mission Impossible from the 60's, select any episode that was written and filmed in about 10 daysit will be 100x better than this movie. Go watch an episode of Everyone Loves Raymond and it will be better than this movie. Pet your dog and you will have more satisfaction. Did I mention how bad this movie was and is? This movie reflects the arrogance and death of Tom Cruise. Only someone who had this amount of control over a movie could screw it up so badly. If this was a TV series, then it might be acceptable because in a TV series you don't have to create character plots and build believability. This movie acts like we all know the relationships between key characters. They just 'get into it' and it does not work. You have to really have a good script and performances to pull that offthat ain't happening here. Any episode of Kojak from 1974 makes more sense than this movieand that is from someone who has never seen Kojak! This movie makes the same leap of faiththat the amazing performance of Tommy C will transport you to movie nirvana. Tomword outit ain't 1995. You're proverbial star has burned out. The couch jumping and crazy CScience crap only made you less marketable. Heck, I thought War of the Worlds was bad and that was the beginning of the end for you bud.I have not read any of Child's books and thought at first the badness of this movie (I want to keep writing the word bad) was because the Tom Cruise fire has burned out significantly over the past few years. That had to be it right? Maybe it was the fact that Rosamund Pike who looked to hot in Fracture back in 2007 aged so much? She was 5 months pregnant with her son Solo when she completed filming this piece of crap. Why hire a pregnant woman in an action movie? Maybe it was the terrible acting and writing? I figured this nightmare of a bad movie was going to kick in gear. It did not. It got worse! Tom Cruise is dead. His career is over. He had a good 25 year run. Made way too much money and seems like a pretty sad guy who can't admit he has a problem. Tomyou're 50 years old. It's over dude. Go fly your planes and read some L. Ron on the toilet. Waityou will bleed MI movies into the ground. Why? They suck as well. Just let it go TCand go back to your birth name, stop dying your hair, fix that huge nose and read a book.With the cable TV shows from HBO and others making most movies seem blah, Tommy's bad acting is now really exposed. I do not see this guy gaining any new ground as an older actor. He doesn't have the appeal. When you tried so hard to be a serious actor and your fire burns out, you have no place to go. Stallone created a caricature of himself in The Expendables. What does Tom do in 2020, make a spoof of Jerry Maguire? How about an updated version of Top Gun where TC plays grandpa of his hot shot grandson? In case I wasn't clearthis movie is HORRIBLE!!!!",1,15,34,21 April 2013
