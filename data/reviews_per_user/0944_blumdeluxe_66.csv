Blade Runner 2049," Great Pictures but not the Original
","'Blade Runner 2049' is a follow-up to the famous 'Blade Runner' movie and takes over its characteristics. It tells the story of a modern-day Blade Runner that one day stumbles over a long hidden secret and has to question his whole identity, leading to many unforeseen encounters and danger.The film is a visual masterpiece. Especially when you get to enjoy it on a larger screen you will almost instantly be drawn into the world and the futuristic surroundings. The general tempo of the movie is rather slow, so at no point events seem to be rushing, which keeps the film from being just another action adaption. On the other hand I have to say that the plot is not very surprising, it pretty much delivers what was expected from the film before, including a bit of fan service. Unfortunately, it seems that producers will try to establish a franchise out of this and air more parts of this series and this is where for me it is hard to believe that it is really for the benefit of the story any more, but rather for the dollars coming in, even though I don't doubt that there's enough story left for another decent part.All in all this is a very visual movie that isn't shaming its prominent ancestor, but it is also not a milestone or something that I would have need a third part of.",7,4,8,14 October 2017
Sucker Punch," Nice little Comic Action
","'Sucker Punch' is mainly based on action. It tells the story of a young girl, who is sent to psychiatry by her cold-hearted stepfather and learns to stand up for herself and others through a parallel world she creates.While it is surely not the greatest of its kind, the movie creates quite a nice atmosphere in my eyes, that makes it easy to arrive in the comic-like world the story is settled in. Though I'm not sure if the metaphors always work for me (I'm still kind of confused in how far who is involved and in charge), their concept surely is creative and, in a very simple conclusion, quite entertaining.I do understand why some might dislike the film, it has its weaknesses and especially for people that are more familiar with this genre there probably is a lot to at least discuss controversially. Nonetheless I can say that for me this works well for an entertaining evening and if you don't hope for much more you won't be disappointed.",7,2,4,14 March 2017
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," A movie for all the outcasts out there
","'The perks of being a wallflower' is a warm movie through all its cold and bitter moments and truths. It tells the story of Charlie, fresh to High School, who didn't have much luck with friends so far and who suddenly finds himself in a group of people he seems to belong to, yet it also causes him some trouble to really take a stand for himself.Of course you could argue that in some point the movie seems a bit like the typical Hollywood Popcorn cinema but I do believe that it carries on an important message. Maybe it can give hope to some lonely hearts out there and show them that wherever there are bad people, there are also some good around.As you can already see from my description, the film moves along a thin line between beauty and clich√© but I have to say that for me it stayed on the beautiful side more often and so, all in all, I do recommend to give it a try and see if you can draw something out of it.",8,0,1,23 January 2017
10 Cloverfield Lane," The ending ruined it for me
","'10 Cloverfield Lane' is a movie that keeps you guessing from the very beginning until almost the end. It tells the story of a woman that wakes up in an unfamiliar room after a car accident and has to decide whether it was a kidnapping or a rescue that brought her into this situation.In my eyes, the producers managed very skillfully to create an atmosphere in which you cannot tell, who to trust and what is the truth. Through several events, viewers get increasingly uncertain in what to think or even get lead on wrong paths. The small cast manages to interact with each other beautifully and thus gives some credibility to the almost bizarre scenario. Unfortunately, this is not how the movie was brought to an end. In my opinion, this could have been a very strong title, but then the aliens hit in. To tell it in advance, I really really really dislike when movies mix up reality and fiction. I don't have anything against neither, but when they intermingle, 99% of the time it doesn't work for me. As here. When I see how the lead character is chased by some alien creature, all of the tension that was built up during the plot just collapses. From that point on I'm more busy rolling my eyes than questioning what happens next. Maybe that's my own weakness but I really can't help the feeling.Now this is a strong movie still, it has some creativity and is much fun during most of its playtime. If you can cope with some fiction, you'll have a lot of fun with it. If not, maybe just stop at 2/3 and imagine an alternative ending.",6,0,0,28 May 2017
Source Code," A romance with a touch of Sci-Fi
","'Source Code' tells the story of a soldier, who awakens in a strange structure and is sent into parallel realities by a misterious army unit he hasn't heard before. They tell him, that his task is to prevent a terrorist attack on Chicago, in which millions of innocent people could be at risk. As time goes by, he notices, that he doesn't get all the information and that this program could implie a lot more than he originally thought.The film is overall very well done. It managaes to show the same scenery time and again without getting boring or become repetitive. There's an element of mystery and an element of action that I like really much. The weak part of the movie however is the sci-fi background of the plot. Where other films present believable conditions, this one really only has a wider thought of what technology could be used to achieve what the film depicts. That way the believability of the movie gets bent pretty much and in the end it feels a bit like some of the usual phrases of love and positivity have been pressed into a Sci-Fi plot. All in all this is a great realization nonetheless. It is based on some interesting thoughts, presents a thrilling plot and a lot of mysteries and is by far on the better end of technology romances.",7,0,0,10 April 2018
Catch Me If You Can," Worth a watch but not a must-see
","One of the most important things a film should offer its audience is surely a story worth being told. 'Catch me if you can' definitely achieves this. The story of a charming fraud, a young man that starts his career in crime out of desperation and boredom and achieves everything a regular man or woman can only dream of without really hurting anyone. The story of a most unlikely friendship between two men that play cat and mouse with each other for such a long period of time that they finally come to respect each other.While the story thus has a lot to offer, there are also some points that prevent this movie to really become a classic in my eyes. The characters, apart of DiCaprio's one appear a bit flat and one-dimensional and not much effort was put into their development. Some exaggerations further lead the way into a movie that's definitely entertaining, more so than many other blockbusters, but that in the end doesn't really leave a huge impact as well.Well worth a watch for an entertaining evening but not a must-see in my opinion.",7,1,2,4 December 2016
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Ages quite well
","'E.T.' is an all-time classic that deals with the extra-terrestrial E.T. who is left behind on planet earth by his species and meets Eliott, a young boy, who gives him shelter and helps him to make contact with his fellow friends.The movie ages quite well. All the cute and funny sequences still deliver the humor and heart that was put into the production. Even the special effects, that are by all means outdated, are carried out with enough care to avoid them from looking ridiculous. It is a typical case of a film settled somewhere between a children's movie, for which it is at parts quite scary, and a plot that adults can enjoy as well. The one thing that really bothered me was that for my taste too much cheesiness is woven into the plot. When E.T. is reanimated by Eliott's love for example, I can't help but feel that that's maybe a bit much. But otherwise this is still a movie you can enjoy with the whole family and one that had quite an influence on many people's childhoods.All in all you can't do much wrong by giving it a try, either as a reminiscence from your own childhood or as a classic that you shouldn't miss out on.",6,0,3,2 September 2017
Meet the Parents," Easy Humor
","'Meet the parents' deals with a young man who is supposed to meet the family of his girlfriend for the first time. As he arrives at the house of the seemingly wealthy elderly couple, a chain reaction of bad luck begins that lets him stand in very poor light before his girlfriend's family.This is a classic example of a Hollywood comedy aiming at larger audiences. The humor it works with is a very easy one, mostly slapstick, and takes up such a large amount of the film that it can be considered the dominating element. Some of the jokes work, some are rather dull, it's surely not fine humor. There are some logical errors but I guess those are not all too important in a movie like this one. I think that the film will work for many people, it is professionally produced and stars a lot of well known actors.All in all this is a solid comedy that doesn't deliver anything unexpected to make it a more special film. It is entertaining and doesn't get boring throughout all of its play-time, but your expectations shouldn't be too high.",5,0,1,1 October 2017
Coraline," Animated but dark
","'Coraline' tells the story of a young girl, who moves into an isolated old villa with her busy and non-caring parents, only to find out, that there is a better world awaiting her behind a secret door, where a different set of parents make all her wishes come true. As time passes by, however, this pittoresque picture begins to crack and the more sinister and dark side of her new parents begins to show. Will Coraline be able to escape into reality before it is too late?Before starting the movie I pretty much expected just another animated movie that would deliver an entertaining but not exactly outstanding plot. But soon I noticed that this film is remarkably different from most of the genre. Its tone is set way darker and some of the elements remind more of a horror movie than one for children. I really like that producers were brave enough to try something new and thus show that making films abroad the main paths is still possible. I wouldn't watch it with small children but otherwise I fully recommend it.All in all you can absolutely make nothing wrong with giving this movie a try. However, you should not expect a happy, colorful firework but a serious and sometimes frightening film.",10,0,0,26 April 2018
The Impossible," Impressive story with a lot of Hollywood
","'Lo imposible' tells the story of a family on vacation in Asia when a tsunami hits the coast, seperating them and leaving them on a desperate search for each other in a destroyed land.The film is based on historic happenings, in fact many viewers will still remember the terrible floods that hit South-East Asia around 15 years ago. It looks a bit clean in the beginning and paints a stereotypical Hollywood picture of a happy hard-working family but once the catastrophe starts to unroll, producers managed quite skilfully to catch and portray the emotions that such a dramatic series of events necessarily evokes. There are not huge twists or surprises, rather it's just what you would expect from a major production that deals with recent catastrophe. Which isn't always a bad thing because it means a professional production, decent acting and powerful images but it also has its downsides.All in all this is a more than solid approach to this topic that delivers a powerful story and makes you thankful for the life you have. It could have been a bit more rough and less Hollywood in my opinion but that's a question of taste.",7,1,2,25 May 2019
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Blockbuster with heart
","'Crazy, Stupid, Love' begins like one of these typical Hollywood comedies. A couple that's about to divorce, a man exploring himself, a dysfunctional family, nothing we haven't seen a thousand films about already.And in a way it is one. It convinces through a massive cast, throws with cheesy monologues and 'Aw'-moments. But that's just half the story. This movie is more. Not only is it actually quite funny, much more so than many of the comparable films, it also develops a very intermingled plot that leads into a both absurd and beautiful ending.The characters are likable, maybe not very multidimensional, but still somewhat heart-warming. There are some pearls in the soundtrack and small gags in the right spots. Sure, there are also features that are a bit too much the typical cinema release and in many ways, 'Crazy, Stupid, Love' is not a very creative film.But nonetheless I really liked it. While I was still a bit unsure during the first half, the second half could even increase the paste a bit and entertained me just as I hoped for. Nothing to change your mind or worldview. But something to change your evening or mood maybe.",7,1,2,21 February 2017
The Danish Girl," Weird display of transsexuality
","'The Danish Girl' tells the story of the first woman ever to experience the change into her body through operational measures. It shows how a Danish painter and husband recalls long-hidden feelings and finds the strength to stand up for his wish to get a female body, including all that means for his relationship and his beloved ones.First of all it is great that this movie evoked awareness for the feelings of transsexuals and I think that the given biography is more than worth being displayed on the screen. However, I didn't really get warm with this film and this is mainly because I find the display of Lily's transsexuality rather odd. The way it is displayed is really a bit schizophrenic, which transsexuality is clearly not. But I can't imagine any transsexual completely neglecting events or losing certain capabilities like the capability to draw just because they currently switched their gender, which is by the way also not how this works, because transsexuality doesn't transfer you into another person, it just adjusts your body to the person you are. This way, I found it rather hard to follow the film because it seems to be based on a difficult understanding of how transsexuality works, even though the actors delivergreat performances and the overall production value of the film is worthy without question. All in all I would have wished for less Hollywood scripted emotions and more real ones, a more sinister approach to how transsexuals, to make this film as great as its intentions.",7,0,1,17 May 2018
127 Hours," A lot of potential, some of it unused
","Since this movie is based on true events, which went through the media during the time, the plot of it should already be common knowledge even before watching it. A story of human will to survive and severe sacrifices, 127 hours has a lot of potential to tell an extraordinary story.In many points, it achieves this potential in keeping you cautious and giving you an impression how grave it must be to be caught in the middle of such a hopeless scenario. Unfortunately I feel like it gives up on some further potential because the overall tone could be a bit darker. By presenting large shots of the outer valley or detailed descriptions of the main characters dreams, the producers pull you out of this otherwise desperate situation. But exactly this situation is what makes this movie so strong. I would have wished for an attempt to keep you caught there, maybe not referring to his inner state of mind as much as his bare physical presence to really give you an impression of how all hope slowly gets lost in this spot.That would have made the movie terrible in matters of physical pressure, but isn't that what it is in the end: A terrible situation? Nonetheless this is a film worth a watch and it does make you overthink your priorities to a certain amount. But I would have wished for a more adult attempt at the topic.",7,1,1,21 December 2016
Orphan," For strong minds only
","'Orphan' tells the story of Esther, a young girl who gets adopted by a couple that already has two children but lost a third one during birth. After a short period of time things start to become increasingly uneasy with rumors of Esther hurting other children and showing some obsessive behavior.I really have to say that the film manages perfectly to build up an atmosphere that is at some points hard to bear. Of course the plot itself is not massively innovative, adopted children who are in some ways dangerous or weird are one of the corner-stones of the Horror-genre. But still in this case the story line is so carefully set up that 'Orphan' is easily one of the best attempts on this popular theme. What's kind of unnecessary in my eyes is that Esther is supposed to be an adult in the end because the story would have worked out perfectly fine with her just being a child with psychological problems, but I appreciate that at least they found a more realistic solution and didn't invent some evil demon that haunts the family.All in all this is a should-see if you like Horror films and don't have a weak heart. Grab some popcorn and your loved-ones and enjoy an evening of thrills.",7,1,2,4 September 2017
L.A. Confidential," A solid police/mafia piece
","'L.A. Confidential' tells the story of the Los Angeles Police Department back in the days, when officers were hugely involved in crime. When a new officer enters the department, some of the long hidden deals come to light and cause big trouble.What you see is what you get in this film. It convinces with a prominent cast, solid filmmaking and a good look, however it is rather a solid police tale than it is a groundbreaking story. In the tradition of well-known mafia movies, it tells the same story from a different perspective. Entertaining but not breathtaking.All in all this is a very solid crime movie, focussing on a corrupt police. The heart of this movie are the actors themselves, otherwise this is a solid Hollywood Blockbuster.",7,0,2,7 March 2019
Concussion," When Hollywood meets Sports
","'Concussions' tells the story of a Nigerian doctor who comes to the United States and works in the pathology. When a few formerly famous football stars land on his table, he notices some strange connections between them and learns that the sport everybody is so crazy about could be far more dangerous than one expects.It is a tremendous story based on real happenings. For the important message alone, it is a huge win to have this film shot with a high budget and a remarkable cast. Unfortunately, the side effects of this high production value are that the movie follows the basic Hollywood principles. The story is surely worth being told but it is dramatized and interwoven with personal emotions in a way that sometimes seems to have been created mainly for the big screen. This way the sports plot gets a touch of American dream and becomes the tale of an unsung hero, that occasionally comes a bit too close to the mainstream.All in all this is an important movie produced in a way that makes it look like most Blockbusters. Worth a watch but it misses out on some potential as well.",7,1,2,19 November 2017
The Terminator," Solid but not more
","'The Terminator' tells the story of a killing machine that was sent into present times by other machines in their war against humanity in order to kill the mother of the leader of the human rebellion. Unprepared, the young woman has to fight for her life side to side with a friend of her future son to save the future of humankind.The film was a bit more serious than I feared it would be, it has elements of a dystopia and some kind of theory for the background of the plot, even if that is not always brilliantly thought-through. For this reason it doesn't exclusively consist of action, which is a definite plus. The effects aged rather well and even today don't look embarassing. Unfortunately I have to say that in terms of plot and dramaturgy the film is at best mediocre. What it tells is more or less an episode, like a scene of a movie that is enlarged into a whole production. That leads to a Terminator that has so many lives that it is on the edge of being ridiculous. I would have loved to see a bit more background and future times rather than fighting sequences that don't take an end.All in all this isn't just a movie of action and destruction, even though many scenes include both. Through solid acting and a somewhat consistent story it becomes an okay film that aged rather well and is widely considered a classic.",6,3,7,16 January 2019
Silent Hill," Could have been a better movie
","'Silent Hill', a game adaption, tells the story of an adoptive mother, who brings her daughter to a town she keeps talking about in her sleep. Once there, she loses her tracks and has to experience that this town keeps some secrets that had better be kept buried.First of all, I haven't played the game, so I really can't tell if the film suits them. However, I like the general topic very much, where the girl keeps screaming the name of the town and the two of them experience horror once they arrive there. What I didn't like so much were all the creatures. For me, a more subtle kind of horror that focuses more on the humans and the girl would have created an even scarier atmosphere, than some fantasy demons arising from nowhere. That's why, in my opinion, the second part of the movie with the church kind of saved the film from becoming just another monster splatter. In some of the situations it is easier to adopt than in others, which makes it hard to give a homogeneous overall experience.All in all this isn't a bad movie but it could have been way better if some of the monster action would have been transformed into something more subtle. I see potential, though.",5,1,3,11 July 2017
Hotel Rwanda," Puts a conflict on the map
","'Hotel Rwanda' tells the story of a local hotel manager, who becomes a hero when he lets countless refugees, whose lifes are at stake, stay in the hotel in order to save them from persecution during the civil war in Rwanda. At the same time he has to face the destiny of his own little family and learns the hard way that his country is not within the western focus.In many ways this is a typical Hollywood production and it sure doesn't push barriers in terms of filmmaking. But what it does is putting a conflict on the map that most westerners barely know as a news headline and giving both the victims and their persecutors a face. In times like these it is ongoingly important to be remembered how absurde and horrifying war really is and also what responsibility lies upon every one of us in order to do what is within his posssibilities to do good. The main character here is not an angel, he has his own interests, trades with the worst people and prioritizes. But when he was needed he took action and saved many. It also shows that such people need help and that we as westerners have possibilities to grant it to them but too often don't care enough to do so.All in all this is a movie with an important message and some very intense scenes, not a gamechanger artistically but a strong film.",8,0,0,12 January 2019
Over the Top," Moral high grounds
","'Over the top' tells the story of a strong and independent trucker, that all of a sudden gets a chance to meet his long lost son. Unfortunately, the boy has been raised in the high society and has a tough time accepting his dad. Will they be able to find together?There's so much moral in this movie that you feel like after a preach once you've finished. It's rebellious without rebellion, confronts the high society without losing them and thus remains pretty harmless. The son is like out of a cartoon and quite exhausting. Otherwise it is a well-known story, solidly told and entertaining enough to keep you from boredom most of the time, even though you can feel the age.All in all a little less important messages would have suited the film well and more plausible and multidimensional characters would have done the rest. As it is it is an okay film, but you have to be a fan to really fully enjoy it.",4,0,3,28 April 2019
Full Metal Jacket," The ugly face of war
","'Full Metal Jacket' tells the story of a few young men who join the military, get their drill by a merciless instructor and finally reach Vietnam, where they find themselves in the middle of a nasty war.In its dialogues, the movie finds a good balance between more humorous parts and the seriosity that is needed to deal with such a topic. The situations feel very plausible and you soon begin to develop empathy for the young men. The soundtrack sometimes didn't underline the actions perfectly, but that is just my personal opinion, I know that some find it very suiting. It is not the kind of movie that leaves you destroyed but it quite skillfully portrays how senseless people are willing to kill each other.All in all this is not the best of its genre for me but it is a beautifully produced question, that lets its audience search for an answer. Maybe not something you must have seen but it sure adds another perspective to this topic.",8,2,2,8 August 2018
Fargo," Classic Coen
","'Fargo' works as most Coen movies. It develops a plot without any hectic, though much happens, it is almost harmonic and silent. What takes place here is more storytelling than the attempt to produce a crime film. While developing likable, odd characters, what is told here is basically not a sensational story. It has by far less twists than Burn after Reading for example and yet it makes for a good movie.Unlike others, I don't consider this the best Coen title, I liked both Burn after reading as well as A serious man better. Nonetheless it is in itself a piece of art and you have to admire the Coens for having such a unique signature that you can almost from the first minute tell it is one of their films.All in all, give it a try but don't expect wonders.",8,0,1,12 January 2017
Rush," Not only for motorsports fans
","'Rush' tells the story of the Austrian race pilot Nikki Lauda and his biggest rival in the racing scene. It depicts a time when every race could possibly be the last one for many pilots and how differently the men tried to cope with this fact.I'm really impressed by this movie because it lives up to its good critics. The focus here is not so much the sports even though it plays a huge role of course but rather the portrayal of two very different men and their complicated relationship with life and each other. The acting is done greatly and even though it looks like your typical blockbuster in many ways, it's always a bit more than that. Even though I only have basic knowledge of the formula one, I was pleased to see a racing-based film that shows more than just the typical story of an outsider making it to the top.All in all this is a great example of how sensitive and empathic filmmaking can form a strong story and make audiences question own decisions without becoming boring or pretentious. A definite recommendation.",9,1,3,15 January 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," Portrayal of a special man
","'Bohemian Rhapsody' tells the life-story of Freddie Mercury and his band Queen. It follows the singer through difficult personal and business decisions, depicts the relationships with real and false friends and sets a monument for a quite unusual band.As someone who isn't an expert on Queen, even though some of the songs are universally known, the movie helped me to better understand the phenomenon and develop a new point of view on some of the songs. The only thing I found really strange is the choice of a starting and ending point for this film, since it tells nothing about the childhood and ends with a rather randomly chosen concert. The portrayal is impressive but the focus is also laid widely on the music, which makes perfect sense but for me kind of limits the biographical aspects.All in all this is still a very powerful film that fans will love and others will at least repsect. It tells the story of an unusual life, celebrates brave decisions and visualizes the memories of millions of fans all over the world.",7,1,1,6 March 2019
Bird Box," A bit lazy
","'Bird Box' tells the story of a mother who has to save her two children by blindly leading them to a safe space after a mysterious force makes people lose their mind and kill themselves through eye-contact.I honestly don't get why this is such a big hit. It is, to be fair, absolutely not my genre but I really find this movie a bit lazy. Not only is it hard to emphasize with a woman so harsh even under the given conditions but more important, major parts of the plot never actually get explained. Throughout all of the scrren time people are being terrorized and killed by a force that stays totally anonymous until the end. There isn't even the slightest try to explain what's behinf it or what happened. I'm not a big fan of demons and evil spirits but it's even worse when nobody even tries to make sense of it. Otherwise the plot is okay, it doesn't have huge lengths but neither does it have true peaks.All in all I'm maybe not the best person reviewing this film regarding my personal taste but I do think that it is fair to expect a bit more than is delivered by this movie. I've heard that it's supposed to be some kind of allegory to the parent-child relations nowaday, which is something, but I think I would have prefered a different approach.",5,1,4,12 January 2019
Watchmen," I guess I should've read the comics first
","I am one of the folks who really didn't have a clue about the Watchmen before giving this movie a try and I have to say that I am, at least, confused now.This is clearly a film for the fans more than for a wider audience, which is basically totally fine but of course limits the audience. After two and a half hours of playtime, I still don't have any idea what exactly makes most of the characters different from the surrounding humans apart from wearing a cape. While I'm totally aware and agree that not every comic movie can recap the whole basis it is founded on because that would be pretty boring for anyone who is familiar with it already, I do believe that in such a long movie, one that is the first in its series, you should find time to at least roughly explain around what the series is settled.'Watchmen' is not a bad movie by any means but honestly it's also not a great one. The milestones of the plot aren't very shocking or moving to me and the action around them is nothing that hasn't been seen in several similar films already.In my opinion some of the characters do have great potential and some elements of the movie, like the score for example, were brilliantly executed.Nonetheless it would be fair to make clear that people like me are not the aimed audience. A solid, but not a superb movie.",6,2,4,22 February 2017
Split," A bit overrated in my eyes
","'Split' is definitely one of the movies that people were talking about lately. It provides a story that's designated to make the audience curious. Three teenage girls, kidnapped by a man with plenty of personalities that is struggling with himself, thereby setting the girls at deadly risk.The general concept is really promising. And to not get me wrong, this is by far not a bad movie. Some of the acting was brilliantly done and it would be a lie to say that you aren't excited how things will go on.But there are things that prevent me from rating it better. Firstly, at time sit just tried to be a bit too much of a comedy for my taste. There were scenes that made people burst out in laughter and that kind of ruined the atmosphere of danger and risk. Of course these could be unintentional but in this case they are just not thoughtfully overthought. But most important, why did there have to be kind of a paranormal plot twist? This could have been a beautiful realistic thriller but at the point where knives just break and bullets can't kill anymore the movie just lost me. That's just ridiculous and ruins an otherwise well-made thriller. Maybe that's too harshly said but it really disappointed me. I also fear there will be a second part and I don't see how the film could benefit from that.So all in all it is a good movie, no questions asked, I don't regret watching it and if you are not too keen on realism I don't see why it shouldn't please you as a thriller fan. I will just stick to other titles.",6,1,9,5 February 2017
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," More than you'd expect
","'Terminator 2: Judgment Day' is the second part of the Terminator series, telling the story of the original Terminator, protecting Sarah Connor and her son from a new version android, sent to eliminate the leader of the future rebellion.To be honest, I didn't really expect much from this sequel. Terminator itself was a solid movie but not extraordinary and so I thought that part two would pretty much deliver the same. However, I have to say that I am hugely impressed by how serious the producers took their own film. While the plot itself is rather disposable indeed, a lot of ethical and moral questions are interwoven into it, making this a film that formulates questions for a future world. Especially this aspect seperates the movie from others of the same genre that otherwise would be very similar. The good production and look additionally does no harm.All in all I can really recommend giving this a watch not only for fans of sci-fi and destruction, but also for those who like to spend some thoughts on the future of themselves and humanity in general.",7,1,3,7 March 2019
Edward Scissorhands," A parabola
","'Edward Scissorhands' tells the story of a young man, created by a scientist, whose creator died before he could give him real hands. Now he lives on a dark castle with scissors as hands, until a friendly lady from the neighboring town invites him to live with her family. Newly invited into the conservative community, problems begin to arise.You can clearly see that this film is supposed to serve as a parabola rather than a realistic plot. It succeedsin creating great emotions towards the main character and his fateful love for the daughter of the family. Personally, I didn't like the set design all too much, but that's just a question of preferences and you can clearly see the typical Tim Burton style shimmering through. The story is not really creative or innovative but it is told nicely and the acting is great.All in all this is not a must-see but it can serve as an example what exclusion can cause in people and how we are all responsible for creating a society that is worth living in.",7,1,1,9 July 2018
American History X," The power of education
","'American History X' tells the story of a young man who sees himself as a neo-nazi and is one of the key players of the local scene. When he is sent into jail, slowly his beliefs begin to be questioned as he meets the people he used to hate so much and gets to know them better. Back in freedom, his younger brother wants to take the same path of right-wing gang membership and to change his mind won't be easy.In many ways this is a tremendous movie. It shows the power of education, that what we pass on to our children can influence their whole lives and even political beliefs. On the other hand it depicts how getting to know people instead of just talking about them can change your mind on how to interact with them. Futhermore, it is also a portrayal of a dysfunctional family, that struggles with death and disease. Unlike other reviewers, I sometimes would have wished for the moral of the film to be a bit more subtle. It is important to stand up loud against xenophobia, but it makes the film a bit easy to attack. Also, unfortunately, not all right-wing followers are just young and confused kids, we need to take them seriously in order to stop them.All in all this is an outstanding film concerned with a very important issue. Not my personal favorite in terms of the filmmaking side but that's just a question of taste since it is carried out more than professionally.",8,0,0,24 September 2018
Saw III," It starts to worsen
","'Saw III' brings back the Jigsaw killer, this time so weak that he has to kidnap a doctor to keep him alive while his obsessed assistant prepares a final game with a man who lost everything when his son got killed during a car accident and seeks revenge for it.Unfortunately, this part is not nearly as good as the first two have been. It is still a solid movie, don't get me wrong, but it feels a bit like the producers are desperately trying to bring in elements of surprise which doesn't work out as well as it did before. Instead, there are several backflashs that make it sometimes hard to keep up with the story and the stringency that was a center-piece of the first two parts, goes missing at least partly. What you get is still a dark and sinister thriller that keeps you entertained but it sometimes tries to hard to be a Saw movie.All in all you do nothing wrong by giving this a try but you should know that you can't expect something as carefully balanced as the other parts of the series.",6,1,1,17 August 2017
Days of Thunder," Classic Sports Movie
","'Days of Thunder' tells the story of a young and hungry NASCAR driver, who competes for honor and glory and has to learn the hard way that speed and fame can have an enourmous price.I'll set aside the fact that noone should cast Tom Cruise anymore and just talk about the film itself. It is pretty much a classic sports drama, evolving around a few ambitious drivers who give each other a hard time, realize what's important in life but can't really let go their addiction for speed. Nothing spectacular, but very solid filmmaking with some touching and honest moments. Maybe more Hollywood than reality but it has its moments.All in all you can give this film a watch, it has somehow shown to be a Sports classic by now. It doesn't set new standards or surprise but it delivers a solid performance.",7,0,2,2 June 2018
It Follows," Nice atmosphere but the story?
","I have to admit that most of the time I'm not the biggest fan of horror movies which probably makes me a bad judge.Nevertheless I gave this one a try and I have to say that I felt entertained. The movie understands well to create an atmosphere that makes it easy to get drawn into the actions portrayed. Like other horror movies, it plays nicely with features like camera angles, sounds and filters.The reason I rate this as a five is thus not the overall atmosphere of the movie, which I appreciate or the solid acting, it is the implausibility of the story. Maybe the story isn't the most important point in a horror movie but for me being afraid is closely linked to the feeling that something similar could happen or that there is at least a plausibility in what happens. In this case there are a lot of questions but barely any answers. What is 'it', What does it want, How did it start? We don't know. Why do you get rid of it by sleeping with someone? We don't know neither.Who does know is the boy in the beginning, who seems to have a wide knowledge of aspects like what happens when a victim gets caught (It traces back the other victims, how did he know?). As hard as it might sound but the story is just nonsense and that's what ruins a beautiful atmosphere for me here.",5,0,2,21 December 2016
Kick-Ass," Outstanding
","'Kick-Ass' is one of the reasons why it is still so much fun to explore new movies over and over again. It tells us the story of an average boy who chooses to become a real-life super hero, thereby starting a chain of incidents that lead him to a place he could never have imagined.This film is not just another one you can fit into a scheme perfectly. It rather does actually bring some new and refreshing elements on the table. If the studios really all wanted Hit Girl to be 19 or older, they really didn't get the soul of the film I guess. Not only is the acting overall excellent, the director also proves a good sense of humour on the way.You could argue that 'Kick-Ass' is a bit longer than the average film and that maybe there would have been options to cut it down a bit without hurting the story, but nevertheless it never gets to the point of being boring and a remarkable soundtrack helps to keep your focus on the screen.I really liked the film though. If you're not afraid of explicit violence and open-minded, this is definitely a should-see. It's not only a homage to the comic genre, it is indeed a piece of art itself.",9,1,2,13 February 2017
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Cheesy Vampires
","'The Twilight Saga: New Moon' is the second part of the Twilight movies and tells how Bella increasingly suffers from Edwards attempt to hold her distant while building a closer connection to Jacob. The story culminates in Edward attempting to kill himself and a trial before the first of vampires.In many ways, this is just a regular Hollywood movie. To a certain extent I even like how the idea of vampires and werewolves is transferred to a more modern surrounding. Unfortunately, the film is drowned in a bulldozer-load of kitsch that sometimes threatens to turn the scenes into something funny because you can't take them serious anymore. Nonetheless there is a coherent plot that is interesting enough to carry the movie until the end. I'm not so hooked that i have a feeling of immediately watching the third part but I think that a lot of reviews here are written more in a sense of simply hating than as a serious critique.All in all you should only watch this if you can cope with a very teen-aged ideal of love and romance. What you get is not a highlight but it is a solid film and there are worse.",6,0,0,7 August 2017
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," A tale of love and death
","'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' tells the story of Benjamin Button, who is born as an old man and develops back into his childhood. While he never seems to fully fit in, he finds love and loses it again, lives through adventures and learns from them.In my opinion, this movie is one of the rare extraordinary tales of love that modern Hollywood cinema produces. I don't know if there's a connection to the novel about Max Tivoli, that seems oddly similar but as this novel it delivers a great plot, that has a great potential to mirror society and show how age defines both our character and the way we are seen by others. It is especially the desperation of evolving in different directions, that makes this movie so valuable. Personally, I would have liked it to be maybe half an hour shorter, even if I can't say what to cut out, but in the end it did feel a bit long. But I can easily live with that if I get such a beautiful story in exchange.All in all this is a beautifully produced and played Hollywood tale, that depicts the true character of love in all of its aspect and in great truth. Definitely a film worth being watched.",9,0,0,18 September 2018
Pawn Sacrifice," A bit incoherent
","'Pawn sacrifice' centers around the life and game of one of the greatest chess players of all time, Bobby Fischer, and his battle with both the cold war and his fragile mind. It thereby mainly focuses on the events of the World Championship in Reykjavyk.In my opinion, the biggest strength of the movie becomes also its biggest problem. The attempt to create a balance between cold war, Fischer's mind and chess sometimes fails a bit. While much screen time is used to portray the events of Iceland, his breakdown afterwards and the questionable views he expressed are only mentioned very briefly. Somehow the movie still tells this story as an American hero tale, the Soviets are still the bad guys and all in all you can't help but say that this is a quite patriotic movie. I think that taking his whole life into account would have helped to understand better what happened to this man. It is indeed sad to see a brilliant mind fall to very dumb ideas and turn into somebody you need to oppose.As it is, the movie is very much one in a row of movies showing us how pressure in sports or art can break people. Despite all my criticism it is still a good movie, thoroughly produced and the person of Fischer surely delivers enough aspects to turn this into an interesting film. One that is solid, but also one that could be even better.",7,1,1,30 April 2017
Children of Men," As depressing as close to reality
","'Children of men' is one of the few movies that manage to create an image of the future that has proved to be not too far away from how reality could look like. In fact one of the greatest strengths of the film for me is, that it establishes a rough and dirty image of a future world that still has enough in common with reality to make it believable. There are no hover-boards or air-crafts flying around, no stylish future-items or anything, just a degree of progress that you would easily accept. Of course it missed some of the things that actually have established by now but I guess the technical development of the past few years was a very rapid one. Also I find it one of the more believable options of apocalypse that infertility somehow gets common.Sadly, in some parts the movie is already not too far away from reality nowadays. We do see the strong desire to re-establish nationalism in many countries, including methods like building walls and gathering people to bring them out of country. The general mood towards refugees gets rougher as their numbers increase. I instantly had to think of phenomena like the jungle in Calais and felt strongly reminded.As for the story it is a solid one, nothing spectacular but it kept me entertained. The characters weren't the deepest ones I've ever seen but neither were they unbearably flat, so I was pretty satisfied. The only thing that I really don't believe is that all of a sudden everybody forgets about the baby and they can escape. I mean it is literally not far away from seeing ghosts in such a situation. You wouldn't just turn around and keep fighting, at least I had wished for a more plausible reason.Nonetheless, 'children of men' is an excellent film. If you haven yet to give it a try, do so. It is maybe more current than ever.",9,1,1,2 April 2017
Saw II," A second part that's actually good
","My expectations towards 'Saw II' naturally weren't the highest. There have been too many plain stupid second parts of successful movies to be all too excited about them. I especially feared, that the splatter element of the series could become dominant and thereby force the more thought-through thriller elements in the background.Luckily I can say that didn't happen and more so, I am even pleasantly surprised about how much I liked the second movie. Yes, it is not as fast and steadily thrilling as the first part, there are sequences that seem a bit long and make you ask yourself whether this couldn't be shortened. But especially the end, that at least I didn't see coming, makes up for these scenes and gives the whole story a new dimension and plausibility.I know that 'Saw' has developed into a quite controversial series. Many people seem to dislike it, even more so when it comes to the later parts. But for me, if you let go of some minor mistakes like quite lucky timing etc., 'Saw' unites many of the aspects I'd like to see more frequently even in less brutal or spectacular thrillers. The series was a commercial success. But for me at least the first two parts are seriously underestimated when it comes to their quality.",8,0,2,20 March 2017
Paranormal Activity," Not much horror
","'Paranormal Activity' tells the story of a young couple haunted by a demon. While they do everything to get rid of their supernatural housemate, the events worsen and get more serious.The movie is filmed in the style of an amateur recording, which makes almost anything look more scary than it actually is. This is probably a good thing considering that during most of the film not much happens at all apart from moving doors or some screams. During the second half the events become a bit more serious and the plot is more solid there but this is definitely not something that will keep an experienced Horror fan awake for the upcoming nights. Otherwise this is your average demon story, produced in a solid yet unspectacular way.All in all this is okay demon horror. You can give this a try if you're looking for entertainment and don't set your standards all too high.",5,0,0,17 August 2017
Annie Hall," Woody Allen
","'Annie Hall' is what you consider a typical Woody Allen movie, although he'd probably hate this classification. It centers around the concept of love and human relationships, expectations, fears and needs. In the typical mixture of comedy, drama and stylistic elements we follow a couple falling in love and growing out of it, learning about themselves through the other.I really like how unconventional this movie deals with the topic. A movie about love and relationships is really not on top of innovation, yet it feels like this film has a sense for the undertones of love. In many ways philosophical, it raises questions and searches for answers, not always finding the right ones maybe but matching the complexity of human relationships.I found it interesting to learn that Allen himself doesn't think highly of this film. Indeed I also liked other of his films, especially 'Whatever works' more, that seemed to be even more on point to me. 'Annie Hall' sometimes takes quite a lot of time to make a point and at times gets lost in itself.Nonetheless this is a movie you should see. It leaves you with a lot to think about.",8,2,4,18 April 2017
Avatar," Very ambitious but no outstanding plot
","'Avatar' tells the story of a soldier who replaces his dead brother in an avatar program built to examine and influence a foreign species on a foreign planet. As he learns more and more about their life and culture, he begins to question the motives of his bosses and switches sides.You can only honor all the visual effort and work that wys put into this film. I didn't watch it on a big screen but I can imagine that it is an overwhelming experience, visually. Unfortunately, I have to say that the plot is not equally convincing. What you get is more or less a story told several times before packed in a mediocre action movie. Some of the cultural aspects reach a bit beyond that but all in all this could well be your average action title wasn't it for the immense budget and effects.All in all it is still worth a watch because it was a milestone in filmmaking and develops its magic from time to time but it is not as big a movie as you would expect it from such a production.",6,1,1,11 February 2019
Saw," Better than most Thrillers
","When you hear about Saw, what comes up straight into your mind are images of a splatter movie, celebrating violence without worshiping the plot too much. In my opinion that is a completely false judgment.To me, the movie is a classical psycho-thriller rather than a Horror movie actually, even though the borders are naturally fluent. What I really liked is how much thought is put into when to release which information. I can honestly say that I didn't predict many of the details that came to light, including the excellent end.Of course the movie gains some of its success from the language of violence it carries, but honestly, there's nothing so bad in it, that you couldn't have seen it a dozen times before. And in part the degree of violence helps to create an atmosphere in which the audience can really feel the desperation of the protagonists grow.In my eyes, this is a better approach towards an excellent thriller than many others I've seen lately. I respect the mixed critics but recommend a watch if you're okay with seeing explicit images.",8,1,5,10 January 2017
Stalingrad," Well produced but..
","'Stalingrad' tells the story of a group of German soldiers in the Second World War that begin their journey in Italy and later find themselves trapped in the cold Russian winter, surrounded by enemies.There are many things to like about this film. The production looks very professional, the acting is fine and the film manages very good to show what an emotionally extreme situation this winter was for the average soldier. However, it is a bit misleading how they all turn their backs on nazism and more or less become heroes throughout the film. The truth is that far too few, almost none German soldiers at all turned their backs on the Nazis. And it is also false to act like only a few top-Nazis sent thousands of innocent soldiers to war, many of them were very convinced of the ideology themselves, did horrible things and were happy to fight for the Nazis.All in all, this is a well produced and carried out movie that surely leaves you with a solid wish for peace in the world, however it gives a rather positive picture of the German army, that historical facts don't really support.",7,1,4,28 March 2020
Sicario," Overrated
","Unfortunately, I can't share the enthusiasm with which some others here review this movie. While I do agree that the plot-line is quite clever and that you don't really guess what will be revealed in the end, there are mainly two major issues that kind of ruined the film for me.The first thing is that I find the characters quite unbelievable. With the exception of Benicio del Toro maybe, all of the characters remain flat. There is an agent that is supposed to carry out the toughest missions and worst crimes imaginable, that is, apart from all moral doubts, close to tears for literally all of the movie. I don't think that a person with her characterization would have ever gotten into such a position. On the other end of course, the tough experienced fighter, who sleeps in the plane and wears flip flops at work, not caring of anything because he is way above it all. I really don't get what is so hard about creating believable characters. Those are definitely not.The second is that this is again America over everything. Maybe not concerning the moral but apart from that there are the American Super-Forces who show the simple people in Mexico how to do the job.All in all, those two points drew my attention away from the plot so much that I couldn't really enjoy the good sides, that definitely are there. Shortly said: This is not a Don't-watch but it's, and here I disagree, one of the best movies of any year.",6,1,3,18 March 2017
The Shape of Water," Nice film but a bit over-interpreted
","'The Shape of Water' tells the story of a young woman, who works as a cleaning lady in a state laboratory and becomes witness of a fish-like human creature that the scientists are trying to gain knowledge about. As she spends more time around the creature, she notices how rough he gets treated and starts to secretly take care of it. Soon after, grave injuries lead her to the decision to rescue the man and hide him, already deeply in love.It is without question a nice film with many pittoresque details and even as I am really not a fan of the producer's other films, I have to admit that it clearly has its moments. However, this movie is praised as a unique story about racism and its consequences and that it is not. Of course on a certain level the treatment of this creature can be considered racism but really this is just a love story between a human and what seems to be a frightening creature at first, just as, and I'm sorry to say that, Shrek or Avatar are. That doesn't make it a bad movie, it just shows that you shouldn't over-interpret films just because there are big names behind it.All in all you can surely watch this film and you won't regre it, just don't expect it to be something it's not and enjoy what it is, instead.",6,2,5,21 March 2018
Whiplash," Electrifying film, electrifying message?
","I wanted to watch Whiplash for quite a while now and now that I finally managed to, I'm not really sure what to think of it.It is without any doubt a movie of great beauty concerning the astonishing acting as well as the thoroughful production. You easily get drawn into the plot, you can relate to the pressure and the decisions made throughout the film. All in all it is a movie that will most definitely move a vast majority of its audience.What leaves me thinking is the message. Is it really necessary to de-humanize people to help them achieve greatness? When I look at modern-day sports and music, it indeed tends to be the case that being satisfied with yourself is a status not favorable. It seems that at one point you have to choose between being successful and being yourself. In the end of this film we see a young man, for whom no one is more important than himself. Who is incapable of leading a relationship or respecting others as humans. And yet the end of the film gives you the impression that this is worth it, that only through that harsh treatment and self-destruction he could achieve greatness. And this shouldn't be what we're teaching people.",8,1,3,30 November 2016
"Hail, Caesar!"," Better than the ratings
","'Hail, Caesar!' tells the story of a film company manager who has to deal with a kidnapped star, an attractive job offer, a lightly talented western actor and many more.This film has an almost incredible cast. If you notice how many really big names appear throughout the movie it gives you an impression of the reputation the Coen brothers have in Hollywood. This one surely isn't their best work so far but still I find it better than many of the ratings here would suggest. Even though there's not a huge story (which actually is the case in many other Coen films as well), I felt entertained and eager to know how things will turn out in the end. There's a fine sense of humour surrounding the way Hollywood is depicted here that breathes the love for cinema that motivates the producers. The acting of course is fantastic and these points add up in my opinion to make a decent film.All in all this is nothing you mustn't miss but it is a very nice addition to Hollywood cinema. Just give it a try and judge for yourself and you'll be probably surprised in a positive way.",7,0,0,10 February 2018
The Green Mile," Lots of empathy, mediocre story
","'The Green Mile' tells the story of a strange prisoner, a very big and muscular man, who is sentenced to death for murdering two small girls. As the prison staff, which behaves generally very kind towards the prisoners, get to know this one better, he shows signs of some supernatural power floating through his body, yet is destined for death.It is very easy to build up empathy with many characters of the movie. It is indeed a heart-touching story presented well but that's pretty much it. I'm neither a huge Stephen King fan, nor a huge fan of paranormal happenings in realistic surroundings, so you might want to read my preview with caution but having some kind of modern day Jesus in the death tract of an american prison is at least let's say.. an interesting choice. What you get is a well-produced adaption with some well-known actors. Unfortunatelly, I found the film to be not very suspenseful and it didn't really catch me and made me desire for more.All in all this movie is sure worth a watch, the more so if you generally like King's way to build up storys and mix them with fantastic elements. Otherwise this is a rather basic film with a rather odd plot.",6,1,2,15 December 2017
The Lion King," A classic, but..
","One can't argue, that 'The Lion King' is one of those movies people expect you to know when the conversation comes to films. After years of missed chances I finally managed to close this hole. Of course, as far as I can tell, I'm not exactly the peer group for this title, so I won't be judging too hard.The movie tells a nice story. One of those typical stories of good and evil, betrayal and loyalty and the difficulties of finding yourself. Wouldn't it be for the animals, it could as well be some historical drama. Whilest you don't get bored, partly due to the humorous sidekicks, the plot in itself is not really all to innovative.The big strength of the film is in my eyes the soundtrack, that produced quite a few classics that even I could recall. Singing in movies is always a risky thing but in this case reminds me of the old day Disney movies, where singing was almost something like a brand mark.'The Lion King' is short, but I'm sure children will be able to fall in love with the exceptionally drawn characters quite easily and therefor have their fun. Personally, I didn't quite see why this particular title has so much more credit than many other comparable movies but it entertained me well for an evening.",7,2,3,8 March 2017
Back to the Future Part II," Not as good as the first part but still a lot of fun
","Just as every sequel, Back to the Future Part 2 faces the challenge to make up for the missing element of surprise. Even though a lot of creativity was put into the movie, the bigger concept is already known from the first part. Gladly the Back to the Future series has some more things to offer, mainly the warm atmosphere it creates alongside with likable characters that are easy to cheer for.All in all I really wasn't disappointed by this film. I felt entertained and it didn't really have lengths. I would even consider watching it again after some time.What bothered me a bit though are the plot holes. In a world where everything changes out of smallest decisions how likely is it that the sports results remain the same? Also the rules for people remembering about their time travel seem a bit vague. In a movie that's centered around that theory, I would have expected the crew to consider that.Nonetheless, if you are looking for some easy, heart-warming entertainment, this is it.",8,1,1,18 January 2017
1408," Frightening but a bit over the top
","'1408' is one of the movies that can give you a hard time when you're watching it at home alone in the dark. We get to know the story of an author that earns his living writing books about haunted hotels, who has to realize that not every case is just a hoax. Of course this is a story already told so often that it is quite a lazy attempt to reflect this in the movie itself. This is by no means a creative movie, regarding the story. Nonetheless it is quite enjoyable for a number of reasons.The movie starts off rather slowly, the first paranormal phenomenons are still quite decent and that's something I really liked. Later on, unfortunately, they get the hammer out and at the latest when our hero lays in a room covered in snow, things shifted towards a bit too much. So why should you give this movie a try then? Because it achieves one of the most crucial things a horror film can achieve: It actually makes you feel uneasy. You can relate to the situation of the protagonist and you want to get out. It is exactly this feeling that makes this movie something special, achieved through clever ideas, a bit of well-proved horror tools and some plot-twists.You don't necessarily have to have seen this movie, I wouldn't go that far. But if you're looking for some paranormal frightening action, this is what you're searching for.",6,0,0,4 April 2017
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Love in all its facettes
","'Vicky Cristina Barcelona' tells the story of two very different young American women who, for different reasons, decide to travel to Spain together and fall in love with the same man. When his passionate ex-wife appears, things spiral out of control.First of all I have to say that after all that has happened, as much as I enjoy his films, everyone should carefully consider if he is alright working with him. It is not okay to just pretend nothing happened, if the accuses are true. Nontheless, I'll try to set that aside and only rate the movie. I didn't really enjoy this film as much as Allen's other works, possibly because some typical features like the subtle humor are missing. It manages to depict love in very different and true ways but sometimes the plot is missing some tempo and personally, the narrator seemed like a disturbance sometimes. However the film delivers some great acting, big names and surely a lot of good eye for the details of relationships.All in all this is a clever film about love and its forms but it is missing some of the esprit that other Woody Allen films convince with. It is, nonetheless, worth a watch, if you are willing to blend out who made it.",7,0,0,9 July 2018
The Truman Show," Why not serious?
","The Truman Show confronts us with a question more than one of us has probably at one point thought about before: What if everything I take for granted is indeed just fake? What if the world I live in isn't real and I'm just entertainment for someone else? While it does so, it raises some critical points. It's sad to say, but I'm quite sure that there would be plenty of people willing to produce such a show if they had the chance to do so. Furthermore I can also imagine that plenty of parents would be selling their children for glory and cash.While I really liked the female lead in this movie, I slowly begin to worry that I won't become a fan of Jim Carey in this life anymore. Not that he played bad it's just always a bit over the top, the smile a bit too bright and the behavior a bit too enthusiastic to really take the otherwise very earnest plot serious. I did cheer for him to escape, not at least to reunite with his true love, but the end may be a bit uncreative. In an otherwise perfect illusion the best they can do is the most obvious staircase I've seen in a while? And a painted wall? But never mind, what is so special about this film is that it is not too far away from what could happen. Especially nowadays, with the technology increasingly modernizing, it would probably be not too hard to make a baby grow up in a perfect illusion. And that is, indeed, a serious thing.",8,0,0,9 December 2016

","'Casino' tells the story of Mafia families, trying to enter the nightlife of Las Vegas. While everything is going more than smooth in the beginning, risk is rising when some of the involved develop own interests that could be most dangerous for the legal impression of the project.Some films just manage to instantly convince you that you're watching something special. This is one of them. Although the plot is nothing new or unseen, the storytelling is carried out so skillfully that it is hard not be drawn into the story right away. The film establishes original and exciting characters, even though I have to confess that the love story was the only weakness of the production for me. But the plausibility, the masterful tempo and flow of the film make up for this by far.All in all you shouldn't miss out on this piece that is not only a pleasure for fans of the genre but for anyone interested in movies, since it shows how to master a certain sort of film.",10,0,3,4 August 2018

Soon tensions begin to rise between them and the other prisoners and when a man is found dead, one of them is the first to be accused. A young law student is appointed to defend him in an improvised court room and what he finds out is rather shocking.In a way this movie felt like a modern day adaption of 'To kill a mockingbird'. I liked how it portrays the tensions within a group of men that actually share the same destiny and fight for the same goal. Had the film concentrated on this injustice, it would have been tremendous. As it is, it is still a great mocie but one with a unberably cheesy and nonsense ending that makes vilains to heroes and changes the whole message of the story. I'm quite sure there are a lot of historical inadequacies within this production, but that was the real disappointment to me.All in all I would recommend a watch nevertheless because it remains a film that is able to provoce a lot of emotions and anger and that deals with a topic that I feel is underrepresented within the genre.",9,0,0,10 February 2019
Kingsman: The Secret Service," A bit overrated
","'Kingsman: The Secret Service' tells the story of a privately funded Intelligence Agency, that consists of the best agents, trying to solve cases independent from countries and governments. When a rich enterpreneur plans to decrease humanity through a newly developed sim-card-technology, it is time for the newest members to proof that they earn their membership.For my personal taste, the movie is a bit too colorful and hectical. At points it feels more like a persiflage in itself and you really shouldn't start to think about the inner logic of the plot too much. The later consists of a crime quite similar to one Dan Brown described in one of his novels, only in a rather excentrical and odd way. The production value is high, the film looks great and has every technical feature to be considered a blockbuster. Unfortunately, the characters are a bit stereotypical, the story is rather predictable and the gags not always in the right spot.All in all this movie is a bit overrated in my eyes. I was expecting an adult comic movie such as Kick-Ass but sometimes this felt more like a Scary Movie for spies. The result is not a bad film, it is still quite entertaining and professionally produced but it doesn't stand out from the crowd.",6,1,2,7 May 2018
Green Book," Inspiring story with a tendency to humor
","'Green Book' tells the story of a talented musician of color who needs a driver for a tour to the South of America. When he is confronted with a rather direct Italian with some mafia contacts, a tour begins in which they both learn a lot about racism and themselves.The movie has a very touching and inspiring story. There were some controversies regarding the authenticity of that story and it should be stated that it is not sure to which extent the film is based on true events. The producers have an eye for comedy elements and tend to use them quite often, which is good for the entertainment value of the production but sometimes prevents a more sinister look on the underlying questions and problems. As it is, the movie is a good one and an enrichment but it isn't, in my eyes, absolutely outstanding.All in all this is surely worth a watch and raises some questions for the audience to think about. I would have preferred an approach that is less focussed on entertainment but that choice sure has its upsides.",7,0,0,28 April 2019
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," High School Romance
","'Eclipse' is the third part of the Twilight saga and deals with Bella, who increasingly wishes to become a vampire herself while she is not willing to leave Jacob behind and is caught between engagement with Edward and her desire for another man. At the same time an evil vampire is about to form an army that wolves and vampires have to fight side by side.First of all this movie is literally pretty dark, electrical light doesn't seem to have reached the Seattle area. Despite this fact 'Eclipse' is more or less your average High school love movie except that some of the characters show supernatural skills. However, the production is professional and the effects and technical side is appropriate for a blockbuster movie. Personally, I found a lot of plot points quite predictable but on the other hand I'm also probably not really the target group for the entire series.All in all it was entertaining enough to not really get bored, even though some of the lines are really hard to bear. If you're a fan of the series or if you just like teen romances with some additional drama, this could be a thing for you.",6,0,0,28 September 2017
Minions," Nice idea but..
","'Minions' tells the story of the famous yellow guys from the very beginning until the first movies start. It depicts their search for the most evil genius in order to obey him and serve.I really like the idea, it is a clever concept to turn around the usual search for a hero and make the main characters search for a villian instead. However, I think producers soon noticed that there is a little problem with that because there sure is a reason why magically the plot stops before the beginning of the two World Wars. Apart from that it is a so-so animation movie, including some nice and funny moments and parts that seem a bit unnecessary. I didn't get the feeling that they just wanted to milk the cash cow but unfortunately this is not more than average.All in all this film shows the difficulties of including actual history in what is supposed to be a funny animation movie for kids. It comes with a clever concept but I think that the approach chosen is not the ideal one.",6,0,0,19 October 2018
Incredibles 2," Really positive example
","'Incredibles 2' is the second part of the pixar 'Incredibles' series. In this part, a rich businessman tries to legalize super-heros but is betrayed by one of his beloved ones, leading to a highly dangerous situation for the 'Incredibles'-Family.Personally, I haven't seen the first part of the series (shame on me), but I was positively surprised by this movie. It really came with a lot of heart and didn't just milk the cash cow like some other animated movies tend to do. The film mixes a kids-friendly superhero plot with some family issues that especially parents will know well. The only thing that really bothered me is that there are some logical difficulties, for example that kids could have turned the other superheroes way sooner if they took their glasses off when they had the chance to.All in all this is an example of what an animated movie can achieve when it takes itself serious and doesn't just go after cheap gags or an uninspired plot that works well in cinemas. Both children and their parents will have their fun with this title.",8,1,3,3 November 2018
Macbeth," A Beautiful Atmosphere
","'Macbeth' is a modern adaption of the classic play by William Shakespeare. It takes over the well known story and enriches it with modern ways of production and technical possibilities.It is remarkable, what beautiful pictures this adaption delivers. It creates a very fitting mood that make the play believable and give it a rather dark and sinister tone. It sticks to the classical language, which, at times, can make it quite hard to follow the plot because it creates a rather bumpy flow but still it is surprising how well the theme of Macbeth still works centuries after its imagination. Additionally, the production manages to stay credible and avoid to make the film look like any cheap play you might have seen before.All in all I liked this movie pretty much even though at some times I would have wished for a more easy access concerning the big material it deals with. Still, the pictures alone are worth giving this one a try. If you can watch it on a big screen, I could imagine that it works out even better.",7,0,1,1 October 2017
Jurassic Park," Better than I thought but wrong focus
","'Jurassic Park' tells the story of an eccentric millionaire, who pays dns-specialists to awake long extinquished dinosaurs to life. Unfortunately, through a scheme of one of his workers, the security measures fail and everything starts to slip out of control.I am really not a huge fan of catastrophe movies, especially when they evolve large creatures, because more often than not they are built up similarly. Therefore, I was pleasantly surprised to see the film touch a lot of moral questions in the first half and rather discuss the topic on a theoretical basis. Unfortunately, the second half then meets the average catastrophe quite precisely, showing mainly characters hunted by dinosaurs, fighting for their lives in rushing and colorful pictures. This might be an unpopular opinion but I would have liked to remain on a more thoughtful basis rather than displaying a lot of action.All in all this is surely a well-produced and carried out movie that a lot of people will like. My problems with the film are more questions of taste and therefore I recommend you to give the film a fair chance, in some points it was way better than I expected.",6,2,5,2 June 2018
Draft Day," The magic of the men in the background
","'Draft Day' is a movie with Kevin Costner, telling the story of a NFL executive working for the Cleveland Browns who prepares for the annual Draft Day and gets in real trouble when he agrees on what seems to be a fabulous deal but turns out to be a dangerous trade when the prime candidate shows some dark sides and the coach disagrees on the deal.This is indeed a strong movie because it manages to create a thriller out of seemingly rather usual executive actions and makes you root for a main character that is, objectively spoken, not the most sympathetic guy. Personally I would have preferred had they taken an actual example of a real draft rather than create a fictional scenario but nonetheless this turns out to be a better thriller than many titles that include horrible crimes and chasing scenes. Of course this one also comes with a set of A-class actors but it would also work without them and that deserves respect.All in all I was never bored and really wanted to see how the plot turns out in the end. Of course you should have some basic knowledge of the sport or at least some interest but this could also be a good way to introduce you to the fascination of the game and everything that surrounds it.",7,0,0,26 November 2017
Atonement," Several stories in one
","'Atonement' is a movie evolving around a young girl who falsely accuses her sister's brother of rape and thus ruins and influences the life and relationship of both of them.The production is of high value, delivers beautiful pictures and a very earnest and atmospheric set-up. Unfortunately, at times it is a bit hard to follow the story because at several points the flashbacks and time shifts include such great deals of time that the coherence is suffering. The ending, on the contrary, is pretty strong and achieves to weaken the negative impact of the questionable story-telling. I like how parts of the movie are proved wrong and how the audience is surprised by that. However, it would have been of benefit to tell one story consequently and not different stories of false accusations, war and love.All in all it is a very well-produced and serious movie but in my eyes it is not superb. On the other hand I have to admit that I'm not a great fan of historical movies anyway, so I can guess that many people will like the film a lot better than I do and it is definitely worth a watch.",7,2,4,5 September 2017
The Godfather," Picture of a dynasty
","The Godfather was one of the great films that I still failed to watch, so lately I took the advantage and gave it a try. There is so much written and said about this movie already that you should probably go far more into the film to really get all the points that make this title as lasting as it has proved to be. But I'll try to sum up what went through my mind as a viewer without further knowledge of the background and making of The Godfather.First I have to say that I am not at all a huge fan of mafia films. Not that there weren't multiple good ones but the topic in general doesn't really catch me most of the time. What makes this one special is that it achieves to make plausible why people act the way they do. It doesn't glorify the mafia or paint a pittoresque picture of it, rather it shows how tired the business can make people and how even they hope for a better future for their children.You can really relate to how exhausting it has to be to be in danger all of the time, not knowing whom to trust or what to expect. Even though I'm quite sure not all the mafiosi were perfect gentlemen like described in the movie and cared first and foremost for the safety of children and innocents.The running time is indeed quite long, but since it could be characterized somehow as kind of a saga, you don't really start to feel bored. To be totally honest, even though some parts could be also told shorter, it didn't bother me at all.What prevents me from giving it a full 10 stars are mainly two aspects. First the characters, or at least some of them appear a bit stiff. Hoe Michael turns from a 'regular' member of the family to someone that is left with one facial expression only is somehow not really believable. Which leads secondly to some plot points that I think are a bit under-explained. When Michael's wife gets killed in Italy and he returns just to tell Kay he loves her, that development just seems a bit out of the blue to me.But never mind, you see how much work and effort was put into this movie and no-one should regret seeing it. I don't think it is a must-see because after all it's message for me is not that powerful but if you are looking for a well made movie then you should definitely lay back and give it a go.",9,0,0,6 December 2016
