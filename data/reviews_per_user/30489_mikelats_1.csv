The Blair Witch Project," Overrated
","This is maybe the most overrated film of all times. It never looks like true footage at all. Not scary, nor creepy, nor unsettling, nothing. Just three folks walking through the woods, running and shouting. The only original thing about this is to release it as a movie!I know that MANY people love this one, but to me the only good thing about it is how cheap it was and how much money they got from it. If you want an unsettling movie with no blood at all, go watch Rosemary's Baby.",2,0,2,20 December 2002
