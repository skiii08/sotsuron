Vertigo," One of the best movies of all time
",It's my favorite movie of Alfred Hitchcock. I really like it. James Stewart and Kim Novak are superb and the soundtrack is one of the best ever. The expedient of the letter shows how Hitchcock prefers the construction of the tension to the simple twist. Hitchcock's direction is superb and innovative with the creation of the famous vertigo effect. It was snubbed by the Academy as usual. The Academy Award has always been a commercial premium. Hitchcock and many other directors like Stanley Kubrick would have deserved many more prizes and consideration. It is one of the favorite films of Martin Scorsese and many other directors. The movie is just perfect and a true milestone in cinema. It's a must see.,10,4,6,7 April 2016
