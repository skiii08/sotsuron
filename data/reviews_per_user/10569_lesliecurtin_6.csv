It," The TV movie was better
",Sure the special effects were better in the new version but I never believed this group of kids were friends. In the original they defeat Pennywise because they believed in the magic of every day things and the magic of friendship.,5,1,3,18 August 2019
It," Where's the Magic
","Really disappointed with this. The mini series, although lacking in wonderful acting, was about the power of friendship and magic. Eighties kids were far too cool to really believe in magic...even the geeky ones.",5,0,1,25 November 2018
Aquaman," No Thanks
","Even a half-naked Jason Moana can't save this poorly written, over blown movie.",4,1,5,29 November 2019
Mamma Mia!," Late to the party
","I'm watching this for the first time. Love the ABBA songs but come on- if it were anyone other than Meryl Streep no one would have watched it.
She is so far over the top it's laughable.",4,1,3,1 September 2019
Midsommar," Horrible
",Can you spell suck? Bad acting. Ridiculous plot and the special effects? Sixth grade theatre club made better fake heads.,2,1,6,8 February 2020
La La Land," I don't get it
","This was a huge disappointment. All the hoopla, all the awards. Frankly I don't see what the draw was. The acting wasn't stellar. The music? I would rather watch anything with Lerner and Lowe or Rogers and Hammerstein music...and I mean anything. The choreography was humdrum. I could do those dances. Try a Ginger Rogers/Fred Astaire dance number if you really want to see talent. PS. It's not just me. I don't know one person who loved this film. I'm glad I only spent $1.15 at Redbox.",3,7,12,1 May 2017
