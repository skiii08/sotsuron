The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Maybe some other time
","I haven't read the book so the only expectations I had for this movie was my excitement to see Emma Watson since the Harry Potters ended. I'd heard from people that it was 'pretty good', so I saved it for one of those rare days where I was home alone with no boyfriend to protest while knocking some chores off my list of things to do. I'll give it this: it might be one of those movies where you really have to sit down and pay attention to it...because I was bored to death. I ended up turning it off halfway through because I just needed something more interesting and uplifting. It was so monotonous and well, dull...and honestly felt like it had some slightly dark tones. I just found myself being able to walk away, come back, and have not missed anything. All in all, there are a lot more movies on my list to catch up on and maybe one day I will get back around to it and give it another try, or maybe read the book first.",3,1,3,19 June 2013
Coraline," Um...no.
","I don't understand how people could like this movie. That being said, I was actually surprised that I DIDN'T like it. It has everything I like...animation, Tim Burton-style darkness and weirdness, and plays into your imagination. However, I just couldn't seem to drag myself into it. I tried! I think I've attempted to watch this movie at least 3-4 times by now but I never make it all the way through. I just kind of lose interest and walk away around the same time. I don't even really know what it is about that I don't like, it's hard to pinpoint. It just kind of falls flat for me. But everyone has different interests and tastes, so this is just my opinion. I know a lot of people who love the same kind of animated movies like I do and they didn't like it either, but I know others who love it a lot. I guess it just is one of those movies that speaks to certain people.",3,0,8,24 June 2013
The Notebook," Has yet to be topped
","The Notebook is, by all accounts, the greatest love story of all time. I have yet to see anyone top this movie in terms of romance. It is a necessary date night/Valentines Day/anniversary movie to remind us all that true love can yet be imperfect and in fact does exist. When I saw this in theaters, I was crying very hard. At the time, I was NOT a person who cried during movies (that is completely opposite now). Its not just about the way it makes you cry though, it teaches anyone a deep lesson about how even the greatest love has flaws and that it has to be worked on every single day, and is always worth it in the end. I can't imagine that this movie will ever be outdone in this century, and I firmly believe that it is the new Gone With The Wind...minus the extra 2 hours. This is the one and only time I think I will ever say that the movie is better than the book. What the book lacked, the movie changed for the better and did a flawless job with it. 10/10",10,1,3,24 June 2013
Madagascar," Enjoyable
","Madagascar is about four animal friends that reside in the New York Zoo. Alex the lion is the star and enjoys it. His best friend Marty the zebra yearns for open space and freedom, and on his birthday goes missing from his cage. Alex teams up with Gloria the hippo and Melman the giraffe to go looking for Marty and end up on a wild ride that lands them on the island of Madagascar. They slowly come to realize they have no idea what life in the wild is really like and begin their desperate attempt to find their way home. It is funny, colorful, and enjoyable for all ages. The actors voices are paired perfectly with their characters. 9/10!",9,0,0,26 June 2013
Ted," A lot better than I expected
","I'd heard from many people that Ted was not really that good, and since all my friends and I are huge Seth Macfarlane fans, this stunned me. We are also huge fans of Mila Kunis and Mark, so we thought it couldn't do any wrong. I waited for it to come out on DVD. I actually really loved it! I don't know what exactly people disliked about it, but I thought that it was great for what it was. Yes, there are a lot of 80's references. I am not an 80's lover AT ALL, so I thought this would be my point of undoing but I found that since I didn't really know most of the references very well, it wasn't anything to be bothered about. I love the use of weed smoking in this movie, because the hard truth that American's don't want to face is that more people than they realize smoke weed and it's really not that big of a deal. Those that think it is are just brainwashed by the government telling them that it's wrong and dangerous, yadda yadda. I'm not sitting here saying I do it, because I don't, but I also don't condemn those who do. I fully support movies that don't shy away from the subject. Anyhow, as long as you don't expect this movie to keep you laughing from start to finish without stopping, and you don't have a problem with a bit of drug use and partying and seeing Mila Kunis fog up your screen with her hot self, then this movie is great for you! Is it perfect? No. But it wasn't bad or disappointing. There are even a few heartfelt scenes for those who like that.",9,1,5,11 June 2013
My Neighbor Totoro," Still blows me away
","I watched this movie when I was a kid, and now at 25 years old watched it just last year again and am still totally enchanted by it. This movie got me in the threshold of the world of Anime, and although I'm not really THAT into it, it did open doors for certain movies for me. Having re-watched it recently, I found myself wishing it had gone on longer and was still totally captivated by the magic that is Totoro. It plays perfectly to your imagination and delights you to no end. It is 25 years old though, so don't expect the dubbing to be perfect. Great for young kids and parents watching with them will not get bored. Highly recommend!",10,0,1,24 June 2013
The Jungle Book," Still one of the greatest Disney's to date
","Disney is able to brag that 9/10 fans name The Jungle Book as their favorite of the Disney Classics. It is categorized as a Masterpiece, and masterpiece it is! Disney's magic touch was taking the classic stories and turning them into cartoons that kids and adults alike can enjoy, making characters and even certain villains into favorites. Most movies have one or two best characters, but in this movie you come to love almost all characters on the same level! Baloo will always be the go-to for favorites, being the goofy trouble-making big bear that befriends Mowgli. You can come to love the sly, realistic and fatherly Bagheera. Kaa the hypnotizing snake gets several laughs, voiced by the talented Sterling Holloway who gave us Disney gold such as Winnie the Pooh and the Cheshire Cat in Alice in Wonderland. This might be Disney's greatest villain as Shere Khan the tiger is coy, deceitfully honest, and frightening. They can never remake this movie and have it be anywhere near as good, and I hope many generations to come are able to have this wonderful movie touch their lives as it has my generation.",10,2,5,13 June 2013
21 Jump Street," Finally something that can stand up next to Superbad!
","I didn't see any previews and therefore had no expectations for this movie, but 21 Jump Street had me falling out of my chair laughing. I am so glad I saw this one in theaters, because comedies are best enjoyed with lots of people laughing right along with you. I thought Tatum and Jonah were comedy gold and executed their lines perfectly. I love that this movie called out the new generations of kids and their weird trends that don't even make sense. They referenced the old show, and even had a big surprise cameo at the end that had my theater screaming with delight. It's about two high school rivals who become best friends when they join the police academy. They get sent undercover to a local high school to uncover a drug ring for a new type of drug being introduced. They end up rediscovering themselves in a hilarious journey. If you liked Superbad, this movie might finally live up to your comedy expectations. It does happen to be one of those movies that are split with opinions...some people really love it, some people don't.",10,0,2,26 June 2013
Kung Fu Panda 2," Better than the first!
","Don't get me wrong, I loved the first one just as much as the next person. However, it is rare to find a sequel that boasts to be just as good if not better than the original, and this is one of those rare films. This one takes you behind the story of how Po came to be who he is, and I loved that concept. They took all the great elements of the first and emphasized them in this one, which is a smart move...the only thing missing was the 'skidoosh!' and that is a shame. They gave every character a little more. Even Tigress, who barely had any lines in the first, had a bigger role in this one. The action was greater, the villain was greater, and the story was greater. To top it off, the very final scene before the credits caused me to burst into tears of excitement! I really hope they make a third because I am dying to see them play on that scene!",9,0,1,24 June 2013
Silver Linings Playbook," What was that?
","Like other reviewers, I had high expectations for this movie. I didn't know anything about the plot, I just saw short previews and really wanted to see it because I am a huge Jennifer Lawrence fan and what girl doesn't swoon for Bradley Cooper? I was even more excited to see it when I found out Jennifer won a best actress Oscar for this role. I was so disappointed!The movie ends up being about Bradley Cooper (I forget the characters name) who catches his wife cheating on him in the shower of his home, and upon confronting them, the man she is cheating on him with tells him to leave. This sends Brad into a rage and he snaps mentally and beats him within an inch of his life. He is sent to a mental institution and is released about a year later. He returns to his parents home in Philly, and you slowly start to think that everyone in the town might be mentally unstable. His mom is an impossibly annoying woman who doesn't seem to have a backbone and lets her extremely OCD husband walk all over her. The dad is played by Robert DiNero, whom I had no idea was in the movie, so that was a nice surprise. This does seem to be the only movie that he is fully engaged in, and he plays his character very well, but to the point where you almost hate him. He bets on The Eagles' football games and has to have a remote placed in a certain spot and facing a certain direction. Brad is out of his mind weird, and although it was refreshing to see him playing such a different character, you just get so frustrated with the character and you find yourself wishing for the movie to end. Brad wears a trash bag over sweats in almost every single scene because he runs, and you come to loathe trash bags. Things do perk up a lot when he meets Jennifer, which comes into play because he goes over to his best friends house for dinner and his wife is the sister of Jennifer, who is played by Julia Styles. It was very nice to see her face again so that was something good about it. Jennifer also has mental issues, because her police husband died and she tends to say or do what she wants. She is a bit Gothic, but only a touch which is good because if she had been any more so I wouldn't have made it very far in the movie. Jennifer is, for lack of a better word, a slut. She is open about the fact that she sleeps with men and is not proud of it. She is great at adding life to the otherwise boring movie by throwing random tantrums and screaming. Brad and Jen team up for an upcoming dance competition that is meant for professionals and they both know they don't stand a chance. They help heal each other by their dancing and there is a nice little twist at the end of the movie (which I will not spoil for anyone) that turns out she knew a lot more about what was really going on than anyone else did. The movie ends with Brad's dad making a major bet that the Eagles would win and also that Jen and Brad would score a 5 in the competition, which are on the same night. All in all, the people I was watching this with were complaining loudly that they wanted it to end, and I was right there along with them. I don't really like watching movies about mentally unstable people and even more so about OCD people. I did really love Jennifer in it and thought she absolutely deserved the Oscar.",4,2,4,11 June 2013
Spider-Man," They did this superhero so wrong
","Honestly, I'm not a major superhero/Marvel comics person. But I do enjoy them just as much as the next person, and believe that they should be done correctly and tastefully and to step with the comics of which they were based on. I believe this Spiderman movie does him complete injustice. While the first one was not as terrible, the second and third were appalling. I was a lot younger when they first came out and even then I didn't really enjoy or like them. It wasn't well done, the actors were very boring, and I hear from fans that they slaughtered the original comics. I never understand why the movie industry feels the need to change important things, unless it is to save time or they simply do not have the technology to do it justice. The movies felt very watered down, and Kristen's acting is a bit painful to watch. I actually like her in other movies but this is definitely not one of them. She just doesn't seemed fully committed to it. The new Spiderman movie is so much better, watch that one instead.",4,0,2,11 June 2013
Django Unchained," Oh my Django!
","If you are a Tarantino fan, prepared to be blown out of your seat. This movie is beyond epic, so much so that it needs to invent a new word for epic. This has to be beyond a shadow of a doubt the greatest movie Tarantino has ever done (and if you've seen one QT movie you'll know what a huge statement that is) and in my opinion the greatest movie of this century. If you are sensitive to the use of the N word, this might not be something you should watch, because it reportedly gets dropped over 110 times. The actors were completely mesmerizing, with Leonardo DiCaprio outshining all of them with one simple scene. I was very happy to see Christoph Waltz play a character that didn't scare the crap out of me but by no means did that make him a soft guy in the movie. The soundtrack is phenomenal, with a perfect balance of old-timey music and newer music. The song 'Freedom' is the best, because it sounds like a slave song but written in modern times and I love jamming out to it. Absolute, hands down, 10/10!!!Tip: DO NOT MAKE THIS INTO A DRINKING GAME IF YOU DON'T WANT ALCOHOL POISONING. My friends and I invented one and the rules were (this was for our first time watching)...1) drink every time there is a slavery reference 2) the N word is dropped, and 3) they say Django. We had to stop playing halfway through.",10,3,7,24 June 2013
Bolt," Bolt for president!
","Oh Bolt! How I love you! This is by far one of my top favorite animated movies of all time, and I'm not even a John Travolta fan! My favorite thing about this movie is the opening. If you watch this with someone who doesn't know what is going to happen, the opening credits are fun to watch them be surprised by. I love a good twist! I thought John did a fantastic job (probably because I didn't have to look at his actual face, which was really only good for Grease) and even Miley didn't annoy me the way she usually does. The hamster was a fantastic addition and is pretty much everyone's favorite character. The pigeons were so well animated I was keeled over laughing from how life-like they were and their New York accents just made it that much better! I won't sum up the plot because if you haven't seen it and don't know what to expect from it, there is nothing I can say that won't give the opening credits surprise away and since that is my favorite part about it I refuse to ruin that for anyone. Great for kids, great for teens, great for adults. This is true Disney gold! 10/10! I would give it a 20/10 if I could!",10,2,3,12 June 2013
Gran Torino," Okay, fine...it was kind of amazing.
","My dad tends to have bad taste in movies and I don't take his recommendations very seriously, so when he raved about this movie it took a good bit of convincing for me to give it a try. I haven't seen very many, if any, Clint Eastwood movies and kinda brushed him off as the quirky, grumpy old guy that everyone makes fun of. This movie was powerful, deep, packed full of life lessons and the best part: Clint Eastwood dropping so many verbal bombs on the Asians. I'm sorry, but they were some seriously funny one liners. I was dying. The movie is about an old guy living on an old block that is slowly being taken over by other races much to his disapproval. He ends up taking on the neighbor boy to do chores for him and they form an unlikely friendship. My summation of this is meager at best, the depth that the story takes you into these characters and friendships is beyond anything that I can put into words. I never thought a growling grump could make me laugh and cry the way Clint did...if you haven't had the pleasure of seeing this movie yet, I highly encourage you to do so. It's also a great watch with your tween/teen if you can over look some of the language and racist phrases.",9,0,2,19 June 2013
The Nightmare Before Christmas," Even skeletons never die
","I don't know a single person who doesn't love this movie. Tim Burton nailed this one in my eyes, and this is the movie that introduced my generation to him and to claymation as well. I was very young when this movie came out, and yes it scared me but it was the greatest movie ever. This the go-to movie when it's time for Halloween, and Christmas as well, to get you in the spirit! The soundtrack is gold and every song is fantastic and you know most of the words from the first time you see it. It has been almost 20 years since it came out and it still has a cult following, a mega franchise and screaming fans of all ages. Disney was right to pick up the rights for this movie because I guarantee you it has done nothing but given them more money for years to come. It may scare very small children but they will either get over it or come to love it in a couple of years.",10,3,4,24 June 2013
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Black Mamba strikes
","I was a little young when this movie came out and had not seen any other Tarantino movies, so you can imagine I was a bit shocked by it. At the time, the gore and violence was a bit extreme (not unheard of, just not as common as it is in films today) and it took awhile to get used to. I had to watch it several times to come to love it the way I do now. Tarantino is a genius and one of my all time favorite filmmakers on earth. His mind is simply genius. Kill Bill is about an ex assassin who had a formal love relationship with her leader, Bill, that resulted in a pregnancy. To protect the baby, the Black Mamba fled the team and was about to get married to a safe guy when Bill shows up on the night of the rehearsal dinner with the team and they kill everyone. Black Mamba narrowly avoids death and is put in a 4 year coma. She wakes up to find her baby did not survive and sets out to seek revenge on all of the team members, saving Bill for last. It is an epic, violent journey that keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.",9,1,3,26 June 2013
Prisoners," What a waste of time and brains
","My friends raved and raved about this movie so I was very excited to see and probably had too high expectations? I. HATED. This. Movie.First of all, it dragged on foooorrrreeevvvveeerrrrr. It felt like I was sitting there for 5 hours. Yes it was enjoyable to try and guess whodunnit but I am so angry about the ending that it ruined the rest of it for me.Obviously I won't spoil it for anyone but be warned IT CUTS OFF! You sit through all of that, they don't show outcomes of a few characters, and you're waiting for your happy ending closure and then BAM! Credits. I can't believe I wasted that much time when I could have knocked at least 2 other movies off my list that night. Nothing, I repeat NOTHING makes me angrier than a movie with no closure. It's designed so that you can assume what happens but screw that, if I have to sit there and go through all that stuff just to leave it up to my imagination what happens in the end it's automatically failed. My other pet peeve is that Jake Gyllenhaal was a terrible cop. Not that his acting was bad, but his character itself was retarded. He was ALWAYS alone, never followed protocol, never let anyone know where he was and that is just bad writing. The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is because I've seen worse.If you are like me and need closure and answers, DO NOT waste your time on this movie.",2,7,14,19 March 2014
The Mummy Returns," Do not see this movie if you liked the first
","I was beyond obsessed with the first Mummy when it came out. I was about 11 years old and saw it in theaters, and went back to see it three more times (this was when movie ticket prices were actually affordable). I LOVED that movie, so you can imagine my excitement when they released the sequel. As stated in my headline, if you loved the first one...DO. NOT. SEE. ANY. SEQUELS. They completely ruined it. I have seen every sequel and all of them were terrible. Of the rest of the sequels, this one is the better, so if you feel compelled to see them then only stick to this one because it is semi-decent, but again none of them are anywhere close to being good.",3,0,0,24 June 2013
Rio," Not perfect but still good
","This colorful movie will delight young viewers and keep older ones from getting too bored as it takes you on a wild ride through Brazil.Rio is about a rare Blue Macaw parrot named...well, Blue...who was raised in a cold small town in Minnesota by a bookstore clerk. Blue never needed a reason to fly until one day they were approached by a bird specialist working to repopulate the Blue Macaws. He brings them to Brazil and Blue ends up going on the ride of his life. It is fun, light hearted, and enjoyable. The music is great as well, especially with Will.I.Am lending his talent to the Brazillian beats. As a previous reviewer stated, there is something missing to this movie, but I just can't put my finger on it. Its not perfect, but it is a great movie that the whole family can enjoy.",7,0,0,26 June 2013
Ice Age," A fun and original movie for all
","Ice Age was a completely original story when it first came out, and in this last generation it is hard to be original in the film industry. Ice Age is about three prehistoric creatures forming an unlikely friendship over something unexpected. Manny the Mammoth believes himself to be the last mammoth alive (having watched his wife and child lose their lives to the savage human tribes that kill for meat and fur to stay alive) and unwillingly befriends an idiotic sloth named Sid. A group of saber tooth tigers seek revenge on the human tribes for attacking their pack and the leader tells Diego to kill a woman and her baby, and asks that he bring the baby to him alive. The woman flees into a river with the baby, and having washed onto a rock, sees Manny and Sid watching her. She slides the baby before them and disappears into the river. Manny and Sid set out to return the baby to the tribe, and run into Diego who pretends to befriend them in order to steal the baby at the right time. They end up going on an adventure and form a pack of their own. This movie is full of laughter, emotion, and life lessons that people of all ages can enjoy.",9,0,0,26 June 2013
Ice Age: Continental Drift," Keeps getting better!
","Obviously, the original can never be touched. That being said, people tend to think that the sequels get worse. Nowadays, they aren't stopping at three and Ice Age is no exception. Granted, the released sequels aren't necessarily better, but they aren't bad! As long as you don't take them too seriously, like most people on here do, you can have fun with it and just enjoy the ride. Of the sequels, I enjoyed this one the most. I thought the plot was reasonably realistic and I enjoyed the characters, new and old. The thing that made me giddy with excitement was realizing the captain was played by Peter Dinklage! I am a huge fan of him, being a fan of Game of Thrones, and he played a fantastic villain. In contrast, I am not a fan of Jennifer Lopez by any means and I liked her character as well...that may or may not have anything to do with the fact that I really like white tigers. It's got laughs, great characters, warm moments, life lessons, and even some mythical creatures! And we get to see a bit more of Scrat...and who doesn't love that silly little squirrel thing? I think this sequel has topped 2 & 3 and is definitely worth watching!",8,4,4,13 June 2013
The Lion King," 'Masterpiece' is a gross understatement
","Saw this movie when it came out in theaters...saw this movie in 3D in theaters...own this movie in 3D at home. Have seen every sequel, saw the Broadway show twice and plan on seeing it again. What more can you say about this movie? It is timeless, Disney's first original full length animation that was completely their own story, and they may not ever be able to top that. The Lion King will be an all ages favorite for generations to come and people will be singing the music for their whole lives. The Lion King teaches you so many life lessons and all the while you're singing, dancing, and crying along with it. It also was backed by Elton John on the soundtrack which just makes it more epic.",10,1,1,26 June 2013
Fantastic Mr. Fox," What a refreshing breath of air!
","I had no idea what to expect when I saw this movie, and I've always been weary of claymation so I didn't actually think I would love this movie as much as I did. It was pretty spectacular and seriously underrated! George Clooney's iconic voice lends much personality to his character even when he was being a bit monochromatic or sarcastic. There are scenes in this movie that are still at the top of my favorites list and whenever I get a chance I try to show this movie to as many people as I can. This movie is mainly for adults rather than children, but I'm guessing children could be entertained by it too. I loved the way they skirted around swearing by coming up with a unique way to do it and my friends and I love quoting it around kids and parents, who aren't sure what to make of it when it happens. There is a particular scene where a farmer loses his temper and to this day it makes me fall out of my chair laughing. The wolf at the very end almost makes me lose it too. I highly recommend this movie if you're looking for animated movie that is more suitable for adults, you'll be pleasantly surprised!",9,0,1,14 June 2013
Thor: The Dark World," Everybody calm the eff down
","I am sick to death of users on here thinking they are paid critics! NOBODY CARES THAT YOU ARE SO SELF ABSORBED THAT YOU RUIN MOVIES FOR YOURSELF BY BREAKING DOWN EVERY STUPID THING! JUST GO TO THE MOVIE AND ENJOY IT DAMN IT!I really liked this movie because I didn't look so far into it other than it's a sequel of a good movie that has hot lead roles and an excellent villain. It wasn't as good as the first but it wasn't bad by any means. It essentially had the same feel as the first one and that's good enough for me. I liked that it was set in London this time. Also, I liked that Kat Dennings got more screen time than the first because I love her to death and she was really funny. Speaking of which, this movie had a lot more laughs and I enjoyed that. It's always good to have stupid little laughs here and there in a serious-ish movie like this one. Just go to the freaking movie, sit back and enjoy the ride. Don't get caught up in 'the dimensions of the characters' (It's based off comic strip, are you guys serious right now?) I can't imagine a bigger waste of money than going to a movie in theaters and stripping it bare. Leave that up to the paid guys who hate their lives and love making everyone else feel bad about themselves. IT WAS A GREAT MOVIE, DON'T LISTEN TO THESE LAME A-HOLES ON HERE!",9,0,1,19 March 2014
Pitch Perfect," A ca Awesome!
","I didn't know what to expect from this movie, the previews didn't give you a good idea of what it was about, so I kind of skipped seeing this one in theaters and waited for it to come out on DVD. I threw it on my laptop while my boyfriend was playing video games because I like to catch up on my girly movies when he does that...needless to say, he stopped playing halfway through and made me stream it to the TV. This movie is gold! It's hilarious, it has great music AND mashup music which is my favorite, awesome actors make appearances at random (MCLOVIN!) and it by no means is a girly movie. My boyfriend is the manliest they can come and he likes it so much that just last night I caught it on HBO while he was on his way to bed and he stayed up to watch it for our third time with me. It's hard to say what the best part of the movie is...the hilarious commentators, Rebel Wilson who makes me geek out even when she doesn't say anything, the music or the disgusting (yet funny) vomit scenes. This movie will inspire younger people to get into A Capella, without it being too much of a corny musical. This is now one of my new favorite movies and I highly recommend for teens and up!",10,1,4,24 June 2013
Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted," Trapeze Americano!
","The first Madagascar was great. The second? Pretty bad, in my opinion. The only thing good the second had going on for it was the music. So when I watched Most Wanted, I had very low expectations. I was pleasantly surprised! I think they knew that the second one wasn't good and strove to make the third much better, and they nailed it! I was entertained and laughed a lot. The new characters were awesome, I especially loved Jessica Chastain's character and her accent. It was also very cool to see Martin Short doing something again, I can't remember the last movie I saw with him in it! The movie is funny, the animation is brilliant, there are a lot of colors, and even the villain is hilarious. I definitely recommend this movie for all ages!",8,1,2,14 June 2013
Slumdog Millionaire," Wow!
","This movie will blow you away. It takes you on a wild journey from start to finish, and it seriously opens your eyes to what life is like in India if you know next to nothing about it. I was spellbound from the moment it began and was on my feet at the end. I am very sad to have missed this in theaters, I only started hearing about it when it had been there for awhile. This movie began Dev Patel's career and he is an extraordinary actor. The music is perfect, at least three songs make the top of my favorite movie soundtracks list. There is even a corny dance at the end (apparently it's a bit of a tradition for Indian films) that I loved and I was so impressed. The story is so unique and I did read the book after watching the movie but it was so long ago I can't remember if it strayed from the original story. This will be one of my favorite movies for many years to come!",9,0,2,24 June 2013
Shark Tale," Worth watching
","This movie is by no means perfect, but it is a good one that I have watched many times. I think I even saw it in theaters more than once. The all star cast really helps it out too. I still enjoy this movie and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys animated movies. It's about Oscar the fish (Will Smith) who works at the Whale Wash is tired of living like a commoner and dreams about the lifestyle of the rich and famous. He works for a puffer fish named Sykes (sp?) whose business is controlled by the Shark mafia headed by Don Lino (obviously Robert Di Niro). Oscar owes Sykes a lot of money and is given one last chance to get it back for him. He tries to do so and fails and is about to be killed by the mafia's jellyfish henchman (Ziggy Marley and Doug E. Doug) and Don Lino's 'vegetarian' son Lenny (Jack Black) and his brother who is trying to teach him how to be a killer. The brother is killed by an anchor dropping on him and a distraught Lenny flees. The jellyfish return to find Oscar standing over the body and think that he killed him. Oscar decides to go along with this story and is instantly famous for being the Shark Slayer. He ends up befriending and teaming up with Lenny in an attempt to keep up this appearance. This movie has some hilarious scenes and some really funny and sneaky references to other movies and things. It is very entertaining for people of all ages and even though it is almost 10 years old, still has bright vivid colors and the animation does a great job of capturing life under the sea.",7,2,2,12 June 2013
