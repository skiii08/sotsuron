Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Really witty and funny - a great movie!!!
","This movie was worth every penny I spent on it. I watched it immediately when it was released on the pre-premiere on the 16-th of December 2011. 2 hours and nine minutes just flew by. I couldn't believe it. But whatever. The plot was really well constructed and situations intertwined really smoothly, with no rough, unnecessary scenes and plot deviations. The humour - very thin, light and naughty. Full of hilarious and in the same time horrifying deeds of Sherlock. The characters fill their positions amazingly well. Actually this is the second movie after The Devil's Rejects, which is actually better then the First Part. I don't want to give details in order not to spoil it. Watch it - it's going to be worth your time and money!",10,3,6,23 December 2011
