Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Despite it's flaws, the movie is still superficially entertaining.
","Call me old school but I learned just about everything I needed to know about vampires from the classic mid-80s movies Fright Night and The Lost Boys.Rule numero uno: sunlight kills vampires. Period. If it can tolerate daytime, it's not a vampire. So with this in mind, know that everything that is right about Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, none of it overcomes this flaw in it's premise. By-the- way, there's not a whole lot right with the movie anyway. Based off the popular novel of the same name by Seth Gramme-Smith, Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter, the film explores the premise of what if the 16th POTUS was motivated his entire life by a deep seeded hatred and personal vendetta against 'vampires'. (Please take note of the sarcastic quotation marks). These (historically) creatures of the night masquerade in 19th century America as inn-keepers, pastors, blacksmiths and among other things, plantation/ slave owners. The last of which is morally reprehensible to 'Honest Abe' because his mother was killed by a racist 'vampire' and his life long best friend is a abolitionist Black man (The Hurt Locker's Anthony Mackie)The main problem with this film (besides my beef with the misappropriation of the word vampire) is that it moves way too fast from scene to scene. The pace reminded me of the way a comic book reads resulting in very poor character development and cinematic rhythm. Some scenes were no longer than just a few seconds long; about the time it takes to read a page or two of a graphic novel. The novel is described as  'mash-up' of comic, horror, historical and thriller genres. Unfortunately, the film just doesn't successfully get the chemistry correct. There is little in the way of comedy, horror, thrills or historical accuracy to be found. The script is full of plot holes and logical inconsistencies that make as much sense as the silent 'L' in Lincoln's part name. There is, however, enough action to almost make up for the lack of real substance and logic. If the film aimed to be a mind numbing action fest rather than a high brow thought provoking, good humored historical, study into the fictional motivations of the'Great Emancipator', I may have been less cynical and more forgiving. Ironically, watching a young Liam Nesson looking Benjamin Walker attempt to be an action hero is mildly comedic. Whether this was intentional or not; only the film makers know.Timur Bekmambetov who directed the 2008 bullet bending Matrix-esque film Wanted, shoots AL:VH's action scenes once again liberally using that super- slowed- down-then-super-sped-up film style that made movies like The Matrix, Wanted and Sherlock Holmes visually clever and stunning. As a matter of fact, this movie could (arguably) be described as 300 meets Holmes meets Blade although I'm still calling foul in the use of the term vampire! (Yeah, I know, I need to let out go.)The fact that it was filmed in 3D rather than converted to 3D in post production assists this movie from being a complete disaster as the cinematography is remarkable. The camera picks up the smallest detail of the elaborate period sets and the 3D subtlety enhances those minuscule details. Despite it's flaws, the movie is still superficially entertaining. It may have that odd quality that one day land it cult classic status. Had it not been rated R this movie could have been perfectly marketed towards a young audience and shaped the vampire experience of todays teenagers like Fright Night and The Lost Boys did for me...as long as they don't mind sunlight tolerant...",3,3,9,22 June 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," Creative new spin on a modern-day American fairy tale that doesn't stray far from the heart of the classic origin.
","Studio: Columbia/Sony Cast: Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Rhys Ifans, Martin Sheen, Sally Field Rating: PG-13 Running Time: 136 minutesOne of the only strikes against 'The Amazing Spider-Man' is the fact it's a reboot of a very popular and successful film series. That's an issue only because in a summer where two of the biggest comic book based franchises ( 'The Avengers', 'The Dark Knight Rises')  compete to break and set box office records, few were excited about a do-over of the film series that takes the audience back to the beginning of an already well known story. Unfortunately, the very capable Sam Raimi, director of the first three Spider-Man films and Columbia/Sony couldn't agree on several aspects of the future of the franchise so instead of moving ahead with a fourth installment the studio immediately began production on this 're- imaging'.The gamble paid off as 'The Amazing Spider-Man' creatively puts a new spin on a story so well known that it is practically a modern-day American fairy tale. From the opening scene, the score reveals that the tone of the film is going to be much darker than the Toby McGuire/ Kirsten Dunst vehicle.Since the majority of the characters have been well established on screen over the past 10 years (nevermind the past 50 years of comic book history) in order for the latest film to succeed it was imperative for the new cast to totally own their roles beginning with Andrew Garfield (The Social Network) as the new Peter Parker. He does an excellent job not only establishing himself as the iconic alter-ego of Spider-Man but he also successfully reinvents the personality of Peter Parker. At the core of the character is his witty one-liners which Garfield delivers with the comic timing of comedy veterans like Billy Crystal. His Peter is still a super smart teen and sort of a square peg but Garfield manages to infuse an aura of cool never before been seen in the character. Denis Leary and Rhys Ifans seamlessly take over roles previously played by James Cromwell and Dylan Baker as police Captain Stacy and Dr. Curt Conner - relatively minor characters on the previous films. However in this movie both are major protagonists. In Ifans case, he also introduces Conner's alter-ego -The Lizard; a bad guy out of Spidey's rouge gallery whose origins are directly tied to Spider-Man's. The extremely talented Emma Stone (The Help) takes over the role of Gwen Stacy played previously by Bryce Dallas Howard. However, this film (staying true to the comic) introduces Gwen as Peter's first love interest. Stone and Garfield demonstrate chemistry that in the midst of all the action tells a sweet teenage love story. Director Marc Webb consulted with 3D guru James Cameron during the planning process which led to the movie bring filmed in digital 3D rather than converted post-production. This brings clarity and crispness to the scenes and the special effects that doesn't detract from nor overwhelm a surprisingly well written script.(Audiences should be aware that beginning with this movie Sony is charging theaters for the 3D glasses which will undoubtedly result in higher prices at the ticket office. Is the additional price justified? Here's a great article to help you decide.)While the writers took some artistic license and modernized some elements of Spider-Man's beginnings, the story essentially doesn't stray far from the heart of the classic origin. Many have said they aren't as excited about this movie as they were/are about the other summer  blockbusters. Had anyone known how good of a movie this would turn out to be I'm sure the Web Crawler's ticket pre-sale would have rivaled all the other heroes of the big screen.",8,3,7,8 July 2012
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," A sequel up to par with the others in the franchise (and genre)
","In 1966 there was a hit television show called Mission: Impossible about an elite covert unit which carried out their assignments with high-tech equipment and elaborate deceptions. Some may argue that this show may have drawn the blueprint for most spy TV shows and movies to follow.Â 30 years later, Paramount Pictures brought the Mission: Impossible to the big screen with Tom Cruise as the major star headlining the action which had been cranked up several notches. The gear the unit used was now ultra-high-tech and the deceptions were mind blowing. Almost all spy/action movies that followed, including the two Mission: Impossible sequels were built based on the design of the 1996 blockbuster.Â But the times, they are a'changin'...well, sort of.Â In recent years the James Bond franchise was rebooted, making it more 'contemporary' by casting Daniel Craig as the latest actor to play Bond in a long line of 007's. For the better part of the last decade, Jason Bourne, played by Matt Damon has pretty much dominated the spy movie genre with Hollywood's rendition of The Bourne Trilogy, a series of novels by Robert Ludlum. Damon has gone on record as stating he will not return for another turn as the amnesiac assassin.I bring up these two points because Mission Impossible â€“ Ghost Protocol, the fourth installment in the Mission Impossible saga that has spanned 15 years, was rumored to be a reboot due to the feeling from critics that the 'franchise is played out and its star over- exposed' after the Mission Impossible III was released. Well, Tom Cruise is back as not only the star but also a producer along with J.J. Abrams who also directed the the last installment. With that being said, not much is different about 'Ghost Protocol' (which obviously not a reboot) from the three previous films.What it is however, is a convincing testament to the capabilities of IMAX technology to capture breathtakingly beautiful landscapes and adrenaline pumping action sequences. Thankfully both director, Brad Bird (The Incredibles) and cinematographer Robert Elswit showcase how IMAX is a serious rival to the over-saturation of 3D movies that have flooded theaters in recent years. As with any successful spy film, the script toes a fine line between being too complex and intricate for audiences to follow and too simple and superficial to adequately motivate viewers into committing their time and money. In this case, Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and the entire Impossible Mission Force has been disavowed by the US Government for alleged terroristic acts against the Russians. It is up to Hunt and his team to prove their innocence while simultaneously save the world from a mad man bent on starting a nuclear war.As I mentioned earlier, not much is different from this film than the others (or any 'good' spy film for that matter) other than the team of agents whom Hunt works with. Paula Patton (Just Wright) plays Jane Carter, an agent with a personal grudge motivating her involvement with the team. Jeremy Renner (The Hurt Locker) plays as IMF analyst who gets accidentally gets involved in the mayhem. Rounding out the team, is Simon Pegg as Benji Dunn, the teams technical analyst, a role he reprises from the last Mission: Impossible III. And although Ving Rhames has been mentioned as being the only other actor other than Cruise who has been in all four 'Impossible' movies, I was very disappointed that he only has a minuscule cameo about the same length of Josh Holloway's (Lost) brief role.Last year Tom Cruise spoofed his Ethan Hunt character in last years 'Knight and Day' showing a bit of a comedic side to his often criticized image, but in M:I Ghost Recon, it isÂ Pegg who at many times serves as a welcome comic relief, playing foil to Cruise's stoic demeanor and attitude.Â Unfortunately, Patton who flirted with an action role in 'Deja Vu' never looks completely comfortable or convincing in her portrayal of an super secret agent just never comes across as more than her 'pretending'. However there is a scene where she does shine briefly, sharing the screen with Anjil Kapoor from Slumdog Millionaire.Â Renner on the other hand, may be the one who reveals Paramount's hand as far as the future of the M:I franchise. Once Cruise or studio executives or audiences decide its time for someone other than Ethan Hunt to lead the team, William Brandt will be a capable replacement, assuming the capable Renner is the actor playing the part.Â Overall, Mission:Impossible Ghost Protocol plays to its strengths; action, action and more action but I cannot understate how much the IMAX experience really enhances the viewers immersion into the film. Not only visually, but the sounds of the film come across as another character.If you're already a fan of Mission: Impossible franchise, go see this installment which is up to par with the others (and the other aforementioned action/spy movies). If you aren't however, don't be afraid to venture out and be amazed at the technology that elevates this movie to being the most memorable out of the Mission: Impossible movies.",7,1,6,16 December 2011
The Bourne Legacy," The Bourne Franchise: There was never just one - but there should've been.
","Film: The Bourne Legacy Studio: Relativity Media, The Kennedy /Marshall Company Cast: Jeremy Renner, Edward Norton, Rachel Weisz Rating: PG-13 Running Time:135 minutesIn 2002 Jason Bourne the amnesiac spy/assassin loosely based off of the Robert Ludlem novels made his way to the big screen. Played magnificently by Matt Damon, The Bourne Identity was a breath of fresh air in the action-thriller genre which had been dominated by movies like 'Mission: Impossible' and the James Bond series. In the following years, two sequels (The Bourne Supremacy and Ultimatum) also starring Damon came along, each tolerable in their own right, both feeding off of the previous story but neither as good as the first.Eventually the quality of the of the scripts were of such poor quality that even Matt Damon distanced himself and moved on from the franchise.  If only the studio made the same move. Supposedly Paul Greengrass, the director of the first three Bourne installments joked about a forth film being titled 'The Bourne Redundancy'which turns out to be ironically appropriate. I submit the even more appropriate 'The Boring Legacy'.Directed by Tony Gilroy, writer of the first three Bourne films, The Bourne Legacy struggles to introduce new characters and attach them to the established narrative. In a nutshell, we learn that the covert program that created Jason Bourne has a sister program run by another clandestine government agency like the CIA. The head of that agency (The Incredible Hulk's Edward Norton) is positive that the events of 'Supremacy' have created an infection which needs to be'cleaned up' - a euphemism for killing all agents involved in the 'Outcome' program. Aaron Cross (The Hurt Locker's Jeremy Renner) is the last of these Bourne-like agents who are  dependent on a combination of pills to maintain their amazing physical and mental skills. He's knows he's being hunted but desperately wants to obtain a refill so not to lose his lethal abilities. Bored yet?  I felt the same way watching. He teams up with a reluctant biologist (Rachel Wiesz) who helped engineer and administrate the 'Outcome' agents and program who is also marked for 'cleansing' as the rest of her team is massacred in a workplace shooting that was frankly, extremely uncomfortable to watch in light of the recent real-life mass murders in Colorado and Wisconsin. What made the first Bourne film so captivating was the intriguing plot that accompanied Bourne's amnesia laced with the action sequences that showcased his innate abilities to assess a situation and appropriately and effortlessly kick ass. And that's precisely where the Bourne Legacy fails. The plot is nothing more than boring and the action scenes not only pale on comparison to and in intensity to Bourne's, Bond's and Hawke's(of Mission: Impossible) they happen so late in the film that they hardly matter since you have literally already seen all of them in the film's trailers. Ironically the tagline to this installment is  'There was never just one.' There probably should've been.",1,25,43,10 August 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," From A Critic Who Lives In Aurora
","I was going to write up a glowing review of Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight Rises, a movie so good I actually screened it twice earlier this week. I told a friend who was 'hyped' about seeing the movie at midnight Thursday, that he wouldn't be disappointed. In my rough draft I mentioned that the IMAX version was larger than life. In my notes I mentioned that in this highly intense PG-13 film most of the violence occurs off-screen. I also wondered if the parallels in the plot to the real world conflict of the 99% versus the elite 1% were intentional. But to paraphrase comedian Kevin Hart $@%$ just got real. I woke up this morning to the shocking news that at a movie theater 2.6 miles away from my house a gunman opened fire in a midnight showing of TDKR. As of this writing, 12 people have been killed and approximately 50 people have been injured including a 3 month old baby. The injuries range from gunshot wounds to exposure to some type of chemical agent. Witnesses say the gunman entered in the theater through a fire exit dressed in what has been described as riot gear including a bulletproof vest. He then released one or two canisters of teargas before opening fire on the unsuspecting audience. Reportedly the killer began the slaughter just minutes into the film which added to the confusion. Many people thought the man standing in the front of the screen with guns and teargas was affiliated with the movie whose main protagonist is a ruthless mercenary/terrorist named Bane.But sadly no, the heartless madman causing the terror inside theater 9 was all too real. Although having not attended I even feel a twinge of anxiety knowing that more than most, that easily could've been me and my family. As I write this a father has just confirmed his 6 year old daughter is among the dead. So, now I submit this as my review of the The Dark Knight Rises - a movie about a hero who rises up against the crime and evil taking over his beloved city.Yes, it's a really, really good movie - the best of the summer if not the year but in comparison to the chaos that marred it's premiere:It's not larger than life. And sadly, most of the violence did take place offscreen. Movies are supposed to be a temporary mental escape from that reality but as they say; some things are truly stranger than fiction. No matter how intense the plot - nothing can measure up to or parallel the senselessness and madness that is taking place in my backyard right now. Reality is, our world doesn't have a Dark Knight to fight the evil that plagues our world. Thankfully, this morning my friend let me know he was physically unharmed although he is a bit shaken up. So many people will be affected and touched by this 'act of depravity' as Gov. John Hickenlooper described it. If you are able to do so; be there for those folks. Even if it's just lending an ear to listen or a shoulder to cry on. We all need to strive to be better than average.Follow me in Twitter @wydeopenClick here if you would like to help or need help.",9,2,6,21 July 2012
