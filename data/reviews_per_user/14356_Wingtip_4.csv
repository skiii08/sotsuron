Who Framed Roger Rabbit," A wonderfully wacky tale of a rabbit, a detective and crime
","Who Framed Roger Rabbit is one of the most entertaining pieces of fluff I have ever had the pleasure of watching. From the opening sequence to the end credits the viewer is bombarded by a series of dazzling colors, a soothing score and lots of special effects. Although the effects in the movie may seem somewhat simple, they are not bad for a film shot before the advent of digital alterations. Bob Hoskins plays Eddie Valiant, a detective who is at times almost as animated as the toons with which he lives. Christopher Lloyd is superb as the evil judge and Roger Rabbit is brought to life by an incredibly energetic comedian named Charles Fleischer, who by the way needs to get more vocal and acting jobs. Roger Rabbit is a must see for any cartoon fan, child and adult alike.",Null,0,0,15 April 1999
Fargo," Fargo: The story of a crime gone bad and a movie gone worse
","Perhaps I am just one of those people who just 'doesn't get' Fargo, but if this is so, I am one of the happiest movie fans in the country. Watching this movie was like having pins shoved into my eyes. Watching William H. Macy arrange a crime with Steve Buscemi was unrealistic and boring. And while some people may have felt that the intentional use of a northern accent was funny, I found it to be extremely annoying. The only amusing part of Fargo was the last scene on the shores of the frozen lake, which was at least original. To anyone considering seeing Fargo for the first time, I say 'stay away, stay very far away'.",Null,0,0,14 April 1999
The Untouchables," An excellent depiction of gangland Chicago
","This film is a masterful blend of violence, suspense and history. The cast not only includes Robert DeNiro, Sean Connery and Kevin Costner, but a bunch of character actors and lesser known stars who support the marquee names. Although not necessarily true to history, Brian DePalma's version of Elliott Ness and his battle with Al Capone includes a terrific dramatic death sequence with Sean Connery as well as a slow motion gun battle in Union Station. A must see for anyone who enjoys mob movies or DePalma's unique approach to directing.",Null,0,1,13 April 1999
Goodfellas," A great movie about real life mobsters
","This has to be one of the best movies about mob life ever made. Watching DeNiro, Liotta and Pesci's characters grow up in a life where theft and violence is commonplace is really something. One of the most amazing things about this film is the way in which Scorcese gets his actors to display such a calm attitude toward one aspect of life and then immediately switch to brutality and killing one minute later. I counted at least three examples of this phenomenon, but I will not explain them, lest I spoil the movie for someone else.Although this movie was released the same year as Godfather III, it still stands on its own, due to the fact that it shows us another, lower level of organized crime. I would highly recommend both Goodfellas and the Godfather III as well as another very well portrayed movie called A Bronx Tale. Finally, if you want to really have a mob movie fest, watch Goodfellas and then watch My Blue Heaven. This is a Steve Martin comedy, but the movie starts right where Goodfellas leaves off.",Null,0,0,17 May 1999
