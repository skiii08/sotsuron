The Longest Yard," The first Adam Sandler movie I enjoyed
","Yes!. I can't believe I finally found a movie where I enjoyed watching Adam Sandler act. I have not seen the original but this was a very interesting and funny movie. It's interesting to see how they get to convince all the cons to play against the guards and not caring for their personal differences. The ending is, of course, predictable: Of course they are gonna win the game and for course it will be by only one point, but who cares? The movie was really fun to watch and it's the first one where Adam Sandler is not playing a mental retarded person. I think it deserves a solid 8. Catchy, good casted, humorous, greatly directed.",8,0,2,5 January 2008
