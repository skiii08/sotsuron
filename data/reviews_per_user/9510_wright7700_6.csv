3:10 to Yuma," Great for a Western
","In recent years, there have not been many westerns which have been as popular and successful as this one. Russell Crowe is so strong here that he actually makes you like the villain in the film, and the well-grounded features of his co-lead played by Christian Bale rub off on him. Crowe and Bale make the film which would otherwise be set aside as just another western in an era where they have not been so popular.Crowe plays the gang leader with sympathy, as a lover, artist, Bible quoter who tries to keep the other psychos in line. Bale is so believable as the scrappy war-injured rancher and family man.I wish that the ending would have been a little different, or more positive for the poor family man just trying to do the right thing. Many things in life are beyond our control, and the major point of this film crystallizes that out all too well.",8,6,12,6 April 2008
Alexander," Doesn't Quite Cut It
","I am not sure where to begin with this one...Angelina Jolie as Alexander's sorceress/mother playing with snakes the the beginning of the film is enough to turn anyone off. I am not sure how much of that is acting if you get my drift.Many character development issues need further defining for me to understand. While the film runs long and complicated, I lost track and interest in this thing too many times. The characters were either not likable (Jolie, Kilmer) or just annoying. I could not get involved and frankly did not care what became of any of them.The special effects/battle scenes could have been spectacular and saved the day but also fell short. Much more could have been done in the travelogue mode with beautiful Greek Islands, but that all went to waste. Take a look here only if you can't find something better.",5,1,2,25 September 2005
Brokeback Mountain," Unforegettable
","There is no way to put into words my feelings about this film--hope, horror, understanding, depression, isolation...The list could go on and on forever. This is not just about a pair of gay cowboys who turn into long term lovers, because it covers facets (money, power, bad in-laws, abusive fathers, abandonment) of many relationships and standards in society. The true themes seem to be poverty and isolation. Regardless of one's personal views and fears, homosexuality has existed since the beginning of time, and it is unlikely that anyone willingly makes that choice. It must be horrible running around in life AC when 90% of the rest of the population is DC. I am a conservative, southern, Christian, straight white male and I believe that it is time for respect and tolerance on this issue.As for the Academy Awards, they must have bowed to peer pressure granting Best Picture honors to Crash. The incomparable Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhall will likely be granted Oscars for later work in lieu of what happened here. They really belted out their roles with sensitivity that grabbed the audience in their seats. These may end up being the two greatest 'male' roles in motion picture history. Heath and Jake could melt paint off the walls in this one. I felt a little worse for the Jack Twist character? Could anyone see Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt even attempting this? FAT CHANCEFor the record, this movie is NOT pornographic, but it certainly gets its point across. Some viewers may wish to get popcorn during the infamous 'tent scene.' While not family entertainment for kids under 12, Brokeback's release is perfectly timed in history and handles the issues with compassion and understanding. (SPOILERS) The best thing about the whole movie is the ending, leaving the viewers wondering what really happened to Jack Twist (murder or accident). Could it be that Jack faked his death to escape his wife's family and catch up with Ennis later? providing for a sequel 'Return to Brokeback Mountain?'10 out of 10 Stars",10,25,29,23 March 2006
Gone with the Wind," Deserves its Legendary Status
","This film is a complicated tale of two intertwined families against the backdrop of the Civil War. Having recently read Margaret Mitchell's original novel, I believe that the film is a loyal attempt to cover her legendary work. While GWTW clocks in at about 4 hours in length, the movie necessarily leaves out many characters (Dilcie, Uncle Henry Hamilton, Will Benteen, Wade & Ella-Scarlett's first two children) who were important in the book. It is understandable why David O Selznick et al had to pick and choose what to include. Wade and Ella in the novel made Scarlett seem like an unfit mother, and that would lessen sympathy and support for Vivien Leigh with the public. Commerical success could not be risked.The Oscars for the movie proved interesting. According to my research, that awful (unattractive) Bette Davis almost beat our Vivien Leigh for the 'Best Actress' trophy in 1939. Clark Gable apparently didn't want to be Rhett Butler and did not lobby for an Oscar enough, having one earlier in the 1930's. Gable came in at least third behind Robert Donat (winner-Mr Chips) and Jimmy Stewart. The Rhett Butler in the book was more severe, dangerous, jealous, and frankly more appealing.It is interesting that little info survives about relations between Vivien Leigh and Olivia de Havilland. Miss de Havilland, now retired to Paris, is apparently a class act and grants few interviews. She has outlived her other major costars by almost 40 years at this point.Every American should study this film.",10,2,3,27 November 2005
Fantastic Four," Critics were too harsh here-good film
","It helps in appreciation of the film if you had followed the comic book as a kid. That being said, the special effects were good but not spectacular. The whole show was stolen by Chris Evans as the Human Torch and to an extent by 'The Thing.' Marvel Comics and this film included are excellent at showing complicated superheroes with personal issues and adjustment problems. I thought the Reed Richards role was weak and could have been more developed.Jessica Alba as the Invisible Woman was the weak link in the whole thing. She is too young for the part, and her talent range just doesn't encompass a serious thirtysomething role. Why was it necessary for her to strip in public? Why did Ben Grimm's finance hand back the engagement ring in that same mob scene on a bridge?? Chris Evans may see a breakthrough from this role, and I would count on a sequel as well.",8,0,1,25 September 2005
Up in the Air," Haunting and all too timely
","This work of art exposes the disconnect in our modern, fast-paced society in ways that have never been explored. Examples are as follows:1)George Clooney's main character lives in a motel room with no pretense of being a real home, very sterile and spartan. He is far from his family emotionally and geographically and does not relate well to other people in many cases. 2)Employers don't even talk with their employees, just hiring another company to come in to terminate them. 3)Big Rust Belt companies are dying on the vine. Mr. Clooney has been to Detroit a lot and says so. Their offices are barren with phones strewn all over the floors and carpet with impressions where the desks used to be. 4)Vera Farmiga is an exquisite job with her role as the love interest. I knew something was wrong with her but just couldn't place it. My friends, family, and co-workers are still complaining about the amoral wanton slut. 5)Of course, there is the obligatory smart-girl new grad from a northeastern school who delivers the bad news the all the laid off employees. This must be quite demeaning to a 62 year old grandfather with a high school diploma. That is often how it happens.Most troubling: All of the people being fired appear to be middle aged, old, fat, African-American, or some other minority. As in real life, they have all been in their positions a long time, earning an above average salary to the point that they are on the radar to be let go. All that vacation, 401k, health care is too expensive for these types of people when you can hire Mayling in China (or Maria in Mexico) for $1 per day.'I'm here to be fired, aren't I?' 'I have plans, there's a bridge near my house, and I gonna jump off it.'All of the main characters, particularly Clooney and Farmiga, do a fantastic job and rattle the viewer to the core with this all too timely work. Just outstanding.",9,0,2,20 December 2010
