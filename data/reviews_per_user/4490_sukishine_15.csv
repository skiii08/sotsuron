Catch Me If You Can," Didn't want it to end
","This movie was really good!  I couldn't wait to see what Frank would do next.  Very entertaining and fun, with excellent acting from DiCaprio, Walken, and Hanks.  Also the fact that it was based on a true story made it even more interesting.  9/10 stars!",9,1,2,31 May 2003
The Others," disappointing and over hyped
","This movie wasn't bad, it just wasn't... very good.  I can't believe it's on imdb's top 250 list.  The concept was very cool, but it just dragged on and on and was very slow.  I kept waiting for it to get really good, I had high hopes... but it never really delivered.My favorite part was the ending, not only cause it was in fact ending, but it was the only exciting part of the movie.Bottom line: cool concept but boring to sit through and could have been done MUCH better.",7,0,0,18 May 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Kick Ass, Yoda does
","I'm not a fanatical Star Wars fan, so I was a little hesitant in going to the first showing at 12:01 on Thursday.  My boyfriend just happened to get tickets from a co-worker of his, so we decided, why not? 
I really enjoyed myself.  This film was a thousand times better than Phantom Menace.  The CGI is great, the storyline great, and... the best part is Yoda.  He kicks ass! 10/10",10,0,0,17 May 2002
Bridget Jones's Diary," I don't understand why everyone loved this film
","or the book for that matter... To each is own I suppose. I kept looking at the clock wondering when it was going to get interesting. I thought I would love this film, being a 20 something woman, but it bored me to tears. The only good thing I can say about this movie is that the marketing was wonderful.  How else would you get sooo many people to actually think they like this rubbish? I would have rather watched paint dry, it would undoubtedly be more interesting.",5,1,1,24 February 2002
Ocean's Eleven," Fun movie
","I wasn't going into this movie expecting much, and maybe that's why I enjoyed it so much.  It wasn't a bad film at all, and it wasn't profound either.. it was just simply enjoyable.  While I'm a huge fan of movies that make you think, mindf*** movies, such as Memento, Donnie Darko, & Fight Club... I also enjoy the mindless, Hollywood'esque', all star, big budget films.  There really isn't much to say other than, sit back and have a good time.  It's a fun movie 9/10",9,0,0,11 May 2002
Blue Crush," Enjoyable, cute
","Okay, so maybe this wasn't the greatest movie of all-time, maybe it was a bit cheesy and unrealistic.  But there's nothing wrong with a little cheese! The scenery was great, the girls were great, the surfing shots were good. If you don't go into this film expecting to absolutely LOVE it, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.  Enjoyable to the eye, and entertaining on a rainy Sunday afternoon.  (I wish they would've developed the 'on the wrong road' sister a little bit more though, they just kind of left that dangling).",9,0,0,23 January 2003
Moulin Rouge!," Beautiful
","For some reason I waited entirely too long to rent Moulin Rouge on DVD.  The day after I rented it, I went out and bought it.  It is a beautiful story about a penniless writer that falls in love with a woman off limits, a woman who sells her body to men.  It's a musical,yes, but it's much more than that. I sat on my couch awestruck for 2 hours.  It's amazing. 10/10",10,1,2,13 May 2002
8 Mile," Good movie, though expected more
","I thought this movie was good.  However, the story moved a little slow.  I was expecting the movie to show more of 'Jimmy's' life after he 'made-it'. I was also expecting a lot more rapping and/or battles.  POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD!!!! The ending scenes were my absolute favorite part of the movie (when he battles at the club) and there should have been more like it in my opinion. BUT hey, I didn't write the screenplay, nor COULD I HAVE written a better one, so who am I to criticize.  All and all I would have to say that I really enjoyed myself.  Eminem (as controversial as he may be) is very talented as an actor, and is especially talented as a musical artist.  I think many people may swear off this film simply because many of his lyrics can offend so many types of different people.  Hey, everyone has a right to their opinion, right?  Even if you HATE Eminem, I'd say give this movie a try before you bad-mouth it.  This is a totally different medium and deserves to be viewed without bias.  9/10",9,0,0,12 November 2002
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Treat for the eyes
","I just got home from the theater, and I'm very pleased with Kill Bill.  The cinematography is awesome,.. amazing.  I've always loved Quentin's movies, and this is the best one yet.  The soundtrack adds the perfect touch to this over the top masterpiece.  All the acting is incredible.  Uma is great, of course.  Props to the girl who plays Go Go - the 17 year old (forget her name, Chaiki something), I love her character.  Her eyes are piercing, and there is just something about her presence that's...unique.  Lucy L. does a great job, and has a very intriguing character whose parent's were both murdered in front of her, causing her to become what she's become.  The anime of her life story is GREAT (and I'm not really one for anime). Overall this is the best movie I've seen all year! 10/10 stars.  Go see it, and when it comes out on DVD, buy it to add to your collection.",10,0,0,18 October 2003
From Hell," Fell asleep
","I was really looking forward to this movie and I was very disappointed.Reasons why this movie sucked*Heather Graham cannot act*Jack the Ripper was never found in reality*Most of the cast (besides Depp who even with great acting couldn't save this film) were sleepwalking through their roles*Heather Graham cannot act*Too many politcal implications*No Character Developement*The investigator chases the dragon and has dreams of the face of the victims?? Why would he never dream of the killer?*Boring, slow*Heather Graham cannot act",4,1,2,19 May 2002
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Read the books instead
","I am a HUGE Harry Potter fan.  The books were great, I finished all four in a span of about 2 weeks.  Needless to say, I was looking forward to seeing the movie.  I was very disappointed.  I raved on and on about the books to my boyfriend, so I decided to take him along.  He's probably wondering what all the fuss is about.  I can tell he just didn't seem to get it. The acting is mediocre to say the least, with the exception of Snape and Dumbledore.  The story skips and people who haven't read the book are left scratching their heads.  The ending is so obviously rushed and Voldemort just isn't cutting it.  The effects were okay I guess, with the exception of Voldermort, and the score wasn't too bad.  But it cannot even begin to compare to the books.  My advice, skip the movie and devour the books...",8,0,0,15 January 2002
A Beautiful Mind," Didn't think I'd like it, ended up LOVING it
","I had many opportunities to see this film and yet I kept passing it by, thinking it just wasn't for me.  I had never really been fond of Russell Crowe, math, Ron Howard, or paranoid schizophrenia.  And just didn't find the subject matter intriguing.  I was mistaken! ****POSSIBLE SPOILERS****This movie grabbed me from the beginning and held my interest until the ending credits.  Crowe took the viewers with him as he plumetted further and further into false reality, and then he took us back out as he was , with the help of his wife and friends, able to control his delusions.  I am pleased that this film won best screenplay, but disappointed that Best Actor did not go to Crowe. He was brilliant, and he has changed my mind about his abilities as an actor.  This movie has gotten some criticism for not staying true to the book and for being too 'Hollywood' and/or 'sentimental'.  To those people, first of all, IT IS A MOVIE, you cannot change that.  Movies and books are different.  Things have to be changed, added, or taken out here and there to make films work, it's that simple.  If you haven't seen this yet, rent it.  Actually, you might as well BUY it to add to your collection.  It is truly a work of art. 10/10",10,0,1,10 August 2002
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Boring, couldn't wait for it to end
","I fell asleep 3 times watching this.  It was boring.  I know they're kids, but the acting was painful to watch.  And what was with Ron Weasley trying to act 'terrified' in every scene?? As I said with the first movie - avoid it.  Read the books.",4,1,2,20 April 2003
A Walk to Remember," One of the cheesiest movies I've ever seen,.. but
","I thought it was great!  Cheesy the entire way through, ESPECIALLY the end. But I enjoyed myself the entire time.  There is nothing wrong with a little Cheese!Mandy Moore was excellent in her debut performance, as was most of the cast. Though I really think that Moore made this movie shine!8/10 starsCheck it out!!",8,0,1,24 August 2002
Donnie Darko," Thought provoking, dark, beautiful
","This was a movie that I heard a lot about before seeing it.  I was told by numerous movie buffs, who all happened to be male, that because I'm a female I wouldn't like this film.  They said I wouldn't understand it, they said I'd be asking my boyfriend questions though the entire film, they said it just wasn't for 'chicks'. This is one of my favorite films of 2001.  I was entranced the entire time. It was so dark, and at times I wasn't sure what was going on.  However, after seeing the movie, going to bed thinking about it, and waking up, I feel I have such a better understanding for it. It's definitely a movie that makes you think.  Lazy movie watchers need not waste their time. There is no movie to compare this movie to.... possibly a mix between American Beauty/12 Monkeys.. however, it stands on it's own as a uniquely individual film.  There really isn't anything like it.10/10",10,0,1,11 May 2002
