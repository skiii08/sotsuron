The Blair Witch Project," Don't listen to the hype!!!
","'The Blair Witch Project', not many people won't have heard of this film. Although directors Sanchez and Myrick are sitting pretty (che-ching!) after the box office success of this movie, many people came out from watching it very unsatisfied.Basically, three student filmakers get lost in the woods while making a documentary about the 'Blair Witch'. They get lost in the woods and some weird stuff happens.The directors cunningly set up a website making the whole thing out to be real, which is when 'Blair Witch mania' began.By the time it was released over in Zone 2, it was riding on such a huge wave of hype that it was never going to satisfy the expectations that preceeded it. Therefore it is in my opinion that this movie is a victim of it's own success.Personally I enjoyed the film. The trick was not to listen to all that was being said about it. I remember watching on T.V an interview with  Myrick and Sanchez, talking about the response in America to the movie:'How scary is the film?' the presenter asked.'Well, people have been vomiting in the cinema while watching it and alot of peole have been unable to not cover their eyes!' replied Myrick.Not that he was lying- but was this because people were scared, OR could it have been motion sickness from watching through a hand held camera??? I'll leave that one for you to decide. Definately worthwhile viewing.",6,0,1,8 March 2001
The Game," More twists and turns than a rollercoaster.
","The Game is not a movie that at first glance would appear to be anything special, yet after the first five minutes you are hooked.David Fincher is fast becoming one of my favourite directors. His ability to execute fast paced thriller/ film noir is bordering on perfect. His style here clearly shows through and adds great depth to the dark and mysterious storyline. Along with an outstanding performance from Michael Douglas, 'The Game' takes you in more directions than a London cabbie.Douglas (Nick Van Orton) is becoming increasingly depressed with his life, his rich lifestyle not making up for the loss of his father when he was at a young age. His younger brother Conrad tries to cheer him up by giving him a very mysterious birthday gift. He involves him in a mysterious game in which Douglas plays out in his ordinary life. Things become very mysterious and things aren't as they first seem.The plot (if a little far-fetched at times) is gripping and what can only be described as 'pure film'. A good supporting cast add to the interest and suspense to this dark thriller.If you enjoyed Se7en and Fight Club, then you are sure to like this.",7,0,1,8 March 2001
Reservoir Dogs," Simple is effective
","Guys and guns eh? Always a great combination for a good movie, but the addition of a razor blade and an ear have made this movie a 'band apart' from the rest.A lot of hype surrounded this movie. In the UK the BBFC withheld its video release for a year! It begs the question- did they actually watch it 'til the end?Violence is definately a major factor, but it seems to do the opposite of glamourize it. Tarantino proves his greatness with this movie, the contrasts and similarities of good vs. evil, law vs. crime are perfect. The famous 'ear' scene (which incidently was shot twice- once using a close up shot and the other the more artistic 'lookaway' shot- Tarantino opting for the latter) is great. What makes it stand out is the song and the dance of Mr Blonde. Michael Madsen is excellent as the psychopathic gang member.If you still haven't seen this movie- go and get it. There's alot more to it than blood and guts.",8,0,2,8 March 2001
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," A melding pot...
","Transferring book to film is always a tricky subject, especially so in this case with millions of children expectantly waiting to see what they'd imagined come to life on screen.Having never read any of the Harry Potter books I went in to see this movie without huge expectations. I wasn't disapointed with the end result, but it must be said that even at two and a half hours it still barely covers what the book must've done. Running length of the first cut was at the 4 and a half hour mark, so it would've been a huge task trimming down to under 3 hours. I felt as though this seems to show in the movie itself. Many characters are introduced yet never investigated, plot threads are given but never uncovered and as a whole it is disjointed and 'bitty'. Chris Columbus has not failed in the sense that the film has that magical fairytale feel to it and that care has been taken in keeping true to the books (to keep the kids happy!).On the whole a fun film, but in my opinion it has franchise written all over it. Keep an eye out for the 'Quiditch' match though, a classic special effects moment.",7,0,0,17 November 2001
