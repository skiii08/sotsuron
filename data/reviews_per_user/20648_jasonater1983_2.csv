The Incredible Hulk," Awesome !!!!!
","One of my favorite Marvel movies. My 12 year old stepbrother loves it. I heard it's a great movie to watch on blue ray. So I bought it on blue ray, and i'm not at all disappointed. I love the story line and graphics are fantastic on blue ray. I thought the old Incredible Hulk movie was just OK. But this one is a little more realistic looking then comic book looking then the old one. A good version for adults and kids alike. And I love the villain. Good thing I didn't rent this from netflix they'd never git it back. lol I do not have a bad thing to say about this one. I hope you give it a chance and enjoy it as much as I did.",9,2,3,19 May 2011
Thor," My family loved it.
",I didn't see it personally but my stepbrother and stepfather did and they invited me. Now I wish I would of went to see it. They had a lot of great things to say about it. And my stepfather said he would like to go back and see it again. And my stepfather doesn't like many movies of this generation. And my stepbrother is 12 and big into Marvel. From what I've heard I can't wait to buy on blue ray and watch it with my little stepbrother. I would recommend this to a family member or friend and I have not personally seen it yet myself. I will see if I can update this post when I have seen it. Being the God of thunder. The plot and story line sound pretty cool to me.,9,14,27,19 May 2011
