Resident Evil: Afterlife," Simply Amazing
","I have just arrived home back from the theatres and I must say I was VERY impressed with the movie! The 3D special effects were fantastic and really gave you a sense of depth. The lighting was also perfect for this post-apocalyptic style of movie and really added to create and mood to the scene. The plot, in my opinion, was fantastic. I was not a fan of the way Resident Evil: Extinction left off with Tokyo, and I was also not a fan of Alice's supernatural destroy everything power. However, this movie was able to create a logical solution to fix the problem, and continue the flow uninterrupted.I was nearly jumping out of my seat when I saw Wesker, (and for anybody who thinks Wesker was taken from the Matrix please at least look at the games first) and Chris Redfield appeared. I am also a large fan of the games, and the personalities of the characters matched up perfect between the two.This is EXACTLY what I was hoping for from a Resident Evil movie. I was satisfied by the first three movies but this one went well above and beyond all my expectations. Fans of the games will also be fans of the movie.",10,12,26,10 September 2010
