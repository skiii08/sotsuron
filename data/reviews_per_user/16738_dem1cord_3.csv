Minority Report," This movie has a major plot hole *spoiler*
","First of all, i like this movie a lot, it's very entertaining and like all good sci-fci it poses some interesting questions.However I make to make one point.  Since Anderton didn't kill Leo Crow or Danny Witwer and Agatha knows that he didn't why didn't she tell everyone what she knew.  She saw that Crow killed himself and she knows that Anderton didn't kill Witwer since she was with him 100% of the time until they caught him, her testimony would have been an evidence in his favor. I mean they can take her visions of the future and the 100% no doubt about it truth, why not her first hand account?   I always thought this was very ironic.",Null,4,5,7 October 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," An intertesting point about Rama-Kandra
","I was watching this movie on DVD when i noticed something interesting. When Rama-Kandra is being led away from the Merovingian's table as Neo, Trinity and Morpheous are walking to the table the music changes ever so briefly as Neo is looking at him.  It becomes an eastern/hindu music, than resumes back to the soundtrack that was playing before he is seen.  I'm not sure what that means, but I find it interesting.",8,0,0,31 October 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," I have many opinions,and wonder what people think.
","I have seen Reloaded 3 times.  REad several comments.  I just wanted to note a few things and see what people think.I am sure we can all go on and on, but some points i want to make.First i am sure the main character's names all mean something.Some i can figure, some i cantNeo = One Morpheus is god of dreams, and talks about them often. plus his ship is Nebuchadanezzar, who had Daniel interpret his dreams in the Bible.Persephone: greek goddess of underworld, also represents spring Merovingian: some sect in Gaul (france), have no idea on that Bane: the word bane, as in 'bane of my existance' others may be obvious like LInk, keymaker even Agent smith. as in a common name, hence a lot of them. I cannot figure what Trinity stands for.  ? holy trinty or something else.I also want to note: When Neo enters the Matrix on his own to see the oracle, the first images we see are a bunch of Jesus Christ items, pictures, candles, etc. and a few buddest ones when the scence goes to the street as he walks (Also note the Heinken Sign)So, what does that mean. Is Neo the savior?
Also, when he meets the Oracle, she offers him candy that when unwrapped looks like the red pill. He takes it and holds, but never eats it.  What does that mean. He wanted it right.Now Neo's converstaion with the Architect.  Neo suggests that the Oracle is the mother of the Matrix and the Architect responds with a scarcastic 'please'. as if she were not.I also notice that right before Neo disables the Sentinels in the real world, Trinity has the apperace of being on a TV through the wreakage down there.  I'm not sure it means anything, but it seems like they look different to me. who knows.And if you have seen the trailer for Revolutions, it makes it seem that Agent Smith is the ultimate villian and  not the machines, since he 'is no longer an agent of the system' and Neo must defeat him for all to survive.anyhow, CommentsThe Oracle seems sincere to me for 2 reasons.  She said she thinks the only way to go in to the future is 'together' suggesting the past hasn't worked. And she doesn't try to hard to convince him she is on his side.  Which seems consistent to me to someone who is sincere.Obviously there is truth in what the ARchitect says, but i dont think you can believe everything he says.  Obviously there are several Matrixes. the Merovingian points out that Neo had predecessors which doesnt make sense until you find out that Neo is the 6th one.  Teh Agents call him anomaly. and Smith says it's happening like before. Execpt for him of course But why will they system crash if Neo takes the wrong door.  I understand that he has powers because he is the anamoly, but why now will the system crach. too coincidental for me.  Like bulls***.  Obviously the machines dont know everything, cause why try and stop Neo if he's gonna go to the source anyhow and they know they cant beat himI dont we will know or can answer the quesitons until the next movie. But i am interested in others ideas.Overall, i enjoyed the movie.  I dont think you can fully judge it until you know how it ends. But it was great.",8,0,0,25 May 2003
