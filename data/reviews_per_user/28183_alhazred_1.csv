The Blair Witch Project," scary as hell
","okay, so it wasn't a great movie.  It wasn't even a good movie. but then was it?  their acting was true, honest, and pure, untainted by hollywood bs or cliches. so what is to watch about this movie?  if you have trouble watching slow movies, don't watch this.  you'll never make it to the end.  but if you plan to be scared, you WON'T be disappointed. this was the single scariest movie i have ever seen.  because of the realness, and it's ability to suck you in and make you think you are there. it just trudges on, terrifying you every time the dark comes.  you know that what comes at night will scare you and the young characters out of their minds; you just hope they don't have to go through another night, and then they do. and another.  and another. i won't try to fight faults in this movie.  i know there are a few, but there's really no sense pointing them out.  it's a work of art to me.  the fear, the palpability of that terror, is the only advertisement or critique it needs. if you haven't seen it, and you are an adventerous soul, watch it with the lights off.  if you've already seen it, and love it as much as i do, watch it again with the lights off, preferrably with someone who hasn't. enjoy your fear.",Null,0,0,12 December 1999
