Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Most disappointing
","This is simply an awful movie: the acting is terrible (with the sole exception of Anikan's mother), the characters unsympathetic and unlovable (Jar Jar Biggs, or whatever, may very well be the worst character ever portrayed in a movie), and the story both lame and incoherent. Special effects and unlimited budget clearly overwhelmed the magic of the first 3 films.",1,4,7,17 January 2000
Spider-Man 2," Quite simply, a great movie
","This is so much more than a super-hero movie. This is a movie that has something -- indeed quite a lot -- to say about loyalty, responsibility, dedication, and self-sacrifice for a higher purpose. The focus of this film is more on Peter Parker than on Spider-man, on the costs of being a super-hero ('with great power comes great responsibility').It is a genuine tour de force, excellent in every respect. This is a superhero movie for people who hate superhero movies and a profound movie for people who hate serious movies and only like 'good flicks.' Don't miss this movie -- and it's certainly better on the big screen than it will be on all but the very best home systems.",10,0,0,12 July 2004
Ocean's Eleven," Delightful -- lightweight but who cares?
","Delightful caper picture, proving that Soderbergh is the best director working today. From an improbable script and a lead (Clooney) who is usually wooden, Soderbergh crafts a fast-moving piece of sheer entertainment. There are no GREAT MEANINGS in the film, only the barest of plots, and yet it's just a great ride. Sit back and enjoy.",9,0,0,31 January 2002
The Incredibles," Most over-rated film of the year
","This really isn't a very good movie. It's just that simple. The story line is weak, character development all but non-existent (the most interesting character is the costume designer who is clearly based in part on Edith Head), and most important it just plain drags. This is not to say that the movie doesn't have its moments. It's in fact a perfectly OK 'flick' but it is nothing special and it is a big disappointment coming from Pixar whose previous work has been so good.We aren't told why Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl were attracted to each other and we don't see much of their relationship. I guess we're just supposed to accept that all superheroes eventually get together, or something like that. Their children are introduced and then sort of float until the plot needs their help. The motivation of Buddy is too easy, not very interesting. The notion that Mr. Incredible is driven from crime-fighting by law suits is inventive and funny. That the government would pay the judgments is -- well, incredible. Comic book superheros do not work for the government or even accept pay from the government. They generally exist more or less in a netherworld between government power and the world of crime. But the Incredibles end up in the superhero equivalent of the witness protection program. To coin a phrase, what's with that?So, overrated and disappointing. Wait for the DVD. I wish I had.",6,0,2,12 November 2004
There's Something About Mary," Funny, really funny and maybe that's enough
","This is a really funny movie in parts. The opening scene and the hyper-dog scene are alone worth the price of admission. I found myself laughing, laughing uncontrollably and this is something that is all too rare in movies these days.However, the plot is as weak as the scenes are funny and the movie d-r-a-g-s at points. The character development is all but nonexistent and if one is foolish enough to take the plotline seriously, one has to make almost constant efforts to suspend disbelief. The end, when it finally gets there, is predictable and limp (no pun intended in this case).Still, go see the movie! You will laugh uncontrollably and for an afternoon's or evening's entertainment, that ain't all bad.",7,0,0,4 October 1998
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Vast improvement on the first; very good movie
","This time they got it right, including first rate acting all around. All the returning cast are first rate this time, including Harry himself who was something less than wonderful in the first movie. Kenneth Branagh is a delight as are the Weasleys's parents. Plot and focus are much tighter this time, omitting some of the subplots which are delightful in the book but discursive on film. Major flaw is the overly drawn-out ending. But any movie that finishes by noting that it is not our talent, but the choices we make that determines who we are has got it exactly right. Definitely recommended.",9,0,0,29 November 2002
Shrek," Rage does wonders for satire
","For adults familiar with Hollywood, this film is a delight. Katzenberg's venom is evident and really funny. This is biting satire and parody that is just about as good as it can get. Of course, those totally unfamiliar with this background will also love this delightfully twisted fairy tale. And while the obligatory happy fairly tale ending is achieved, well, let's just say it too is bigger and better than one would expect. This is one to enjoy over and over.",9,1,2,31 January 2002
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Just plain boring -- and that's the best part
","This is one of those movies that everyone who failed Lit 101 thinks is great because its boring and they can't understand it, just like they found all those classical pieces they read and never understood. Well, just because it's boring and you can't understand it doesn't make it good. It is, in fact, a genuinely awful film that claims to be based on the Odyssey (by Homer). Right, just like Charlie Manson is a Christ figure. One bright spot: the movie is perfect for George Clooney -- it's so bad, one hardly notices that he, as usual, displays no acting talent.",1,9,26,31 January 2002
