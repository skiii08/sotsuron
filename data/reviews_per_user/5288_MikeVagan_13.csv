The Sound of Music," Classic, as it should be!
","The very first and the best option. Classic, as it should be! And the plot and scenery and the game at the highest level. The sound of voices and orchestra is simply amazing.",10,0,0,21 April 2019
Fight Club," Everything is harmonious.
","The movie from the book did not go far. The cast is well-chosen. The game is good enough to give us a full story. There are, of course, little things - but there is no sense to find fault.",9,1,2,17 April 2019
Captain Marvel," If there was no humor, there would be no film...
","The film is pretty good for the MARVEL line. The beginning of the truth is very heavy, were in the middle of the film technical flaws, but the plot and the acting game supplanted everything!
I like it!
It is a pity that the films are not exposed chronologically, but it does not matter. Samuel Jackson - actor who starred in films for years, perfectly revealed his character.
Brie Larson....
Just a brilliant game, believable and bright. Replicas matched as well as possible.The costumes and filming is done very efficiently.With Love...",8,3,5,3 June 2019
The Day After Tomorrow," Serious topic - serious movie...
","Theme is taken very a serious. Catastrophes and climate change on a global scale. Two sides of humanity are also involved:-scientists who are trying to find out what the future holds and what it is connected with-people who do not know what natural anomalies are associated with, who destroy everything in their path and take the lives of citizens in peacetime.There would be no feature film if there were no main characters.
No, not Mr. President. I'm talking about the scientists and his friends and his family.
With regards to acting, given all the very sincere and very thin.
For 2004, in terms of computer graphics - the film is very serious. After all, to convey such a number of disasters, and that it was all very accurate - you need to try.I'm glad I saw that movie. And glad to see that the world has something else to show the audience",10,3,6,26 April 2019
Thor: Ragnarok," Thunder against dirt
","All known category of films marvel - THOR, this time did not disappoint with his story. However, the technical part of the film, for me personally, a little disappointed.The background, which clearly stood in the pavilions was a little unfinished. And it was evident early in the film- some fuzzy details. Again, as always, humor graced the film. Very interesting remarks.
With regards to scenes with character-warlock, incomplete effects pushed very hard on the eyes, because periodically the picture of the characters has shifted so that someone just out of frame.
All in the same the early the Director us gives to know about new characters and about their characteristics. Perhaps, this was suddenly. Brevity is the sister of talent.Sometimes, there were references to the following films. This is with regards to decorations. An interesting technique that asks a lot of questions...and one of them:
'Why was this done?'The technical side of film was disappointing and in the middle of the movie. Not very good computer effects in dark scenes, BUT that doesn't make the movie terrible or less interesting.",8,3,7,4 May 2019
The Hateful Eight," Sentence by hanging!
",Great work of Quentin Tarantino. Great styling of the actors. Everything is felt at the highest level. The scenery is just super. The plot is very interesting and exciting. The story holds you from beginning to end. There is a rod that does not let go of the viewer and keeps him in suspense until the hanging...,8,1,3,23 April 2019
Interstellar," Monumental movie! Titanic work!
","One of the brilliant films in the space and scientific topics. Very interesting characteristic of the children, and the outcome of events for all mankind. The essence of the, as the search for possible pathways for save and return. For the salvation of all mankind... and for the return of loved ones.It is very interesting that there is nothing superfluous in this film. Interesting and sincere acting. Well-chosen props and scenery.
Pleasant and convenient for the viewer's eyes computer graphics.",10,0,1,26 April 2019
The Intouchables," Strong film!
","The plot and shooting are very strong. A very interesting synthesis of serious and Comedy film genres. The acting game is brilliant, outstanding...there are not enough words to describe how it is done perfectly from in terms of acting.Really need the contrasts of the insertion present in the film. They allow you to completely disclose the characteristic of the character, to understand its opposite side of the coin.
And it worked!",10,1,2,26 April 2019
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," To hell with the codex!
","Pirates of the Caribbean all movies are good. But as practice shows:
The best movie is the first, then each new part is a little worse... with defects.
The cast is good. But everything sometimes spoils the graphics or the defect of the plot.",7,0,0,24 April 2019
Transformers," 'Transformers in stockings.'
","Unlike their followers, this part is better and more interesting. Great acting and special effects. For those who love action, cars and robotics.
Very interesting the beginning of, unlike his continuation of - 'Transformers in stockings.'",7,1,1,21 April 2019
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Look into the future
","This film is one of the most successful roles of johnny Depp. And perhaps one of the most successful works of Tim Burton.
Sorry, but for 2005 the flying Elevator IS GREAT!
Such special effects. Small people with the element of combined filming.
The plot is very interesting, sometimes fantastic. Styling is great. And with regards to 'look into the future' the scenery is stunning.",9,0,1,23 April 2019
Arrival," Strange symbols
","One of decent films on space topics. Very interesting characters are shown, including an alien mind. The plot is very interesting. An interesting finding that shows not two sides of the story, and three. Side scientists, side aliens, and the side of the military.That is, the two sides are trying to establish contact when the third from his fear begins to put a spoke in the wheel and play 'patriotism'.Great acting. Well presented special effects and props.",9,1,2,23 April 2019
Warcraft," Not bad...
","Considering that the film is based on the game, the characters is not enough. Orcs in the film are very human than in the game. And the Alliance feature too serene.
With regards to the plot - good. But if the ice King story were added, the movie would be great. Well... something missing?",7,0,0,23 April 2019
