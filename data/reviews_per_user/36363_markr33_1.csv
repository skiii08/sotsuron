50 First Dates," A very cute romantic comedy, a little too heavy on the comedy (possible spoiler)
","This was a very nice romantic comedy.  The genre is often tough, especially when one of the lead actors tends to be casted more towards comedy than romance.  In this case, Sandler did an excellent job at the romance part of it, and, as always, does a good job at the comedy part.  I think the producers should have laid off some of the physical comedy (that Sandler is excellent at, but in this case nearly all of it is done by the supporting cast members) for this film.  As a matter of fact, the romance alone could have carried it very well.In short, with just the right amount of romance, and a little less comedy, this would have rated even higher.",8,0,0,15 February 2004
