Iron Man 3," Brilliantly delivered, BUT..
","WOW, too many emotions, wowâ€” first of all, this is the first time I watch one of the IM movies in the movie theater. I've watched the previous ones in DVD, so the experience wasn't as much enthusiastic and exciting as watching it on the big screen! And in 3D! It was SO fun! The movie looks and sounds so 2013! I mean the high level of visual and sound effects + the 3D animation is so impressive and let's say that this is what the movie is all about! Those effects are the core essence of the movie! Modern technology at its best peak, and the movie industry have never been prouder! Kudos for all the hard work bringing this movie, technically speaking, to life (in terms of Professional editing and all the perfection that came with it). You can clearly tell that in 5 years (since the first movie came out) the franchise has been progressing(concerning the Special Effects crew and all the magic of the Green Screen). It is truly remarkable. And brilliant. So once you put on those 3D glasses you let yourself go! You're inside, and just having the best time of your life!Now, to some more important stuff, let's talk about the main villain! (or shall I say 'one of the two main villains'). But before that, let's say that Marvel has successively and cleverly presented the waiting viewers with a well-edited trailer! A one in which it truly made you believe in one chain of events, one enemy, and one plot. And then you think that you had it all figured out. Nope, at some point halfway through the movie, you hear yourself screaming (WHAT???!! Are you KIDDING ME??). That wasn't what I expected at all. I'm insinuating, here, the real identity of 'The Mandarin'. What was shown in the trailer as all that raged ' you'll never see me coming' man of terror, supposedly being Tony's main antagonistic opponent, all that is apparently nothing but a play starring the so called actor 'Trevor', hired by Killian (the *coughs* real enemy, this time) in order to hide his satanic, evil plans from the world, camouflaging his identity from being exposed. Such a loss to find out that all of what Sir Ben Kingsley showed in his half-evil character during the first half of the movie, turned out to be a part of his very same character being a simple actor pretending to be evil. Personally, I would've loved to see (if we want to turn away a little bit from the comic-books plot restriction)- I would've loved to continue to see The Mandarin in his evil self during the whole movie, and to be Tony's only enemy, so as to be eventually destroyed by Iron Man (this is a classic, superhero, stereotype interpretation of how the movie would normally end). But maybe the shift in the events was already the point in the very first place, maybe this was the director's aim (and the screenwriter's as well), to make us expect the unexpected. But this wasn't the way it used be to with Jon Favreau's Iron Man 1 & 2. Mr Favreau's directing is so fascinating simply because it goes like 'this is exactly how it's going to be, no surprises, no unexpected shift of events. Just pure entertaining smooth plot'. Now I'm not, in any way saying that Shane Black's directing lacks something, no. It also has a special kind of its own. But, this is what makes the difference. Now you can clearly feel the huge amount of differences when you make the comparison between Mr Black and Mr Favreau's perspectives.Another (somehow) evident thing; the big amount of sci-fi violence and the rather disturbing (for some) graphic nature of this 3rd part, (concerning all the fights and 'stuff-breaking' moments). The 'Soldiers from Hell' - as I like to call them - were, yes, very, very, disturbing (and watching them hurt Tony, was actually one of the hardest thing I could ever watch) I also thought, the graphic nature in this part of the franchise wasn't really kids-friendly. If a lot of adults found themselves rather uncomfortable watching some of the scenes, how about children and teens, then? (this angle-view is subject to discussion and open to different interpretations, of course.)Finishing on the lighter side, concerning the movie in general. Iron Man 3 is really funny. And a real fun to watch too. One of the things you'll enjoy, is RDJ's sense of humor in this movie. It is the one aspect that added to the humorous side of the movie.Another two thumbs up for the music this time as well. Whoever set eyes on Brian Tyler as the main composer of the Score, has definitely chosen wisely. Superhero Music has never been more Epic and it is perfectly fitting the movie's mood. Such music that would send shivers down your spine while you're gazing at the beauty of the image, thus the movie is simply a Treasure of never-ending pleasure!AND! the Science Bros at the post-credit scene? Brilliant. Just brilliant!The movie is undoubtedly and completely different from its two predecessors in terms of directing and the technical stuff, and also in terms of the general view. You'll certainly feel that this isn't like before. This is a new touch, a new taste, a new look and a new perspective of the Armored Avenger's life. Only the glorious, gorgeous people carrying the main lovable characters are the same, amazing us all the more. I really loved and enjoyed the movie. (except for some things, of course.)But I would definitely want to watch it more than just once and can't wait to get the DVD. This one should be kept in everyone's movie collection.",7,0,5,5 May 2013
