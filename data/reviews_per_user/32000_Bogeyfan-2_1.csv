The Blair Witch Project," What a ripoff!
","I had eagerly looked forward to a genuinely creepy movie, but all I got out of the experience was a queasy stomach and a big 'so what' feeling - not even a hint of the supposed terror that the movie would instill. Many in the audience in my theater greeted the movie with a chorus of 'boos' at the end, a sentiment which I shared. I didn't get the slightest chill out of this monumentally disappointing effort. I knew it was a fake documentary going in. Maybe it would have made a difference if I thought it was real, but I doubt it. It was boring, stupid, lame, and bland. For real creepiness, try the original Night of the Living Dead, Rosemary's Baby, or The Exorcist.",Null,1,3,25 August 1999
