Iron Man 3," A Great Success 3
","The last month I saw the movie 'Iron Man 3', directed by Shane Black. On a personal opinion, I really enjoyed the movie for the many aspects it had. Not only is this movie filled with a suspensive action, but it also shows many of the problematics in today's society like government corruption and sentiments for others. It also has the best special effects that I have seen in a movie so far. Not only does it have all of this aspects that I like to find in a movie, but I also am a fan of the 'Iron Man' storyline and the Marvel franchise. The story takes place in the United States. The main plot of the story is how Tony Stark, the main character of the film, tries to redeem himself after the villain named The Mandarin takes control over the war on terrorism, and how he must protect his loved one, Pepper Potts all at the same time. So not only does he have to defend against this terrorist who has created a very powerful weapon, but he also has to save Pepper from him. Throughout the story, we can also enjoy many of Tony's gadgets such as the 'Iron Man' and his super intelligent computer named 'J.A.R.V.I.S.'. As he undergoes this dangerous adventures, his best friend, James Rhodes, helps him to uncover the many secrets of the Mandarin and try to kill him.When it comes to acting, I think that Robert Downey Jr. (Tony Stark), is one of my favorite actors. The way he develops his role is not only creative, but very realistic, so the person that sees the movie really gets into the character and sometimes may familiarize himself with him. Robert takes this role into a whole new level, and as we have seen in the previous movies of this trilogy, he uses a lot of sarcasm and crude wording in order to fit perfectly in this egocentric millionaire that is Tony Stark. Now let's talk about Pepper, or as known in the real world, Gwyneth Paltrow. I think that just as Robert, she has really made her character really realistic and many women try to identify in it. I think that from all the movies she has made, this trilogy is definitely the best paper that she has represented. She has grown so deep into the character, that I have sometimes difficulties telling if her real name is Pepper or Gwyneth. I think that both of these actors make the perfect couple in order to give an action based movie with a little bit of sentimentality in it. They both make the movie funny, entertaining, full of action, and loving. As I previously mentioned, this trilogy is my favorite portion of movies. I can watch all of this movies a thousand times and never get bored, but why? The answer is really simple, the storyline. I think that the director and the scriptwriter have made an excellent job when it comes in creating this films. They make the films full of a little bit of everything. Just by being Iron Man, it has to have that action that gives us that butterfly feeling in our stomachs, and ties us the idea that we want to be indeed Tony Stark. They also give it the love part, since it has this idea of trying to save the person one loves the most in the world from a terrorist and a potential world war triggering person. This brings me to the next point, its special effects. The special effects in this movie are ridiculously good. Since the beginning of the movie when we see Tony Stark in his brand new armor, till the very end with all of the explosions and all of the advanced technology in it. The special effects are so good that one feels that one is part of the movie, and not just a spectator watching it from a couch with a bag full of popcorn and a big beverage. There are just some scenes in this movie that makes are jaw drop to the bottom because of all of the amazing special effects one can find. Every movie has its theme, but I think that this one has many themes. The first one and most important one I believe it is love, and how no matter what the situation is, love will always prevail. But on the other hand, it also shows how destructive many of the future technologies may be and how they can change the life of millions of persons in a matter of days or even hours. It also has a political view, and how sometimes the government doesn't do all of their job when they do a mess. Last but not least, it shows terrorism, and how this idea of destroying cities just to give a message is really unnecessary. I believe that this are the main themes of this movie, generalized in a way so that I don't soil the movie for many of you readers.I believe that this is a movie for teenagers to above because not only does one have to have a basic knowledge on some ideas and terms, but also because of its big violence, although not bloody, there is still violence. The movie is rated PG-13, and I completely agree with this. My final comments on the movie is that it is a must-watch and a very good movie.My rating would be a 9/10 since it may be my favorite movie. My name is Oscar Diaz.
