Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," A whole new Holmes
","Guy Richie's interpretation of the much loved novel character Sherlock Holmes will be despised by any fans of the books or the original films. Luckily for me I'm not one of them. Yes It's much closer to Hollywood than Baker street and yes It's filled with slapstick humour, but none of this takes away from Robert Downy Juniors quite brilliant take on Sherlock Holmes or for that matter Jude Law's performance. Unfortunately we see a very male orientated performance with amazing unused female talent. Then again Stephen Fry's slightly arrogant, camp upper class performance deserves all the attention it receives. So why a 9 out of ten? Because as you watch it you forget all of the negatives. So what there are slightly too many slow-mo shots, an abundance of slapstick, less emphasis on Sherlocks intellect and more explosions than a bond film. You'll be way too engrossed in the pure brilliance of the film to worry. It's hilarious, witty and filled with more action than you could of ever hoped for. A must see. Just think less of the past and more of the future of Sherlock Holmes and you will love it.",8,1,2,15 January 2012
The Grand Budapest Hotel," The Grand Budapest is as Wes Anderson as it gets.
","I love Wes Anderson and his style as an auteur, do not mistake my comments on this film as anything but pure admiration, however if you're not familiar with his style do not go and see it.I remember watching my first ever Wes Anderson film and being in slight bewilderment of what on earth was going on, so when I saw a couple leave the cinema no more than a hour into the film I understood why. Wes Anderson's films are a lot of things, universal is not one of those things. Gut wrenchingly funny is also another phrase that should be avoided when describing a Wes Anderson film to someone unfamiliar with any previous works.Quirky, colourful, unique, well-made, superbly edited and overall mesmerising are all much more appropriate descriptions of The Grand Budapest Hotel. Suspend your disbelief and enter the slightly obscure world that this film exists and you'll find yourself caught up in a thrilling story which you never quite know where it will take you next.A story which in my opinion is far more well-thought out and defined than most previous films by Anderson, something very much welcomed. Also the lack of extremely awkward love stories is quite relieving. Although Ralph Fiennes, M.Gustave, does have what some would call 'odd-relations' so maybe I should retract that comment.One aspect that must be mentioned is the acting, which as usual is without fault. As would be expected from such a cast. What I'm trying to say is if you love Wes then you'll love this fantastical addition to his film collection. The ending however may leave you wanting more but an open ended film leaves space for creativity and imagination so maybe that's a plus after all.Oh Wes, you've done it again",8,2,10,17 March 2014
