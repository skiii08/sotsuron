Howl's Moving Castle," Form more important than function? Spoiler
","In this movie, form is more important that function. We go from one pointless subplot to the other just so that we can see these wonderful and enchanting images of worlds we have never seen. The movie never comes together because the creators (director, etc) are too busy making sure they create beautiful images and scenarios. I don't see it as a poetic anti war movie. The book may do that, but this movie is not about anything. In the UK version it is not clear why Howl gives his heart to calcifer. It is not clear why Howl, knowing all his problems would be solved by putting his heart back in, doesn't do it --hey, the heart was always there! It is not clear why the witch of the waste wanted Howl's heart. And it is not clear why the Sophie's mother all of the sudden appears in the movie in the place where she used to live. What happened to the hat shop that it was empty for them to move back in. Pointless. I hate it when artists think form is more important than communicating with audiences.",2,34,62,28 September 2005
Hostel," SPOILERS...Don't waste your time
","When I was 14, my main goal in life was to find soft porn movies like this one. At 34, this movie feels indulgent, sophomoric, silly and boring. The whole 20 minutes in the Netherlands were a soft porn movie. No real story line, no reason, mo nothing. A minute of them in a dutch hostel leaning about this other one would have sufficed. Then the movie goes from soft porn to silly gore. The dutch businessman who was not gay but wanted to be a surgeon, the local community that is running the killing machine business because they have nothing better to do (no real explanation is given about this operation and it is likely that a sequel will happen, god forbid). Then the killing of likable characters (OK, OK, that means that they went against the formula, but everything else was formula, so it was indulgent to kill the likable characters and leave charmless Jay Hernandez alive). All in all, the best part of the movie was the American business man deciding how to kill. he explains the story in that energetic powerful little scene. But it is not worth the time or money.",2,0,0,14 April 2006
Inside Man," It never comes together
","This movie never comes together. I think the problem with this movie is that the story is actually very basic, very tight and very logical. There are no great surprises or smart comments or shocking discoveries. It is about a guy who has watched previous heist movies and is now doing one himself. Period. But the movie is directed as if the whole thing was bigger than that, with these angles and shots making you feel that you are about to be dazzled by what you are about to see. But no, it is an intimate, small, cute entertaining movie. Yes, it was a delight to see Jodie Foster play the beautiful manipulating minx, but most anyone in Hollywood could have played that role. Denzel's sidekick is a very well known actor in the UK and was vastly underutilized in this film. Mr Washington was playing the same character he has played in the past what 5 films? In my humble opinion, it was boring to watch him do the same thing. All in all, I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.",5,2,5,1 May 2006
The Da Vinci Code," Never seen such a strong unjustified media campaign against a movie
","Never seen such a strong unjustified media campaign against a movie. We went to see this film yesterday despite the fact that every single review said the movie was dull, lacked spark, was poorly made, etc, etc. To our surprise, Tom Hank's hair wasn't distracting, and we were pleaseantly entertained and amused by the whole thing. The British actors steal the show, no doubt, and we have seen Tom hanks do better. But the movie delivered the goods solidly. The only weak link in the movie is the otherwise amazing Audrey Tautou. We have seen the french actress devour the screen in Amelie, Dirty Pretty Things and a few others. She is an accomplished actress, no doubt. In this movie, she was acting in some scenes, in others, i think the director told her she wasn't going to be in the scene and she was flat,amateurish and dull. So I fully recommend it, forget the reviews, don't know why they are so against this film. And it is fantastic!!!",9,2,5,22 May 2006
