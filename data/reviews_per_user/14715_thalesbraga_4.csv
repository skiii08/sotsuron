Hereditary," Too much or too little?
","I can understand why this movie is being so much acclaimed and spoken of, but in the end its just a sick plot put in a movie. Don't get me wrong, its indeed a well detailed and constructed movie, but it is still a sick plot, which lacks better explanation either from the beginning or at least in the end, when even the King clearly does not understand what just happened with him or with his mom and what he is supposed to do with it. In addition to that, I have to disagree with whom states it is a well directed movie. It is not, as the director uses 2 hours whereas the first could be done in 20 minutes, while the movie really happens in the last 30 minutes. It is a clearly attempt to make a anthological horror movie just like 'It' and 'Run' did recently, but without its strong content, lessons learned and solid endings, just a plain sick crazy twisted plot.",5,0,3,29 August 2018
