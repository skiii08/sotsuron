Ford v Ferrari," Top 10 of 2019
","I didnt know what to expect of this movie but it is one of my favorites now. The story line is not confusing, theres good guys and bad guys. Theres humor and awesomeness. I agree with a lot of people who have reviewed this movie: this movie will make you want to learn now to drive stick shift! It was so awesome and the racing felt intense and badass. Christian Bale is a wonderful actor and Matt Damon was superb! Damon deserved to be nominated for an Oscar for this movie. Both him and Bale had really good chemistry. The only negative thing I will say is that there was no backstory to how both of their characters met. You assume they already knew each other at the start of the film. Other than that, loved the film and is one of my favorites.",10,1,2,7 February 2020
Knives Out," Not all that
","Who dun it? knives out is rated a 8/10 so i figured i'd watch it for myself. honestly, this movie is a solid 7 at most. its definitely not the best movie of the year but it has its moments. everyone did shine in their roles, but daniel craigs accent was unnecessary. his british voice would have made the movie much more pleasant and entertaining. at times the movie did drag but that tends to happen in 2+ hour long movies.",6,5,10,1 December 2019
Revolutionary Road," The family on revolutionary road
",Sam Mendez is such a great director. He really knows how to make something serious very real for the screen. The soundtrack gave me chills with every scene because it caused mystery among the storyline. Are they gonna be ok? Is something bad going to happen? Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio have wonderfuly chemistry throughout the whole film. They actually seem like a married couple who dont know what to do anymore. Sad movie but a must see,7,1,1,2 February 2020
1917," Beautiful and Deserving
","1917 will captivate you from the beginning to the end. There is never a dull moment in this journey of a film. The movie was filmed in one shot so you reallt feel like youre travelling with them. From the walks towards the horizon, to the explosions, you will feel what they feel and love the movie as a whole. Truly mesmorizing and definitely recommend worth watching.",10,3,7,11 January 2020
Parasite," 'I heard, so I conquered'
","The movie has high ratings and after what the director said about getting over subtitles, I had to give it a go. Parasite is not bad but I wouldnt give it a 10. Its a beautiful film and I loved the comedic storyline. However, I did not like when they introduced the ex-housekeepers husband hiding down in the basement. I felt like that whole plot felt messy. Like they started something and didnt know how to finish it so they just did something random. Maybe that was supposed to be the point, but it messed with the comedy that the movie began with. Parasite went from being witty and funny, to trying to be a suspense-horror film and it just didnt go well together.",6,2,10,23 January 2020
The Silence of the Lambs," a must see
","Its not a scary movir, but it is realistic horror. a canibal helps an fbi agent track a criminal who has yet been discovered. didnt understand the title refrence nor the purpose of him stuffing cacoons in his victims throats but it was a good mystery film",7,1,2,27 January 2020
Jojo Rabbit," Its good
",Jojo rabbit is a good movie. it starts of being a comedy but then it gets more serious. this movie is about a 10 year old learning the diffrence between what is right according to the majority and what is right from the heart.,6,2,4,9 February 2020
