The Devil's Advocate," a silly film
","this movie might be entertaining or even extremely entertaining to some people who don't expect a lot from a film. there is no hint of subtlety here in any of its long string of insipid & contrived scenes. it is all bombast, all the way. the ending just drives this point home to no purpose & at great length. al pacino has probably never turned in such an unchallenging performance. he just grabbed the cash for this one & did the obligatory scenery-chewing which he can be sooo good at in decent films. what a waste of a great talent. keanu reeves, a much underrated actor who has turned in some magnificent performances in truly wonderful films, and who has turned in a small handful of horrible performances in some great & some stupid films, really outdoes himself here. his acting is so embarrassing, it rivals the Dracula thing he tried to do. & that was an interesting film from an interesting director! keanu's even been really great in some really terrible films! but this is just one of those that's so bad, YOU feel embarrassed FOR him. the 'plot' is contrived & useless. pacino & reeves even had a much-publicized, bitter, loud & contentious blow up about reeves' acting on this one. reeves' reply when quizzed by the press about this: 'it doesn't mean i should stop TRYING to be a better actor.' he's a truly humble & talented man. -bobby cormier",2,12,28,19 February 2005
