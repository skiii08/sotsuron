Marie Antoinette," The Most Boring Movie I've Ever Watched
","This movie was a total snooze fest.Considering the time period and everything that was going on this could have been sooooo much more interesting.I don't know how they managed to make it this boring, but they did.The entire first hour is a waste, it could have been cut in half and would have at least made watching it a little more bearable.Hunting, breakfast, shoes, bed with no sex, gossip rinse wash repeat for the entire first hour.How do you make revolution boring? An inherently exciting thing? The end of the movie was even boring.This movie never has a climax (much like the King of France) none of the characters are round. I couldn't give a crap about any of them, AT ALL.",1,0,0,2 August 2015
