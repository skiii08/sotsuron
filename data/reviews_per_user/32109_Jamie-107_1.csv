Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A beautiful start to Lucas' culture-defining masterpiece
","Never before had I seen a film, where the audience (at least 20% of them) dressed up as the characters.  Nor had I heard a reaction quite like the roars that traveled through the aisles upon the title sequence.  Surely, this would be something special.The first thing to notice is the way in which Neeson seems almost born for the role.  When he utters the line 'There's always a bigger fish', you can't help but feel he does a better job than the po-faced Guinness as the old-timer Jedi.McGregor has a relatively small role in the film, but does show potential for his much more critical role in the next two films.  But huge credit must go to Lloyd, who easily disproved any negative statements by the US press. The scene in which he leaves mother is certainly one of the most moving in the saga to date.But Star Wars just wouldn't be Star Wars, without heroic battles accompanied by a pounding Williams soundtrack.  This film doesn't fail, with a wonderful dogfight in the stylish Naboo-fighters, an epic ground assault (on the pre-empire, lush green fields) and the most exciting lightsabre dual you've ever seen.  But the marvelous centrepiece to this film is the podrace, it will, quite honestly, blow you away.One small concern for the future is that we all know 'what happened next'. The big revelation at the end of 'The Empire Strikes back' was one of the biggest bombshells in cinema history, I don't know how this achievement can be repeated in II & III.  Although, I wouldn't bet against George having something up his sleeve.In the mean time, Anakin, I sense much fear in you",7,0,0,21 January 2000
