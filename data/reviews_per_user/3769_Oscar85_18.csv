Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I'm glad I saw this one
","People I knew told me this movie was I waste when it was in the theatres, so I took their advice and stayed away from it. This was a mistake. When it came out on video the following Spring, I watched it and loved it. Lucas keeps the spirit of Star Wars alive. Out of 10, this one gets a 9.",10,8,10,17 January 2002
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A great start
","This movie is terrific and just as good as the first three. I loved all the characters, the worlds explored, the eye candy, and the mysterious storyline. It is just as I expected the Star Wars saga would begin, with strife slowly growing in the fabric of the great Republic. It doesn't run too long either. I can't say I'm a bona fide Star Wars fan; I just love great stories. Star Wars will be a story I will love experiencing again and again once all six episodes are together. This installment may have let some people down because it didn't answer all their questions, but I love its mystique and childlike spirit. It will be a great beginning for the dark chapters that are likely to come. I can't say enough about how fun this movie is. Placed historically alongside the first three movies, it cannot be near as great, but once it's one of six, the entire saga will shine as the greatest example of how great one's imagination can be. The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones, Episode III, A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi--how I will love them all. And how I wish I could personally thank Mr. Lucas for this incredible gift. I just can't wait for May 25, 2005, oh how great that day will be. It's great just to get away from this gawdawful mess of a world for a few hours and experience something not quite like anything else. I only wish more people could enjoy this movie, but that's their loss.9.5 out of 10",10,8,10,17 January 2002
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Brief follow-up
","And I know that I'm not the only fan of this film. Where did all the Star Wars fans go? I can't see you. Stand up and be counted. Over time, the entire six episodes of the series will transcend all present trends and its critics will be made to accept it. Gosh, I don't know anymore. This is why I so loath public opinion. I forgot to give it a rating last time around: As a critic: 6.5/10 As a fan:     10/10 <and this is the voice I will always listen to -And the typo in my previous statement of 'the originals were to masterpieces of filmmaking, I meant to say were not masterpieces of filmmaking,' but who cares what I think anyway? To the fans of this film, have a most happy future, and to all those idiotic nitpickers, stop trying to act so mature!",10,4,8,17 December 2001
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," As a film, bad; but then again, so were the first three; that's what we all love about them
","Hello people? Isn't this film just like the original three, or has it been that long since you've watched the original Trilogy? The reason I love Star Wars so much is that the films don't care about the standards of the time, they just aim to please, and for me I couldn't be anymore pleased with the entire series. What did you people expect? Star Wars was so built up over time that you just forgot that they are only movies, never to be taken seriously! I don't believe the world I live in anymore! Hypocrites! Don't act so mature and watch the movies not as critics but as fans, and you'll enjoy them maybe like you never have before. Phantom is just like originals, embrace it, the originals were to masterpieces of filmmaking, they were masterpieces of pop culture, and Phantom should've been part of it, if you idiots hadn't overanalyzed it to death. It's time like these I wished I was living in a less 'educated' society.",10,0,1,16 December 2001
Minority Report," A striking film with a brilliance you cannot take for granted
","Spielberg once again proves why he is the amazing filmmaker he is. Minority Report's clever noir tale of a 'pre-crime' officer's quest to discover how and why he is soon to commit a murder is as fresh and unique as any spun on the screen in the last several years. Just the idea of it is enough to captivate the viewer, but Spielberg's direction makes for a pay-off ten times greater than one could imagine. Everything that could work in this film does and works in a way the viewer didn't see coming. Summing up the merits of this film is impossible because they are merits incapable of being condensed. It is a movie entirely free of convention and tacky hollywood cliches. One really fun trip into the mind of the greatest mind in the movie business. Easily the best movie of the year and one of the finest ever made.

Amistad," A Overlooked Gem
","Spielberg hits the jackpot again, telling another story about the struggle of mankind. I could see how long this film took in the way all the events flowed perfectly. It should have received more praise for all the work that was put into it. Great performances by Hopkins, Hounsou, Freeman, and McConaughey.10 points out of 10",10,0,1,23 March 1999
Glory," A truly great piece of American film-making
","Once the first frame of Glory rolls, the incredible power and greatness of the film last for 122 great minutes and never die down. To sum up the greatness of this film in just once paragraph would be an impossible task. The acting, the story, the cinematography, the sound, the direction, as well as James Horner's immortal music make surely make Glory one of the three greatest films in American history.",10,0,0,23 March 2000
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The best yet of the new trilogy
","The new trilogy cannot in any way be compared to the first. This one is synthetic, technically-driven, and far from the innocent simplicity of the first three entries.When 'The Phantom Menace' was released in 1999, a large percentage of the Star Wars devotees fell away, and such was to be expected. The feeling of the film was different--distant, esoteric at times. But this is an entirely new set of films and entirely new sets of objectives. Now that a second entry is in the books, perhaps the animosity toward Lucas and his new creation can go away at last.'Attack of the Clones' is startling, mystifying, dazzling, provocative, and fun through-and-through. It employs the eye-candy graphics initiated with 'The Phantom Menace' and takes them to a whole new atmosphere. Even though the film is 95% computerized, one can still feel a part of the picture, another spectator in the arena. The writing was refreshingly better than that of 'The Phantom Menace.' Full of quirky exchanges and chilling references of things to come, the script manages to keep the movement of the film fluid while not getting too bogged down in the politics of the story. A finely crafted dialogue and delivery onto a screen filled with enough going on to thrill even the biggest skeptic.The last half-hour of the film puts the viewer on a conveyor belt, sets the speed to hyperdrive, and throws them straight into the door leading to Episode III. After seeing the film at 12:01 on the morning of 16 May, there was a great deal of material there to sink in. I am quite confidant that this film will appeal on many, many levels and take its place gracefully on the shelf next to 'The Phantom Menace.' And when all is said and done for this prequel series, movie lovers will have two wonderfully unique trilogies to sink their teeth into, for many years to come I hope.
'Attack of the Clones' gets a 7.5/10",10,0,0,20 May 2002
Saving Private Ryan," The Best Film of 1998
","No matter what the Oscars said, Saving Private Ryan was the best film of 1998. It's realistic recreation of the horrors of war make it worthy of praise for years to come. Another top-notch performance from Hanks, as well as a memorable performance by newcomer Jeremy Davies. Great job, DreamWorks!10 Points out of 10",10,0,0,23 March 1999
Saving Private Ryan," Absolutely unforgettable
","This is one the most important films of the 90's and another great in Spielberg's close to perfect career. Tom Hanks is extraordinary as always, and the supporting players create the perfect ensemble cast. The 25-minute recreation of D-day is the most realistic war sequence ever made. Every detail was paid close attention to in the making of this extraordinary motion picture that has become possibly the greatest war film ever made.",10,0,0,28 August 2000
Schindler's List," A perfect film
","To sum up Spielberg's masterwork in one word is a nearly impossible task, but I have come to the conclusion that Schindler's List is perfect. Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler is truly great in recreating the role of a modern day Moses. Making this film all the more compelling is John Williams' perfectly composed original musical score. This film deserves all the awards bestowed upon it, especially best picture by the National Board of Review and the Academy and the Academy Award for best director Steven Spielberg. It deserves all these awards and more. Schindler's List is a film that everyone should see and appreciate to its fullest extent. Spielberg will remain an immortal filmmaker through the work he put into this film.",10,270,523,23 March 2000
Schindler's List," Spielberg's Finest
","When AFI declared this as one of the ten best films of all-time, they were right on the money. Certainly an all-time classic, the film conveys the emotions of the Holocaust Jews like never before. The Holocaust was one of the darkest periods in the history of mankind and only a man like Spielberg could describe it exactly as it was. An absolutely perfect film.10 points out of 10",10,9,14,23 March 1999
Titanic," Bloated wreck
","I don't know quite how to describe this film. When it was in release everyone was calling it an instant classic, but now it seems everyone hates it. People, make up one opinion and stick with it. But I say this film is and always was terrible. The most horrid was of 194 minutes in my entire life. The story of the Titanic, first off, is not very interesting to watch for three odd hours. And the artificial love story does not help down this horse pill of a movie. The music is the only thing that I enjoyed, but even that wore out its welcome near the last hour of the film. Cameron should've sunk this film before it came out and robbed people of 1.8 billion hard-earned dollars. I'm sorry to myself for seeing this film because everyone else was, and I'm sorry to everyone else who saw this embracement for this reason. It is not the fan of film, just the fan of stupid dialogue and great big ships sinking with bad graphics and all. Now give the Phantom Menace a break, will ya, and say something about this shipwreck!.5/10 (I can't bring myself to give a movie the same rating I gave to the 1998 version of Psycho, otherwise, I would be most inclined to slap a goose egg on this one.)",1,5,13,17 December 2001
A Beautiful Mind," Beautiful in every sense of the word
","Everything--the direction, the cinematography, the music, and of course, the acting--everything in the movie is beautiful. Russell Crowe is brilliant as he always is. He has done what I never expected him to do--match his performance as Jeff Wigand in Mann's 'The Insider.' He gives so much to his role as John Nash that I forgot it was him. His appearance becomes increasingly disturbing as the film moves along. Ron Howard's direction is flawless. He has finally proved to the world that he is an amazing director and no list of the best contemporary directors is complete unless it bears his name. The brightest gem in this film is Jennifer Connelly. Her performance is so real that you can't help but feel her pain in coping with her schizophrenic husband. Her performance as Alicia is worth every supporting actress accolade in the books. Ed Harris gives his best performance ever in a supporting role as Nash's antagonist. He appearance is so subtle it is absolutely terrifying. James Horner's musical score is grade A even compared to his previous work on Titanic and Glory. Beautifully cast, magnificently photographed, reverently directed, and hauntingly executed. This best film of the year 2001 is Ron Howard's magnum opus. A complete triumph that stands high above a rabble of mediocre works. Beautiful.

The Deer Hunter," Gripping
",The Deer Hunter is one of the most compelling and dramatic pictures I've ever seen. How it truthfully depicts how the effects of war can change the lives of normal people completely and forever is amazing. The russian roulette scenes are the hardest to watch. Christopher Walken delivers a dynamite performance that more than warranted him the Oscar. This is a great film. (9.9 out of 10),10,0,0,28 August 2000
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The Greatest Movie Ever Made!
","Without a doubt, myself and probably 80% of all other Americans would agree, this is one of (if not the) best films ever created. I mean, you can never get bored of this. The sound, the special effects, the cinematography, everything builds up an extraordinary movie experience of a lifetime!10 points out of 10",10,0,0,13 February 1999
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Revolutionary
","In 1977, Star Wars changed the world and ushered in a new age filled with imagination and dreams that transported audiences worldwide to an extraordinary place full of extraordinary experiences. This film is, and will always be, one of the most influential films ever created and will surely be praised for generations to come.",10,0,0,12 March 2000
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Who says the sequel is never as good as the original?
","The Empire Strikes Back is one of the films that breaks the rule about sequels. This film is just as good as Star Wars, and many people think it is better. I think Yoda is the key to the success of this film. You gotta love him. This film has more action in it as well as more humor. An absolute triumph. 10 points out of 10",10,0,0,14 March 1999
