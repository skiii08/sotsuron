"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," One of my all time favorites
","This movie is a must see for anyone who loves rollicking good time. The crazy adventures of two drag queens and a transsexual as the traverse Australia in a converted bus is hilarious. The music is nearly all ABBA and the costumes are simply over the top and deserving of the Oscar that they won - and who remembers the costume designer in her American Express Gold Card dress? This is a touching movie about self acceptance and true love despite all the odds. And all three of the main characters are straight but completely believable as gay men. The scene that contains the ping pong balls is, alone, worth the price of a rental but the film in its entirety is a fun-filled road show with a new twist.",Null,4,8,19 May 2006
