Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," It is perfect!
","Firstly I started to watch this film but I did not watch it. I was bored. Then, my body said that you must watch Sherlock Holmes and it is great movie. So, I started to watch again.When the film was ended, I was shocked. The film exceeded my expectations.Afterwards I watch Sherlock Holmes 1.And I understood that Sherlock Holmes every times is famous thanks to his intelligence not his fighting ability. From the beginning to end, there were excellent acting. Especially, the last part of this movie was perfect. The scenarist produces wonders.Every detail is thought that this film is based on details. It has not got a lot of action. I laughed most of scenes. I will suggest to my friends every time. And I added to it the first five of my top 25 lists. I will watch it again and again .It was great! You should watch it certainly if you do not watch.",Null,0,1,30 May 2012
Drag Me to Hell," let down !
","I watch this film with a few friends. The room was practically empty. So, it added to the films ambiance. Firstly I started to watch a horror film. But I see, it is not horror film. And I gave another chance. I continued watching as a horror comedy . Yes, this movie was not scary. It was far more funny than scary . . I have never laughed so hard at any horror movie in my life. Drag Me To Hell is the most sensible of the bunch. The film is centered around Christine Brown. The film is keenly self-aware. . It was a totally cheesy movie..It was watchable as a one-off, but I wouldn't watch it again.. The characters are flat and unrealistic . Most of the plot twists are familiar in concept to any fan of ghost movies. Some of the finer technical points clearly remain to be tweaked (sound, visual effects). it was such a big let down! . This movie was completely predictable, often resorting to extreme loud noise in a desperate bid to elicit some sort of scare from the audience that will instead leave you constantly adjusting your volume. And the ending is disgustingly predictable!!!!!",3,7,15,26 December 2011
50_50," great movie
","Great movie!In short, Adam is only twenty-seven. He has a good job, and a girlfriend. Actually, he has got everything in his life. However, suddenly he's diagnosed with cancer and everything changes in his life. This film was emotional, funny and thought-provoking. Discussing cancer is always so frightening to so many people. I love every time this kind of films which is suitable for real life.While I was watching this film, I was affected deeply. Desperation did not do such funny. Although, he is sick in his life's the best years - meaning of life, the question of why I am- he makes everything which he did not do till now.It is one of the best movies which I watched nowadays. Most of casts was excellent. Especially, Joseph Gordon Levitt's performance was wonderful. This film gives a message us. It is that 'laughter really is the best medicine'.It is one of the best films of the year so far .I think, if you do not watch fifty fifty, you should watch it tomorrow.",Null,0,0,30 May 2012
