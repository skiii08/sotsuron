50 First Dates," It's a matter of expectation.
","I have been reading all the viewer feedback and something strikes me about whether or not you will like this movie. Expectation.I am willing to bet that almost everyone who goes to see this movie, will be expecting Big Daddy, Billy Madison or other trademark Sandler comedic moments. Add to the mix Drew Barrymore and the more discerning viewer in possession of the temporal lobe will call to mind The Wedding Singer.On that premise, they go to see the movie and are sorely disappointed. People aren't evaluating the movie on what they see and how they feel when they leave the cinema, they are comparing the movie to their expectations and that is a huge mistake.So what did I think? Personally I loved it. I think it was one of the best movies of it's genre that I have seen in quite some time. Everyone has commented that it is 'Memento meets Groundhog Day' and so on, but I see past that. I see a metaphor.Think about it. In today's society, everyday we get up, go about our day, go about our lives in the same old way. It's no wonder so many marriages end in divorce. What this film provide a context. If we don't make an effort with our relationships, our partners start to forget the good things and the relationship ends. In Sandler and Barrymore's case, it's just a much quicker process.I admire the movie because to me it sends a message that every relationship should be this way and we should all treat our lovers this way. Even if they don't have a brain disorder.What I loved about this movie seems to be what other people hated about it. That Sandler, while still doing what he does best, has toned down his trademark crudeness and proven that he can play a serious role. That Barrymore was as cute and fresh and I think one reviewer described her as 'flower-girl.' Personally, I have long been a fan of Drew Barrymore and while I hated the Charlie's Angel's sequel, I think that she is a serious actress and people aren't always willing to look at that.Last week in Australia we were fortunate enough to have Drew Barrymore interviewed by our own Rove McManus and prior to seeing the film I was thrilled to hear Barrymore's thoughts. They echo my own. That the movie is powerful because of the inevitable futility.Something I have since realised is that accepting the challenge of making someone fall in love with you every day, is a proclamation of love in it's own right. The same thing that helped Sandler win over the father and brother in the film (God, Astin cracked me up!) is the same lesson I think alot of people need to learn.I think (and I know people will hate this) is that people who don't like this film can be sorted into several categories.1. People who can't be bothered to/or are afraid of showing extreme signs of love to someone2. People that are functioning on 5 brain cells and just spent ten dollars to watch Sandler chase a penguin, chase someone with a golf club, or chase his ever escaping childhood. (Don't get me wrong, I loved all of those movies, but if Sandler can grow as an actor, why can't we grow as viewers?)3. Bitter and twisted people who have been hurt to the point of never trusting again.I think what also confuses people with this film is that while they compare to Memento and Groundhog Day, it doesn't fall into an immediate formula. Let's try it. Boy meets Girl. Boy likes Girl. Girl likes Boy. Girl forgets Boy. Wow it's easy when you try, isn't it?Make no mistake, it is worth watching, but clear your mind before you do.",Null,0,0,2 April 2004
Romeo + Juliet," *sigh* The futility of it all.
","I recently re-read one of my favorite books, '48 Shades of Brown' by Nick Earls. One of his characters, Dan is reviewing R+J for a school assignment and writes a piece, which let's face it, Nick wrote, about how the first time Romeo and Juliet see each other is through the fish tank and while captivated with each other they cannot touch. A metaphor of how things stand? That they can't be together? maybe.Brilliant cinematography and direction turned this film into a fantastic experience. Leonardo was better than I have seen him, and being honest I am not a huge fan of his. Claire Danes on the other hand ... sigh. If only. I absolutely love this girl. She brought so many new levels to Juliet that I can completely understand Romeo's obsession with her. Ahhh ... happy thoughts. There we go.The one thing I really can say is that if this film encourages kids to read Shakespeare (which I am also hoping 'Ten Things I Hate About You' does) then that is a good good thing. After all, my girlfriend at the time of watching R+J was sad and sadly surprised that Leo and Claire offed themselves in the end.Is this the society we live in?I look forward to your feedback, please feel free to email me and discuss this film or others.",Null,0,1,11 June 2004
Van Helsing," Kate Beckinsale and Vampires or Buffy the Vampire Slayer meets Indiana Jones
","My summary title actually includes three of my favorite things in the world. Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Indiana Jones movies and Kate Beckinsale. Not necessarily in that order. As I sit here pondering my review I am mentally re-writing the Sound of Music to include:'Sarah Michelle Geller and Kate Beckinsale' 'Vampires being chased and later impaled' 'Harrison Ford action film offerings' 'These are a few of my favorite things'But, as usual I digress. I have to wonder about Kate at the moment as between Van Helsing and Underworld she is really exploring the Draculan stuff at the moment. But she did Van Helsing sooooooooo well!This movie was great. A lot of detractors are walking around saying things like: predictable, formula, stunts were unbelievable (no! really? and vampires and werewolves are?) but on the whole I liked it. it served it's purpose which was to keep me entertained.I walked into the cinema. Took a seat. Gulped on my large 1/4 fanta, 3/4 coke concoction that the cinema staff 'just love' making for me, and lost myself in fantasy until the end credits rolled. Hugh Jackman is always good... I think he is brilliant, but it was the offsider who stole the show in this case. Go Carl. You can doooo eeeeet!Great effects. Solid camera work. Kate Beckinsale which equals the good. Two thumbs up. Feel free to email me with your comments.",Null,1,2,11 June 2004
