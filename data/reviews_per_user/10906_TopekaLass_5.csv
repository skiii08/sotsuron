Moneyball," One of the better behind the scenes movies
","Baseball, baseball, baseball. I thought that maybe I did not want to see another baseball film. After all, hasn't it all been said and done? Well, maybe not like 'MONEYBALL', which is more about what is going on behind the scenes. Well... yes. The movie focuses on how talent and teams are made circa 2002.Brad Pitt plays 'Billy Beane', the general manager of the Oakland Athletics. bean enlists the aide of his assistant, Peter Brand, and with statistical analysis known as saber-metrics, that places the emphasis on stats such Beane assembles a group of players. A colorful group.Bennet Miller directs very well with performances and pacing in mind.Steven Zaillian's and Aaron Sorkin's script and the story by Stan Chervin based on the book by Michael Lewis, gives us a moving and fast paced movie without the benefit of a lot of ball playing.Great performances by Brad Pitt, Jonah Hill, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Robin Wright and Chris Pratt.I recommend",8,0,1,23 February 2012
21 Jump Street," A fun script
","So a guy named Schmidt, played by Jonah Hill, and a guy named Jenk, played by Channing Tatum enlist in the police force's Jump Street unit. There they are able to utilize their youthful appearances to go undercover at a local high school. They soon discover that high school isn't like it was just a few years ago. OR maybe it is.Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum do a fine job of bringing out their own youthfulness in 21 Jump Street, which very much helps the fun script. Two directors are credited with this movie - Phil Lord, Chris Miller, so I'm not sure what that is all about. But given those circumstances the movie survived. 21 Jump Street probably stands to make a lot of money in the long run as it is one of those movies where you just want to not have to think to hard.",8,0,2,29 March 2012
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Fincher creates a nice dark atmosphere
","This version of Girl With The Dragon Tattoo (the original released in 2009) adopts its own look and feel. The actors bring different variations to their roles and didn't copy what the original cast had done. This was no easy task and they pulled it off. The same could be said for David Fincher as the director of this recent version. He took the original and made it his own. Fincher is really good at this stuff. He did a great job of giving the look a dark, cloudy foreboding feeling, thanks to the phenomenal photography of Jeff Cronenweth.It seemed like he brought in the Zodiac style, and that's a good thing. The music is by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross constant and foreboding and blend very well with the style and pacing.Daniel Craig, Rooney Mara and the rest of the cast were all well underplayed. A special nod to actor, Christopher Plummer, who seems to keep your eyes on him in every scene that he is in.",8,1,5,9 February 2012
The Hurt Locker," Excellent
","The Hurt Locker was surprisingly good. I thought it was going to be another war movie, but it was more about humans and their characters.Director Kathryn Bigelow scores big with this movie. Tightly written by Mark Boal, the story centers around soldiers doing the ultra-dangerous job of disarming bombs during combat operations. A new commander (a sergeant) is foolish in his approach, as though he couldn't care less about dying. So he puts his team in danger as well. There is a push and pull to keep this new commander from getting everyone killed, while the city falls into chaos with deadly hostility everywhere. The suspense is strong and the ending is surprising.This is one of those 'war' movies that doesn't really take a political stand, but focuses on human interaction. Bigelow handles the action and her actors extremely well. The whole cast, including those playing minor characters, gives honest performances. Good to see actors depicting characters in such situations with subtlety.",8,1,7,7 January 2010
The Artist," Yeah, it received Academy acclaim!
","In Hollywood's silent movie era of the 1920s, a movie star realizes that pictures where the actors can talk will destroy his career. Then he meets a dancer and the plot thickens!Writer and director: Michel Hazanavicius creates an absolutely entertaining, and early era romantic atmosphere with The Artist. The movie's lead actor, Jean Dujardin, is not only sympathetic to watch (no easy task without the benefit of a speaking role), but also gives a very fine performance. I loved the music in this movie. I'm not sure if I will have the same experience, but the music kind of makes me want to see other silent movies that actually came from that era!Prior to the Academy awards, I had seen about three interviews with Harvey Weinstein. It seems that, if not for his actions, The Artist would never have been so widely released and would never have made it to the awards show. I feel that there should have been more shout outs to him, each time The Artist received an award.But, having said that, I still enjoyed the movie very much.",7,2,4,27 February 2012
