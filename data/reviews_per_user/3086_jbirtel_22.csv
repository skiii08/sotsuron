Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Opportunity Lost!!
","Depending on which day of the week it is, I can't decide which is worse. 'Phantom...' or 'Attack...'I figured that 'Phantom...' would prime me for Episode II. Now that both are on dvd, it's not gelling together as nicely as it should. And not many people are buying the 'it's meant for 12 year olds' approach. Even 12 year olds can have their intelligence insulted.One more to go! I'm in no hurry to see it...but I will see it.And how many times did he watch 'Ben-Hur' just before writing this??Too bad Lucas didn't sell barf bags at 10 cents apiece during Episode II's love scenes. That alone would have netted him an extra billion dollars.6 out of 10",6,0,1,26 November 2002
Casablanca," Time Hasn't Gone By This Classic!
","I saw this movie in college 20 years ago with over seventy 18-23 year old fellow students. And the audience reaction was like the movie just came out yesterday. Here's a movie that assumes that the average audience has intelligence. And the tons of laughs were all in the right places for the right reasons. Twenty years later, I can still hear the laughter and applause...and the cheers; especially for that now classic closing line.If more black and white classics were given this kind of DVD treatment (the recent 2 disc release), then I'd own more black and white classics. Bogart's brilliant portrayal was ahead of its time and no one else but Bergman could of been Elsa. Same for Rains, Henreid, Sakall, Veidt and EVERYONE else. Perfect cast, perfect acting.It's a shame most people will never see this with an audience because this is a crowd pleaser if ever there was one. So the next best thing is the quality and care that was put into the new DVD. Believe it or not, this makes a great 'at home' date flick. And even have a few friends over...but not the 'chatty' ones. There's just too much to miss if so and so starts to 'yackitty! yackitty! yackitty! during the many (& there are many) priceless and subtle moments. This movie deserves full attention. And the nice thing is...you pick up more the 2nd time seeing it (& 3rd, 4th...etc).My favorite line (no way am I repeating it or any others) is Rick's 'poor salesmanship' rejection. This one film has more great 'one liners' than some hundred movies put together. And it still seems as fresh today as when...well; when I saw it the 1st time.It's not that 'they don't make em like this anymore' applies to 'Casablanca' because most movies, for every year, in every era (since the 1920's); aren't very good. It's always the very few that rise above the heap, every year; especially when you take into account that over 100 movies are made every year. But 'Casablanca' represents a sample of damn fine storytelling for that particular era that time has proved to be...timeless.A 'must see' for most movie lovers (but not the 'yackitty' ones).10 out of 10!(Can't wait for Bogart's 'Treasure of the Sierra Madre's 2 disc DVD release next month. Another sample of just how brilliant Bogart's acting is.)",10,4,5,18 August 2003
Dawn of the Dead," Ferocious Beginning; Downhill From There!
","Why remake a good movie? (Oh! the money...duh!) Personally, I'd like to see more movies that WEREN'T done right the first time get remade.My expectations were a little low. Then the movie starts!...and Hey! there's hope after all. A creepy beginning that gets sca-aarr-rry! OK! I can live with 'super-zombies' if this quality is maintained. Unfortunately, the opening is the best part.For any film to succeed ya gotta have something called characterization. And except for Sarah Polley and (the always reliable) Ving Rames; everyone else is snoresville. There's just too many characters filling up space and not enough quality writing to justify their being there. Where's the acting? The shock or panic? They seem to be just running thru their lines as if they can't wait for 'lunch is here' to be announced. Even in horror movies, a certain logic has to prevail to make the surrounding apocalypse feel believable. This has holes large enough for a fleet of semis. It feels like everyone was so impressed with themselves that they were somehow part of horror history with their involvement with a 'Romero Dead Remake' that the logical details were forsaken for shock sake. And this list of plot holes are too long to take up time to start listing.Conclusion: Stick with the original and rent for curiosity sake. Not without merit, but it just didn't work for me...I'd rather watch a scary movie the scares!",Null,3,6,26 October 2004
Dawn of the Dead," A Retraction!
","Maybe my last review was a tad hasty.I had previously posted an earlier (harsher) comment based on the theatrical release the day before the DVD's U.S. debut. Should have waited just a couple more days.After viewing the 'Unrated Director's Edition' with my wife and son (neither had seen it), it came down to this: This was much, much more enjoyable the 2nd time round. Just because this didn't scare me, doesn't mean that this movie isn't scary. I had just as much fun (maybe I'm sick!) watching out of the corner of my eye, my wife and son 'yip', jump and cringe behind their couch pillows during the shocking scenes; as much as I did re-watching the flick itself. Or maybe cuz it was late Saturday night; the night before Halloween! Dying (no pun intended) for something to watch that would be kinda scary (at least for them). Something scary on a global crisis level! And guess what? For them...the scares delivered; Yep-per-ree!!...them scares delivered Big Time!The 'Unrated...' clears up a few more plot holes (like ahh! how they got into the mall by breaking a store window without being followed??) and establishes a little more character opportunities. It did seem better acted the 2nd time around. Fact is, it was just some 'actor spottiness' by a couple of the supporting players that colored my original perceptions. And if Jake Weber doesn't get more acting jobs after this, he needs to fire his agent. The guy's got great voice inflection!On a hunch, I bought the 'Unrated'...dvd during it's 1st week, while still on sale discount. Because I very much wanted to like this movie, in spite of how disappointing it seemed the 1st time seeing it. Besides, it was Halloween weekend. You know everyone enjoys a good, scary Halloween fright flick during Halloween time...Right?? Hey; doesn't most everybody??? Well...good decision!Is it as good or better than the original? Not quite!...but that's an opinion. A few too many scenes where thrills take precedent over logic (try exploding a propane tank so close to a fueled powered bus). There's no denying that many vintages surpass the original. And some nice departures on its own. A 1st time director??...there's worse out there from seasoned veterans.(Secret for uping the scare scale!: Ya just gotta know when to discreetly crank up the volume during the shocking, graphic moments...it helps.)",Null,1,2,26 November 2004
Shaun of the Dead," What A Pleasant Surprise!
","I spotted 'Shaun...' in the upcoming releases of IMDb and dismissed it for several weeks because of its lackluster (ok! I get it) title. Only after curiosity compelled me to click on some film critic reviews was I wowed by the response. Any zombie flick that results in so much positive feedback has to be worth a look.And after looking, the good news is: that in spite of an (almost) slow beginning; and a laughless 15 minutes toward the end (but not THE END; which, in retrospect, could not (and) should not end ANY other way...it is FUU-UN-NY and Fitting); this has more belly laughs than any movie I've seen in years. It's sharp, clever and still manages to respectfully retain the horror element (if not so much the scary element). At no time during the movie did I slap my knees while cursing under my breath for the on screen characters to 'run faster' or 'get out of there quicker'; instead I was reduced to a glob of jello with laughter BECAUSE the characters weren't 'running faster' or 'getting out of there quicker' (especially in the slow buildup scene that displays the dangers of 'child resistance car locks'). Not without flaws; there seemed to be too many times when flocks of zombies just stood there waiting (for what??) before the director gave the go-ahead to jump start their lunge toward their victims. But for comedy's sake, sometimes you don't mind.Romero's original 'DEAD' trilogy is THE thrilling fun and THE creme-de-la-creme in zombie horror. Why? oh why? did it take so long for another zombie movie, that's mostly a comedy, to FINALLY get it right, with characters that ARE right, for this genreAnd Shaun and Ed make a wonderful comedy team with great on screen chemistry. That alone was worth the price of admission.Now, the faster 'Shaun of the Dead' dies a quick death in America (no pun intended), the faster it can rise from the undead and into the realm of DVD. Sorry if it sounds selfish...but 'what the hell', I've already made room for it in my DVD library. So let's release it already! After all... the Brits got it. And there's still too many great movies made in Queenland that don't receive their due recognition in the states (so what else is new?).As tempting as it is, no way, NO WAY am I spoiling anything of what happens. Too many reviews already gave away some very choice moments. For some reason, even knowing some of them did not ruin the belly laughs. I laughed just as hard anyway.",Null,0,1,29 September 2004
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Looks Great! Sounds Awful! (and we ain't talking about the brilliant sound effects)
","First off, George Lucas is an elite for having so much influence on the art of movies; and why we go to them. He's put his hard earned millions back into improving the art form, so story tellers can better realize their vision on film (& digital). He constantly pushes the envelope to take the medium into new and wonderful directions. And he has vision!His 'THX' and 'Industrial Light and Magic' companies have elevated films to a brilliant quality thought unreachable. He is unquestionably a movie maker. But recently, he's fallen far short as movie director. And as for writing dialogue...it's spotty at best (even with help).And that is the problem with 'Attack of the Clones'. I so very much wanted to like this movie alot more than I did. And I do like alot of it. It has many, many grand moments. But the problem stems from the fact that Lucas, simply put, is wearing too many hats. By itself, directing is a huge undertaking. So is producing! And so is writing! And how many different companies does he head?? With so many talented directors and dialogue writers...it's not like he didn't have the money to invest in them. It would have been better if he had 'kicked himself upstairs to executive producing'(again), bit the bullet and allowed some talented people who know their jobs to step in to help bring his vision to life.Ya git what ya pay for! And because he took on so many duties himself, he didn't have to pay out the extra money (or points). So his talent is spread pretty thin.Where did the money go toward? The fantastic special effects and the digital domain. The movie looks...stunning!!! The visuals are like a work of art AND a work of genius. Great color spectrum! The sets are wildly imaginative with little dashes of familiar cultures sprinkled through out. 'Star Wars' has always been synonymous with 'eye candy' and 'Attack...' is no exception.But it's hard not to cringe at some of the dialogue that even insults the intelligence of a 12 year old (my 10 year old picked that up on his own). If money was the issue; then Lucas should of sold barf bags during the Ani/Padme love scenes at 10 cents each. That alone would have netted him a billion dollars.Three years ago, I assumed Lucas' administration duties made him a tad rusty for directing (& writing) 'The Phantom Menace'. And that things would improve with the next chapter (and there was alot I liked about '...Menace', and alot I didn't). But the warning bells began to sound during a theatrical preview for '...Clones' in December of 2001 when Padme recited that god-awful line, 'Ani??? My Goodness! You've grown!!'. Uh-oh! Here we go again!'Empire Strikes Back' remains in my top 10 faves! It's a landmark film because: it improves upon the original (arguably); has better special effects than the original; and dares to end in a cliffhanger. Most importantly: the acting; the direction; and the dialogue is more mature and more natural. The actors are also more natural delivering their lines with a more leisurely pace. It bridges that difficult gap of giving equal entertainment to both children and adults. Screen writer Leigh Bracket (for 'Empire...') whose credits include 1946's 'The Big Sleep', is a far cry from choosing a screen writer who wrote 'The Scorpion King??'. The difference in quality is obvious.(A hypothetical example: In 'Empire Strikes Back', Han and Leia are escaping from the ice planet Hoth during the Empire's assault on the planet surface. As 3PO lags behind, Han yells, 'Hurry up, Goldenrod! or you're gonna be a permanent resident.' That line, in the new films are on the quality of, 'Come-on, 3PO! Run faster or they're gonna catch us.' See the difference?)'AOTC' actors have already proven their talent in other movies. But when actors are forced to spout kindergarten dialogue, get substandard direction AND work off a blue screen: it's just too big a challenge that's gonna result in getting them unfairly lamblasted by fans and critics alike. Audiences don't need characters to spoon feed them dialogue that tells them what's going on, while the audience can already SEE what the screen is already SHOWING them what is going on. Too bad the film makers didn't realize that 'audience intelligence' and 'film language subtlety' make a wonderful marriage.And Lucas can be a good director...he proved that with 'American Graffiti' (another movie that broke the rules...successfully). But he's just wearing too many hats of responsibility.AND JUST FOR FUN! What's with that name Count 'DooKu'?? Sounds like a messy case of dog diarrhea left steaming on someone's carpet.Or Yoda's quick wit when he tells Dooku (that name again), 'I sense the dark side in you'. OH REALLY??? Let's give Yoda a gold medal as 'Champion of the Obvious'.And how we're supposed to believe Padme is a great politician, when it seems her biggest contribution to the Republic is breaking the record for the most wardrobe changes in one hour.And speaking of her wardrobe...ain't she 'The Tease'!!! while wagging her finger 'No! No!' at Ani's advances.And speaking of Annie!!! (I know it's spelled Ani...but still). Is anyone else uncomfortable that there's gonna be an 'Annie' under Vader's helmet??? Why not 'Gertrude'??? Or 'Patty'!!!The direction the prequels are heading for is turning A New Hope for episode 3, into A No Hope!I, along with millions of movie lovers, am forever grateful for Lucas in providing hundreds of hours of repeat entertainment he has created with the Star Wars universe. This has NEVER been a story of the future (even though it's so often erroneously referred to as a story that takes place in the future). His mythology will continue to entertain generations for a long time to come.As the logo for 'THX' says, 'The Audience Is Listening'. Besides movie magic special effects...the audience listens to dialogue too, something the film makers forgot.The DVD does sound phenomonal! And I'm happy to own it (for the kids sake, of course).For Episode 3...if I hear that line one more time: 'I have a bad feeling about this!', I may start looking around to make sure I know where the exit signs are.But I still feel indebted for 'Star Wars' for giving sights & sounds never heard before. And love that homage to Ray Harryhausen!",6,1,2,31 March 2003
The Godfather: Part II," Bold Approach! An Abbreviated Classic!
","Seeing this at the theater in 74' was beyond everyone's expectations. It's intelligent, beautifully shot and a perfect 'bookend' to the original. Now here comes a problem that turns into a major compliment!Many viewers (like myself) are spoiled with the recent broadcasts of the 'Godfather Saga' (originally shown in 1977) on various cable channels that incorporates about 54 minutes of deleted footage and places the 'Godfather 1 & 2 story in chronological order. As excellent as PART II is, I'd prefer an uncensored version of the saga. The reason: there many more scenes lifted from the book and the characters are further explored. The irony of the rise and fall of the Corleone Family would still have an impact after 7 hrs 15 min's. Long...but very rewarding.Still PART II gets a 10! But now it feels 'edited'.",10,0,1,16 October 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A Visual (& audio) Feast!
","First...A disclaimer! (and trivia; for those who care) Lord of the Rings is NOT a trilogy, despite popular perception. It ranks as one of the longest single novel that's been written and consists of 6 books:BOOK I  'The First Journey' and BOOK II 'The Journey of the Nine Companions' comprise FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING. BOOK III  'The Treason of Isengard' and BOOK IV 'The Journey of the Ringbearers' are THE TWO TOWERS. BOOK V  'The War of the Ring' and BOOK VI 'The End of the Third Age' concludes THE RETURN OF THE KING.(the titles were part of Tolkien's manuscript but were never used).That said, the upcoming TWO TOWERS & RETURN...are not sequels and shouldn't be viewed as such. So There !!!  Like Peter Jackson, I can't wait till the entire trilo...oops, I mean the entire story can be viewed back to back on DVD at 10 hours plus.Oh! the movie. It's great! On 1st viewing, there were more things I liked then didn't, but my perception was prejudiced from my own interpretation cemented thru many years (I read it 8 or 9 times over 20 years). But on repeated viewings, I came to appreciate the brilliance behind the maker's decisions on how to tackle the telling that would appeal to readers and non-readers alike (face it! there's no way to please EVERYBODY). Compromises were necessary; so it wasn't to the letter of the book. What was captured faithfully were the set-pieces, the characters (fleshed out beyond expectation) and the spirit of the excitement & thrills. This is what cinema should be.Those who liked the movie (readers and non) will appreciate a repeat viewing that is near improbable to catch the first time. SUBTLE SPOILER:(that's Gollum's voice screaming 'Shire' then 'Baggins', seconds later the Nine Riders exit the gates of  Barad-dur [the Dark Lord's tower]. Immediately what follows is Gandalf's approach toward Minas Tirith [nice long shot] that will be more prevalent as the city besieged in RETURN OF THE KING. And of course, readers will recognize Tom, Bert and Bill, the trolls from 'The Hobbit'. This is just a few bits of treasure laced thru-out the movie). (more subtle spoilers) I admired the slight changes made. I never did believe Frodo could've stayed on that horse by himself, in his condition, on his final flight from the Nine Riders (unless the horse sprouted an extra pair of hands to hold him) so Arwen's expanded role seemed totally justified. It also gave the filmaker's an opportunity to expand the role of women as heroes, that was sadly minimized in the trilo...darn-it!...I mean the epic (I almost take that back as the character 'Eowyn' will prove in the upcoming sequ... I mean, installments of the story). Also, the Tom Bombadil episode was an amusing trifle...for the novel (I did like it), but I always wondered how anyone could film that section without producing unintentional laughter from the audience. It's ommission is ok by me, as the first part of the movie really belongs to the thrill of the chase and the terror of capture from the Nine.There are so many nice things said about the performances, the music, the locales, the props (wonderful) that's been said better then I can (most of all...Jackson and the collaborater's vision) so, no sense in repeating it here. It's not totally flawless...but realistically...what is?? As far as it's slight from the American Academy Awards as Best Picture...big deal! (It did win the British Award and American Film Inst. Award) No lack of any award robbed my enjoyment from Citizen Kane, Chinatown, Wizard of Oz (I equally loved the movies that did win_) and the lack of Best Picture won't take any pleasure away from Fellowship.. (please don't interpret that I'm lumping these movies on the same level - I'm just making a point - then again, maybe I am)For those who didn't enjoy it as much, that's understandable. No movie in history has been unanimous amoung critics, or viewers for that matter. I wasn't sure how much I enjoyed it the first time, but after many repeat viewings, I surrender!   10 out of 10",10,4,4,3 June 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Extended Version Works Better! Especially in DTS Sound!
","Whatever rating anyone gives to 'Fellowship...', will have to give the same rating to the next two installments (notice I didn't say sequels). To do differently is the same as picking ANY other movie ever done; dividing it in three equal sections, then rating each section differently. Can anyone imagine taking a film like 'Jaws' and reviewing the 1st 40 minutes, then have a 2nd rating for the next 40 minutes, then doing the same for the last 40 minutes?'Lord of the Rings' is ONE story! Filmed simultaneously, out of order (like 95% of all other films), many scenes from 'Two Towers' & 'Return of the King' were completed before 'Fellowship...'; but who is gonna sit in a theater for 10 1/2 hours straight? (yes, the extended versions will total 10 1/2 hours plus). The beauty is that because of the length, Jackson has the privilege of doing pick-up shots and re-shoots for the rest of the film. No other studio in history ever had the guts to commit that kind of money and time. Three years prep; $300 million.And no one can stop the juggernaut of popularity and staple in movie history that this film has created. The theatrical version's Shire intro, thru Frodo and Gandalf's perception, was exceptional. The extended version Shire sequence is a welcome 'alternate universe'. Now anyone can debate to their heart's content which is better. The rest of the added scenes makes the film less episodic and improves the dramatic pacing.So much care and quality attention to detail has gone into this mammoth undertaking. Every one involved deserves the highest praise for their labor of love. Which is a lesson that history keeps repeating: some of the best movies made, are those that are furthest away from Hollywood...and Hollywood interference. True films are not made by fancy suits sitting around the board room. Nor is a film polished thru 1 or 2 negative review cards from sneak previews. New Line deserves credit for entrusting the film makers to work their cinema magic and allowing the film makers to be...film makers!'Two Towers'??? Hell; that will only whet my appetite for X-mas 2003. Better still...November 2003! Because by then, the film (notice I didn't say 'films') will be available in its extended 10 1/2 hour form.For now, so far...10+ out of...10+. I'm certain to apply the same rating for the next 2. The quality is already there.And that DTS sound! Also, there's an easter egg containing the 'Two Towers' preview & an MTV parody but I'll be damned if I can find it. Help!!!",10,1,1,26 November 2002
Spider-Man," A Well Done Bubble Gum Approach!
","Comics are made for the kids. It's the kids that read them over and over; get obsessed; get lost in pure escapism.It's the movie that bridges the gap between the kids and the adults (that have a little bit of the kid in them). And that's all this movie tries to be. An homage, made by a 'comic fan movie director' that covers so much in so little time, the same way that one frame on a comic page has to show & tell so much in so little time. It's nostalgic, warm and respectful to the Spider-Man legacy. To ask for more...well...we won't go there.I enjoyed this at the theater as much as my 10 year old (and the rest of the audience). Director Rami thankfully avoided the pitfall of misinterpreting the costumes into a 'why can't we see more mobility in the masks' approach. That's the real challenge! A less talented director would have opted for the obvious 'let's improve the masks' mentality, while ignoring the human story that made the original comic endure for so many years. This movie adaptation stays true to the spirit of Stan Lee's creation.Well cast, great music, great sets (& colors) and a contemporary view on a 40 year comic legacy that's fast and fresh. And love that 'Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man' music lifted from the old Saturday morning cartoon at the close of the end credits.8.5 out of 10!  One word...Fun!",Null,0,0,19 March 2003
Gone with the Wind," Still A Milestone Entertainment!!
","Back in 76' (geeessh, that long ago?), this movie played to a packed theater in college (showtime @ 7pm & an intermission)...and ranked as one of my best movie going experiences. 80% of the audience was (probably) between 18-22, and this audience rocked. They cheered at the opening titles; they cheered at each of the 4 main character's intro scene; the 'scandalous' waltz; Melanie & Ashley's (cliched)reunion; Gable's return after a lengthy hiatus; Scarlett's smitten 'morning after' reaction to Rhett's drunken seduction (an especially loud cheer as Leigh awakens, then stretches and purrs with guilty satisfaction; it's hysterical!!), Rhett's exit line; and on and on...and on. The audience's reaction was contagious and their (my) attitude toward the film was treated with equal camp and respect. Ya just don't get that much fun at the movies with regular movie goers at regular theaters (unfortunately). 25 years later when the movie was restored and rereleased at the theaters (98 or 99), it played at some colleges and the reaction was...the same. Now that's a testament to the durable and indestructible power that this film will always have. (Note: this experience was in upstate New York, not down south)There's no allusions to the fact that this is a self-centered southern (and very outdated...sometime insulting) fantasy soap opera. Scarlett is mostly a despicable character that has strength fueled by her selfish ambitions. So is Rhett! (but at least with half a heart). The fact that we still care about the characters is the real power of this film as our emotions are jerked between rooting for them and despising their actions at the same time. What this film reveals the most is...the viewer!!! If the viewer defends Scarlett's actions, is repulsed by her antics, or tries to maintain some clarity of the type of person Scarlett really is...that, in itself, can be as revealing about just what type of person the viewer is as about the characters themselves.This movie has color! It has scope! It has a big story to tell in its (short) 4 hour running time. The direction is tight, it moves quick. There's no time for an actor's ego of 'hey, let the camera linger and linger...and linger on ME to show the world what a great talent I (think I) have'. Especially nowadays when so many performances are obsessed with (hollow) Oscar ambitions. This is a film where the story comes and is served first...the way a film's story should be.All the actors (it seems) were born to play these roles. They come off with conviction (if not in reality). But, then again, this isn't a reality movie. It just wants to tell its story and move the story along in the same spirit as the story is told in the book. You don't have to agree with its philosophies or its perceptions to deprive yourself of its entertainment. And 65 years later, entertains it does!And contrary to popular belief: Vivien Leigh was chosen by David O. Selznick as early as 37' (revealed by his many memos). His masterminded scheme of conducting a bogus 'free publicity' casting search for Scarlett was brilliant! After all these years, many people are gullible enough to still believe he started filming the 'burning of Atlanta' scene without securing the star of a massive, expensive 4 hour flick. But as one of director John Ford's movie character once said; 'When the legend becomes fact...print the legend'. Still a 10!",10,2,4,27 August 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," 'LORD OF THE RINGS' PART 2!
","Like it or not, 'Lord Of The Rings' is ONE movie. It's the precedent of a very brave commitment made by a single studio to tell an epic story...on the grand scale that it deserves. To say that one installment is better (or worse) than the other 2 installments, is the same as taking ANY movie; splitting it in 3 equal parts; then analyzing which section is better. Go Ahead! Try It! Pick Any Movie.Definitely...'The Two Towers' adaptation is getting more screen time. And I've enjoyed the artistic license that Jackson and Co took to let the story unfold and accelerate. Bookwise...'Two Towers' ain't over yet.All the actor/characters have fleshed out their counterparts beyond expectation (already proven in 'Fellowship...). Gollum's performance is deservedly unanimous (and loved those Ents too...hey it's a fantasy!) And glad to see the Wargs make their debut that featured in Tolkien's 'The Hobbit' and 'Fellowship of the Ring' (the 'Journey in the Dark' chapter); but were sorely missing up till now. Also loved how Jackson inserted Gandalf's battle with the Balrog.10 out of 10! (Same as the 1st one...can't wait till the last one)",10,0,0,24 February 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Extended Version: Who Says Bigger Ain't Better!
","Bigger story! Bigger sound! What a difference in DTS.What the extended versions have done (for me and probably millions of other viewers) is that the theatrical versions are now obsolete. It's a shame that for a long while to come, the majority will have only experienced the story via the shorter versions. Oh well! For the millions who have enjoyed the longer versions it's the same as being privy to being on the inside of a joke that the majority just didn't get. And repeated viewings only enriches it. But not too many...not yet! Not till 'RETURN's...' extended version becomes available so this film can be truly appreciated the way it's meant to be. Not for years have I gotten so much enjoyment out of one film (and I'm not talking about 'Two Towers'; I'm talking about 'Lord of the Rings'...one story...one film...on 6 DVD discs; not counting the additional 6 DVD bonus discs). The added scenes, some lifted from the novel, some not; adds depth to the story and to the characters. Am already counting the days to the extended 'RETURN...'.And love Gollum's MTV award's acceptance speech on the easter egg!",10,0,1,23 August 2004
2001: A Space Odyssey," A Milestone in Storytelling ! Often Misunderstood (& understandably so)!
","In 1968, a movie critic that had panned 2001 on its original release (and later retracted) wrote: 'Everyone hates 2001 except people'.The Odyssey demanded: 'To appreciate 2001, is to see it again. And again! '2001 defies conventional rules of any generic movie. Multi-layered enough to deceive its audience by zeroing its focus on the 'HAL' crisis. Subplot is presented as 'The Major Plot'! And 'The Major Plot' is demoted to Subplot. But it is that 'Major Plot' that ultimately fascinates. That; and the realistic hardware that is subjectively presented as if you, the viewer, were a passenger along for the ride. That is the core of the movie's mystical power that entices people to revisit over and over again.And because of its subplot, it's no accident that HAL steals the show.A question that asks 'What If...' What if human evolution was the outcome of extra terrestrial manipulation. A 'Part 1' and 'Part 2' story covering humankind's 2 stage evolutionary process.Part 1 is told in 16 minutes! Part 2 takes the 2 hour remainder.Because novel and film were simultaneously 4 years in the making (Arthur C Clark couldn't release the book until 2 months after the general release), Kubrick takes full artistic license to go full speed ahead in defiling any previous sci fi movie; any previous book adaptation; and reinvigorating the silent film format all at the same time.Plus the most intensive science/movie research on space travel technology ever conceived up to that point that, 36 years later, hasn't been outdated yet. Every detail, down to the low hum of air filtration, was incorporated.Using 'real time slices of life' sections of only a few chapters, Kubrick, at his command, displays his brilliant understanding of the film median. He stretches the bonds and bounds of film rules, breaks many along the way and creates some of his own.It is one of the most subjective and kinetic movies ever produced. It's a film that demands to be sensed, watched and listened to.And one of the few times where book & movie go hand in hand.In space, no one can hear...anything! As far as I know, Stanley is the only film maker who had the balls to use the dead silence of space to create the story's tension. '2001: A Space Odyssey' tantalizes us with food for thought; and in that tantalizing area, it doesn't disappoint.If you don't 'get it' the 1st time you see it; get in line. I saw it the 1st time in 71'. And I didn't fully appreciate it for 14 years and a few viewings later.A word about Alex North's original score. By itself, the score is awesome. If you start the CD when the MGM logo appears you can actually sync the music to what appears on screen for the 1st 6 or 7 minutes. It creates a flavor all its own. And that's why Kubrick was (unfortunately) justified in yanking it. By placing music over the 'Dawn of Man' sequence, it destroys the desolation and near extinction that early man/ape faced. And nothing could replace Kubrick's selection of existing music for Heywood Floyd's space journey. The main problem is SOMEONE should have told Alex that his music wasn't used before he attended the premiere.Perfect Acting! (contrary to a lot of reactions). People in the high risk, professional space program are trained to react with minimal emotion. To do otherwise, could mean the difference between life and death...even when death occurs. And the underrated William Sylvester does a brilliant bit of camouflage during his morale speech to the troops; and drops his 'nice guy' mask for 1 split second to reveal how ruthless he is for the sake of (so-called) security. If you literally blink, you miss it. He's got these people by the balls and there's nothing in their power they can do about it.Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood gave exceptional performances that made you believe they were astronauts actually aboard the Jupiter bound Spaceship Discovery When I purchase my wide screen projection and 8 ft screen, guess what movie is going on 1st?",10,1,4,11 September 2005
Reservoir Dogs," Funny, Bloody, 1st Rate Gangsterama (& little green bag)
","There is a deleted scene in 'Pulp Fiction' where Mia Wallace interviews Vincent Vega and says there are 2 types of people: Elvis people or Beatles people; you can like them both but no one likes them equally.In the same token, there seems to be similar groups who love 'Pulp...' and 'Reservoir...' (though some hate one or the other; or both) but few like them equally. As one of the 'Few' who love both films equally; especially when you consider that 'Reservoir...' was made for only 1.5 million dollars. AND! It was a directorial debut ('Pulp's budget was about 8 1/2 mil; equally impressive). Compared to all the mega million dollar movies, you wonder when will Hollywood learn that age old lesson that the 1st step to a great film is the step that costs the least: the Script.Minor spoilers! A movie about a jewel heist...but you never see the heist. A scene where the crime boss outlines the plan...but the scene cuts before he begins (a very hysterical exchange between crime boss Joe and the 'dogs'; no way am I going to reveal more). In fact, it's criminal to reveal much of anything. Do yourself a favor: if you haven't seen this, don't ruin it for yourself by reading reviews that simply regurgitate the plot. This film's magic works on each element of information carefully unfolding before the viewer. The story unravels! The viewer is hooked.The entire cast is top-notch. For one of the few times we're treated to 'acting' and 're-acting'; dialogue that responds to a response... to a response (etc.) to what was said. And small wonder there are legions of people that have the monologues memorized. It's priceless.Yes...the violence IS disturbing...the way violence really is (there's something very wrong when violence becomes entertaining which this film does NOT do...then again that may depend upon the viewer's perception).And the new DTS sound transfer on the 10th anniversary edition makes the gunfire blast that much more powerful and disturbing. And how about that 'K-Billy's Super Sounds of the 70's'.Now the screen aspect ratio. From the deleted scenes on the bonus material, it's looks like the film was shot at the 1:66 format (which fills the TV screen a little more than the usual widescreen 1:85 format, and a lot more than the very wide 2:35 format). Usually, I champion the wide screen format over full screen, providing that the widescreen format is a TRUE widescreen. This film is not It actually showed more on 'Resevior Dogs' 1st DVD release on the full screen side (and previous cable TV broadcasts). Because on a 1:66 ratio, when the transfer is zoomed in for the 3:4 standard TV; you, the viewer don't lose much visual information. But it was theatrically released in the 2:35 ratio. The point is: the 10th Annivesary Edition took it's full screen transfer from the 'already' zoomed in 2:35 (all you thousands reading this, raise your hand if you don't understand!).An homage to a 25 minute segment from a Hong Kong film called 'City On Fire'. Simular plot outline, that's it! These 2 movies are very different. And Tarantino proves that 'novel rules' works on the film format too.Oh! Did I say that amidst all the mayhem, how funny this movie is?Sorry I can't reveal more. On the other hand...Not Sorry!10 out of 10!",10,1,3,31 August 2002
Pulp Fiction," A Rosebud for the 90's
","It must tickle Tarantino to no end to read or listen to all the self-proclaimed 'experts' who dissect and analyze every scene, shot and line; and apply their religious or mythic interpretations; then proceed to pat themselves on the back for their ingenuity. Yes...this movie is chock-full of subtexts and inside references (and plenty of homages to movies past), but the bottom line is: it's not so much original as it is combining so many elements of comedy sketches and classic Story chestnuts wrapped in some great soundtracks. And the results explode like a blast of fresh air. So just sit back and enjoy the ride!Not that there is anything new to his approach. 'Citizen Kane' (non-linear story) and 'American Graffiti' (scenes written to fit an existing soundtrack) and even 'Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein' (The comedy/horror movie) are just a few examples of popular re-inventions. But Tarantino's approach are more like reminders of combining many more elements of great movies (or great movie scenes) and making those reminders seem like re-inventions. Is there anything wrong with that? Not a chance! Not when the end film has so much wit, intelligence and energy. It's time for guilty pleasure!Every actor (to the small bit parts) is perfectly cast, to single one performance over another would be an unjust slight. This is not a competition of who comes off best, this is a massive group of a labor of love everyone involved must have relished (including the technicians) so that the story comes first and everyone has their chance to shine when it serves the story to do so. The direction, camera angles and editing causes the movie to unfold much like a book, which may qualify it as being a visual 'page-turner'; you can't wait to see what happens next. And just when you think the movie is going to turn right; BAM! off it goes again on another left turn. This was one of the first movies I'd had seen in a long time that I wasn't able to predict on what was going to happen next (with so many movie cliches where the hero gets violent revenge 'At The End', the hero's side-kick is killed off two-thirds of the way thru, the damsel in distress stupidly allows herself to being captured, dialogue that is 'dumbed-down' to appeal to the (so called) mass).To get the most from this entertainment, it's best to know nothing about it other than the info on the DVD jacket. To reveal ANYTHING is to rob yourself of a great movie viewing (and listening) experience. So...you won't find any lazy re-hashing of the plot in this review.The 'Collector's Edition'('s) DTS sound is fantastic and is a huge improvement over the 5.1 Dolby Digital's earlier DVD release. If you love the movie, then you'll enjoy the wealth of bonus material.(Very subtle spoiler) Alright! I'll indulge just this once, concerning the contents of the briefcase. I don't buy the voodoo religious suggestion that the case contains the soul of Marcellous Wallace in spite of the 666 or the band-aid on the back of his neck (a happy accident for interpretation because actor Ving Rhames had a scar that needed covering). I've heard gold bricks; an Oscar; even the holy grail. I think Tarantino just put a gold glow there to create massive theories and arguments (brilliant ploy). BUT, if I had to pick: taking into account the director's love of movies, the characters' reaction and subsequent action to steal it (including Brett & party; especially Pumpkin's reaction: 'Is that what I think it is??' which Jules confirms) I wouldn't mind thinking that the contents refers to the 1941 classic directed by John Huston that begins the story in 1539 of 'a Golden Falcon encrusted from beak to claw with the rarest of jewels' and how history showed what little regard some people placed on the value of human life to gain its possession. NOW...everything fits into place! But, that's only if I HAD to pick.10 out of 10! Probably the movie of the decade.",10,4,8,25 August 2002
Titanic," No 'Night To Remember'
","Watching 'Titanic' was like having 2 people wrestle with a remote channel changer. Just when the movie becomes (historically) interesting, the other person grabs the remote and switches it to a pedestrian daytime soap opera. Did Kate have to be on hand at every step that led to the sinking? (her and Leo are on the side of the deck where the ice hits, of course, JUST missing them; OH! let's put her next to the Captain when he learns Titanic's fate and lack of life boats). The tragedy was story enough and James Cameron did a brilliant business decision to shove a pre-teen love opera to the foreground so girls could flock to the theater over and over to see Leo alive again and again and again...! Give the channel changer back so we can please continue with the story of the ship. Yes, I heard some crying when Leo sank into the abyss...But no sniveling when the little boy (who Leo tries to rescue before the boy is grabbed away from his panicky father) is swept away by the flooded corridor. So much for crying priorities!!I'm a big Cameron fan! Titanic has left him permanently wealthy. And he's tapped into a genre the same way Lucas tapped with Star Wars in attracting a select category of people that were willing to see this over and over (Titanic's billion dollar revenue was the result of many repeat viewings worldwide combining history with poster boy imagery).Special effects were brilliant! But I'll take the 1958 black and white 'A Night To Remember' movie instead.Today's lesson: If you're going to use an ax to free someone shackled with chains, don't aim, close your eyes tight, THEN swing hard so you won't see the spraying blood. This is life and death...better leave it to luck!7 out of 10",7,10,18,2 July 2002
The Godfather: Part III," Rehash, Retread! Oh, to be at the 1st Script Reading!
","Coppola is very gifted. That said, place some blame where it belongs and that's Paramount. Puzo took over 3 years to research and write The Godfather; then several months with Coppola to write the screenplay, ..it shows. In Godfather PART II, Coppola had only 3 months, but had obviously wanted to make some statements with the 1st movie, so some of those ideas had been simmering for 2 years (plus Puzo already had the background story written of Vito's rise to power) and that high quality shows too. Now Part III! Coppola and Puzo wanted 6 months to write, and release at the end of 1991. Paramount allowed only 6 WEEKS, and demanded a release for the 1990 year-end holiday season. So...the writing team had to take a 'if it ain't broke don't change it' attitude, and THAT shows too.One can only speculate (humorously) how that 1st script reading went when they gathered all the principles together: (SPOILERS from all 3 movies)COPPOLA: 'Welcome everybody to our first reading of The Godfather Part III. (Applause) Now during this run-thru, I'd like everyone to stay in character, so I'll be referring to everyone by their character names. Ready???  This is how Part III will be fresh and different.  First off, this movie is going to begin...With a Celebration!'   MICHAEL: 'But I thought that's how we started 1 & 2? ' COPPOLA: 'That's right! But in the first one I was trying to show the family warmth under Vito's regime and in the second one I was showing how it was getting colder under Michael's regime.'  MICHAEL: 'So what's different?'  COPPOLA: 'Well this time we're going back to the warmth, cause last time it was cold.'  MICHAEL: 'Oh!'  COPPOLA: 'Then we're going to do a family portrait with everyone posing. And just before the photographer clicks...'  KAY: 'I know! I know! Michael's going to say 'Wait a minute', walk over to where I'm standing, grab me and walk me back so I can be in the photo too.'  COPPOLA: 'No-ooo... I said this was going to be different! This time Michael will say 'HOLD IT!', grab Vincent so HE can be in the photo.' KAY: 'Oh!'  COPPOLA: Then we're going to have Tom Hagen say to Michael that Luca Brasi wants to see him and Michael will be kinda nervous and sort of stammer 'Is this necessary?''   MICHAEL: 'I just talked to Tom yesterday and he says he can't be in the movie cause the pay ain't high enough. And Luca's dead! And do I have to say that line cause Vito already said that in the first movie when Tom told HIM about Luca being at the wedding.'  COPPOLA: 'Alright! then we'll have Al Neri say that Joey Zaza wants to see you and you say, 'Do I have to see him?' Is that better?'   KAY: 'A Dance! We gotta have a Dance!'  COPPOLA: 'That's right! And in this one the Don is going to dance with his daughter.'  CONNIE: 'But Vito already danced with me at the end of my wedding in the first one. And we danced to the 'Godfather Waltz'. Remember??'  COPPOLA:  'That's right! But in this one, Don Michael, not Don Vito, will dance with his daughter Mary.'  MICHAEL: 'Are we going to play the same waltz that was played 35 years ago?...cause they've had some good dance tunes during the past few years you can really danc...'  COPPOLA: 'No-ooo...we're going to play the same waltz because it will remind the audience of what a great time they had watching the first movie. And we're going to stretch it by playing the waltz over and over while I show the chandelier.'   MARY: 'Why do we need to show the chandelier?'   COPPOLA: 'Because this movie has STYLE and I want to show that Mary is the light of Michael's life.'  MARY: 'Oh!'  COPPOLA: 'And I want all the guys to wear black suits and all the girls to wear deep red or gold gowns.'  CONNIE: 'But Francis, this is 1979, nobody wears all the same colors anymore. In fact, they didn't even wear the same colors in the two other movies. There's this word I saw in the dictionary called 'variety'; I read it, and it means...' COPPOLA: 'Anyone not wearing their assigned colors will not be allowed in the party. We already had variety in the other movies and I said this would be different.'   CONNIE:  'Oh!'  COPPOLA: ' Now, later on Michael will send Vincent to go undercover to visit Don Altobella because he wants to find out what he's got under his toes.'   MICHAEL:  'WAA-AAI-IT A MINUTE! Didn't Vito try that little trick when he sent Luca over to the Tattaglias to find out more about the turk Sollozo? And they figured that scheme out kinda quick because, correct me if I'm wrong, Luca ain't with us today because of that little stunt. And besides! The proper term is to find out what he's got under his fingernails, not toes. Why would you have me send Vincent to check out the guy's toes for????'   COPPOLA: 'Alright...FINGERNAILS!! Ya happy?? Then we're going to have Vincent 'make his bones' on Joey Zaza, and it will be during a Catholic parade and there'll be a police officer involved and...'   MICHAEL: 'Hold up Francis! If I remember right, Vito 'made his bones' on Fanucci during a Catholic parade; and I 'made my bones' on Capt McCluskey who was a police officer. Am I right or am I right?  COPPOLA: 'That's right! But this time 'Vincent' is the police officer and the last time the parade was going east and this time it will be coming from the west.'  MICHAEL: 'But if the parade is coming from the west, then it's STILL going east'   COPPOLA: 'Then we'll shoot it so people will think it's going west, but they'll be reminded of the parade from the second movie and remember what a good time they had watching it.'   B J HARRISON:  'Jeeszee Francis...sounds like we're going over familiar ground here'   COPPOLA: 'What's YOUR beef? What have you been in the last 10 years? If we paid Tom the money he asked for, you wouldn't even be sitting here. Oh! That reminds me! Vincent... can you ride a horse?   VINCENT: A Horse????  In Brooklyn?? Why would I have wanted to take the time to learn how to ride a horse for??? I'm a Corleone outcast! I grew up in a concrete jungle in a tough neighborhood...not out west! They've got some modern inventions in New York called subways and taxis and cars, and they can get me to wherever I want to go faster than any horse I know. And where do I find a poopie scooper big enough to pick up the kind of mess THEY leave behind? And besides... I don't remember you asking Michael to jump on a horse and go chasing after Sollozo. And what about Sonny? I think my dad would've looked kind of assinine gallopping after Carlo and telling HIM to get out of town. And what's with this 'Yippee-kai-yea'?  I gotta say 'Yippee-kai-yea' while I'm shooting Joey Zaza?? COPPOLA: 'Alright! Just say his name once or twice...then shoot him.' KAY: 'But the new stuff? When do we get to the new stuff?'  VINCENT: (under his breath) 'This horse thing sounds kinda new to me.'  CONNIE: 'But we had a horse in the first movie.'  COPPOLA: 'Nooo...we had PART of a horse in the first movie. This is different!'  VINCENT: (still under his breath) 'Yeah...REAL different!'   KAY: 'But some GOOD new stuff! When do we get to the GOOD new stuff? And what about me? What do I get to do?'  COPPOLA: 'Well I was coming to that...but first we've got to have a scene in Italy with Don Tommasino inside the villa.'  MICHAEL: 'The same villa where the car blew up?'  COPPOLA: 'That's right! And in this scene we'll give Vincent an orange.'   VINCENT: (irritably) 'What for??'  COPPOLA:  'Because the orange is a symbol of evil and we need to show it to the audience.' VINCENT: 'So what do I do with it?'   COPPOLA: 'I don't know! Sniff it!'  VINCENT: 'But I KNOW what an orange smells like.'  COPPOLA:  'Well after you sniff it, bounce it up in the air a couple of times and catch it one handed.' VINCENT: 'Com-on Francis! It's gonna be hot. I'll be hungry. Why don't I just eat it.'  COPPOLA: 'That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. Do you want the audience to look at a mutilated half-eaten orange? The whole symbolic evil thing will go right out the window.'  VINCENT: 'But oranges can be slippery. When I catch it, can't I use two hands?'  COPPOLA: 'Now I've heard everything! You want to be the new Don? You want to learn underworld business, double crosses, billions of dollars of legal and illegal revenue?...and you don't want to take 10 minutes to learn how to catch an orange one handed.  VINCENT: 'Well I don't remember Michael or even Vito having to learn to catch an orange one handed. How come I'm getting all this new stuff?'  COPPOLA:  'Alright, we'll get you a kitten. Vito had to handle a kitten in the first movie at Connie's wedding. And a kitten moves. And it makes noise. And it has claws. Is that what you want? You want to be bouncing a kitten up in the air while you're talking to Don Tommasino? Cause if you catch it wrong I don't want to be within a hundred yards of you and some teed off kitten.'  VINCENT: 'Alright, I'll learn this orange thing, but I gotta tell you, all this new stuff keeps getting worse.'   KAY: 'Me!!What about me!!  COPPOLA: 'I'm getting to that. Now Michael, I've been watching you rehearse your last scene. You're falling out of the chair okay, but you're not dropping the orange right.'  MICHAEL: 'That's cause I don't want to hit the puppy.'  COPPOLA:  'Then keep one eye open so you miss the puppy.'  MICHAEL:  'You want me to gasp my last, drop the orange, slump over, fall out AND keep one eye open. Won't the audience see I have one eye open?'  COPPOLA:  'No, because just before you slump, put your sunglasses on.'   KAY:  'But me!! How about me?? What do I get to do?'  COPPOLA: 'Well Kay, when you go to visit Michael at the hospital, I want you to walk DRAMATICALLY into his room.'   KAY: 'You mean walk dramatically up to his bed??'  COPPOLA:  'No...pretend you're walking around the block to get to your next door neighbors' house, because I'm trying to show that there's still some distance between you and Michael.'   KAY: 'Like this?? You want me to walk dramatically like this???'   COPPOLA:  'Let's keep it down everybody! People in the back...no more snickering out loud while Kay works on her dramatic walk.'   MICHAEL: (from the back) 'Hey Francis! I hear Johnny Fontaine is coming to the party to sing another love song like he sang at my sister's wedding.'   COPPOLA: 'That's right!'   MICHAEL:  'Who is he going to sing to this time?'For me, the end of the story will always be the last scene in Godfather PART II that shows Michael contemplating the consequences of his actions. That haunting image says more in 10 seconds than anything that followed in Part III.Conclusion: They tried! Vatican sequences was intriging. But you can't take a pint to fill a gallon container. The Godfather and The Godfather PART II will always be a milestone in movie history and Part III will never take that away. I'll wait till they put the uncensored Godfather Novel For Television in chronological order on DVD (without Part III) before I buy it...or not buy it at all!",6,3,7,21 June 2002
Army of Darkness," Laughed My Ash Off!!
","I'm not an 'Evil Dead' fan. I've only seen 1 & 2 once some dozen years back (in the same weekend). Having said that, I am getting antsy to give them another shot. So I'm probably part of the minority that thoroughly enjoyed part 3 over it's predecessors. Why? Director Rami was beginning to graduate into a more polished film maker by this time with less of the rough edges that were in the first two (many may rightfully debate that this is part of their 'cult status' appeal). And Campbell had many moments that proves he's 'leading man' material. His acting is much more assured and FUNNY in this one.So at $12.99 plus tax for the 'Official Bootlegger's Director Cut', just couldn't pass it up. Love that original ending (equally love the 'reshot' ending too!). Miss that 'I'm the guy with the gun' line though. And Campbell and the Rami's bantering in the commentary made me a believer that some commentaries are worth listening to (which usually aren't justified except as an added selling tool).7 out of 10! Wish there were more movies that were this much fun.",Null,1,1,29 March 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," What Tolkien Did For Literature; Jackson Has Done For Film!
","No matter what anyone says; Jackson and Co. did the near impossible. They brought their vision (& sound) to worldwide acclaim to the best heroic-fantasy film ever made (and likely for many decades, this will be the film to top).Having read LOTR 33 years ago (& 14 times since), I also had certain prejudices on how the story could justifiably be filmed. And the same thing happened that happened with 'Fellowship...' and '...Towers'. I enjoyed the 2nd & 3rd viewing more than the 1st. Why? Because of a visual interpretation that had been stewing for over 30 years. Film is a different medium. As Jackson stated: 'You just can't shoot LOTR as is'. So alot of dramatic licences were taken that were minor diviations. And once you surrender yourself to the film makers vision, the rewards are enormous.No... Sam would never have abandoned Frodo at anytime during the quest no matter how hurt his feelings were. But so what! He returns with a vengence. His absence allows more of a thrill to Shelob's deadly threat, especially when you take into account that the majority of the movie-goers will have not read the book.One reason the film 'Lord of the Rings' (notice I didn't say films or that over-used label...'trilogy') works so well against all odds is because the production team never lost sight of the story's heart. And the only way to do justice to the heart of the story was to present it in the length that this film deserved. Applaud Jackson & Team the courage to slow the action down and display the loyalty and love that existed between the characters. Because the characters cared so much for each other for honorable reasons; we, the audience, were able to jump on the care wagon right alongside them.And applaud New Line Cinema for taking the biggest gamble in movie history (and shame on Weinstein for thinking it could all be done in 2 hours; why is his name even in the credits?)The Minas Tirith battle was beyond expectation.The book is not without flaws (but still remains my favorite). Neither is the movie! But because it was done with so much meticulous care and detail, the flaws are forgivable and forgettable (huh? what flaws?).
Minor Spoiler: Always felt the book's Crack of Doom's climax was a tad weak with Gollum's careless trip over the brink. But what if...According to the appendices: Sauron had already begun to take shape at Deagle's finding of the ring 500 years before the fellowship (may not be accurate). And when Frodo stands at the brink of the fire and claims the ring as his; Sauron is suddenly aware of him. And in an earth-shattering roar of terror and fear, he summons his most foul beast, instantly mounts and crashes forth through the top of Barad-dur and races toward Mount Doom. And Gollum and Frodo are grappling for final possession of the ring when Sauron and beast burst forth through the doorway's opening. And instinctive reaction causes them both to topple over (Frodo is saved because he lets go of the ring). And Gollum plunges down as Sauron hurtles toward him. And Sauron's beast grabs Gollum just as Gollum hits the fire, but not enough to prevent Sauron to rear his beast upwards in time to prevent the 3 of them to be engulfed by the molten lava. And Sauron makes a grab for the ring just before it is unmade. And...and...Naa-aa-ah! That may have upset the many leagues of Tolkien purists. Besides...I'm out of breath just thinking of the sequence done that way. Don't matter cause the movie still gets a 10 overall.
As far as I'm concerned, the theatrical release is a major tease to the extended version that will (will it?) be released in late 2004.Christmas ain't over yet. Bring on 'The Hobbit'.",10,0,1,28 December 2003
Gangs of New York," A 'Folklore of Bill the Butcher' has been born!
","It took 2 viewings to promote this film from being very good (the 1st time)...to being great! (2nd time). And an example of fine film making. An astute reviewer once said of John Ford's 'The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance' (1962) that it was panned upon it's original release, but all Ford scholars now regard it as an American classic. I wouldn't be surprised if, down the road, history sheds light and provokes the same reaction among film scholars toward Scorsese's epic.Towering above the grand and detailed setting of mid 19th century New York ('Noo Yawk') is Daniel Day Lewis. His performance as William Cutting (a walking nightmare of Charles Dicken's most unscrupulous characters, complete with stovepipe hat and gangling stride) is the most electrifying I've seen in years. He is both charismatic and cruel. Symbolic, yet seemingly spontaneous. It's hard to believe that this is the same actor from 'My Left Foot' and 'Last of the Mohicans', to name just two. It's difficult to not be in awe of his chameleon capabilities. If he decides to stay in semi-retirement, his place in acting history is still immortalized. It is we, the rest of the world, that will be the loser.DiCaprio (very believable, more so than 'Titanic') and Diaz perform just fine to create a compelling conflict. You feel their characters wallowing in a dirty, disgusting environment with just enough pride to raise their heads above the muck of life in 1862 to survive with a sense of honor. This is not a world you'd want to walk in without a clothes pin over your nose.Lifting elements from 'The Bowery'(1933) and especially Sergio Leone's 'Once Upon A Time In The West'(1969), Scorsese successfully creates a fictional story of revenge against the backdrop of Five Points that led to the 4 day Draft Riots of the Civil War. After watching this, it's 'Thank you! Thank you!' for being born in the 20th century.Not for all tastes, especially if you're looking for clean cut, sympathetic characters with fine pressed shirts.Still...I wonder if the director has his own cut to be released on dvd that won't be hampered by theater showtime restrictions. Some story lines could have been further fleshed out.After seeing this movie, I picked up 'Last of the Mohicans' on dvd (with DTS sound...what a bonus). And I'm still captivated by Day Lewis' performance. Selfishly, I hope his cobbler business goes under.9 out of 10 !",8,0,0,15 January 2003
The Godfather," As Perfect as Godfather is: No Definitive Version!
","Godfather and PART II are examples of elite filmmaking. Anyone seeing them for the first time should introduce themselves to the theatrical versions (Part III is good - the Vatican sequences are brilliant - but it's just not in the same league; many scenes were just recaps of what we saw [better] in I & II) ( PART II also recaps some scenes from the original, but they were presented on the 'flipside' - and it worked).Now a very positive gripe: 'The Godfather: A Novel for Television' was first broadcast in 1977, it has recently resurfaced on some cable channels (covers I & II in chronological order and retitled The Godfather Saga). What's frustrating is that now, no matter what version I see, I can't help feeling I'm watching an abridged film. For 99.9% of all films, who would care; but this is storytelling at its finest. PART II was innovative for its prequel/sequel presentation that shows (SUBTLE SPOILERS) the irony of the rise and fall of a powerful crime dynasty. But now (I know I'm not alone) after seeing the outakes inserted where they should be, this has made the viewing so much more enriching, especially if you've read Mario Puzo's novel. The problem is that not only is the saga censored (reasonable enough for TV fare), but they've trimmed some lines of dialogue from the theatrical version (I'm not talking about lines containing profanity) apparently for time constraint. What makes the theatrical version more difficult to enjoy now is that the outakes are better pieces of filmaking than 90% of the movies out there (I knew this gripe would turn into a compliment). And in putting it in chronological order, the irony is lessened, but in no way is it lost. The viewer is allowed to see an American tragedy unfold.I did tape a local broadcast of the 'saga' in 1988 and again on AMC recently and both versions of THOSE have little scenes that the other doesn't have. EXAMPLE: At the end of Godfather, the scene fades to black (1955), then fades up to show Michael Corleone (now in 1958) walking along his Nevada lakeside estate in the wee hours of the morning of his son's communion/celebration. It's a well done transition scene that's in the 88' telecast, but not in the recent ones (from a fade to black, it almost jump cuts to the party and Fredo's entrance with wife Deanna). Even the bonus disc of the DVD that contains deleted scenes (separate from the films) don't contain all of them. Just one example is (from Godfather I), the first scene that introduces Don Corleone, after the undertaker Bonasera exits the Don's study, Sonny is sternly chastised by the Don for not paying attention (that was worth seeing just to hear Marlon Brando whistle). It's duration is only about 10 seconds long, but it cements the fact that Sonny is the intended Don in training who still needs tweaking by his father.This is damn fine filmmaking that captures the texture and atmosphere of the time told in the story; be it early 1900's, mid 40's thru the late 50's and Coppola successfully borrowed from the styles of moviemaking, styles lifted from the 20's, 40's and 50's. Movies over 50 years ago didn't have fancy subjective camera moves and Coppola's decision to film using old fashion techniques makes you feel you're watching a film from that time era (I realize this was early 70's, but new wave style and zip zooms had been around for 10 years[?] ).I'm confident that hundreds of thousands (millions ?) of movie lovers would immerse themselves in a longer UNCUT version that is no longer constrained by theatrical time factors. 7 hours and 15 minutes (not including end credits and no Part III) would be impossible in a theater, but this is the age of home entertainment (still can't beat watching a movie in the theater) that allows freedom AND a stop button (2 or 3 well placed intermissions would be better). That means you're saddled with more footage of Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert DeNiro, Robert Duvall, James Caan, John Cazale, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire...ect giving us some of the finest performances in their careers. Any complaints about that?? Special mention to all but especially James Caan who lost so much footage to the cutting room floor. During the 2nd act of the Godfather, James Caan and Al Pacino are the stars of the movie as the story flips back and forth between the two; after all Sonny is the heir apparent. To show how instrumental he was to the family by exposing his leadership ability and softer side made what follows that much more shocking.No, I didn't buy the DVD (I did rent the bonus disc) for these reasons. I'll wait till they reconstruct the saga on a new DVD edition(if rumors are true) but please...no Part III.(Subtle Spoiler) Note: Never was comfortable when Godfather PART II changed Vito's birthday from April 28,1887 (The Godfather -cemetery monument) to 1892 (from the opening 'In 1901 the godfather was born Vito...he was nine years old!) Marlon Brando's closing scenes led you to believe the 1887 birthdate.Francis Coppola is an artistic genius, he's never made up his mind to stop tinkering with editing the saga. Even the Godfather Epic 1902-1959 contained only some deleted scene and excised 2 or 3 scenes from the theatrical version. I'm looking forward to THE version where all the scenes are left intact.The Godfather   10 out of 10 The Godfather PART II   10 out of 10 The Godfather Saga (uncensored)  a  10+",10,0,1,5 June 2002
