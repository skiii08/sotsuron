The Blair Witch Project," DIDN'T MEET THEY HYPE
","Saw the flick last night.  Film was good, but didn't meet the hype.  I thought I was going to be on the edge of my seat in fear the whole movie - I wasn't.  The last five minutes or so was the scariest part of the movie. The rest of the stuff was a rather uninteresting build-up.The movie definitely stands out from the rest of the Hollywood offerings. See the movie if you are looking to check out a film that has done a good job at parting from the traditional camera shots and dialogue.Still don't plan to see this movie if you are looking for a horror flick that is going to give you nightmares and sleeping problems.",5,0,1,4 August 1999
