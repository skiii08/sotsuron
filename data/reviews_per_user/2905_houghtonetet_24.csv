Despicable Me 2," Satisfying sequel
","Here is Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud's second offering of the Steve Carell-voiced bogeyman, Mr Gru, and his anarchic, sweetcorn-shaped servants, the Minions.Once again, the co-directors have put together a humorous and well-crafted 100 minutes of CGI entertainment that went down well with those children of all ages who watched it. Gru has moved away from the Dark Side and is now a responsible step-father of the three orphans he took under his wing in the first movie. He has also abandoned crime and villainy in favour of a failing attempt to make jams and jellies.Unfortunately he cannot escape his past, and he finds himself embroiled in a fairly simple plot to recover a stolen item. I shouldn't give away too many spoilers but really there isn't a great deal to give away - U-rated films are never strong on plot and script! Lol.What does stand out is Gru's determination to stay on the straight and narrow, and even more than that are the antics of the Minions, who have amazing chemistry and effortlessly lift up the movie.If I have any criticisms it is that the film could have made more of its opportunities for the Minions to create mayhem, too much screen time was in the Mall and Dr Nefario was underused. Minor criticisms though.If you have kids they will love this, and you will love it as well anyway! A very agreeable 100 minutes of entertainment. 8/10",8,1,3,6 July 2013
Skyfall," Worthy addition to the Bond franchise
","Bond celebrates his 50th anniversary with this entertaining and enjoyable helping of highly improbable espionage. The franchise has developed over the decades beyond self-parody, and is still developing. Many scenes and situations in Skyfall reflect the modern, shadowy threats to today's society, and in M's public humiliation before a Select Committee, MI6 is reminded it is ultimately accountable to the public. That said, the usual stunts and chases are all there in abundance, together with some sharp banter between Bond and his superiors, his sidekicks, and his deliciously creepy enemy, (played with relish by Javier Bardem). Skyfall benefited from the talents not only of the wonderful Judi Dench and ever dependable Ralph Fiennes but also of the highly promising Naomie Harris and Ben Whishaw, who I feel will make Q every bit an institution as Desmond Llewellyn did. If you add in some stunning sequences in Turkey, Shanghai, and Scotland, you have a movie that stands comparison with any other Bond movie (apart from the recent Casino Royale).The movie was not flawless – there were some gaps that I found puzzling, ie how did Silva escape from his cell in London? What happened to the stolen list of agents? Who was Patrice hired to assassinate and why? How did Bond miraculously recover his shooting skills after failing his fitness test?The film is well worth a viewing – I enjoyed it very much.",8,1,5,7 December 2012
Gravity," Astonishing space drama
","Alfonso Cuaron directs his first movie since Children of Men in 2006 with this breathtaking survival drama set in orbit about the Earth. The hostility and beauty of space is brought to the screen in a quite spectacular manner, with stunning views of our beautiful planet dominating the screen. Its serenity really needs to be seen on a cinema screen to be fully appreciated, although I was surprised the Moon didn't feature at all, even at long range.Only two actors appear in this film. George Clooney is the veteran Kowalski and Sandra Bullock is the rookie Stone. Clooney is, well, George Clooney as we all know him, acting as though it were all a walk in the park. He might have been on the set of Ocean's Thirteen. This gave centre stage to Sandra Bullock, whose film this was. She has been in a spate of disappointing films these last few years (apart from Crash), so it was great to see her carry this film with no little conviction through some scenes of panic, exhaustion, hopelessness, determination, and whatever emotion is required to confront such an awesome sequence of disasters. I think her performance is worth at least a Nomination for Best Actress.I loved the long takes and the silences. I thought the 3D was impressive but not overpowering.I have learned that the interiors of the ISS and the Soyuz modules have been verified by astronauts and after a diet of iPod-style ship interiors from Star Trek I was surprised at the clunky nature of the technology on display. (You certainly wouldn't get me up there in one of those things!)If I could find a fault (being picky) I was surprised at the length of time Stone kept breathing excessive CO2 at a certain point, I don't think the film would have suffered if she had had a little more O2 in the tank at that point. I also didn't understand the purpose behind the dog howling. This must have been a transmission from Earth, I am not sure how it fit in with the film.Anyway, a triumph in cinematography and panicky suspense – don't miss it. 9/10.",9,4,6,3 December 2013
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," The war in Star Wars
","Gareth Edwards here presents a worthy addition to the Star Wars canon, telling the tale of how the original Death Star plans were stolen and transmitted to the Rebel Alliance. The film fits seamlessly into the timeline, but is of a wholly different nature to the previously released seven movies.This film is darker and grittier, and does not shy away from the bitterness and loss of war. There is some good acting here and a fair amount of psychology between many of the actors. The CGI is used moderately and not unnecessarily. There was a good feeling of 'reality' on many of the planetary scenes. Some characters from Star Wars IV are present but are not used out of proportion to their involvement.Humour comes mostly from K-2SO, a re-programmed Imperial droid. The two leads, Felicity Jones as Jyn Erso, the daughter of the Death Star's designer, and Diego Luna as Cassian Andor, a rebel captain, are intense and fit the mood of the film very well. There is good support from actors on both sides of the conflict.There are no Jedi in this movie, but there is a priest who uses the Force in combat, and Darth Vader shows a trick or two, especially near the end, so the film suffers in that respect, but more than makes up for it in the quality of the set design and effects, the absorbing and interesting story, the chemistry between characters on both sides, the clever splicing in of rebel captains from A New Hope in their fighters, and the obvious love and care with which this film has been crafted.See this movie, you won't regret it.",10,1,6,24 December 2016
Passengers," Well acted and beautifully presented
","I went to see this film not sure of what to expect, other than the basic 'Robinson Crusoe' concept of a man stranded on a long journey in space. I knew the critics had panned it but the visuals looked great in the trailerPassengers turned out to be a simple but beautiful movie carried effortlessly by the two leads. This is not an action adventure movie, rather a study of humanity and how people react when given extreme choices. I thought the acting was first class – Jennifer Lawrence surely has to get an Oscar Nomination for this – the ship was luxurious and well-appointed, and was of an intriguing design.I can see why it has been criticised – there is a surprising lack of fail-safe and emergency procedures in the event of calamity; I didn't understand why any Passenger couldn't be returned to suspended animation once awakened; and even I spotted that Arcturus couldn't be reached in 30 years if the Avalon is travelling at half the speed of light.These plot-holes do not detract from the effectiveness and enjoyment of the film, though. Its 116 minutes slipped by effortlessly and I felt that my admission had been well spent.Highly recommended – 9/10",9,5,9,9 January 2017
Star Trek Into Darkness," Intelligent blockbuster
","JJ Abrams does not disappoint with this highly impressive sequel to his 2009 'franchise reboot.' He is clearly a keen fan of Gene Roddenberry's 60s TV series, with many references to it. There was, apparently, long discussions as to whether this movie should be an adventure of discovery, somewhat like the 60s TV series, or another battle against a villain. I think the right choice was made, there is obviously a great deal of life to come yet in this franchise and some loose ends were wrapped up in this movie quite neatly.Abrams gives us a thriller which effortlessly leaps from one astonishing CGI set-piece to another, allied to a sharp script, some impressive acting, fast pacing, and always with a little humour here and there. He also builds up Kirk's character quite considerably this time. Chris Pine doesn't simply play 'Kirk the Jerk' but shows more emotion and a greater range of acting. Ben Cumberbatch plays a deliciously icy villain who it is possible to feel sympathy for, if you think about his character, and there is good support from the usual gang. Simon Pegg gets a lot more screen time this time round, but Anton Yeltsin is sidelined a little, I thought. Karl Urban's Bones frets a lot, John Cho's Sulu gets a taste of command, and Zoe Saldana gets to continue her relationship with Spock and prove to be pivotal in one key scene. Zachary Quinto's Spock towers over the whole film, he was born to play this character and never puts a foot or a heartbeat wrong, he was quite simply amazing, stealing every scene he was in.If I could be incredibly picky I would say the only disappointment was the physical appearance of the Klingons, who I prefer as the swarthy pirate-types seen in the TV series rather than the Yorkshire-pudding heads they later became, but that is a detail.Credit to Abrams for providing a plot deep with messages about loyalty and comradeship, of the need to reign in recklessness and obey regulations, (and my daughter now has her heart set on owning a tribble!)Two hours slipped by in a few moments, do try and see this movie, it will be time and money well spent.10/10",10,6,20,17 May 2013
Ted," Not really all that funny
","If you're a fan of Family Guy then you will love this movie. If you, like me, are not, then you may, like me, struggle with the coarse, unfunny humour. Sorry but I just didn't find it really very funny and I thought it fell rather flat as a romantic comedy. I was unsure why the 'c' word was used in a 15-rated film and I wasn't too sure that an adult should punch a child unconscious, (even such a loathsome child, well-acted by the promising Aedin Mincks), but I suppose this was the writer trying to be clever and 'push the line of acceptability.' The film was only funny when Sam Jones was on screen.Mark Wahlberg was agreeable as the dim-witted lead, with good support from Joel McHale.Mila Kunis saves it.4/10.",4,1,4,28 August 2012
Oblivion," How can man die better: than facing fearful odds, For the ashes of his fathers, and the temples of his Gods
","An intelligent piece of sci-fi directed by Joseph Kosinski after adapting it from his own graphic novel and a more than competent second movie for him as a director (his first being the excellent Tron Legacy).There is action aplenty in the trailers but the movie itself is more measured and thoughtful. The film provides wave after wave of revelation that had me scratching my head at one point wondering how deep all of it would go. Fairly deep as it turned out. The minimal cast all acquit themselves well. Tom Cruise as Jack Harper carries the film with ease with good support from Andrea Riseborough as the sad and confused Victoria, and also the gorgeous Olga Kurylenko.Special effects were not overplayed, they didn't need to be, but there were some great scenes of the ruined Earth, ie the harbour of ships that is now a desert and the bombed Pentagon, etc etc.Last year's Prometheus should have been like this, and not the mindless rubbish it was, I wish more films had as much care and thought put into the storyline as Oblivion.Try and see this film before it expires at the cinema, you won't regret it.",9,2,4,7 May 2013
Now You See Me," Smug and stylish
","'The closer you look the less you'll see,' is the tagline for this stylish, superficial crime caper from director Louis Leterrier, whose previous directorial credits include the Edward Norton 'Incredible Hulk,' and 'Clash of the Titans.' Well I'm not sure what the tagline is getting at, other than a possibly general warning about magicians. The plot is a lot of smoke and mirrors, rather like the tricks the magicians play, and apart from the major twist near the end, is confusing. It was all rather like 'Ocean's Eleven' but with a weaker cast. Having said that, the script was pretty good and the actors carried it off very well, Woody Harrelson probably being the best of them. Jesse Eisenberg brought the same smug confidence he brought to 'The Social Network,' Morgan Freeman was excellent, as ever, but Michael Caine was underused. The tricks themselves were impressive, until you remember that Hollywood can do anything with special effects anyway. There looks as though there may be a sequel, but I'm not sure I will bother with it. 'Now You See Me,' won't trouble the Academy when they dole out the Oscars, but it's worth an evening of your time if you are at a loose end.",7,1,3,11 July 2013
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," For Potterheads only
","This is the other 'standalone' movie released for the Christmas holiday hanging on the back of a successful franchise (the other being Rogue One of the Star Wars universe). David Yates directs JK Rowling's spin-off about the writing of a textbook used at Hogwarts, the 'Fantastic Beasts' book of the movie title. This is a slight misnomer as very little writing or research took place of any description. The male lead, Eddie Redmayne's visiting wizard, Newt Scamander, promises to dedicate a copy of his book to the female lead, Katherine Waterstone's auror, Tina Goldstein. That seems to be about it as far as the textbook is concerned.Scamander is passing through New York en route to Arizona to release a Fantastic Beast via his suitcase, which acts as a gateway to an unspecified place, into the wild, but is arrested as an Unregistered Wizard and becomes (a) engaged in retrieving other Fantastic Beasts that have escaped from his suitcase after it has become inadvertently switched with a similar case carried by a muggle baker, and (b) embroiled in the increasingly tense situation between muggles (or No-Maj's as they are known in the US) and the wizarding community.Not a bad-sounding plot but as a non-Potter fan myself I found myself scratching my head at many of the developments in the movie. It would really pay to have read and understood the book before seeing the film to imprison an extremely large and threatening lizard-type creature. Quick! Put an insect in a teapot! ??? Err – OK...to catch an extremely large and threatening rhinoceros-type creature which is on heat and has a fancy for a nervous-looking hippopotamus. Perform a bizarre dance and make it roll on its back so you can put it in a suitcase! ??? If you say so The only character I really liked in this movie was the superb Dan Fogler as the muggle baker, Kowalski. His expression of bemusement was much the same as mine for at least three-quarters of this movie. I also liked the burgeoning romance between Kowalski and Goldstein's sister, Queenie, which turned out well in the end. The CGI was used a lot, but by definition of a wizarding movie, I suppose it must be.In short, a decent afternoon's entertainment which would have been helped by a little more explanation of the Fantastic Beasts themselves, but I doubt I'll see it again.",6,1,4,27 December 2016
Inside Out," Not for small children
","Here is a curious and original idea for a movie concerning the inner workings of the mind. Five core emotions govern the thoughts and actions of each of us throughout our lives. Everyone is subject to the control of the emotions to a lesser or greater degree, depending on which emotion dominates the individual's psycheFor children,generally, the hopelessly optimistic Happiness, or Joy, holds sway. Adults tended to be dominated by the more negative emotions.The film is about the feelings felt by an 11-year old girl uprooted from her childhood home to San Francisco because of her father's job; how she feels, how she reacts, what happens inside her head. It is a brave idea but is not appreciated by younger viewers, apart from the pretty pictures and colourful characters. I enjoyed it, but felt that the adults should have more than just the five basic emotions. Perhaps Pride, Greed, and Jealousy should have been present, each tempered by their opposite, Humility, Temperance, and Generosity. Maybe this would clutter the control room a little too much, though.The emotions were perfectly voiced and the animation was impressive, as always from Pixar. It's a good idea for a movie, but it isn't for laughs. The only humour was in the end credits. The preceding short, Lava, was dull.",6,5,26,11 September 2015
Wreck-It Ralph," Bad guys can be heroes
","I used to spend countless hours (and much money) in video-game arcades as a youth so I was naturally attracted to this original idea from Disney and I am so glad I saw it.It would be easy to see how this could be passed over as a simple kids film about characters in video games, but it is a lot more than that. The story is intriguing and engaging and deals with adult concepts such as jealousy and revenge alongside the more simple desire to be loved and appreciated. The dialogue is excellent and the characters are perfectly realised with the actors, particularly John McGinley, Jane Lynch and Sarah Silverman, putting the perfect pitch of emotion into their avatars.If I were to be really picky I could say that the film spent too much time in only two or three of the games in the arcade. I suppose the story would be complicated too much if the action were spread over many more games. I was also a little unimpressed with the 3D - I would advise anyone thinking of going to see it to stick with 2D.Minor quibbles though - this is a very enjoyable movie with a lot of heart and emotion and some magnificent action set pieces, especially the hectic 'Hero's Duty' game - thoroughly recommended.I should also mention the exquisite short that preceded the film, 'Paperman,' a b/w silent love story set in 50s New York - which ends just exactly the way you want every love story to end! A beautiful little cartoon - please, Disney, let's have many more like that.",9,2,3,24 February 2013
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," The Hobbit: Pretty much as expected
","After the critical acclaim and commercial success of the Lord of the Rings movies, it was somewhat inevitable that the Hobbit would also be given the big screen treatment. It remained to be seen whether the smaller book, the prequel, would be exploited to the max by the producers, but as it turned out, this is what happened.It is a little sad to report that the story has been sacrificed to the lust for gold, perhaps New Line execs all possess Dwarvish Rings of Power! The book is shorter and much lighter in tone than the LotR but the movie doesn't seem to know whether it wants to be a fairy story written for children or epic myth. The scenes I enjoyed most were of the former flavor, but it is understandable that the director, a lifelong Tolkien fan himself, should want to tie the film in as closely as possible with LotR, and indeed with some material also from Unfinished Tales.Personally, I would rather the film had been a little shorter, and spread over two episodes at the most, not three.I felt most of the changes made to the story itself worked rather well, for example, Gandalf freezing the trolls by breaking a rock to catch them by surprise. Some did not, for example, the stone giants almost killing the company rather than them being in the distance. Some of the additions worked, for example, the White Council meeting, some did not, for example, everything involving Azog and Radagast. The spying mission on Dol Guldur worked, (but I always thought it was Gandalf and not Radagast who did the spying).The acting was good, Martin Freeman was agreeable as the hero and the Dwarfs were all engaging and likable (I couldn't pick out a favourite, but Balin stood out in the crowd). The book I felt did not develop the Dwarfs too well as characters, but the movie was more successful in bringing their characters to life. Hugo Weaving, Ian McKellen, Cate Blanchett, Christopher Lee, and Andy Serkis all reprised their LotR roles with no suffering of continuity.My favourite scene was the party at Bag End, which was the correct genial tone for the movie as a whole, and should have been continued. I also particularly enjoyed the riddle game and the rescue by the Eagles. I did not like the CGI excesses in Goblintown, which put me in mind of the absurd dinosaur stampede in King Kong. I know the audience must suspend belief a little, but that scene was stretching it quite a bit! My teenaged offspring who saw it with me hugely enjoyed it, but they had not read the book. I know the book and the entire Middle-earth legend very well indeed and I must say this film was almost a success, but not quite. 9/10.",9,4,8,26 January 2013
Ex Machina," Disturbing thriller
","Caleb, (Domhnall Gleeson), is a youthful, mild-mannered programmer for a large internet search engine, Bluebook. He wins a company-wide prize to spend a week at the secluded home of the reclusive CEO of Bluebook, the laddish, slightly older Nathan, (Oscar Isaac), who likes his alcohol.On arrival, Caleb discovers his prize is to apply a Turing Test over seven days to Nathan's invention, an AI named Ava, (Alicia Vikander). He soon finds his stay loaded with doubt and desire as he is manipulated both by Nathan and the machine, and ends up under-estimating both of them.Director Alex Garland has fashioned a thought-provoking and disturbing film that examines some of the largest and oldest questions asked by humanity; what is it to be human? What is intelligence? Can people be gods? The conversations in which these and other concepts are explored were wordy but never dull or patronising. There was always enough of an edge to Nathan's character to make me wonder if he was playing a drunken lout just to trip Caleb up. Caleb found himself walking an increasingly unsteady tightrope as Ava drip-fed him information and revelations which led to the film's unpleasant and, I'm sad to say, slightly anti-climactic conclusion.I thought the acting was good and the script absorbing. The pace may not have been fast but was fine for the film to get its points across. I liked the contrast between the claustrophobic, minimalist house and the natural splendour that surrounded it. The lighting and cinematography were very good.This is a well-made and thoughtful film that made me wonder why at least a little morality wasn't programmed into Ava. Nathan's wordless servant Kyoko was self-aware, and Ava was the next step along, with her need for self-preservation, but she is not the final step. That will come when AIs feel responsible for their actions, but that is another story.",9,9,22,2 February 2015
Guardians of the Galaxy," Enjoyable romp across the stars
","Here is another successful Marvel adaptation for the big screen and the birth of another potentially long-running (and profitable) franchise. Chris Pratt stars as Peter Quill, or Star Lord as he prefers to be known as, an adventurer who lives by his wits and finds himself the quarry of menacing forces intent on retrieving a dangerous artifact he has stolen.He falls in with four unlikely comrades each with their own purpose, who at first are enemies but form an alliance that grows stronger throughout the movie, culminating with their friendship. This friendship overcomes all adversity and saves the day, and restores security to a peaceful world.It's not much of a plot but who cares? The film is supremely entertaining, with eye-popping CGI, a cheeky script, interesting and likable characters, warmth, humour, and a refreshing intent to not take itself at all seriously. The non-human characters, Rocket in particular, generate a surprising amount of sympathy and connect very well with the audience. Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, and Dave Bautista all carry the movie very well with a lightness of touch and an emotional depth many comic book adaptations lack.The politics behind the plot I felt was a little too complicated but necessary I suppose to hang future episodes on and to provide a framework for the five adventurers to continue their dubious path on both sides of the law. A sequel is planned for 2017 which I am already looking forwards to.See this film! Two hours will flash by in what seems like minutes, it will be a fun evening and money well spent.",9,1,5,15 August 2014
Les Misérables," Emotional tour de force
","I saw the stage production of Les Mis in Toronto in 1991 and enjoyed it hugely. My Canadian friend who took me there went with minimal make-up, saying she knew how emotional it could be. Well, there was plenty of streaming mascara that night as people were leaving the theatre, and there was even more snuffling going on all around me in the cinema this afternoon. (Including my teenaged daughter, who never cries at anything – so there is a cinematic first).I will get the negatives out of the way first, there are only two - (a) Gavroche seemed to have much less of an impact in the film than he did in the play, although Daniel Huttlestone was more than competent on screen. (b) I felt that Russell Crowe is not a singer by any stretch of the imagination. I am a big fan of his and he certainly looks the part of Javert and plays him very well, but a singer? No. I had to stifle a laugh during the opening scene at the shipyard, but to be fair that was probably his weakest song.Other than those minor criticisms I can safely say the film far exceeded all my expectations. The acting from all concerned was impeccable and the singing was emotional and very engaging. If Anne Hathaway does not pick up an Oscar for 'I dreamed a dream' alone, then I really don't know what is happening at the Academy. I had no complaints about the pacing or the screenplay. The barricade scenes were well executed and edited. Set design, costuming, lighting, all perfect, (although I did spot that the jar of eyeballs at the Thenardier tavern was written in English and not French! Ha!)Hugh Jackman carried this film with dignity and grace and hit most of the notes very well. Samantha Barks also excelled as did Anne Hathaway giving the performance of her career. Cohen and Carter were amusing as the (much-needed) comic relief.The songs were performed very well by all concerned, I found the revolutionary songs stirring and uplifting, and Cosette and Marius's duet heart-wrenching, knowing Eponyne was in the background. Very good.The final 90 seconds was staggering – the vision of how the June Rebellion should have ended, as it ended in Paradise. Just magnificent.Awards all round I hope – 10/10.",10,2,4,3 February 2013
Prometheus," A magnificent mess
","Ridley Scott's sci-fi CV is up with the best of them so I had high hopes for this prequel to the Alien franchise, (of which his film is by far and away the best). Oh dear, what a disappointment - a series of astonishing and fabulous special effects masterpieces were offset by an incoherent plot, weak acting and more plot holes than a Swiss cheese.On the negative side: I suppose it would appear picky to take the film apart too much and dive too deeply into the detail, it is only fiction after all and everyone watching it is supposed to be enjoying themselves! But I did find some things stretching credulity...a mission briefing given on arrival rather than on embarkation...no trained security taken on an expedition costing a trillion dollars intending to encounter aliens of unknown military potential...DIY abdominal surgery held together with paperclips and with the patient running full tilt within minutes...a race of super-intelligent creatures whose first reaction to a polite question is to pull the questioner's head off (perhaps it might have been an idea to subtitle David's question so we knew what he said?)...quarantine regulations enforced by open doors and flamethrowers...The list goes on.The plot offered no explanation (that I could see) as to why the Engineers wanted us dead, or why they brought life to the dead Earth in the first place. Where did the Captain get his reasoning from that LV223 was a military installation? What was the purpose of the giant head and the green stone? Why was no one left on the bridge to watch over Milburn and Fifield when they were lost within the dome structure? I don't know.On the positive side: It would be fair to say that the SFX were jaw-dropping. I thought the opening shots of the primeval Earth and of Prometheus's arrival at LV223 were breathtaking. I liked Fifield's map-making droids and the Galactic Map in the centre of the alien ship. The various grisly creatures featured were very well-conceived and the Engineers themselves were impressive.A pity that the best acting came from someone playing a synthetic human. Such a shame that the film left more questions than when it started, although at least we now know that the aliens of the franchise are biological weapons. I hope Dr Shaw's further adventures are more coherent.My son and I saw Dark Star on DVD the previous night. Frankly, we enjoyed that more.6/10.",Null,3,6,9 June 2012
Monsters University," Enjoyable prequel
","Here is a prequel to a hugely popular and enjoyable 2001 hit for Pixar that succeeds in developing the original's already highly likable characters. Don Scanlan has put together a satire on the American college system that contains very few surprises but manages to grasp the attention for 110 minutes with ease. Billy Crystal and John Goodman return to voice their old characters with relish, providing warmth and humour aplenty. Steve Buscemi's Randall is also there, sowing the seeds for his future bitterness.The movie tells the tale of Mike and Sully's early relationship from initial animosity to close friendship. There are a few twists and turns along the way, spanners thrown in the works by Frat House rivals and Helen Mirren's sinister Dean, but our heroes overcome all obstacles mainly due to Mike's unquenchable optimism and determination to succeed in his childhood ambition to become a scarer.Mike's main problem is that he just isn't scary. It was sad to see him come to this realisation despite his dedication and hard work, while Sully the natural born scarer struggles because of his reluctance to work at all. The main message of the film, therefore, I would say, is a simple 'Be Yourself' message – accept what you are and celebrate your strengths rather than your weaknesses. Pixar is triumphant at creating lovable characters that get the message across and this film is no exception.The film concludes beautifully, with Mike and Sully, and their unlikely friends in Oozma Kappa fraternity all ending up where they want to be. The CGI is gorgeous and the college is lovingly created with bright, sumptuous colours and a host of entertaining and likable support characters.Go and see this film – you won't be disappointed.9/10.",9,0,0,28 July 2013
Lucy," Not so dumb science, perhaps
","Writer/director Luc Besson serves up another entertaining ninety minutes of science fiction, this time based on the (erroneous) concept of the human brain using only a fraction of its capacity. (The brain does in fact use all its grey and white matter, just not all at once). Anyway, that's the dumb science part of it, and the idea does result in a thrill ride across the world as Scarlett Johansson's unwitting victim, the titular Lucy, becomes an emotionless death machine and the nemesis of those who engaged her in their nefarious activities.Lucy's emotional and mental transformation was as a result of the ingestion of some of the drug she was coerced into transporting. (A nice touch to use Julian Rhind-Tutt as the first surgeon – he played a surgeon in the UK TV series 'Green Wing.') Her mission as an avenging angel was satisfying (no-one likes bullies) as was her willingness to share her knowledge with the specialist she identified – Professor Norman, impeccably played as ever by the excellent Morgan Freeman. There was good support from Min-sik Choi as the Taiwanese mob leader and Amr Waked as the French police captain Lucy adopted as an ally.The film was heading to its logical conclusion when the science suddenly became a little more intriguing as the film postulated a redefinition of the laws governing all of existence, and not many Hollywood films do that nowadays!The ending has been done before (in Lawnmower Man), but not before the sum total of all knowledge was donated to Professor Norman by the transforming Lucy. This leaves the possibility for a sequel nicely poised. Will Lucy become a benevolent guardian, a curse on humanity, or a mere observer?I enjoyed this film. The mobsters were intimidating and convincing, the police were not made fools of, the leads were engaging and believable, the CGI not excessive. Stunts and action scenes were handled with skill. I enjoyed the cool and efficient airport arrests of the other drug mules – beautifully handled.There were some flaws, the one that jarred with me the most was the timing of moving so many drug suspects across Europe. I am not sure German, French and Italian law enforcement agencies co-operate quite so efficiently, but that would detract from the film's message. A good evening's entertainment and not the disaster many might have you believe – 9/10.",9,6,15,2 September 2014
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Not a bad film but be warned it is an Episode IV remake
","This is Disney's first venture into live action sci-fi since the risible Black Hole of 1979. Having made such a complete cow-pat of that movie, and having paid multi-billions for the Star Wars rights, it is understandable that Disney's execs wanted to play it safe this time, and play it safe they did. They hired a director with form for breathing new life into a tired old franchise and used the most successful and charismatic of the previous six movies as a frame on which to hang the same plot for the latest.Stop me if you have heard any of this beforeA droid containing information vital to the Resistance is hunted by the bad guys. Droid lands on desert planet and befriends a local scratching a living in the dust. Stormtroopers destroy village. Heroic female character is captured by the bad guys and is rescued by the good guys. Bad guys have a massive weapon that can destroy entire planets just like that. Bad guys destroy defenceless planet. Massive weapon has shields that are protected by an off-world shield generator which is destroyed by rebels. Massive weapon is destroyed by small scale fighters navigating down a tight trench under heavy fire.PS: Storm troopers STILL cannot hit a barn door from five yards.For crying out loud.OK – having said all that, there are several good points, the main one being the absence of Jar-Jar Binks or any such irritating CGI character. CGI was used more sparingly than the prequels, and practical effects are well-made and effective. The cinematography was astonishing, there were some quite beautiful scenes. I particularly liked the tie-fighters back-lit by a setting sun, and the shots of Greenham Common, (two miles from my home), with the old Cruise missile bunkers doubling as the Resistance HQ. (I even recognized some of the gorse bushes, lol).Good to see Mark Hamill again as well, although he looked half-dead. One hopes Episode VIII will have a little more originality than this one.A good evening's entertainment, but I doubt I'll see it again.",7,4,13,17 December 2015
Minions," Not great, but not bad
","Shrek's Puss in Boots, the Penguins of Madagascar, and the Minions of Despicable Me were all inevitably going to get the full feature length treatment. All three have proved to be a little disappointing, but Minions is the least disappointing of the three.It is the danger of sidekicks that they are perceived to be bigger than their parent movies. The Minions with their gabbly language and cheerful ineptitude, their ignorance of any sort of consequences of their actions and their irrepressible joie-de-vivre are hugely engaging and entertaining creatures. Do they have the capacity to carry a 90 minute movie – well yes, but only just.When I saw this there was only small child in the cinema (on a schoolday?) and she laughed loudly throughout the prologue but not once thereafter. There you have it in a nutshell! Perhaps she ought to write a review for IMDb. I found it amusing and interesting with its superb score and references to 60s culture. I thought the human voice overs were OK, with Jennifer Saunders and Sandra Bullock standing out, but the plot seemed a bit stretched in places, especially in London.The final link in the Minions' story when they made their last connection and found their ideal master was excellent and tied everything up neatly but I got the feeling that a lot of chances for Minion mayhem were missed. I did, however, laugh at the torture chamber scene – only the Minions could treat a medieval torture chamber like an adventure playground – brilliant.So yes, not the triumph it could have been but neither the disaster it could have been. 7/10.",7,9,16,2 July 2015
Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted," Superior sequel
","After reading glowing reviews of this latest instalment in the Madagascar franchise, and after hugely enjoying the previous two movies, my hopes were high for a similar helping of nonsensical mayhem and was not in the slightest bit disappointed.The familiar faces are all there once again, this time making a successful return to New York Zoo, and picking up a few new friends (and enemies) on the way. Alex and the bunch travel via a Monaco casino and then, pursued by Animal Control, hitch a ride with a failing circus to Rome and London to earn themselves a trip across the Atlantic, and home. Once there, they discover they have outgrown the Zoo which has become a prison for them. They are pursued all the way by a formidable French Animal Control officer, voiced by Frances McDormand, intent on completing her collection of wall trophies with Alex's head. Needless to say, she and her assistants get their just desserts, but I get the distinct feeling she will be back in the next sequel, angrier than ever.Alex and the gang get their fair share of screen time and wisecracks, with only King Julien sidelined a little. The monkeys and the penguins were as manic as ever, and Alex holds the group together nicely. The newcomers come in the form of a failing circus, and they present an entirely new group, the chief characters being Gia the trapeze jaguar who develops a crush on Alex, Vitaly a tiger suffering a crisis of confidence, and Stefano the sea-lion, wonderfully voiced by Martin Short. These three are as close as Alex and his friends are, but learn to like and then love their new companions as they overcome the various obstacles in their way. All the animals and the humans also, even the Italian policemen, are given time to endear and engage with the audience, and this is done seamlessly with great skill. I spotted nods to the Matrix, with the banana machine gun and Shawshank Redemption, with the wall poster, and there are probably a whole bundle more.I saw it in 3D and would recommend it – the animation is sumptuous and exhilarating. The characters are beautifully observed and well scripted. The humour is engaging with plenty for children and adults to enjoy.I liked the tour promoter the Circus had to impress in London. Alex spies for anyone looking like an American in the audience, well there's Uncle Sam himself with a bald eagle feeding him a piece of popcorn! Hmmm – rather obvious! Excellent!(I also particularly enjoyed the Circus's visit to Rome, having been there myself two years ago, and recognising not only the Vatican and the Colosseum, but also the police station in the city centre which was opposite the hotel we stayed in!)There is not much of a plot or a story to speak of, other than the journey itself being an excuse to hang set piece after set piece of massively excessive CGI which is highly entertaining. If there is a message it is about friendships forged in the face of adversity, all pulling together with their passion, enthusiasm and belief conquering all.The movie closes the return to New York, and ends with the whole gang steaming off on a Circus tour of the USA to continue the insanity. Ninety-three minutes passed like a snap of the fingers and I, for one, can't wait for the fourth movie.",10,1,2,4 November 2012
Spectre," Sumptuous and beautifully crafted action/thriller
","Here is another entry to the Bond franchise, again by Sam Mendes who brings stunning cinematography and editing to Daniel Craig's fourth outing as 007. This film carries on from Skyfall with a message from the grave by the former M to engage in some unofficial work in Mexico City which lands Bond in trouble with his superiors and does not help the new M's cause in fending off absorption of his department into another, more surveillance-minded department.Bond's adventures uncover the sinister organisation behind his previous three adversaries - Spectre - revived again with the superb Christophe Waltz as the underused Blofeld, who turns out to have a surprising former relationship with Bond.The film closes with Blofeld under arrest, (so one anticipates the next movie will begin with his break-out from jail), and the double-oh programme restored to its rightful role at the heart of Britain's covert operations - I love happy endings.On the way there is some superb photography, particularly the swooping opening shot in Mexico City with almost seamless editing; Mrs Sciarra's apartment in Rome; Rome itself, and Austria. There is the usual array of gadgets and gizmos, beautiful girls, loud explosions, gunfire and lots of irresponsible mayhem. Dave Bautista is impressive as a thoroughly unpleasant bad guy, short on words but long on cool menace and physicality. The train fight was particularly enjoyable, echoes of From Russia With Love here. Ben Whishaw was hilarious as Q, he is just perfect. Spectre also has a sense of humour with regular chuckles from the cinema audience.It would be a bit picky to be overly critical but I did think that we could have seen a bit more of Blofeld, even though I understand that limiting his appearances heightens his menace. I though Ralph Fiennes still seems a little lacking in passion as M - Judi Dench was barely in this but still contained more emotion than all of Fiennes' screen time. Monica Bellucci was also underused, I was looking forwards to much more from her - maybe she will return in the next film.These are minor criticisms - Spectre is two hours of rewarding and enjoyable madness which sits very well in the Bond franchise. Long may it continue.",9,1,4,6 December 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," Absolutely crackers!
","After a 30 year gap, George Miller at last returns to his road-warrior franchise set in a dystopian future, this time starring Tom Hardy in the title role. However, the film is misnamed – his partner in mayhem, Imperator Furiosa, superbly played by Charlize Theron, provides all the motivation and purpose for the (thin) plot and story. Max, unwillingly at first, is just along for the ride. The ride in question though, is a thrill-a-minute chase across arid desert and rocky canyons infested with all kinds of post-apocalyptic low-lifes intent on stopping or capturing Furiosa's fortified articulated lorry – the War-rig.Furiosa is a driver for the local warlord, a horrendous character named Immortan Joe who seems to have fathered an entire race of warriors and uses them, along with his control of the water supply, to enforce his will on the ragged and desperate population. Joe has five favourite concubines he uses as breeding stock and Furiosa's mission is for her to return to her childhood home and save Joe's women at the same time. Naturally, Joe is reluctant to part with his harem and so pursues his erstwhile employee which provides a frame on which to hang two hours of hugely enjoyable chaos which often makes little sense but never fails to entertain and amuse.Miller must have enjoyed the advent of CGI, it enables this film to be what the first three films never could be, although, to be fair, the CGI is used sparingly and heavy reliance is placed on daring and dangerous stunts. If there was an Oscar for stuntmen this film would be right up there! The cinematography is stupendous and set and costume design are sumptuous and convincing.This film may only attract technical awards by the Academy, but believe me it's an evening's entertainment not to be missed.The only real criticism I have is that the character of Max is not developed in any real way, save for the flashbacks he gets at critical and often inconvenient moments. Max has very little dialogue and very little emotional input to the film. Hardy does very well with what he was given but I hope that the next film has him open Max up a bit more in some ways.Welcome back Max! 9 out of 10.",9,5,13,28 May 2015
