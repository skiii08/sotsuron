First Man," 7.2/10
","I had high expectations for Gosling, and I must say he did deliver. I can appreciate the production quality, and also gives you a good perspective on what happened behind the scenes of the first Apollo mission to the moon. Not anywhere close to 'Interstellar', however that's not what it's trying to be or do.",7,0,0,27 July 2019
Avengers: Endgame," 9/10
","A great ending, to a much loved saga. It would have been very easy for Marvel to mess this one up, but it delivered in all aspects.",9,4,5,13 October 2019
Toy Story 4," 6.8/10
","A new twist on a modern classic, with a sprinkle of nostalgia along the way. The animation was second to none, however the storyline was average at best. Expect some good laughs, but poor character development along the way. Great for the family, but it seems to have lost its 'relatable for all ages' talent.",7,1,1,14 February 2020
Aladdin," 7.2/10
","The best Disney remake since Christopher Robin. Disney doesn't have a great reputation when it comes down to remakes, and although this one doesn't strictly stick to the original story line, there is no issue as the screenplay is great. Smith steals the show which should be no surprise, however he seems to finally have his mojo back after a drought of good films.",7,2,4,14 July 2019
The Lion King," 8.4/10
","For the past two years, Disney remakes have been somewhat of a stain or bad joke in the movie industry, however this film does not contribute to that pile. I think the perfect remake incorporates what we know and love from the original movie, but also ensures you don't leave the cinema feeling as though you've not experienced anything new. This film gave me that satisfaction. On top of this, there have been a lot of comments saying 'the CGI is too realistic, and therefore you can't see the emotion on the animals face'. I mean come on! If they gave animals eyebrows and facial expressions, everyone would be complaining that it's not realistic enough! That aside, I think they nailed the casting, especially Seth Rogan and Billy Eichner who steal the show. This is a visual masterpiece, which is the biggest leap forward since Avatar.",8,1,3,27 July 2019
Coco," 8/10
","Very well written and thought provoking. Brilliant for kids to grasp the concept of death, as well reminding adults what's important. In a world of heightened international tensions, Disney have not shied away from embracing Mexican culture.",8,0,0,9 August 2019
Midsommar," 7.7/10
","A creepy journey through the depths of your own thoughts and reality. Graphic themes of gore throughout, not for the light hearted. Not a film that will keep you up at night, however a good visual experience and original idea.",8,1,3,14 July 2019
Joker," 10/10 - A Masterpiece
","A breath of fresh air when it comes to a super hero film. No CGI crap, just a combination of a great script, and surely an oscar winning acting performance from Joaquin Phoenix. I don't think I've seen better character development in a film, which ironically I can only relate to the Joker performance from Heath Ledger some time ago. Despite the unapologetic violence, you somehow feel yourself rooting for the Joker. I read recently that in an interview, Joaquin was asked if he had studied previous Joker performances, to gain a good understanding of what was expected. However, he advised that he did no such thing, and took a completely fresh approach to the character to ensure success. Yes the Joker is meant to be creepy, evil or twisted. But for the first time we see emotion from the Joker - human emotion that as a viewer we can understand and relate to.I could go on and on.. but to conclude, this is the kind of film that only comes around every 5 years. A true masterpiece.",10,0,1,13 October 2019
It Chapter Two," 6.5/10
","After really enjoying the first film, we rushed to the cinema with anticipation for another tense rollercoaster of emotions. This unfortunately failed to deliver this, and was more of a Disney thriller than a horror movie. The film is also ridiculously long, which wouldn't normally bother me if the film warranted it, but I felt there were a lot of scenes which could have easily have been cut out without missing any of the plot out.The CGI was also very poor. That kind of CGI which looks obviously fake and wishy washy. It would have been much more scarier if they had a person in a clown suit chasing people around, rather than an animated version.",6,0,0,7 October 2019
