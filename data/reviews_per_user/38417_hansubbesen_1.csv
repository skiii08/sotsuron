It," Confusing, yet rewarding
","Let me get straight to it. This film is NOT about IT or any kind technology. That was a huge letdown. With that out of the way, let me say that this here movie made me soil myself. A total win. Normallywhen i watch a horror film, i expect to be scared and therefore is not. Here i was vulnerable as the kid in the start of the movie. Also the people that sat next to me left because of the smell, so I had more space to myself. 8/10",8,2,8,11 September 2017
