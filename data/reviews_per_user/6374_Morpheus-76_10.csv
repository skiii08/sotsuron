The Blair Witch Project," This will haunt you for days...
","I´ve seen this movie dubbed 'the scariest movie of the 90´s', and I must say they´re wrong. This is THE scariest movie of them ALL! It starts slowly and thus fooling you to think it´s not so scary after all. Gradually it becomes more and more horrifying until you just can´t take it anymore! By the time the final shot comes and the movie releases you from it´s grasp you´re left with heart pounding, shocked to your core. The final shot keeps returning to your mind for days. It´s amazing how something so simple can be so overwhelmingly terrifying... How have they managed to come up with a movie this good with almost non-existent budget, unknown actors and simple script? The answer lies in many things, but most importantly in the actors and the style this movie was made. Together they create an experience which is totally convincing. Always before you could see the actors are faking it all and this and that was made by effects, film-editing etc. The documentary style guarantees the situations are portrayed realistically and all three actors seem like they aren´t acting at all, just as if they were really living it all. I would like to recommend an oscar for everybody responsible for this movie, it´s really that good and groundbreaking.",10,1,2,22 November 1999
X-Men," x-cellent!
","I was expecting much from this film and (surprisingly) I wasn´t disappointed. Most comic book-based films are badly made and just plain silly, but this one was an exception (like Batman 1&2). Director Bryan Singer has made a serious film, with only a few light gags -which all fit perfectly into the film. The story centers around Wolverine and Roque, who both are introduced as newcomers to rest of the group. The big story is about stopping Magneto´s plans, but it´s somehow of lesser importance than the relationship between Wolverine and Rogue, which doesn´t bother me at all. This is an action movie but the talky parts are better than the action -something that is very rare in a blockbuster!- and I think it´s all the better a movie for it. The acting is great: Hugh Jackman IS Wolverine, he´s a marvel to behold; Anna Paquin is great as the tragic Rogue; Patrick and McKellen are great as usual and the rest of the cast looks great (especially the ladies...) but have little to do. This is certainly a beginning for a saga and it doesn´t bother me, because in the long run, I´m sure it will work nicely with its sequels. A great, original film. Go see it!",9,0,0,5 September 2000
The Terminator," The most relentless film ever made!
","This marked as Arnold´s and Cameron´s rise to stardom and was also a landmark in action and sci-fi films. Although the Terminator had a small budget, it´s still visually perfect and captivating. As for the acting, Arnold does what he does best and he does it well (he´s very convincing as a cyborg) although many would claim it´s not acting...  But the best thing about this film is it´s relentlessness; it´s totally merciless and humourless as it drives towards one of the best end-fights ever made. Music serves an important part in convincing the viewer of the sheer unstoppable evil of the Terminator who never rests. A total masterpiece which endures repeat viewings from year to year!",10,0,0,31 October 1999
Predator," Action-horror masterpiece!
","The Predator is in my opinion one of the most under-rated movies man has made. It´s full of undying lines and genious storytelling considering the plot which is very simple to be honest. But that´s the genious of the Predator; it starts as a straight-forward actionfest, but then turns into a horror movie of immensely atmospheric proportions. Visually it´s gripping and has some clever use of cameratricks and special effects. Music is also very atmospheric. It also has a great (if a bit too 'superhero') ending, which is rare these days. Shame about the sequel...",10,1,2,31 October 1999
Aliens," There is and never will be a better film! This is IT!
","Aliens is my favourite film of all time. It´s perfect as a diamond, every single second is pure perfection, there´s nothing left to improve. The actors are all top-notch, everyone´s a character for whom you care, only to see them die. The effects are incredible, the aliens themselves are true horror. And music! Well, this is the best music ever made for film! The APC-rescue scene music gives me goosebumps every time I see it (and I´ve seen it MANY times)! The action is relentless once it starts, and the atmosphere is so thick you could cut it! And finally, Sigourney, she´s totally awesome, an ACTOR! She commands more respect than the rest of the marines combined. This film will give nightmares but its all worth it, because this is simply the best movie ever made, and I know it because it has survived the test of time without a scratch.",10,1,2,31 October 1999
2001: A Space Odyssey," The most over-rated SF film!
","I´ve seen this a couple of times. The first time I fell asleep from sheer boredom. This was many years ago, so I thought maybe I was too young (or tired) to 'get' it. I saw it again. It was even more boring than I remembered! It´s OK to be artistic, but when a spaceship docks for 10 minutes to the tune of classical music, it just doesn´t work anymore. 2001 has some redeeming qualities, mostly in the whole 'HAL'-concept and sometimes the slow, artistic approach works, but they can´t save this film from dullness. Sorry.",2,5,15,31 October 1999
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Good, but not great
","Harry Potter see´ms to have all the ingredients to make a great movie (good actors, great original story, big budget, John Williams -sound track) but somehow it fails to really amaze, thrill or laugh. I haven´t read the book, but I still got the feeling that a lot of good material had been hacked of; everything went by too fast and the film concentrated on nothing for long enough to make an emotional impact. This may be partially due to the bad director (Columbus) whose style is devoid of feeling or flare. All the actors are great, which is quite an achievement considering there is not only one childstar, but three! Anyway, it´s good but not great. I think I´ll read the books now. And wait for Lord of the Rings.",8,0,0,3 December 2001
The Shawshank Redemption," Probably the best 'surprisingly good' film I´ve seen!
","I didn´t expect much from this film before I saw it. It had OK stars, the plot sounded pretty familiar and it was originally a Stephen King story. Once I started watching it I thought: 'Hey! This is pretty good!'. And it got better as it went along. The story was was a perfect mix of high drama and 'feelgood' quality. It didn´t matter it was long and the story went along slowly. It was all build-up for the amazing ending which caught me by surprise. Somehow the film has a sense of being more than it seems at first, it´s really an epic story of one man´s determination against the system (or even his given destiny!). If you´ve never seen this film, go see it -you won´t be disappointed!",9,0,0,31 October 1999
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The purest manifestation of imagination on film
","Everybody has seen this film and for a good reason: this is what movies should be like, entertaining. And what´s best about Star Wars is the sheer amount of imagination put into it. There´s a whole universe full of alien creatures, fantastic machines and old religions. There´s never been and probably never will be a purer manifestation of imagination on film. It might not be perfect, but it´s unique and certainly the most influential film ever made. You just have to respect Lucas for coming up with this kind of film which has captured the interest of moviegoers worldwide from its release to date, never failing to amaze despite its age. A true classic.",9,0,0,31 October 1999
Braveheart," The best 3 hours of film!
","Ah, where should I begin? The brutal fight sequences? Or the great visuals? Or maybe Mel´s totally convincing acting? Well, It really doesn´t matter since this film keeps you hooked for its (considerably long) running time. I´ve always thought Mel Gibson is excellent in portraying extreme emotions, but this tops all his previous acts. Never has movie violence been more brutal, yet necessary for the story. Braveheart contains two best movie-moments ever made, [Warning! Small SPOILER ahead!!!] namely the 'revenge'-scene and the ending. All I can say is...    Freedom!!!",10,2,4,31 October 1999
