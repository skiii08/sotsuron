United 93," Excellent objective documentary!
","I was extremely impressed with the objectivity of this documentary, given how strongly this day is burned into our collective conscience. This movie had absolutely no political, religious, or racial biases of any kind - just presenting the story as it unfolded in real time in a very realistic and believable manner. While watching this, I felt like I was reliving the day.The actors are all 'no names' - just real people like you and I. The behavior of the character is also very believable. I could picture myself on that flight. Although what exactly happened on flight 93 will never be known, this documentary gives a very plausible scenario given the facts that are known. Extremely well done! I recommend it to anyone.",10,3,6,29 April 2006
