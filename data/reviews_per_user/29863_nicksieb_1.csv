The Ring," the best thriller ever!!!
","It was just a year ago when my eye caught a DVD called ''The ring'' in a Videoclub. I had heard a few things about it but I didn't think that it would be such a big deal. However, I decided to borrow and watch it. I was totally astonished. From the very beginning to the end credits I remained absorbed in the magic of this movie. Even though the plot is a bit complicated, it is imaginative and totally innovative that it can lure even the most demanding spectators. According to it, there is a videotape which if someone watches, he dies after seven days. Yeah, it may be unrealistic but very challenging as well. Isn't it? Furthermore, the direction was great.Gore Verbinski, the charismatic director of ''The ring'' managed successfully to create a gloomy atmosphere where horror and mystery are harmoniously combined. This whole situation provokes to the spectator a weird feeling of anxiety and fear for what is going to happen in the movie.Undoubtedly, the outstanding performance of Naomi Watts, who proved for one more time how talented she is, has a great impact on them too.In many cases, the spectator puts himself into her place and tries to answer the questions about the cursed videotape. The whole movie is a quest for the truth, an attempt to survive from the evil that seems to live in the tape. One of the best thriller ever, equal to the ''Silence of lambs'', with Jodie Foster, and ''Seven'', with Brad Pitt. Don't miss it!",10,0,2,12 September 2005
