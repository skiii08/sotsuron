Marie Antoinette," Complete vanity project
","For me, movies, plays, shows must have a point to the story. Even if it's chronicling someone's life, there still must be a point, after all resources are going into this. My time I'd hoing into watching this. What doesn't have a point is. 2hr movie story telling of someone who only played and partied most of their adult life. Even if that someone is a queen. Ridiculous. The part that actually had purpose (about the French Revolution) was a short 10min. Most of that 10min were waiting scenes where nothing was actually happening, such as the king and queen sitting at a table for over 20 secs of us watching some people sent on a mission riding their horses out of the palace grounds another 20 secs. I think we get the point in the first 3 seconds and certainly be the 5th second. The movie was chock full of these 'waiyinv' Scenes, where you're just waiting for something to happen or the next scene and it doesn't come...until 20 secs later. This make vie should've been 1hr 14 min at most. First you tell quite the most insignificant story then you padded it with waiting scenes. Sure that's how you make a winning movie. Only glory was Kirsten Dunst's performance.",3,2,2,25 August 2018
