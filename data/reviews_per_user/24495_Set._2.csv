Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I crawled, I walked, I sat and watched Star Wars.
","This is one of the most gratifying movies i have seen in some many years. I was really caught off guard by the level of artistic talent that Lucas put forth in this movie, there was so many layers, that it is one of the few movies that have that 'replay' and very thought through structure. It would be more than easy to base a college course on the study of this film, AK would be proud.",10,0,1,19 May 1999
Hellboy," Hellboy stinks.
","Hellboy stinks.Which inspired me to rent El Espinazo del diablo (The Devil's Backbone), directed by Guillermo del Toro as well.The Devil's Backbone stinks.And, Guillermo del Toro is in talks to do sequels as well.Where all this stinks come from?
I have an idea: Both films are competent at best, but they lack in inspiration and motivation. The visuals are crisp, ut give nothing to the story or content; the weakest point being the editing and storytelling..
Hellboy's one-liners are constantly before a break in the scene, and there are no long takes. Drastic changes to the source make it 'sort-of' good to the general public, instead of great to one or the other (sources say the creator of Hellboy approves of the changes, I think it's a lie). There is Constant dialog throughout the movie, and no progressive narration from Hellboy which ends the expressionistic/comedic overtones we have enjoyed in the books. And, despite the visuals looking crisp they are only competent to the look in the novels (the look is possible). I say it's not dark or has enough contrast.. But that would make it stand out, which nothing does here.Comparatively, The D. Backbone always qued sound effects right before Santi enters, providing a much need obviousness to a scene we will be shown over, and over again without any furthering of the plot. The film could have been cut by 40 minutes. R-E-D-U-N-D-A-N-TIt's possible that del Toro was limited in his expression by his producers, but somehow I seriously doubt it, it's the storyteller.",Null,0,2,6 May 2004
