Casablanca," The reason to check out the classics.
","I thought Casablanca was going to be one of those over-hyped classics that's boring to watch. I couldn't be more wrong. The first thing that grabbed me was Humphrey Bogart. He did an excellent job portraying his character rick. Rick was a smooth, calm, collect kinda guy which set the mood. All of the actors/actresses contributed some very good acting too. The lighting was top notch and the music will stick in your head. The story which took place in the ww2 era, was very exciting to follow and did not let up once in grabbing your attention. The movie was full of dialog that I've heard in other films and TV shows but never knew it until I watched it. I recommend this movie to just about anyone with a heart and half a brain. So heres looking at you Casablanca.",9,1,2,1 September 2005
