Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," SO FUnny I Cried!!
",this is one of the funniest movies i have seen in a long time. although it starts of kind of slow. it is good to no that pointless humor still as such a strong effect!! I have been watching the Ali G show off and on for a while now and his character on there was always funny. This movie is a most see. it exposes the truth behind American people and the different cultures throughout the united states. I was surprise to see that there was an actual story behind it all. i was a little disappointed when i found out the hooker was an actual actress. Over all very very funny. enjoyed the majority of the movie! i laughed almost the entire time!,10,1,12,12 December 2006
