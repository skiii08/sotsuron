Requiem for a Dream," Updated Version of Days of Wine and Roses
","In Brighton Beach, Brooklyn Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn), her son Harry (Jared Leto) and his girlfriend Marion Sliver (Jennifer Connelly) all dream of better days to come, but as in the 1962 film, 'Days of Wine and Roses,' that is not to be.Instead of a husband and wife's decent into oblivion, it is a Mother, her son and his girlfriend. This is an intimate look into the decline and the inability to change ones' circumstances and how easily and quickly it all happens.You will long remember this film, but I wouldn't suggest watching it if you're in a downward spiral of any kind.",8,0,0,19 September 2017

"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Deep, Dark and Disturbing
","Frances McDormand (Mildred Hayes) and Sam Rockwell (Jason Dixon) both won Academy Awards for their roles. The film also recieved awards from the Golden Globe, BAFTA, and SAG. The film depicts the the agonizing grief of a mother who's child was murdered, the small town it takes place in, and the bizarre ways people react to fear, failure and frustration. While watching this film I couldn't help but be reminded of McDormand's role in Fargo, a matter of fact woman with a mission. Rockwell plays the type of cop we all know exists, but hope we never have to encounter. Together they appear to be on opposite ends of the law, but as the story unfolds they have more in common then they thought they could.This film is not for young viewers due to the violence, language, and subject matter. Good film for a rainy, Saturday afternoon with a hot toddy.",7,0,0,7 August 2018

La La Land," It Ain't Funny Girl
","I'm not a fan of musicals, but with all the rave reviews I thought I should at least watch it before turning my nose up. I guess you have to be a fan of musicals or a fan of one of the actors, I was neither. Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) is a piano jazz player insisting on playing only pure jazz but finds the lure of the dollar to hard to resist. Mia (Emma Stone) is a struggling actress working as a barista in between auditions. They fall in love just as their careers take unexpected turns. As for me, it took to long to get into the story, but it did keep me intrigued as to where would Sebastian and Mia's careers take them? Would they stay together? Would they break up and then get back together? Good movie for the teen girl sleepover.",7,2,3,30 September 2017
