The Avengers," What's great and not so great about Marvel's The Avengers
","Yes, its a superhero (super cast) marathon, insane CGI and production values at its best, blah, blah, blah. Everyone knows that, what people don't know is why Avengers will work for most and not for a few.i believe the real heroes of this movie are two guys Joss Wheton (Director/Writer/Screenplay Writer) Seamus McGarvey (Cinematographer) I have observed the movies which really work as an integrated unit are the ones where the director himself does the screenplay. As a film student myself i can safely say that no matter how hard you try if the director and screenplay writers have two different work spaces (unless they are people who get along on a very personal level) they would never get it rolling on film. That's why people like Christopher Nolan/Peter Jackson take their movies into outer space. OK, Enough crap. What's bad?The fact that its another superhero bang bang movie with the typical marvel unrealistic (non human) plots. The story moves in a predictable direction and the thrills were expected (only well presented). The fact that there's currently no Spiderman/Xmen in Marvel's 'Avengers' scheme of things will disappoint a few fans (Although Marvel Studios are onto Sony Columbia and Fox to get individual character rights for sequels). So surely a group of people will find it ordinary or not worth their time.What's good?You will run out of answers when you think of could this movie with this plot have been made any better at all? All the fan favorite marvel characters in the film are given as much character development and depth as a 142 min film could've allowed while at the same time make sure the visuals make it into the trailers and get audiences rolling in. The cinematography is fantastic for example there a couple of scenes where we (camera) are in the car and we see ourselves rolling! and the action scenes are done so that you can register/admire them properly (Michael Bay should have a look into this!). Joss Wheton is top class all through. Classic big screen adventure!For the majority of the fans. You will clap, cheer, hoot at Robert Downey Jr's quirks, Dr. Banner/Hulk's smash comedy and will admire Chris Evans commands as Captain America, Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye and Chris Hemsworth as Thor. The visuals are fantastic, the plot is entertaining all through. 3D is an added feature which i personally enjoyed tremendously. If you have a group of friends to go with, this movie will surely make your weekend!",10,3,8,28 April 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," If you've ever laughed or cried or cheered at any projected moving image, you cannot afford to miss this trilogy
","The Batman is a worshiped character throughout the world of movie goers as well as comic book fans specially after 'The Dark Knight' where the makers achieved the impossible and made you question your ways of thought about the day to day world. The more you plan and scheme, the more things can go NOT according to plan, rather why not embrace chaos? The world isn't fair so why follow moral codes and ethics? Why make friends and why follow the rules set out by someone else? Only a movie like The Dark Knight could have made anyone feel like that.Christopher Nolan studied literature in college for a reason and that reason is apparent in his films. He brings a sense of great storytelling with the massive scale and canvas for his audiences. He doesn't make movies just for intelligent and spectacular entertainment but forces the viewer to think a lot after one has witnessed his product. He makes the hero more human than anyone else can and tells you how everyone can be a hero in their own universe.The Dark Knight Rises hovers a lot lower than The Dark Knight simply because it is more of the same. It feels more of a sequel to 'Batman Begins' than anything else. It doesn't blow your mind off. It doesn't show or give you a feeling that you've never had before because the theme of the film revolves around fear and disparity, lies and betrayals and how you choose to rise above that. However it treats the fictional characters as best as possible. There are fantastic elements for the promised epic conclusion but somewhere it lacks a little bit in the tight and nerve jangling screenplays we are used to from the Nolan Brothers. There is a release of pressure in places at times so the audience gets at the edge of the seat then slides back and then comes back up. This one ties all loose ends, the story comes full circle with a promise and hope for a better future without which peace cannot be sustained. The legend ends in style nevertheless.You do tend to expect more from the man who gave us the Joker's epic lines, which is unfair. In its own right, The Dark Knight Rises Rose well above most films of the Action/Adventure/Crime genre.These films are beyond actors, beyond technicalities, beyond film makers themselves. If you've ever laughed or cried or cheered at any projected moving image, you cannot afford to miss this trilogy.",8,5,8,21 July 2012
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Disappointing on so many levels.
","Of course I went into the movie with super high expectations. It was promised to be and was marketed as a duel between two of the most iconic superheroes ever. Many have waited decades to see this on the big screen.We happen to see a opening credits sequence which is rare in Hollywood nowadays and immediately it felt that this movie was trying to be different with Ben Affleck aka Bruce Wayne voicing over his ideology and trying to set up a new Batman.Have we seen the origin of Batman in recent times? Yes. Was this take cool anyway? Sure, with the typical Zack Synder slow motion and CGI. But the problem is what do we see in this world of Gotham, apart from an assumed history of Batman and some interactions with the new butler?  Nothing! Fine we know they're going to do a solo Batman movie but god knows where that'll go and in what timeline that'll be based in.Now over to Superman. Clarke Kent is living in an apartment in the city of Metropolis with his love Lois Lane, saving lives (Shown almost entirely in the trailers) and trying to put a story of the Bat-Vigilante in the Daily Planet even when his boss Perry White now suddenly crops up silly headlines like J Jonah Jameson from Spiderman 2. What surprised me was that no one noticed Lois kissing Superman later in the film in front of a taxi when she's thrown off a building by Lex Luthor. Especially since the film's plot at least in the first half revolves around who this alien is and what does he truly want?Speaking of Lex Luthor, unlike many critics, I didn't dislike this take on this maniacal super rich flipped out kid who wants to seize the opportunity of being able to develop a weapon to control the god-like alien in town. I don't mind it being different from the traditional take of Lex Luthor. I thought he was crazy enough. Then there's Wonder Woman. I thought she was hot. For me there was nothing else to her character so I 'wonder' why show her like this? She even mentioned at the very end that she's been away from humanity since the last 100 years but why return now? Where was she when General Zod and Superman destroyed almost all of Metropolis in Man of Steel? The destruction and the threat then was clearly more than what happened in this movie.There was no agenda to her character other than the fact that they're doing Justice League down the road. Alas. Also to be honest the blockbuster fight that they build to in the first half fails to deliver. It's too short and most of the visual punch lines were given away in the trailers. This comes of course from the flack Man of Steel got for its overuse of action and destruction. I love Man of Steel by the way. That film for me is much more focused than this monstrosity. Doomsday? No. Had no character apart from menacing growls. And when the super team teams up they had to fight something. We all knew that as well from the trailers. Alas.Ultimately for me the film was neither a satisfying Batman story, nor a Superman story, nor a Justice League story while it tried to be all three. We all know the problems. Marvel is killing it in the eyes of many in Hollywood and DC is playing catch up. Yes Zack Synder is not Christopher Nolan but he's not a bad director. He's a style over substance type director, yes. But the problem comes when an iconic match up like this fails to deliver on a psychological and philosophical level. I don't seem to recollect any quotes (apart from the ones in the trailers) as well that makes me think this movie will grow on me. Yes the visuals are good but not memorable.Maybe the upcoming R-rated Ultimate Cut on home video which is 30 minutes longer will help.Should we be afraid of the Justice League movie directed by Zack Synder? Yes.",5,1,5,26 March 2016
