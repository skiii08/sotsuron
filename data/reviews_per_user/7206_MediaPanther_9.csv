The Equalizer," Washington nails it
","Antoine Fuqua's big screen adaptation of the 80â€²s TV series The Equalizer opens with an impressive tracking shot through an open window, and into the orderly and near empty apartment, belonging to Robert McCall (Denzel Washington). McCall lives a Spartan existence; for the first twenty minutes of the picture, he hardly says a word. Fuqua (Training Day) gives a lengthy shot as you watch McCall fold something delicately into a napkin. When you see him unfold the napkin at his regular diner, and place the teabag into a cup of hot water, you understand immediately that this man is a creature of habit, firmly set in his ways. Every night he's there, reading a book. He's such a regular, that he strikes up a familiar acquaintance in a young teenage prostitute, Teri (Chloe Grace Moretz)), which eventually grows into something of a friendship. There is something undeniably hidden within him, however. When he realizes the danger Teri is in thanks to her nefarious Russian pimps, he forgoes his cautious life, and willingly brings on the pain.Director Fuqua accordingly really brings on the style for these sequences. His relative quiet touches give way to mayhem. Before every murder McCall commits, the camera slows down, taking on a golden hue, and you literally see McCall breaking down every element of his victims: tattoos, facial expressions. And then he lets loose: even timing himself to see if he can voice dispatch Mafiosi in 30 seconds or less.And The Equalizer is undeniably fun. It's one of those thrillers that begins moody and atmospheric, and then decides it would be more fun to see how many people can be dispatched with nail guns or corkscrew openers; and it is similarly unconcerned with logic in the idea that McCall decides to take down the entire East Coast hub of the Russian mafia, simply over one teenage prostitute. But with Fuqua this stylistically assured, and Washington equally game, does it really matter?As Teri, Chloe Grace Moretz (Kick Ass, Carrie) forgoes the sarcastic strategy Jodie Foster used as a teenage hooker in Scorsese's Taxi Driver. Teri is arguably much more frightened of her violent handlers, and is less given to false bravado as result. And even though her character really amounts to little more than a glorified supporting part after she is sent away, she is a great deal of fun to watch, and she holds her own more than capably against Denzel Washington (The Book Of Eli). The habit of extended cameos in The Equalizer is even more extreme in the case of Melissa Leo as Robert's former CIA contact, who pops up to give a vital piece of information on the evil mobster, and to tentatively tiptoe around the subject of his wife, while offering a small measure of comfort. The bit part parade reaches 'blink-and-you-miss him' cameo status, by casting a reputable star like Bill Pullman as Leo's husband, and giving him no more than four lines (though of course it's possible that this may be a larger part that met with cuts in the editing room).If anything, a weakness of The Equalizer is that McCall's troubled personal life is left as somewhat ambiguous. Who can blame it really? The opening aims for a quiet kind of profundity, and it succeeds, but isn't really interested in following through. For all its thin characterization, there is something just as nice in watching Denzel Washington coldly and calculatingly firing a nail gun in righteous vengeance.<ul><li>See more at: www.mediumraretv.org</li></ul>",8,126,199,26 September 2014
Creed," A Potential Classic
","If you have watched the original Rocky and think it is a near classic, then Creed is close. Maybe not a classic, because only time will tell. But it is close in terms of look and feel. There are scenes, tempo, performances, music, and of course the setting (Philadelphia) which harken back to the award winning 1976 film. This is not a comparison piece, but Creed is what the earlier release this year of Southpaw could have been; a gritty, modern day boxing film.Michael B. Jordan (Fruitvale Station), plays the titular character (using the name Donnie Johnson) who yearns to exorcise his demons/ follow his dreams in the boxing ring. Without giving anything away, he's the son of the late, great Apollo Creed and he sets out to find any trainer willing to take him on. He can fight, but he's raw and needs refinement if he's going to be taken seriously.His search lands him in his father's old Philly stomping ground, where he pester's one Rocky Balboa (Stallone) into training him. He pulls every angle to get Rocky to help him since his pop and Rocky were combatants and close friends before he died. Once Rocky begrudgingly gives in, things begin to coalesce. Stallone is excellent as the 'Mickey'-esque Balboa. Although he didn't write the screenplay for Creed, he is one of the producers and his presence is felt. The dynamic between his character and Creed is perfect. The right combination of old school and new school. One scene is indicative when Creed takes a picture on his phone of Rocky's workout routine then tells him it's 'in the cloud' to Rocky's bewilderment.In Creed, director and writer Ryan Cogler is reunited with Jordan. As Creed, Jordan's performance is on part with Stallone's. He imbues his character with just the right amount of bravado, not cockiness, just confidence, hunger, and drive. He also trained and bulked up for the role. But he's not all fierce competitor, he has funny, sensitive sides as well. Cogler's team decided Creed should have a love interest. The relationship he forges with a local neo- soul artist played by Tessa Thompson (Dear White People) could have been syrupy, but thankfully it doesn't overshadow the main theme or feel forced. Frankly, some of the scenes with Thompson and Jordan are very good and so is their chemistry.Creed is an excellent example of mixing newcomers with established names on both sides of the camera and having the end result come out perfect. The crew and cast turn in great work. Cogler had the fortune and skill to work with people who know what it takes to put together a film that would appeal to critics and audiences alike. There were a couple scenes that are 'wow' moments, not just fight scenes, which are are amazing, but little scenes that are set up, shot (by Maryse Alberti) and acted that will have a lasting effect on the viewer. Maybe classic isn't a stretch.<ul><li>See more at: http://www.mediumraretv.org/review/creed/#sthash.l3vjP0Ca.dpuf</li></ul>",Null,36,75,25 November 2015
Southpaw," Could Have Been A Contender
","Southpaw comes at you from many directions, but does it connect? That's what Antoine Fuqua (Training Day, Olympus Has Fallen) and crew are pinning their housenotes on in their take on the world of boxing.Jake Gyllenhaal plays an amped up throwback of both the boxing and human variety and puts in an excellent portrayal. Billy Hope (Gyllenhaal) is the light-heavyweight world champ with a great wife and cute little daughter to support him. The only problem is he might be getting a bit too mature for taking on shots to the dome and should stop. Unfortunately he doesn't want to.Fans of the 'sweet science' on film will certainly like the look and feel of Southpaw. Colors are crisp, camera angles, edits, choreography and cinematography especially during the fight segments are well above average. Besides these aspects, film fans in general might like other components of the film from set and costume design (except maybe Curtis Jackson's character), to the music and acting. If you don't like realistic boxing sequences, then close your eyes for the fight scenes. No to worry, there are some performances worth watching outside of the ring.As Billy's business savvy wife, Rachel McAdams should have been included more. Maureen is sassy, sexy, smart and cares deeply about her family. McAdams looks and acts the part without a hitch, but the plot goes in a different direction. About two thirds into Southpaw, Billy goes under the tutelage of Tick Willis (Forest Whitaker) to take on bouts for money and for a job. Whitaker is great as (of course) a gruff, world weary gym owner, mentor, trainer. The interplay between Tick and Billy are one of the saving graces of Southpaw. Thanks to Kurt Sutter, these characters get off some of the films best dialog and one liners. Billy showing up at one of Tick's haunts and the responses during his outbursts are prime examples.As briefly mentioned Gyllenhall is amazing in Southpaw. If you hear comparisons to De Niro or Stallone, that may be about right. Billy is the guy you want to root for. You feel for him in more ways than one, one of which is probably because he's a little off. The guy mumbles and your not sure if he's punch drunk and then you realize that he's not sure either. Besides his almost incomprehensible speech, he's wound tight. At one moment an almost homicidal maniac, then training kids how to move their feet in the ring. From his posture, speech, mannerisms, to throwing a punch, Gyllenhaal did his homework.Still there are perhaps glaring deficiencies in Southpaw. There is something that doesn't seem authentic. Most disconcerting would be the lack of medical professionals surrounding Billy Hope's world and boxing in general. Every time there's a shot of him in the locker room after a fight, there are no doctors to be found. The guy takes on a beating, blood coming out of his mouth, eye swollen shut, but nobody taking a look at him? Not to mention doing a scan every once in a while to make sure his brain hasn't turned to oatmeal. Would it have put the film over budget to cast a doctor or two? There are no weigh ins, only one press conference where there should be one before every fight, if not to make it more entertaining between combatants. The verbal fight before the actual fight. Then there's the issue of his little girl (nice job by Oona Laurence) at home by herself. They show her with someone who may be a nanny one time, other than that she is alone in the family's huge mansion for stretches of the film. She even rides in a limousine by herself after a funeral while her dad sits on a hill. No follow up on the murder of a key player? Nitpicking? Maybe, but these and other omissions detract from vaulting Southpaw to the next level.If you are able not to scrutinize Southpaw too much, it is a very good film. Gyllenhaal's whirling dervish performance will cover up a lot of the missteps. Unfortunately, the filmmakers failed to focus on other aspects that could have put it along some of the greats of the genre.<ul><li>See more at: http://www.mediumraretv.org/review/southpaw/#sthash.J0U0ov3U.dpuf</li></ul>",6,2,5,24 July 2015
The Lego Movie," A Killer Sense Of Humor
","Boasting a killer sense of humor and a surprising amount of heart, The Lego Movie is a film that is not just made for kids. It's made with the those small, colored building blocks in mind, easily bringing memories to life for the adult who played with Legos growing up.It's the underdog tale of Emit Brickowski (Chris Pratt), a standard mini-figure construction worker. Emit, like everyone in his city, lives his life based on instructions drawn up by Lord Business's (Will Ferrell) all encompassing corporation in the sky. When it's discovered that Emit is a prophesied savior of the world, called 'The Special,' he must prepare to become a 'Master Builder' to defeat Lord Business before he freezes the whole world. Along the way, Emit gets help from a tough as nails female mini figure, WyldStyle (Elizabeth Banks), a wise but blind wizard named Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman), and Batman (Will Arnett), along with scores of other familiar characters and faces.The film has a super fast pace, with many layers of humor that will keep you laughing and engaged the whole time. Pratt (Her) breathes life into Emit as a manic 'Everyman' character that you root for, as well as relate to. Arnett's Batman is an uber Alfa male, and every line he utters is quotable and hilarious. As the villain, Ferrell is fun, and with a surprising twist in the story, his performance becomes the heart and soul of the film.Unfortunately, there's a lack of female influences in the characters of The Lego Movie. Banks (The Hunger Games: Catching Fire) does a fine job bringing WyldStyle to life, and she represents everything a strong independent woman should be. Alison Brie (Community) plays a My Little Pony hybrid creature named Unikitty who is sugar and spice and everything nice, but she does not truly represent another female character, as ultimately she is more of an abstract idea of a character. There are a few brief moments with Wonder Woman (Cobie Smulders), however she is overshadowed by the machismo and gruff of Batman. It would have been lovely to see Wonder Woman work side by side with the male heroes to save the world, but she is regulated to cameo status.A combination of stop motion and CGI animation, the film is visually brilliant. The detail that has been taken to create this universe is astounding. You watch as entire worlds are destroyed in a flash with red, orange, and white Lego brick flames, only to see them built up again. The film is worth the 3D ticket as it enhances the experience and gives the visuals more depth.The Lego Movie is a pure delight. It's everything a humorous movie should be- visual, funny, and touching. It's been made for all audiences to enjoy. Bring the kids,but don't be surprised if you end up loving it more.-stina@mediumraretv.org www.mediumraretv.org",Null,25,51,6 February 2014
Mama," Interesting angle, still scary.
","When sisters Lily and Victoria are left in the woods after a series of horrific events leaves them orphaned, how would they survive for the next five years until they are eventually rescued? Have no fear, Mama is here. The debut feature from Spanish director Andres Muschietti has some plot hole, but still delivers the goods in a scary, almost poignant way.In Mama, there are similarities to the American version of The Ring in the way some of the scenes are shot in that grainy, static, antiquated, black and white style. Horror/ghost film fans might think parts of the film are clichÃ©d and they would be correct. However, the two sisters in the film (played by Megan Charpentier and Isabelle Nelisse) make for interesting viewing. As Victoria and Lilly, the two are feral creatures having lived in the wild the bulk of their lives. Even after being taken in by their uncle (Game Of Thrones' Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, Lilly still prefers to run around on all fours, eat with her hands while on the floor, and sleep under her bed. Her speech is relegated to growls and grunts with a few words mixed in. Her big sister, Victoria has a faster time assimilating to the civilized world. She even begins to cozy up to her uncle's punk rock girlfriend Annabel (Jessica Chastain).What makes Mama work is the relationship between the female characters. Chastain ( Take Shelter, Zero Dark Thirty) has the lead role. She's the girlfriend, but becomes the unwilling stepmom to the two girls. The girls accept her to different degrees, but still cling to each other first and foremost. They also cling to 'Mama' and vice versa. Thus what you have is a battle of wills between the supernatural and the living world with the emotional and physical well being of two little girls hanging in the balance. Maybe the presence of Barbara Muschietti (sister of the director) as one of the producers and writers of the film had some influence on having women as the driving force.In addition, Mama might feel and look like the style of Guillermo del Toro film. That could be because he executive produced the film. If you are familiar with his work, you can see his hand in guiding this maiden voyage. Even so, Mama stands on it's own merits. It's far from perfect. The acting, especially from the kids, some trippy and macabre imagery , and a bit of a twist might make you want to sleep with the lights on.",6,40,65,17 January 2013
The Conjuring," Believer or skeptic, the film is worth a viewing
","Nowadays, reality television seems to thrive with audiences that want a peek into the lives of others. The feature length film, The Conjuring, isn't exactly a reality show, but does claim to be loosely based off the real life experiences of Ed and Lorraine Warren (paranormal investigators) and the Perron family. Like many horror flicks preceding, the implication that the events are somewhat real, does add a level of anxiety to the viewing experience. One of the film's trailers even features a family, in a documentary style interview, who asserts they are the family the film is based upon. It just may be left up to the viewer to decide how real, but the suggestion of true events will lend itself to a bit of buzz over the flick.It's during the 70s that Roger (Ron Livingston, Office Space) and Carolyn Perron (Lily Taylor, The Haunting) moved their five daughters into a tattered New England home, which has a dark history the family is unaware of. The immense dead tree in the yard, the shadowy lake, and large ominous house act as foretellers, but that apparently isn't enough to steer this family away from home ownership. As expected, the mysterious occurrences happen from the beginning, though the pacing of paranormal activity is slow as the momentum of the film builds. April (Kyla Deaver), is the Perron's youngest daughter, and is the first to come in contact with the other side when she finds an antique music box. It's through the music box that she begins to see a young boy close to her own age.After some time and several incidents, Carolyn cannot deny that something powerful and evil is terrorizing her home; she seeks the help of Ed (Patrick Wilson, Watchmen) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga, Higher Ground). The Warren's are known for their expertise and experience with the supernatural. Lorraine, a clairvoyant, immediately senses the forces inside the home during her first visit. They later uncover the history of the property and determine the only possible way the Perron family would ever be completely safe is a sanctioned exorcism of the home performed by the Catholic Church. In the meantime, things escalate and as the evil forces react to the constant and threatening presence of Ed, Lorraine, and their team of investigators. It's soon evident that the Perrons are not the only ones in danger.Director James Wan (Insidious), successfully reinvents the classic horror flick. The film is light on gore, but heavy with suspense and edge of your seat moments. It seems the audience cringes most at what's not there than what is revealed. He masterfully builds tension at just the right moments until the scene erupts with a crescendo. In one scene Christine (Joey King), one of the daughters, is awaken by one of the demonic forces. Her slow search of the dark room turned up nothing visually for the audience, but nonetheless turned out be one of the most terrifying scenes, leaving the audience in a prolonged state of anticipationâ€”all the while waiting for the big scare.An experienced cast further propels The Conjuring. The five young ladies cast as the daughters all perform excellently and plays 'scared to death' quite convincingly. The four veteran leads: Farmiga, Wilson, Livingston, and Taylor are brilliant, though Farmiga and Taylor pilot this feature as the tortured female leads. Whether you're a believer or skeptic, the film is worth a viewing.follow us @mediumraretv",7,1,3,19 July 2013
Straight Outta Compton," An Excellent Film!
","Making a biopic is no easy accomplishment. There are always going to be yells that certain people, places, things were left out or shown in a bad light,etc. There's no guarantee that the filmmakers will have the blessing from the actual living persons or estate. There is the chance that the person or persons cast won't be able to convince the audience. And of course, can the filmmakers pull the whole thing off? In the particular case of Straight Outta Compton, there's no need to worry from the audience or the cast and crew. It's phenomenal. With only one known entity, albeit an amazing one, director F. Gary Gray (Law Abiding Citizen, Be Cool), screenwriters Jonathan Herman, Andrea Berloff and the entire filmmaking team used almost all unknown actors and zeroed in on a group, time, and place that unfortunately and uncannily is still relevant to this day.Straight Outta Compton is the story of the groundbreaking rap group known as N.W.A. The group started in the mid-80â€²s with the hardscrabble life of growing up with gang violence, drugs, and police brutality as their backdrop. Using their street knowledge, talent for writing, sound mixing, rapping, and some capital courtesy of one of the members, N.W.A. set themselves apart from other groups and styles of the time. Dr. Dre, MC Ren, DJ Yella, Ice Cube and Easy E combined infectious beats with incendiary rhymes to give a voice to a generation of urban youth who were waiting for someone to tell it like it is.From the opening scene, the die is cast that Straight Outta Compton is going to be an intense, detailed slice of life. A police tank equipped with a battering ram knocks down the whole front of a house and knocks a woman all the way across the room. It's not overseas, it's in the 'hood. It's a powerful scene and amazingly done. Counter that with Dr. Dre (Corey Hawkins) laying on his back, headphones on, amongst albums strewn across the floor. He's listening to a Roy Ayers classic, deep in thought, then his mom turns off the record player killing his vibe. The movie is rife with these kinds of details, including Jheri curls and activator.This being a film about a musical group, it would be remiss if there was no mention about the score and soundtrack. Straight Outta Compton not only has N.W.A.'s music, it also has R&B, soul, jazz, and some disco. The music is there and it sounds really good from a quality perspective. Kudos to the music and sound people.The film is rich with characters. Each member of the group gets his due and others that were on the periphery get a nod. Props to Cindy Tolan for the casting choices because to mention everyone in this review would be difficult and to single out certain performances is almost impossible. This is especially true for viewers who might not be familiar with who is who. For instance, N.W.A.'s encounter and dealings with Marion 'Suge Knight. R. Marcos Taylor not only looks like the imposing, maniacal, mountain of a man, his performance is menacingly spot on. However, because Straight Outta Compton centers for the most part on Easy E, Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, and their manager Jerry Heller, the spotlight is on them. Making these characters come to life and leaving an indelible impression on you is the work of Jason Mitchell, the aforementioned Corey Hawkins, O'Shea Jackson Jr., and Paul Giamatti, respectively. It was a stroke of near genius and enormous confidence to shoot a 2 1/2 hr film about rappers with unknowns and then ask Giamatti (John Adams!) to sign on. The scenes involving these actors are funny, poignant, and intense. None more so than when the group is outside the recording studio and get harassed by the police, or finally getting Easy E to step into the sound booth. All four of these actors deserve recognition but especially Mitchell and Giamatti.For those who might not like rap or to be more specific 'gangsta' rap, the film is more than that. From start to finish Straight Outta Compton is an amazing film. Timing is everything and with what is going on right now in society, makes it that much more profound.",Null,6,33,13 August 2015
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," A Powerful Adaptation Of The Second Book
","The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is a powerful adaptation of the second book in The Hunger Games Trilogy. Director Francis Lawrence has successfully taken the franchise and built from the first film's foundations. This was a smart choice as the characters, world and themes of the story are now more fleshed out and most importantly- easier to see (no shaky cam).Picking up almost a year after the first film, Catching Fire finds Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence, no relation to the director) still reeling from her time in the arena during the previous years' Hunger Games- a scare tactic to keep the people of 'Panem' quiet and grateful to their oppressors as they watch 24 of their children go into a televised fight to the death. Katniss and Peeta (Hutcherson) are the first double winners of the games thanks to their 'true love'. Now both of them find themselves thrown back in to the arena as the evil President Snow (Donald Sutherland) declares that the reaping of the tributes will be selected from previous winners of the games.Jennifer Lawrence gives an intense, heartbreaking and invigorating performance as the reluctant heroine Katniss. She really seems to grasp the pain and terror Katniss goes through throughout the film. Katniss is not a girl of many words but when you have an actress who can convey genuine emotion without speaking- it doesn't matter.As Peeta, Josh Hutcherson (The Kids Are All Right, Epic) has grown from the baby faced baker's boy to a steadfast calm in an ongoing storm, keeping Katniss tethered to sanity. Liam Hemsworth still has minimal screen time as the lovesick and angry Gale, but he also represents the inner turmoil of an oppressed society that has had enough.Elizabeth Banks is stunning to watch as the overdressed and chipper Capitol escort Effie Trinket. Her outfits scream Capitol City Coutour, and she smiles with mad ignorance at the pain and oppression happening in Panem. Yet her face, when Katniss and Peeta are again called to be in the arena, shows a woman torn between her friends and her lifestyle. Jenna Malone gives a memorable turn as the troubled tribute Joanna. She is a controlled manic bringing electricity to every scene she steals. Joanna is a character only an actress as devoted and creative as Malone could pull off so magnificently.Sutherland's power obsessed President Snow is again given much more screen time than page time in the books. This is a smart move for the film. Snow represents the evil of The Capitol without the thrill and glamor of it. He is a man desperately holding on to a system that is bound to fall apart. Sutherland revels in the role and brings his own special brand of creepiness to it. In one scene Katniss and Snow converse across a desk that seems to be the only thing between them killing one another with their bare hands. The tension is high and that is the beauty of two highly skilled actors playing off one another.The film leans a little too heavily on the romance between Gale and Katniss. In the books Katniss indeed cares for Peeta and Gale, but she doesn't really have time or heart for romantic love. She is seen showing affection to Gale and this betrays her character. It does the book and it's message a disservice by hyping up a love triangle that certainly exists but is secondary to the story.Gone is the shaky cam from the first film, though it maintains its moody dark blue and grey color scheme. Shot in Hawaii, the Arena is almost exactly as pictured in the book and all the horrors they face keep you on the edge of your seat until the heart pounding finale. Catching Fire is in no means a feel good film. There is very little comic relief as the stakes get higher and higher and the people of Panem get angrier and angrier. All while the citizens of the glittering Capitol City watch the blood shed and horrific chaos from their comfy seats in their temperature controlled theaters, wearing their colorful clothes and eating their endless supply of junk foodÂ… seems a little familiar doesn't it? - Christina Kishpaugh www.mediumraretv.org",8,2,19,21 November 2013
Godzilla," A marvel to experience
","When it comes to iconic movie monsters, few others can come close to the King of the Monsters himself, Godzilla. Director Gareth Edward's 2014 Godzilla film is the second time that an American studio has taken the reigns in an attempt to bring Japan's most famous kaiju to the big screen. Its predecessor in 1998 met mixed to negative reviews, but this update pays homage to the original 1954 Japanese film while at the same time modernizing the tale for a new audience.The film follows Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), a lieutenant in the United States Navy who specializes in disposing of explosive ordinances. Ford's parents, Joe (Bryan Cranston) and Sandra (Juliette Binoche) work in a Japanese nuclear plant when a terrible accident occurred in 1999. Fifteen years later, Joe is a conspiracy theorist on the search for truth when he is arrested for trespassing on the remains of his old house, now a quarantine zone. Joe believes that it was not a natural disaster that took his wife, but some kind of creature that the government is trying to cover up. Now, believing that history is repeating itself, he embarks on a search for his old data, dragging his son along with him.While the plot of Godzilla is told from the perspective of Lt. Brody, everyone knows who the real star of the film is and the director took great care in portraying the monster in a positive light. The real threat to humanity in the film are two giant, insect-like monsters, called M.U.T.O. (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism) who are attempting to meet and reproduce. The beast known as Godzilla is described by resident monster expert, Dr. Serazawa (Ken Watanabe, The Last Samuri) as a prehistoric animal who is 'nature's power to restore balance.' The director spends a great deal of time in the first act of the movie teasing the audience with the scaly hero, and it was a smart decision to build the tension and anticipation before revealing the beloved monster in a roaring crescendo of excitement.The human story in Godzilla is necessary and while not the most gripping, it remains entertaining enough that it doesn't seem to hurt the action. Aaron Taylor-Johnson (Kick-Ass) is the film's protagonist and the audience watches the story unfold from his perspective. Viewers will be able to get behind the Navy Lieutenant desperately trying to get back to his family and protect them, and also playing his part to save the world. Taylor-Johnson's performance, however, was rather thin and could have benefited from more emoting as opposed to the serious, blank stare he wears for the majority of the film. Conversely, Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad) really steals the show as Taylor-Johnson's eccentric father digging for the truth. He shows so much emotion in his time in the film, that it's a shame that his screen time is cut rather short. Ken Watanabe is great in his role and conveys a sense of respect for the titular monster. Elizabeth Olsen as Ford's wife Elle, spends almost the entire film worrying about the safety of her husband and son, but not much else.Edwards' decision to portray the monsters as animals fighting for their own survival helped keep an otherwise fantastical film somewhat grounded in reality. In addition to the breathtaking visuals, the score by Alexandre Desplat is beautiful, perfectly pulling emotion from the audience. Technically speaking, Godzilla as a film is a marvel to look at, hear, and experience.-Oliver Pascual www.mediumraretv.org",7,9,17,15 May 2014
