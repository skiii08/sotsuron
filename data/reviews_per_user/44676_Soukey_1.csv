Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The movie we've all been waiting for!
",A wonderful roller-coaster ride of a film.  The CG effects earn an 11. Leaves you waiting for the next movie.  The only problem is the obvious shoe-horning of C-3PO into the movie.  I can understand Lucas wanting the famous droid in the film but I really think they could have found a more plausible way to introduce him.,9,0,0,19 May 1999
