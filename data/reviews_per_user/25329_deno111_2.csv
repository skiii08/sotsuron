Iron Man 3," Flying parts of a suit and fire breathing universal soldiers didn't do it for me
","The Iron Man 3 movie is a total slap in the face to the Iron Man 1 and 2 movies. The scriptwriters tried to put something new and fresh in the movie, that differs from the first two, but in my opinion, they have flunked all the way. This script should never see the light of day. It should have been rewritten.I can remember particular sections of the Iron Man 1 and 2, because they were memorable. Fighting scenes, development of the main character, plausible villains, etc. Nothing is memorable in the Iron Man 3, so it is quite easy to forget what you were watching actually. Flying suits powered by mini jet propulsion motors, biologically (chemically?) created universal soldiers, that can generate heat at 3000 Celsius, and so on, doesn't cut it in this movie. Kidnapping a US president is something that we have seen too many times and is over chewed.The acting of Robert D. Jr, is great. No one else could do an Iron Man better than he did. Also the supporting cast is very good, considering they had to work with such crappy script.Supprisingly the current rank of this movie is 7.4, which is quite high. I give this movie a 6, and even that is generous.",6,3,4,2 July 2014
Jurassic World," Did Steven Spielberg loose his Mojo??
","I watched this movie, and it doesn't hold a candle to Jurassic park (1993). Jurassic park was a magical experience, this is just another money making movie. And that's what bothers me the most. Why did Steven Spielberg settle for this kind of script anyway? Or he just doesn't care anymore. Sexy redhead running in high heels, afraid of the hybrid dinosaur, but not so much of T-rex, Velociraptors communicate with humanÂ… So many absurdities are in this movie, that make it less plausible. Watching Spielbergs early movies, I see how much love and effort was invested to make movies real, from actors to effects. When the script is good, when the actors really do their best and with good special effects, you get a classic picture, that will stand the test of time. In this move only effects were good, acting was mediocre, and the script was poorly written. All in all the movie wasn't all that bad, but I expected a little more from Spielberg, especially when Jurassic park sequels weren't accepted as good as the first movie.",7,10,23,5 December 2015
