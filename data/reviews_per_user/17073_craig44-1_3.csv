Scarface," a fine parody of the 80s
","In Tony Montanas' drug-financed mansion is a chair closely resembling a throne with Tony Montanas' own corporate logo monogrammed on the back.On the surface 'Scarface' is just a standard gangster movie, but i believe screenwriter Oliver Stones intention was to satirize the corruption of the American dream by the 'Greed is good' mentality of the 1980s. Like many Americans of the time, the drug gangs of Scarface believe that attaining wealth and the symbols of wealth is the essence of the American dream.In the end, Tony sits on his garish 'throne' snorting cocaine while his superficial empire crumbles around him.If 'Saturday Night Fever' symbolizes the silliness of the 1970s, 'Scarface' symbolizes the excesses of the 1980s.",Null,0,1,16 June 2007
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," almost as good as the original
","The first 'Terminator' is still the best, but T-3 is a very good sequel.Terminator-2 lost much of the frantic pace of the first movie. the Terminator villain played by Robert Patrick was just not menacing enough for my taste.Linda Hamilton ruined her character by shedding the terror and eventual quiet courage she displayed in the first movie.In T-3, Linda Hamilton is absent and John Connor is now an adult living 'off the grid' in order to hide from any new Terminators sent from the future.Nick Stahl does a good job replacing Edward Furlong in the role of John Connor.Stahl plays John Connor as a reluctant hero, who tries to avoid his inevitable fate, until the very end of the movie.Arnold Swarzeneggar will never be a great actor, but he IS 'The Terminator'.Arnolds robotic, monotone delivery is often hilarious in T-3. In one scene, Arnold is driving a demolished hearse, when he calmly states: 'We need a new vehicle'. Kristanna Loken is excellent as the female cyborg.I hope to see her in the next movie.",9,0,1,9 January 2007
Raging Bull," Over-rated movie
","I suppose I am in the minority, but I do not believe 'Raging Bull' is a great movie, or even a particularly good movie.the photography is fine and the acting is very good, but I could find no reason why anyone would make a film about Jake La Mottas' life.There is no question, that Mr. La Motta was a fine boxer, but other than that there is nothing especially noteworthy about him. In fact, Mr. La Motta seems to have been a violent, abusive man.During the film, Mr. La Motta, beats on opponents in the boxing ring, beats on his wife, beats on strangers, beats on his own brother, and beats on cement walls.Jake La Motta isn't the only violent member of the family. Jakes brother Joey(Joe Pesci) commits an extremely brutal assault against a stranger just for talking with his brothers wife. Its fine to make biographical films about less than noble people, but there should be an underlying lesson.All I learned from 'Raging Bull' is that Mr. La Motta was a violent, abusive jerk.",2,36,66,18 April 2008
