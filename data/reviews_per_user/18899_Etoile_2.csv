The Blair Witch Project," Yipes. I think I'll sleep with the lights on tonight.
","I don't like scary movies.  I hate them.  And yet I was dying to see this one, knowing full well that I would be scared out of my pants.  When the reviews came out and critics didn't like it (but admitted to being terrified), I wanted to see it even more. Yes, my audience laughed too, but when it ended the theater was silent as the first few cards of credits flashed by.  (As everyone was leaving, a piercing scream ripped through the theater -- it seems someone had startled someone else, who had been rather frightened by the movie!) I've just designated my cat as the real Blair Witch.  He's ten months old, orange, and very cute -- and that's the only way I'll be able to sleep tonight. The movie didn't make sense until the end, though.  That was when I finally realized it was an actual film, when I found there had been foreshadowing at the beginning (and that's all I'll say!).  Yes, the whining got a bit tiring, yes, the actors could have been a bit better prepared, etc., but on the whole it's a great movie. Good grief, I can't even write a decent review, I'm so scared.  I think I'll put on a comedy tv show before bed tonight.",Null,0,0,6 August 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Well, I think I liked it...
","I like South Park, really I do.  I like it a lot.  But this movie just didn't appeal to me.  Maybe it was the two teens near me who kept repeating every third line (I gave them the benefit of the doubt and blamed it on the pot), or maybe it was the fact that I couldn't hear half the movie because the nearly-sold-out audience laughed uproariously at everything, whether they seemed to understand it or not.The actual jokes and glowing satire, though, were exactly up to Stone's and Parker's standards.  The movie is bursting with funny gags and sharp jabs at anyone and everyone, and the frequent self-referential bits were hilarious. The potty humor, though, sucked.  I know that was the point -- it was supposed to be overdone, but it was pushed just a little bit too far over the line.  I didn't like the nonstop profanity, either: I'm as foul-mouthed as the next person, but the bleeped-out speech on the television show is endlessly funnier than the uncensored version in the movie.I did like the movie, though -- it's funny, irreverent, and downright stupid (which, of course, is the point).  Pay close attention to the scenes featuring Kenny after he dies (and that's not a spoiler...of COURSE he dies), as the computer effects are nothing short of magnificent.",Null,0,0,3 July 1999
