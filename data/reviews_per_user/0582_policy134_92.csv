"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," If you loved Hot Fuzz...
","...then you will be sorely disappointed by this, nice but virtually completely different comedy.Simon Pegg shows that he can be the new Robert Carlyle (remember him from The Full Monty). He is funny, sad and touching but unlike that other brilliant film there doesn't seem to be enough of a comedic hook to sustain interest. The fat man running a marathon seems like a good premise but the director, David Schwimmer's love for drama rather than comedy gets in the way of making this truly memorable.On the plus side, you get a truly great performance from both Simon Pegg and his antagonist, Hank Azaria. It's truly amazing how Azaria can play both nice and really sleazy with equal skill. His turn comes quite unexpected and it's one of the more pleasing aspects of this otherwise ordinary movie.Schwimmer does seem to have a British sensibility and the scenes between the Indian landlord and Pegg are the best moments because they feel so true. You do believe that they could strike up a friendship unlike an American movie where most interracial friendships are severely restricted.Oh, yeah. I almost forgot Thandie Newton. She deserves the most credit since she plays a rather thankless role. The unwed mother, jilted by the Pegg character at the altar (can you feel the cliché machine grinding). Schwimmer wisely makes her a person and not a vicious shrew out for revenge.The end is a bit too unbelievable and you sort of wish it would have ended without showing the actual race. It seems to drag on and on and the wall is really too much.",5,0,1,18 January 2009
The Devil's Advocate," There is a point, but it's a stupid one
","I had watched the trailer for this insipid mess many years before I actually tried to watch it tonight. I had always heard that it was terrible but I had no idea that it would be terrible because of its supposed point of view.Forget all the nonsense you hear about Keanu Reeves giving the worst performance of his life. He is just fine. The problem is that his character is so stupid and oblivious to what is happening until the very end. And when he finally gets it, the plot thins with a spectacularly insipid finale or as I would like to call it 'tacked on ending'. It sort of reminded me of the end of 'Basic Instinct', although less subtle.If you are so inclined as to watch a bad film do so for Al Pacino's final scene. It is so steeped in over-the-top acting, but it's kind of funny how much he invests in it. Do not see this film to get some real insight into religion or for that matter, the law or the American dream. If Taylor Hackford, the director, was trying to make a point about lawyers equaling devil worship, then I think he was about 20 years behind schedule. Even an episode of L.A. Law got that point across more succinctly.I do not regret seeing this, though. I make it a point of seeing something shallow every two months or so. Then I switch to The Bold and the Beautiful for some really insightful storytelling.Note: The last remark was meant as a joke. I do not find The Bold and the Beautiful nearly as insightful as Melrose Place.",1,15,36,18 August 2012
The Mask," Fantasy/comedy beautifully done. Carrey does his best work here.
","It is not easy for me to say this because Jim Carrey is one of my favorite actors but nothing he has done since The Mask is very remarkable or put in another way, his performance here is still his best. I didn't much care for the Ace Ventura films even though they did have a great Carrrey performance. His dramatic roles are mostly admirable but doesn't really stick with you for that long. The Mask was and still is a movie where almost everything was so beautifully done that everything else he has done feels mediocre. Especially, when you look at his other venture into fantasy film with 'The Grinch...' it is but a mere shadow of the sublime universe that is created here.Every time we see a shot of Carrey here is like watching a hundred firecrackers going off at the same time. His Ipkiss character and what happens to him is almost every boy's dream come true. Who among us haven't wished that we could let go of all of our inhibitions and get the girl of our dreams in the process? The production design in the entire movie is also pure gold with bright colors and a film noiresque ambiance. The villain, played by Peter Greene, is also truly frightening and Cameron Diaz has never looked better. One fault i can point out is the policemen characters. They are just too buffoonish and belong on a second rate kiddie show. Other than that everything is so well accomplished that a sequel which was initially planned would have ruined the first film. I'm glad that as of this date it still hasn't been made.Jim Carrey might have ambitions to be more than just a comic actor but I think that he should be proud of this film and if he never wins an Oscar he should still consider himself the best comedic actor of the 90's. Too bad there isn't such a category.",8,0,0,25 March 2005
Moneyball," Another triumph from the 'Capote' director
","With all of the focus being on who can make the loudest, use the most spectacular visual effects, it's amazing that this movie made any money at all.Forget that this movie has major stars like Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill in the cast, although they do their characters justice (these are probably the most subdued Hill or Pitt characters you have ever seen). The main reason why it works is because of the really fascinating story behind it.It could have been easy to make the character of Billy Beane into an arrogant jerk, who thinks he knows more than anybody else. Pitt makes the wise choice to play a guy who has nothing to lose and is willing to think outside the box. But he is also humble enough to know that he can't do that alone and quickly realises that he needs somebody like Hill's character, Peter Brand. Brand is the quiet introvert who is brilliant, but doesn't think much of himself. He just turns out to be exactly what Beane needs. It is a lot of fun to see Pitt and Hill play off each other. There couldn't have been a more odd couple in the history of cinema but they have undeniable chemistry on screen.The movie handles baseball as a business, where it is the latest thing you have done that counts. That is usually what people remember. In comes the manager, played by Capote actor Philip Seymour Hoffman. It is of course necessary to make general manager and the manager into adversaries in these types of movies, but Hoffman plays it without the usual cliché of screaming and lecturing because he knows more than the boss. They may hate each other but it is never the main conflict in the show. That goes to Beane's self-doubt about what he is doing and why he is doing it. Again, Pitt handles it beautifully, especially when we learn that he has an ex-wife and daughter. Watch the scene where he is trying to put on a brave face when his team is about to go to the dumps. There is also a hilarious scene featuring Spike Jonze as a more than understanding 2nd husband to Beane's former wife. Simply brilliant.I could go on and on about this fantastic film, but just to add a little more. Were it not for filmmakers like Miller who does these character driven stories so well, we would be forced to read books, just to get the noises out of our heads from the latest superhero flick in theatres.",10,2,3,2 February 2013
Men in Black 3," That thing is disgusting.
","It was worth the wait. Men In Black 3 is a worthy entry into the franchise. Too bad, that Tommy Lee Jones' screen time was so short, though.Luckily, K's younger self, played with 100% conviction by the ever dependable Josh Brolin, was a magnificent casting decision. Who knew, that this guy would end up being a hell of a lot more revered than his father. As far as I can recall, James Brolin's only claim to fame is Barbra Streisand.There is an abundance of good supporting parts in this one too. The guy who teaches J about time travel, and more importantly, that it's not such a great thing to be a black man in the 60s. The following scene doesn't work as well, though, where Smith is hassled by some not too enlightened cops. This is a PG-13 movie, so you can't go overboard with the racist remarks. Luckily Smith saves it by a great one-liner.Speaking of Smith, the problem with the first sequel was that he basically had to carry the first part of the movie and the character got too arrogant at times. Here, he is still kind of arrogant, but he is quickly shown that he still doesn't know dick. That I like.The one scene I absolutely could not stand was set in a restaurant. That fish gave me the creeps and I think that the scene borders on eastern bashing once again in an American movie. We are obviously free targets in Hollywood these days. Luckily, the scene is short.All in all, there are some stunning sequences, even though you watch it in the normal format. I have always been a little wary about seeing features in 3D. There is some impressive stunt work, mostly done by the actual actors mixed in with some seamless visual effects work. So let's say that I hope that Men In Black 4 happens, but I think that I will be disappointed yet again. The premise is beginning to wear thin.",8,0,1,1 October 2012
Frost_Nixon," Talking heads = high brow entertainment
","Absolutely worth a watch. Michael Sheen continues to impress and although I can't really say that Frank Langella's Nixon is spot on, he delivers exactly the right combination of moodiness, oafishness and even the right amount of humor to the character that wasn't seen in the biopic 'Nixon'.Special mention must go to Ron Howard, who not only makes a subject that won't appeal to the average moviegoer exciting, but he actually makes you wish that you could have lived through the actual time when all of this happened.One tiny flaw if you can call it that, the faux interviews with the parties involved. They really don't add that much and distract from the absolute brilliant portrayals by actors Sam Rockwell et al in all other scenes.One brilliant moment: When Sam Rockwell's character has just chewed out Sheen's Frost about blowing one of the interviews and Frost's revelation of his upcoming birthday party. Awkward! Nixon will be remembered as the one who shamed the United States and this film doesn't redeem him. It does try to give him a break and not portray him as a deceased joke (sorry). As for Frost, it was his crowning moment and everybody loves the underdog who makes good story, right. I certainly did here.",9,0,1,9 September 2009
The Incredible Hulk," Next, please!
","Another comic book to live action adaptation and of the same character as a film previously made, in fact.What can you say? Is it entertaining? Sure. Is it funny? Definitely. Is it worth a price of a movie ticket? Not really.The problem is that the movie is all setup. It makes numerous references to upcoming Marvel projects that will entice the moviegoers to go for another round. Not that there is not some things in its favor, particularly Edward Norton as the title character. He is as always a joy to watch.William Hurt scores too with his 'Everything for the cause' character. Liv Tyler is essentially wasted. The exploration of her connection to Bruce Banner is underdeveloped (something that the 2003 film put more into focus) and some of her lines are downright ridiculous ('It's okay. Bruce, look at me!) Tim Roth does well, although the character is also a bit underdeveloped (maybe as another setup for future installments). For comic relief we have another Tim and you already know what his purpose in the plot is so why spoil it by repeating it.So, worth a rental, skillfully made, but wish it could have been more than a preview of what's to come.",7,3,5,29 October 2008
Iron Man 3," Hollywood women look great, don't they?
","This is a little late to write commentary on the third installment of the franchise, but I just can't help myself.As usual, Robert Downey Jr. does great as Stark and I can't think of anyone who looks better in this universe. His age is starting to show, though. But if I looked as good in my present age, as he does at almost 50, then some wrinkles is a small price to pay. One who looks even better is Gwyneth Paltrow. Just goes to show you that California sun does miracles. Or is it that miracle innovation called surgery. I doubt it. She looks way too natural.Anyway, what was I talking about? Oh, yeah! Iron Man 3. Well, it doesn't stink. How about that? Except, there are some crucial errors, mostly due to casting. Ben Kingsley is a good actor but what the hell is what that accent? I know he's supposed to be a British actor playing the mandarin but shouldn't it therefore be an Asian accent he's adopting? Rebecca Hall who plays one of Tony's conquests I believe is British. I first saw her in Frost/Nixon but she hides her Britishness very well. It is also nice that we see her tryst with Tony way in the past because I don't think Tony would have gone for her when the main storyline is set. There is a twist to her character but to be honest, it's not that big of a surprise.Of course, now he is involved with Pepper and we get the usual relationship quarrels from a thousand other movies. Fortunately, these scenes are short and don't ruin the overall experience.Now for the worst part. Introduction to a new character which is of course a kid. It's like a bad sitcom where they think this storyline will boost ratings. Please stop.Anyway, there isn't really that much to recommend about this show except action scenes. But isn't that what kids wanna see? Unfortunately, there isn't that much action except for that sensational helicopter who does what? It has something to do with putting the actors in danger?",5,1,2,6 July 2015
Casablanca," Bogart's distinctive character in practically every scene
","The film that made Bogart a major star is not what I expected the first time i saw it. After seeing him in the Maltese Falcon which I thought was a brilliant film I decided to give this a try, although I am not really into romantic films as this certainly is. The love story is truly one of the more memorable ones but it would have been contrived without the war time setting. Everything the characters do may have long lasting effects on their lives or in some cases may even claim their lives. The Rick character, who is supposed to be completely neutral, can't escape being an accomplice in what the Laszlo character is deeply involved in. It's not only because he loves Ilsa (Bergman) but you can see that he hates the Germans as much as anybody when he first meets Major Strasser. That aside the Bogart character would never send a decent man to his doom as Laszlo essentially is, even though he is a rather cold hearted bore.The film could have done without the Renault character, who is simply there to make commentary about Bogart's character. Will he or will he not sacrifice Laszlo or his lady love? The comic relief is minor and I suspect that even people who love the film will find anything novel in Rains' appearance.Then finally there is Bergman. Except for being beautiful she must have had some other qualities as well and that is extremely underused in this film. To see her crying every five minutes is not what you would expect a modern woman character to do and indeed her character is simply a hanger-on and besides being the object of affection for both Rick and Laszlo she is supposed to stay in her place.The whole film can be described as being more entertainment than of actual historical importance and on that level it delivers but it is still funny to think that it was being made at a time when the whole world could have been crushed by the forces of evil and that this could have very well been the last time you would ever see a movie that criticised Nazism.",9,0,2,1 October 2005
Lifeboat," Intelligent drama and you actually have to keep up with it
","There was only one true master of 20th century cinema and you can guess who that was. I haven't really found any director who could make so many exciting and interesting films as this brilliant man. Others had their hits and misses, but only he scored time and time again.Lifeboat, while not as visually exciting as North by Northwest or Psycho is all that high drama should be. Sure, it has tricks up its sleeve and you might get lost if you don't follow what's on the screen, frame by frame.One minor flaw is that it tries to cram a moral down your throat at the very end, something I would never believe would be in a Hitchcock film but I suppose, that it was a different time in the world from 1939 to 1945. Maybe it was the producers who forced Hitchcock to make this a message picture at the last minute.Still, it has some great performers like Tallulah Bankhead. I just love her voice. William Bendix as the wounded soldier is quite effective too but the winner has to be Walter Slezak, as the sinister German U-Boat Captain.There is something that I noticed at the mid-point, involving the death of one of the characters. It leaves a lot of questions and I took little notice to it the first time around. Watch it yourself and you will see how it is never properly dealt with throughout the rest of the picture and that is exactly what Hitchcock intended. Because of that scene, I will say that this was something out of the ordinary at that time, where you were usually treated to a lengthy explanatory sequence about how the whole thing happened. It makes the movie all that more interesting.",7,1,1,25 June 2012
As Good as It Gets," One of the best films of '97
","How they managed to make this movie so great I'll never know. They took a rather disgusting character and somehow made him sympathetic and I don't say that because he has mental problems. There doesn't seem to be any kind of resolution to his problems at the end of the movie either. So why do I think it's so great, simply because of Jack Nicholson. Yes, he is somewhat of a ham but in this movie he captures every emotion so perfectly. From paralyzing fear to extreme happiness. He certainly deserved the Oscar for this one.Helen Hunt also got the role of a lifetime. Her Carol is your basic tortured soul, but she never loses her sense of humor either. Greg Kinnear has the most difficult role. He used to be a newscaster for E! so the camera was not new to him at the time, but to start with such a strong performance is incredible. His role requires a lot of crying but he somehow pulls it off without hamming it up.Like many have written on this site it's the characters that make this movie and over the years James L. Brooks has formed a lot of relationships with prominent actors. This is the third time he and Nicholson work together. Even Yeardley Smith of the Simpsons make an impression in a small role. So what more can you say - this is an actors picture and I'm glad that it beat out Titanic in in both nominations and wins in the actor category.Sadly, Nicholson and Hunt haven't really made a worthwhile movie since so I have a suspicion that winning Oscars doesn't really feed your prolific-ism. Nicholson has only made two or three movies since this one and Hunt even fewer.",9,0,1,24 March 2005
Iron Man 2," The '2' is very much apparent
","I understand that this was a big hit in theaters, and it is very well made and you couldn't have put together a better cast. The story is clever and there are a few twists that I did find amusing and surprising.That said, I got kind of bored by the revelry in Tony Stark's self destructive behavior. Okay, you need a hook that seems new and interesting but I thought I was going to see a fun action movie. This seems more lifted out of a Scorsese movie. The first one was a of corse a brand new discovery for me, but it seems that it had more of the wiseass humour, that I like so much. Not so here. The laughs are of the 'I like to see people in pain' variety. The action scenes, although well made, seems too reliant on CG. The talking computer drives me crazy. It's good its voice is absent from the most part at the end.Now for the good parts: The scene at the hearing. Hilarious. Not just from Downey Jr, but also Sam Rockwell and of all people, Garry Shandling. It's a bit of an odd opening, but it's clever. Using the Iron Man technology as a parody of the world's fear of nuclear bombs was inspired. Think the second Iraq and North Korea. North Korea actually got slammed pretty badly here. Lucky, they can't sue.The Mickey Rourke character? Is it just me or does he get uglier and uglier every year. That's a compliment. His duplicity and abilities comes as a complete surprise, when finally revealed at the Stark Expo.They found a suitable replacement for Terrence Howard, although Don Cheadle is probably better suited for high drama. His character's IQ seems to have dropped a few points as well.One thing, though. What's with the Audi plug? Tony Stark's car and the big sign at the Expo.",6,0,1,8 October 2010
Mississippi Burning," Probably the best movie of the late 80s
","Some would probably disagree with the sentence above and point to Rain Man or Born on the 4th of July in that category, and they were good but focused more on the stars then on the actual story. It's a funny coincidence that Tom Cruise was in both of them.Mississippi Burning is a movie without star performances and simply focuses on telling the story. Granted, the real story about the actual event is heavily dramatized but it is really only to the benefit of the affect the movie has. There are superb performances of both Hackman, Dafoe and McDormand but they only service the story, which is rare in a Hollywood movie. No grand speeches about racial prejudices, just quiet observations.Where it gets its points across more loudly is in the violence. Be warned, this is a disturbing movie and should not be seen by children. However, the violence is far from gratuitous. Some people on this posts have complained that the white people look like ignorant, violent bastards here and the black people look too noble. That may be true but think about it, would you really have seen this if the black people were as vicious as the whites. You have to have somebody to admire in a mainstream film. Just look at all the films from the 30s and 40s? Was that more to you liking than people portrayed here? I think that people who complain about the white characters here should really think about what they are seeing. This is a film that focuses on two white characters and it is made by a Brit, not a black person.",9,2,2,26 June 2011
Stripes," Nowhere as funny as the similar Animal House but quite good if you are in the mood for a no-brainer
","Everyone knows that Bill Murray has come a long way from his SNL days and the mostly embarrassing movies he made through most of the 80's and 90's, but it is still fun to see him as just a goofy guy as he plays in this one. Harold Ramis made his first joint appearance here with Murray and I must say that they make a pretty good team. Many of their collaborative efforts like the 2 Ghostbusters movies and the Ramis-directed Groundhog day was simply shear hilarity. However, Stripes is not nearly as easy to sit through as those marvels. I don't know what it is but it seems that this kind of material has always been beneath both Murray and Ramis. If every major player in this film hadn't made better films than this one you would probably have forgotten about it in little time.There are some vaguely familiar faces scattered across every minute of this film. John Diehl from 'Miami Vice' plays a rather dimwitted character, as does Judge Reinhold from 'Beverly Hills Cop'. Then there is of course the great John Candy who was a little bit embarrassed to do one particular scene with a pair of not so dressed women but of all the supporting players he is the one who makes the most of what he is given here. Last but not least there is Warren Oates as the gruff but kind of decent Sgt. Hulka. He has his greatest moment when he tells the totally idiotic character 'Psycho' to lighten up. Oh, and I almost forgot the love interests of Ramis and Murray who are quite good looking but never rises above their decorative parts. It is funny to think that Sean Young as one of the ladies was completely forgotten after only 10 years in the movies, especially when she lost two choice roles in the 2 first Batman movies.There is not much more to say than this is only entertaining in the first part of the movie, mainly because there are so many great one-liners from Murray but the whole second part involving a missing tank falls flat because this is not 'War Games' and to make this into something that it's not is just a shame.",6,3,4,5 September 2005
Public Enemies," Letdown, but still good entertainment
","Okay, this isn't the all time greatest flick ever made but a less then perfect Michael Mann movie, is still better than average.I don't know, but after seeing the big, loud and noisy shootout in Heat, seeing it being repeated time after time here gets a little dull. There is basically nothing wrong with the performances by Johnny Depp, Christan Bale and especially Billy Crudup as Hoover, but I wish that Mann would have delved a little deeper into what made Dillinger the admired and feared figure that he was.We see him escaping from prison but we are essentially left in the dark about how he was able to outsmart the law time and time again. There is a scene reminiscent of the one in Heat, where Bale's and Depp's characters come face to face but afterward there is no resolution. Bale's character is oddly uninvolved with the capture of Dillinger at the Biograph.Instead we are presented with the long time tradition in cops vs. robbers films of bad guys on both sides. There is an especially nasty sequence with the law interrogating a witness. On the criminals' side we get Baby Face Nelson, who is made out to be such a caricature that he doesn't tickle the funny bone at all, you merely wonder why Dillinger didn't plug him after the first heist. The movie doesn't explain why they were associates.Depp is absolutely one of the greatest assets to have in a movie, but if the character he is given is so nondescript, you can't be anything but disappointed. Depp is not needed here. If Bale and Depp had switched roles it wouldn't have made any difference.",6,0,1,20 July 2009
Madagascar," It went right over my head
","Now that the sequel has been out for quite some time, I thought I should see this one just to compare. When this was first released I couldn't have cared less. Talking animals - done a million times, right? Yes, but it is done with smart voice-over work from all involved and great animation that has come a long way from the first PDI/Dreamworks collaboration, Antz.Ben Stiller scores with a perfect character in line with most of his other screen performances. Alex, the urbanised lion who is comfortable in his sheltered life and think he is pretty hot stuff. He gets a serious wake up call, though when the plot kicks in and he discovers that the world doesn't necessarily revolve around his needs.Chris Rock is the real revelation, though. His voice works beautifully with the zebra with a yearning for adventure and he proves that he doesn't have to resort to four-letter words to be funny. Big improvement from basically the same restriction he had when hosting the Oscars.Jada Pinkett Smith is lost in basically doing schtick that wasn't really funny 20 years ago but she is also not served that well of not having a story of her own, as she did in the sequel. And as for David Schwimmer, dead on casting of a neurotic, kind of dopey hypochondriac. He almost out-Woodies, Woody Allen. Not that I am much of a fan of both of them.Other than the voice talent, the basic premise of tamed animals released in the wild is pretty neat, although once they are there, the movie runs out of steam. The jungle creatures voiced by Sacha Baron Cohen and Cedric the Entertainer are good for a few chuckles but you wish that the filmmakers had done more than having them be cowardly and manipulative. As for the penguins, they are there merely there to look cute and quote not too clever pop references.Alex almost giving in to his primal instincts is a pretty clever. If you don't know, lions do eat zebras. Moral dilemma at its most ironic. But you somehow know that it can't lead to anything. After all, this is a PG-rated movie.There is no doubt that Dreamworks/PDI is one of the best in bringing these stories to life but what you are basically left with is an animated movie that doesn't really impress other than die hard movie buffs who think all animation is great.",5,0,0,17 April 2009
Hot Fuzz," My two cents
","There seems to be 50/50 split between those who like this and those who think it is absolute trash. For my part, I enjoyed it but you definitely have to be a fan of straight action movies to really get the whole feel of what the director, Edgar Wright and the writer/star, Simon Pegg were trying to do here.This is not a direct parody of action/thriller/buddy movies. It really stands on its own but all the clichés of these movies are put in here, some meant as parody and some for purpose. It's a dangerous combination but Wright/Pegg pulls it off. The actors who play it absolutely straight and especially Nick Frost must be credited by giving the rather ridiculous plot some resonance. Nick Frost as Danny Butterman is absolutely brilliant because the character is kind of sad but at the same time you never feel sorry for him.The movie is a bit too long and it ends with a cheat that is a bit hard to swallow. Still, the other way around may have been too depressing for what is essentially a comedy (think Lethal Weapon 2). What can you do? So, over the top? Definitely. But engaging and you really have to admire the care that was put into it.",8,0,1,16 January 2009
Ed Wood," Wood would have been proud of himself had he lived to see this.
","If Ed Wood had lived today, his opinion of this movie would probably have been 'This is the one they're gonna remember me for'. This just goes to show you that he had absolute blind faith in himself and thought that he was the best director ever. Everybody by now knows that he couldn't have been more wrong but it isn't because he is full of himself but because he so desperately tries to fulfill his dreams that he can't see the cardboard sets he uses. He looks at them like they were paved with gold.Tim Burton has the look of the Z-movie environment exactly right and this is definitely the most entertaining biography ever made. When compared to the rather lifeless 'Chaplin' which is supposed to be about a man that was a great deal more respected than Wood, I can only say that all through 'Chaplin' I kept thinking about how I could get out.The cast is excellent right down to some of the bit players. The father of Ron Howard, Rance, has a hilarious cameo as one of Wood's backers who wants a movie to end with a big explosion. As far as Johnny Depp is concerned, the only way he could have been better was to find the trick to melt into another man's body because it is absolutely a performance of a lifetime.",10,0,0,5 August 2005
Yes Man," A mood-lightener but not much else
","Can't really say I was laughing out loud all the way through this. The movie is too cute and Jim Carrey doesn't get to cut loose because of his character, Carl, (has there ever been anyone funny in the movies with a name like that?) spends half of the movie being depressed. Other than Zoey Deschanel (I can't spell it), Carrey is basically the whole show here.The premise was bad from the start. A man who can't say no but it is too much like the lawyer who can't lie. Sorry, but there is no other way of putting it but you are basically being suckered into seeing Liar, Liar once again but unlike that hilarious film most of the jokes just aren't funny.The supporting characters are left with nothing to do except being mildly obnoxious (check out the old lady). Danny Masterson looks particularly out of place and Brad Cooper, who was remarkable in The Wedding Crashers, is given nothing to do. Terence Stamp must have received some kind of medal for taking every job that is available, although he was kind of funny in Get Smart. He hasn't done anything very memorable since The Hit.So what it boils down to is how well does Carrey do his thing. Well, he doesn't slam his head with a toilet seat but there is a funny little sequence where he and his boss are one-upping each other with weird gestures and a particularly nasty sequence involving Carrey's face and some tape. But these moments are few and far between.One thing though: The band sequence with Deschanel is hilarious and she can actually sing quite well, that is if she wasn't dubbed, I didn't check. She looks pretty and her character is nice but overall she suffers the same fate as the other leading ladies of Carrey's career, that is you can't remember her afterwards.Carrey is fast becoming the one-time great comedian who seems to be repeating himself. This time it just doesn't work.",4,3,5,10 January 2009
Fast & Furious 6," All stage directions
","A slight improvement over Fast Five in that there is a lot less dialogue in this movie, which has never been the series' strong point. Unfortunately, the plot is so uninteresting and undeveloped that any screenwriter could have just written: 'We need some explosions, some car collisions, a threat to the main characters and just for fun let's have a character with amnesia. From what I remember, the screenwriter and the director have been the same, the last three movies. Maybe they were getting bored of the whole thing.Paul Walker's part is totally superfluous and Vin Diesel's is just here to look sad and concerned. Dwayne Johnson gets most of the inane dialogue and Tyrese acts like an idiot most of the running time.So, what we have is millions of dollars wasted on what could have been just as well an animated feature. That's probably what we are gonna get after people have completely lost interest in the franchise.",5,1,4,16 July 2015
Lost in Translation," Murray, the wise ass completely lost
","This little gem was the brainchild of director, Sofia Coppola. Bill Murray gives his finest performance to date and you can see that he could relate to the material. He plays an aging actor who has fallen on hard times and takes a job that will make him a lot of money but it is in something as undignified as a commercial.Coppola does a terrific job of showing us both Bob Harris, the character but she also shows Bill Murray, the screen character who has finally run out of gas. We even get a shot of a young Murray from an earlier film, with the old Murray staring in disbelief of what he is now.Scarlett Johansson is very touching as a woman who is totally confused about what she is and where she is going. Bob and her character Charlotte form a friendship and you can see that they might be falling for each other. One of the surprises of the plot was that it doesn't end with them having sex as is the normal standard in most films. Instead we get a shot of Johansson's disappointed look when she finds out that Bob has another woman in his hotel room.There are many exterior shots of Tokyo and it looks absolutely stunning and the way Coppola shows the Japanese people without condescending their culture, but still make it kind of funny is a tricky feat but she pulls it off.So what more can you say. Murray should have won the Oscar for this magnificent performance and Johansson should at least have been nominated. Let's hope that he hasn't lost courage of doing something like this again because how many Garfield films are there left to do.",9,4,8,9 February 2007
Tangled," Alright for what it is - silly fun
","Although, I am definitely not the target audience for animated movies about lost princesses and evil stepmothers, I am always tempted to see anything animated from Disney, and especially in CGI.The show doesn't open well. I am getting a little tired of funny narration and the opening song left me a little sick to my stomach. When the evil stepmother breaks into song too, (what she actually is, I won't spoil it for those who may not have seen it yet), needless to say didn't help matters much.Things recover a little bit after we are introduced to the gentleman thief. Though, he is nowhere as rogue as I would like (this is after all Disney), I liked this character enough to keep watching. When the lost princess shows a little spunk as well, that's when my interest really kicked in.Now for the best part: Can you believe that it is a song? I couldn't believe it either. It's corny, predictable but handled in such a way that I was surprised I was laughing so much during it. Tough guys with soft hearts have been covered since the silent film days, but whatever. Just look at the scene and you will laugh your head off.The conclusion is again a little predictable and it made me a little sad that the second act didn't sustain itself into the third. Still, the animation is beautiful as is expected from a Disney feature plus that horse is pretty funny too.",6,3,10,7 April 2012
21 Jump Street," Pretty decent reboot/continuation or sequel
","It probably falls flat as straight out parody because there are a few scenes that really borders on syrupy melodrama, but for what it's worth, you do get quite a few good chuckles out of this slick send-up.If there are still people who remember what the original show was about, and there are, the series was pretty much a straight drama. It is therefore refreshing that this is mainly comedic.I will say that I am not a fan of Jonah Hill, and since his name is pretty much all over this (exec producer, writer, star), I will have to blame him for the movie's shortcomings, which are few, but still counts as not recommending the show flat out. Take for example a character played by The Office star, Ellie Kemper. I didn't laugh. Another is one of the main villains, who should have been funny, but just feels annoyingly like a character commenting on the clichés. It should have been funny but again falls flat.Surprisingly, the more inexperienced actors save the day. The kid brother of James Franco is exactly right as to what his character is supposed to represent and it's a nice twist that he represents everything that is uncool to the jock cop, Channing Tatum. As for Channing Tatum, it's odd how much he looks like both Tommy Lee Jones and a little bit Heath Ledger. He is the straight man, so he doesn't really get to strut any stuff, except for a crucial scene somewhere in the middle. He will probably be the next big movie star.So, it offers a few laughs but even though it's a bit long, it curiously has an unsatisfying ending, possibly because they are already cooking up a sequel. The story is also a bit old hat, but all in all, pretty enjoyable.By the way, the cameos are at least hilarious.",7,1,2,15 October 2012
Top Secret!," ZAZ's greatest movie and Kilmer is actually fun to watch
","Germans have always been a target for either parody or down right ridicule and there are not much prejudiced German behavior that isn't given the full once over here. Still, when you see this movie you will find yourself laughing at the most stupid, almost racist remark and you will kick yourself afterward to find out why the hell it was so funny.Let me say that I had absolutely no idea who Val Kilmer was when I first saw this back in the mid-80's but without stretching much of the truth, I have to say that I have never enjoyed watching him more than in this movie. Since then he has mostly disgusted me with the rather ugly characters he has played like Iceman in Top Gun and the worst, Jim Morrison. He had some appeal in Heat but that was a great movie for a whole other reason.There are virtually no other famous actors in this movie and the leading lady, Lucy Gutteridge has never filmed a well known movie to this date as far as I can recollect. The most well known after Kilmer is of course, Michael Gough. It's funny that many years later they would play master and servant in the third Batman film totally by accident.This movie can only be described as pure gold from start to finish and there are so many funny scenes that my eyes were in tears midway through the whole event. If you should point out a flaw it's the annoyingly smug Nigel but I think he was meant to be that way, a total perverted Ken look-a-like.",10,2,5,6 October 2005
The Aviator," Perfect example of style over substance, a rare detour for Martin Scorsese.
","Nobody can deny that Howard Hughes had a tremendous impact, not just on America but over the whole world and to film a biopic of him could never be boring. Another matter is to watch it and I must say that even though the movie does have stunning sequences and you can tell that everything in the flying sequences was well researched, it does leave you rather unfulfilled at the end. The trouble begins, as it usually does with the performances of the actors. Leonardo DiCaprio does well in the opening sequences and in one particular scene (the premiere of Hell's Angels) he captures just about every aspect of his character which unfortunately will be overemphasized through the rest of the movie. Like another of Scorsese's favorites, De Niro, he is pretty much let loose to bring out every emotion that he has in order to make the character a human being, rather than a stereotype.The supporting cast are not so lucky and I must say that even though Cate Blanchett is very good indeed as Katherine Hepburn, she hardly deserved the Oscar for her performance here. Her one great moment is when she and Dicaprio visits her family and they play a game of one-up-man-ship but that is more a collaborative effort.Another supporting actor nominee, Alan Alda, is serviceable as the slimy senator on the take from Alec Baldwin. His scene with Dicaprio at the hotel lunch meeting is some of the best acting he has ever done, despite the fact that it is rather superfluous because it is merely a set up for the big Senate hearing. The third actor worth mentioning is John C. Reilly who is in nearly every major American film today. Here he gets to play a normal character for once but he is terribly wasted. We don't feel that he is all that important neither to Hughes or the film.So to repeat what I said earlier: The story of Hughes is fascinating but like so many biopics it is not completely up to par with the real story. I think the opening caption on this film says it all: 'Based on a true story' and not 'The full story'.",5,3,5,30 July 2005
Burn After Reading," A pleasant surprise, that it delivers what it set out to deliver
","Not the Coens' most ambitious film, that must go to Country for Old men, but it certainly is a very pleasant viewing experience. More accessible to the spectator, not used to the Coens' very unique storytelling.This features some absolute brilliant performances, especially by Brad Pitt and George Clooney. Nobody can quite make idiocy seem dignified quite as good as them. There is a terrible shocking visual about 2/3 into the movie, which might seem ordinary to people used to hardcore violence, but see it and think about who it happens to. Only the Coens' would have the nerve to let that happen.Pretty much devoid of artsy stuff, which is also pretty rare for them, but still not a straightforward action thriller. Not an ordinary film by any means, but not at all confusing which some of their efforts have been. I really couldn't figure out Intolerable Cruelty, which sort of is in the vein of this film.The best performance, though, is by Frances McDormand. You don't quite understand her character's motivations, but she is charming, funny and also kind of sad - everything a character should possess if you are to care about it.So, absolutely worth watching and another shock is the end - I thought really, that's it? But in hindsight, how else could it end?",8,1,4,8 February 2010
BASEketball," Wacky sports satire or whatever it is
","Most of the jokes in here are of the stupid variety. It could have been a funny movie but this is more miss than hit.It starts off well with a somewhat clever plot about then invention of a new game - a game of horse with baseball rules. Oh, and there is also the novelty of one player doing everything he can to psych the other player out, making him miss the target.From then on it turns into a parody of the old plot of greed vs. the love of the game. It is a pretty easy target but like in the game, the director gets psyched out and misses. There are too much emphasis on the division of the two friends, Remer and Coop, played by two less than stellar actors, Matt Stone and Trey Parker.I realise that I am probably in the minority here but just felt that the jokes fall flat too often, especially with Matt Stone, who plays his character as if he doesn't have a clue at all. Watch the reaction from Robert Vaughn whenever he tries to engage Stone in his shady deals. Peter Graves in Airplane said some pretty outrageous things too but it was played more straight. Stone comes off as a raving lunatic which I don't think was intentioned.As for Parker, he may have the right look for a movie actor, but he seriously lacks the talent and he is basically the whole show here. The supporting cast are left looking like idiots, basically letting Parker push them around. Yasmine Bleeth is particularly out of her league as a comedienne which of course makes Parker look like a genius. Ernest Borgnine is again embarrassed in a supporting part that gives him nothing to do but look stupid. I haven't seen an Oscar-winning actor sink so low as he has done again and again, in movie after movie.Do you think you will get a laugh? Maybe once or twice, but this is definitely a movie that should have been heavily rewritten and they should have replaced Parker and Stone.",4,3,8,22 May 2011
Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa," Actually a little bit better than the original
","They are here again. Alex the Lion, Marty, Gloria etc.The back story of Alex is great and whoever thought of casting Bernie Mac as Alex' father deserves some kind of award.Chris rock once again scores as Marty. He may not be able to curse his way through his performance but did you really miss it that much? As the first one, his friendship with Alex is once again put to the test and here is where the movie once again loses its wind. Can opposite species come together? A thinly veiled plot point and not really well thought out.Luckily, there are a hundred more laughs than there were in no. 1. Sacha Baron Cohen is hilarious and the penguins get more clever lines than in the original.David Schwimmer and Jada Pinkett Smith get their love story. Not that great but what are you gonna do? The rival to their romance is a pretty funny character (how many fat jokes are there?).I almost forgot Alec Baldwin. What a good sport, his character is really not that much and still he gives it his all. Not since his self-deprecating performance on the Simpsons have I admired him more than I did here.The animation is improved which is always a good thing but still, the movie isn't the phenomenon it would have been, had it been released a decade ago. Still, did I mention that it is better than the original?",6,0,0,17 April 2009
Edward Scissorhands," The definition of Burtonesque and lets not forget Elfmanesque
","Not Burton's absolute greatest, that honour goes to Ed Wood but everything I associate with Tim Burton is here. The moody atmosphere where everything, though seemingly pretended to be so ordinary, is just a little off. The characters are not well defined from the absolute beginning and it takes a while before we even know what the events portrayed are supposed to lead to.As for Johnny Depp, what can you say other than 'Excellent'. He may have the least amount of dialog ever for a lead role (except maybe Clint Eastwood or Charles Bronson) but what a performance, and keep in mind, this was his one of his first lead roles. He had a bit in Platoon and maybe he did 'Cry-Baby' before this but Burton really lets him have a field day here. This is almost like seeing Chaplin come back to life.As for the supporting cast, Dianne Wiest is absolutely the definition of a suburbanite with too much time on her hands. The color of her dress says it all and the choice to give her glasses is just spot on. Alan Arkin's role is virtually taken out of an old sitcom. Just listen to him trying to explain the definition between right and wrong to Edward. That little kid from 'Honey, I shrunk (whatever)' is just plain annoying, though. Winonna Ryder was also relatively new to movies and you can't really complain about her performance, just say that it's not the best she has ever done.Finally, I will mention Anthony Michael Hill who absolutely shocked the hell out of me when I saw this for the first time many years ago. To go from playing the nerd in 'Sixteen Candles' and 'The Breakfast Club' to this is one weird thing to see. He handles both extremely well and it's a shame that he will forever be branded that brat-packer who was the youngest player on 'Saturday Night Live'.As for the end of this film, it is kind of disappointing. To think that the angry mob accepts the explanation Ryder gives them is a little like seeing an episode of 'Married With Children' that has a happy ending. Burton cheated a little there and to wrap the whole thing up with Depp in the garden of his castle is just a little bit tacked on. Otherwise, this is really a good movie. Not great, but what are you gonna do?",8,0,0,14 October 2006
In the Name of the Father," Nothing but the truth
","A little better than average dramatization about a true story involving a tragedy which not only involved the people accused but many others.The story is basically a father and son story. Daniel Day-Lewis plays an immature man who was wrongly accused and convicted of murder, along with his father as a co-conspirator.Bear in mind, that this story could have been told in many ways. It could have focused on the political aspects or it could have been told from the point of view of the bombing's victims, or rather their next of kin. That could have been a good film as well.As it is, it's pretty good. Day-Lewis and Pete Postlethwaite give it their all but there are a number of sub stories that weigh the whole thing a bit down. For example, the IRA man responsible for the bombing. He is such a cliché character, the godfather within the prison, that distracts from the main story. He is merely a catalyst for making Postlewaithe look that much more sympathetic in the eyes of his son.Secondly, the prison stuff drags on too long. We are hit over the head with what a depressing place this is. A few omissions would have been nice, especially the fight scenes.Finally, the courtroom finale is utterly unexciting. Since it never happened the way it is portrayed, why not have a little fun with it. Emma Thompson is a good enough actor, but the performance definitely did not warrant an Oscar nomination and the judge could have had some better lines. Why not make him a bit more gruff? Other than these points there is enough to enjoy. The interaction between father and son is terrific. Plus an exceptional performances by the women in Day-Lewis' family. The grandmother, especially, is terrific.",Null,0,4,27 July 2011
Spider-Man," Can you spell box office gold?
","Like so many have mentioned in their comments, to think that Tobey Maguire would be the best choice for a role as a superhero would have been highly unlikely if you judged him solely on his performance in 'Cider House Rules' or 'Pleasantville'. But let us not forget that Spiderman's alter ego, Peter Parker is somewhat of a nerd and that is something that Maguire really does resemble (not to insult him).The film itself is a high concept FX extravaganza in the highest form but the story that goes along with it is very compelling. The best scenes are the ones that describes the relationships between the characters, be they between PP and MJ, or between PP and Harry Osborn. It is rare to have a movie that mixes these elements and somehow makes the both work. Superman was quite boring when you didn't see him battle the forces of evil. And speaking of Superman, Peter Parker chooses a similar vocation as Clark Kent, although it is as a photographer, not reporter. That is also somehow connected to Peter Parker's character because before he develops his sense he is more of an observer than a man who interacts with anybody.As for the villain, (there must be an interesting one to make a superhero movie) Willem Dafoe couldn't have been a better choice. The scenes where he shows his affection for both his son and Peter Parker are in sharp contrast to what he will become and it shows that he can play both sides equally well. However, the scene where he talks to his lord and master is annoyingly silly and that somehow makes the dilemma he faces later on less serious because everything is explained beforehand.Peter's love interest MJ (played by the luscious Kirsten Dunst) is nothing short of inspired casting. Instead of having some ultra-glamorous movie queen, we have the girl-next-door and she still seems sexy. Peter Parker's decision at the end regarding her was also the one great surprise that many would say is not that great but that I found totally believable.I haven't seen the second part yet but if rumour is true that it is better than the first one, I can only be glad.",9,0,1,31 July 2005
The Fast and the Furious," I am getting old
","Awful, awful. I avoided seeing any of the Furious movies for over a decade and maybe it was because of the teaser trailer. Maybe it was because it didn't show anything about what the movie was about or maybe it was because the movie itself wasn't aimed at me as an audience. I was almost thirty at the time, but I have enjoyed other movies that were not aimed at my age group like the first Spiderman movie which was released around the same time.What I dislike about the first movie is the stupid dialogue. Yeah, yeah. I know it has something to say about loyalty and whatever but mostly sounds like it was written by a 13-year old. Spiderman was goofy in places but there is a weird kind of tone throughout this, especially in the scenes between Vin Diesel and Paul Walker.There is one particular scene that I didn't get for the life of me. Diesel's thuggish best friend accuses Walker of being a cop and the two of them is ready to kill Walker, but the scene ends without a payoff what so ever. It just cuts to the next scene. What the f...! The friend does inspire one of the funniest scenes in the whole thing. The friend is about to cause trouble because he is incensed that Walker has been accepted so easily by Torreto (Diesel's name in the flick). Diesel loses his temper and says something like: 'I didn't know you either and accepted you'. The friend then replies: 'We were 3, you idiot'. Priceless, even though it's not totally verbatim. I honestly can't remember if I reversed the dialogue, but it is still funny as hell.One more scene I have to mention which is unintentionally hilarious. Walker blows his pistons in the first race. Diesel says something like: 'Oh, we better get that repaired'. The car is steaming and 2 seconds later Walker's car is fine to drive. What did they do? Just throw the pistons in the hood and they magically attached and worked perfectly. Granted, I am not a mechanic but I know a car that has lost its pistons need more work than that. Then there is a guy who says: Cops are coming! Walker and Diesel flees in separate cars and for a very flimsy reason, Diesel decides to park in a garage and just slowly stroll down the street (check out the directors commentary).l The cops spot him and Walker picks him up (of course in the magically reconstructed car).I know I am not supposed to nitpick at plot points like this but they are so obvious here. The races are few and far between which is another problem and they are hard to follow. One thing you could see is the lever that activates the nitrous oxide conveniently labeled 'NOS'. Again, hilarious.There are a lot of other problems with the movie but let's just say I was thoroughly underwhelmed. I knew I was not supposed to see a piece of high art but come on; some b-movies make ten times more sense than this. I was also shocked to find out that Roger Ebert actually liked this and gave it three stars. He attacked films that had much better dialogue and plot developments than this. Maybe his illness was getting to him at that point, but I don't think so.I know my commentary is a little long and perhaps a bit unfair because there are some good elements in the show. A sensational car chase at the end and the best part, Paul Walker, as I am saddened by his death. He could have done so much more than these picture and if you saw one of his first roles in Pleasantville you saw real potential. He looked a lot like a young Paul Newman and could have followed his path which makes his death even sadder. I guess the money eased his pain, though.Note: Do yourself a favor and listen to the director's commentary. Not only is it hilarious but makes you understand the film a whole lot better. I changed my opinion from this being a terrible movie to a terrible movie with some good elements, if that has any relevance to anyone at all.",3,1,3,4 July 2015
Tropic Thunder," Ben Stiller biting the hand that feeds him, yet again
","Although, this is quite amusing and very well made, I can't say that I laughed that much. Ben Stiller shows that he knows show business very well which is pretty obvious since basically everybody in his family are in it. It's just hard to figure out what his aim is. Does he think that method actors go overboard? Does he think that it is the industry or is he just putting everybody on saying he think everything he does is not to be taken seriously? As a straight forward action-comedy the movie sort of works. The actors all do great, especially Robert Downey Jr. and Jack Black. Like Ben Stiller, Jack Black can go totally overboard with cynical characters but here he is actually funny as a bumbling stooge. Robert Downey Jr. once again shows that he is a man willing to do anything for his craft (sort of ironic considering the subject matter). By mocking himself he is pretty much telling us that he's a good sport and who doesn't like that.A whole other matter is the portrayal of the Asians. It's pretty clear that we are a pretty easy target. What can you say? It's pretty much what you would expect. If I actually saw an intelligent portrayal of a single Asian person in a Hollywood blockbuster I would be surprised. I guess it wouldn't be funny.Of course, this is entertainment. Not to be taken seriously but then as I started by saying, what is the point.",7,1,2,9 March 2009
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Annoying, loud and overblown. It's great
","There is a lot of noise in this one and it works great. Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is one of these teen fantasy movies that the director, Edgar Wright specialises in at the moment.In 2007, the delightful Hot Fuzz was released, a movie that I enjoyed enormously, but this is the net, so let me totally nerd out and find all the faults with both films. These are fantasies, folks. Nothing more, and Wright makes wet dreams put on film and not those insightful character studies, like one of last years greatest, The Social Network. Stay connected for that commentary.The characters in here are purely one-dimensional. You don't feel like they evolved at all and yet, I enjoyed them. Ramona Flowers is the key character and she is not that much different than Robot from Lost in Space. She is almost completely devoid of any kind of personality and because of that, the ending puzzles me immensely. Still, she looks nice.The character of Knives is brilliantly played by Ellen Wong. I like the fact that her race is not an issue as in many, many, many Hollywood films. It seems that that's the only race that it's okay to make fun of somehow. She is a weirdo, though, but not because of her race.The plot about the evil exes is of course ridiculous like most comic book to movie adaptations, and the fight sequences does drag on a little bit, but overall, this is entertainment at high value and not much more.",Null,0,5,15 August 2011
Batman Begins," Totally worth the time and money spent
","I saw this on a vacation in London and that was before the film had premiered in Denmark. Not that it matters where I first saw the film, but I was so surprised to find myself enjoying this rather average pop corn flick that I was tempted to see it again when it opened in Denmark.Christian Bale, who I have only seen as a child in 'Empire of the Sun' is adequate if not totally convincing as the tortured soul that is Batman. The opening scene with Liam Neeson as his mentor are somewhat silly, especially when Bale is tested on his complete devotion to 'The League's' cause. Of course, we can figure out which path he chooses because the other way is not in the spirit of his character. Later on, when he again has to choose a path is much more believable dilemma under the circumstances.The one and only Michael Caine sinks his teeth into the role of Albert the Butler. Is it just me or has Caine always had master comedic timing. He plays the role in a much more street wise manor than the aristocratic Michael Gough in the previous four Batman movies. He totally steals the scenes from Bale in which they both appear and it is not often I use that phrase.Now to a rather delicate subject: British faking American accents! Caine tried it in 'Cider House Rules' and now we get Tom Wilkinson (The Full Monty) doing it. I don't know what it is but it creeps me out to hear it. Maybe it's because I know it in the back of my mind that Wilkinson and Caine are not American. If they were totally unknown I probably wouldn't have noticed. That's one of the black marks this movie gets but otherwise the other supporting players couldn't be better, including the Cruise bride-to-be, Katie Holmes, and the truly frightening Cillian Murphy, even without the mask.So not a perfect 10 but pretty darn close and I am almost hoping for a sequel because I thought I was in a very good state of mind throughout the whole ordeal.",9,1,2,30 July 2005
Liar Liar," Carrey does his thing but fairly well this time
","Not that I don't like this movie but after you have seen it there you feel that it could have been a little better. Carrey does what he does best, despite being somewhat prone to overact (there is a prank that one of his co-stars pulls on him that is absolutely hilarious in the out-takes). Still, you get the feeling that this was not (for a lack of a better word) a high priority film. Yes, it's entertaining but Carrey is the whole show here. The other actors' performances could just have easily been reading from cue-cards through the whole thing and it wouldn't have made much of a difference.The reason I give it a 7 is simply because of Carrey's outrageous performance when he is under his son's spell and from who else could you see a man brushing his tongue and still find it kind of funny. The one person who is amusing is Jennifer Tilly simply because of the rather drastic change she gives her character at the end.Simply put, this is a film that is inoffensive, has a lot of belly-laughs but not really memorable when the novelty has worn off.",7,0,1,27 September 2005
Man on the Moon," Carrey in his best role but what was the point?
","Jim Carrey can be the most funny person alive and the most scary. His high-octane performances are something that you just can't ignore and I'm talking of both his comic and dramatic performances.Like so many have commented on here is that Carrey is Andy Kauffman here, not just playing him. If you read my commentary on Taxi I was one of the people who didn't get Kauffman at all. He took risks of course but if you are to judge him from this movie you would come up empty. I know, that some would say that was the whole point but if you just wanna make a superficial examination of a person's character then you'd better make it a lot more entertaining than this. His start at the comedy clubs as it is shown here are highly suspect of course but why would any agent sign him on the spot without much to go on. His act can only be described as juvenile and maybe I'm wrong but agents are not that undiscriminating. There had to be more to him.The decision to play out Kauffman's acts as simply elaborate hoaxes may be brilliant but it gets rather tiresome after you have seen it two or three times and it is done to death in this movie. It's not that I mind being tricked but it just leaves a bad taste in your mouth to see that Kauffman cared more about himself than his audience and we are supposed to think that he was great because of that. The Bob Zmuda character is also a big problem. Many times I think of him as just a figment of the imagination, much like Kauffman's alter ego Tony Clifton. He doesn't seem to be that important to Kauffman, neither as a friend or a co-conspirator. Then we have Courtney Love's character, Lynne. Total disappointment after her performance in The people vs. Larry Flynt. Maybe she just did this as a favor to Forman.The death of Andy Kauffman was the most realistic part of the movie and the rather touching scene between De Vito and Carrey at the end is Oscar material. But doing a series of skits that are supposed to be a biography of any man's life is not what I would have preferred to see. Maybe someday they will finally give us a worthy biopic of say another actor like Bogart but even a mediocre one would be much more entertaining than this one.",2,4,7,24 March 2005
Good Will Hunting," Amidst a flow of sensational movies, this stands out as one I can hardly remember
","1997! What a great year for movies. There was Men In Black, one of my absolute favorites. As Good As It Gets, The Full Monty, L.A. Confidential and I know I am forgetting at least another 10 great titles. And this one. I am not including Batman and Robin and Titanic for obvious reasons.What I remember, is that I never thought that a story, that may sound extremely ordinary when summarised, could be so fascinating to watch. Here were these, at the time, totally unknown guys, and a director, that had done mostly obscure projects, at least outside of the U.S., could get so much done with so very little.So, if I can't remember the particulars of this movie, it is because I haven't seen it since it came out on video (not DVD), since it hadn't been introduced yet. That's why I am not giving a rating on this title.When the Academy Awards show came along, you sat up and took notice. What a memorable speech from those guys. That's what I remember the most. Also, the Robin Williams speech, where the tears almost overflowed through the small screen.Since then, I thought about seeing it one more time, but I think that it would have been redundant. You couldn't get the same vibe as the first time you watched it.",Null,0,2,6 October 2010
Schindler's List," One of the greatest films of the 20th century
","You can't really find anything that is as powerful, thought-provoking and tragic as seeing this superb film from the director, often accused of dealing with more flashy projects. Even so, as tragic as the subject matter is, it is not a depressing film.We see Oskar Schindler (a brilliant performance by Liam Neeson), con man and war profiteer. He likes the finest things in life (good wine, women and most of all money) but a metamorphosis occurs where he simply doesn't care about any of it and loses everything in order to save his workers, who happen to be Jews. He is himself a member of the Nazi party.On the other hand we have Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes in a part that defines evil), the ruthless leader of the death camps where Jews are killed left and right, simply to terrorize the living Jews who mistakenly believes that the Nazis operate logically. He is stupid, alcoholic and a miserable human being. Fiennes plays his part with absolutely no redeeming qualities and the scary part is that you can't figure him out. A bizarre sequence between Schindler and Goeth illustrates this point, where Schindler tries to explain true power. We think that Goeth will take the advice of Schindler, only to learn that Spielberg goes the other way. Quite schocking.Both Schindler and Goeth pay for their actions and you can't really say that either of them is a hero or a villain. Spielberg doesn't want us too root for anyone, he mainly shows us what happened. Of course, many people consider Schindler a hero but Liam Neeson never plays the hero. He simply seems to have lost interest in all what he held dear in the beginning.What is so fascinating about this movie is hard to explain. It doesn't have one glamorous moment and there are many horrifying scenes. Maybe it's this: It's a depiction of triumph of the human spirit (sounds cliché, doesn't it?) but it is nevertheless true.",10,9,13,15 December 2008
The Incredibles," The Pixar animation continues to dazzle you and the scripts are pretty good too
","What and idea! What happens when a superhero gets obsolete and becomes domesticated. This is the theme of this Disney/Pixar animated movie and the premise is nothing short of brilliant. Although, there are thousands of people working on this kind of movie, the major credit only goes to one person, the director Brad Bird. Bird was a consultant and sometimes director of the Simpsons but you can't really compare the two.The voice cast is a little unusual this time. Although Holly Hunter is very famous here in Denmark, Craig T. Nelson is practically unknown to many, at least if you haven't seen the dreadful films like Troop Beverly Hills or Action Jackson. Usually, Disney get the big stars to do voice-overs but I think it was a refreshing change to have a voice that was not immediately recognizable. The children are also great and the voice of the little old lady reminds you a little of Linda Hunt (the weird little dwarf who got an Oscar for playing a man).But as many Disney films the story could not exist without top-notch animation and this movie delivers in spades. It is the most visual dazzling spectacle to this date and where Dreamworks animation is not at all bad either, there is something spectacular about Disney as it always has been. Maybe it's because Disney and especially Pixar uses screamingly bright colours whereas Dreamworks' are more muted. All this goes at an agonizingly fast pace, the fastest yet and the puns and innuendos come fast and furious. This was by all means a well deserved Oscar-winner and I don't think it will be the last. I have seen the trailer for 'Chicken Little' and it looks much more simple but with Disney you can never tell.",10,0,0,19 August 2005
22 Jump Street," Offers very little fresh material
","Though I liked the performances of Tatum and Hill (they have really great chemistry), it really feels like more of the same as in the first film. There is also a really tired bro-mance plot that really outstays its welcome in the first 30 minutes. It's like they recycled the plot for I Love You, Man but with more shooting.Also, there are tons of actors who are wasted in cameos and small supporting parts only so we can recognize them and say: 'Oh, they got Richard Grieco to participate' or 'Look! There's Nick Offerman again.'There is one hilarious scene involving Tatum having a grand time about a twist involving Hill and the captain. It just seems like a little too much like sitcom style humor.So, there is not much to recommend here, although I did like the end with all of the fake sequel titles.",4,1,2,22 May 2016
Cars 2," Same problem as with the first film
","Cars no. 2? Not great. Pixar has been able to top itself time after time but this is a little step backward.Not that it doesn't entertain and the animation, while not sensational is crisp. The main problems are the characters and the story. Having an accidental spy plot is always dangerous ground. Many have tried and failed (The Man Who Knew Too Little or The Man With One Red Shoe), dismal failures in the careers of Bill Murray and Tom Hanks respectively. Those plots are basically repeated here and only slightly improved.The gags are also extremely weak. Lightning McQueen is made a supporting character while Mater takes the lead. Because of that, slight alterations are made to his character but they are alas not that interesting. A mortal sin is having Michael Caine in a totally straight part which doesn't even have a hint of self-referential acknowledgment.As mentioned before, the story is simply not compelling and there are too many stereotypical characters. To make them into talking cars doesn't make them less of a cliché.Don't take what is written deter you from watching it, though. There are still enough to enjoy but if you are a die-hard Pixar follower, you will be disappointed.",4,0,1,22 November 2011
Men in Black II," Smith & Jones try their best but the chemistry between them is sorely missing
","Not the worst sequel but any time you have seen a good movie and get disappointed by a sequel it's a bummer. The reason why the first movie was so enjoyable was because of the repartee between Smith and Jones. Here the limits of the plot requires them to have little screen time together and when they do share scenes they are usually engaging in a fight for the upper hand. J (Smith) believes that he is now the no. 1 agent but when K (Jones) gets in the game again he is bested until one particular scene involving a fight to beat the clock once again.As for the Alien scum, this time one of them comes in a more attractive package than the rather nauseating bug in the first part. Lara Flynn Boyle may look good but she is definitely in the wrong movie. She is absolutely no fun as the villain and her annoying sidekick, played by Johnny Knoxville is a waste of screen space.That said, the K character does show a little of the old spunk in the mail room scene but it is quickly turned into a rather lame pun on mailmen in general. The new addition, Rosario Dawson is somewhat charming but she is simply used as a cog in the plot machine. The Z character does an imitation of Yoda in a totally ridiculous fight scene and that's about it.The Men in Black are probably but a distant memory by now but back in '97 it was something else. There will probably not be another sequel and that's as it should be because what more could you do.",3,1,2,17 September 2005
Rules of Engagement," Can you forget the (too many to mention) plot holes? Not really. Still, Jones and Jackson are great
","I had wanted to see this because of the two stars Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L. Jackson and their first, and as far as I can tell, only collaboration.Tommy Lee Jones plays very much against type as a man consumed by guilt and with a serious inferiority complex. He plays it just as well as some of his baddies, like the Joker or Clay Shaw from JFK. Jackson and Jones (or as they are named here, Childers and Hodges) served in Vietnam together, and while Childers continued to serve in the field, Hodges was put behind a desk. This sound like a grade Z cop flick, doesn't it? What to remember is that neither of them feel good about what they are doing.All I can say is that I was very puzzled by it the first time I saw this. This is definitely a film you have to see more than once. The actors make it what it is. The film, as mentioned by others, isn't that logical. I couldn't figure out how an incident could be handled the way it is shown here. Particularly, the tampering of evidence, which seems to be just swept under the carpet without anyone questioning what happened, except Hodges.Anyway, logic is thrown out the window but this is still worth watching just to see Jackson and Jones together. The fight they have is really, really hilarious, yet still kind of disturbing. Jones delivers a closing that is both touching and believable. How could anyone find Childers guilty after that? Even to save their own behinds. The movie should have ended right there. Instead we get an epilogue where we see that all the guilty get what's coming to them.",5,0,1,11 May 2011
Guardians of the Galaxy," I don't know where to look
","This is an impressive film, not just the visual effects but the intelligent screenplay that goes along with it.I am not familiar with the source material but fortunately director James Gunn sets up the universe nicely in about the first 30 minutes of the film (in more ways than one).Chris Pratt was a good choice for the lead and he obviously has comedic timing from his work on Parks & Recreation. He must have worked extremely hard to get in shape so I'll give him a gold star for that.If there is a problem with the show, it's over-length and so many speaking roles, that you have to see the movie at least three times to get it fully. That's a minor fault, though and for the most part it is totally worth its running time. It borrows from a lot of different genres but the main one is oddly enough family drama.Here are my favorite moments/characters:1) The slave girl is hilarious. Pity she is taken out so quickly.2) Groot is an absolutely amazing character. He has so much personalty even though he can't really converse. The absolute favorite scene is when he kills 10 or more bad guys and gives the goofiest smile to the camera.3) The incredible space battle near the end. The visual effects in this sequence are absolutely stunning.There are a lot of other good moments but I just wanna list a few bad ones as well.1) Ronan is incredibly stupid. The way he just let the good guys get away with stuff is a little bit annoying and will of course lead to his defeat.2) Djimon Hounsou's eyes. This is the most annoying of the visual effects. It was probably how the character looked in the comic book, but it hurts 'my' eyes to look at them. Also, his character is a little underdeveloped for people unfamiliar with the source material.Otherwise, I think it's the best Marvel movie so far, even outdoing Spiderman. The use of pop songs are also inspired and to tie it with the plot is unusual.Note: Watch Cinema Sins commentary on this flick. I laughed my lungs out.",9,1,4,8 July 2015
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Divided
","Not as good as I thought it would be. I, like many others, is a great admirer of Tim Burton's work, but he does seem to have problems with telling a story outright and leave it at that.First off, I am not that big a fan of either the '71 version or musicals in general. And to make a movie like this, you have to have an angle to improve it. I wish they would have made this without the musical numbers. I agree with many on this page, that the songs serve very little purpose other than giving Danny Elfman and his band some clout. They are very well produced, but they are distracting and are not that memorable.I am also fond of Johnny Depp but I think he hits the wrong note. I was actually quite sick of this creepy character about halfway through the movie.There are some good moments and I especially loved the relationship story between Charlie and his grandfather. Remember the drunk contractor from Fawlty Towers? This is him. Unfortunately, the character development takes a backseat, while the obnoxious other children are dealt with. It adds some darkness to the plot but is not that interesting.I don't know. I kept hoping it would get better and it never rose above anything than a mildly amusing experience with a lot of creative set decoration. Nothing more.",5,3,6,21 May 2011
A Bug's Life," A not so perfect interpretation of the old grasshopper and ant tale
","Pixar's computer animation is of course top of the line here and in every movie they made to this date. However, the story this time is a little too bland this time to really involve an adult viewer, whereas kids below the age of 10 will probably eat it up. Flik, as voiced by Dave Foley, is just too darn nice and to make him an outcast because he is the most accident-prone ant in the colony will probably strike a chord with a lot of us but it doesn't really make the character funny. All of Pixar's character's from Woody to Mr. Incredible have many quirks but both Flik and the ant princess Atta (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) are too 'normal'.Things pick up a little after Flik goes on his journey outside the colony where he meets the circus bugs but the circus setting in a bugs world has been done so many times that you almost wish that they had chosen a different setting (the factory like in Monster's Inc. could have worked). The misfit bugs are of course comedic distractions from the very real threat that hangs over the Ant colony, that of the abusive grasshoppers who intend to do terrible deeds if they are not given their ill-gotten food. By the way, the leader, Hopper, is the most terrifying creature in a Disney film yet and his ultimate fate (minor spoiler) will probably frighten some kids. The voice of Kevin Spacey was a real surprise because he expresses more emotion here than he usually does in his live-action roles. The less said about Richard Kind the better.When you compare this to the other Ant movie that year, I will say that this is superior in the animation department but as many Disney ventures it is too darn cute this time. Check out the baby bug who believes in Flik like nobody else does and of the circus bugs only the ladybug, voiced by Denis Leary and the Stick by David Pierce are truly original characters.So a good time if you have kids but to teens and singles there are not much to offer, except seeing spectacular animation.",5,0,1,4 September 2005
The Insider," Mann directs his most accomplished movie and to this day it is the most unique.
","Few screenwriters could have come up with a better idea for a fictitious movie than this fact-based drama. Excellent performances laced with a splendid editing job that makes the film all the more alive and exciting. Plus the musical score is truly unique.Russell Crowe, in his first Oscar-nominated role gives a very low key performance reminiscent of his work in L.A. Confidential. Not that those two movies were anywhere near similar, but Crowe has a way of understatement in both films that is rare for an actor today. To compare, look at Al Pacino's performance. He has the flashy role of the TV-producer and boy, does he ever take advantage of it. The only times when he shows near restraint is in his scenes with Crowe. The scenes they share also has some touching moments and Pacino has never been more likable. The one thing that Pacino totally nails is the opening scene where he interviews the Arab (I forget what he is). You believe that he really is a news producer in the way the scene is set up and the way Pacino plays it.There are many more familiar faces throughout, but the one who truly made an impression is Bruce McGill in the rather small role of Wigand's attorney. The way he comes off as a good IL' boy when interviewing Wigand and the way he turns it around is pure gold. There are other small roles throughout by good actors like Debi Mazar, Stephen Tobolowsky and even a cameo by one of the real live persons who was involved in the case. Christopher Plummer as Mike Wallace does a good job but somehow he comes off as a bit of an oath. We never see why he was such a good host on 60 minutes.One thing I think was a bit disappointing was the way the focus shifted from Wigand to Pacino's character, Lowell Bergman. By the end I had enough of Pacino's turn as the wronged producer who turns it all around in his favor. In one scene we see Wigand at a job interview for a teacher position but we don't see why the principal, who had doubts hiring him, changed her mind. We also are denied a closing scene of how Wigand reacted when the piece of his interview finally aired in it's full form. Those are minor quibbles though, as I think that Mann keeps the integrity of the story on a high level through most of the film and it was a shame that it was so snubbed by the Academy but a little thing called American Beauty was apparently more attractive at that time.",8,1,2,29 March 2005
The Dark Knight," Had very mixed feelings about it but still, not easy to dismiss
","This is a very twisted film. Yes, it's far better than the campy franchise of the Batman tale that Joel Schumacher churned out, but the movie has a decidedly downbeat spin on the Dark Knight and also its villains.Here we really feel that being Batman is a curse, something that was sort of explored in Batman Forever. It is also weird to see something that is essentially pure fantasy turned into something so close to realism.The message of the picture is pounded in your face. On one hand you get pure evil in the form of the Joker, played to exhaustion by the late Heath Ledger, but as the plot moves on, we are lead to believe that given the circumstances all people are selfish and could easily be every bit as evil as the Joker.That evil is rubbed off on Harvey Dent, aka Two-Face. Aaron Eckhart almost puts Heath Ledger to shame as the crusading district attorney. Sorry, that his character explores only the dark side of his face.One thing that did bother me was Rachel Dawes. Please forgive me but what happens to her didn't really feel as a big loss. But for plot purposes it was a great twist. I also missed Michael Caine, he was hardly present in the movie or for that matter, neither was Morgan Freeman.As for Christian Bale, he handles Batman's conflict pretty well. Bruce Wayne's fate is wisely downplayed because we all know by now what he is and which one of the characters knows who he is.So as far as the plot goes, very hard to sit through but the drama is excellent.",7,1,10,12 August 2008
Men in Black," Who has seen this and not liked it? Not anyone I know
","What can you say except 'Bravo!' Not that this movie is swarming with eyeopener visual spectacles, most of the action is not set in space, but it's the general good feeling you get from watching two superb actors make a hell of a good team. Tommy Lee Jones may not be the biggest star on this planet but he knows how to recite a line that will crack you up, even though the line is never meant to be funny.Will Smith makes his perplexed average guy all his own and it is hard not to like him. It is rare that we see an African-American not playing a gangster become popular but Smith acts in mostly family friendly films. He had a very good couple of years, first with the all-star spectacle 'Independence Day' and shortly after this less overblown showcase. Too bad that he has stumbled (not counting his Oscar nomination for Ali) with such boring films as I, Robot and Wild, Wild West.The rest of the cast is also superb with Rip Torn as the rather stuffy chief of the MiB and Linda Fiorentino as a coroner who seems to enjoy her work a little too much. It is strange to think that she and Smith both being attractive people don't seem to have any social life. The K character had a lost love but the movie luckily sticks to the main plot and doesn't give us that much of a back story to it's demise.As for Vincent D'Onofrio, he must have had a terrible time doing this in the rather disgusting make-up job he is given but he was never much of a glamour boy to begin with (Smith jokes about this in one scene as well). He must have done this for the money.To sum up, this is a treat and repeated viewings doesn't make this any less of a good time.",10,1,2,16 September 2005
Alice in Wonderland," Once again, a near-success from Burton
","Great production design, a mildly amusing Johnny Depp and the most mainstream storyline that I have ever seen in a Tim Burton film to date. As you can tell, I am totally divided as whether I thought this was a good or a bad day at the movies.The good news is that I thought that Johnny Depp did nicely. Not entirely up to par with previous characters, but at least he wasn't as creepy as the Mad Hatter, as he was as Willy Wonka. The bad news is that the story and most of the characters just doesn't have that kind of odd whimsy, usually found in Tim Burton's work. Everything is kind of watered down so as to not totally freak out mainstream audiences, particularly the kiddies. Also, there is kind of a moral to this film that I would have never expected coming from Burton.As for the animated characters, they were just not that much fun. I got a few chuckles out of the rabbit and the Cheshire cat but otherwise they are pretty much what you would expect from an ordinary animated film.Still, the film moves at a brisk pace and I can't say that I was totally bored, I just expected more. By the way, after Helena Bonham-Carter's fifth 'Off with their heads!', could you tell that it was supposed to be funny by then?",5,0,1,29 March 2012
Rio," The animation is nice
","I don't know why this just doesn't sit well with me. It has everything going for it, a spectacular setting, better than average voice acting and a smooth and well told story.Maybe, it is because after seeing about 10 or more of these animated tales, my standards are becoming too high. The story involving culture vs. nature has been told many times before and if you are going to tell it again, there has to be something more to it than that.The characters are for the most part pleasant, except for the two sidekick birds, voiced by Will I Am and Jamie Foxx. Not that there is anything wrong with having two jive-talking characters in an animated movie, but it has been done to death. It is nothing against the two performers, who do quite well.Normally, I am not a fan of animated musical numbers either, but luckily the songs here are snappy and doesn't take that much screen time. It is just that they are very similar to some I have seen in other animated features.So, on the positive, this is the by far the best animation from Blue Sky I have seen yet. The plot, while not seen for the first time, moves at a snappy enough pace. There just wasn't any Wow! moments.",4,0,0,14 January 2012
Groundhog Day," Not a slob movie like 'Meatballs' and not really 'Rushmore' but really something
","I have seen this many times and one thing I can say about Bill Murray is that he must have been kicking himself that he wasn't doing something like this much sooner instead of treading water through most of the 90's in such failures as 'Ghostbusters 2' and later 'The Man Who Knew Too Little'. Later he had a spectacular comeback in 'Rushmore' but if he had continued making this kind of fascinating films he could have eased his transition to 'exciting character actor' much faster.This is such a great premise: A man living the same day over and over again and to top it off, a day that he thinks is one of the worst days of his life. If the film had taken a direction in which the Murray character was a nice person it wouldn't have been as much fun as when we learn that he has contempt for almost everything in his life. This character is a variation on the character Murray played in 'Scrooged' but as we go through his transformation to 'nice' we sort of buy it this time. In 'Scrooged' the transformation was a lot more forced.Add to that, a brilliant performance by Stephen Tobolowsky as Ned Ryerson. It's hard to play annoying and still make it funny but Tobolowsky is a pure treat to watch here. And as the icing on the cake we get Chris Elliott in his least memorable performance and I mean that as a good thing. Andie McDowell is sweet and cute but she is totally believable as a character who doesn't have a clue about Murray's situation and still thinks that there is something familiar about the whole thing she experiences in this one day.I am not saying that this is a masterpiece but it is easy to see why the director Harold Ramis and Murray was such a great partnership. Ramis knows how to build a scene and he knows comedy. Still, the movie tends to drag in the scenes that are supposed to be serious and the movie kind of ends abruptly after Murray wakes op next to Andie McDowell. But this has absolutely been my favorite Murray film ever since I can remember. The groundhog is cute too.",8,0,1,5 January 2007
The Departed," A riveting gem. Scorsese scores with undercover drama which doesn't seem to be yesterdays leftovers
","This absolutely has to be the best film of 2006. I can't find any other that even comes close. Finally, after two rather disappointing Scorsese epics, we get this that rivals his masterpiece, Goodfellas.DiCaprio, possibly Scorseses favorite after De Niro is superb, although his accent goes in and out. The same with Jack Nicholson but other than that you can't find any faults with them. Matt Damon has the difficult task of being a villain without the flash that Nicholsons character allows, but he manages to be a smarmy little backstabber without straining too hard.Could we just see some more of this from one of the greatest filmmaker ever. Scorsese has been around for some 40 years now and with each of his films we see something a little bit different than the last time. Even though the undercover cop drama and the gangster film dates way back, you think you are seeing something totally new and innovative in 'The Departed'. And to praise Nicholson one more time (it can't hurt) he is absolutely terrifying and damned funny at the same time. De Niro, eat your heart out.",10,1,3,7 May 2007
Die Hard," Loud, wham-bam action thriller, oh and yeah it's pretty good too
","There can't be many people in the world who haven't seen this or at least heard how it influenced not only action films, but the whole way of making movies today.Before this, action films usually featured a kind of überhuman, who usually were out of step with everybody else. For the most time, Willis is portrayed as the common man who is put in extraordinary circumstances.Think back to Dirty Harry. Do you really think he would have a rapport with a guy named Al and have a jokey conversation about Twinkies? No way.What Bruce Willis did was outstanding. He brought this cocky, slightly egocentric character into a world of ghastly situations and through an enormous amount of struggle come out victorious - and still you believe that he would rather lay on the couch with a beer in his hand and the game on.As for villains, this has got to be one of the greatest ever put on screen. Alan Rickman, who was a complete unknown at the time, did a masterful job of playing this cool and ruthless sociopath. He doesn't have any redeemable qualities and still we kind of wish that he succeeds.I have not read the source material upon which this movie is based, but I doubt that it could have been 1/10 as funny, scary and exceptional as this was when it was first seen.Willis doesn't play this kind of character anymore. Even the recent Live Free and Die Hard had a much more tame McClane than the first three, but he has to be grateful that Die Hard happened to him. It made his career. Thank goodness or otherwise we might still see him playing an ugly wife beater like he did in one of his earliest appearances on Miami Vice.",8,1,3,9 February 2010
Psycho," The sex
","Off course, this is an awesome movie. Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins, sadly, never were given better parts. Leigh lived to be nearly 80 years old, so this part must have been somewhat of a annoyance to her. It probably didn't help that she had one of the most famous ex-husbands and daughters in the world. We all know what fate had in store for Perkins.Seen today, the movie is a bit tame and slow at times, but what it must have felt like for a 60s audience to see a film that was basically about sexual desires, although no explicit sex is shown. Look at one of the first scenes, where Marion is talking to an investor. He checks her out from top to bottom and makes an obvious play for her in full public. I can't recall I have ever seen such a scene from a movie that was made in the early sixties, and have rarely seen it in a movie made up and until 1966. The reaction from Hitchcock's daughter is also rare to see in a mainstream film from that time. She just treats it like it was something that happens every day. That was particularly unheard of during the rather strict 50s.More talk about sex. Janet Leigh in the white and black bra. I still don't know how they got that past the censors at that time. Hitchcock must have had an enormous field day with those shots. Also, the shots of Leigh's stand-in, where you actually see a very quick shot of breasts. Unbelievable. It's funny to dwell on this today where you can see pornography every minute of the day but for a 60s audience? That took a lot of guts to put that in.As for story, it is not the most original. Mamas boys were well depicted even to the point of insanity as way back as Jimmy Cagney's part in The Public Enemy. The execution, however, was of course something new. I do think my interest fell a little bit after Vera Miles comes on-screen. She is a good enough actress, but her part is thoroughly bland. So is John Gavin's, although he does match wits with Perkins in a rather smart scene at the end of the film. Martin Balsam as the private investigator is brilliant. In the scene with him and Perkins, you sense just how smart both of these people are. Perkins stumbles a bit in his testimony but doesn't really give the detective any conclusive evidence of guilt either. In a more mainstream film the detective would have been smarter than the crook.You could analyze this movie to death and many have. What you cannot do is diminish it's importance. Many barriers were broken in entertainment in the 60s and Pcycho is directly responsible for breaking down those barriers.",9,0,0,28 May 2011
War of the Worlds," Cruise surprises yet again
","I am more and more impressed with Tom Cruise. Sure, he may act a little odd sometimes, make that a lot, but his movies are almost always a treat to watch.The director, Steven Spielberg (you may have heard of him), shows that he can make a gritty, sometimes kind of disturbing film and totally omits any sentimentality. Even a relatively gruesome film like his Saving Private Ryan had a little bit of corn. This is ten times better than the interesting, but way overblown, Minority Report, also starring Cruise.Spielberg makes a wise decision to make this as different from other alien flicks, like Independence Day or even his own Close Encounters, by not romanticize anything about beings from outer space. The opening narration by Morgan Freeman says it all: The aliens are simply evil.The visual effects are simply incredible. Instead of making them kind of bright and pretty, Spielberg uses a lot of grays. The sound is pretty awesome too and quite frightening. This is as close to a horror film from Spielberg, the director, you will ever see. He produced a few.It loses a few points from greatness by showing the aliens. I think it could have been a lot more interesting if the threat was simply the tripods. Also, the surly teen son is something that could have been omitted as well. We pretty much know how it will go down. The daughter is amazing, though. It's kind of creepy how she can be so grown-up and still a child at the same time.Tim Robbins is pretty good, but doesn't really surprise. The surprise is what happens to his character and who is responsible for that. Pretty shocking.",8,1,2,22 April 2012
Wedding Crashers," Intriguing premise but crashes and burns badly after 5 minutes
","Owen Wilson, the man who has a nose resembling an intimate part of the male body, finally rids himself of a co-star that outshines him like Jackie Chan or his best buddy, Ben Stiller. It's rather unfortunate that the vehicle he's chosen is such a waste of a life.The overall idea of having two guys, the other being the rather intimidating Vince Vaughn, lie through their teeth to get laid and doing it at weddings, to which they are not invited smell great at the beginning but soon turn into a fume-infested stink fest and that's just at the start of the movie.The turning point is when we first meet Wilson's lady love. She is presented as such a cuddly, too good to be true, stand up babe, that when Wilson engages in a rather sappy first encounter talk with her, you know virtually everything that is going to happen next, including Wilson falling head over heels in love and that the two guys get to grow up mentally. One of the rather simple lessons in this movie is that Wilson and Vaughn are too old to crash weddings: (Quote (Wilson)): I'm still young.' (Some lady): 'You're not that young.'The supporting cast is what saves the movie from being a total bomb but is Christopher Walken really that hung up for work that he wants to play a role mimicking Robert De Niro's in Meet the Parents. His Father of the Bride (another movie rip-off) is so hard-nosed at the beginning but soon falls into the same 'go with what makes daughter happy at the end.'The obstacle, of course is a psycho boyfriend who we know will get shafted by Wilson and Vaughn right when we first meet him. The sister, who Vaughn is forced to couple up with was the one decent surprise. The actress who plays her seems like ten fingernails scratching a blackboard but she wins you over like something that is very nice to have around. The less said about Jane Seymour's rather embarrassing bedroom scene the better and that goes for the brother's as well.So to sum up Wedding Crashers is a glass of fresh milk that gets tepid the more you leave it out of the fridge and leaves you with a sour smell and bitter taste, but nice try Wilson. Hope in the future you will return to supporting parts where you are best suited.",2,10,20,28 July 2005
Edge of Tomorrow," More Paxton, please
","I have become a little disenchanted with movies of the 2010s, especially these summer popcorn movies featuring aliens and tons of CG. I knew I had to see this because it starred one of my all time favorites, Tom Cruise. I think he gets unfairly judged as a movie actor because he is a star (plus he is kind of weird).Anyway, I hoped that this flick was in the style of the excellent remake of War of the Worlds, coincidentally also starring Cruise. When I saw that they ripped off Groundhog Day, I was really let down. Luckily, I perked right up again very quickly. Yes, they do use the basic premise of that classic but this is much more than trying to find a gimmick for what is essentially something we seen a thousand times before: Man vs. Alien.Let me get to my favorite part which is the performance of Bill Paxton. It's the first time that he and Cruise have worked together, as far as I know and I can't believe they have such good chemistry. Every scene they are together is pure comic gold. I wish that they had a little more screen time as a pair because after Paxton is gone, the movie takes a more tedious turn. Not that it gets boring but I don't think that the scenes between Emily Blunt and Cruise are that interesting. I was thoroughly disappointed when she shows up on screen. When she appears and is killed, I knew that it wasn't the end for her. Wouldn't that have been a cool twist, though. No, no. We can't have that.Fortunately, we are spared the traditional love story but the movie gets bogged down in the scenes with her, Cruise and that annoying scientist. I don't know how he figured out how the alien could be defeated and the plot doesn't allow a thorough explanation.Now for the worst part. The ending. Cruise loses his powers and has to convince his comrades to go fight this thing. The movie cheats by having them convinced in a matter of minutes but that's not the biggest problem. There are continuity problems as well. Again, I can forgive that. But when those black eyes appear again, I thought to myself: 'They screwed up'. I you haven't seen the movie, judge for yourself.Anyway, my rant is over.",9,0,1,5 July 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," Scorsese does a remake
","I am sorry to say that Scorsese finally made a terrible mistake. He went ahead and made a remake of his two previous masterpieces, Goodfellas and Casino and sort of made fun of himself, which could have worked, but comes awfully close to failing. Explanation: The movie has very little to say, other than there are people who think it's fun to be bad guys.Let me also point out that although the movie feels like a Scorsese movie, there is not that immediate sense of emotions that you almost always get from a Scorsese film. Here it almost feels like Scorsese is saying, well I finally won on Oscar, so to hell with all you. The movie almost feels like a big wind up with no release.There is an appalling amount of scenes that go on forever until I finally said to myself, enough already. It starts almost at the beginning, where we are introduced to Matt Mcconaughey. It's an inspired bit of casting and you have got to admire him for sending himself up as really weird. But as the scene goes on it, it goes on and on. Another one is where DiCaprio is giving his pep talk. It reminds me of the speech from Glengarry Glen Ross, just stretched out endlessly.But enough. I don't want to trash Scorsese, because he is the most influential filmmaker in the world. Let me put it this way: Nice try, but you have to make a story that's different the next time.",4,0,2,13 September 2014
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Really well constructed and great chemistry between the two leads
","When I heard about Die Hard with a Vengeance coming out and heard that Samuel L. Jackson was gonna be in it, I was thrilled. I had just seen Pulp Fiction and the expectation to see two of the stars of that brilliant film interact was almost too good to be true.Jackson and Willis do not disappoint. Their verbal sparring is hilarious and the writer of the script made a wise decision on making Jackson the smarter character. The only scene that I thought was a bit of a letdown comes in the middle of the film where Willis and Jackson have an argument about racism. What is that? Are they trying to prove that all people are racists underneath it all or did the writer think it was funny? Either way, it's not funny and it doesn't prove a point.Never mind. Most of the rest of the movie is a joy, fast paced and entertainment in its highest form. Credit must also go to Jeremy Irons who made an interesting villain, although a bit cartoonish. The sex scene with him and the female villain, Sam Phillips is too ridiculous to be sexy. I suspect, it was thrown in because the director thought it was necessary to show a little skin. There isn't really a female character with a strong part, and we all know why Sam Phillips' character had to be silent. Even so, the sex scene offers nothing but a cheap laugh.The action scenes are pretty believable, except for a couple of scenes involving a truck in an aqueduct and the scene where the villains make their getaway. To have one scene after that was a bit redundant and made the film drag on a little long but I guess they had to make time for McClane say his famous catchphrase.Beware! If you saw the most recent Die Hard (Live Free and Die Hard), Die Hard with a Vengeance has much more hardcore violence, but the violence is so over the top and cartoony that you don't really think that it is that shocking if you have seen the other Die Hard movies.If they decide to make another Die Hard bring back the character of Zeus. I was a little disappointed that Samuel L. Jackson didn't at least have a cameo in the 4th movie. Maybe you can't use him in a movie rated PG-13.",7,0,0,4 August 2008
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Pretty low, even for a movie which is supposed to be lowbrow
","Don't really know how to describe this but what a waste of time. Ferrell has surprised me with good parts in Austin Powers movies and the hilarious Zoolander. This would have been a great part for the late, great Phil Hartman, who I would have love to have seen in this role. Just imagining what he would have been able to do with it makes it all the more sadder that he is no more.Ron Burgundy, the anchor man Ferrell is portraying is in Ferrell's own words, kind of dumb. That would not make the movie dumb in itself but Ferrell makes the awful mistake by letting the character too aware that he is dumb. He should have been oblivious to the fact most of the time. Christina Applegate's character is even worse because we know by now that there has to be a virtually straight man/woman to comment on the dumbness of Burgundy but she ends up looking much more ridiculous than Burgundy at the end. The only one who sort of goes unscathed is Steve Carell, who may be playing the most stupid character in the movie but does it with such a straight face that he plows right over Ferrell in every scene he's in. He is fast becoming the absolute no. 1 comic actor today.Then of course you have the usual cameos by Ferrell's cronies like Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller but they don't amount to much. They are there absolutely for show.The one scene that did crack me up was when Ferrell and Applegate throw insults at each other during the closing credits and look like they have a professional conversation. That was a brilliant little scene and I wished that 'Anchorman' could have had that kind of edge right through it all.The end is sort of a cross between the end of 'Animal House' and the awful last scene of that Adam Sandler favorite 'Anger Management'. I heard that this film was in part inspired by a true event concerning the first female anchor. It must have been a very small part.",2,31,59,13 October 2006
American Gangster," Scott doesn't bring anything new to the already over-exhausted genre
","Really disappointing. I am not a fun of most of Ridley Scott's movies. I thought Blade Runner, although a triumph in stylish production design was a very dull experience. Gladiator had the same problems, although Joaquin Phoenix and Connie Nielsen gave excellent performances. The best film of his is one of his most mainstream, Thelma & Louise and it is vastly overlooked today as a great achievement in both story and eerie, almost ghoulish style.I have to be very careful here because I know that in each of his films there are commendable elements and the same applies here. I don't know if it's the jumping back and forth between the two main characters or if it was the storyline of the Vietnam connection. It seems like we are being taught history instead of being absorbed in the story.The plot keeps the two main characters apart for most of the running time, maybe trying for a Heat-like approach. The problem is that as individual characters they are totally uninteresting (a fact made even more sad when you think of the caliber of the actors, especially Russell Crowe). A subplot about Crowe's character is totally unnecessary and could have been cut right out without an audience noticing.Denzel Washington is supposed to be charming and dangerous at the same time but doesn't really succeed. There are several gap in his storyline (mind you I have not seen the director's cut). He virtually goes from nothing to a big shot in 2 seconds.At last, Crowe and Washington's big scene together at the end. It seems false, smarmy and you can almost see the winking at the audience. Okay, maybe that's exaggerating but if Scott was trying to emulate a similar scene in Heat, he failed immensely. The epilogue tells what later happened to Frank Lucas, and at that point I thought: 'Who cares?' The story was uninteresting so why make a point of showing that it was actually based on real people.",5,0,1,20 November 2008
Hancock," Dunno. Could have been better
","Extremely uneven, but brave attempt at retooling the superhero genre. Will Smith, does an admirable job of playing an essentially unlikable character and still have people rooting for him. It's just that his character isn't entirely fleshed out.Instead, we get a somewhat half-baked attempt at giving the character some back story through Charlize Theron's character. We know that something is up the minute she lays eyes on Hancock, and we are intrigued and I must say that I was shocked by the incident where the plot thickens.Unfortunately, after we get 'some' exposition that relates the characters, the story really goes nowhere. After that, the screenwriters sort of ran out of inspiration. We have the ultimate showdown between good and evil and then a lame epilogue.I will say, that the first hour or so is great fun and I think that the fact it comes way short of great or even quite good is a real disappointment.Oh, I forgot Jason Bateman. His character is very nice.",5,0,3,15 May 2010
WALL·E," How could it not win the Academy Ward?
","I think that it was obvious that this almost perfect animated feature would win the Academy Award. The competition that year was Bolt and Kung Fu Panda. Many were probably amazed that Panda didn't win, but I thought that that particular movie was a little too much premise (Panda doing Kung Fu) and not enough story.Everything is near perfect here, the story, the animation, yes, even the voices. Don't be fooled by the marketing. This is not a silent film, although much of the first half have very little dialogue.Since everybody is familiar with the plot at this point, it would be a serious waste of time to recap it. Wall-E, though an almost silent character, is perhaps the richest, most expressive character in years, in animated or live-action films.Props also to Jeff Garlin, the human who discovers the truth about Earth's atmosphere. He has always been one of my favorite actors, although most of his work has been in lousy sitcoms.The way the humans are designed is of course brilliant and fits nicely into the story. What else could you do if you were stuck in a situation like this? It is not grotesque and it shouldn't offend anybody.So, after a couple of years of being screwed out of awards, (Happy Feet? Winner of 2007? What the hell was that?) Pixar is finally recognised as no. 1 once again. Don't get me wrong. There is enormous talent in all the other studios, PDI, Sony and even Disney themselves, but nobody has reached Pixar's level of sheer masterful blending of all elements that make animated features so enjoyable.",9,0,1,2 May 2011
The Good Shepherd," Not easy to digest but almost worth the time spent watching it
","Not the all out spectacular must-see movie of the year 2006 and I was sort of disappointed because my hopes were so high when I heard that Robert De Niro was finally making a directorial sophomore effort. His debut as a director was the surprise of the year '93. Of course, it was a gangster film which was in danger of receiving undue negative comparison to the works of his mentor, Martin Scorsese, but De Niro made the wise decision to make the movie more like a fable than a hard edged drama like the works of Scorsese. If anyone hasn't guessed which movie I am talking about here it is: The totally brilliant A Bronx Tale.It's not that De Niro may have taken a project that was over his head but The Good Shepherd tries to be more ambitious than it really needs to be. It is obvious that facts were heavily researched but making a story that says that trust in Intelligence is very hard to come by and choosing country above anything else can be a lonely existence and then use a rather muddled narrative with about 50 flashbacks and forwards, is too much to swallow for the average movie goer.De Niro has a first rate cast but this time he uses them very awkwardly. Even such a talented actor like John Turturro, who almost never seems boring is completely wasted here. And Damon, what can you say. His character is such a shadowy figure that when he is finally put in a terrible dilemma, we don't much care anymore.Sorry, De Niro but I can't say that I enjoyed watching this as much as it almost gave me headaches trying to follow what was happening. Maybe that was the idea but it is in my opinion not a very good one.",7,0,0,12 August 2007
The Queen," God save the Queen. Mirren kicks major ass
","Very surprising. I wouldn't have thought that I would enjoy this so much. A potential snore was made one of the best views of 2006 by the two protagonists, wonderfully played by Helen Mirren and the relative newcomer, Michael Sheen as Tony Blair.The prologue, dealing with Princess Diana is ingenious. You are not really sure if you are watching a reenactment or archival footage of the paparazzi chase that would end in horrible tragedy.Then we get a marvelous scene where Blair and his wife are waiting inside the Palace. Blair is to be sworn in as PM. We already know that he is not too keen on the monarchy and actually thinks that it's a bit of a joke from a discussion between him and his wife. As they meet we immediately sense that although Blair would like to say that it is him that's in charge, the Queen immediately puts him to shame, not by being bossy but simply being such by he empowerment.Now we get to the real plot: How to deal with Diana's death and it is here the two personalities come to blows. And from then on it's Mirren's movie all the way. The Queen doesn't invite much sympathy but we start to understand her and why she acts like she does. When we finally get to the inevitable turnaround, we don't feel that Blair was more right because he finally won the Queen over, but we feel sadness because it really hasn't changed anything, except giving the people what they wanted.The epilogue is a scene reminiscent of the prologue, where Blair acts as he knows how to deal with the Queen but in reality he knows nothing more than he did before.The performances are all great and special kudos also to James Cromwell. He may be playing a totally foppish character but he does it brilliantly. Mirren's Oscar was totally deserved and Sheen almost channels Blair, even though their resemblance is only slight.",9,0,1,15 October 2007
Raging Bull," De Niro at his worst and also best.
","Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese together can only be described as the definitive symbol of cinematic excellence. They have a profound understanding of each other that everybody should aspire to, whether they're in show business or not.Raging Bull is the ultimate Scorsese/De Niro collaboration and the snub it got from the Academy was a grim reminder where movies in the 80's where headed. Instead of making more of these quality films together, Scorsese and De Niro were virtually absent in the 80's. It wasn't until '88 that De Niro made sort of a comeback with Midnight Run. Scorsese was producing a few films but he wasn't the major influence he had been in the 70's.The film Raging Bull also introduced Joe Pesci to a worldwide audience. He had only made an obscure film in the mid-70's which was virtually unseen except De Niro who recommended him to play Jake LaMotta's brother, Joey. Another newcomer was the actress playing Jake's wife, Vicki. She was barely out of high school when she was hired. This is by far, De Niro's absolute best performance and of course he also won the Oscar, but it is also the performance that is the hardest to watch. Every single moment he's on screen is like spending time with your worst enemy. He is such an ugly person that you can't sympathize with him at all. The thing that makes him somewhat redeemable is that he never thinks of himself as a good person. He knows, he is trash but the power to change is not in him. At the end, where he tries to make up with his brother is the most painful moment ever filmed and there doesn't seem to be any change in his character. Apparently, the real LaMotta saw the whole film and was himself disgusted of the way he was portrayed but only at himself.De Niro has had a long career and he is always worth watching but in this film I must admit that he gave me the creeps from start to finish. Even his role in Cape Fear wasn't as disturbing as this one. So did it deserve to win the Oscar for Best Picture. Yes it did but not because the story is really compelling. It deserved to win because every minute of the film you feel something, even though it's mostly bad feelings.",9,2,2,25 March 2005
The Dark Knight Rises," The Dark Knight Sinks
","Not really, but it's a little sad that Christoper Nolan's conclusion of the Knight Tales doesn't really deal with the Knight himself. Instead, there are an enormous amount of screen time for the mostly boring villain, Bane and for the first time, a really sappy subplot about Alfred and Bruce Wayne.Not that the movie isn't worth seeing. There is a surprise plot twist that absolutely threw me but there is an abundance of Bane tedium. It's like a really big wind-up that really has no resolution.To put it mildly, the relationship between Batman and Catwoman lacks any real relevance. It's like, she's just there because she was a character in the TV show, Tim Burton's film and then we have to have her in this one as well.Back to the good stuff. Christian Bale once again shows why he is an equal to Val Kilmer and Michael Keaton as both Bruce Wayne and Batman. (George Clooney still has the dishonour of being the worst of the bunch) and it is a little sad that he is basically a supporting character in this movie. There is also a nice turn from Joseph Levitt, even though his annoying accent is a major distraction. What is it? New York or Chicago. I can't tell. Gary Oldman is totally wasted, and not in the fun way.So, should you praise this show? A weak Batman flick from Nolan is still way superior to Joel Schumacher's abysmal Batman and Robin, but that is really just stating the obvious.",7,2,5,6 December 2012
Any Given Sunday," On any given Sunday there will be sold movie tickets. To this one I am not so sure.
","Oliver Stone was one of the major wheels in the film industry in the mid-80's but lately he has been more ridiculed, no doubt because of his political stance more than for his movies.This is the first film he's made that really has no real target, at least not if you are looking for something like a conspiracy thriller, which he of course is famous for. The theme is professional football but here his viewpoint is very hazy. Although, he shows us tons of despicable characters who are in the business end of the sport, they are really not more bad than the players who live for the sport.Al Pacino as the aging coach has a bravura opening moment where he chews his players out for stinking up the field. He is one of those actor who can make shouting the most hilarious piece of showmanship you have ever seen. Unfortunately, that is the climax of this movie. Form there we get a long boring story about how the coach is becoming obsolete, as is his star player, Cap (played by a sleepwalking Dennis Quaid). The owner of the football team (played by Cameron Diaz in a totally unsympathetic part) wants more sponsorship and is usually thinking of financial gain which disgusts the Pacino character. Despite this rather dry storyline there is a bright spot. Cap gets an injury and is replaced by a third-stringer named Willie (played by recent Oscar-winner Jamie Foxx). He makes a total ass of himself when he vomits on open camera in his first game but then the team wins and the coach and Willie are quick to think that it has something to do with the puking. Could there be any more superstitious twerps? This ritual is totally played for laughs by Stone and that is refreshing since he normally gets very dour and has a rather tepid sense of humour.Another actor who has virtually become a staple in Stone's films is James Woods and he chews up the scenery as a crooked team doctor but he is not really a major character in this film. Stone is more interested in exploring the age thing this time, not crooked politics. Too bad, because I was about to give the movie my full attention when he showed up on screen. The age thing also concerns the relationship between Pacino and Foxx, not that he is black as Foxx claims. He is arrogant, greedy and totally self-absorbed until he learns a lesson and then makes the usual 180 degree turn at the end.The football scenes are played out as noisy, confusing and violent extravaganzas and one would think that made it exciting. Not in my opinion but it is far better watching that than the interval scenes which bears little resemblance to anything than a session at a psychiatrist. I heard that Stone got scathing reviews for his epic 'Alexander' also but I haven't see that yet so I will simply say that Stone should have stuck to doing films about subjects nearer to his heart because the only thing we see here is an outsider who is more fascinated by the subject than knowledgeable.",2,1,2,3 August 2005
Iron Man," Low expectations saved this for me
","How many superheroes can filmmakers drain to absolute dehydrated shells? Look what happened to the Superman movies (5 so far counting the most recent waste of time) and the Batman movies (Also 5, if you don't count the recently yet un-released swan song of Heath Ledger). Actually, Batman was reinvigorated with a new innovative director, superb story and brilliant actors who saw its potential.The same could be said for this the latest installment of what could have been a massive bore. The director, Jon Favreau, who is also an actor, had the stroke of genius to cast Robert Downey, Jr. in the part of zillionaire tycoon, Tony Stark. Downey, while not playing himself, clearly put some autobiographical stamp on his part which fit the character brilliantly. Tony Stark is a middle aged man who seizes the chance to redeem himself after a frightening wake up call (cue Downey's sordid past). Favreau also cast Gwyneth Paltrow and for once her character didn't make me want to spew vile as other female characters have done in lesser superhero flicks (eg. Uma Thurman in Batman bomb + Robin). One minor quibble, her character must be the loneliest person on earth besides Stark himself. No clear motivation as how she is attracted to him other than that.Jeff Bridges acquits himself nicely, although it is never explained how he is able to be a threat to Iron Man (see the climactic battle if you don't know what I mean). Also his mumbling performance is a bit tiresome after a while.The CGI is of course top-notch and quite unbelievable (really, where can you get such a supercomputer, let me know). There is a clever little sequence while Stark is perfecting his suit that mirrors a scene seen in Disclosure. As for the action sequences they are not that interesting, except for a glorious dogfighting sequence.So I was only mildly interested in seeing it but once it was over I thought: 'It could have been better but not the mind blowing bore I thought it was going to be'.",7,3,6,10 May 2008
Bruce Almighty," Basically a repeat of Liar, liar but compared to the Truman Show quite enjoyable.
","Yes, Jim Carrey could probably act in this movie and sleep at the same time. He has played this character under different aliases so manny times that it seems that he just wanted to cash in his check this time. Maybe he was tired of being rejected by the Academy so many times that he just threw in the towel and said: 'The hell with it!'. Even so, this is a somewhat worthy effort. Bruce, as Carrey calls himself this time, would probably never get out of the rut he is in (much like Carrey's role in the Mask) if fate hadn't stepped in, actually the personification of fate, God. Somehow, we laugh more at people's misfortune than charm (think Homer Simpson, Al Bundy etc.). When Bruce gets the powers of God we are only slightly amused but kind of bored. I can't really speak for everybody but I think many will agree.The performances are what we expect in a movie like this, even Morgan Freeman gives a somewhat limited performance (congratulations on finally winning an Oscar). Jennifer Aniston is underused as Lisa Kudrow was in the two Analyze films. The one surprise is Steve Carell, who has a new show premiering tonight on US TV. In the scene where Carrey makes his usual grunt noises and makes them come out of Carells mouth, it's astounding how well they play together. I don't know how many times they retook this but it's the best part of the movie.The endless last 30 minutes seemed tacked on by Carrey himself to make some kind of statement to the audience. What a waste of film, we didn't want to see another retread of 'It's a wonderful life' for the umpteenth time and I think Carrey should stick to one formula at a time. The same happened in Liar, liar but they only wasted 10 minutes in that movie. I understand that Carrey had a new film in theaters with a serious role again. I can't figure him out but maybe i'm not meant to because then there would be nothing to write about him.",5,0,1,24 March 2005
Toy Story 3," How do they top themselves every time?
","It's incredible. The good folks at Pixar have done it again and made what would have seemed impossible. Made a sequel, that tops both number one and two.The question still remains: What good is a toy when there is no one to play with it? It was the recurring theme of both 1 and 2, but that would have been sort of boring to repeat, if the story didn't go in another way. It does and we get a great prison drama, adventure and even psychological thriller all thrown into one.The original characters are still here, even Slinky Dog whose original actor, Jim Varney, sadly died. But I think they found a suitable replacement in Blake Clark. There were times when I couldn't even hear the difference in their voices. Along with them are tons and tons of new characters and every single one is unique. They are too numerous to mention, but Ned Beatty's Lotso certainly stands out. I would say, that it is one of his greatest achievements and the guy has hundreds of credits. Also, props to Michael Keaton. He is one of the most versatile actors and can go from lighthearted comedy to extremely serious drama in a heartbeat. Here he does both.Speaking of drama, I was surprised how dark the back story of Lotso turned out to be. It's not for little kids but I doubt that it will disturb them. Still, it's nice to see that not all things of family entertainment have to be watered down.And how about that Buzz Lightyear. If you have seen the movie, you will laugh your head off at what happens to him. It's as close as annoying, but still funny as you get, and it is funny.You have to have a somewhat happy ending in a film like this but for once, it's a great one. It's strange to see something as realistic as this in an animated movie but it makes sense. Which proves that they don't just have great animators at Pixar, but also intelligent writers.There are not that many movies that I will give top grades but this one is close to perfect.",10,0,1,19 December 2010
Live Free or Die Hard," The novelty has worn off but it still excites and thrills more than most action films today
","Bruce Willis still has some life in him, as evidenced in this competent fourth entry into the Die Hard series. Long gone are the glory days where Willis' fish out of water act was new and thoroughly surprising but the movie still has the quality to entertain you.Much has been said about the movie's lack of the F-word to avoid it from receiving an R rating. It was as usual to gather a wider audience as was Martin Scorsese's The Aviator but it doesn't really make any difference. The movie still has virtually the same impact. The way, Samuel L. Jackson and Willis used every opportunity to wring out a laugh with the word in Die Hard with a Vengeanse was to be expected, following their part in Pulp Fiction, where Jackson made a contest out of how many times he could say it in one line. Plus, that film had a more strong villain in Jeremy Irons and he was mostly in on the joke. Just looking at Irons' character brought a hilarious disdain for the character he played in that movie.Here we have a much weaker villain, a computer expert (Gee, has that not been done before) and an even weaker side kick, Justin Long. But to my surprise, Long wasn't as annoying as he could have been and even got me somewhat involved in his destiny to save Washington D.C.As in past entries to the series, the villain's motivation is totally outrageous and selfish and doesn't have anything to do with destroying the world as we know it. The villain has an eastern sidekick and Willis makes some rather tasteless remarks about her race which I think was totally uncalled for. It is offensive and totally thrown in to get a cheap laugh from the audience. We must have somebody to ridicule so who do we go for, the foreigners whoever they are, be they German or Chinese or whatever. This is the only objection I have about the film and it pretty much soured my attitude towards the rest of it.Now on to what is good about it. Willis' stunt with a car flying to destroy a helicopter is the most spectacular piece of film trickery I have seen in years. It is obviously CGI but it still looks somewhat possible (not totally) but maybe. The end is also as it should be and Long has one of his best moments together with the actress who play McClane's daughter, without resorting to the obvious of a love scene.To sum up, it is nowhere near the level of the past three entries but you weren't totally dissatisfied to pay for an overpriced ticket to see Willis near-geriatric stunts towards crushing a bad guy (Sorry, Willis but you asked for it).",7,1,3,13 July 2007
Rear Window," This must have been a killer to make
","This is an excellent movie and I still don't know how Hitchcock was able to pull it off so well. Multiple sets on camera in the same frame and still not confusing or disjointed.It is also one of his most funny and entertaining pieces and that is another accomplishment given the dark subject matter. It could have been a morbid and nauseating film with the wrong tone but, he keeps it light and still doesn't lose a lick of the tension.There are so many scenes here that are aces but one favorite is when Jeffries' detective friend visits him to tell him that he is wrong in suspecting foul play. Several things goes on in the scene at once and it is so well written. The looks that Stewart and Corey give each other are priceless.Thelma Ritter as the nurse is brilliant and it's a shame that she wasn't really acknowledged more for the part. Grace Kelly was excruciatingly beautiful but you couldn't really see her as much more than that. She stopped acting before she developed into an accomplished actor. Her best scene is at the beginning when she realises that Stewart won't marry her.The best part is of course played by Raymond Burr and as was intended, he does resemble David Selznick. It almost creepy how much he looks like Hitchcock's boss. I wonder how Selznick took it. It is a very difficult part too, virtually silent and incredibly menacing.You could go on and on about the meaning of the whole thing. One thing comes to mind, though. This is a movie that virtually defines what a movie is. Perceptions, reactions, conclusions and all that defines great art. It's all here.",10,3,5,2 July 2011
The Truman Show," What was it all about? Only Weir has the answer.
","No phrase can really explain this movie. The idea of having a man grow up in a 50's sitcom-style universe without him knowing it and then show it as a TV-show 24 hours a day is a somewhat perverted idea but everybody in this movie seems to eat it up. It is not that I am against movies with questionable morals but it seems the situation the main character, Truman is in gives everybody some kind of unexplainable Ecstasy. They are almost slobbering at the screen and all they are really seeing is a person who does pretty much what we all do every day.It might seem like an odd way to start this commentary but I can't for the life of me think of a better way. This is no ordinary movie and the premise is somewhat unusual but still I don't know why it is supposed to be so brilliant. A man is followed around by cameras all day and night and doesn't know it. All well and good. But why does the he have to live in a totally artificial universe where everybody he knows is a fake? And why does Christof believe that he is God because he controls the destiny of one man? When Truman begins to suspect that something is wrong, Christof will destroy everything he has created to keep Truman in the universe which no longer exists because Truman has become aware of it.To say that this is a entertaining film would be stretching the truth. If it is an educational film it doesn't teach me anything. Am I supposed to think TV is bad? Please. Why use a movie then to teach the lesson. Am I supposed to think people are drones who follow every direction which is shoved down their throats? Then why sohw it in a movie which is supposed to sell tickets bought by the same people. All these questions and many more will probably not be answered by the filmmakers or anyone else in the next episode.",5,6,12,1 August 2005
The Matrix," A whole new way of movie-making
","There was not a single film that I can remember that was like this back in '99 and to say that the experience was totally awesome is an understatement.Before I saw this, I usually thought that sci-fi movies were dull. I was one of the few people who thought Blade Runner felt like an eternity to sit through. This was exciting from start to finish and if you have ridiculed Keanu Reeves in the past, the performance he gives here makes up for it in spades.The genius of the movie is of course that we don't know what is real or not and that include people. The men in suits and sunglasses are shown as ghost-like creatures who control what the commoners' environment but you are not really sure if they themselves are not controlled by another entity. The character of Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) seems to know all the answers but even his wisdom is questioned by his complete blind faith in Neo as the chosen one.There is of course obstruction from opposing sides in the form of Cypher (Joe Pantoliano) who thinks that it is better being in a make-believe world than to endure the rather meager existence the rebels are leading and he has a point.Millions of dollars were probably spent making this movie but except at the end all the money were well spent. The shoot-out is exciting up to a point but it is dragged out a little too long. That is such a minor quibble, though that you can easily gloss over it. So how can you top such a movie. My opinion is you can't as witnessed by the rather inferior sequels but there was a time when this all felt new and you should applaud the Wachowski Bros. for that and not gag because you just saw a spoof on the Simpsons for the 1 millionth time last night.",10,3,6,22 September 2005
Casino," Slow at times, but definitely worth watching.
","The opening narration of this epic tale pretty much sums it up. Ace Rothstein (based on real life casino owner Frank 'Lefty' Rosenthal) was a very gifted individual and the way the inner workings of a casino is described is fascinating to watch. However, the more the story unfolds we are banged over the head with numerous names, situations and too much narration that really isn't necessary to follow the story.There are other problems, especially regarding the Nicky Santoro character, played by Joe Pesci. There are conflicting information about him all through the movie. Was he a major figure in organized crime or was he simply a two-bit hood. It is never quite made clear but he must have had some connection since he gets in any casino before he is banned. The friendship between him and Ace is never really fully explored either. A background sequence could have saved the viewer a lot of confusion. As they are portrayed in this movie they don't even seem to be of the same species. The way Rothstein tries to cover up where he comes from is essential to the plot but that he behaves a lot more like a socialite than a gambler is too polished to be believable.The Sharon Stone character Ginger is the most fully developed person in the movie. Her character is pretty much revealed in the first two minutes she's on screen and the way she transforms during the movie is also believable. Even though her pimp, Lester (played by James Woods) doesn't have a lot of screen time, we can guess what purpose he had in her life. Therefore, it must have been hard to cast the Ginger role as her's requires a great deal of acting skill.Like so many actors Scorsese has worked with before, De Niro, Pesci and Frank Vincent does pretty much what we expect. They are all terrific but the real surprise is Alan King, who is a comedian. Even though his character is also a little sketchy, he brings the right kind of authority to his role. He is also the one character who gives the most information as to how things operate in Vegas.The bosses of Las Vegas are mostly decorative. They are never fully explored and are therefore mostly played as fat men in suits. The only boss who seems to have any say in what goes on is the character, Remo Gaggi, and even he seems to be clueless most of the time.There are a lot more to mention but the bottom line is that even though it is very clear that Scorsese has put a lot of effort into the accuracy of the action, it is a bit confusing and I think he should have left out a great deal of the narration that doesn't really explain a lot anyway. So an 'A' for the effort but only a 'B+' for the artistry which is what I think he is trying to aspire to.",7,1,2,28 March 2005
Heat," Mann, the TV producer who should be king.
","The first crime drama in history that shows both sides of the law without deriding one side or another is also the best Michael Mann film that he has ever made. The two antagonists are three-dimensional and Mann shows that he is more than what he has been accused of being, a director that prefers style over substance.De Niro and Pacino are of course two of the best actors known today, but they couldn't be in better company. Mann, who used to be producer of Miami Vice deals with each of their predicaments in a sensitive way that really describes what being opposites is really about.De Niro's character, McCauley and Pacino's Hanna actually have more in common than the people that are supposed to be their friends and allies. They have been unable to form a lasting relationship with women and their only satisfaction is their work.Of the many supporting players, two stand out. Tom Noonan is not a household name, especially here in Denmark, but his despicable character here is essential to counter what the De Niro character is like. Val Kilmer seems to be an odd choice to play a hardened criminal but he shows that he can be as hardboiled as De Niro could in his most unsympathetic role, especially when dealing with his girlfriend, played by Ashley Judd. She has an important part in the end where she has to choose sides.Like many crime pictures, there is a great shootout, but this one is handled in a way that doesn't spell attractive or glamorous. The noise is absolutely worse than any war picture ever made and the casualties die hard.The end is somewhat predictable but could it end in another way and still be believable? I don't think so. The two scenes that De Niro and Pacino share, including this one, are not really necessary to the plot, but they say something about their characters and their strange connection. That it is not two action scenes doesn't really matter because we have already seen the cat and mouse game they play before their first scene and to have them go head to head literally would spoil the poesy of these enigmatic characters. The one thing that I felt a little contrived was the way that Hanna approaches McCauley to have their talk but that is such a minor quibble that it doesn't affect the rest of the movie. So congratulations to Mann for making a brilliant film and I hope there will be many more to come.",9,0,1,27 March 2005
Fast Five," Now I have seen everything - wait... no I haven't
","This won't take a lot of words. Even crazier stunts than the previous installments, really silly dialogue and tired drama about family values. That's pretty much it.There are also an abundance of characters that are totally uninteresting and underused, just because the plot demands that they participate in the heist. I think that's the reason why the running time of the movie is 25 minutes longer than the others.We also get the most boring villain and a character from the first movie who is pretty stupid on the surface, but seems to think more logical than all of the other characters combined. Luckily, he gets a hero's send off. Oops! I gave away his demise. Sorry.This sequel is also the worst offender of setting up characters' point of view and then suddenly make them do 180s for no apparent reason. And to top it all of, it has the most ridiculous car chase in history which is pretty cool, but by then I pretty much lost interest in how it was gonna turn out. Also, you pretty much know that you can't have our heroes die or punished. So it ends pretty much how you expect.One thing also. Both Walker and Diesel look terribly out of shape. One scene has Diesel pulling up a wounded Dwayne Johnson and I kept thinking that he was gonna dislocate something. Anyway, my commentary is done. There is no point of giving out a rating but I'll give it a 2, just for the effort of giving us a car chase that you definitely haven't seen so much.",2,0,2,14 July 2015
Jackie Brown," Too straight forward but deserves some recognition
","Tarantino's follow-up to Pulp Fiction is a bit too ambitious to be a really enjoyable experience. There are individual moments that are priceless but all in all I was a bit disappointed.Things that work: Robert De Niro's performance as the world's dumbest criminal, Louis Gara. It is almost as if De Niro's part could have been played by Sylvester Stallone. In fact, De Niro and Stallone shared screen time in another '97 movie, Cop Land, where De Niro has a hilarious monologue belittling Stallone about just how dumb Stallone's character is. Funny coincidence, no? Samuel L. Jackson's chilling performance as Robbie. Gone are the humour that Jackson brought to his dread-locked philosophy spouting gangster in Pulp Fiction (still the mother of all Tarantino films), and say hello to a character that is almost as ruthless as Tony Montana. Jackson is steely cool.Things that should have worked but don't: Michael Keaton's character (usually one of my favorite actors, even in Herbie - Fully Loaded he is brilliant). Boring, because no character with high morals are any fun in Tarantino's movies.The same can be said about Pam Grier's and Robert Forster's parts. Although, Grier is certainly one of the hottest looking actors she too is no fun to watch. The romance between her and Forster is nice but nothing more? The best part: Bridget Fonda as perpetually stoned Valley girl. Brad Pitt's performance in True Romance comes to mind when watching her. And check out the sex scene between her and De Niro. Priceless.Oh, I almost forgot. Tarantino chooses to stay behind the camera this time. Does this redeem the movie in some way. Yes, and no. Tarantino is the worst actor imaginable but his ramblings are sorely missed because it gives his movies a feeling of joy. Here is a man who made his dreams come true and when you see him on screen, you can tell that he has a marvelous time.",6,2,3,30 September 2008
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Funny? Absolutely. Good? Very hard to say
","It is incredible hard to say if this film works or not. It is absolutely hilarious for the first 1/3 of the running time but then it kind of peters out at the end. That it was made on a shoe-string budget is clearly evident but that doesn't necessarily mean that it will be bad. Many of the million-dollar blockbusters made today are not worth 1/10 of their budget.As has been mentioned many, many times, the Pythons are extremely clever and creative writers and that was their forte in their TV show which we all know was a sketch show. When putting sketches on a feature and at the same time have a plot-driven story, one of the elements get compromised. As mentioned, the first 1/3 of the film does work because the Pythons successfully interweave the two elements. Then somehow the comedy goes flat. There are still a few funny bits but not that many.As mentioned on one of the commentaries on the DVD release, we learn that there was some conflict on the location shoot, especially between the actors and Terry Gilliam. Terry Jones took over some of the directorial duties, and sorry to say this, because Gilliam is a brilliant director, Jones has much more flair for comedy. Maybe that was why the film is so bi-polar.The Pythons play almost all the roles, but special mention must be made to Michael Palin and John Cleese who have the most outrageous characters (the knight, the taunter (Cleese) and the repressed peasant (Palin) - notice Palin in the dirt) Graham Chapman plays it straight and you have to admire that too. You could buy him as a legitimate character in one of these films set in medieval times. He was reportedly plagued by problems with alcohol at the time, but it doesn't show on screen.Why do I think this is a bad film? I don't. It has no point and that was the idea but as entertainment it is very uneven.",5,4,7,5 December 2008
Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted," A little of Column A and B
","This has to be the hardest movie to rate as either great or terrible. The good parts are so good indeed that you can almost forgive the bad, but not quite.Let's start with the good. A truly compelling take on an absolutely stale idea: Running away, or in this case becoming a circus. It totally mimics that old, old saying: You can't go home again. Here the twist is that none of the characters really gives a damn about the circus and are using it to get this: Go back and be another kind of performers, although using a lot less skill.Another positive: Ben Stiller really has made Alex the Lion his own. He totally nails it every time. Although, a lot of it is based on parts he has played before, he makes it so likableSorry to say that every single one of the other main cast are totally wasted. Somehow, they are totally written off as individuals in this one. Chris Rock's has only one scene to shine, David Schwimmer gets nothing and Jada Smith hardly has any screen time. They all get the same recycled material that may have worked 2 other times but totally falls on its face here.What does get a lot of attention are the new characters and some of them impressed. Bryan Cranston does a marvelous job as the tiger with the wounded ego and burned coat and Frances McDormand is of course amazing as the French Gendarme. But sorry to say, the action sequences with her are just plain ridiculous. Like the T2 in Terminator 2 only with less emotions.Of course, the animation is top notch all the way through and that's why it is so sad that the thing is so average anyway. Also, there are way too much emphasis on making the whole thing look as cool as possible to please teens and tweens. Also, the music numbers are poorly chosen.",5,3,5,31 May 2013
Gangs of New York," Trying too hard to top his other films, Scorsese was shunned by the Academy yet again
","Martin Scorsese is of course the greatest filmmaker of our time and he proved that the gangster film was not merely an excuse to portray guys in fancy suits and shootouts. All of his previous films, except The Age of Innocence and Kundun are set in modern times and while the setting of this film allowed Scorsese to give the film a more extravagant look, I thought it was an immense disappointment. The biggest problem is the rather muddled character development. I didn't really feel that the characters were believable which is strange because the film is supposedly based on reality. The Daniel Day-Lewis character was by far the most developed and he should have won an Oscar for it.The two other leads, Leonardo DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz are totally unbelievable, both as the characters they are playing and also that they should be attracted to each other. And in risking to get a thousand hate mails, I think that Diaz is way out of DiCaprio's league, not acting wise but in the maturity of their appearances. There has always been a childish demeanor about DiCaprio which is probably why he only portrayed Howard Hughes in the early part of his life in Scorsese's most recent epic The Aviator.I just wondered why it took me so long to comment on this film because I am usually prone to share my opinions on all of Scorsese's work (look at my other commentaries) and I think the reason is this: Though I think that this is the worst Scorsese film I have seen it is unlike anything else that has ever been filmed before. Filmmakers have usually been concentrating on the west when films are set before the 20th century and to see a New York setting before the Godfather trilogy took place is an innovative idea but the story lacks clarity and that is very risky in a 3 hour film. The best reason to see this is the performances and Liam Neeson gives the film a bravura opening and Jim Broadbent is also credible as an American gang lord. Other than that it is mostly a chance to see Scorsese make a visual spectacle that he would continue in The Aviator. To put this to rest; no, I didn't think Chicago was better deserving of the Best Picture Oscar but Scorsese wasn't snubbed by the Academy for no reason.",7,0,0,26 February 2006
The Breakfast Club," And you thought that your problems were extreme
","The very first Brat Pack flick (there had been others but not with the entire group). There are only a few missing like Rob Lowe and Demi Moore from St. Elmo's Fire. It is nothing like any of the undergraduate slob films like Porky's and the MeatBalls series. This flick tries to take teen angst seriously and it examines the various types you will find in high school, like the jock, the nerd, etc.Judd Nelson gives the performance he would be called upon to do again and again, the angry loner who has a terrible home life and who always seems to know everything much better than you. Not that his acting isn't good here but you get weary of seeing him shout and be provocative to everybody in the course of almost 2 hours. He would retread his character here in 'Blue City' and 'Fandango' and finally he couldn't get any choice films to his credit. The other Brat Packers do not have as flashy a presence as Nelson and you can see why they had trouble finding work after the craze was over.As for the film itself it is rather original. To set almost the entire movie in a class room was a bit of a gamble, especially since such high voltage action films like Beverly Hills Cop and Top Gun would dominate the box office for most of the middle to late 80's. There has to be some pretty impressive dialog to hold the audience's interest and nobody could write it like John Hughes. The fact that the F-word is spoken frequently was probably shocking to a lot of adults at the time and that is probably why it has an 'R' rating.Be warned, though, that this is not a comedy and anyone who is expecting it will be sorely disappointed. John Hughes has also written great comedies like 'Planes, Trains and Automobiles' but the mood of this picture can be interpreted as terribly depressing. There are some scattered laughs but it is only because the adult characters, especially the principal is such buffoons that you laugh derisively at them. All in all I will say that even though the pace is enormously slow the viewing of this film should not be missed because after all the Brat Pack was talented and they were fun to watch.",7,0,1,30 August 2005
The Social Network," Riveting Fincher/Sorkin collaboration
","I was a very reluctant user of the Facebook page and I also had doubts about seeing this movie which I thought could not possibly be interesting. Plus, when I heard that the writer was Aaron Sorkin and the director, David Fincher - that just seemed like an odd combination.Pleasantly surprised, I couldn't believe how good it was. The character of Mark Zuckerberg is unsympathetic to put it mildly. I was baffled by how petty, jealous and stone cold he was. Then, the revelation. This is a movie about a screwed up person who can't relate to anyone and he unites everybody else in creating the page. How ironic.There is no happy ending, no perfect resolution between the conflicts and no character you can absolutely root for here. That is quite an achievement. Not even the Andrew Garfield character who is supposed to be the sympathetic one. He may be the one who gets screwed over, but we realise as we learn more, that he is also misguided in thinking that his way is right. Don't we just all hate those ads that he wants on the site.All the performances are great, but I especially liked Armie Hammer's Vinklevoss twins. It was quite difficult as I heard it, but he really nailed the different nuances of two people who look exactly alike.Fincher has made some less than stellar movies like Alien3 and I was not a big fan of Se7ven either, but this is one to be noticed. One big minus, though is Justin Timberlake.",Null,0,0,29 August 2011
Goodfellas," Scorsese's definitive gangster epic, running rings around both Casino and Gangs of New York
","The themes of this extraordinary film are in fact quite ordinary when you think about it. The wish that Henry Hill has to be respected and to have all of his desires fulfilled are wishes that we all can relate to. The fact that he has to lie, cheat and steal and in some cases kill to get it, will probably not relate to many but in Henry's world it is just as ordinary as brushing your teeth. Martin Scorsese paints a portrait of a man who wants it all but is somehow unwilling to pay the price.The character Henry Hill, based on a real person, is weak in spirit. He doesn't seem to be ruthless enough to be a gangster and it will eventually spell his doom. Ray Liotta gives an excellent performance that really shows range. He has played bad guys before but also basically decent men like his role in 'Dominick and Eugene' and 'Corrina, Corrina'. Here he covers both sides. He is immensely nasty to everybody who tries to steal from him but is also quite sympathetic when it comes to looking out for his family. His wife, played by Lorraine Bracco, is not really a criminal but she is turned on by crime and the fact that Henry kills for a living is not something that bothers her in the beginning.There are several good supporting performances in this movie but to name just the really important: 1) Robert De Niro as Jimmy Conway (even though he has top billing). This is not one of his best roles but he is an important figure in the last part of the movie and the way he reacts to the death of somebody really close to him is quite frightening but then again that's no big surprise. 2) Joe Pesci as Tommy DeVito. What can you say except: Bravo! Nobody could have played this totally evil character better. And finally Paul Sorvino as Paul. His may not be the most flamboyant role but he does have some eccentricacies that are quite amusing and unlike Marlon Brando in The Godfather, he has a more relaxed performing style and he is therefore more credible as a real person.The superb editing of Thelma Schoonmaker must also be credited for making this film such an exhilarating experience. Three hours seem like a half in this film and it's nice that she just won her second Oscar for the Aviator.The truth is that even though Scorsese has made bad movies his track record is the absolute best for any filmmaker. So let's hope that he does something outstanding very soon as he has been in kind of a slump lately.",10,1,2,26 March 2005
Valkyrie," Tom Cruise in his absolute best performance
","Although, you can say a lot about Tom Cruise that doesn't always sound flattering, you can not deny that he is more than just a former teen idol who rested on his laurels.After going through the 80s and 90s seeing him in such dismal efforts as Cocktail and Days of Thunder, (Not Top Gun, since far from being the most brilliant film, it is pretty cool), where he pretty much played the same character, he actually keeps his character affectation-free.It was a wise choice not to attempt to give the characters German accents as well because that always lead to unintentional hilarity (think Peter Sellers in Dr. Strangelove). Apart from Cruise, Bill Nighy, Terence Stamp and Tom Wilkinson are also first rate. Eddie Izzard is especially good in a pivotal role and is almost unrecognizable.The director, Bryan Singer is a master at creating tension at the right moments, causing the mystery to be not that easy to figure out as might expected. The ending is a bit drawn out but overall you get kind of swept up in a story, you basically know how will end.",7,1,2,8 June 2009
The Simpsons Movie," Nowhere near worthy of the hype but you are not a sucker to have paid to see it
","18 years in the making. The phrase featured in the trailer loses a great deal of momentum when seeing the finished product, that being The Simpsons Movie. It's difficult to describe why you are let down but it happens all the same. Maybe, it is simply this: A TV show that has been on for more than half of my life and has brought gut wrenching hilarity in more than 90 % of the episodes, it is extremely difficult to top what has gone before, even in a big screen format.One thing you can improve upon is the visuals and here the SM does not disappoint. The backgrounds are spectacular and the character designs are as good as it gets. Some of the episodes of the TV-series featured freak character designs that gave you an unsettled stomach. Not so here. Also, the character traits are all carried over without many makeovers. Homer is as thickheaded as ever but you of course know that he is basically a decent Joe who will do right at the end. Marge has a scene that is a bit heartbreaking but is pretty much the same as well. The writing is top-notch as usual with as many puns, one liners and visual gags as a good, sillier Simpsons episode.One problem is cramming all the supporting characters in Springfield into the movie's brief running time which reduces most of them to mere walk-ons or left out all together (No Duffman or Sideshow Bob - barely any Apu or Chief Wiggum and only a 1 minute cameo by Mr Burns).And why do you ask. To make room for a super-villain in the form of what else? A government official voiced by A Brooks, who can be very annoying when given free range but even more sad, he is pretty much devoid of any humor here.Tom Hanks as himself? Why not? The celebrity roster has pretty much run out. The only top celebrities who haven't done the show yet are to my recollection, Jack Nicholson (strange because he has been in three of James L. Brooks' movies), Tom Cruise (a big kahuna the producers have never been able to land) and Robert De Niro who to my knowledge has never even been approached, not even for a gangster character.What it all adds up to is a satisfying extended version of an episode and a feast for the eyes but to add more kudos would be giving more credit than what is due.",8,2,7,4 August 2007
All the President's Men," We all know how it ends
","Journalism was still kind of a revered profession when this was made but I don't think that many movie directors had thought about making a movie about journalism and particularly a movie that weren't about showbiz journalist. I think the last movie that dealt with the subject was 'The Front Page', but it was more about the glamour of it all.There is nothing glamorous about the subject in this really good, but also flawed take. The flaws are minor but I wouldn't consider this to be the masterpiece that some will undoubtedly see it. First off, the movie is a bit sketchy about who Woodward and Bernstein were. At the time I saw this movie for the first time, I didn't think they were actual living persons.The movie goes to a great length to show almost all the key persons who were involved in the scandal of the century. The problem is that so many names are hurled at the viewer that it is hard to separate them. At one point I thought that two characters in this were the same person.Otherwise, it was just great to see a movie with a different subject than most films. There are no love scenes, no shootings and no violence and that is what makes it unique. Redford and Hoffman are good in it too and despite some comments, that declares Hoffman as the better actor, let's not forget that Bernstein is the more flashy character. Redford must be credited for his very contained performance that reveal almost nothing about the demeanor of his character until one pivotal moment involving a major break in the case.",8,1,1,28 May 2011
The Fighter," Exceptional teaming of Wahlberg and Bale
","It's hard to say which one of the two leads deserve the most praise and that's just one of the great things you can credit this magnificent film for.Mark Wahlberg has firmly left his Marky Mark days behind him and has been in some of the most praised American films of the 90s and 00s. and he is no dummy. He knows he will look good if he is surrounded by top- notch talent, even if it means being overshadowed by them.I can honestly say that I couldn't find one bad performance in The Fighter, even down to the smallest parts. The whole thing seemed totally authentic and credit therefore must go not only to Bale and Wahlberg but certainly in no small way to David O. Russell.But we must remember that this is especially Bale's show. His performance cannot be diminished. It is an extremely scary and sad character but we totally believe his transformation. It is also a little frightening to think that he actually looks not at all well through the entire thing. He must have starved himself to slim down to that stick figure.The one thing I couldn't really understand was the fight scenes. How come Wahlberg's fighter can take numerous extremely hard blows to the head without much damage? It hardly looks like he's been hit, except for the first fight. But I'll let that one slide.Otherwise, kudos all around. Extremely well crafted, superb underdog story and what about that Amy Adams. She will definitely bring in all the boys. She is not a bad actress either.",9,0,0,4 February 2013
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Not the best of an otherwise exceptional Coen resume
","The best Coen films are usually the ones that have extreme quirks like the one and only 'Barton Fink'. Here, however, the muddled storyline is too ordinary or to put it another way, the Coens seem to want some kind of mainstream acceptance that has otherwise not been their goal before. The cast does well in their respective roles but there is something too familiar about the whole set up. Yes, there were a lot of rural dramas in the 30's and 40's but the Coens seem too much in love with these movies to satirize them. That means that it is more of an homage than reinterpretation and that's a shame because they had so good luck with their ode to screwball comedy 'The Hudsucker Proxy.' All the Coens' favorites are here including John Goodman, John Turturro and Holly Hunter but most of the time is wasted on crass southern stereotypes and to make fun of them is acceptable but it's annoying to see it for the umpteenth time. The best thing about this is the tinted photography which gives the film a worn out look that goes great with the rural setting. Otherwise, this can only be described as a failed effort but even low-grade Coen is better than almost every other movie so I have continued to see their movies because which other director/writer/producer team do the U.S. have that are more than just providers of pop corn entertainment.",4,0,0,6 September 2005
