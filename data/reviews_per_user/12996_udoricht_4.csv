Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," What did you expect to see more?
","If you take this movie so serious you'll be disappointed 'cause it's not. But if you take it as fun movie, fulled of action/fantasy/horror scenes and as what it is then you can give it a chance. Maybe, the character of Abraham Lincoln defined as vampire slayer is naive and childish and is not what you expected to see for historical important figure. Maybe someone thinks that this is disgrace for the character. And finally maybe someone thinks there is a storyline abstraction 'cause the book is better and I don't doubt that even I haven't read it. All this defects are not so important if you like movies in this kind of genre like Underworld, Resident Evil etc. This was a movie that deserves attention and give it a try.",7,23,33,22 October 2012
Argo," Certainly, this movie deserves Oscar and it's gonna get it
","When Ben Affleck came up with the idea to direct this movie he thought this way: 'OK, I'll never gonna get my Oscar for best actor but if I direct movie that rises patriotism it's gonna happen for sure. American movie academy likes that. Remember Kathryn Bigelow and 'The Hurt Locker'. It doesn't really matter anything else.' And it is what is going to be. This movie has so many flaws that makes me think where to start. The storyline is one-sided. One side is a good one and wants to save fugitives from certain death and second side is a bad one and wants to kill them as being spies. Totally clich√©. The plot is shallow, barren, predictable and after while becomes boring. I don't think that the events described in the movie really happened this way and are authentic. Many countries protested about it (Iran, Great Britain, New Zeland and even Canada) so the storyline is very disputable. Acting was in the background cause the purpose of the movie was patriotic. Ben Affleck acting skills are weak as always. Alan Arkin and John Goodman are great actors as always but hadn't chance to show more themselves cause the script is barren. Directing is disputable and you may not like it. If you expected to see a good and realistic political drama watch 'Syriana'. This movie is not what you were expected to be. I never liked one-sided stories.",2,89,171,5 February 2013
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Stupidity on high level
","Someone recommended me this one cause it will make me laugh. On the contrary it made me puke.The whole movie is stupid video game without any sense that makes you watch it. The script and the acting were so bad like some kind of B-movie. Maybe some kids will like it but when they grow up, will understand this was totally rubbish.The only reason I rate it more than one are special effects which were I guess the corner stone of this movie 'cause the storyline is pointless.I can't believe that some critics liked it 'cause I don't see any amount.Just annoy it and watch something else.",2,8,14,6 May 2012
The Woman in Black," Good spooky movie
","For all mystery/horror/suspense fans this would be very good flick. It has a lots of scary moments and was acted and directed well. The only think I may complain is a script. It could've been I guess a little bit better. Somehow a basic topic about ghost vengeance is too many times used in this kind of genre and recycling over and over again. Someone may think it was the point of this movie but where is originality? There are about 10-15 minutes in continuity without any spoken word as well but filled with spooky thrills. The end was maybe a little unexpected but I think it came too early. Whatever, give a chance to this movie and watch it and you may like it.",7,0,1,6 May 2012
