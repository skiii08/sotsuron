The Blair Witch Project," Scariest Movie I have ever seen
","I recently was chosen to see The Blair Witch Project in my local theater as the first audience outside of The Sundance Film festival.  This is one of the most innovative and creative movies I have ever seen.  Every time the movie was at nightfall, my heart was actually racing.  This movie did not base itself on physical horror it was 99% psychological, which made it all the more suspenseful.  I have never seen a movie like it with as much realism as this movie conveyed.  I give it 2 thumbs up.  You have to see this movie.  When it is over, you will see that it is all you can talk about.",10,1,4,19 February 1999
