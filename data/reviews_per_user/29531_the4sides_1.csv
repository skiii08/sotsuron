Minority Report," One of Spielberg's Best
","Minority Report is one of Steven Spielberg's best films of all time. Tom Cruise gives an amazing performance as Det. John Anderton. Believeable, intriguing, and suspenseful. Colin Farrell provides adequate support. Accompanied by many wonderful one-liners, Minority Report keeps you guessing until the very last frame. You definately need to add this one to the 'Go and Rent' list, if you haven't seen it yet.",Null,0,0,24 April 2003
