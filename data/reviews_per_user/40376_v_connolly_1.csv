Walk the Line," For Dad
","Right where do I start. The film was completely awesome and it captured the desire of Cash to perform and prove an inspiration for a generation. The music was brilliant and the acting was complete beauty! I remember my Dad playing Cash when I was young and me giggling at the swearing and not really understanding the power. I'm older now and understand the passion. I wish that my Dad was still here to enjoy this film. I remember my Dad playing the Folsam Prison blues and I was completely overwhelmed by the power that I heard and when the film began I heard it again, older and wiser. Here was man with a message for the common man that empowered the struggle but also showed us salvation. The film captured the desire and the Love of 2 people drawn to each other and never parting until death, but even that was a vacation. Johnny and June you are in are hearts always.
