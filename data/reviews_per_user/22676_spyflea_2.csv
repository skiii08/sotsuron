The Sound of Music," Great Movie
","I though this movie was excellent for the time that it was made.  As a 20 year old male i doubt you will every hear it from another one.  The way that pure love, not only between a husband and wife but father and children and mother and children as well, was portrayed made this one of the most romantic films of all time. Definately one of my favourite films.",9,1,8,3 January 2004
American Beauty," Perfect Film
","Watching this movie really moves me.  I think this is the best film of my time as a film goer, is that a word?  Anyways, this is very well written, the characters are extremely colourful and well portrayed, the sets are again colourful and bright, and its depiction of life, I think, is perfect. I love this movie and I like it more every time that I see it.  It really straightens the lines of life that are usually very winding.",10,0,1,3 January 2004
