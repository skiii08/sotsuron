Catch Me If You Can," Great Story, but....
",Excellent storytelling. But what is with all the young ladies in this film?? Every single one of them acts like a beauty queen contestant finalist from the 1970s - 80s. They are so fake. Same goes for the anyone who sees Abagnale as a pilot - who ever behaved (or does behave) that way when they saw an airline pilot in uniform? Was this added to keep the film lighthearted or something? It took away from the film as far as I'm concerned and made it feel like a average production.,5,0,0,6 May 2020
