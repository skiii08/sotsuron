Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Pretty good!
","OK, I know that this movie has been said by some people to have no plot or character development. But this is not something that is a letdown! Most of the development will probably come in the other 2 movies. Also, compared to the old ones the visual effects in TPM were stunning! Especially the pod race. You could decide to skip this movie and go straight to the other ones in three years. But go see this one, if only for the sake of the effects.",9,0,0,23 May 1999
