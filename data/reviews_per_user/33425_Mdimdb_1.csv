The Incredible Hulk," in a word 'amazing'
","not only was this film great but it is one of the best marvel films ever made. This film was one of the best superhero films i have ever seen as well as Ironman. What a twist at the end of this film where we see TONY STARK aka IRONMAN. Will we see HULK and IRONMAN battle in a sequel? i hope so. I completely recommend this film to anyone who loves marvel or superhero films. WATCH IRONMAN BEFORE YOU SEE THIS FILM...it plus it is a lot quicker to get in to unlike the old HULK film in 2003 which i still enjoyed and the special effects in this are fantastic especially Hulk and abombination, i thought that the hulk in 2003 looked great but this is so much better.",7,3,5,6 July 2008
