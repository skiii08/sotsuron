Requiem for a Dream," Bravo! A Modern Day Masterpiece!
",This is an ubelievable film which is the best movie at describing drugs and the highest and lowest points of a user.  I was stunned to see the reality that made me feel as if I had taken those drugs as well although I never have.  You almost start to lose your own insanity towards the end of the movie along with the characters due to an overflow of clarity and realism by Aronofsky and Selby in this unbelievable film.,10,0,1,20 September 2003
