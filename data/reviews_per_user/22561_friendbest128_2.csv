Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Hate
","While I necessarily don't agree with all the hate that Episode 1 is getting, I can see why fans are mad. George Lucas took CGI by the horns and tried to 'carry' his production with it. However, I did enjoy this movie, although a rehashing gone wrong there are still some great aspects. The new series allowed newer generations to experience the force that was 'Star Wars' in a different way, not necessarily bad, just different. The character development and immersion was definitively weaker than it was in the original series. The original series allowed the viewer to relate to the characters and join the journey with them. Thew new star wars makes characters look more like actors than actual characters.",Null,0,3,20 September 2012
The Lion King," A Timeless Classic
","The Lion King; another timeless classic by Disney. The heartwarming story of Simba will never escape our hearts. The Lion King is the story of Simba, a young cub whose trying to find his place in the world after the death of his father, Mustafa. This story is full of hidden meanings, emotions, metaphors and analogies that each person could take away something different from each viewing. It's hard to find flaws in such a work of art but the way that Disney rehashes scenes from other Disney movies is definitely one of them. They don't take away from the experience of the movie but it's something that a movie veteran could definitely notice.",10,0,0,20 September 2012
