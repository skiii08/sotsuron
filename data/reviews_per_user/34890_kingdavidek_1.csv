The Avengers," Cheesy, nothing new, disappointing.
","I went into this movie with some very high expectations (I don't feel this was unjustified) and I came out pretty disappointed. The special effects were not enough to justify some screaming plot holes that I was inches away from screaming out in the middle of the movie theatre, not to mention the at times stolid performances from some of the cast. Lets get something clear, just because two characters argue, does not mean an 'extra dimension' was added to them. Robert Downey Junior does a good job but there is little else here in terms of acting. Apart from this, the movie just follows a PAINFULLY formulaic story line. Team of superheroes get together to fight a grand evil and must put their differences aside for the greater good, which they eventually do. And of course, Captain America struts onto the scene and begins shouting orders, somehow he rips this authority from thin air amongst a God, an egotistic super genius millionaire and the bloody Hulk! Overall cheesy, completely devoid of any novelties and shamelessly formulaic. the 3 stars are for the slight entertainment I got from the film at times.",3,3,11,2 September 2012
