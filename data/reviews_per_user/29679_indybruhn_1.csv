Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Nothing against the original Star Wars
","Well,I travelled to New York to see this movie.New York was great but the movie was only good! Episode1 is nothing against the original Star Wars from 1977. A Star Wars movie without Harrison Ford is like Germany without beer!!! I hope episode 2 will be better!",4,0,1,29 February 2000
