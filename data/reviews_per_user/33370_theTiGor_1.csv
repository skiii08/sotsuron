The Incredible Hulk," Entertaining if you let it be...
","This is typical 'brain candy' fare. It can be a fun movie to watch if only you don't take it too seriously or try to read much into it. It is perhaps best to watch it presuming that *everything* you are seeing is set in a fictitious universe that only shares a certain number of things in common with the one we live in and know well. Current and former military personnel will have to find a way to ignore a number of things that are obviously not right, such as exclusive use of uniforms (woodland BDU's) that were phased out of use by the time the movie was released (2008), and curious wear of those, such as only having name tapes but no service tapes ('U.S. ARMY') sewn on and flagrant violations of the grooming standards we're used to. Helicopters marked 'USAF' rather than 'United States Air Force' would be another oddity many will notice. Again, it's an action film about something that is highly unlikely to even be possible in the first place, not a documentary! Overlook the things that 'aren't right', go with the flow, and have fun with it.",5,0,0,28 January 2018
