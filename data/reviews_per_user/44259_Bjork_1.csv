The Blair Witch Project," don't believe the hype
","So, ok, I went to see this movie and when it was over, my reaction was one of complete disinterest.   Maybe more backstory would have helped.  Maybe some character development.  I don't know - it just wasn't scary.  An eerie, tense mood was definitely created, but there was no payoff.  Utterly forgettable.",4,0,1,9 August 1999
