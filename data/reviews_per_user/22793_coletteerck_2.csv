War Dogs," A Good Movie that made me think!
",This was a great movie I saw in the theater last night. Jonah Hill gives a manic and amazing performance and the woman who plays Isa is really good too. There movie I think centers on money and friendship and war and really makes you think about how personal values shape your loves and losses in life. The tension is thick and that makes it a good film. Some characters are flat and I think Bradley Cooper could have had much more screen time. If you like crime thriller type stories this is your movie. It was boring at the end but parts of it really gripping and lots of humor as well. I think the film took on too much narrative type story listing events and could have just let go more and let art speak for the details or look them up later online. I think the facts were to heavy handed presented and that bogged it down. The foreign minor characters were brilliantly played. Definitely a film about the Ugly American. Well played.,8,0,0,27 August 2016
X-Men: Apocalypse," Great Summer Movie
",I think this is an enjoyable cinematic film and as with other X Men movies the special effects are so well done. The actors save this film from being a flop because the story line is not that great. It kind of plods along there are one or two great surprising moments but it just never really goes that deep but the acting and special effects and if you love the X Men story like I do make this fun summer movie fare. I grade it enjoyable but needs some plot reworking to be great. I love Jennifer Lawrence in this movie wow is she great. I see a lot of potential with the younger actors and their story lines as well and I can't wait until the next X Men comes out.,8,5,8,11 August 2016
