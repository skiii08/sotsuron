Hereditary," Fell short
","This film is so disturbing but man it could've been great if these characters just had normal and relatable reactions to trauma. That alone ruined it for me and I'm a big Toni Collette fan. Even her brilliance couldn't save it. However, even with that distraction, this film left me feeling creeped out which is what scary movies should do. I appreciate how it all came together but I just wish it was just a little more relatable. I would've felt very traumatized if I was able to sympathize more with these characters.",6,0,2,25 November 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Missed the mark for me
","I love QT. Love the Kill Bills, Pulp, Inglorious Basterds, Reservoir Dogs, Death Proof...but this one missed the mark for me. I didn't find the dialogue witty or clever as it usually is. I didn't find it very funny except once with Leo lamenting on being a has been and the Bruce Lee scene. To me the Bruce Lee scene was the best part of the movie. That scene had the witty clever feel to it and the fight was both funny and realistic. I also appreciated all the QT favorites showing up like Zoe Bell, Kurt Russell, Michael Madsen, and Red Apple cigs to name a few.Like the fictional fantastic ending of Inglorious Basterds, I was happier with this ending but without the real deal what was the point of developing the Sharon Tate character? I do think the acting was absolute topnotch especially from Leo, Brad, Brad's dog, and the little girl, Julia Butters, who stole thunder from the big guns. However I was often bored throughout the movie. There was too much down time with zero dialogue. Lots of driving and walking.I was just overall disappointed but I still love QT and always will.",5,14,22,2 August 2019
