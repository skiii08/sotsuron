First Man," It all comes Down to Bad Direction
","I realize they wanted to make it dramatic and try to cover stuff that other movies covering this topic have yet to do. That being said they focused minutes on scenes that could have taken seconds and thinks that could have shown the real drama of the moment have been compressed into mere seconds.This director really shows that he has littler to no interest in the history of space and almost all interest in trying to impress the critics. Sadly the critics and the masses rarely agree. Now I am not going to lampoon the direction. It is a decent and emotional movie. The problem is there are two stories going on here. The personal life of Neil Armstrong and The Moon Landing. The Moon Landing scene was good the build up action scenes were not save a couple. Many scenes felt rushed or even sped up at times. That bugged me. There is little to no time to build anticipation. It falls flat.The Dramatic scenes fall short as well. I understand that Neil was described as a recluse at times and not an outgoing person but wow. They have taken it to the next level here. Most of the movies he shows little to no depth. He could literally be replaced by a mannequin in some scenes because the director relies on emotional music and light blooms to show the emotion. For a man who has so much written about him and justifies a whole movie made of him, it is hard to believe by the way he is portrayed in the movie that anyone got enough out of him to write anything useful.I could care less about the controversy. This is the result of a director coming off success that thought he had another award in the bag with this. Sadly he does not. That has been proven. This is a confused movie at best. Do they want to portray the climate of the 1960's racial tensions... Sure put it in the movie but how does it move the plot. It doesn't. It affects the story not one but. I get it, I'm a history buff but you dont have to throw this stuff in to appease people.Make something exciting and watchable and inspire a generation of people who are excited and interested to go out and read books on everything having to do with the topic and era. For me that was Apollo 13, The generation before me had the right stuff. This generation has this confused mess.",6,1,2,13 January 2019
