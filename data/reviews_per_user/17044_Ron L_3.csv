The Blair Witch Project," extremely boring, 100% hype
","The only possible way this 'film' could be bearable to audiences would be to lie to them and tell them it really happened, and this was the actual footage - which is exactly what the film makers did.I saw the film after I knew it wasn't real.  I alternated between being bored and annoyed for the entire 45 minutes I watched it.  After 45 minutes of suffering, I just had to stop watching (it was either that or put a bullet in my head).  If you are going to make a film without a script, you damn well better have actors who can improvise - unfortunately, the 'actors' in Blair Witch do not have that ability.Wouldn't it be funny if a poorly written movie with no plot, no script, bad acting, and bad filming could be hyped enough to make millions of dollars? The joke is on us, the paying public, and I'm not laughing.0 out of 10 - totally without merit.",1,8,14,17 July 2000
The Matrix," Over-hyped, Style over Substance
","I had high hopes for this movie, being a huge fan of the 'what if none of this is real?' genre, but I was disappointed.  The film does have a few things going for it - let me cover those first, since that won't take long. The visuals are beautiful and stunning - whoever shot this movie is indeed an artist.  I can't remember a film that was this fascinating just to look at.  The film also has a creative and intriguing premise (which I can't mention, or it would spoil it).  Keanu Reeves, who is a horrible actor, is actually more tolerable in this flick than he has been in most of his others - mostly due to the fact that the role requires almost no acting.  Keanu does look good in the film, and Carrie-Ann Moss looks fantastic in tight PVC pants!  That's it for the good, now for the bad: the story has holes in it the size of Texas.  Is it really so hard to write a story that makes sense, that is tightly crafted?  Total Recall and The Terminator come to mind as examples of tightly written sci-fi films.  I can't go into the details of the many, many things that just don't make sense since it would spoil it for those who haven't seen it.  Did the writers not understand virtual reality at all, or did they just assume the audience was too ignorant to notice the absurdities and non-sensical aspects of their virtual world?  Seems like the makers of The Matrix just got lazy.  They had a great premise and Keanu Reeves, so they just threw in some extended slo-mo gunfights, kung-fu battles, lots of big explosions, a pounding soundtrack, and called it a day - very crass.  About those slo-mo gunfights, kung-fu battles, big explosions, and pounding soundtrack - they came across as very contrived - obviously hacked onto the story to make it an 'action' movie.  How obviously formulaic!  I can just hear the producer saying 'We have a pretty good story here, but we want to make it an 'action' movie, so stick in these elements...'.  This film had serious potential, but ended up as merely mediocre - what a shame.  5 out of 10.",5,0,1,27 September 1999
Jackie Brown," build, build, build, fizzle
","I was not very impressed with this film.  It was definitely too long.  It was definitely sluggish.  Pam Grier is an adequate actress, but I didn't think she was as hot looking as the camera seemed to think she was.  I'm not sure why people call this a 'character study', but I think it means that since the plot is so boring, the only thing the film has to offer is interesting characters.  The big pay-off I was expecting after two hours of development was a complete disappointment.  I'm also tired of Quentin's technique of writing 'hip, street-wise' dialogue, which consists of using the word 'nigger' liberally.  On the plus side, Samual Jackson was fantastic.  His performance alone is probably the only reason I would recommend this film to anyone.  Five out of ten.",5,2,6,25 November 1998
