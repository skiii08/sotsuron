The Hangover," Brilliant!
","Oh my god! Just saw this tonight and it was true comedy genius.One of the funniest films I have ever seen and definitely the funniest of the year.The cast are all fantastic in their roles, some of the cameos are brilliant.Some of the stuff that happens in the film is just crazy and random but it just makes it even funnier!If you see one comedy this year make it this one, you won't regret going to see it.Oh and make sure you watch the beginning of the credits and don't walk straight out, it's really funny!",9,3,7,24 June 2009
Kick-Ass," Greatest ever 'Super-hero' movie??
","Went to see this the other day after months and months of waiting...I had wanted to see this since the first time I read anything about it. I had it hyped up big time in my own mind, especially after seeing the amazing reviews that it had already got on IMDb.I think it's pretty safe to say that I was not disappointed by this film. I loved it. Kick-ass is a great character and is played well by Aaron Johnson. Christopher Mintze=Plasse was great as Red Mist and I didn't think about 'McLovin' at all when watching him. Chloe Moretz is a great young actress and her portrayal of Hit Girl was just amazing! But my personal favourite character was Big Daddy...Nic Cage was wonderful in this film...right down to the way he spoke like Adam West's Batman when he was dressed as Big Daddy. Brilliant.The film plot was great too, we all want to be a super-hero right?? I know I have thought it at some point! This film takes that and puts it into a reality...well, in a movie, but you know what I mean. The actors played their roles really well, the young ones still acted like they were young even when they were trying to kill bad guys...showing fear at times and being strong when they needed to be.The only problems I had with this film...I had hyped it too much in my mind, sometimes the soundtrack didn't work with certain scenes of the movie and at times it was a little slow paced for my liking...but that didn't take away from how great this was.All in all this is the best film of the year so far. And in reply to my original title...is the the greatest super-hero movie ever?? I would have to say...yes, it probably is!",9,3,13,2 April 2010
300," Why did I wait so long??
","This film came out 5 years ago now and somehow I have only just watched it...I wish I had went to see it in the cinema, because it's immense. The most recent addition to my favourite movies of all time.I originally had this on Blu-ray a couple of years back, I got it free with my first PS3...I never did watch it. When I sold that PS3 to get a new slim version, I gave the film with it. Now, a year on, I have finally watched it in lower quality...I wish I had kept that Blu-ray! Silly me!The way this film is shot is fantastic, the story (based on truth) is fantastic, very entertaining. Plenty of action, blood and fighting. Gerard Butler is amazing in this film too, I know many people don't rate him highly as an actor, but after seeing this film I certainly do!If you still haven't seen this, do so, you won't regret it.",Null,0,3,9 September 2011
Sin City," Good but over-rated
","Just a quick one here.I'll start by saying that this was a good film. I liked the way it was shot, the film noir style, the direction was good. I just thought that the stories themselves were nothing special. I liked the parts with Bruce Willis, they were the most entertaining. The parts with Josh Hartnett were just pointless. The story following Micky Rourke was half decent. The one that ruined it for me was the Clive Owen one, mainly because of his terrible American accent, but also I lost interest half way through.I bought this on Blu-ray for Â£10 and to be honest I should have just bought it on DVD for cheaper, because I'm now left disappointed.",Null,1,2,9 September 2011
