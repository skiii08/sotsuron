The Blair Witch Project," $30, 000??? For this peice of crap.
","I was reading a review in the review archive for this film and I found a review that mirrored my thoughts exactly.  People make such a big deal about how low budget this film was because it was only $30, 000 compared to Star Wars or something.  Because people usually hear such big amounts of dollars when a big film is released they instantly think $30, 000 is nothing. Thirty grand is alot of money when you have nothing to show for it.  What the hell did they spend $30, 000 on.  Were all the trees marijuana?  Were they staying in a luxury hotel?  Did they go and buy a used car each? Were the scripts printed on gold?  There is absolutley nothing to show for the $30,000 they spent on this film.  Just some jerky camera work, alot of f words, the most boring 1 hour and 20 minutes of the viewers life and the biggest scam in hollywood history.  Seriously think about what thirty grand would have been spent on.  They were camping in the bush for 8 days for christs sake.  This film has its good moments but is so startlingly unreal and fake it spoils it.  If you were being chased by a force you could not see that was trying to kill you would you film it?  I don't think so. Most normal people would be worrying about surviving.  Thank you Blair Witch Project for finally convincing me that with alot of advertising you can turn a piece of crap into a phenomenom.  Hell i might just go film the sequel right now.  And i'm sure it wouldn't cost me thirty thousand.",Null,0,1,26 February 2000
The Mummy," Just so cool.
","This film is not going to change your outlook on life.  It is not going to make you cry and think of those long departed.  This film is just going to give you pure fun.  Brendan Fraser shines as he is perfect for his role.  A smart mouthed, comedic, cocky, s.o.b who of course needs to save the world with the aid of a useless sweed and a good looking girl.  I was told this film was boring and had no scientific basis and is too unrealistic.  So what if some science geek has proven the whole story wrong, it is just a film. This film works.  Go see it.  Turn your brain off, have a laugh, and just enjoy yourself. 9/10",Null,0,0,27 December 1999
American Pie," The single greatest film ever created!!!
","I cannot praise this film enough.  I hadn't even really heard about it but when I saw it I could not stop laughing.  It has a superb storyline, something every boy (and some girls) can relate to.  It has a sensational cast, most are very little known, and a pumpin' soundtrack.  In particular Bic Runga 'Sway'.  (hey shes a new zealander what do you expect me to say???).  I give this film a big 12 out of 10 and I cannot wait to see this one again.  Warning to guys.  Don't take your girlfriend to this one.  Go with the boys.",Null,0,0,4 November 1999
Toy Story 2," Hamm, you are a legend
",You talk about great films and it doesn't get much greater than this. Superb graphics and silky smooth animation make this film leave toy story 1 in the dust.  Hamm is the highlight with some clever phrases.  Of course Buzz is in fine form and old spud head is a damn fine peice of potato.9/10,Null,0,0,19 December 1999
The Sixth Sense," How can you describe this.
",I saw this film in the USA.  My friend and I had no idea what this film was about because there had been no previews in New Zealand at that point.  We thought this was possibly the sequel to the 5th element which rocked so we decided to see this.  I've never made a wiser decision.  I couldn't beleive this film.  We had no idea that the kid could see dead people so that came as much of a shock as the 'gotcha and gotcha again' ending.  If you have not seen this film you have no idea what you are missing.  Get it out.,Null,0,0,30 May 2000
The Matrix," Superb. Doesn't get much better.
","Well this was one of the big surprises of the year for me.  I thought with all the hype this would just be a bunch of Special Effects with cheesy acting and a happy ending.  I found I was wrong though.  The story is unbelievable.  I was stunned as the film progressed.  It has some amazing twists.  Unfortunately I thought it's downfall was the first half, which got quite boring after a while. Still I must say this is a superb peice of filmwork. 9/10",Null,0,0,17 December 1999
Cube," Unbelievable.
","We only got this film about 5 months ago in New Zealand at selected cinemas so I didn't get to see it until it came to video a few weeks ago.  This is one of those films that plays with your mind.  It plays with your heart strings and shows the destruction that is mankind.  I sat after the credits for about ten minutes unable to believe what I had just seen.  It rocked!! And like 'Braindead'('Dead Alive' in the USA), 'Heavenly Creatures', and The Full Monty it proves brilliant films do not need hollywood money or hype. Get this one out but be warned because this is one hell of a head f@#k.",Null,0,1,31 May 2000
