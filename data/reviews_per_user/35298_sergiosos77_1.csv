The Equalizer," My daddy paid so I can write/direct a Hollywood film :)
","This movie is so bad that really made me and my gf laugh at many scenes. It seems like a 10 years old wrote this, it only has clichés all over the film. There is no real action, and of course the bad guys always miss their shots. A vigilante for the dumbass that only wants to see a big explosion and some gunshots. You can really know what's coming next, and in this case it was all lame clichés about other action movies (someone compared this film with Die Hard, yes they even named the good guy with an Irish surname). There's nothing good in this movie, I cannot understand how people give it up to 9-10 stars. I've seen many bad action movies, but this is the worst.",1,19,38,20 December 2014
