Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Too many sore losers!
","Well ladies and gentlemen, the vote is in.Most of the so-called STAR WARS fans are losers.E.P. 1 is a great movie, hear me out.If you were say 13 again, it would have been a wonderful fantasy adventure, but now I'm 30-40 something and it sucked, LOSER.  Maybe I still know the kid inside me, and he loved it.  People are to hung-up on semantics. I know that as we get older, we get more rigid.  BUT LIGHTEN UP!!!I personally would like to Thank George for giving me one of the best gifts ever, The Star Wars Universe. All of it, including E.P. 1Thanks George.",9,1,2,3 September 2001
