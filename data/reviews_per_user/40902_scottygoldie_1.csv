Captain Phillips," Worth watching .... once
","I am ITCHING to write about how good the acting is in Captain Phillips(particularly tom hanks) . But most of the reviews here have already mentioned about this. In this review, i will take a look at areas where it COULD HAVE been better.The movie was very thrilling up to the part where they entered the safe boat. After that, it became a little less absorbing and quite predictable. OK, so there isn't very much they can do to improve the story. But here is my problem. I never really felt threatened by the pirates. Their acting was great but for me they didn't do enough to make me fear for the lives of the crew members. My instincts were right as none of the crew members got injured which was a bit disappointing. Personally, it would've been a good idea to make the pirates a bit more fearsome by hurting some of the crew members. Overall, this is a good movie, a 7.5/10 in my opinion. Is it a movie worth watching again? Perhaps not. Will i recommend watching the movie for the first time? Absolutely!",7,1,2,26 December 2013
