Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Disapointed
","This is not the beginning of the star-wars saga, this is the end! Its a total sell-out. A legend has passed away. Its time to bury it.",6,0,1,2 January 2002
Mamma Mia!," Rather disappointed, but not a total disaster
","Meryl Streep is overacting like shes on a theaterstage, not the silverscreen, there's a lot of forced joyfulness from most of the cast, its just not believable or immersive.But Seyfried is totally beautiful and sings as well as she looks (even though you can hear it is syntethized at times). She, and the music itself, and Stellan Skarsgard as the adventoures guy lifts this movie. Colin Firth is charming as always, but unfortunately hidden away most of the movie, and Brosnan does a decent job but not better than that.This all gives me a very uneven experience, sometimes i have this strong positive energy like from 'across the universe' sometimes i cringe as when i go to my local theater. (and believe me, its crap). I mostly cringe whem Meryl Streep is on the screen. I don't care that she is maybe the most gifted female actress still active today, she does NOT do a good job in this movie, and if she hadnt been famous already, most of you would agree with me.There is no chemistry between her and her friends, and her friends steal the show every time they are on screen all three of them. They are hilarious and I really enjoy their contributions. Even though I must say I didn't like the suspiciously sexist toy-boy song on the beach. Reminded me to much of the phenomenon western women who go to Africa for some 'black ivory'.All in all, a 'meh' experience.",5,1,2,12 November 2008
