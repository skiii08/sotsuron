Raiders of the Lost Ark," The only good thing about this is its theme
","After hearing so much about this and seeing a high imdb rating and directed by Steven, I had huge hopes. But alas!!!The movie has a very dull plot and little unlikeable character, but credit where its due, Harrison Ford plays it really well, it's the writing which makes Jones unlikable.And the way movie ends is so disappointing. I was like that's it, will that's a dudMy favourite part was the opening scene where Jones solves the hidden challenges (I wish the movie had more of those) and its awesome theme music.Overall, watch James Bond or Bourne Series, instead of wasting time on this overrated movie, which people are supposed to like because it had big names bind it like Lucas, Spielberg, Ford",Null,2,10,31 August 2018
Rocketman," One of the better musical biopics out there
","Before saying anything, here are few things
<ul><li>I don't like musicals</li><li>I never heard any song of Elton John</li><li>and I loved this movie</li></ul>I don't like musicals because they follow the same beat by beat story, which the one also did, but thanks to the amazing performances from everyone, really good vocal performance from Taron Egerton and a very well-paced movie, it was very watchable. My favorite was part was the first act where Elton John walks into the group-therapy meeting, in that phoenix-with-horns costume and talks about his childhood. His mon, nan, and father, all come across as real characters, and when they all start to sing, that was peak moment for me.As I never heard any songs of Elton, and know him because of his Grammy collaboration with Eminem on Stan, I am sure I would've missed on a lot as compared to Elton john-fanatics. But it's okay because I still enjoyed the movie.Unfortunately, like few other musician biopics like 8 mile, Straight outta Compton, this one doesn't have re-watchabilty for me. Yes, as you can guess, I'm a hip-hop fan. But those who like this musical genre and are fan of Elton, they will surely watch this movie again and again.",7,2,3,24 August 2019
Memento," This will keep you guessing!!!
","This movie grows over you with time.
That's the thing about cult movies, they get better as you're watching them. A very good movie can't do that sometime, they start of well and then just end with a flat note.Not with, this one.Honestly, I was little annoyed in first 15-20 mins, like ok I got it he killed him now showing how he got there not going the that fun, but each twist just got better and better. And THE ENDING...was heartbreaking and shocking at the same time.",Null,1,2,30 September 2018
Passengers," Good looking movie with awesome leads and bland stereo-typical plot
","Now this is a tough movie for me to judge, because I love the 2 leads. Both have so good screen presence that they almost made this movie look good.
And like mentioned in title, movie looks good.But as my rating would suggest I obviously had some issues with movie:1. Why wouldn't they wake someone else, because they obviously can. Why not wake pilot of ship?
2. How they can handle themselves in space, they're not astronauts.",Null,0,0,28 July 2018
Aquaman," Light and easy going
","This movie was trying hard to be Thor Ragnorak type, and it's not a bad thing. Fans haven't liked Dark and different tone of DCEU before, so a course correction is fine. This movie works because of the slick direction of James Wan and charming performance of Jason Momoa.I was so hesitant before Justice League after hearing the new news of the casting of Aquaman, and I didn't like persona, DC tried to show in JL trailers. But he was amazing in the movie. One of the saving grace in the 3rd act.Even then I wasn't much excited for this movie, but it turned out to be way better than my expectations. This movie is fast-paced, light-hearted and colorful, everything DCEU needs.Yes, people can say this movie is silly but if this movie would have taken Aquaman of all characters too seriously, it could have been Man of Steel 2.It was an entertaining movie, which I can see again once blue-ray comes up.Rating: 6
Meaning: Good, but might not watch it again.",6,1,1,10 August 2019
The Prestige," This movie is crimanaly underrated
","Just because Nolan made 
1. Interstellar (an epic space movie)
2. Dark night (First of it kind comic movie)
3. Inception (Truely masterpiece)This movie will always be counted after many of his title, when people will remembering his best workThis movie is masterpiece at every front:1. Character motivations
2. Rivalry (can't be this realistic)
3. Performances for actors, everyone was terrific
4. Cinematography, this movie is so easy on eyes
5. Editing, the less I say the best, masterfully doneAnd ofcourse, screenplay
I have seen it many times, and everytime the revelations from/via diary and magic acts amazes me",Null,1,2,28 July 2018
Bird Box," Great movie, with well-told story
","I can't believe people are calling it ripoff or pissing off on not getting answers. This movie had some great performances and amazing direction. I loved the flashback scenes and how group of different people tried to stay together to survive.
Also, that river scene gave me chills, amazingly filmed.Now, like some review mentioned, I didn't bought the fact that people can do some things shown in movie blindfolded.Also, I didn't liked the pacing, the movies could have 10-15 minutes short.Other than that movie was worth watching.Now, those who are saying, it's The Quite Place ripoff, I cam say The Quite place was ripoff of its source material. Yes, movie took inspiration from past movies/shows (Lost) but every movies does it. How many movies have taken inspirations from classics like Godfather, Psycho etc, are those ripoffs too?Also, the movie was not about getting answers of questions like why this phenomenon happened or what's with birds or those drawing but the survival of its characters.",6,1,5,1 January 2019

Dunkirk," Film's rating is such a crime, should be 8.5+
","The film is simply a masterpiece. Nolan does what very few can do, mixing a non-linear storytelling with humongous cast and fast paced editing to keep you glued. The fact that almost every veteran or war expert said this movie is realistic, shows how much research happened during pre-production.Thia movie captured the real emotions of soldiers on battlefield, everyone was afraid and wanted to go home. Isn't that what any of us would have wanted?Let me couner some stupid criticism I saw here in reviews,1. Characters don't have enough depthLet me tell you the movie is not about any character but about an world war 2 incident. About Dunkirk. This should be enough.2. Non-linear storytellingThis is what made movie more excited. Some people said that people in the different settings don't meet at all, that's just dumb. Have you seen Game of Thrones. Did any of the main characters meet, at least not before 6th season.3. Any other reasonNot sure what movie you were watching.
I think this movie became victim of hype. This movie is to underrate as it's by Nolan who is at his peak of direction, movie is pretty realistic based on Hollywood standards, no setting simply pulls audience into war field from the first scene.But the major one, it requires audience tonpay attention. Well, which not a lot of people love.",8,2,7,14 March 2019
Dunkirk," A very hard movie not to like!
","A very hard movie not to like!A movie directed by Christopher Nolan, based on world war and has Tom Hardy behind a mask. What else do you want? No, seriously, what else?This movie is very polarizing, it is unlike more traditional movies. It doesn't have a villain, well not the one which usually is obvious. It has a weird timeline, which Nolan might want to explain by chalk and board (get it?).What works for this movie is, how within minutes you're connected with characters. And when the characters go with tense situations, you feel it. All actors give a very well-strict performance, which you would expect from war. Also, like his every other movie, this movie requires multiple watches. And any movie which forces you to watch it again gets cult status.War, is clearly the villain of this movie, and he has already done damage to our 'heroes' before the movie even starts. And now, they''re just dealing with it.Rating: 9
Meaning: Can watch multiple time",8,1,3,10 August 2019
The Lion King," Decent, but could have missed
","Even someone like who have not watched the original 90s 'animated' Lion king, this was disappointing movie. No, not bad but just dull. I took couple of small naps during the movie.Maybe because we've already seen Mowgli and Jungle book, and this one is pretty similar to those. Or it was a predictable storline with nothing exciting.I'll say, I loved the last few minutes of movie and fight between lion and hyena and lion and lion was awesome. But it is not enough for re-watchability.But gives credit where are dues, amazing work from technical team who did state-of-art work. They looked like something you would expect from Discovery or NG show. Awesome work and I hope there's an Oscar to give for Visual effect because they deserve it.",6,1,2,10 August 2019
Mulholland Drive," Not my cup of tea
","I knew that this movie is a classic and touted as one of the best movie ever made. But it just never connected with me. Even though movie was gorgeously shot, but connection was just never there. I get that the movie is open to interpretations and last 10 minutes reveals a lot about the plot, even movies with twists keeps you interested till the end.I would have never sit through 150 minutes, if I won't have known that this movie is a must watch. But maybe movie is just not my type.",Null,0,2,17 October 2018
The Happening," Seriously! What M.Night was thinking
","First of all, I've loved Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Signs and found The Village just so-soBut this one is utter-bs. I mean the opening scene, just tells or warns use, this movie is going to be full of over-acting. And when you have entire cast over-acting or acting with weird faces, it tells us that director asked them to do it.
Obviously M. Night is not a bad director and he always tries to do thing differently and that's what I love about him, but in this movie he clearly misses it.The script didn't make any sense. Did M. Night read it? I don't why other reviewers here comparing it with Twillight Zone?I haven't seen Zoey's any movie/show yer (500 days of summer is in watchlist), and she acted awefully in this movie. You can't tell by seeing her performance that she has seen people die, people's dead bodies, an apocalypse in last 24 hours. I don't why she was trying to play 'Resse Witherspoon'?Ending, I don't know, if this movie has one",Null,0,0,13 October 2018
Edge of Tomorrow," Bland third ruining a great movie!
","First two halfs are so awesome, that I almost gave it 10
It was interesting concept, and Tom Cruise was awesome in it.But the third half of finding Omega or alpha (whatever it was) just seemed boring as compared to the conceptBut still worth multiple viewing",Null,0,2,28 July 2018
Whiplash," A well-made, modern masterpiece
","JK Simmons and Miles Teller, put them in a drama movie with lots of dialogues heavy scene and monologues, and a solo drum performance, what you'll get, a masterpiece. I just want to see both of them again in a movie together.I've never been a huge fan of musicals. But it's not really a musical anyway, it's the story of a guy who knows who's good at something and an unlikely mentor who wants one protege to achieve greatness.This movie works for me because I can relate to Miles Teller's character, so many of us have seen ourselves very best at what we do. And then someone comes and gives us a reality-check, and says 'practice harder'. Anyone who wants to be best in his field will feel for this guy, but the movie works because it's not just about him. It's also about a teacher played by JK Simmons, who believes the worst words ever used are 'It's good' (I think so). This is what I believe in too, mediocrity is not acceptable. Though he has questionable methods for making his point but he is not there to make fans but find the best. And you can also relate to him.These two characters are the spine of this movie, without their performance, this movie won't have worked as well. But the director, Damien Chazelle directs this well-written movie with an amazing style. From the movement of camera to amazing editing, this movie is masterpiece. I know it's not for everyone, but those who can relate, this movie is classic.Rating: 10

It Chapter Two," 170 minutes long movie, filled with bunch of supposed to be scary hallucinations
","IT Chapter 2 was in my top 5 most anticipated movies of 2019 list. I guess it's impossible for movies nowadays to live up to the expectations unless their thinking mind includes Kevin Feige.I would have liked this movie a lot more, if it was 30-40 minutes shorter. I get it though, that team behind this movie wants to keep as much as possible from the book, but movie is just too long for audience keep the interest alive for already weakly built characters. I went into the movie without knowing the runtime, so after 2 hours I realised movie is still not close to ending, I opened my IMDB app and checked out the runtime for 'it' (no pun intended), and it was 2 hours and 49 minutes. And it's not like a lot of different things happens in movie, most of the time, kids or adults are alone somewhere and then they start see some crazy monster which scares and then they run away.The movie is clearly divided into 3 acts, even Mike spells it out for us during the last act, first where group re-unites, second where they split up and third where they reunite, again, to kill the Pennywise. And seriously I've no idea what that second act was. Like finding artefacts, which were random items from their childhood, seriously I mean how they even knew what was their artefact. I actually loved how the movie started, they give little bit of arc to each adult character and then when they meet supposedly for the first time in 27 years, chemistry was there. And credit goes to these amazing actors. They really were the MVPs of this movie. Sadly, movie just becomes weaker and weaker after that and during the last half an hour, I literally closed my eyes and waited for movie to end. And those last 10 minutes, where they were monologuing in slow motion felt like longest time of my life.I know I'm being harsh, but that's how it felt. Though movie has its plus too. The cast is really fantastic. Special effects (and there are many of those) are really done well. One scary scene really got me where Beverly went to her old home (if you've seen the movie, you know which one I'm talking about). There are many jump scares too.Overall this movie didn't live up to my expectations and that's mostly because of pacing and runtime.",5,1,1,9 September 2019
Murder on the Orient Express," Source material is not right fit for A Movie
","Really, I loved the book. But the way it was written, it was hard to in-corporate it into 120 min movie as there are almost 15 characters. Now with time-constrains movie was able to focus on only few characters or moments and even the last revelation seemed way forced. For someone who have not read the book, the movie is gonna seem very odd.If it could have been a mini-series each episode focusing on 2 characters interrogation like in book, it could have hit the Homerun.Though, is it still too late? HBO, Showtime, Lifetime?Awesome cinematography btw",Null,0,0,28 July 2018
Blade Runner," I can't watch a beautiful painting for 1h 57 minute
","I get it, it's cult classic. But seriously, what was the point of the movie.I watched it in 2019, so yes, a lot of movies have taken 'inspiration' from it which I've already seen, so it's obvious some part will look dated. But I loved movies like Godfather and Star Wars, even though many movies have done exactly what those movies have done.My point is, Blade Runner seems takes itself too seriously, that it becomes monotonous. In some scenes, nothing happens, the camera moves from one furniture to another. It looks cool, yes, and maybe that's why it got popular back then, but it is not enough for the aging of a movie. This movie, for me, hasn't aged well. I took 8=10 attempts to finish the movie.I haven't watched the recent one yet, hoping it's better.Rating: 2
