Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Prudes! Stay at the coffee shop!
","Most of the criticisms of this movie are absolutely correct. What the movie boils down to is whether you liked it or not. And I loved it. That there are two layers to this movie is absolutely correct. That it was vulgar is also true. That it was slanted through the eyes of minorities(specifically Jewish) is also true. That it wasn't a good movie couldn't be further. And I'll tell you why! Borat is a lover of America and comes here childishly naive to explore the opportunities he has heard of. The Jews, Blacks and Gays are the only people who treat Borat kindly without trying to use or manipulate him. For everyone else who DOES try to bend Borat to their way of thinking-they end up disgusted or terribly embarrassed and look stupid. That is the comment. In an era where comedies have the same theme over and over-check out any will Ferrell, jack black, American pie, Jim Carey, jackass, etc- or nothing to say at all. I found this comedy refreshing. Finally! a comedian with balls!!!(no pun intended). And if still don't believe borat is funny...go see good luck chuck and you will!",9,3,6,4 October 2007
