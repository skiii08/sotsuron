Miracle," overall prefect movie
","how's it going everyone? i love this movie one of my favorites. Being born in buffalo new york and growing up in a family with a father thats played hockey since he was 7 and me myself playing since i was 3 i've been sorounded by hockey my whole life. I've been pounded with herb brooks, Freddy Shiro, the French Connection an all the other hockey greats so needless to say when this movie came out i was excited to see it. however before i went to see the movie i had some questions on wither or not it was going to be a tribute to herbie and his team or just a Hollywood screw up of an amazing story. well let me tell you it's anything but that. the way they capture herbie's ideas an his brilliance when it came to coaching hockey is incredible. they depict everything to a 'T' the way he chose his players, the way he got into their head, and overall the way he made them believe they could do something that really seemed impossible. The win those boys accomplished back in 1980 was nothing short of amazing an this movie shows you why. It shows you how the team strugled to come together an play to the best of their ability and overall how they would have never been able to do that without herb brooks.",9,0,1,5 June 2006
