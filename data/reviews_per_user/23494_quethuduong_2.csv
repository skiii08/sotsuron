The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Very good
","I don't understand why this movie received so many negative reviews. I have read the book and although I agree that Mockingjay shouldn't have been split into 2 movies, this part 1 is still very good. The story line is quite close to the book, plus good visual effects and great acting (Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson definitely nailed it in my opinion). There were some scenes that were very bitter and made me feel like breaking down. After watching the movie I just kept thinking about how dark it is and couldn't get the the image of Peeta out of my head. A lot of emotions indeed, and of course, can't wait until part 2 is released!",9,16,49,22 November 2014
Memento," How did this get an 8.5 I seriously don't understand
","Let me put this straight: This movie is simply boring. It is different from other movies and it does have a plot twist but it failed to hold my attention so when the plot twist was revealed, I didn't even bother to care anymore. The storyline is stupid, I don't understand why many people here say it's clever and entertaining, to me it's so so so boring, repetitive and pretentious to the point that I kept wondering: 'what is the point of all this when we all know the protagonist's final action already?' Oh and talking about the protagonist. He is an incredibly unbelievable character, at the beginning I thought he was supposed to be funny but after that when I realized he was pretty serious about his 'condition' and all the vengeance thing I lost interest and couldn't care less. The movie is only 1 and a half hour long yet the number of times I yawned while watching it was countless.",4,3,4,1 May 2016
