Mission: Impossible III," Strong Sequel
","From the opening scene this film had me hooked. The action is there the FX (ILM no less) are awesome, but the thing that amps all that up is how engaging the characters are. Hunt's private side becomes exposed to us and this made me care a lot more about him, his girl and importantly, the story. The villain, Davian, is genuinely unsettling, casting a shadow of menace over the whole picture and I expected the unhappiest of endings.JJ Abrams' directs the action with a lot of pace, but what's refreshing is what he chooses not to show at times. There's more of a sense of teamwork and infiltration in this that the previous sequel - thats a good thing. Better than M:I:2, probably better than the original - I'm off to see it again tomorrow!",8,2,4,4 May 2006
