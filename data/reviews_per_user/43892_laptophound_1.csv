Raiders of the Lost Ark," It's hard to believe Tom Selleck was offered lead role.
","Tom Selleck turned down the role of Indiana Jones because of a busy Magnum schedule, and VOILA....Harrison Ford becomes a star!As a young boy growing up, this movie was the symbol of adventure, forget wanting to be a cowboy, or police man....this movie made you wanna be just like Indiana!BEST SCENE: Indiana pulling out the gun to shoot the swordsman! Unexpected and hilarious! Still makes me burst out laughing everytime I see it! :o)",10,0,0,19 May 2000
