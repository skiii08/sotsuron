The Blair Witch Project," More annoying than scary.
","From the get-go, I found the female lead to be excrutiatingly hard on the nerves. As the movie took shape I wondered as to the ability of her co-stars to resist the temptation of ramming that camera down her throat - no violence to be seen but much imagined! From the opening scenes of the obviously prompted interviewees to either not look at the interviewer or hide their eyes behind sunglasses to the predictable character developments (the minions turning on the task master) to the oh so cliche finale in the deserted house (remember 'Silence of the Lambs' or 'Night of the Living Dead'?), this movie had little to offer but premise (read promise). One reviewer actually had the audacity to compare the confession scene with the likes of the 'Psycho' shower scene. I was more engrossed with the snot running from her nose! But congrats to those concerned for convincing so many that a masterpiece was born - albeit stillborn.",Null,2,4,4 May 2000
