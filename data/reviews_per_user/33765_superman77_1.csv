Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," highly under rated
","TPM is a brilliant film and does live up to my expectations. I absolutely love the first trilogy, so when i first watched Episode 1,My thoughts before watching it were that it couldn't be bad, as i love the whole concept of star wars so much. In my opinion it is just as good as the others. Many people say that it does not live up to the original and people are mainly annoyed because of the comic character, jar jar Binks. I think this character is fine as he helps Qui-gon jinn and obi-wan along the way and adds a small amount of humour to the film. And thats what hes for. Admitedly he is more entertaining for younger viewers, i remember loving him when i first saw it, at the age of 9, which is probably why i still like the character now. The idea of having Anakin as a small boy is a nice idea, as it shows us how good Darth Vader once was, and how much he changes, due to changes in his life. Ewan Gregor gives it his all and you can truly believe that he is the obi-wan kenobi from the original trilogy. I also loved Qui-gon, as it shows obi-wan as a padawan, not a master, so you can view him in a different light. Palpatine is brilliant, and I'm glad they kept the same actor from Return of the Jedi. He acts well, in the film, and it is a struggle to believe that he is a sith lord, making his way up to power. I love the way Lucas has done this, making him string the senators and Padme along until he is a chancellor, which he becomes, giving away nothing at all. We are left only with a small hint at the end of the film, when the camera moves along to his face, when Yoda and mace-windu, who is also an amazing character, are talking of the sith. Obviously, if you are a star wars fan you know whats going on, but if you are a first viewer, it gives no big clues. The action and special effects are a bonus, a brilliant, under rated film!!!!!!",10,7,9,28 May 2005
