The Ring," Disturbing and Thought - Provoking. **** out of **** stars.
","Rachel Keller is a single mother and journalist with a promising future until her entire world is flipped upside down by a videotape filled with disquieting images.After her niece, Katie, dies under mysterious circumstances, Keller (Naomi Watts in a stellar performance) begins to examine Katie and the final days of her life more closely. Only to stumble upon a legend involving a videotape which, after viewing, leads to a mysterious phone call where the recipient of the call is told he/she has seven days to live.Keller discovers the video, watches, and receives the phone call. Now she has seven days to unravel the mystery before death claims her life and the lives of those around her.As I mentioned before Watts as Keller delivers a superb performance. She carries the film effortlessly on her shoulders. But this I expected from the critically-acclaimed actress of 'Mullholland Drive.' What I did not expect, however, were the astonishing performances from the supporting cast. Especially the performances delivered by Martin Henderson as Noah, Rachel's ex-husband, and the underage talents David Dorfman and Daveigh Chase.Is 'The Ring' an excellent film? Yes (One of the best I've seen in quite sometime). Will everyone who views it enjoy it? Probably not. Will it disturb you in some way? Most likely. But, like the videotape featured within the film, 'The Ring' is much more than a series of disturbing images. It is something that can not be explained. Something unremarkably simple and, at the same time, utterly terrifying.",10,0,0,8 November 2002
