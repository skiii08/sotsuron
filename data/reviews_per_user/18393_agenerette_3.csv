Howl's Moving Castle," The Archetypes live and breathe in Miyazaki's workshop
","This movie will be compared to his other works and found lacking. Ah, well, people will write and say all kinds of things.The juxtaposition of and extended dialogue between Youth and the Aged; the blurring of lines between Hero and Heroine; the rhapsodic mixing of color and sound: this film is a chapter... a continuation.The submerged images of War simply left me agape. I can't think of another place, in film, where I've seen this kind of guide to healing from Conflict.There's a thing that was only sort of hinted at in Mononoke and Sprited Away. It was Nightmare, but it was something that needs to be looked at. Here, it's more fully rendered, but it's easier to handle: thanks to the earlier films.",8,0,1,22 June 2009
Pan's Labyrinth," One of the most perfectly beautiful movies I've ever seen
","Ofelia. She is Persephone, she is Joan, she is Iphigenia.Miyazaki's Chiro occupies the same space. I can think of no more affecting and effective renderings of the Archetypal Heroine. Actually, gender doesn't matter in this space. These are the greatest of heroes.Myth's are the dreams of a people; what I like to call Big Dreams. This film shines a bright light into places that exist deep inside all of us. It is a pure distillation of many of our greatest myths.We are in the hands of a great, great story teller here. There are elements of so very many giant stories; so many things that make me think of James Frasier, Joseph Campbell, and the Epics that I read many years ago. All of the great tales include, for instance, a scene or scenes in which the hero makes a descent into the under/other world: the world of the collective unconscious. 'Nuff said.The mere sight of images like the one of Ofelia, dressed in red and gold, in the other-world, at the end of the film: they break my heart every time I see them. Over the course of the film, it becomes apparent that she IS the very character that most of us believe she's dreamt up. It's pure, absolute Magic!The colors, the themes of under/other world, father/monster; of the conquering power of Seeing...This movie is perfect. I'm changing my initial 9 rating to a 10: the only one, I believe, that I've given on this site.",Null,2,4,8 September 2011
Twilight," I have only one complaint:
","Language.Edward is supposed to be close to 100 yrs old, Carlisle's older. We should hear at least a few antique words, every now and then, from them, no matter how they might be trying to fit in. Stephenie Meyer used a few in her books, like 'sanguine'... that one works. If you read a book like Will Self's 'My Idea of Fun', you'll find that this is one of the things that really cranks up the creep factor with (in that book) The Fat Controller.Anyway, I read the 1st three Twilight books last year and didn't want the story to end, so I put off reading the last one 'till now. I'm a Romantic. 'No apologies. After seeing the film, I couldn't stand it any longer: I had to dive into the dusty copy of 'Breaking Dawn' that's been sitting on my night table stand for months now.I was all prepared to not like this movie. I was even telling myself I didn't like it very much as I was watching it... then I realized, a day later, that I'd watched it three times.Part of what drew me in, initially (with the books 1st, then the movie), was the setting: anyone who's been there knows that most of the movie was obviously filmed in and around Portland, OR. (Cannon Beach, the Three Capes, Multnomah Falls), but the entire Northwest is hauntingly beautiful. Just the thing for this kind of story. A few words more words on this: 'Twin Peaks'... Neko Case.Kristen and Robert are perfect as Bella and Edward. Period. I can't believe the folks responsible for it actually managed to find them. I also like Taylor as Jacob, but I'm with Charlie on Alice: Damn! Ashley Greene is a little more than perfect in this part. We're talking Gloria-Graham-level HOT, HOT, HOT! But, back to the language thing: did I miss it or did Kristen/Bella not say 'Holy Crow!' once in this movie? Jeeze, I know it might have been tough for the oh, so serious actress, but you gotta just let go and give in to your inner geek every now and then! Ya know?",6,0,2,13 December 2009
