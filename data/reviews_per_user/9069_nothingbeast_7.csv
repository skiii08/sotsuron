Gremlins," Large numbers of confused parents!!!
","When this movie first came out, a lot of parents made the fatal mistake of thinking it was a cute, children's movie. In fact, it was this movie and 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom' that prompted the film industry to create the PG-13 rating. This one only got a PG.My mother was one of the parents who confused the movie as one suitable for children.Needless to say I was horrified by this movie as I was only 4 years old. This movie caused me to be severely afraid of the dark for many years. Yet, strangely enough, I wanted to watch it every year at my grandmother's house at Christmas time. It was tradition.I think that if parents knew what they were getting into, this wouldn't have been as big a movie as it was, and would probably have been lost among rummage sales, and good will donations as a movie nobody wanted.I love this movie, and it takes me back to when I was a frightened little boy, who was too scared to check under the bed when he heard those strange noises in the middle of the night. Almost 20 years later, those old scars still haven't healed completely, and sometimes just seeing 'Stripe' on the cover will send chills down my spine and prompt me to move to a room with better lighting.That's damn good film-making. Freddy Krueger didn't even do that to me.I do get a kick out of the fact that every once in a while, the Disney channel will play this movie around the holidays.Hoyt Axton's monologue at the begining trys to bring us into the movie by being the 'story-teller' but during the movie, we trick ourselves with 'it's only a movie.' Ending it with Axton's end monologue drags us back into the movie, leaving us with the though... 'There just might be a Gremlin in your house.'",Null,7,9,26 April 2003
The Fifth Element," My favorite movie
","Why do I say that? Because I've seen this movie more times than anything else.I love this movie. I love every aspect about it. The movie's style is unlike anything I've ever seen.I think it was a great move making the hero a cab driver. It reminds us that crappy jobs will always remain.I can't rave about this movie enough. I saw it in theatre's way back in 97 and have watched it every chance I had. Recently it's been played almost nightly on TV, and every time I come across it, I stop and put the remote down.Don't go into this movie expecting a MATRIX-like sci-fi movie (in the sense that sci-fi is dark and full of meaning that you have to look deeply to find.)It's supposed to be a fun movie. Why would the future be full of hypercolors if you weren't supposed to have fun with it? A lot of people are bad-mouthing this movie because of it's 'stupid' portrayal of the future. Well, who says it won't look that way? Personally I wish the ladies working at McDonalds looked like the ladies in this version of the future.I'll say it again, this is my favorite movie of all time. Another reason why? I have a tattoo of the 4 elemental stone symbols on my right shoulder.Yeah. I love this movie that much.I am a Trekkie for this movie. This is my Star Wars. I guess that makes me a 'Fifty.'",Null,0,1,18 April 2004
Finding Nemo," computer animation at it's best!
","Why does it seem like everything Pixar touches turns to gold?The animation is incredible. With the exception of every fish having 'human' eyes, I'd swear I was watching the Discovery Channel.This movie is nothing but fun. I do agree that very young children may be frightened by some of the more menacing fish (and there are some very menacing fish) but this movie has something for everyone.Mainly it's the heartwarming story of family and how parents and children learn to see things from each other's perspective.There is also alot of humor in this flick. I walked out with my stomach aching from laughing so much.The best looking scene would have to be the school of Jellyfish. The animation is dead-on realistic.One of the best family films i've seen in years.",Null,0,1,23 August 2003
Spider-Man," One of the best
","In a world where comics almost never translate well onto the big screen, Spiderman is a welcome surprise.Perhaps it has everything to do with the character. Spiderman is just a simple, average human, who is given his gift by accident. He's not an alien who gets a buzz from Earth's yellow sun. He's not a millionaire who witnesses his parents die at the hands of a thug.The acting is very well done, but more importantly the situations are very believable.The action sequences are very well done, from the fight scenes to Spidey swinging through the city. A very well done comic movie, that actually makes you feel like you're reading the comic on a much larger page.",Null,0,1,3 August 2004
The Matrix Reloaded," take a couple of aspirin before watching!!!
","Why, you may ask? My head hurt from trying to absorb all the info that comes from this movie.I'm not going to go into any details because this movie is still in theatres and not everyone has had a chance to see it. All I can say is PAY REAL CLOSE ATTENTION WHEN PEOPLE ARE TALKING. Theres a lot to absorbBut I thought this movie was awesome. Some people say it's considerably different from the first, but isn't a sequel supposed to be? Sure, it didn't seem to be as fun as the first, but it's still a damn good movie. The reason why it wasn't as fun as the first is because we don't have Neo learning as the movie progresses. What made the first movie fun was learning along side of Neo. Now that he's 'Superman' we sorta have to learn for ourselves.I'm going to see it again, and try to figure out what in the world was happening plot-wise. There was alot I didn't catch, but that's not the movie's fault. the 3 year old kid sitting next to me just HAD to go to the bathroom right when the IMPORTANT PARTS HAPPEN. He couldn't have held it for 2 minutes longer, or have gone during one of the super long (and super bad-ass) fight scenes. So I had to break my attention from the movie and let him and his dad get pass since the only seat available was on the aisle. I really hate parent's that bring their kids to the movies when they can't just sit and watch.I'd wait for a couple of weeks for when the crowds die down and then go see this flick. If you liked the first movie, this one is worth the ticket price.",Null,0,0,20 May 2003
Signs," Great the 1st time, a little less great the 2nd time.
","This is the type of movie that makes me wish there was a way to get inside your head and erase whatever you want.Signs was one of the greatest 'edge of your seat' movies i've seen in a long time. Just like in 'The Sixth Sense' when everything came together at the end, I was completely blown away. (i'm not like most people who  over analyze a movie while i'm seeing it for the first time just to prove to themselves how smart they are. I just let it roll and take me where ever it wants)When the movie ended, it was like I was on a drug. I was all excited and talkative like a child. 'I can't believe I didn't notice that!' and 'That was great how this and that went together!'However, once I knew the secrets of the movie, the second time I saw it, it had lost some of the magic. It was still a good movie, but didn't seem as fun the second time around.If someone could create a way for people to forget movies so that everytime you went to see it, it was like the first time, movies like 'Signs' and 'The Sixth Sense' would be so much more enjoyable.A great movie, but don't let anybody tell you about it. Plug your ears and run until you've seen it for yourself.",Null,0,1,23 August 2003
Donnie Darko," Needs a couple of viewings
","I love time travel movies that get it right. This movie? i'm not so sure did. There were a couple of holes, and questions that I had.Was this a bad flick? No. It was very entertaining.I'm not certain why this movie has become a cult-classic, but after watching it a couple of times I feel that it's a good movie.There's a lot of things going on in this movie, and you shouldn't watch it if you're expecting a phone call, or don't have a very good attention span.If you have the patience to sit and think, instead of one of those persons who needs everything spelled out for them (which are probably the people ripping this flick) then you'll enjoy it.",Null,0,0,20 September 2003
