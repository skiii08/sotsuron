Black Swan," Is there something wrong with IMDb ratings?
","I watched this film. It was a waste of two hours of my life. Nothing happens. The girl protagonist gets a lead role in a play she's been training for and cracks up. From time to time there's sexual hints and one or two explicit scenes, just to liven things up a little. Otherwise, this is monumentally dull. Very soft porn with nothing to it. Why did this piece of junk film get any kind of rating?This is akin to several other films on IMDb. They get ratings above 8 and the only explanations I can think of are that IMDb is the focus of marketing campaigns or that the whole world has taken a step back into the dark ages.",1,6,12,6 April 2011
The Dark Knight," Propaganda
","This film was a blatant piece of propaganda. If you can ignore that, it's quite entertaining. I found the propaganda in it an annoying intrusion on the escapism I was enjoying with it. In the original comic books there was little separating the good guys from the bad guys. Their roles were confused. In this film the bad guys were universally categorised as 'terrorists'. In addition, the film pointed out that it was justifiable to wiretap the entire population to catch these 'terrorists', and that the orchestrators of these violations of civil rights are dark unwanted heroes who sacrifice themselves for the safety the populace. The person or persons wanting to send this message does not understand his or her's own confusion, and it is insulting to the intelligent viewer.Otherwise, a good bit of violent fun with lovely special effects. Shame about the propaganda.",7,3,9,13 October 2008
