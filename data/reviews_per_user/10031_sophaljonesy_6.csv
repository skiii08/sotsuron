Ford v Ferrari," Excellent acting, exhilarating race scenes, relatable situations are what makes this movie absolutely ebtertaining
","I knew something great was going to come out from the pairing of Christian Bale and Matt Damon in Ford V Ferrarri and I was not disappointed at all. It had what I expected: interesting characters, great acting, thrilling car races. What I did not expect was corporate culture, which had Jon Bernthal play Lee Iaccocca. This added element made the movie even more interesting because you know the protagonists are already fighting an impossible task of beating Ferrarri while having to battle corporate interference. It is the battle between doers and the suits. Bale is one of the rare actors who transforms in every role he is and you immediately forget he was once Batman driving an insane Batmobile. The same goes for Damon and Bernthal. You completely forget Damon used to be Jason Bourne and Bernthal the Punisher. The funniest part is Bale's brawl with Damon as shown in the trailer. I like how Ferrarri is not vilified in the movie, since I am a Ferrarri fan. But on the other hand I truly root for Bale's Ken Miles and Damon's Carroll Shelby to win. This is a movie about two guys struggling to do the impossible while battling outside interference from non experts. This situation is very relatable. The race scenes are exhilarating. The soundtrack blends with the action resulting in a pulsepounding thrill ride. I am even more amazed that this is a true story, but am sure that without the capable directing by James Mangold, and the excellent performances brought by Christian Bale and Matt Damon, this movie would definitely fail.",9,2,3,17 November 2019
Us," Chilling and full of surprises
","The trailer suggested a home invasion horror involving doppelgangers, but it is much more. Jordan Peele's Us is a full-on horror movie complete with scares, chills, creepy soundtrack, and blood. There is humor injected but the humor does not feel forced. The story is also very engaging, and you really want to know what happens next. I am amazed that Peele, whose comedy sketches I love could make such good horror. This is one of the few horror movies that really rouses my feelings till the end, and I would still want to pay to see it again.",8,2,3,27 March 2019
Avengers: Endgame," The biggest cinematic event of the year
","Avengers: Endgame actually manages to keep audiences pumped and delivered the thrills and action as expected. Here we see our favorite heroes coping with their losses during Infinity War, and how their ragtag team assemble for one final chance to get things right. Of course there are risks, and Thanos, being a true menace, we are always on edge to see how events will play out in the end.
There probably is no individual character arc, but we do see a collective arc in the evolution of the Avengers as a team. We also get to see our favorite heroes back in action, and Thanos as Thanos being Thanos (trying not to spoil anything here). In fact, I thought 3 hours runtime would be agonizing but it felt like any 90 minute movie. The first act seemed a bit slow, but the second act gets our pulses thumping because we saw what had happened to half our heroes the last time, and the third act is an epic battle worthy of all the wait. There is a balance between drama, action, and comedy. However, for me the action scenes are brilliant and the Russo brother manages to show the capabilities of our heroes in full. As part of a massive narrative, it works perfectly. But as a stand alone movie, you will not get the full experience. That said, I wonder what's next for the Avengers.",8,0,5,28 April 2019
1917," A gruelling war, adventure that balances action with great performances.
","1917 is a truly riveting war movie about a messenger who has to brave through enemy lines to deliver a message. The plot sounds boring, but being a war movie, you can expect a lot of action. The choice for long shot was good because the audience is there with the character and fully sees the world from the protagonist's point of view. This limits the visual scope and creates suspense. There are indeed many suspenseful moments. Sam Mendes brilliantly captures the grimness and unpredictability of war amidst plush scenery. Though our character is sent to prevent a rash attack by British soldiers, through the journey we can feel the exhaustion and just want our hero to escape alive and forget about the mission. The performances were great, needless to say. These are men in battle at the spur of the moment, and the time span is practically the runtime, so there is no time for detailed character exposition or development. What is seen is what you would see from a real person. Of course you may note that all British characters are decent people, even in face of death. So there is some idealization of World War 1 British soldiers. Interestingly, German soldiers are portrayed as people out there to fight, and they are human too. One even has a name. 1917 is a gruelling war adventure movie that balances action, spectacle, and drama. A definite must watch for all",9,0,1,16 January 2020
Midsommar," Harrowing and unsettling
","Midsommar is a truly unique movie that is unsettling and harrowing to watch. Our heroine Dani is trying to cope with her grief while her boyfriend Christian is ambivalent about his relationship. As they join some friends to visit Sweden, they participate in the village festivity only to find out it is not what they expect. Like the characters, this movie delivers a try unexpected experience. All scenes are beautifully shot: the landscape, the dances, and the interior shots. The score and musical performance in the story convincingly makes you drop your guard and feel at home, yet the quiet stillness and vastness of the setting provides an unnerving atmosphere making you feel domething is off. What adds to the horror is even horror scenes are shot in a lustrous backdrop. The performances in the movie is excellent and even the cult members are believably charming. They even seem normal, which makes it even more disturbing when the movie reaches its climax. I am amazed at the music performed by the actors and the singing. They actually sounded good and could have made for a great musical if Ari Aster had chosen. The flaw would be the plot and lack of character investment but Ari Aster's masterful direction draws you to the events and you are as spellbound as the characters. Though the movie features some gore, it is used very judiciously. But for me the most terrifying aspect of the movie is how even the most beautiful setting could be used to create such horror. I am not sure if others would like the movie but it took me an hour to recover after watching it, so I highly recommend watching this movie before arriving upon any judgment. This is a movie to be viewed and experienced.",9,3,7,6 August 2019
It Chapter Two," Louder and more action-packed
","This instalment has a marvelous cast, and everyone, including James McAvoy (because he is James McAvoy), was great. But Bill Skasgard is the true star and does not disappoint one bit. Though he is not creepy, he is a fullblown murderous entity out to eat kids. There are many jump scares, and the loud sounds make the movie particularly jarring; making the horror more enjoyable. It has less character exploration than the first one, and less creepy, but it is an all out monster fest in the end. The movie seems to drag, and could have been a standalone movie without having to feature the previous casts. Though the decision to do so was to connect the story with the furst instalment. But it dragged the story and felt repetitive. The only backstory that was effective was James McAvoy's character, provided good character motivation. In short, the movie was fun, the casting was great, though the story coukd have been leaner.",8,4,6,8 September 2019
