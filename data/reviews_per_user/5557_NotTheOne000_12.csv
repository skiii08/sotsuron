Blade Runner 2049," And when we become Gods...
","Androids in sci-fi movies have been around for almost as long as the genre, dating back to Metropolis in 1927. They have been monsters and angels, standing in both for the cruelty of humanity at its worst and the naïve purity of humanity at its best. They have been a mirror against which we can reflect ourselves and ask what it is to be human. And they have been a warning to us - a Do Not Cross line for what happens if we give in to our hubris and play at being God.The first Bladerunner movie is designed to challenge our sense of what it is to be human. This was a central theme for Philip K Dick, whose stories twist our perceptions of what it means to be conscious, sentient entities. Deckard's portrayal in the first movie draws us in with his apparent humanity. In the end, we are left wondering if it really means anything to be born human as opposed to be an artificial version of a human. Our realities are creations of either ourselves or someone else. As they are all a fiction, does it really matter who writes that fiction? But all these stories of robots come from a different era, a time when artificial humans were thought possible, even plausible, but still the stuff of fantasy. Even AI such as Hal in 2001 were thought experiments, and performed the function of stripping back the human soul. But that era is now past. Bladerunner 2049 doesn't need to be a metaphor for anything, or a model of humanity to be dissected, because its subject matter is right around the corner.What Bladerunner 2049 does is something both obvious yet profound. Up until now, one universal element of any story like this has been the underlying question of 'what right have we to play God?'. That question is usually answered with some form of natural or poetic justice leading to the punishment of the hubristic humans taking more power than they're entitled to. Playing God is reserved for actual Gods, humans should not be assuming that level of power. This film dismisses that question out of hand and asks a much more relevant question, namely 'when we have become Gods, what sort of Gods will we be?' Will we be Wallace, the arrogant Old Testament God who treats his creations as his property, to dispose of as necessary to appease his Will and fulfil his Great Plan? Or will we be Joshi, the powerful yet generally benign God who is obviously superior yet is still respectful of the inferior mortals? And what of the androids and AIs in Bladerunner 2049? In previous films, androids have been one of two things - either definitely not human or very nearly human. The artificial intelligences in this film are different. They're definitely not human, yet they're still sentient, feeling, self-aware entities. Again, we are asked a much more relevant question: what rights do we humans have over our artificial creations. Do we have a right to deny a computer mind a physical human-like form if it wants one? Do we have the right to imprison it within a house and just switch it off or destroy it on a whim? And of those living creations that can walk around and think for themselves - do we have a right to deny them the ability to procreate? And if they are able to procreate, do we have a right to control that procreation?Bladerunner 2049 is the very, very best of sci-fi. It does not speculate far into the future, it does not abstractly reflect upon the nature of our humanity and it does not offer us a moral lesson in the form of a fable or fairy-tale. It challenges us to look at exactly who we are right now and asks us what we are going to do with the power we have gifted ourselves though our technological achievements. The Ks and Jois of Bladerunner 2049 will exist in the not to distant future, quite possibly within our lifetimes. As we are to become their Gods, what sort of world should we create for them?",10,1,8,30 October 2017
Deja Vu," Nineties man trapped in self-contradicting time travel film
","When making a time travel action film you have a choice to make. Is it going to be daft but entertaining fun (eg Timecop) or is it going to be an intellectual science fiction film that pursues deep philosophical points about determinism and free will (eg 12 Monkeys)? If you take the first path, then you can pretty much mess around with time-lines and ignore contradictions and paradoxes - time travel is simply a plot device. If you follow the second path, then you really have to make sure the plot is tight and there are no mistakes.Unfortunately, Tony Scott and Jerry Bruckheimer go for the latter but only have the ability to produce the former. The result is a film that on the surface seems intelligent, but as the story progresses fills the intelligent viewer with a growing sense of things not making sense until all suspension of disbelief is lost. The messages are confused: the philosophical stance of the film is to suggest that dictatorial spoilsport science tells us that there is no such thing as free will. Fortunately, so the film tells us, having faith and believing in God means that free will actually can exist. Washington believes he can change the future and so he finds he can... however, in a strange contradiction to this, the film produces the branching time-line theory to explain how time travel allows us to change the present in a way that is consistent with a deterministic view of the universe! Does society need faith to choose its own future? Or is it just that we're all following the wrong theory of how time works? The film is inconclusive - and not deliberately (which could work!), but because the screenplay writer(s) obviously didn't see the contradiction.Ironically, this reveals much about mainstream US cultural attitudes to science and spirituality. So, the bad guy in the film believes that everything in the future is already decided. Then the 'dogmatic' scientist overcomes his disbelief in the possibility of altering the present because he believes in God. However, the pretty black female scientist (ie, non-conformist who we should identify with because she is not trapped by the scientific atheist conspiracy) presents a clear physics reason why all this is perfectly explainable through normal cause and effect. The film justifies this blatant contradiction by implying that the theory she suggests is outside the mainstream of science. This is a common attitude, especially in the US (where the citizen believes they have an absolute right to believe what they want irrespective of reason or evidence) - the desire to keep life mysterious (and so allow the belief in God or ghosts or whatever) crashes up against the need for an explanation of everything in the context of a technologically advanced society and creates this strange kind of 'non-conventional science' which both explains everything yet allows the individual to maintain his or her unscientific spiritual beliefs. Intelligent Design and Scientology are prime examples of this kind of non-conventional 'science'. The non-conventional science suggested here is clearly not well understood, because it doesn't require the existence of free will to allow the changing of the present.There is also one really big error - BIG SPOILER ALERT - and that is with all the stuff that happens in the woman's flat when Washington jumps back in time. When examining the woman's apartment before Washington jumps back, his forensics pal says that Washington's fingerprints are everywhere. However, this is not possible in the branching theory of time travel. The version of time that Washington observes through the high-tech surveillance system is the original branch of time (where the terrorist blows up the boat). The problem is that everything that happens as a result of his time travel is in the NEW branch of time. In the old branch Washington has no effect on the events leading up to the terrorist attack (we know this because the attack is successful) yet we are told that his fingerprints are in the apartment and we can work out that the woman calls his office. This is stuff that can only have happened in the NEW branch of time - otherwise the explosion would not have happened in the original time-line and the whole story could never have happened. In other words, the screenplay uses the tricks of a time travel story to illicit surprise and spine tingling moments of realisation but fails to be self-consistent. Despite this, the film could still have worked as a good action flick. I've enjoyed plenty of preposterous action movies that have a dynamic driving pace and interesting characters. However, Scott's style is now outdated - a decade ago he could get away with laying the emotion on so thickly because the action was so BIG. Things have changed now. In the age of ultra-fast action and ultra-realistic fight scenes, Scott's directing lacks bite and drive and in places feels quite pedestrian. Compared to Casino Royal, which also has a rubbish story, watching this film sometimes feels like wading through a river of syrup. Add to this the over-emoting of Washington and it is hard to care for the characters. Modern action heroes are hard-edged and cold, only displaying emotion in moments of weakness. Scott's hero is very much a 'new man' of the nineties and so is passé.So, the film pretty much fails to succeed on all levels. It feels like it should be a an exciting movie, but it isn't. It feels like it has something to say, but it doesn't. The film isn't really bad in any way, it just isn't good in any way either. It is clear from the film that Scott can direct - he just needs to move into the twenty-first century and stay away from the intellectual stuff.",6,3,6,18 July 2007
Interstellar," A fairy-tale from the future
","Spoilers, of a sort, beneath the line.---Arthur C Clarke once wrote that any technology, sufficiently advanced, is indistinguishable from magic. Take this to its logical conclusion, and any sci-fi film with sufficiently advanced scientific concepts is indistinguishable from a fairy tale. That's what this film is. Do not challenge the science. Do not question the logic. Instead, seek to understand and appreciate the deeper meaning. The narrative is a framework for ideas about love. It's not sci-fi of galactic travel and relativity, it's sci-fi of the human soul.The Nolan brothers' message is a simple one. The love that ties us together exists in a very real, very objective sense. The limited forms by which we express love are the Morse code through which we communicate information held within our deeper personal realities. Our emotions are an unconscious realm beyond the Event Horizon, a place we cannot see into, consciously, from outside but which we can experience if we are not afraid of entering that part of ourselves without fear of what will happen to us. Love is an emotion that allows our inner selves to travel across galaxies and both backwards and forwards in time, not in a metaphorical sense, but in a literal sense. Each one of our personal existenceses is as much a construct as any other: observing reality is what makes reality real for us. We experience emotional reality and so that reality also exists within our personal universe. And our emotions are not things of the here and now. They exceed the limitations of the simple physical dimensions. Two objects cannot communicate across the Universe, but love links people together no matter how far apart they are. Emotions do not obey the rules they evolved to serve and utilitarianism is a period of human evolution we have outgrown. Rather our feelings inspire us, not just to survive and protect those we love, but to define what it means to survive and what it means to protect those we love. Emotion is the fifth dimension to our human reality.This is the most profound film of our generation.",10,0,3,26 August 2015
The Village," M Night: genius and subversive
","M Night Shyamalan is an allegorical director  this is the thought that must be remembered whenever you go to watch one of his films. Unbreakable, for example, is not a film about a man who realises he has super powers; it is actually a story examining the relationship between a man and his wife and son, and the relationship between the individual and his or her more general relationship with society.So it is with The Village  look at the details: 1) All the inhabitants are white and middle or upper class. 2) There is no alcohol or pre-marital sex. 3) There is no rock or rap music or TV or internet.In other words, The Village is an idealised modern gated community of the type springing up all over the US.So: dangerous towns = urban life invented monsters = imaginary paedophiles and drug dealers bad colour = blood  the obsessive fear of any kind of physical harm Ivy's blindness = blindness to fear, which allows her to see what people are really like inside Lucius's bravery = an ability to overcome fear, this affords him the desire to explore the world The watchtowers = the creation of unnecessary security measures to further strengthen the fear needed to control the villagers Noah donning the monster's robe = the real dangers often come from within our own community, and grow out of ignorance, of jealousy and even, sometimes, love.One of the most significant points is made when Ivy leaves the Village and is surprised by the kindness of the young guard she meets. The only genuinely altruistic act of the entire film is carried out by a total stranger, who provides help to Ivy for no gain at risk of loosing his job. This is M Night telling us that goodness of heart does not come from indoctrination, but comes from normal human nature.In other words, rather than a failed horror film with an intrusive twist at the end, The Village is actually an intelligent commentary on the lies and deceits that neo-con white middle class America is perpetrating on its youth out of unjustified fear in a desire to engineer an ideal community based on ignorance and naiveté.Unfortunately, mainstream Hollywood has become so devoid of genuine imagination and intelligence that it can't spot genius when it is right under its nose. 10/10 from me.",10,9,19,11 February 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Masterpiece
","It is a hazardous business, watching much anticipated films, especially when those are based upon greatly loved existing works - the new Star Wars films or the Judge Dredd movie are good examples. When it comes to a work that touches people so deeply, everyone has their own very personal opinions about how things should look, about which characters or events are most important and about how many alterations are acceptable. Some hold that if the story is not to be re-created exactly then it should not be done at all; others hold that as long as the spirit of the source material is maintained we should accept any changes that are made.I am one of the lucky ones, as my vision of LotR and Peter Jackson's vision are remarkably similar. When I watched The Two Towers it was as though (with a few exceptions) my own imaginings had been sucked out of my head, polished, tweaked, filled out and generally improved, and then projected onto a giant white screen with Dolby surround sound accompaniment. I didn't mind the changes, and I didn't mind the fact that the film ends before the book does because I was too busy falling in love with the second part of what I consider to be the greatest cinematic work of all time.Citizen Kane? Unimaginative! Star Wars? Old Hat! I know this will sound really tragic, but there were points during the film (and also, I found, when watching the extended DVD version of The Fellowship yesterday afternoon) where the vision before me was so exquisite and captured so well my understanding of the book that I worried I would embarrass myself by bursting into tears! To put it simply, there may be a few other films that achieve to greater effect individual aspects of this film, but as a whole experience LotR is, to me, simply without equal; no other film even comes close. This realisation of Tolkien's great classic is the pinnacle of a hundred years of film making, and I would compare it with the Sistine Chapel, St Peter's cathedral or Beethoven's Midnight Concerto as one of humanity's truly great artistic creations.I do feel deeply for those fans who do not find Jackson's interpretation as wonderful as I do, and I am sorry that some do not see him as the great visionary that many others do. All I can suggest is that next time you watch the Two Towers, try and forget the details of the plot - ignore the alterations and the differences in interpretation and try to remember how you felt when you first read the books. Hopefully, with time, you will learn to love this film as much as I do.",10,0,0,3 January 2003
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," This isn't the Star Wars film you're looking for
","I like films. Actually, I really like films. I also really like TV and I really like novels. I like drama, action, fantasy, I like low-budget art-house films where nothing happens, I like gore-fests and I like psychological horror.In all these genres, I have very high standards. Yet I can love a cheap-as-chips horror film as much as I love a glittering, star-studded Oscar winner. Why? Because every film should be judged on its own merits, in the context of what it is trying to achieve and according to the traditions of the genre in which it exists. If I'm watching a Malaysian action film, such as The Raid, I judge it on the basis that I should expect to see lots of seriously shot, highly choreographed violence, a simplistic storyline and some throwaway stuff about familial betrayal. If I'm watching a film about the nature of the interlinking of humanity with itself, the animal kingdom and the world, through the human senses, such as Upstream Colour, I'm happy with very little action but lots of juxtaposition of sounds, visuals and emotions.And if I'm watching a Star Wars film, what I'm pretty much exactly looking for is a Star Wars film. The Last Jedi is not that at all.The reason many critics love the new Star Wars film is exactly the same reason why so many fans hate it. The Last Jedi takes the very specific sensibilities of the original trilogy and throws them out the window. It takes a series of films that are, at their best, exquisitely made, ground-breaking genre pieces and presents us with an easily accessible, bog-standard sci-fi action movie. It appeals to the lowest common denominator (i.e. non-genre fans), and the critics run with it because they know how to evaluate bog-standard sci-fi films. The critics feel at home with The Last Jedi in a way they did not feel at home with, say, The Empire Strikes Back (which garnered lots of negative reviews upon its release). Just as they felt at home with Arrival in the way they didn't feel at home with Starship Troopers (the former being an arty film that happened to have a sci-fi theme, the latter being a film that both gloried in and yet also subverted a low-brow sci-fi sub-genre and confused the hell out of the critics in the process). The Last Jedi is a perfectly serviceable contemporary action movie, complete with diversity, messages and all that stuff. It ticks lots of boxes for the film critics. But unfortunately, the director is so enamoured with his big brain, he decided he didn't need to respect the source material. It's rather disappointing that despite so many years having passed since Star Wars' release, so few critics appreciate where the artistry lies in the original trilogy. The simplicity of the stories, the casual, natural intimacy between the main characters, the purity (bordering on naivety) of the messages of film, the fact that everything is presented at face value and nothing has to mean anything more than you want it to... all these things are lost in The Last Jedi. In their place we have contrived relationships, forced messages, and a complete lack of authenticity. All well-and-good for a trying-to-be-smarter-than-it-is Disney flick, but just not good enough for Star Wars. The OT Star Wars was high concept film-making at its best, but what we have now is the opposite. The critics love low concept movies, which is fine, but it's not the point of Star Wars and they really should be able to understand that. Yes, the OT Star Wars films had their inherent limitations, but the people behind those films pushed up to the very edge of those limitations. The latest edition tries to do more by blasting the limitations away, but ends up achieving a lot less as a result.The Last Jedi: 6/10.
Critic's response to The Last Jedi: 1/10.p.s I've seen quite a few comments along the lines of 'I never really got into the Star Wars films, but I love this one', even from some critics. To some, that means bringing Star Wars to a new audience, but in reality it just means selling out. Has cinema really become so artistically bankrupt that it's now seen as a good thing for a franchise -owner to burn away a highly-regarded creative work's foundation in the name of putting new bums on seats? No wonder TV is where all the talented creatives are right now!",6,2,3,22 December 2017
Arrival," Ersatz intellectual sci-fi that thinks it's deeper than it is
","On paper, I should have loved this film. Slow-paced sci-fi with little Blockbuster action, based around well-drawn human characters... what's not to love? Well, first the good. The acting is excellent, the cinematography is great, the dialogue is good too. It's a very well executed piece of film-making in many regards, and will be loved by many cinema goers.However, the film has one big problem.The essential component of any good 'soft' science fiction story is that it allows us to examine the human condition in novel ways. Through the use of allegory, we can take apart our real-world behaviour and examine it in a new light. District 9 does this, Moon does this, 2001 A Space Odyssey does this (though you have to read the book to see it properly), and Ex-Machina does it particularly well. This film fails completely.Arrival presents one very big ethical dilemma (which I won't reveal) and then dismisses it pretty much out of hand, failing to address the real emotional challenge and the genuine moral conundrum it poses. Worse than this, it ducks the dilemma by invoking gender stereotypes - women are unable to face hard decisions and will passively sacrifice themselves to their soft, fluffy feelings and end up going with what was meant to be, while men will react to any difficult situation with anger and stone-walling to the point of damaging their relationships because, you know, that's what men do. There is no challenge to this behaviour, no revelation that it doesn't have to be this way, no attempt to suggest that actually women can make the hard choices or that men can have a deeply compassionate side that reaches beyond the 'me man, me protect'. The characters do not take a personal journey, and do not learn anything about themselves at all.Given the main character is a woman and that her relationship with her male companion is so integral to the piece, it was extremely disappointing to have what should have been the core of the film treated with so little consideration and given so little screen-time and so little gravitas. It's as though someone put a red pen through the most interesting and important scenes (I have not read the original story, so this is quite possibly what happened), or some film exec saw how well Interstallar was received and thought 'yeah, lets find us another one of those' and grabbed the first clever-looking sci-fi script that crossed his path.There has been comparison with some of the great sci-fi movies of the past. This film is no-where near as ground breaking in terms of its ideas or as rich in terms of the depth of its characters as those classics. It does not challenge us, it gives us the same old clichés and is more interested in the big reveal and the cleverness of its premise than the implications of these things. The film lacks authenticity, preferring to dazzle us with its assumed smarts than address the difficult questions. The irony is that if the exact same story had been told in the form of a Blockbuster, it would have been much more fun without losing out on any of the ideas! Disappointingly, only 6/10.",6,1,6,27 November 2016
The Dark Knight Rises," Bit of a let down
","It is interesting to note that the big difference between the IMDb rating of The Dark Knight, and The Dark Knight Rises is with the Male 18 - 29 and 30 - 44 groups. The former has very high ratings, but the latter simply has good ratings. I fall in the latter category, and have to agree with the lower average rating for the final film in the trilogy.Where TDK is a compelling parable wound around a philosophical battle between the Batman and the Joker, TDKR is a collection of obvious social and political messages jimmied into a traditional superhero flick. The action scenes may be good enough to please the under 18 audience - the main target for this type of film - but the overall package fails to rise above the genre. Where Ledger's Joker is possibly the most complex and commanding superhero film villain of all time, Bane lacks gravitas and charisma and any subtlety that may exist in the comic-books fails to make it over to the screen.Having watched most of Nolan's films, I find that the main protagonists are often difficult to form a relationship with. This is deliberate. Nolan's Batman stands for an idea that is in many ways inhuman, or at least is a part of human nature that is cold and unfeeling, and was used perfectly in TDK. However, without a strong set of characters to add what Batman lacks, this inhumanity robs Nolan's Batman films of soul. The soul of TDK arose from the interactions between Harvey Dent, the Batman / Bruce Wayne, the Joker and Rachel Dawes. There was no meaningful emotional interaction between Bane and the Batman, and that is a fundamental flaw that prevents the film transcending its style.Nolan's films are deliberate constructions built up to be challenging on both an intellectual and emotional level. However, the target is often missed. Great film-making in of itself isn't enough for Nolan, which is admirable, but when he fails, those looking for something extra are left feeling let down. So it is with TDKR.",7,2,5,8 December 2012
Casino Royale," Good Bond, bad story
","Considering how bad most big Hollywood movies are, I am not surprised how high this film rates in IMDb 250 ranking. Casino Royale is well directed, well acted and well shot - Daniel Craig is especially good as Bond, capturing nicely the essentials of the idealised British bloke.However, I can see why it has taken so long for this book to be made into a proper Bond film. Yes, it is interesting to see the character of Bond as 007 develop, but the story lacks the structure needed for an exciting film and the climax is a big let-down. There is a section in the middle where the story really drags along and cutting out 15 minutes would have helped significantly. The bad guy character is poorly utilised and the back story of Bond's love interest is also misused.So, 7/10 mainly for the directing and the acting; as an example of good film-making it probably is the best Bond film of the lot. Having said that, as a rip-roaring, Boys Own action flick it is not anywhere near as much fun as many of the Bond predecessors - Goldfinger, Thunderball, Live and Let Die, The Spy Who Loved Me and Moonraker are all superior. It is better than all the recent films, though, and I am looking forward to the next Bond film with greater anticipation than since the last Roger Moore Bond movie came out.As a final point, I'd just like to say what a waste it would be to remake any of the old films. If the Bond makers can't find a decent new story then they shouldn't bother.",7,0,3,20 June 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," DVD's, Theatre releases and Oscars
","Just a note to film watchers, especially to fans of the book. This movie, along with all the other LoTR theatre movies, is not the finished item. Jackson knows what works well in box office terms and has crafted the cinema release of this film for the average cinema goer. The completed film that is designed to please die hard fans and film buffs has not yet been finished, and will not be released until November 2003. As a result, those who know the story well will feel bits are missing, and those who understand the art of editing may feel that scenes do not run together as well as they might.I am starting to wonder if perhaps the idea that the 'best film' award at the Oscars should be constrained to theatre movies is soon to become out-dated. With movies increasingly using alternative media to fill out the cinematic release (and not just as a way to make money), perhaps it is time to start considering DVD releases and movie concepts. For example the Matrix trilogy is supplemented with TV shorts and video games, which add to the story and the depth of the film. OK, it may not have worked too well in the end, but it won't be the last or best of its type. Maybe there should be a separate award for everything that a movie encompasses; a sort of 'multi-media concept' or 'best movie event' or something. This could judge theatre release AND DVD version, as well as well as looking at the use of the video games to compliment the film and use of TV features to expand the storyline.With the video game industry now outgrowing the movie industry and with the new innovations that are revolutionising the way we understand the movie experience it seems a shame to limit the appreciation of a cultural item such as LoTR solely to what appears on the silver screen.",10,0,0,18 December 2003
Annihilation," Remembering what it's like to not understand
","In Iain M Bank's novel Excession, one of the sentient super-intelligent spacecraft observes:'An Outside Context Problem was the sort of thing most civilisations encountered just once, and which they tended to encounter rather in the same way a sentence encountered a full stop.'And so when the alien asteroid / seed / spacecraft (call it what you will) lands on Earth, we encounter such a thing. Just as when the British Empire's ships landed on an isolated stone-age island, the humans of the film have no context in which to place the events unfolding, hidden, within The Shimmer. All the Earth-islanders know is that something has arrived which makes no sense, over which they have absolutely no power, and which entirely reshapes their core belief of being masters of their immediate surroundings.Only in Annihilation, the reshaping is not one of an encounter with a higher form of technology or scientific knowledge. It's a disassembling of the sense of explanation to which we have become so familiar. In an era where explanations, scientific or not, are just a screen-tap away, the ultimate shock to us is to be put into an environment where we cannot possibly find understanding - not even an invented one of Russian bot conspiracy theories. The sense of control over ideas that our technology has given us is deliberately cast to one side here.Garland has described his film as being the book remembered as a dream, and the narrative is true to that statement. Time jumps with no memories to fill in the gap. Characters simply disappear, with barely a thought given to them once they've gone. There is a sense that your body is not quite how your body should be. And understanding is impossible because real-world logic has been suspended. The casting itself is evokes the dream-like nature of the film. Existenz (Jennifer Jason Leigh), Westworld (Tessa Thomson) and Black Swan (Portman) all blur the boundaries between real and unreal.The film will divide critics and viewers. There is allegory, namely the inherent nature of self-destructiveness that is part of life, and the fact that life simply does what it does, be it human or alien. At the end of the interview between Lena (Portman) and Lomax (Wong), Lena says that the alien did not want anything and was not destroying, but simply changing things. That's also true of the greater arc of humanity. Human society, as an entity, has no sense of autonomy, and whilst it may look like we're destroying the Earth, the truth is that we're actually just changing it.However, the greatest strength of Garland's films is his willingness to confront the audience with realistic characters and avoid simple morality tales. To overcome her mirror self, Lena realises she can't defeat her reflection by brute force. Only through an act of guile can she win the day, guile which she has practiced through the deceit of her husband. It's not often we see the hero survive by exploiting character traits the contemporary audience finds unpalatable. It's a simple observation, that deceit is one of our species' most advanced evolved attributes - but it's one we do not like to admit.As for the ending? The prism of The Shimmer is the prism of human interaction. That great generator of invention, the chopping and changing, and cutting and pasting of ideas, thoughts and feelings that makes up the human experience. Lena is Lena, but something new has been added to her. Kane is alien, but some of Kane has been added to him. Both have changed, both have mutated, both have evolved.Annihilation is, in my opinion, one of the greatest Sci-Fi movies ever made. It's a literary film, and recalls the works of Kurt Vonnegut in its use of high-concept sci-fi story-telling as a framework for intimate existential human study. Whilst not as beautifully constructed as 2001: A Space Odyssey, it has a free-form and fluid feeling to it that Kubrick's controlling style prevents. The ending to Annihilation may not be as explicitly profound as 2001, but it's philosophically subtler. More art-house than smart sci-fi in its denouement, Annihilation is closer to the simultaneously enigmatic and visceral styles of Shane Carruth's Upstream Color or Jonathan Glazer's Under The Skin than the beautifully meticulous artifice of Denis Villeneuve as seen in Arrival or Blade Runner 2049. It is, therefore, far more challenging.Paramount did well to pull the film from international cinema markets. It does take a while to get going, and most viewers will lose interest before the pieces come together. It's not really an audience-friendly film, to be honest, and if you've read my review this far and enjoyed the film as much as I did, you're probably, like me, the most pretentious member of your circle of friends. Anyway, whilst I wish I'd had the chance to see it on the big screen in the UK, it would have been branded as a flop and that would have been a great tragedy. In a parallel universe where Oscars are given for artistic merit, this film would sweep the board. If it's lucky, in this one it'll get a handful of token nominations.Thank you Netflix, btw.",10,3,9,15 March 2018
Alien: Covenant," Some things are better left unsaid
","So, Prometheus ends. Not a bad film... not a great film, but not a bad film. But the one thing it does do is leave us with a sense of anticipation. We're going to meet the Engineers! And Shaw and David are going to do something really exciting and possibly quite interesting, and we'll see their relationship evolve and explore some interesting ideas about human-as-creator and how creations can be flawed!Oh, wait, no we're not. Because Shaw is already dead by the time the film starts, David has been transformed into a two-dimensional Ubermensch narcissist with delusions of grandeur, and the Engineers have all been wiped out. A film's worth of set-up is dismantled in the space between two scripts. And what we're left with is a hackneyed story of something-or-other I can't even be bothered to delve into.There are plot-holes (the Engineer's just let this mystery ship fly over their only remaining city unchallenged?), dodgy CGI (the original Alien looked more real than the CGI one here) and stupid crew-members (why, oh why, did they not suspect David was tricking them?) and a twist ending that isn't a surprise to anyone other than the characters of the film. It isn't really that scary, and it isn't that exciting. David is nowhere near complex enough to justify the focus that's placed upon him. And, yet again, we see an Alien being blown out of an airlock (third time's the charm!).But what disappointed me the most is that Scott has undermined the key element of the original film. When Alien first hit cinema screens, it really was unlike anything we'd seen before. Geiger's creature was so different from the man-in-a-suit monsters that proceeded it, it really was alien. It was something so different, so strange, horrific and unusual, that the audience had no frame of reference. Now Scott has shown us that the Alien isn't actually that alien at all. It's just a bioweapon that was created by another species of humanoid and perfected by one of our own androids. Mystery explained.2017 was a bad year for franchise movies. Star Wars, DC and Marvel Universes, and the Alien franchise are all starting to feel very tired. We know too much about them all, so there are no surprises and no discoveries. They rehash old ideas, but can't match the original vigour, or they try to make the old ideas into something new and betray the original spirit. There are occasional one-offs that are worth watching, but they're the ones that break from the main franchise and may as well not be part of the franchises at all. And now there's talk of Blade Runner being brought into the Alien cinematic Universe...I guess there's still so much money in the franchise model that we'll see many more, however, I doubt very much that any of the franchise movies made in the last few years (and next few years) will occupy the same place in cinema history as the original Alien does. There are 18 sci-fi, superhero and fantasy movies in the IMDB top 100, many of which were early films in ongoing franchises. 5 of those 18 were made in the last 15 years, but none of those 5 are part of those original (now resurrected) franchises, and none of those 5 are part of the new, ongoing franchises. It really is a case of quantity over quality for sci-fi.",6,1,2,9 March 2018
