Whip It," At long, long last: A chick flick with balls!
","Right. It's light, it's a simple operatic plot, it's got relationships, it's got girly playfulness, it's got boy-girl issues, it's free-wheeling; no great complexity, no ethical conundrums, no earth-shattering moral crises.But what it has, it has in a deeply human way, thanks to the loving (yet artful) care obviously lavished on the acting, direction, and over-all production values. It's probably another case of a movie ably carried to a satisfactory culmination by dint of sheer artistic moxie.Highly recommended, and be ready to laugh from the very pit of yr gut, and have a hankie close at hand.",9,0,3,1 September 2010
The Avengers," Can't be great because the basic plot line is so tepid
","First off, you have to be naive way beyond Pollyanna to think that the orgasmically, hyperbolically glowing reviews were NOT churned out by a PR machine.It's getting easier to decide what makes a flick great or not. I was just rewatching Nights of Cabiria, and it's a great case for how a rock solid story and labor-of-love direction more than compensates for flaws in other areas.The problem with Avengers is that it's a hollow concept/myth ginned up with some admittedly clever writing and CGI. The difference is that, to me, the writing and production don't compensate for a lousy core plot line.The classic deus ex machina resolves inextricable gotchas in plot development: In Avengers, the deus ex machina is the villain, introduced at the beginning to set the plot in motion and give the writers a reason to get up in the morning. Loki touches people with a weird stick and they magically become his partisans; how lame could a plot point possibly be? I will again mention that, once forces contrive to bring our good guys into some kind of alliance, the writing is remarkably good; even enjoyable.But I have to mention a few more of my personal bugaboos.First off, being a sort of closet Discordian, my ears prick up when a 'troublemaker god' is maligned. Loki as an evil nemesis strikes me a bit incongruous. I like troublemaker gods! They keep us on our toes, and keep us from devolving into protoplasmic sludge. I don't like seeing the glorious tradition of troublemaker gods as agents of change being blasphemed like this.Next, look at Loki's statement of intent: He wants to take away our freedom, thereby making us free.** Why do I feel like I'm watching Dr. Evil ask for 'ONE MILLION DOLLARS!' all over again? Don't the writers know that human beings have been giving up their freedom to become free as long as there has been civilization? Are you in a relationship in which you've abdicated your principles for the short term gain of freedom from abject loneliness? Are you locked into an economic system that takes away more and more of your freedom? Haven't you already internalized the view that this kind of enslavement is freedom? Don't you pay taxes so that bombs can be dropped on benighted wedding parties full of men, women, and children who haven't yet bought into this precise species of freedom? The 'Loki' of this flick is laughably and lamely late to the game! You can see it's difficult to get behind the ensuing Sturm und Drang when there's nothing truly relateable at stake, on the table, in play.** BTW, revealing this info isn't a 'spoiler': It's the beginning point of the plot, not a revelatory middle or endpoint.",4,5,28,3 July 2012
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Anti-American?
","NOTE: I'm reposting a message board entry regarding alleged anti-Americanism in Borat. It wound up saying pretty much how I felt about the film, so I think it's worth posting as a comment, as well.------------ Yes, a lot of the hapless victims in the film are just 'being folks,' and people anywhere would respond the same way. When you consider it in a piecemeal fashion, there's no need to see this film as particularly anti-American.However.For one thing, I think people like to watch others doing what they do best. Cohen has an undeniable gift of comic verite chutzpah.I think this film is a kind of Rorschach. When you collide the aforementioned unmitigated comic cheek of Borat against all these features of 'normal' society, trinkets spill out. This film then lays them all out for our delectation, like a comic garage sale; everyone is going find something they'll want to 'take home' i.e., laugh at. For instance, I thought Borat's infiltration of a modern, 'charismatic' megachurch was priceless. We get to take it all in; the hint of twisted antiprogressive politics (ex. the church/state nexus), resentment of science, the bogus speaking in tongues. The film takes us places many of us will never go, and we get to bask in the experience.There are little 'inside' gems, like Borat's meeting with Alan Keyes. You can't really savor the situation unless you have some background on Keyes; his 'in-crowd' status with the fundies, his de rigueur doctrinaire stance on homosexuality, and his daughter having come out as a lesbian. There's a lot in this movie that rises like a heady aroma from the fecund loam of middle American culture. The scene at the rodeo is probably the basis for claims of an anti-American subtext. I've been to large social gatherings of staunch, nationalistic Americans, milked for patriotic fervor by play-to-the-crowd 'entertainers.' Given that, how hilariously cathartic and timely to see that scene with Borat.His scene in the civil war antique shop is either a bludgeon or a scalpel. You're going to love it or hate it. It's either poorly sublimated aggression, or it cuts the Gordian Knot. Your call.In short, if you analyze Borat, scene-by-scene, you'll miss something. Sort of like the Old Testament: If you analyze it scene-by-scene, you may conclude it's a load of rubbish (many do). But I feel that when you take it all in, the connections are made, and wisdom can be obtained. And real wisdom obtains you real benefits.There's something wise in Borat. That's the important thing.----------- Writing again, 12/16/2008I just realized that I think I can explain the wisdom and overall genius of Borat.It's a film fantasy on The Idea of a 'Great Nation.'That's all there is to it; really. Borat does to national pride what Python's Meaning of Life does to the search for life's true meaning.If you just keep that idea in the back of your mind, you'll see every scene weaves together into a larger brocade. If you stand back and look at the finished brocade, you'll see the clever hidden message, 'Wake up, America; the laurel branches dried up and all the leaves fell off, a *long* time ago.'And *that*, my friends, is the wisdom of 'Borat.' I presume he will take this distilled wisdom back to his home country to, uh, make better it.",Null,5,9,28 December 2006
Requiem for a Dream," a cinematic take on the whole drug vs. love thesis
","There's something about this movie that defies you to refrain from declaring whether you 'like' it or not.  And I'm not sure if I can put my finger on why.  Is it that the effort to capture everything (and I do mean everything) on film is a kind of recipe for cinematic autodestruction?  Or is it that the film was successful in delivering its 'goods', and that goal has nothing, but nothing, to do with 'liking' or 'enjoying' the product?  Or is it something else?Anyway, I *will* say that the film delivers an interesting thesis, and it IMHO is this:  That when you take all the drugs away from life, what you have left is love.  Corollary:  Everything that masks love is, by definition, a drug.  I can't say whether this is a particularly groundbreaking thesis or not.  I figure there's a very good chance it's been dealt with--perhaps even more effectively--by any number of prior cinematic efforts to deal with the drug issue [write me and let me know! -ed].  But this film certainly throws its hat squarely into that ring.I'm sort of reminded of the quintessential Vietnam movie as a kind of holy grail of filmmaking in the U.S.  That particular pursuit has come to strike me as a kind of obsession, with a feeling of each new entrant being yet-another headlong rush 180 degrees in the wrong direction (away from the probity necessary to healing).  The difference in this genre of movie (e.g., 'Requiem', 'Jesus' Son', et.al.) is that the pursuit seems more focused and honest, more like the pursuit of insight and true healing.  I wonder if 'Requiem' might be a kind of belated 'Apocalypse Now' of the drug wars.  To the extent that there's any basis for such an analogy, 'Requiem' bears a look.AFTERNOTE:  I was about to submit this review with no other comments.  Think about it:  Not a word about the acting, editing, script...nothing!  I would like you to take that as a positive comment; the acting, scripting, editing, etc. were fine, to the point of not needing or naturally eliciting comment. It's like Stravinsky said when someone asked if the attraction of Beethoven was in his voice-leading:  (paraphrase) 'Well, that's an ironic thing about voice-leading.  When it's absolutely perfect, it disappears as an attribute of the musical product.  The best voice leading defies being noticed.'  I feel that technically this film defies this kind of commentary.  But please don't take this to be a commentary upon my fitness to make such pronouncements!  I'm not really all that versed in these niceties of filmmaking!",Null,0,0,22 September 2002
Source Code," Folksy take on quantum physics and reality
","I dug Source Code. For one thing, it was a sort of funky take on the question of Free Will; that there's a discernible 'afterimage' to events, of which the crux can be derived as a kind of source code; and that the compiling and running of that source code can produce multiple possible specific outcomes. As with Groundhog Day, Colter is very much the Random Factor in that program. The one truly free man! I enjoyed it very much. The surprising thing was that, 'gimmicky' though it might be, it develops the storyline around the gimmick with aplomb and even a kind of verve; the writing is excellent.The backstory; of an ultra high-tech anti-terrorist program; at first sort of put me off. But I came to realize this movie was not a peon to rarefied, big-ticket technologies designed to save America from a comeuppance. It seems to transcend that, and so redeems itself on this point.Anyway, watch and enjoy!",9,0,0,25 April 2011
The Hangover," Colorfully boffo, not the stuff of classic humor
","Well produced, generally well directed, generally well-acted. The technical work and editing do help push the creaky old storyline along.The writing is so-so. The narrative structure is tepid, punctuated with precious few fleeting flashes of cleverness.In short, the writers/producers believed that over-the-top acting/directing could carry a movie with a narrative premised on a drug-induced 'lost night'. If there was some kind of brilliant twist or tour-de-force, it would redeem the exercise. Unfortunately, the development is a surprisingly prosaic, vanilla treatment of the premise.I know this approach works OK for some folks. I watched this on the recommendation of a guy I'd just met who seemed like a pretty smart fellow. But it turns out to have been a pretty tame product. If you expect quality narrative from a movie, skip it.",Null,1,3,21 September 2009
Hereditary," Not for me: Superb technically, lacking narratively
","Subject sez all, but here's some elaboration.Beautifully produced: Fantastic and captivating in every sense. But it runs off the rails about 1/2-way through. The simple way to describe it might be 'producers' cold-feet syndrome,' where the money people didn't trust that the flick's maintaining tone, plus the planned narrative end-game, would put butts in the seats and recoup expenses. So they just ran roughshod over the director and turned the thing into a weird spook house cavalcade. There was some tying together of the first and last halves of the flick, using the grandmom as a ligature, but I didn't buy it.Of course, there's a chance the film got made as planned, and the planning for the narrative direction was just screwed up from the get-go.The film's technical mastery starts out so great, I'd almost be tempted to advise that you rent it just to watch the first half. But in the end, ... that's a dumb idea. Forget I suggested it.I was looking forward to Byrne cutting another notch representing his contribution to another noble artistic effort! So sad!Sigh: Avoid it.",5,1,3,18 September 2018
Fight Club," After all these years, finally piling on
","Just watched it again. Checked my IMDb 'Reviews' list... surprised to see that I never got around to commenting on it!In a nutshell; one of those flicks that has a shimmering, gemlike mythology at its heart, and a Heisenbergian event cloud wildly thrashing about, to and fro, around that myth. The actual depicted events of the story often conflict, presenting sometimes rather smudged plot lines and character studies. Somehow, one finds occasional lapses in the storytelling. You can easily see how and why Fight Club was a popular punching bag for the cream of the cinema criticism corps. It is, plainly, a self-indulgent mess.But it has these saving graces: As stated above, it has a seductive myth at its core; the myth of the birth of an anarchist package deal, with praxis and theory seamlessly integrated. Beside that, you've got decent production values, a 'labor-of-love' feel, some great ensemble work, and direction that strangely errs on the side of _Sound of Music_- style cornball(!).But I still remember the feeling I had when I first saw this. I talked about it, with friends, for months. Was I just an impressionable youth? Sure. At least, it flatters me (sort of) to think of myself as having been a 'youth' at the age of 45!And watching it again, in 2015, I still sagely nod at key moments in the exposition. The mythology shines through like a nuclear blast through opaque film stock.Check it out.",10,0,3,7 March 2015
Memento," metaphor for spiritual blindness
","I had just read _Mere Christianity_ (C.S. Lewis) before seeing Memento and, between the two of them, it was a one-two knockout.I suppose I shouldn't be admitting this, but the movie convicted me of my own blindness.  I feel it explains the problem of evil in a way that David Lynch--for all his facility in constructing those clever, creepy little inbred tautologies of evil--could not.  Leonard's plight is our plight; running around creating havoc without meaning to, and for the same reason; because our sphere of perception is crimped.  But there is a silver lining to this dark cloud.  Whereas Leonard will probably never get a resolution to this root problem (will never 'heal'), we can get a resolution to the problem of spiritual blindness; we can 'heal.'  It's a struggle, but one that's worth the effort.  And I encourage all readers who are aware that they're struggling with their spiritual 'Leonardness'--they're cuss'd tendency to forget they ever cared to grow in faith, hope and charity--to continue the fight; think of all the Leonards who don't know they're Leonards.  Keep up that good fight.I found myself explaining the attraction of the film to a friend in the following way:  It doesn't discourage the U.S viewer from engaging on the usual level; you start picking out the white hats and black hats and prepare for the usual, cozy, process of watching your moral expectations achieve fulfillment, albeit with some twists and turns.  A lot of what passes for inventiveness or innovation in movie narrative has its locus in these twists and turns.  But ultimately everything works out, right?  But the disappointment of this standard 'parse' in Memento is profound, if not downright outrageous.  But I like to think the movie succeeds, in perhaps the same manner as a magician's levitation act.  After the magician knocks out the supports, the 'lovely assistant' is still floating.  I like to think that what remains 'floating' in this movie--after the supports have been knocked out--feels just as magical to the viewer as the denouement of the magician's act.  The ultimate moral to this movie has the best set of legs I think I've _ever_ seen; and they're all the more marvelous for the fact that one reads them off the retinal afterimage of the explosion of one's expectations.All this, and the fact that it has to be one of the most simply gorgeous movies I've ever seen.  And the fact that, yeah, one is constantly on the edge of one's seat waiting for the next moment that one's jaw hits the floor.  I don't want to leave you with the impression that the movie doesn't deliver any of the standard 'goods;' it does, in spades.  It's just that the 'dark' anti-heroic aspect is more than made up for in an overarching theme with cosmic implications that are inspiring and directly applicable to your own life; a rare thing in film, wot?",10,0,1,2 January 2002
Passengers," Operatic
","Flicks like this are what I call 'operatic': It's a simple scenario fleshed out with a thinly reticulated plotline. Though I'm not an opera *fan*, I understand the attraction for some and have gotten varied mileage from the medium. The job of opera is to convince you that the core one-note-johnny plot concept is driven by truly powerful emotional, humanistic forces.And I feel that _Passengers_ comes pretty close to succeeding. It's got the finery of opera; astounding set, costume, and props work; great pacing via artful storyboarding and editing; fine acting; some truly great scripting. Newman's score is subdued, yet well-integrated with the action.From time-to-time a ball gets sorta dropped: No spoilers, but some of the depiction of tech work, particularly in the crisis toward the end, seems clumsily done.And, true to opera, we're left with a closing image that invites us to metabolize that simple plot as one vested with deep humanity and even redemption. Will it work for you? Who's to say?Loved Sheen's work, here. So nice to see him stretch a bit to play an AI automaton. A delight to watch!Anyway, with the caveats given above, I think it's safe to recommend the flick.An interesting side-note: The flick nicely dovetails themes of cosmic ennui, an abiding interest in truth as key to sustainable relationship, redemption, and interpersonal fulfillment. Gotta say: With so many flicks these days dropping hints--seemingly being picked up by many--that the eldritch Significant Other relationship as key to happiness concept is overrated, interesting to see a high-tech future sci-fi flick pushing against that androgynous, sexless tide.I mean... Is that a *perfect* 'date flick*, or WOT?(!)",8,0,1,18 March 2018
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," A miraculous movie!
","I normally do not go out for sappy, romantic roller coaster romantic fare; and Forgetting Sarah Marshall (FSM) pretty much falls under the romantic 'date flick' rubric.And I can't, for the life of me, quite figure out why I liked this so much. I guess the filmmakers succeed in making the welter of comic bits, scenes, and images come across like genuine romantic sweet chaos. How they succeeded is beyond my comprehension.And maybe that's the point. Some films are good, some are bad, and some are sort of like miracles. Their power is inexplicable; and that's how FSM felt to me.It was boffo, a bit over-the-top, a tad muddled, a mix of character study, revelation, and farce. And, as things unfolded, by dint of pacing and sheer comic/character acting power, I came to really care about the characters; and I loved it! I glowed through most of FSM.Here's a way of looking at it: FSM was sort of like Shakespearean romantic farce. Maybe that explains why I liked it; because my mind already has a little engine for processing this kind of narrative stuff, built up from past experiences watching Shakespeare In The Park!It also comes down to artistic sincerity. Most romance flicks are a little insulting because they're not sincere. There was something, in the end, believable and therefore redeeming about the characters and their silly little Hawaiian comedy of errors and feints.And that's a miracle, in my book! This is not an ordinary date flick.",Null,68,103,16 January 2009
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Allegory blowback and a few other issues, but still worth watching
","Sorry, but I don't have a totally glowing review of Narnia. Given the response among my pals and me here in Taiwan, I'm sort of curious what is going on in the minds of the folks' who check in to post these 20-thumbs-up reviews.One local response in particular summed it up: One of my buddies said he's getting sort of tired of the relentless barrage of Manichean sensory overload flicks. I can see his point. They may have a cuteness factor to soften them (e.g., cute Hobbits in Ring, or the kids in Narnia), but the big thing now seems to be starkly dualistic fantasy white-hat/black-hat CGI-enhanced action.That said, I understand that the Narnia books were supposed to be a Christ allegory, and can see the attempt to set forth at least the basic ideas that shape and inform the plot development, especially the one involving Aslan and Edmund.Before continuing, I should point out I didn't read the Narnia chronicles, though I have read Mere Christianity, The Screwtape Letters, and The Great Divorce. And I've seen both the BBC and American productions of Shadowlands.It seems that even someone as capable as C.S.Lewis can't recast a sacrifice myth so that it makes sense.It's going to be interesting to see how American fundamentalists (in particular) will respond to this. When the White Witch refers to the universal moral principle to which even Aslan is bound, won't they flinch at this as a usurpation of God's sovereignty; a kind of 'cosmic muffin' pantheism? Then the problem enters in that, if the moral principle is truly universal, it applies here on Earth as it does in Narnia. If we can't (and don't) transfer honorary debts here on Earth, how can Aslan take Edmund's lumps for him, romantic though it may seem in a parallel universe, in living color, and on the big screen? And, to the best of my knowledge, these elements are the crux of the prevailing Christ myth espoused by most folks that call themselves Christian. In general, the net effect of the scenarios with a spiritual payload suggest to me more of a Hindu/Buddhist message e.g., where the illusory treats the White Witch manufactures for Edmund are the Hindu 'maya.' Moving on, a few more observations.Other commenters have kudos for the kids' acting, but I remember the palpable relief I felt when Jim Broadbent hit the screen, and I got to see a little *real* acting for a change. The kids were OK, but really that's all. Well, perhaps except for Edmund's character (see below).I thought Peter's character transition was mismanaged. He starts out as this hapless kid with a dazzling sword thrust into his hands and then suddenly is supposed to be a formidable foe to enraged, strapping, battle-hardened, armor-encrusted, chimerical beasts. Perhaps this is where my unfamiliarity with the original books has me at a loss; it may be that Lewis more carefully crafts this transition, and makes it more believable. Perhaps this was a tricky thing to engineer in the screen writing, so they just hoped the viewer would obligingly bridge the gap. Well, it sort of stuck out for me, so there you have it.Much else in the movie is great. I really liked the way Tumnus the faun was understated; nicely directed and acted. The sets were fantastic, both in Narnia and Earthside. The music was good, though I didn't care for the selection that ran during the opening sequences/credits; that blockbuster-requisite one-style-fits-all guaranteed heartstring-tugger sound felt out of place for the period and situation; no doubt the product of a session between the producers and industry consultants. It sort of started me off with a bad taste in my ear. Too bad! You'd think I wouldn't care for the heavily produced images, but they were so very, very well done that they generally didn't feel 'imposed.' Excepting the allegory blowback issue mentioned above, a lot of the story and character development is great. I love Edmund; he's a great character, and his contrast with the other characters gives a great illustration of venality, and makes that love that accepts him and shepherds him to a better spiritual place all that much more deep and truly loving. His character was well directed and acted, especially in light of the fact that it was so difficult.OK, enough for now. Thanks for reading.",Null,1,2,9 January 2006
That Thing You Do!," A Hoot; comes very, very close to being a great movie
","I didn't see That Thing You Do (TTYD) when it came out, and it's too bad. This movie will--strange to think--rank up there with 'Stop Making Sense' as a classic concert film. Interesting that 1) they're not really comparable, since SMS is real concert footage and TTYD is a mockumentary, and 2) Jonathon Demme is in TTYD!Is this a timeless movie? Close. Darn close. What's great? Actually--almost enlightening--Hanks' writing is really quite wonderful. The dialog is almost a rare example of direct, effective, 'connecting' film writing. The casting, directing, and acting is great. The editing is very effective. The sets, costumes, general 'look' is a delight. The music is very, very effective. So much subtle craftsmanship goes into stuff at the right levels of detail, that you might accuse the film of failing to be like a genuine 'rock 'n' roll experience' because it's almost too crafty. But I think they pull it off.What's wrong with the movie? Not much. The ending flags a little. The pre-credits posting of thumbnail future bios of the characters is a cheap device; but again I think it doesn't eclipse the power of the mythic payload (the moral) which ultimately has to do with the power of love. And I don't say that in a wishy-washy sense. What is love? According to this movie, it's that multi-dimensional experience which includes not just finding 'that special someone,' but also finding your path. It reminds me of an exchange I had with a work buddy who hoped to write 'that big hit tune' and retire early. I loaned him a record by Fred Frith, which put him off entirely. 'This guy won't ever get anywhere,' he said. But I patiently explained that he (my friend) and I get up in the morning and go to our corporate jobs. This guy (Frith) gets up and goes to the studio. Who's the success? That's a big life lesson, and I think this movie nuances that very effectively. It can even translate to any of life's pursuits, not just music.I found myself being continuously delighted by this film. At the risk of sounding like a green ass, I want to plug this film's attention to a time-honored aesthetic virtue: Hard work. This film is a labor of love, with equal attention to the inspiration AND perspiration.I can't believe how much I like this movie! I feel like a bobbysoxer saying it! I resonated with this movie on many points. Let me give you one example. I was in a little band once and was something of the 'muse' of that band. Something I always marveled at was how 'the creative process' people talk about is actually a very simple and practical reality when you're actually being creative. One of the sweet, simple high points of working up a number is the act of picking the tempo. If you've ever done this, you know what I'm talking about. Picking the tempo is a profoundly rewarding act, and of course that's just one small aspect of the process. So the scene near the beginning of the flick where the drummer overrules Jimmy and establishes an uptempo beat to what was supposed to be a ballad is a profoundly resonant moment for me. And the direction and editing bring together an almost perfect picture of the very real and profound joy that this brings to people.There were many, many moments in this movie that affected me in much the same way. If you haven't seen it and you love 'concert films,' check it out.(NOTE: I wrote a little 'trip guide' to TTYD!, which can be found at: http://www.ronazajac.com/That_Thing_You_Do_Comments.pdf .

Dead Poets Society," Very good in spite of some heavy-handedness
","*** Spoilers ***I very much enjoyed the acting and character development in the film. I felt deeply moved for the first half/two-thirds of the movie. I sort of lost it toward the end, as I felt the handling of the suicide was sort of botched, giving it a kind of 'cathartic straw-dog' feel--it wasn't really integrated properly. And, oddly, it's hard for me to put my finger on the reason I was struck that way. Perhaps it had to do with feeling that the development of Neil's father was too much of a caricature of the stifling heartless b***ard dad. Also, it just seemed too easy; almost formulaic. The symbol of Neil's Puck crown doubling as a crown of thorns was overdone. They didn't trust the viewers' capacity to pick up on it without a big ritualization scene. It was a setup for a big fall, and you could see the machinations too easily.But; equal time for good symbol management!: The final standing-on-desk scene is lovely. I'm glad they closed the movie with a very compelling representation of a kind of 'election' to living fully.*** End of Spoilers ***A great vehicle for all parties, some very good writing, very good cinematography, some lovely substories (e.g., Overstreet's wooing of his sweetheart away from her jock boyfriend), and a lot of heart. I would recommend this movie.",Null,0,1,21 September 2002
L.A. Confidential," Well-nigh Perfect
","L.A. Confidential is straight-up storytelling, well done.It's hard to know where to step in to comment on the flick; there are so many possible ports of entry. Perhaps the best place to start has to do with its vast portrait of corrupt officialdom. So, if you're the kind of person who gets drawn in to crime stories with broad swathes of moral grey, hesitate not: Watch it now.The flick is rewarding simply from its richness. It has so many layers and treatments and telling scenes and exchanges. So if I start expounding on a symbol or metaphor, it's a fart in a flaw.But I want to try, anyway.Here's a little something that I can recommend by way of a recurring symbol that might help anchor you as you start taking in the firehose of imagery:The flick really centers around Ed Exley's character, played by Pierce. He's the guy who's dancing on the fault line between two aspects of law enforcement practicum; a stoic, fact-basis and a romantic, belief-basis. And the writing fixes on a very clever image that you can see as a key to this dance: Exley's eyeglasses. They dance on and off his face, and you can dependably see this as a symbol of his understanding of law enforcement practice; which starts out vacillating, but eventually settles on a clear vision of true law enforcement in a decent republic. This vision ascends, takes hold, and ushers him into the vortex of the film's crisis confrontation.This is the heart of a story in which the images informing your understanding of that heart is as deep as it is broad. That's how great this flick is.Check it out.",10,1,2,24 April 2018
Yes Man," Tries to transcend being yet-another Carrey vehicle flick; doesn't quite pull it off
","I actually kind of liked Yes Man. For much of the time, I thought I was watching a movie where the plot and the writing for various characters took precedence over the goal of feeding another body to the Carrey-loving piranhas.It was interesting: It appears that when the plot stopped moving forward, Carrey started becoming his usual buffoon; a kind of cinematic version of nature abhors a vacuum. When the plot again got (sort of) roused from its slumber, the direction of Carrey fell back into the territory where his antics get subsumed under the larger (and surely nobler) goal of delivering an actual story to the viewer.Carrey is capable of doing fine acting. I want to see a flick where, from start to finish, that's what he does. And, of course, with his clout and cache, he can afford to pick and choose a script and role (and director) that will allow him to do this.When you discount Carrey's buffoonery, what's left? Unfortunately, a mixed bag. The overall theme is great: Positivity nets you good fortune. I loved that message! The bit of business at the end of the movie--with the love interest, and revisiting the seminar to reconfront the guru--was sort of cool, but seemed to me not to have been written and directed well.In general I would characterize this as a movie that still relies too much on Carrey's draw, and so thinks it can afford to skimp on the aesthetics.

The Hateful Eight," Vital
","The key (for me) to The Hateful Eight is that it is fine, fine theater.And that means that it flows like a vital river--as does all good theater.It's like a natural phenomenon. But, of course, it's also somehow special, and in that way for which Tarantino is known: Create a scenario in which quiet deceptions and general moral ossifications are flung at high velocities against the wall, examine the data from the scattering, and draw your own moral conclusions.These are ordinary theatrics. The amazing thing is how Tarantino makes them compellingly ponderable, in real time, on the big screen. Yet again.I 'fault' my rating by one star, but only because this doesn't exceed a very, very high-water mark set by Pulp Fiction.Check it out.",9,1,4,13 November 2018
We Were Soldiers," yet another makeover of the corpse of US/Vietnam
","Hmm.  Hard to know where to start.First of all, it needs to be said that it is absolutely impossible to 'spoil' this movie; that is, give away something crucial in the plot or character development that a new viewer would want to be a surprise.  Do people agree with me that this movie can't be 'spoiled'?There's a chance this movie might/could be construed as a verite revelation of the depths of self-deception, abuse-of-power, and might-driven neocolonialism into which the US had sunk by that time.  I mean, think about it:  Imagine Mel and the gang really believing that the 'wheels' would never, ever, ever abuse the sacred trust of the military contract--the contract in which they agree to exchange their lives for the defense of their country--by sending deadly power where it has absolutely no business being.That might have made for a good, even redemptive, motivating idea behind this movie.  Unfortunately, I can't grant this redemptive interpretation.I suspect the movie is trying to say something grand; dare I say 'new'; about heroism, and its highest expression.  To address this, I'm going to compare the climactic 'heroic' moment from this movie to the climactic 'heroic' moment from the first 'Jurassic Park' movie.  Sad to say; they're comparable.Remember the Jurassic Park theme music?  John Williams wrote sundry variations on that theme for use in mood-setting in the movie.  At the end, when Our Heroes are about to get pounced upon by a raptor, the rex snatches the raptor in mid-pounce and shakes it about in apparent reptilian thrill-of-the-chase glee.  Listen to what happens in the sound track: That's the moment when they deploy the 'heroic' orchestration of the Jurassic Park theme by Williams.  But:  Why are they playing a heroic theme? The rex isn't a hero!  She isn't 'Lassie'!  She didn't 'save' our protagonists; she was hungry!  There's a nasty and insulting dissonance between the music and the depicted event that deprives the movie of any redeeming value it might have retained up to that point.  It's insulting because it blythely assumes you're not going to notice.The same thing happened at the 'big' moment at the end of We Were Soldiers. It's the scene where Mel and the (surviving) gang walk over a ridge, into a line of VC.  At that moment, when it appears a VC gunner is about to plug Mel (oh my God!  Not *MEL*!), the day is saved by air support, and we're treated to an enchanting 5+ minute slo-mo hi-tech blood fest where massive air support absolutely riddles the VC lines with a cats-and-dogs hail of hot lead.  Bring up the 'triumphal', 'heroic' theme, the one that informs us that we can all relax in the sure knowledge that Mel will get his millions. The VC blood is flowing like champagne at a debutante ball.  It's party time!  But where's the heroism in this?  It's not heroic!  It's just as dissonant in this regard as the scene at the end of Jurassic Park!  When one bank robber blows away a cop about to nab his accomplice, he's not a hero.I'll tell you who the heros are.The real heros in this story are the people who spent vast resources over the last 25 years to save us from having to face the moral debacle of Vietnam.  They've spent billions of dollars and countless light-years of celluloid to remind us that a technologically advanced people who traveled thousands of miles to a primitive agrarian culture to maim and kill those who resisted our socioeconomic intrusions are, at heart, a well-meaning bunch of folks, really just wanting to bring the light of democracy and freedom to rice farmers.I've thought about the Vietnam movies.  Doesn't it seem like each one hopes to drive the last nail into the coffin of that legacy?  Do we need yet another nail?  Isn't this hapless coffin bristling with nails, looking by now like a porcupine?  Wouldn't that tell you something?  What it tells me is that these movies aren't nails.  They're countless cinematic makeup specialists trying to give the corpse the final 'makeover' that will finally convince us of the lie we want so bad to believe, but never will, because there's a place deep down inside each of us that knows it will die once and for all if we believe a lie that big and that ugly.  And I'm talking about the lie that says our intentions in Vietnam were good, and we were there defending freedom and democracy.This movie is yet another corpse makeover masquerading as a nail in the coffin.  Reject it.  Get informed.  If you give a rat's a*s, read up on Vietnam, weep over our hubris, apologize to those wounded by that legacy, vow to do what you can to return our military heritage to that envisioned by the founders:  The defense of our territory from intrusion from outsiders; not a tool in the hands of global economic power junkies.  Scrape the countless layers of makeup off the corpse, grieve over it, bury it, and move on.",1,0,5,22 August 2002
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Obligatory paean
","I'm not writing to say something about Strangelove as much as to chime in with my praise for the values, artistic and human, to which it stands as a monument.Of course, that's a weird thing to say about a script that seems to walk a tightwire, using a balance pole with a gorilla sitting on one end and the archangel Gabriel sitting on the other, ten miles high with absolutely no safety net below.An unknown mystery factor:  Along with the TV Rocky & Bullwinkle show, this movie just may have saved the world from nuclear annihilation.  But perhaps we'll never know, at least not until thoroughgoing research has been done in the Akashic Records.A personal story.  I first saw this movie when I was about 6.  I was too young and innocent to understand any of the dialog or action; I certainly did not pick up on the plot.  But a minor miracle happened there in that dark theatre.  Col. 'Bat' Guano, preparing to shoot the Coke(tm) machine, tells Mandrake that if they don't reach the President, he'll have to answer to the Coca Cola(tm) company.  People in the audience laughed.  I leaned over to my Dad and said, 'Dad, what's funny?'  He leaned over, said a mere handful of explanatory words, I got the joke and laughed.  I can't tell you what my Dad said, I don't remember.  I can only assure you that it worked for me, and I truly *did* get the joke.  That moment is forever locked in my memory.Thanks, Stan, Terry, Peter George, all parties.P.S.: Oh yeah.  I have seen the movie a couple of times since I was 6. B^)",10,1,1,28 April 2003
Underworld Awakening," Why do *so* many aging fluorescent bulbs go unreplaced in the future?
","Sorry, I just don't buy it: I sincerely think the emperor lacks clothes, here.Everyone talks about the back story and the mom/daughter bonding and the conflict and all that, but why do I get the impression that at heart all this was a dim premise to generate a bunch of CGI heat? I know I'm fully capable of resonating with a compelling myth; don't tell me I just 'don't get it'.I really don't belong here: Movies like this are almost another species of public entertainment. I love love love lo-tech flicks that pry my heart open and remind me of what truth, beauty, and heroism really are.This is a great movie if non-stop violent action with little-to-no motivational narrative support floats your boat. I mean that: I have enough imagination to realize that there is a significant demographic that digs this, and more power to them and the sector of the film system that caters to them. But if you like a great story and you like to be truly touched by something beautiful in a movie, don't be surprised if this flick leaves you cold.Well, this film does leave us with one powerful existential question: Why, in the future, are public spaces lit solely by fluorescent bulbs that flicker on and off incessantly? Will epilepsy have been completely eradicated by then? Are the janitors frequently on strike?",4,7,14,25 January 2012
Capote," Ahhhh! A good and proper role for Mr. Hoffman!
","There's a great deal to recommend this movie, well beyond my Summary Line ('Ahhhh!...'). But I just want to take out a second to say: I *knew* it, I *knew* it, I *knew* it! I always knew that Hoffman would be up to the challenge of a demanding role like this. Just give this man the right script and a role with depth, and Hoffman will deliver the goods. I've seen him in half-rate stuff--Owning Mahowney (one-note johnny storyline), 25th Hour (desultory development), Love Liza (poorly written/directed)--and it's a waste of his abilities. With roles in solid movies like 'Ripley,' and now 'Capote,' he absolutely shimmers.*All* the casting in his movie is perfect, and it's perfectly written, directed, shot, edited. It's a great and compelling story. See this movie.",Null,0,1,4 March 2006
American Sniper," Well, there it is.
","Gotta say, as much as I, a bleeding-heart liberal in-good-standing, have political remonstrances about this flick, I've gotta give it beaucoup kudos as an artistic product. Eastwood set a tight focus for it, and he achieved an end-product that reflects that focus. And he deserves respect for that.And, when I say 'tight focus', I don't mean a one-note johnny. The hero is the tip of an iceberg: Maybe he really had the goods to do four tours of duty in Iraq and not be scarred. It's odd/coincidental; I just-so-happened to read a Wikipedia page about PSTD before viewing, and discovered that it can produce actual, physical brain changes. And I think _Sniper_ understands this, and addresses it in an artfully understated way. The hero isn't brusque with his post-operations psychiatrist, he isn't flippant or coy; he's just being who he is. And the shrink, one trusts, makes the right decision and invites him to join him in his particular ministry; attending to the needs of the rest of that iceberg that one doesn't normally see; those who meant as well as our 'hero' did, but wound up, through tough luck or unexpected weakness, marred and scarred.And, make no mistake, I still consider the 2003 invasion of Iraq a cowardly act, and a war crime. I consider people like the hero of this movie to have been abused by a system that continues to think America has some kind of divine right to be cowardly, yet thought of as brave; to be disastrously precipitous, yet thought of as agents of positive change; to be meddlesome, yet thought of as (small-'r') republican; to be profligate, yet thought of as 'conservative'. The hero's noble impulses to be a 'sheepdog' were ill-used by the nation's power-jackals.To me, the question of this movie is not whether he went through hell and kept his humanity. The question is whether his being oblivious to the cynicism of elites who harnessed his good will to the service of criminal ends, in principle, robs him of his humanity, in _our_ eyes.Anyway, I hope this gives you something you can take away: In spite of the preponderance of imagery supportive of the heroics of the 'successful' military man, the sharp lines and contours of that image--stating its case fairly unequivocally--serve as a Rorschach against which one can test one's own basic response to the ideal of noble (deadly) service to the state.",9,10,28,19 January 2015
Fargo," Dantesque vision
","Shortly after seeing this movie (somewhat belatedly), I heard a local talk show host interview a couple who had just turned out a new translation of Dante's Inferno.One feature of the Inferno that was touched on in the interview was the notion that the fraudulent reside at a lower level of Hell than even the murderous.  Then, it hit me.  That's what Fargo is all about.  Like a glowing nuclear core in the bowels of an aircraft carrier, the grandfather, in all his fraudulent glory, is the psychic de facto ringleader of all the malfeasance that takes place in the movie.  At the heart of the banal evil of our minor thugs and would-be high rollers (and, for that matter, 'normal' people placidly assuming their roles in a 'normal' world) is a local leading man of business, a taciturn pillar of the community.Fargo is a picture of Hell, in the tradition of Dante, a tour de force on the part of the Coens to set this as they did, and one of the best movies ever made.",Null,0,0,13 January 2003
Burn After Reading," Even a 'bad' Coen Brothers movie...
","...is better than other 'good' movies.Yeah, I'll admit that 'Burn' is a little weak; not operatic, like 'No Country,' which at least was based on a piece of well-turned literature.I watched 'Burn,' and felt that I'd been sort of burned. But over time it starts to grow on you.There's a common thread to the Coen's films: They're all about the primacy of the human spirit. Sure, they tend to take up themes in which this truth is showcased in negative situations, but spirit continues to be the focus; the Coens see to that.And that's the simple message in 'Burn.' There's one particularly salutary side effect of this emphasis in a spooked-themed movie. The anti-'Burn' movie could be, for instance, 'Enemy of the State.' I mentioned this in another of my comments. 'Enemy' commits the sin of hewing to the convention that what we really want is to be reminded that 'they'--you, know, 'them'--are out get 'us.' And 'Enemy' goes to insanely high-production, high-dollar ends to drive that theme a mile into the ground.The Coens will never do this. They will never, ever let us off the hook; that sharp little hook that is the eternal truth that we are responsible for what we choose to see, and are therefore responsible for who we allow ourselves to become. And for that, I'm thankful. And that is a redeeming aspect of 'Burn.' It's another notch on the handle of the crossbow the Coens use to shoot down the most sacred of the human race's sacred cows: That we can--nay, must!--point to someone else and blame them for our oppression.So, I guess my net impression is that, 'Burn' is a sort of yawpy romp, but in the Coen tradition; which means that this yawpy romp is better than other more 'serious' films which nonetheless commit the error of encouraging us in our blindness.",8,0,2,8 January 2009
Watchmen," Worth watching for you?
","NOTE: This is a cut/paste (and slight touch-up) of one of my message board comments. It pretty much addresses my take on a prevalent, hot issue re 'Watchmen'; it it worth watching?Here's my experience: Snyder opens up with the murder of the Comedian. I want to know why; he seems like a strange, rich, complex person. A bit tragic, perhaps? Who is this guy in his penthouse app't, reading Hustler and channel surfing? And why a crack assassin? Oh! Look! A bit heavy-handed, perhaps, and no doubt impaired by encroaching post-middle-age, but he does pack a wallop! And why does the assassin at least afford the Comedian some semblance of a fair fight?; he could have just plugged him in the brain and pocketed the fee. Is it because it's a movie, and people expect action, or is there something else? And then the credits montage rolls; beautiful, colorful, with taunting images that set up the parallel universe in which Silhouette gets the nurse, we get a good look at the dude on the Grassy Knoll (do I know him?(!)), the phalanx of National Guardsmen shoot the DFH's point-blank, and some blue dude is shaking hands with Kennedy.At this point, I'm on the edge of my seat; and I don't mean that literally: The film has given me all the cues I need to get locked in and poised to take in the story from a particular mindset. I'm going to be scouring the screen, looking for visual clues, contextualizing the flashback vignettes, carefully processing the spoken lines to try to understand what makes the characters tick. I know that sounds like a normal response to normal storytelling, but for me I'm talking about one especially engaging kind of movie storytelling.And this is what this kind of movie does to me. Memento (Christopher Nolan flick with Guy Pierce) did this to me, for pretty much the same reasons; on-screen characters are doing things out of the ordinary, for reasons that may be opaque at first, but the film work quickly leads me to believe that if I do my part, if I pay attention and dig hard enough, I'll break the code and understand. And, if I'm really lucky, the flick will not have lead me astray. It pays off in silver dollars.Watchmen does all this for me.",10,10,18,15 August 2009
The Bourne Identity," a surprisingly lousy movie
","WARNING!  This movie contains *no spoilers*; I don't think it wants to let you know what it's about!I was very disappointed in The Bourne Identity; though maybe I shouldn't have been.  Perhaps it's only a matter of time before someone will enlist top acting talent and the best equipment and action directing for a flop.Was it just me, or did the emperor have no clothes?  Was this movie like certain rock concerts, where you have to have already heard the CDs in order to have any idea what they're doing onstage?  Having not read the book, I didn't see what was going on beside the obvious, though I did get a vague impression there was some kind of ingenious fillip at the end involving the main character's amnesia perhaps being an integral part of his programmed agent role.Lacking that bit, or even not, this movie is sort of like opera; a thread of a plot, supposedly raised to the level of high art by dint of its glorious trappings.  The only problem here is that, whereas opera has going for it a genuine kernel of human drama and passion, all this movie has is yet-another tweak to the rather worn and cheap spook/paranoid fantasy 'thriller' theme. This theme screams alienation so loud that the love interest is inaudible (read:  gratuitous).  These fantasies perhaps only really serve to remind us in that coy, clever, underhanded, and (these days) maddingly prevailing way that democracy really *is* dead in this country.  So just GIVE UP.  Why do we shell out sheckles for this?  Why do we pay to be told what we *really* think?Interesting side note.  Walking out of the dark theatre into the hallway, a theatre worker was handing out *free* suckers to the exiting patrons.  I declined.  But I had a couple of afterthoughts.  One was that I should have taken the sucker so I'd have gotten *something* for my $7.50.  The other was a strange wondering if there was a subconscious message being delivered; they were acknowledging we were suckers for going to that movie.

Baby Driver," Amazing action, starts with promise, loses narrative focus
","My title sez all. It start out with amazing character/action panache. Sets things up very, very well, then squanders them.Not much more to say. Fantastic production values. Stunning chase sequences. Generally well acted and (I guess) directed. Was this flick a victim of producers' cold feet?",5,1,3,16 January 2018
21," Interesting story; a little shallow emotionally
","Nice try--and I always want to cut no less stellar a personage as Spacey some slack--but in the end it didn't quite resonate.I think I have a bone to pick with movies that resort to plot devices like 1) the sting 2) guy-gets-girl (absent a genuinely warm human interest), 3) a litany of reversals, and 5) a 'rising from the ashes' wrap-it-up-put-a-bow-on-it feelgood ending, without a proper denouement.Reflecting on this gives me new respect for the core narrative power of opera. Opera is, come to think of it, irrational, in that typically no effort is made to vest one narrative element with special resonance by virtue of its contrast against other elements. The goal in Opera is to simply present a fairly unitary image, and tease the romantic power out of that image. The idea is that love, courage--even unmitigated malfeasance--properly presented, will deliver the goods, if all the buttons are pushed that properly present that image in a way that can't be made light of or otherwise ignored.'21' doesn't really have that unitary image; something truly heroic, notwithstanding that fairly artful final scene.In the end, the film feels gimmicky. Too many moving parts, some of them just don't quite fit, and those weaknesses could have been avoided by stripping them out and having a core image that resonates; which, despite efforts to make the central theme do so, didn't.Sorry! Can't recommend this one....I do want to add one thing: I feel that Spacey is a kind of Mingus of American movies; he has this abiding desire to assemble a crop of young talent and make then deliver. That's respectable. But sometimes the actual effect is like that when Mingus was working with a passel of raw talent: A lot of rawness. And, of course, the preceding observations re weakness in conception/design apply.",Null,2,3,12 July 2008
Apocalypse Now," Interesting Redux
","Believe it or not, I have only just seen the redux.What's interesting is what the redux adds:  For one thing, it better highlights the idea that if Kurtz didn't have a method, he did have (or had had) a goal:  'Winning' in Vietnam.  And this dovetails with another image from the original, nicely paired with a new image in the redux.  Image one, from the Playmate USO show:  While the Americans had myriad choices, the Vietnam had a choice between victory or death.  Image two, from the French plantation, reminding us that the French had actually built something there in Vietnam.  What did the Americans have?  The Dominoe Theory.  In other words, we didn't have s**t, and the redux drives this home a little better.I love this movie because it's still a bit of a Rorschach.  It's a mystery wrapped in an enigma, or some f**kin' thing.  To wit:  Are we ever given a satisfactory picture of the meaning behind Kurtz?  The redux seems a little better at conveying the feel of approaching an event horizon, where morality and reality becomes more chaotic and splintered, and it would not be meet and right to expect to be able to walk away 'resolved.'  The movie resolves by resolutely evading a clear resolution.  But there are mirror shards whipping by our heads at 400mph, bearing fleeting perspectives.  Maybe Kurtz *is* 'America in Vietnam.'  Maybe we won't understand the meaning of the Vietnam War until we understand that the best picture we'll ever get of that is Kurtz.  Which is to say that we simply engineered, to the tune of $400B (which, I heard, only *just* got paid off), a horror show to fulfill our Daily Minimum Requirement for The Horror.All that said, there were still a few bits that maybe should have been left out.  The scene with the Bunnies meeting and greeting the crew was unnecessary.  Specifically, Willard engineers the deal--2 tins of diesel for a couple hours with the bunnies--and this is distinctly out of character for the spartan Willard.  The scenes at the French Plantation were a mix 'n' match; Clean's burial; good.  Explanation of prior French integration into Viet society; good.  Opium and sex; again, glaringly out of character for Willard.  Any time Willard cracks a smile or otherwise distracts from his own proto-Kurtz philosophy has to remain suspect.This was a great movie and remains a great movie.  See it.",Null,2,3,12 September 2003
Divergent," Sci-fi breakthru wannabe
","'Divergent' strains to be the next Blade Runner or Matrix. You can see where they tried to throw in all the de rigueur elements: There's a social status quo that people accept and within which they operate. This is a little like the Matrix, except that there's (spoiler) the sense, by the story's end, that the social system in Divergent fails not because it's a systemic horror-show illusion (a la Matrix), but because the checks and balances fail; so Divergent doesn't *really* go for broke in that sense.There's a VO backstory involving a war and the city of Chicago being surrounded by an odd sort of 'wall'. This comes off like a quaint throwback to Blade Runner, with it's backdrop social reality of off- planet white flight. The difference is that Blade Runner's social backdrop feels strangely warm and contiguous with our reality, whereas Divergent's feels contrived for the express purpose of explaining how the 'new' Chicago's progenitors got pushed to contrive the faction system. Frankly, I prefer a backdrop that looks like a version of 'home'; and that shouldn't just be another contrivance to 'explain' things.I think the flick was supposed to be an extended parable on the importance of mutation for survival. But, in the end, I wasn't convinced that it sheds light on this; it veered too far into future dystopia action hero fantasy shoot-'em-up territory. We're supposed to understand that the heroine transcends her faction. In the end, it just sorta looks like she simply lucks into the position of getting the big picture and then using her faction-developed skills to blast through and stop the malefactors.There's a lot of stuff in the flick that doesn't seem to gel. There's an interpersonal antagonism within the heroine's caste that seems more designed to generate dramatic tension than it does to demonstrate caste- functional social behaviors; in other words, from time to time, writing for character just doesn't compute. In the end (spoiler) there's a deus ex machina moment where we're to believe a drug-programmed person is induced to snap out of it at the point where the heroine just-so-happens to need his aid to extricate her from yet-another brush with death, so she can go on to save the day.What's good about the flick? The actors were marvelously professional, and took direction exceedingly well. Set work, effects, stunts, shots, editing, and scene-by-scene dramatic flow was managed well, in a general sense. Production work was fully what one would expect from a contemporary sci-fi action flick. Hollywood has honed that stuff down to a razor sharpness which is always a marvel to behold; and might even see you through the viewing with nary a thought to leaving the theater or ejecting the medium from your video box.But if you're hoping to see the next mindblower sci-fi wunderkind, abandon hope.",6,0,1,19 August 2014
Being John Malkovich," cheap premise taken to dizzying heights
","*** Spoilers Ahead ***I think there's a lot of latitude in how one can 'take' this movie.  I have a friend who felt ripped off by the lesbian plot angle.  I pointed out to him that the angle in which Cusack's character gets to use Malkovich's prestige to push puppetry up to and over the edge was sheer brilliance; and he had to admit that that did rather salvage the central theme from a purely puerile development.  Then he pointed out the gulf between the otherworldly 'wackiness' of the first half of the movie and the later abandonment of that particular brand of surreality for the relatively 'serious' feel of the last half.  That was an inconsistency in the film that I guess I have to cop to.At any rate, I still thought it was worth watching; a very exciting, fun, well-written, well-acted, entertaining movie, and not a little thought-provoking.  The most amazing thing about the movie is that it takes a old worn out theme (metempsychosis; transmigration of souls) and breaths real new life into it.Check it out.",Null,0,1,6 January 2003
The Men Who Stare at Goats," Prophetic. And I'm NOT kidding.
","A lot of commentary on this film appears to range between 'pointless' and 'fun'.I thought 'Goats' was prophetic. I think the real initial split is between the folks who recognized certain key messages and the folks for whom the film was a sort of character-based light show. If you're among the latter group, then I understand how the film could disappoint. Without that overarching message--a genuine struggle between the forces of light and darkness--'Goats' may be good for a postmodern chuckle or two, but fairly empty on the whole.The fact is that the story that Jon Ronson hit on has very, very far-reaching implications: And those implications are spiritual in nature.Perhaps the strongest overall message relates to how the New Earth Army vision affords us perhaps the perfect witness: A clear and clean counterexample to what came out of the Bush/neocon/PNAC (Project for a New American Century) 'vision' for the future of American global power projection. Jon, in essence, seems to be saying, if you want to understand what happened with Bush II power projection, this can genuinely be best understood in the context of the New Earth Army phenomenon from 50-odd years ago.And I think that's a powerful message.Watch the movie with that key contrast in mind--seriously trying to grapple with the full implications of this turnabout in national spiritual choices--and I guarantee you'll strike gold.Really. Do yourself a favor and watch and listen carefully, sifting out these profoundly contrasting worldviews. You might even find yourself crying at certain points in the storyline.",8,2,3,7 April 2010
Ratatouille," It's perfect!
","Ratatouille is an exceptional product, from production to mythic payload. The voice acting is fantastic, and the animation work is painstaking and engaging to view.But let's talk about the myth. Ratatouille is a fun depiction of genius. Sure, it's more than a little cartoonish, but that's more than forgivable: True genius doesn't take itself too seriously either.It's simply a well-wrought story with great character studies. The characters alone are an embarrassment of riches.One of the astounding things about the story of Ratatouille is that it cleverly avoids one of the all-too-common, cop-out, standard-issue karmic machinations: (Here comes the modest spoiler) Most narrative products of this sort feel they have to find a way to dump on the 'heavy' ('bad' guy), and this can even sometimes feel gratuitous.Ratatouille not only refrains from this easy out, it goes one further and fully redeems the heavy. It shows, in a believable way, that 'he wasn't bad, just misunderstood'; and had been so, for a long, long time. His exposure to true genius fulfills a deep and genuine need-- and this sets him right again. This was unexpected and enormously refreshing to see in a 'pop' narrative product. This highlights a light-on-his-feet/turn-on-a-dime openness on the part of Brad Bird as narrator/director.Check it out!",10,0,1,18 June 2016

But the movie still sucks.I'm very picky this way; if I'm going to sit for 1.5 hours and watch something, it has to do better than to amble from one comic bit to another.

The Usual Suspects," Fine for the genre
","I guess my one-line summary is 'damning with faint praise,' as the saying goes....  But I really do want to praise this movie.  It's one of the best films I'm seen in a while; smartly written, beautifully directed and shot. The acting is great.  I have to say that, while not as stunning as, say, the ending to The 39 Steps, the surprise ending to Suspects is cool enough.I am a little surprised at how high Suspects is on the IMDb top 250.  But, in defense of those who would gladly see it ensconced there, I will add that 'heroic crook'-type movies tend to put me off.  It's very hard to humanize a crook in the movies as far as I'm concerned.  I see that Suspects holds these guys at a sort of arms length by highlighting an ultimate dog-eat-dog lack of honor among thieves, at the highest level.  So that salvages it a bit for me.  But, for example, Suspects doesn't come near the humanization of criminality that The Godfather does.  I saw that the movie Heat tried to cop some of that same prestige (by showing the crooks having happy family dinners, etc.), but for me failed achieve an integration.  I'm telling you; you'll always have a hard time convincing me to let criminal elements on screen into the tabernacle of my heart!  Godfather does this, and a look at how it succeeds could be instructive.  Suspects only succeeds to the extent that it doesn't make a pretense of getting you under the skins of the malefactors in that typical time-honored cinematic manner.I would recommend this movie as cinematic art.  I cannot recommend it as a movie that succeeds on a visceral level.  Which means I can only recommend it in a narrow sense.  Sorry.",Null,0,1,21 January 2003
No Country for Old Men," I've taken months to digest NCfOM for this comment
","It's good that I've deferred jotting a note here for a while; I've got it down to a few pat words.No Country for Old Men is a commentary on the American-style myth of the Rugged Individualist.I was about to say it was 'overdue'; like, they maybe could/should have explored this myth during, say, the Reagan era.But I think the extreme way they explore it matches the status of that myth in present-day American society; so it's pitch perfect. It's an attempt to pull us from a specific brink. This is truly a prophetic movie.And, by the way, the Oscar folks know all this. Some reading this comment may be curious how/why a film like 'No Country' could have won so many awards; what's with that?The answer, I think, relates to my comment. If what I say is true, then think of how rare and precious that is.",10,1,3,21 April 2008
Non-Stop," Honest about what it is
","Non-Stop set its sights on being a mid-air heavy action whodunit and sets forth to stealthily achieve that goal. Sometimes its possible to smell 'producer cold feet' syndrome, where stock action-flick action gets hyperbolic toward the end--and you can tell that the producers are panicking and pulling rank over the director. Non-Stop doesn't suffer from this: It's designed, from the ground up, to be a steady IV drip of incrementally escalating dramatic tension, built around a simple, operatic concept: Someone, for some reason, wants to endanger everyone on a transatlantic flight.Like I said, it's operatic and simple, albeit with flurries of complication arising largely from the mystery: What are the motives and means involved?The usual barrier is encountered: The viewer disbelief over the unlikelihood of the byzantinely complex scenario can be suspended IFF the mythos is compelling enough.Is it? Mmmmmm...maybe. Oddly, the ultimate revelation of the motive is a key point in the flick, and it'd be spoiling to reveal it, here. Not giving anything away, it's a guy at the frazzled end of his psychological rope, seeking to make a large social point.Another aspect of the mythos is time-honored (read: OLD): It's what Paddy Chayefsky characterized in Network (1975) as the 'crusty-but- benign' public servant character.I give this flick as high a score as I do because it's honest about its intentions and amazingly fleshes in those intentions with very good production values and pacing. Non-Stop is not normally my cup o' tea, but I found it nonetheless compelling, in a parameterized sort of way.The tension follows the eldritch narrative trajectory; exponentially rising tension to a vertiginous height, a brief chain of intense crisis moments, release, a coda of calmness and connection.From time to time, I chime in on IMDb User Comments to tell readers to avoid certain movies, and I try (and don't always succeed) in telling folks why. The usual reason to avoid a flick is artlessness. Strange to say for a made-to-spec action flick, but Non-Stop is amazingly artful. I would definitely recommend it to budding screenwriters.",8,0,0,3 April 2016
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," High concept, well-produced.
","Great flick! It rides along on a sterling concept, well-articulated, fleshed out with great acting and direction, wrapped in fine production values.It's the kind of flick that you sort of expect to be a piece of trash, but as you watch it, are pleasantly surprised to find it to not be so. You can sit through it and thoroughly enjoy the scenarios, one-liners, and twists. In a way, it's a good example of a balance of concept/writing and production: With some flicks, the writing is so good that you can forgive lousy production. Not so, here: The premise and scenarios were good, but it was still necessary to feel that 'labor of love' in the production; and you got it.Anyway, don't be afraid to rent it and have at it, of an evening.",8,2,2,26 October 2014
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Drama
","Subject line sez all.But... I have to write more, so I will. Odd to think, but this flick comes closest to Jackie Brown in tone and purpose. The difference is that QT adapted Jackie Brown from a novel, and he wrote Once Upon a Time pretty much from the ground, up.But it's pretty much a bestiary of types. I felt that QT hits the ground running with that utterly fantastic confab in the bar between DiCaprio's character and Pacino's character. It sets the tone for the whole movie: Who is Dalton, who is Booth, and what do they mean to us, today? Whether that question rings true as a relevant question hinges on whether Once Upon a Time is true drama or not.I say; it's a relevant question, and Once Upon a Time is true drama.Dig it.",10,18,33,13 August 2019
Django Unchained," Spot-on characterization of internalization of corrupt values
","Yet again, Tarantino shows us a panoramic vista of moral description.Of course, he also plies his usual wares: Fine direction and acting, engaging writing, great shots and sequencing. And another revenge plot with lots and lots of blood.Part of what makes Tarantino so special is the way his scripts are heavy on content; every line is a brightly colored thread in a florid brocade... and normally that's not a good thing--people usually appreciate a lighter touch. And Tarantino does not appear to be getting in the habit of handing those out.I'm suddenly remembering reading Thomas Kuhn's 'The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'. I was amazed to see a book which met two mutually impossible criteria: Never had I seen writing so dense, and yet at the same time with no fat; every line was necessary.And this is how it is with a Tarantino script; dense, with every line, every character, every scene part of a disquisition on established mores, and the struggle to change the world in a way that confronts those mores, head-on.This is not to say that Tarantino's approach has been consistent, especially in regard to this perennial approach to moral questions. These last two flicks play heavier than ever on a kind of (arguably forgivable) puerile fantasy; after all, everyone hates Nazis and Slavers. And they provide convenient piles, driven a mile into the ground, that anchor his flicks and hold them upright. Earlier productions, like Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, achieved great heights of moral probity without recourse to such things. This is why I give RD and PF '10' ratings, but Basterds and Unchained a 'lowly' 9.But, all this cogitating aside, I have to add that I was sometimes moved very deeply by Unchained. Add in the surprise of a charming, light-hearted buddies-on-the-road sequence using a Jim Croce tune as background music, and I've gotta say the thing was very well worth watching.",9,1,4,13 January 2013
The Theory of Everything," Accessible Drama Woven around Key Facts
","The Theory of Everything is an enjoyable flick that simply ticks off key occurrences in Hawkings's life, embedding them in decently paced and storyboarded exposition.And I know that sounds like damning with faint praise. As I watched 'Everything', I simply couldn't stop wondering whether it would measure up to the Errol Morris work, 'A Brief History of Time'.I think, in the end, that Morris's work sort of obviates this new treatment, which felt like a recasting of 'Brief' as straight-up film storytelling.Wow. I realize that I need to cut to the chase, here: I'm torn because 'Everything' is obviously a labor of love, and a paean to a contemporary secular saint. Ergo, I would be a stick-in-the-mud not to respect and enjoy it. But this doesn't change the fact that the treatment just rubbed me the wrong way. Something about the whole idea of minting a standard, groomed/greenlit feature film about Hawking bugs me.But it's a nice flick, as I said quite enjoyable, and my stylistic remonstrance only knocked my rating down a couple of notches.",8,3,5,30 November 2014
2012," A perfect movie that shows what's screwed up about Hollywood
","2012 is almost a textbook case of what's wrong with Hollywood.Why?Because it very, very neatly showcases a particular perversion of the Hollywood system: What you have in 2012 is a story with a lovely, grand overarching theme--which I'll explain below. But the important idea here in my review is that you could very likely miss this theme because it's been slathered over with a thick, nearly opaque faux-buttery coating of pop-thematics and staid disaster movie over-production.If the producers could have found it in their hearts to give the treatment over to a winning director whose sensibility (and aesthetic wiles) they could trust, some balance could have been struck and 2012 could have been a fine film.So, what *is* that excellent-but-buried theme? I tell people that when you pry off the crap, you have a story about 'ways of knowing'. And, in keeping with grand storytelling tradition, these ways of knowing are discrete, can be counted, and are THREE in number. Which, actually, is kinda cool.But all that is moot, given the decisions that the producers _did_ make; sorry to say.Avoid it.",4,0,2,23 September 2014
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Fairly Entertaining, but Ultimately, a Bit Vapid
","From time to time, I'm thankful that Aldous Huxley coined the term 'feelie' to describe a movie that thinks it can dispense with artful narrative and bull through with breathtaking scenery, general film technique, disconnected comedic chops, and 'aw, shucks' sentimentality. If Thurber saw 'Walter Mitty', I'm sure he'd agree that it's a feelie.I'm not saying it's a bad movie, just that it's not a good one; certainly not a great one. Tone is mismanaged, which is inevitable when you mold a script, paper mache-like, over the scaffolding of Thurber's concept, with a mere handful of plotty-twisty elements thrown in; like the rather tepid will-they-or-won't-they romantic interest that feels like it fizzled long before it arrived.In general, all the hard work folks did on this flick was doomed to mediocrity by lame scenario work and scripting--which I have no doubt was executed with great valor under looming deadlines, but still, 'no cigar'.A side negatory: The product placement really stuck out like a sore thumb; sorta adds to the 'feelie' factor, as well....The good stuff? Some great scenes; some wonderful acting, much by unknowns; occasional swashbuckling adventure action stuff that was kinda fun to watch; I found the unexpected intrusions of the e-Harmony support guy to be a hoot. I enjoyed the scenes with Penn; he's a matchless professional.I would tend to recommend that you not waste your time, IFF you feel your movie-going time is precious, and prefer really *great* flicks.",5,1,3,21 January 2014
Schindler's List," good movie, but with problems
","I enjoyed certain things about SL.  The story is quite good.  Technically, the movie is very good.  The acting is fine.But, seeing how this film stays near the top of the 'top 250', I feel compelled to rain on the parade a bit.  Forgive me if I use this forum to focus on what I *didn't* like about the movie:The scene at the train station--remember?  Where people were scrawling their names on their luggage, and loading it onto boxcars on another line, then the audience is let in on the fact that the system had no intention of reuniting them with their belongings?--set the tone for the representation of evil that was the holocaust.  It appeared that the immensity of the tragedy would be conveyed in this movie by equally grand and hauntingly indirect scenarios like this.  But then the movie settles into what I call the 'clean death' of countless shots to the head.  I'm not saying that they should have shown the knee deep typhus-dead in abandoned barracks, an actual gassing, etc., etc.  But the power of that train station scene subsequently wasn't matched by what came after.I also felt that the 'little girl in the pink coat' was a victim 'for the rest of us'; a furtive hedging-of-the-bets which I have a funny, funny feeling might have been more-or-less foisted upon Spielburg by his producers.  When we got tired of seeing Jews getting herded up and killed, the pink coat girl (who appeared to be a kind of goyim 'innocent bystander') sort of 'freshened our palates.'  And I think that's a poor substitute for more of the kind of effective and deeply moving stuff I alluded to above (the train station scene).If you want your gut blown re the holocaust, watch Shoah.",Null,2,5,11 January 2002

Well, maybe not *gold*, but something distinctly better than lead.Seriously: Once I smelled that premise, I staunchly decided to hate the flick. But I kept watching, and got swept up in the majesty of the execution; notably, the direction.I'd go so far as to class this flick with others about which it can be said that a great myth can cover many cinematic sins.

Gran Torino," Very well-meaning, but sadly lacking artfulness

But there are just too many holes in the acting, writing, and directing.One of the biggest oversights in production were 'gang' scenes where it appears that substandard actors were told to wing it. Boy, that sucks, and I can't tell you how much it pains me to see Eastwood letting that footage get edited in to something with his name on it.And this, coupled with other scripted scenes with lousy writing, just down the flick for me.Again: I really, really wanted this thing to work. It may be the perfect film to point to when you want to explain the inadequacy of best intentions in the face of oversights in realization.",6,7,12,6 June 2010

","Beautifully written, produced, acted; Eastwood continues to grow, and it's great to see that. May he continue to be the maverick who takes on stuff like this and do things few dare to do.You can't ask for better; a movie which says everything that needs to be said about the choice to make the search for truth one that involves a fight. For Dunn, life is a fight. Contenders for claims to the divine must run through searing heat, so the dross burns off and what comes out the other side is pure gold. This movie pushes us right into the volcano. Do we come out with or without hope that this process produces something ultimately beautiful? Sorry, but this movie declines to convince or reassure. That is for each of us to decide at the movie's end, just as we will have to assess at our lives' ends. If that sounds like a 'stone bummer, man,' then don't watch this film.This movie joins others, like Fellini's Nights of Cabiria, that dare to leave us with no clear and pat conclusions about the fates of the protagonists. In the end, the real issue involves our feelings as we face life's challenges--and deal with the outcomes, both desired and undesired. Will your final take on the fates of Dunn and his protégé relate in any way to your own life decisions as you face your future?",10,1,2,18 April 2006
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Smart thriller: Intelligent, truly thrilling, with a satisfying ending
","First, the ending: It's hard to end a movie. So many movies that start off like true labors of love somehow dwindle off into the sunset without a proper sense of finality; 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' (TGwtDT) doesn't have this failing. That's very important.Why do I like this flick? I think it's because the the filmmakers succeed in creating protagonists which are both larger-than-life *and* believable; a hard balancing act to pull off! You get drawn into their lives, and truly root for them. The admiration you feel for their exertions and stepwise successes is akin to how Watson felt when watching Holmes work. And yet another part of what you feel is hope and concern, which comes from the sense that they could be you. They're truly human-dimensioned, so the viewer is encouraged to settle in and identify with them.At the end of all this drama comes the exposing of a great evil--and it's believably banal in character; a very effective move by the producers and director.Speaking of which: Perhaps the most refreshing thing about TGwtDT is how it feels 'of a piece', and not afflicted with the kinds of narrative and character development abandonment associated with mid-project cold feet on the parts of the producers. It really does appear that everyone knew what they wanted from the outset with TGwtDT, and they stuck with it to the end. And as a result the product never disappoints the good-faith expectations of intelligent viewers. They might have copped out and done a midproduction rewrite that simply posits and sews up the original issue: The 15-year-old girl's disappearance. But the filmmakers decide that actual moviegoers have enough brain cells to rub together to grok the Heisenbergian uncertainty that's thrown in to achieve a lifelike tone.My one small remonstrance is that the voice-over work for the English dub felt about 95% there. There were occasional lapses in delivery that stuck out for me. One certainly hopes that the Swedish deliveries are 100% there! If you like mystery/thrillers, this is one you definitely have to check out.",9,2,4,15 March 2011
8 Mile," Odd mix of very good and very bad
","Everything is good about this movie except the core concept.The acting ranges from very good to astounding, the writing sometimes soars, cinematography and editing a pleasure to watch.  Even a certain amount of the development is pretty good.The faulty concept I'm referring to involves most of the elements of role and plot.  The 'love' interest is vapid (not the character, just the role, as developed), the main interpersonal conflict is pretty much a sterile, undeveloped 'white-hats/black-hats' sort of thing that lacks real depth. Some might say the depiction of sordid white trash life teeters artfully on the brink; I say it falls squarely over that brink and into the abyss. Sorry, I'm not going to say you can find redemption there, 'compassionate' though it might be to do so.  You can hawk anything you like at me as heroism, but I might not buy it.High points are actual performance footage.  Also, Eminem's character pulls off a clever moral coup at the very end (which I won't reveal, of course). This was certainly a valiant effort to redeem all that had gone before, but not quite enough, in my book.  I'm not just being facetious, by-the-way; it *was* pretty stunning.  But it wasn't enough to cover the sins of the first 95% of the film, which pretty much showcases degradation, in a manner so raw as to dare itself to engineer a redemption against very hard odds.  I suppose I should give this film *that*--in that respect, it was very ambitious, and that's admirable.I guess there is one other aspect of this film that seems a little weird to me; the crafting of an image of a white boy being taken quite to the heart of the black urban community (though not without some struggle).  An interesting idea, but I couldn't help but feel that only very careful artistry could mold such images and make them look as 'slice o' life' as this film does.  On one hand, this is a tribute to the artistry of this film, but on the other, it does mitigate against the idea that artists can always get their ways pushing any and all social envelopes with impunity.Wow.  I can't believe I've said so much about a movie that, in the end, I couldn't really bring myself to characterize as 'good'.  Maybe that says something in itself.See this movie if you want to see how far fine cinematic artistry will try to go to craft an image that would appear to spite social/racial convention in an elemental way.  If you like rap music, just be aware there's only about 10 minutes of rapping in the whole movie (more if you count occasional vocal rap background music over silent segments), and that it's all rap of the antagonistic 'challenge' variety, tearing down an opponent, full of filth, meanness, and venom, but sometimes so clever that you laugh out loud. The handful of belly laughs in this film didn't pay for all the cheepniz I had to put up with to get there.Yo.",Null,0,0,23 March 2003
The Adjustment Bureau," Call me a sap, but it worked for me
","There's a strain in the comments to the effect that the purity of Dick's message got sold out by the treatment. So I watched it with some wariness.But in the end, it worked for me. Yeah, the cinematic realization of the concept of spiritual intervention was kinda sorta klunky... Although I would be utterly tragically hip if I failed to tip my hat to the flash of campy sight-gagging on that theme! And, in the end, it was worth the investment of suspension of disbelief.Not the greatest venue for Damon's cache and skills, but not too chabby, either. At the end of the movie, I was quite touched and taken by the moral of the story. The proof lies in the following pudding: Given that there is no Adjustment Bureau, does the moral still ring true?*** Spoiler Alert ***. . .'Waking Life' said that 'dream is destiny'. But is Dick (and this movie) more aware of the underlying truth? Is the key to destiny really love?***spoilers off***: I gave this an 8 merely because I feel that psychothriller sci-fi rarely overcomes its idiomatic commitments to reality-basis to truly transcend and become timeless art. Though The Adjustment Bureau gave me a run for my money, my expectations weren't entirely exploded. If they had been, it would've gotten a 9 or 10.",8,14,23,7 March 2011
Hedwig and the Angry Inch," Great Rock 'N' Roll Movie!
","What a tough treat this movie is!First, it's just a great music movie; if you like well done screen musical performances, see it.  Think of it like Rocky Horror, with music that's actually 10 times better, and a script that doesn't leave a weird aftertaste.An engaging story, and a wild full-frontal assault on the clash between rhetorical and actual freedom.A slight warning:  I'm not sure whether the movie 'falls' at the end, or if it was just planned that way.  Just be aware that the 'plot' (such as it is) gets abandoned about 4/5ths way through, and it's up to you to decide whether what remains is a logical or esthetic next step toward some kind of high-level resolution.  It worked for me OK, but if it doesn't for you, you'll be forgiven.  For me, the movie earned the right to 'take off', be daring, and 'resolve' the way it did.Give it a shot.",Null,0,1,2 March 2003
Taken," Good for the genre
","I normally don't go out for action flicks, so I was sort of surprised by how Taken picked me up on a wave and carried me pretty well through, though with a few hiccups along the way.But, in the end, it's just an action flick. It's pretty predictable stuff, hence, no danger of 'spoiling' it. To wit: Enormously talented security dude, estranged from his family (because of his line of work), but still deeply loves his daughter. She's kidnapped. Dad jumps into the frey, saves his daughter. End of story! Lots of entertaining sleuthing, lots of kicking ass, occasional serious breaches of believability: Dad tells daughter 'don't go to Paris'...accused of paranoia...and, of course, the daughter is promptly kidnapped by Albania's only export to the West; politically-correct gangsters. Hero, faced with bursts of near-point-blank automatic gun fire, is not hit. He shoots a Paris police big-wig's wife in the arm, crashes many cars, kills many people; yet, when the action is finished, he hops on a plane with his daughter to fly back to the States.Some great subtlety in handling and pacing, but occasional firehose action sequences (esp. toward the end, natch) where you feared you were watching 'just another' action flick.I really do appreciate acting professionalism; and Liam Neeson is an absolute wonder. Great actors can do *anything*, and that's why Liam gets the big bucks.The main reason I watched this was because I saw Besson's name on it, and he gave us such great tours-de-force... I expected something like that, and instead I got a quite tolerable action flick treat.No moral complexity; real white/black hat stuff.Quite good for the genre. Even if action flicks aren't your bag, you might want to try this one out, to recalibrate your attitudes a little.",Null,2,4,15 January 2009
Alice in Wonderland," Pointless
","How do you cinematize a literary masterpiece? Now, don't assume I'm one of those purists who'll never be satisfied.Burton could have done one or more of the following things:1) Reproduce the original.2) Create a new, 'parallel universe' story that captures the same degree of subversiveness as the original.3) Modify the original to taste, but imbue Carroll's original images with a new power.Burton did not repro the original.He created a sort of storybook pastiche using the characters and a few scenarios from the original. But the subversion he engineers (Alice emerging to transcend the demands of class and status) is puny and tame compared to the big dogs that Carroll takes on.In a few, few instances, Burton did actually sort of grab me by the throat and make me see the depths of an original, Carrollian, image.For instance, when we first encounter the tea party, and the camera swoops in on the table, I was whupped upside the head by an inescapable, very dark realization: This is a harrowing depiction of the nature of spiritual madness. It starts out like a tea party, but the striving for stasis--the idea that we must try, at all costs, to preserve this beautiful moment--eventually turns it evil.But, really, that was about it.I also didn't appreciate (Spoiler Alert! Here comes my inner purist!) them calling the creature 'a Jabberwocky'. That oversight on the parts of the writers and artistic directors--whom one would have presumed to be Carroll aficionados--sort of took me by surprise. The creature is called a 'Jabberwock', and a poem celebrating its heroic hunting and demise could well be called 'Jabberwocky': This in the grand tradition of naming an ode after a noun by adding an '-y' suffix. If that seems nitpicky, just remember that Carroll was notably fastidious about such things.At any rate, I guess I would have liked to feel that the gang who produced this would have done a better job of artfully scraping away just enough of the aesthetic distancing afforded by the genre of Victorian Children's Literature that we could see with our own eyes (else what's cinema for?) a little more of Carroll's subversive otherworld.Instead we got a porridge (granted, thicker than gruel) of more of the Hollywood same.",6,1,2,21 March 2010
Up," A different feel from other Pixar films; but still good
","A friend warned me that I would feel disappointed by 'Up'. He said it just wasn't as clever and complex as Ratatouille or Wall-E or other past Pixar offerings.But another friend saw it, and recommended it, so I behooved myself to check it out.I agree with my first friend that 'Up' is a narratively relatively modest undertaking. But I also feel that what it does achieve is notable.It's taken a while for certain aspects to come to the fore in my mind. However, I did immediately notice one honest and useful moral: For all his exertions, Fredricksen doesn't get to really have an adventure until he lets go of a frozen, romanticized version of 'adventure' that got stuck in his character makeup at an early age. I thought it was great how the story sets this up and creates the situation where he has this breakthrough. Very nicely done.And then there were other interesting things the film achieves. The pacing of the story is odd. In a way, it's hard to say whether this reflects daring or ineptitude on the parts of the folks responsible for the shepherding the narrative. But, in the end, I have to say there was something grand about the way the story rolls along slowly and yet also with a lot of strength. It's as though it aspires to be operatic; with an emotional depth that tries to match the breadth of the spaces and times involved. Sort of like 'Waiting for Godot' meets 'Dennis the Menace'! I should mention that, about halfway through the film, the pace gets picked up, and stays 'up' for a long time; a bit 'too much', in my book, and quite likely a nod to the kid customers in the audience.And then there's that whole side story of Fredricksen's deceased wife (no spoiler there; you see this coming from a mile off). Very nicely done.With the proviso that, indeed, you will see something a bit different from prior Pixel work--no harm in variety!--I can recommend this movie.",Null,2,4,7 September 2009

And, on that topic, all the voice work was superb.It has neither special narrative twists nor a surprising, heady denouement; everything proceeds fairly according to plan.

","Just re-watched it. It was enjoyable and thought provoking, though a few things niggled.I can't help but think that the depiction of the computer interface would be much better done today. Cronenberg vests the production with brains and passion, and this made me overlook the hokiness of that representation. And as much as I can certainly see his straining for professionalism, Getz's work here is distracting. Was it a lapse in Cronenberg's direction?But it's safe to say these distractions can be set aside in order to mainline the payload myth, which has to do with... the nature of nature, at its most elemental. I suppose more folks might pick up on a 'tech hubris' message... and that's OK, too.If you haven't seen it, it's pretty much de riguour for buffs, so get it under your belt, already!",8,0,1,1 September 2018
Groundhog Day," A realization
","I just realized one of the reasons this movie is so great.It's great because it flew under the radar of the producers.So many movies succumb to 'producer syndrome', where the movie starts out great, but then turns sour and ends badly. And that's because 'the suits' get cold feet, decide to overthrow the director's vision, and start dictating artistic direction halfway through. It derails the film; and it never fails to sicken me when I see it: Films that suffer from this syndrome could have been great if only the producers hadn't panicked.Groundhog Day was a perfect movie to avoid this problem. Sure, it's got a pithy narrative with 'heavy' dramatic interest and serious darkness, but when the suits asked, 'Look, does he get the girl?' they could, in good conscience, say 'Oh, you betcha!' And when they asked, 'Does everyone live happily ever after?' they could answer with a hearty affirmative.And they achieve these producer-appeasing ends with a narrative in which, yes, (almost) everyone winds up happy, but all dues that need to be paid get paid, in full, and the process by which Phil is redeemed has a surprisingly honorable depth and resonance.So I was telling a friend that this movie surprised me because the influence of the producers was backwards; you see their influence in the beginning of the movie, but then they back off and let the creative people have their way.

","It's not like it's a particularly new idea: Lad seeks to find his place in society, intuitively makes a decision that breaks with tradition, becomes a pariah, succeeds in transcending tradition and then bringing his society into a new paradigm. An old story idea, told a million times.But in spite of the underlying staid character of the premise, this movie manages to work. I had no problem following Hiccup along on his little adventure. You revel in his truly becoming, not just a man, but a new kind of man, and a real leader.I dug it. I particularly enjoyed that, in the end, Hiccup did have to pay a price for his daring (won't spoil that). But he does bring the story to a heroic conclusion that I could get behind. It surprised me in that way! Good writing, good voice work, nice pacing and scenario work. Very well animated. I dug it! I hope we all can learn something about heroism from Hiccup.",Null,1,2,21 April 2010
Pulp Fiction," Rare: A film that could, maybe, change lives. Then again, I guess not
","It was a white-knuckler, for me. I don't normally go for action/suspense/suchlike, so this was a real roller-coaster. The scene where Willis returns from the 'Zed' scene and finally has a moment of tenderness with his girlfriend before she hops on the motorcycle to split town was an incredible tension release.The most amazing thing about this movie was that I found it to have a powerful prophesy for America buried in it's dark, edgy depths. When fate (or something like fate) saves our collective ass one last time from our arguably justifiable comeuppance, are _we_ going to find ourselves reflecting upon our internalized national mythologies and searching for the truths hidden therein, as does Sam Jackson's character? Or will we blow it off and continue down the path of self-gratification at any cost and deferred self-examination, as does John Travolta's character?I think 9/11 gave us our answer; the latter, not the former, popular protestations of spiritual reevaluation and reflection notwithstanding.One arguable bit o' fat in the movie: The sequence with The Wolf and the car clean-up and all that. It either should have been left on the cutting room floor entirely or rendered down a little. This is the *only* bit that detracts from the otherwise gem-like perfection of the experience. Because of the *almost* essential segue (our Heroes escape bullets, but the hapless kid doesn't) and the time element (Jackson needing time to reflect and decide to change his life), perhaps shaving it down a bit might have been the way to go.Tarantino is a prophet and true visionary, cleverly disguised as a little American boy who never grew up; the kind that likes blowing up GI Joes in the driveway.",10,0,1,17 July 2002
A Beautiful Mind," I can see why some think this flick is overrated. But...
","I can see why some think this flick is overrated. And, in some ways perhaps it is. But......buried in the arguably over-slick and buttons-pushing production is a profound metaphor, and as the storyline ramps up, the message is unmistakable. It has to do with the flimsiness of the dividing line between public and private psychoses. It's an important and ever-relevant idea, and its nice that it occurred to someone that a major motion picture might be a good venue for broaching it.I can think of two applications of this principle: Evangelical Christian environments, and--as directly addressed in this flick--'cold war' (now 'terrorist') paranoia.The Andrea Yates story, where a woman drowned her 5 kids rather than suffer the torture of 'knowing' that she'd screw them up and condemn them to perdition, is NOT a story about how religion drove a woman crazy. But the truth is, in a way, worse: It's a story about the blurring of the line between public and private psychoses; about how her church milieu willingly *masked* her break with reality. Yates's insanity reflects back on a social phenomenon that doesn't have the wherewithal to deal with the very thing it for which it vaunts itself to be equipped: After all, Christianity has its origins in the story of a man who, among other things, dealt effectively with mentally ill people. But all that's just a dim ancient myth as large swaths of contemporary Christian church culture now plow along, blithely aiding and abetting mental illness.And the story of A Beautiful Mind deals roughly the same blow to the mass psychosis of paranoia about the 'other', the nemesis, the enemy, somewhere out there, lurking, waiting to pounce, elsewhere in the world.The sad part of these systems is how a negative, aberrant minority uses these institutions, and exploits the permeability between the social/private minds, to produce societal effects that are as apparently tangible and eminently true as they are palpably life-disaffirming.I think the above interpretation summarizes the particular limb that Opie crawled out on, at great expense, to cinematically showcase.And, to reiterate my opening thought; yes, A Beautiful Mind is a kind of The Sound of Music with mathematics; with all the negative critique implications implied. But the work is crowned with the redeeming trait of its having shed light on perhaps the most important challenge facing decent society.",9,0,2,27 July 2014
Joker," Relentless. Cleverly addresses 'victim' culture
","First... MAN is this a hard film to watch. It's just so, so brutal. And TWO HOURS...!I guess, to me, the most important thing is that it makes certain invisible things, visible. And that's the job of good storytelling in general and film in particular. I found myself reflecting on the Coens' 'Fargo' film, and the invisible moral threads that establish the grandpa as an unwitting kingpin of a network of evil.And this film cleverly addresses 'victim' culture (very timely!) by 1) dealing with the fact that such claims have an 'invisible' component, then 2) burrowing in by knocking the supports out from under facile claims of victimhood.And that's all I'll say about that. Aside from a handful of really-not-that-important editing, directoral, and scenario decisions I found to be less-than-elegant, this is actually a pretty important film.Check it out.",9,1,1,13 October 2019
Whiplash," Pluses/Minuses, yet definitely worth the watch in any case
","Loved the way _Whiplash_ played perilously on the margins of the question of whether the teacher really cared or didn't care a whit about his young charge. The direction/acting/cut make it so that, at times, I was on the verge of concluding that the teacher really was, simply, an unregenerated, cold-blooded ba5tar9. It struck me that J.K. Simmons could easily have R. Lee Ermey whimpering like a little girl.The technical work around creating believable musical milieus was lovely. You really believed in the musicianship of all the actors.Not exactly a 'date' flick, eh? The strong allusion to the fabled mutual exclusion between the drive to excellence and boy/girl romance came off (to me) like a fatal dose of c0ckbl0ck. I can imagine loads of date couples walking out of the theater with dark clouds of impending argument/cold-shouldering trailing behind....I felt an overall pacing issue. We're invited to believe in the young man's initial musical/skill aptitude and his development over the timeframe depicted. At times, it _did_ feel like they pushed a little too hard. I can understand the constraints (and I feel another accolade coming on): The story was just too big for the standard time constraints of popular film practice. Whereas so many films feel like they go on too long--only to find that they faithfully hewed to the 90- minute running time--the ending of _Whiplash_ comes too fast. When the end credits start rolling, you blink in astonishment. And there was a bit of a 'time accordion' effect as you're watching the flick, like trying to squeeze a dockworker's ham-foot into a svelte high-heeled pump. Perhaps they should have created a double-length feature, with entr'acte, like the big-budget epics of yore. But I can imagine the suits at the studios doubting the worthiness of that tack, balking at the very idea. Damn their bottom-line eyes!Loved J.K Simmons in this. He was generally well-directed, and always amazes in taking direction. Speaking of direction, the only place where I felt there was a lapse was at the very ending, when J.K. was (I presume) directed to play it a bit over the top. Besides being poor direction, it struck me a bit unworthy of a flick about excellence in jazz, seeing how good jazz manages tone with control and taste. Kinda sad to see this little ball get dropped at the very end!But my remonstrances are minor compared to the overall impression, which is... very impressed, indeed.Great story, good production, (generally) good direction, fine acting, warmth, fire, charm, high drama, great music... really, a very worthy piece of film work.

The Wolf of Wall Street," Great in many ways, but a bit interminable... and could backfire
","The Wolf of Wall Street is a fantastic showcase. It showcases all the artists who create and inhabit the world depicted, including the tech (set/prop/etc.) folks.The writing/direction is good. Expressionistic/over-the-top, fun; effective at what it does.The only problem I had was that the flick seemed to be a kind of 'The Hangover'-with-money. In other words, it's this interminable expose of a hollow man; and that's not enough to take the film to the next level. You are treated to this cavalcade wild ride of big money adrenalin and bizarre drug abuse, and wind up sort of lost in that kaleidoscopic maze... for a long, long time. Then the film ends. It was a great vehicle for all the people involved, and I enjoyed it, as such. But bear in mind that, in the end, it's a kind of hollow snack.How is it hollow? Let's think about the moral dimension for a bit. It seems like Scorsese is trying to lay bare the amorality (at best; immorality at worst) of high finance. But doesn't this flick really just wind up scapegoating an over-the-top talisman of Wall St. excess? Aren't we supposed to chase the Wolf over the cliff, and then feel cleansed of sin? No: That wouldn't work; not with folks who think about the hard implications of Mammon worship. Which means, actually, that I'm wrong: 'The Wolf of Wall Street' would work just dandy, at a deep, subconscious level, with altogether too many people. And that is an unfortunate key effect Scorsese's approach to this story that actually bothers me.I like to think of Scorsese as a complex, challenging voice of moral conscience; but he seemed to have sort of lost his way with this flick. I think its effect is a perverse inverse of what a 'voice of social moral conscience' would intend. I think, for all the out-of-it, abusive, egregious affronts to decency, that the downstream effect is an apologetic for those affronts.I often think of one of my fave, direct, cinematic expressions of this kind of moral inoculation: THX 1138. There's a scene where one of the denizens of that underworld are flipping around the TV, and encounters a 24/7 channel which shows robocops beating up citizens. The idea is that, after being exposed to so much overt abuse, you speedily go through your cycle (rage, bewilderment, internalization) and then can get on with your passive role as a cog in a system. That's how I feel about the depiction of excess in 'Wolf'. Sadly, I think Scorsese missed the boat: We're already inoculated. Wall Street has long, long, long been disassociated from human value, and we have long, long internalized that disassociation as 'business-as-usual'. Do they really need Scorsese's help?",6,3,7,8 March 2014
"Hail, Caesar!"," I don't care _what_ the gang says: A fine, fine film.
","I number among those that are willing to let the Coens breathe. They explore a subject matter, tone, style here... and I for one think they navigate their muses' demands and the ensuing production process with panache and aplomb.Yeah, it's hyper campy; it's a parade of 'types'; it's a period piece; it's a multi-layer torte of splashy numbers and darkened office and salon intrigue; it's a bulging pastry puff with the creme of kookiness about to bust out; it's an unexpected birthday surprise to all the participating acting talent.And, en route, we're treated to two pretty heady payloads; a chimeric commie threat and the collision of the sacred and the truly, ultimately, unself-consciously profane.And, on top of all this, is the sense that the artifice is both laudable *and* eminently ignorable for the purpose of enjoyable delectation.Christ-all-fvekin'-mighty... what more do you _want_ from a flick?

The Green Mile," Better than the book, strange to say....
","This has got to be *the* best adaptation I have ever seen.I read the book first, which was a bit overwrought; the movie captures the essence of the story perfectly, digging out the veins of genuine narrative gold.The casting was superb. I've got to say, I got quite a hoot from encountering 'Wild Bill' in the movie. His character is so very colorful in the book, so I looked forward with keen anticipation to seeing how the actor would handle him. And it was...Sam Rockwell! And he played him *perfectly*, SPOT ON. Michael Clarke Duncan is fantastic as John Coffey. Really, everyone is great.Anyway, go see this movie. It'll give you a boost.",Null,1,3,28 September 2004
The Shawshank Redemption," Odd that this movie is so high on the IMDB top-250....
","I actually can't see how TSR wound up so high in the IMDB top-250.It was a fine movie in many ways, but I was disappointed that it didn't meet the expectations that had been planted in my mind by friends and family that wanted me to see it.  I had been led to believe that it was going to be a profoundly 'impactful' insight into the nature of love, brotherhood, the struggle for freedom, and, of course, redemption.  The movie for me was a little muddied by a couple of things.And it's hard to pin down.  I guess there was something 'dirty' about the idea that the redemption took the form of everything turning out rosy and perfect for Our Heroes; that it was an outer redemption, rather than an inner redemption.  It just felt as though the level of insight I was expecting would have to look a little more different from the 'standard' (as it were) firehose of hollywoodesque plot twists, black/white hat-ism, and rosy outcome.  To give you an idea of where I'm coming from, the redemption scene at the end of...Eraserhead(!)...is cleaner in my mind than Shawshank, just because we are forced to fill in the blanks left by a totally alien projection of spiritual struggle.  When we fill in the blanks, we have to draw upon the (in this case) redemption 'within us'; Shawshank seems to be attempting to fill in all the blanks, leaving nothing for us to do.  And, as I already said, some of the fill is questionable in my mind.Lastly, I was unable to pick up on a key plot element toward the end; how exactly did Andy 'nail' the prison officialdom?  It appeared he was able to 'hip' state oversight to the egregious abuses of power; but that a mere prisoner--even one vested with a certain amount of bureaucratic access--should be able to accomplish this seems impossible, and I was not even able to make out the general contours of such a mechanism in the movie. I'll admit I might maybe have to see the movie again.  And the movie was good enough that I might well do just that.  But, again, when friends/family/IMDB-user-commenters said this was a billion thumbs-up movie, I expected something somehow more challenging.",Null,0,0,14 April 2002
Rango," Chinatown: Set in 'the west', but where the good guy wins, and sans in**st
","My feelings are a little mixed, but you have to reflect a little and give credit where credit is due.Hands down: The producers reached out to folks like me who insist on good writing. Certainly they must have known they'd alienate large chunks of the ticket-buying polity who are put off by verbal finery, in much the same way they're put off by Bach: Too many notes. I'd be very, very curious to know the percentage of Rango's viewers who'd previously seen Chinatown. I'd guess 10%--and that's 5% happenstance, and 5% film buffs drawn in by word-of-mouth.They pulled a lot of stops to make Rango happen, and you have to at least tip your hat to that. There are story artists who feel a story, but also enjoy fine language, irony, and the cerebral contextualization of narrative. Ratatouille was a good example of the best that this can be; and kudos to Disney for evolving and recognizing this as the future of grand animation storytelling. The head doesn't have to be the enemy of the heart.Well, Rango seems to want to take this a step further. And in so doing, it might have tipped its hand a little too far and spoiled the feeling. There are long stretches of characters ambling across barren landscapes, exchanging barbs, witticisms, and naive pronouncements. Do people go to cartoons to wait for Godot? If they sometimes do, then the next question is: Is it worth the wait? In Rango, it rather is. Certain messages are delivered, the most important of which is: It's possible to get stuck in a personal storyline; an internal narrative with the power to entrance and delight in the short term, but ultimately powerless in the face of real world forces. And some of these forces are evil, and facing off these forces requires genuine heroism. And real heroism must break the chains of mere story. Only then can it become mythic in scope, and succeed.Rango does this, but you're going to have to wait for Godot for a spell. If you're not ready to do that, then you're going to be disappointed. But if you're patient and cool, who knows *what* you'll find in McElligot's Pool!",8,1,2,22 March 2011
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Throwing mine on the pile...
","Gotta say, with 400+ user reviews at this time, this comment is having trouble feeling significant!But I gotta back up my rating, right? It's simple: The piece feels like the very best of fine theatre, coupled with tremendous filmmaking craft, and yet somehow floating free of the curse of detectable artifice.This flick is an absolute jewel box of semantic riches, like a book that you can open randomly, plunk a finger down, and discover yet-another passage that blows your mind.For example, I was just now reflecting on the scene where the hero faces off the critic in the bar. That scene is a mind-blower, in that it masterfully--if not seemingly inadvertently--mitigates against its own self. The woman decries the death of art, and does so with such force that we could overlook the fact of how that scene shimmers with deep and beautiful artistry.OK, that's one example. This flick is both visual and experiential fine sculpture. In the same way that great sculpture invites you to brave its firehose of beautiful imagery as you circumambulate it, this film is a non-stop cavalcade of beautiful visual impressions and whirling, tumbling humanity.As _Capote_ was for PSH, and _Kill Bill_ was for David Carradine, I sense that _Birdman_ could be the performance of a lifetime for Keaton. Sure, I hope he continues to hew to this kind of daredevilry in the future, but... He has somehow secured something precious and timeless with this flick.",10,6,16,5 February 2015
Prometheus," Great premise; disappointing execution
","Prometheus is a fantastically made flick; some truly great dialog; fine acting; superb effects; from a mythic aspect, a damn sight better than most high-toned sci-fi.But I found myself, at one point, sort of shouting at the screen, 'What are you *doing*?!?!' And what were they doing? Is there absolutely no way they could have continued exploring the carefully groomed thematic premise, without sidelining the whole wondrous business by falling back on a stinger involving a bio-weapon bestiary? I guess that's my point: It's the tone. A good story has to manage the tone. The flick was doing very, very well, having settled on a tone involving a major step forward in the unraveling of the greatest mystery; the mystery of where we come from.But then there's this abrupt plot shift; an arbitrary-seeming looming danger. After a while, characters make the connection, and let us in on why the danger is there. OK. And the story sort of sews everything up at the end, as the hero whizzes off to further research this surprising and unexpected fillip in the story.But that doesn't change the fact that the effect, as the abrupt shift presents itself, is one of being slapped in the face and not treated like a discerning consumer of narrative.You kind of have to see it to understand. I'm not saying that the story 'let me down' by daring to shift gears. I love narrative that runs off the rails, if it's done well: I love the Coen Brothers' work. I'm saying that, in the context set up by the first third of the work, the introduction of scary little monsters really takes a steaming dump on something delicate and tantalizing. It did not make it more tantalizing, or artfully change the tone of the interest.It's interesting to note places where the writers thought they could plop in lines that would ameliorate the weirdness of the tone shift.Anyway.... I guess I have to say that, for all the fire and passion the producers invested in making this technically incredible artifact--and for all the obvious passion and clear-headedness they invested in the even-tempered and engaging first third--the net product is severely wanting. You should probably skip it.",6,1,1,10 October 2012
Paths of Glory," Very good. But...great?
","I enjoyed Paths of Glory well enough, but am surprised, for instance, that it ranks so high in the IMDB top 250....I see it as a formative film for Kubrick.  You can see the beginnings of his special emerging talent and interest; naming the names and delivering the dramatic goods without a bunch of extraneous matter; addressing those of us whose dramatic needs won't be satisfied by an appeal to worn-out and questionable moral assumptions endemic to film up to then (and still afflicting much of film today).However, there were problems.  It appeared to me that Kubrick was unable to transcend certain encumbrances of the medium of the time; character acting, 'stage' dialog and exaggeration, 'pulling of the punches' in some of the writing and development.Another thing:  I think of a line from 'Manon of the Spring', where Montand's evil, culpable character says:  'That would be just like [another villager]; to confess someone else's sins [to the priest]!'  And rightfully so.  And I can't help but feel this particular concern taints 'Paths'.  At its heart, it is very much a cinematic confession of the 'sins' of someone else (the French).  The fact that the story holds some promise of universal application doesn't to my thinking sufficiently blunt that core reality.*** Spoilers Ahead ***Another thing I couldn't banish from my mind as I watched was, as reprehensible as the depicted military courtroom procedure appears to our eyes, that it was a heck of a lot more than many Frenchmen received during WWI, when court martial procedures were very often hastily convened in bombed out buildings with the dust still in the air, based on flimsy 'evidence'; often patently subjective judgement calls on the fighting mettle of the accused; followed by throwing the 'convicted' up against the nearest crumbling wall and knocking them down with no more ceremony than taking a dump.  Heck, that's war, and it's largely unwritten and undocumented.  Which reminds me; when Douglas's character says 'I'm incensed that there is no stenographic record of this proceeding!'...then what did the writers base their script upon?  I do realize the above *does* describe much about the process shown in 'Paths'; the General was taking unfair advantage of the subjectivity taken for granted in determining the inner states of the accused, and to the extent this came from base promotional motives on the part of the general, it's a crime against humanity of unspeakable proportions, and I'm glad the story is being aired.  But it's just a drop in the bucket of the insanity of real trench warfare.  I couldn't dispense with that distracting thought during the movie.All the scenes in the cell where the condemned were held were fantastic, and show where Kubrick was headed in his career.  Great writing, presaging 'Sparticus'.  Not all the writing in the movie was up to that standard (though close).I didn't get the point behind the last scene, where the German girl sings and the French soldiers are deeply moved.  It was a great scene (great!), but I couldn't for the life of me achieve the integration of that scene with the rest of the movie, and I consider myself perfectly amenable to doing the bit of work to make those kinds of connection on behalf of well-intentioned filmmakers.  If there was a spiritual connection, I didn't quite see it.  I think it was an end-game botch.  When you look at the story, you realize that there was no resolution possible, because you can't bring the executed soldiers back to life.  But Kubrick & Co. needed to find a resolution anyway.  Perhaps the dawning investigation into Gen. Paul Mireau's shennanigans and Dax's vehement denial of self-aggrandizing motives should have been left ringing in our ears.  I don't know.  I understand why they had to have *something*...In summary.  See this movie; it's good, and an important step in Kubrick's work.  Decide for yourself if it all comes together as a moral fable.",Null,1,1,18 December 2002

Blade Runner," Must See
","One of the great films of all time.This one has had to simmer in my brain for a few years, and it's not finished yet.  I've never been so impressed with a message at once profoundly spiritual, and also humanist--in fact, integrating those two stances, antithetical for some.  Is it true?:  That it's only meet and just to want to kill God and then forgive all others?I'm also reminded of the line from Voltaire's proto-sci-fi short story Micromegas:  'J'ai été dans des pays où l'on vit mille fois plus long-temps que chez moi, et j'ai trouvé qu'on y murmurait encore.' (I've been in countries where they live a thousand times longer than we do, and they still complain that life is too damn short).Yet another observation about the brilliance of the movie (and *not* a spoiler, but perhaps an enhancer):  The background depiction of off-planet 'white flight' is utter genius.  Was that P. K. Dick's concept?  But the in-your-face-yet-understated way Scott showcases this setting is a powerful...what?...indictment?  Hard to say; he simply tosses the image onto your lap like a 400lb lap dog and says, 'Deal with it.'  Incredible, and all-too-seldom seen in cinema.Also:  A usefully oblique precursor intro to our present day (2003) wrangling over the ethics of cloning.A must-see; even for those for whom sci-fi is not their 'thing'.  Watch it and deal with it.",10,0,1,1 February 2003
Signs," Ugh!
","NOTE:  Bear in mind that I sat down in the theater to watch this movie with *very* high expectations; ready to suspend my critical facilities a bit and let the director work some magic on me.  I did my part.That's it.  I'm giving up on this director.  It's not that I expect every one of his movies to deliver the same payload that 'The Sixth Sense' did; but I expect him to deliver *something*.This movie was a....well, I was about to say 'a mess', but that's not it. It was just plain insipid.  A stupid failure on many fronts.*** spoilers ***I was very curious about and full of anticipation for the resolution on the early characterization of the emotionally closed family.  I guess the dinner table crying scene was supposed to be that resolution.  Or something.  But it didn't get resolved in a satisfactory manner.The aliens were stupid.  The film was like a couple of neighborhood kids making an alien movie during their summer break, except their neighborhood is Palos Verdes, and they have millions in their budget.  'OK, let's make 'em *reeeeel* creepy, y'know!  Like, with big; I mean really *BIG* gross fingernails!  Yeah!  And they have to have reeeeeally scary teeth!  Yeah, like, and like, they don't have toothpaste on the planet they come from!' In the larger view, the aliens were like a weird carbuncle on the hiney of this movie.  I did not see the point of even having aliens in this movie, except it was not impossible to dovetail them into the clumsy skeinwork of the plot.The dialog gives new depth and meaning to the term 'wooden.'  And I do mean that; it's not wooden in the normal sense.  Maybe the correct descriptor is 'waxy;' like dialog that wax museum dummies might exchange.  It's unremittingly and interminably clever, seeking to find it's trenchancy within seconds of expression, vs. laying back a bit and contributing to the building up of a powerful scenario or storyline.  The few places where cross references happen (e.g., Mel's wife's last dying words and the alien confrontation scene) are so contrived and cheap you can see the duct tape holding the plot together.The sad thing about a movie like this is that its failure is obvious.  You could plainly see that the director was trying to say something about the power of the spiritual; and he failed.  He tried to say something about providential reasons for accepting individual quirks and seeming flaws in the people around us; and maybe only delivered on a dimly intellectual level.  He tried to say something about the positive impact of adversity on our deeper selves; and dropped the ball.  When, at the end, I saw Gibson dressing up in his collar to do his priestly rounds again, I could see why this was supposed to make sense from the standpoint of the director's good intentions, but shook my head that this movie simply failed to bring so many of us along for that ride.I guess I've said enough.

Lucy," Weak
","It's sad to see Besson sort of losing it. There's a footlooseness in Lucy that reminds you of his early stuff: But his early stuff is more enjoyable. It's hard to pin down exactly why. But I'll try.Lucy loses it because it's just plain weak. The premise and setup is morally hazy. It just doesn't compute, in the sense of metabolizing into compelling development. I think that, as time goes by, I have less and less patience for hyperbolic, action-flick, urban fairy tale-style 'evil'; and this flick's setup sequences establish exactly that. Sorry, but I guess I prefer human-dimensioned evil in my urban fairy tales, unless you're pointing the projectile over the wall of my credulity and firing all rockets, like, say, Robert Rodriguez, or a lot of fantasy/sci-fi (like Guardians of the Galaxy).To me the whole sideshow involving Freeman and his coterie was an attempt to gussy the proceedings up with a Greek chorus. It was supposed to add theoretical rigor/gravitas, but just winds up coming off like cheap VO exposition of dubious scientific provenance, writ large.There is a mythic element, and it's the ongoing play on the concept of a young woman moving toward an inadvertent, human-manufactured goddesshood, a la Dr. Manhattan. OK, that's sort of cool, and the film does deliver something compelling on that myth. It redeems the flick a little. But it still doesn't feel like enough. It's not an adequate basis for a 90-minute sitting.In general, I found the film weak, and weakness in a film irritates me.I can't recommend it.",6,0,2,13 January 2015
Godzilla," Kinda 'Plan 9'ish... but still enjoyable.
","I really would like to know why this flick is earning scads of IMDb ratings below 3! I guess I'll do a survey of the comments and look for a commonality.One thing for sure: There *is* a sort of 'Plan 9' feel to the plot lead-up. It was beginning to look like we'd be left high/dry with respect to a binding mythos that lends credence to the concept. And then we finally get to the scene at Monarch where things sorta start to get explained; but it sounded a bit hollow, to me; like the alien fellow's speech in Plan 9 about why alien intelligence urgently needed to intervene in Earth matters. Yeah, it made a sort of sense, but... not really. They try to palm Cranston's character off as one of those crackpots-who-knew-all-along, but in the end it doesn't gel. You get the distinct feeling that Cranston's character was supposed to be tragic; but sadly, due to thematic mismanagement, he comes off as a bit pathetic.Now, I've never been a monster aficionado: As a kid, I tended to get scared easily, and wouldn't watch monster flicks, even while my buddies loved 'em. So I'm trying to play catch-up here. But I sense that the key to making a flick like this work is to skip the pretenses to high-toned theatrics and go for the gut: Create a visceral sense of power and primal, atavistic, animal angst. I really don't understand, in the least, all the commenter remonstrations to the effect that there's not enough monster action. There's plenty, plenty, plenty of very tastefully choreographed monster action in this flick; and it's powerful, primal, angry... all that!So, in the end, I give this guy a 7: It's not timeless art, but the producers, et.al. sought to paint a very big picture, and a big picture is delivered. For that, alone, it deserves more than the weird reprisal ratings it's been receiving.",7,3,6,26 August 2014
Life," Genuinely horrific; lovely stylizing
","Man, this flick is getting slagged off at!It really isn't worth all that negative energy. There's just too much to recommend it.What do people hate about it? Seems folks've decided it's a premise rehash of the 'Alien' series. I say... eh... sure, it's a kind of hurdle that the film would need to clear to hold our attentions. But I feel the film clears that particular hurdle nicely. It makes stylistic decisions that mark it as a clean, new approach to the whole sub-genre of 'contact' films. At any rate, sizing it up against 'Alien(s)' to me seems like a tepid basis for a negative evaluation.What I appreciate is how enormously crafty the whole enterprise (of making this flick) is. The writing, pacing, editing, direction, everything comes together to make something... artful. And I *always* like to see artfulness in a movie. Not enough of that.There may some divergence from this view on the basis that the film plods, or otherwise fritters itself away with a deficit of needed 'action'; I say; the balance of action and interstitial quiet dramatics as the crew attempts to resolve its ever-morphing 'issue' is perfect. One of the things I really loved about the flick was the writing; the dialog. I was surprised to find that the writing drew me in with its simplicity and plaintiveness. You really believe these are folks on a space mission--highly educated and trained, with distinguishing qualities of character--but ultimately just folks... you, me, anyone. Great, great writing, and seen too, too seldom in movies these days. Refreshing!So all that's really left is an overview of the story management, and technique in general.I'm thankful that the story had an decent ending. Ending a story well is like an end-game in chess; the hardest part of the game. I thought the flick ended a damn sight better than all too many others.In terms of general technique, I found the sets, visuals. and effects in general to be fine and conducive to the suspension of my disbelief; I could 'relax' and take in the harrowing narrative.Will you like the movie? Depends. I think I pretty much outlined the issues, above. If attention to the kinds of details I mention above don't rate much in your enjoyment of movies, odds are you shouldn't waste your time with this one: You'll probably wind up resenting the wasted time, and chiming in with other naysayers in these User Comments. Have a look at some of them to see what I mean.",9,0,2,28 August 2018
Jackie Brown," Endearing
","There a great deal in Jackie Brown (JB) that has the potential to warm the cockles of a movie-lover's heart.First, it's simply a well, well constructed flick. If you love solid filmic storytelling, you'll marvel at the conception and execution.There's a kind of built-in wonderment at the release of JB relative to Tarantino's earlier work. It doesn't pack the same kind of punch as Dogs or Pulp. But the punch it *does* pack is no less significant... and the contrast is appreciated.The characters are fantastic studies in character. In a nutshell, JB is (among other things) a kaleidoscopic bestiary of sociopathy. I don't think it's a spoiler to advise that, as you take stock of these various nuances and degrees of criminal mind, you should cast your net very widely: Perhaps only the cops come anywhere near to being truly morally clean--remember that as you're watching the concluding action.Tarantino's penchant for dusting off and deploying yesteryear's faces is very well served in JB. Forster is an absolute delight.Speaking of cutting edge casting, Tarantino's against-type and subtle direction of heavy-hitters like DeNiro and Tucker (especially the former) is a joy to see. DeNiro takes direction humbly and very well to create a truly DUMB persona. Louis is loyal, dutiful, not-without some moments of rugged sagacity... but slathered over it all is a translucent sauce of unfortunate, dogged dimness. And it's all nicely integrated in a superb character and narrative mix.And there's more! I could go on! But I won't. Watch it.I give it a '9' because the profound mythic dimensions of Pulp Fiction sort of set a high bar.But don't judge JB too harshly on those terms.",9,1,2,1 July 2016
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Funny because it's true
","What can I say? I went to see Holy Grail when it first came out, oh so many years ago. And what an amazing thing it is, in so many ways.For one thing, it certainly sets a standard for excellence on a small budget. This should cause much rejoicing among film students.I had a great interaction with my son-in-law on this. He's a next-generation fan of Holy Grail. But when I mentioned the film's insights into morality and human nature, he was a little taken aback. I gave one example; where Sir Robin gives the 'canned' response to the bridgekeeper's question, 'What's yer favorite colour?' The joke is funny because it's a clever portrayal of everyday cowardice. And from there, the analogy expands. Cowardice begins with the denial of our own thoughts and feelings, out of fear of confrontation. What we have might be insight, but out of cowardice we hide it under a bushel. We can laugh at Palin's portrayal of this, but there's a whole other level; a powerful, tendentious payload. There exist tragic souls who take this attitude to ungodly extremes; denying what they really feel to the bitter end of self-worth, of relationships, and even of life. And that's the genius of this scene; that Palin is, indeed, dispatched to the Chasm of Eternal Peril (or whatever it's called). It was a small thing, really; a kneejerk reaction to a harmless query about his own color preference. But the end thereof is Death. And don't you forget it!And there are lots and lots of insights like this in Holy Grail. If you think I'm being too analytical, well, all I'm doing really is scraping the surface away in an attempt to explain the fact that many, many people find this to be a timeless classic. I'm just saying, 'And for good reason.'",Null,6,11,19 May 2006
Inside Llewyn Davis," Beautiful
","It's a great story, incredibly well told.The Coens continue to hone their own craft, and work with able others to create truly fantastic spectacle. Watching this comes close to tipping me over to the view that they do drama better than they do comedy... but I'll demur: They're non-overlapping magisteria.I've observed other very good, very descriptive comments in these IMDb User Comments, so I'll leave it here and send you there. The stuff folks point out--the faithful reproduction of intimate artistic moments; a portrayal that makes the invisible visible; all production details lovingly attended to--is wonderfully true.My only qualifier to all the above comes down to whether you find this kind of slice-of-life, everyman heroism compelling.But I'll add this: If you tend to characterize all that as hoity-toity art-house frippery, I'll send you to this flick, anyway: I daresay it just might bring you around.Check it out.",10,2,3,14 September 2018
Her," Gorgeous writing!
","I was stunned at the incredible quality of the writing in Her. For starters, it's rare to find good film (or comics or narrative, in general) writing for specialist jargon; and the technical lingo and formulations in Her didn't make me cringe, not even once. It's an interesting, fine line: I didn't expect Jonze to have taken out a year to make a study of the literature in AI and Computer Systems. He just had to have a basic idea of a few precepts, from which he was free to 'wing it', as long as he modulated it a bit and drew back from gratuitous tech-speak for its own sake. This, he did, IMHO.Next, there's simply that the scenario of Her is one with breathing room; there's room for endless, interesting development, including the creation of characters and character interactions that reflect our own lives and concerns. Then, we can feel their triumphs, pangs, passions (however ephemeral). Amazingly, Her does all this.There was such a sense of wholeness and integrity to the production, that 'controversial' elements (involving sex/nudity/'personal stuff') came across as essential points of character and relationship development. Her makes it plain, right out of the gate, that certain cases are going to be made. And armed with this psychological preparation, subsequent action may not go down easy--sometimes, it's not supposed to!--but thankfully doesn't grate our sensibilities, on account of a lack of presentation artistry.I loved the way hi-to-mid-to-lo tech seemed to be artfully modulated; as though Jonze was orchestrating these things. It made the higher-tech depicted feel imaginable. As challenging as it was to understand Samantha, the lo-tech of the seaside picnic scene presented an unexpected, shocking twist; a challenge to *continue to ultimately see* Samantha as an AI system. And the mid-tech (e.g., office sets) remind us that, while we may not have love affairs with our computer systems, we often blandly/blindly take job/lifestyle/quotidian tech for granted. And one healthy side effect of a flick like Her is to craft a depiction of mid-tech that draws our attention to it and makes us reflect on it.Her is, in effect, very much an attempt to couch a doctoral thesis on tech-acceptance/pop-culture as a very watchable movie.Add to this a plethora of other notable achievements. For one thing, it's a tour-de-force take on AI--in a sci-fi film field drenched with CGI-encrusted must-kill-all-humans dystopian action fantasy. The acting is human and close-to-the-bone. It strictly hews to taking on matters of love, not power(!), which is a stunner for a flick that has AI as its central theme. To flesh in my opening comment at the top of this post, all aspects of the writing shine; it has zingers, it has arc. It has heart.The film does such a good job of achieving its apparent goal that it vaults the wall and takes us into another realm; where, finally, 'the rest of us' can partake in otherwise rarefied ruminations on the morality and ethics of machine consciousness.Highly recommended.",10,0,3,17 June 2014
Back to the Future," Just watched the trilogy again (2008)
","What can I say; it's the usual Spielberg/Zemeckis sensibility; a little dumbed-down and 'B-movie'-ish, while delivering genuine humor and pathos.They're movies 'for the masses;' the writing, scenario work, pacing, directing is carefully designed to fill in the blanks for our slower brethren, but it works on many levels and has something for everyone.After all these years, it's still a great trilogy.Which reminds me of perhaps the most amazing thing of all. In stark contradiction to the immutable law of sequels, the trilogy gets better with each installment; the third is a marvel, feeling like the storyline has reached maturity. Perhaps, by the time they were shooting the third, the money folks backed off a tad and let the creative people breathe: You can feel it. The hyperbolically directed leads are actually given some slack to ply well-honed stage-style theatrical skills, and it looks and feels well-rounded and true.Also, the film is simultaneously dated--'80s American youth values, without serious circumspection--and yet somehow timeless. Perhaps the feeling is that there *is* a kind of circumspection; that Marty, by story's end, has actually grown a little. Always nice to see some of that leak out of a 'pop' movie.",Null,0,0,18 September 2008
Jurassic Park," Dumb movie
","I went to see this original Jurassic Park when it first came out.At the time, I was struck by how really, really dumb it was. Over time, I've come to recognize what it was I'd seen: It was a nasty case of Producers' Cold Feet Syndrome. Possibly compounded by the Director and other artistic voices not having the cajones to countenance those dumbing-down voices and redeem the exercise a bit.The characters are reduced to cartoon caricatures. The flick plays like a first-draft storyboard animatic. Driven by the producers' knee-jerk responses to dailies, the 'denouement' is funneled into an insulting joke of a resolution. And they think the whole exercise in narrative dim-wittedness can be redeemed by closing out on an off-the-shelf, one- size-fits-all 'geez-aren't-kids-'n'-family-just-the-coolest-thing' scene.I give it one star (over the minimum '1') because you can see that some folks tried. They really did. But... No Cigar. A lot of money spent on a big nothing'.",2,2,17,4 December 2017
The Wizard of Oz," a milestone
","People talk about The Wizard of Oz as a backdrop to their lives; and how true that is. I just saw it again, DVD, for the first time in--gosh!--20 years. There was a little art house in Lansing Michigan USA that ran it back then, on the popular premise that there's nothing like TWoO on 'the big screen.' That's the last time I'd seen it, 'til today.I guess the part that 'gets' me about the movie is how the writers made it pretty plain that the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion really already had what they thought they were missing; that their respective problems were in misapprehending their own complete natures. That's a powerful statement for many of us. I found myself most touched in scenes where the Scarecrow was showing wisdom, the Tin Man feeling deeply ('...when I think of Dorothy in that awful place...'), and the Lion...well, maybe accomplishing this effect was harder in his case...what *is* true courage?Anyway, if you're reading this here, you must be a movie weenie, and you've no doubt already seen the movie, so I'm not going to recite the usual 'go see this movie' mantra.I was just very touching to see this movie again, at this phase in my life.I will mention a few more things about how I now see this movie as a 'growed up' (I'm almost 50): It's interesting how you can see the production values of the time; the lot sets and special effects and so forth. This movie is a powerful example of how a good story overcomes limited means in other areas.People who look back with disdain on the low-tech chintz of old movies can see in TWoO the magic ingredient; narrative solidity. And I'm not a pollyanna about this: I'm sure the underlying reality behind its making is rife with horror stories of expert disagreement, rewrites, discarding, jerryrigging, and the rest of it. But in the end, something like narrative love won out; and that's the important thing.Oh: And having Harold Arlen write the music was good luck indeed. And orchestrations which cleverly appropriated very tasty new ideas in composition (polymodalism, non-standard phrasings, etc.) didn't hurt, either!Geez, this movie is such a little universe....I'd better stop here.",Null,153,195,12 November 2004
High Fidelity," Fun, fun, fun flick...with a bullet!
","I must take a minute to honor the Summary line of another commenter:  High Fidelity just might be the ultimate chick flick gracefully and effectively masquerading as a guy flick.  The love element is as boldly subtle as a cannonballing freight train loaded with goose down.  This is a movie about love.  This is a movie about spirituality.  I was hit by the metaphor of 'top five' (same for 'top ten', etc.).  This is a reflection on the way spirituality obliterates lists, levels, medals, hierarchies, comparisons. The hero is lost in comparisons, just as he is lost in his fetishising of his 'top five' songs, breakups, etc.  Watch how this evolves through the movie.Ironically, my sensitivity to this may well have some relation to my reluctance to contribute the numeric values to movies that contribute to the IMDb 'Top 250'!  'Ts not my thing, man....And, while you're at it, be sure to just enjoy the writing and deliveries of this movie.  The characterizations and timing are fantastic, all 'round; kudos to each and every participant!  I will take the liberty of making special mention of Jack Black:  What a monster!  I get the impression that he's not just a one-note johnny.  But I'll have to see more of his work to find out for sure.See this movie; with your boy/girlfriend!  And get out there and find true love!  Have a good journey.",Null,0,1,22 January 2003
Up in the Air," Bingham is the ultimate schlemiel
","Reitman the Younger is a true wunderkind. Of course, it's reasonable to assume that his first correct move is in picking great, compelling stories, and the story of Up in the Air is a winner. After this, his screen writing, casting, direction, editing, etc. are wonderful.The depth of the story is highlighted by the fact that it took me a while to realize probably the most important fact of the larger scenario into which UitA is a window. It's that the people Bingham serves so slavishly--it's not enough he subjects himself to this; he creates and hosts presentations to siphon others into his lifestyle--would never subscribe to the lifestyle he idealizes. The people Bingham serves (and whom we never see in the movie) are thereby enabled to create a cash-intensive, hothouse facsimile of the lifestyle he derides with every word, every action, every breath. In short, it's important to recognize that Bingham is a schlemiel; perhaps the ultimate schlemiel.",9,0,2,12 May 2013
