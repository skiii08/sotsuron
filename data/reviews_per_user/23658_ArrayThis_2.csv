Blade Runner 2049," A Masterpiece
","Better than the original with more emotional depth, stunning visuals and character development. I'm surprised the movie is rated as high as it is though given we live in a world where intellectually bankrupt marvel movies rank at the pinnacle of cinema. You need patience and insight to truly appreciate Blade Runner 2049 for the masterpiece it is.",10,2,8,5 May 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Ray & Kylo Redeem Otherwise Bland Film
","Daisy Ridley (Ray) and Adam Driver (Kylo Ren) turned an otherwise failed Star Wars movie into a better than average film. Daisy's acting in particular was top notch and her scenes were the only ones with true suspense and intrigue. All of the other side plots were directionless and unnecessarily time consuming. It seems the director and writers tried their best to make this film a disaster with Fin and Rose's story line, the pungently bad purple haired captain and an unbelievabley incompetent First Order fleet.",3,0,0,17 December 2017
