Blade Runner 2049," Too long sequel of the better original Blade Runner
","You need at least read something about the original Blade Runner to understand a bit what is going on in BR 2049. The story in this sequel is very thin and it is all about the miracle that if you have sex with a replicant you can make her pregnant.... Well if you believe that in the near future something as replicants are possible you probably also can believe that they can get pregnant. I liked the original BR very much not in the last place due to the brilliant role played by the dutch Rutger Hauer. In BR2049 Sylvia Hoeks, also from the Netherlands, plays a very good role too and the same goes for Ford and Gosling. But the movie is way too long, too slow and the stupid scenery with the artificial girlfriend are really stupid. The sphere is dark and pessimistic, the special effects are great and so is the sound (sometimes the sound created a dark atmosphere as well although nothing was happening...) but the story, is as said before, not good and the movie should have been not longer than two hours. I saw the movie in the cinema but a few times had to fight not to fall asleep because of the slowness of the movie. Could have been much better and the 8.6 on IMDb.com is absolutely way too high! Check it out for yourself if you still want to....",6,6,13,13 October 2017
It," Ridiculous horror-movie
","I watched this movie mainly because of the good review on imdb.com but WTF?
What a ridiculous story with a clown who appears every 27 years in different appearances and kills children.
Nothing makes sense, nothing is logical and evrything about this movie is stupid.
And for Pete's sake: it also lasts a long-winded 135 minutes!
The clown looks like Alien with make-up with his opening yaw and rows of teath.
A waste of time this 'movie' and luckily I did not pay anything to watch it because than I would have really felt screwed!!!",4,1,1,22 January 2018
Hereditary," Utter nonsense
","This is a dumb movie with some scary moments combined with scary music.
But the story is utter nonsense, the ending stupid and the whole thing lasts 
more than two hours.
The acting is pretty good and so are the stunts but for the rest it is a movie with all the known ingredients like appearing ghosts, strange sounds etc etc.
Only watchable if you are so fond of horror or horrorlike movies that you don't want to see anytghing else.
For those of you who have a nornmal movie-taste: stay away!
And the 7.3 for this movie on imdb is an outrage!",3,3,6,23 September 2018
Deadpool 2," Strange movie which is all and nothing
","Deadpool 2 is a strange movie. It is a mix of a comedy, although the longer the movie lasts the more annoying the character Deadpool becomes, SF and an action-movie. It has a lot of violence in it which in a certain way is funny but also is gross. The reality is not present and off-course in a movie as this it is more or less logical but mutants with superpowers which can be contained by a 'Radioshack'-like necklace? Come on....
Then this Juggernaut who is so strong that with one blow a bridge and heavy truck are damaged but is unable to escape his prison? And than the 'Terminator'-twist? Wow, that is the best the writers could do?
No, this Deadpool 2 is a big disappointment especially compared to the first movie. Do not waste any money on this lame movie!",5,0,2,5 September 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," Very stupid movie
","I liked the first Thor-movie a lot and the sequel 'The Dark world' was also not bad but not as good as the first thor.
And now we have Thor Ragnarok and by God what a terrible movie!
The story is stupid, the monsters are also, the sister Hela is terrible, Jeff Goldblum as some sort of gay ruler in a garbage world is extremely stupid etcetra etcetra....
In fact the whole movie floats only on the special effects (as a lot of Hollywood-movies do lately) and you must be childish to like this movie.
I can not understand that this absolute monstrosity of a movie is reated so high on imdb.com because it is an extremely stupid movie intended for children or people with an IQ lower than an monkey.
Disney should pay me money for loss of 130 minutes of my time!",4,3,6,27 March 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Childish Spiderman-movie with dumb story-line
","In this Spiderman-movie we see Peter Parker as he struggles at school to impress the girl he likes and at the same time waits at a call from Iron-man to help to save the world. I personally do not like the mixture Iron man-the Avengers-Spiderman as I believe that the character of Spiderman is strong enough for a movie without Iron man or any other Marvel-character. The story is pretty stupid because a villain (Michael Keaton) is making and selling powerful weapons with alien-technology and nobody seems to care. Only Spidey and as he tracks down the source Iron-man tells him to back-off. Why? And neither the police, the FBI or the so-called Damage Control seems to be interested in catching the criminals who sells the alien-weapons. The special effects are great and that is the only positive thing to tell about this movie. It is a stupid and childish movie and not doing justice to the character of Spiderman. If you still want to watch it: rent it or even better download it because it is not worth spending money on.",6,26,42,2 October 2017
Suicide Squad," Stupid movie
","I saw this movie without knowing anything about the characters. The story is really awful, stupid and not logical at all. Why would you gather same dangerous criminals combined with a powerful witch to make it a squad which has to save the world from other dangerous criminals? Nothing is really logical in this movie and even the character played by Will Smith is not entirely bad. The special affects are very nice but once again the story is stupid and so are the characters. This is absolutely the worst movie I have seen in a long time and I don't understand that it has a 6,7 on IMDb. Do yourself a favor: do not waste money or time on this absolutely STUPID movie!",4,1,2,10 October 2016
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Interesting movie with implausibilities and an unsatisfactory ending
","A lot of very high reviews on imdb.com for this movie but it is not as good as it seems.
The storyline is interesting about a mother who rents three bilboards to put up texts in order to force the local police to come into action to investigate the death of het daughter closer.
The sheriff has cancer and has two little daughters but does not much about the case. His deputy Dixon is a real asshole and it is unreliable that he is not fired.
It is also very unreliable that he changes his attitude 180 degrees only because of the letter he receives after rhe suicide of the sheriff.
And than there is the violent ex-husband of the mother and this unpleasant man has a 19-year old good-looking but dumb girl on his side. Yeah, right...
The mother sets the police-station on fire and almost kills the deputy but the new sheriff does not even check het story although she is at the scene of the crime and the obvious suspect.
And than there is the more or less open ending, a phenomenon that you see more lately but what I absolutely dislike!
For me this movie was, after all the positive rating and talk about it, a disappointment.
An interesting movie with however too many implausibilities and an unsatisfactory more or less open ending.",7,0,2,26 March 2018
Baby Driver," Overrated and exaggerated movie
","Due to the high rating on IMDb.com I had high expectations of this movie. But boy, what a disappointment it was! The car stunts are great but the story is ridiculous and lot's of the events are hard to believe or just stupid. For instance when Baby pushes the car of his opponent into an elevator shaft, the guy miraculously escapes from the car. yeah, right... Or when Baby shoots him from 1 meter distance in the chest he survives and is able to fight etc as if nothing has happened. A good movie as a lot of people state at IMDb? No, absolutely not. It is one in the same range as the Mummy: good stunts and/or special effects, a dumb story and a lot of things going on that don't make sense or are impossible. If you want to watch this movie: rent it cheap as it is not worth your money.",6,5,10,24 September 2017
Justice League," Great special effects without a proper storyline
","I like the movies with Batman, Superman, Spiderman and also Iron man as stand-alones in which only that hero appears.
In Justice League there are 5 heroes and that does not work at all.
But it could have worked but the biggest flaw is the storyline which is really terrible and idiotic.
Three separate boxes, when united, can destroy the world????
And this is what the villain Steppenwolf want to do. He has superpowers but does not stand a change at all when Superman appears again after he is raised from the death (what???).
Come on: the storywriters in Hollywood make loads of money but can't come up with a better story than this? Maybe they used to much of the white powder and can't think straight anymore? It looks like a five years old child came up with this story....
The only reason that I rate this movie a five is because of the special-effects but overall this is a bad movie and a waste of 120 minutes.
Stay away and look for a better movie, which can not be difficult.....",5,0,0,12 March 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," Mixing all Marvel-characters created a stupid movie
","I like most of the Marvel-movies although the last ones like f.i. Black Panther are not very good. But a 8.6 on imdb: Infinity war must be a great movie!
Well, it was NOT and unbelievable that it has a 8.6 on imdb!
Throw in all the characters you have from the Hulk to Spiderman and mix it with Black Panther, Thor and the Guardians of the Galaxy and than you have a mix which is not taste or good at all. Add a dumb story about a villain, who needs an iron fist to become powerful and if he succeeds in collecting six stones than he will be able to minimize the population in the universe, throw in all the special effects you can imagine and volia: Avengers-Infinity War is there.
What a waste of time and what a waste of potential.
Hopefully the next Marvel-movie will be a stand-alone again with only one or two Marvel-heroes in it because they now go the wrong way.",5,4,7,11 September 2018
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Nonsense movie without the witty Jack
","The other Pirate-movies were not really good movies but nice to watch due to the special-effects and the funny Johnny Depp as Jack. In this movie it is all about a dead captain who lost his ship, crew and life due to a special ship's manoeuvre initiated by Jack. A very stupid story, even for the Pirates-movies, without any logic and also no suspense. Jack is not very funny but most of the time drunk and easily trades his special compass for a bottle of booze. If you have nothing to do watch this movie at home with some beers so the nonsense of this movie won't bother you too much.",5,4,6,17 June 2017
Joker," Slow and uninteresting movie
","I like the Batman-movies und am familiar with the Joker.
But this long movie about the development of his character is not very interesting although the performance of J. Phoenix is outstanding.
But this can not save the movie from not being very entertaining nor interesting and is way too long.
I really do NOT understand the high rating on imdb.com as this is movie is a story of a twisted mind of a strange person with serious problems.
And a lot of the scenes should have been deleted or shortened whioch would have made the movie a bit better.
No, there are other much better movies und dear movie-viewers who give very high ratings: make up your own mind and do not follow the crowd who is yelling that this movie is great.
Because it is definetely NOT!!!",5,0,3,22 December 2019
Wonder Woman," Even for a Marvel-movie very stupid
",I do like Spiderman (a teen been bitten by a radio-active spider thus getting his powers) or Iron Man but this Wonder Woman is even for a Marvel-based movie very stupid. The special effects and the action makes it more or less watchable but the story is unbelievable stupid nonsense with a pretty stupid wonder woman. How the hell do you come up with 141 minutes of absolutely nonsense and this is even for a child a far-fetched movie. Most of the times I conclude with the opinion of the voters on IMDb.com but in this case I probably watched a different movie as it is really a mystery to me that this crappy movie gets a 7.7.... Watch it if you want 141 minutes of nonsense with nice special effects but for Pete's sake do not spent any money on this monstrosity!,5,1,11,12 September 2017
Flight," Very unrealistic
",This is a very unrealistic movie concerning the aviation part as well as the alcoholic part. If something is wrong with the aircraft-stabilizer and you can not control the pitch-attitude you will never be able to control the pitch all of a sudden when you fly upside down. And a drunk pilot is flying better than a healthy and fit pilot trying to do the same thing in the simulator? Also: if you'r a strong alcoholic as this pilot you will never be able to leave the booze alone for 9 days without any help. And during the final hearing he only has to respond 'yes' to get off the hook. How many people would do/say the same thing as he does? But besides this all the movie is slow and boring. Only the first 15 minutes are interesting (the crash) and the minutes of the NTSB-hearing. The whole dramatic middle-part could have been shortened by the half to make this movie at least not as slow as it is now. A disappointing movie and almost a waste of the time watching it.,5,1,1,10 February 2013
John Wick: Chapter 2," Wick is Superman
","The first John Wick was not very bad although the action was also exaggerated but this sequel is in fact a stupid movie. All trained killers are no match for the Superman John Wick who is not only unstoppable but also impossible to kill. The story is also as stupid as the action is: why kill the nice looking sister of d'Antonio and not this asshole instead? Now Wick has to kill first the whole army of the sister and after that the whole army of d'Antonio.... OK, the action is 'entertaining' as you look it as all being possible and do not question the events and action. But if an army has one super-soldier like John Wick they do not need tanks, airplanes and soldiers anymore... So, this movie is very unrealistic, as most of the Hollywoord-movies are, but it is in fact not only a stupid movie but also annoying. If you believe for instance that meat is made in a factory than you probably will like this movie. If not, do not watch it as it is a waste of time (and money if you go to the cinema).",5,1,4,26 May 2017
Alien: Covenant," Superfluous and stupid alien-movie
","I saw the original Alien-movie in the cinema in 1979. Evrybody was shocked by the scene where the alien came out the body of one of the crew-members. Alien was original, terrifying, exciting and with a good story. Alien Covenant is just the opposite and is a movie which should not have been made. It is completely superfluous. Not exciting, terrifying and/or original but in fact a bit annoying and stupid. This whole Walter/David-absurdity is annoying and there are a lot of flaws in the 'story'. If you have not seen Alien 1979 than I suggest you watch that brilliant movie and forget about the Covenant-thing and for you who have seen the original Alien: save yourself the time and do not watch the superfluous and stupid Alien Covenant.",5,2,4,3 July 2017
