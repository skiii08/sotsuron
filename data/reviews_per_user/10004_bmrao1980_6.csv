Sucker Punch," Ended a bit too soon for me :(
","When I was fresh out of the movie hall after watching this one (and it has only been a couple hours since then), I wanted to go right back in!Watching this movie, I already guessed what the critics would be saying. Something along the lines of a genre mash-up served for drooling fan-boys, and all visual and no storyline, and average acting that depends a lot on the technical superiority, and on and on and on. But somehow, it doesn't matter! Yes, the story could have been a little better explained - like how an insane asylum suddenly becomes a 'gentlemen's club', and why is it that we never get to see the awesome dance that Babydoll performs in her trance-like state which seems to mesmerize everyone. But, as I said, it doesn't matter!I had the misfortune of reading one critic's comments before posting this review where he opined that this movie will make sure that Zack Snyder never gets a free-rein to make what he wants ever again. I do not agree with it mostly because this movie proves that Zack can direct almost anything that appeals to the taste of modern young movie audiences. This is his canvas and he proved that he can make anything look good. He hasn't handled the touchy-feely emotional part of this movie very well, but for me, as I am sure for many, it hardly matters.My only true gripe with the movie is that it ended too soon. The final few minutes felt rushed. I was hoping for more dream-sequences and more action during the final moments. But I also feel that the movie studio had some say in the theatrical cut and that a Director's cut would make things much much more fun.I leave here being satisfied that this world will see a lot more awe-inspiring stuff from Zack for many years to come!",9,5,13,25 March 2011
Source Code," Probably won't start a franchise, but will be remembered.
","This movie has everything that one loves and expects from a good enjoyable movie.In all the departments, whether it is acting, casting, story, editing, or visuals, this one delivers. I loved the concept of the movie, no matter how improbable it was. All through the movie I kept thinking how it was possible to make up an entire alternate universe from 8 minutes of memory synapses of a school teacher. Most of the time this would be a turn-off and will go against the movie, but it is handled in such a fashion that I was willing to suspend disbelief and incredulity and just enjoy the film. Because every time I questioned the movie, I also asked the question, 'Ok, fine, but I ma willing to see what happens next.' It is a rare thing for a film-maker to be able to do this, especially since this is not a hardcore action movie.The ending could have been handled better, and was a bit disappointing because the protagonist, who wants to die in 'this' universe, does not instruct the lady Captain to take him off life support in the 'other' universe. but at the same time the message that he does send her is appropriate. Everyone needs to hear 'It is going to be okay.', especially when one is in the same situation as the protagonist.Some of the people who watched the movie with me were of the opinion that JG's acting was a bit wooden, but to be honest, it fit in well with the mood and pacing of the movie. This is not a bang-slash movie. This is a thinker's movie, so to speak.I put this movie in the same category as Constantine - movies that are slow, steady, gripping and stylistic. I loved Constantine & I love this one!",7,0,1,7 June 2011
Resident Evil: Afterlife," Does little more than exploit the new 3D scene.
","I can understand why the critics hate it. I can also understand why fans of the game would love it. But, i am at a loss as to what someone who isn't an avid gamer would make of this movie. For such a person (me), even if the person has followed the movie franchise to its fourth iteration, this movie was pointless in terms of taking the story forward.It seems to me that all of the movie-maker's attention was on the 3D technology rather than anything resembling a plot, storyline, pace, acting, etc. Even the zombies took a backstage here.What i liked about the first three movies was all absent here. Sure, we got to see the freeze-frame, slow-mo action bits, and they were no doubt awesome when seen in 3D. Like the freeze-frame when Alice has just lost her superhuman powers and her plane is about to crash. The detail was astounding and what a suspense it built - i almost broke into a sweat thinking how awesome it would be to see the remainder of the impact in full 3D slow-mo. But then i was presented a scene where the 'human' Alice walks out of such a horrendous plane crash.Then there is the scene where a few survivors are holed up in a prison complex. And surrounding the prison, waving their arms through the fence are the zombies - just like the previous RE-Extinction movie.And on the point of the zombies, what escapes me is why they were reduced to mere background noise! What bothers me is why they did not even act like zombies. First, they bore through the sewers in order to reach the humans inside. They also launch a stealth-attack on the people who go down to the armory to retrieve weapons. This shows active thinking, which they shouldn't be capable of doing. Second, they looked like the same make-up team from MJ's Thriller video was employed. Third, they ran and attacked like humans - this was quite obvious in the scene on the prison rooftop.The biggest sin though was the way the Axeman character was handled. Why was he there? How did he get to be what he is (all the monsters introduced in the previous movies have had their origin explained)? Why did he decide to break down the prison gate? And why on earth was he so easily defeated? Now, in spite of all these and more flaws, if the pace was good enough (outside the freeze-frames and slow-mo) and the time-lines and dialog made sense, and the 'big reveal' handled better, then this would have been a much better movie. Unfortunately, it fails there too.This movie ought to be taken as a lesson in the pitfalls of 3D. This is what happens when the movie-makers concentrate only on the technology they are using and ditch everything else.Still, made me await even more 3D movies. They are surely the future.",3,17,37,13 September 2010
Knowing," Wow!...but not in a good way!
","The start is slow and steady, and gripping, and sets the mood for what i expected to be a gradual increase in the intensity of events, and the characters' reaction to it....and all i did was wait and wait and then the credits rolled. Wow! Watching this movie unfold (oh-so-slowly), and watching the plot(-holes) twist and turn, it just feels like a Film-Making 101 class was given a rare opportunity based on a promising premise...they were to make a disaster movie that incorporated science, religion, maths and paranormal activity, and they had to make sure there is no sequel possible (thankfully).The beginning reminded me of the 'X-files', the end reminded me of M.Night Shymalan, and the music towards the end is taken from, and used to the same effect as, 'Irreversible'. The movie skips genres like they were lotus leafs in a pond, and in doing so leaves plot-holes the size of oceans. This one falls flat - road-kill flat. And i thought 'Next' was bad! I have always considered Nic Cage as a good actor but with the kinda roles he has been doing lately, he is wearing thin on me.",2,6,13,13 November 2009
2012," The worst of all end-of-the-world movies so far!
","The only bit of true acting is by Woody Harrelson. The rest of a very talented cast are just slaves to the green-screen and it shows.The story progresses at a nice pace up until woody harrelson exits the movie (and the destruction begins), and after that it is nothing but one 'huh...wtf!?' event after another. The vague attempts at humor, personal tragedy and emotions, or a humanitarian message all fall flat.And truth be told, the effects are not so good either, even if compared to Roland's own movies like independence day. And these movies are usually all about the effects! It is one thing to exaggerate and accelerate the progress of natural calamities to fit within the limited time of a movie and to keep the pace intact, but another thing altogether to insult the viewer's intelligence by random meaningless important-sounding dialogue and events just for the sake of it. And that's exactly what this movie does.",1,6,8,4 December 2009
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," WTF was Bay thinking
","2 Hasbro releases this summer (both of which i saw on DVD)...well, to sum up: i am glad i didn't shell out bucks to see this one on the big screen.If ever there is an example to be had of wasteful use of technology, this movie is right up there with Battlefield Earth. WTF did i just waste 2.5 hours of my life on!!?I saw this movie and saw alien robot farts, alien robot balls (as in the male body part, complete with jingling and jangling), illiterate alien robots, and thought (the clich√©), Now i have seen everything! There is no semblance of a story, the dialogues make no sense, the editing is choppy at best, the effects are inconsistent, there is no continuity, the plot holes are bigger and deeper than lunar craters, and the new additions to the robot characters either do nothing to add to the storyline or take away from it.Seeing this movie, i think the franchise is going down the same path that the original Batman movie franchise (before Nolan revived it with Batman begins, and we all say thankya!) Shia's acting is the only saving grace of this movie, which should have been aptly titled 'Ressurection of Optimus Prime' because that is what MOST of the movie is all about!!",3,1,6,9 November 2009
