The Mask," Sssssmokin'!
","Classic of classics. Without a doubt, one of the best comedies of all times. It's a complete movie. The script is fabulous and the management even better. Chuck Russell in his best work gives us a series of unforgettable scenes, it would be impossible to choose one, but among the best could mention: the artistic number of the character of Cameron Diaz in Coco Bongo in the style of Rita Hayworth in 'Gilda', scene of theft In the bank and the scene in which the Mask gives its deserved to punk-dressed criminals.With regard to the cast, all of them showed off, from the protagonists to the secondary characters. Jim Carrey (The Mask) in his best performance in a comic film, with every gesture, every nonsense, every madness, robs us of laughter from beginning to end. Cameron Diaz (Tina) impeccable in her debut as actress, wasting sensuality and sweetness at the same time, thanks to that majestic body, that blond hair and sky-blue eyes. Peter Greene perfect as a villain, just by looking at that good face and those deep blue eyes and you know who the bad guy is. The cops very awesome, as always the clever (Peter Riegert) and the clumsy (Jim Doughan). And last but not least, I do not know what it's called the dog that made Milo, but what a bonanza, by God, stole the show that little son of a female dog.As a curious fact, the film is based on the eponymous comic. Yes, nobody or almost nobody knows that. But since the film was filmed and because of its wide acceptance by the public, the comic came out of anonymity, one way or another. To finish, in one of the deliveries of the comic, The Mask shares chapters nothing less with the Joker and Batman.",10,7,7,5 May 2017
Saturday Night Fever," Brilliant
","I didn't live the time when SNF has premiered; but this movie fascinates me, from the first time I saw it when I was 5 or 6 years old in TV, and this fascinated me, and years after, I danced like Travolta in a performance in the elementary school; it has something that makes me enjoy it in a different way, it has everything, it's interesting, entertaining, exciting and it's definitely a very would.One of the things that fascinates me about this great movie is its music, I love the music of the Bee Gees and since I saw Tony Manero walking with the paint pot I got hooked with the character.The scenes on the dance floor are spectacular, each one seems iconic and not only the scenes in the club are good, the background story or above is just as good, it's interesting, you can see the evolution of John Travolta's character and the life he has.Here they show with great success the life and behavior of many adolescents of that time and some of the consequences that will occur if they continue with that lifestyle I have immaturity.In short, a very complete film, very serious and a classic of the 70s.",10,2,4,18 May 2018
Angels & Demons," Don't judge a book by their cover
","The friend Dan Brown lined up with his poor novel 'The Da Vinci Code' and to the heat of his success we got his second work 'Angels and Demons' in which repeats scheme, style and philosophy, and as we all know, despite To be earlier than the first, became popular after this. Although there are those who think that the latter is better, I had enough to sink the archetypal code. So I can say nothing about the virtues of the text on the film or viceversa. What I do affirm is that what we have seen does not pass from a rather fancy gymkhana in which the tracks follow one another as a clumsy excuse to advance the plot. At first glance it may seem ingenious but if you look closely is a jumble without ton or are in which one does not find out anything. I really barely understood Robert Langdon's (Tom Hanks) deductions, or what led him to go from one side of Rome to another. A lot runs, I run you, fairly forced but little more.Having said that however confusing the details of the investigation, what is the plot I call the first. The bad, the plans, what's behind the Illuminati. Everything, except some points of the plot that neither Ron Howard nor Down Brown could solve. And it is not to put medals but the progressive minds of these creators are simpler than they are totally useless and all the clichés that introduce are come to the league, at least for which it has some sense of smell for these cases. With this the film is not that surprising, nor that arouses much interest. To tell you that he was more concerned if Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer, from Italian and Catholic, nothing, Jewish from Israel) wore shoes or boots (yes, fortunately they were the latter) I tell you everything. Of course, the scenes that are sprinkled 'Angels and Demons' between ridiculous and laughable, entertain and allow you to laugh at your expense for how bad they are.Special mention deserves the philosophy of this novel led to the big screen. On the one hand, its success, like that of the 'Da Vinci Code', lies in a certain Manichaean and progressive vision that gives a historical pedigree to this leftist position. Light fighting against the reaction for centuries and even millennia. How cool! In this vision, the Catholic Church is the perfect target as an obscurantist institution par excellence. The fact that this approach is a bundle of delirious and pamplained memes without any historical background is the least of it. But on the other, there is a positive vision that encourages the very Church that is attacked so that steps towards a kind of harakiri in which they end up dissolving all their dogmas and beliefs. Here is insisted on the mantra of combining religion and science, as Benedict XVI says, Reason and Faith. What they do not understand, not even the Pope, is that reason and science directly destroy the Faith and what is the Own religion as we know it. I understand that an atheist does not care, but he who writes annoys this tricky philosophy as determined to rationalize religion as to end all the magic, the sacred and the supernatural that every creed defends.",3,0,2,7 August 2017
The Longest Yard," Powerful machine!
","For those who like American football and absurd comedies, this can be a drinking option.The tape seeks at all times the entertainment and the fun with situations full of tolerable and sympathetic ridicule, where the pursuit of the claim in the pride and the value of playing for the ideals in spite of the consequences are the strongest subjects that are developed in the speech. Thus, a group of convicts will be able to take revenge of the abuses committed by the guard-prisons in a game of football. Although the circumstances deviate from common sense and do not cause the laughter, they become dynamic and keep hooked to that spectator without so many pretensions in the elaboration of the argument.From the performances we have what we can expect a priori: Adam Sandler and Chris Rock in their conventional comic roles. They do not leave even a single moment of what they know how to do better: light characters but with a lot of charisma. Also it is necessary to mention that Burt Reynolds hardly obtains a discreet personage, although its interpretation brings the unique hint of sobriety before so much dizzy chatter.From the aesthetic and technical section we have a film full of sequences in slow motion to give showdown to the spectacular and action that becomes a contact sport. This is accompanied by familiar musical themes that further promote and accentuate the dynamic character of the film.In short, an acceptable and jovial alternative if one can deviate from prejudices and accept in advance that the film is a hobby lacking in presumption.",5,1,1,7 September 2017
Spider-Man 2," Better than the first
","Spider-Man 2 is that extremely rare gem that manages to exceed the high qualities of its predecessor in every way.Tobey Maguire reprises his role and maintains to present the perfect portrayal of Peter Parker. While struggling with real life and his heroic life, Parker's growing love for Mary Jane grows and flawlessly creates a strong emotional trend to this film. Alfred Molina gives audiences one of the strongest performances with a Marvel villain through his role as the notorious Doctor Octopus. From a potent script and incredible visual effects (more practical then CGI), Sam Raimi succeeds in creating an intimidating foe who is both interesting and sophisticated. Without a doubt one of the very best Marvel films to come out is cemented as my most favored superhero film of all time.",7,0,4,12 June 2017
Batman Returns," Dark Knight is back
","Once again, the performance of the villain is superior to Michael Keaton's moderate portrayal of Batman. This time, our main foe is the Penguin, played by none other than Danny Devito. His performance makes him almost as sophisticated and disturbing as Nicholson's Joker. With Christopher Walken as a supporting role, it makes it seem that this is a superb sequel. However, I felt that Michelle Pfeiffer's performance as Catwoman was more focused on being seductive, rather being a clever feline thief. Overall, it doesn't feel superior to the predecessor, but remains as entertaining.",8,1,11,12 July 2017
The Mummy," Action-packed adventure film
","I remember being terrified when I first watched this when I was just a kid. As I've grown up, there are still a couple of things, mainly the scarabs, that make me cringe. The use of Egypt mythology was a strong point of this film as it includes Egyptian gods, curses and even some of the 10 plagues of Egypt. I admired the performances of both Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz, especially how their relationship develops over the course of the story. The supporting roles from John Hannah, Kevin J.O Connor and Oded Fehr were also highlights as their performances very easily stood out, just like the main characters. However, for me, Arnold Vosloo's role as the cursed Imhotep was the spotlight of the film as his performance alone created a strong sense of horror and power. Even though there were a couple of good laughs, I felt that this film could've been better without attempting to be funny. Overall, The Mummy is one of my personal favorite Universal films to come out within the last 14 years and I feel tops off anything that the later sequels can give to the audience.",10,1,2,14 May 2017
Dead Poets Society," Carpe Diem
","'The Dead Poets Club' is one of the films that have marked me the most in my life, in the sense that it presents a philosophy and a way of understanding human existence, which I think we should all follow at the foot of the letter. The character who so masterfully represents Robin Williams, offers us the guidelines and the keys to a full development and a vision of life, where there always reigns optimism, joy, good humor and honorability. Take advantage of the moment, do not get tired of repeating the teacher protagonist and that is what we should do at all times, stay with the good and discard the bad, not give up, fight for the ideals and at the end of everything, when the days are we can exhaust ourselves, be able to look back and think calmly, that truly, our passage through this world left some trace, since we took the opportunity to live. It is worth trying to be happy in this valley of tears. A work of art in short and a real wonder from all points of view, so if there is still someone who has not seen it, it is taking too long. Carpe Diem, comrades!",10,0,0,29 September 2017
Home Alone," This is my house, and I must defend it
","It is recommended because it is excellent, because it has excellent history, excellent script and is a movie for the whole family and because the performances are the best of all. Excellent Christmas movie and masterpiece by Chris Columbus.Excellent movie, I loved the performance of Macaulay Culkin the best, Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern also, the best performance of all, I wonder what happened to Macaulay Culkin ? Home Alone is a movie to see as a family, a movie to watch at Christmas. I loved. 10 points. And the man with the excellent shovel. As I said the best performance of all, the part that Kevin puts the tarantula to the thief Marv (Daniel Stern) killed me with laughter and the face that Joe Pesci puts on when he leaves in the police car made me laugh. Safety pin. Very recommended. I suppose everyone saw it, the one who did not see it, I recommend it, you can see it. It is a film suitable for all audiences. The McCalister family goes on vacation to France, they leave Kevin (Macaulay Culkin) alone at home, Kevin learns to fend for himself and even protect himself, cheat him and confront some thieves who come to Harry's house (Joe Pesci) and Marv (Daniel Stern) are two thieves who intend to raid all the closed houses in their neighborhood. When his mother realizes that he forgot about him, he makes a trip back to Chicago to recover his son. It's fun, entertaining, comical, dramatic and also for the Christmas season.",10,3,5,12 November 2017
Terminator Salvation," Frankenstein
","With the thunderous premiere of Terminator 5 two years ago, I decided to embark on a summer sit-down action, temporary trips and murderous robots.Watching the five films, I proceed to issue a verdict on this saga: it is definitely dead in the strictly artistic speaking. Without its original creator (James Cameron) each new entry has been digging a pit even deeper. And right now it's a franchise prostituted to the extreme. Even Cameron himself had to resort to Terminator 2 to save his ass against the failure of 'Abyss' (1989).Terminator Salvation is not a bad movie, in fact. Has very well focused parts and overwhelming scenes. It only has one glue ... That has nothing to do with the atmosphere and tone of the first two deliveries. There is too much light here, the T-600 is in short supply, and the massive battles between humans and cyborgs, (as in the flashbacks of the first and second films) are of cardboard: too much light for a postapocalyptic story. It ends up being a kind of western mixed with Matrix, War of the Worlds and Transformers. Desert, desert and more desert. Nothing of cities annihilated with tons of skeletons and gigantic machines lurking the battlefield to the few humans who dare to face them.This film was conceived to finish to throw to a lousy actor, (Sam Worthington) and to give bait to a Christian Bale that does not strike like John Connor. In itself, this movie is not Terminator. If it was conceived as an independent film and with its own personality, I would consider it a good movie. But Terminator only has the title. The BSO, composed by Danny Elfman is horrible, nothing to do with the Brad Friedel classic.In short, a pity. It will remain as a rarity more within the Frankenstein that is in itself the whole saga.-Terminator 1: the best of all. With few means, an immediate classic was achieved. -Terminator 2: Great movie, superlative level but below the first delivery. -Teminator 3: Gar-bage. It brings nothing and is a decaffeinated reheat of the second delivery. -Terminator 4: Is this Terminator? -Terminator 5: for some abhorrent, for others, without being a wonder at least retrieved something from the original Temrinator.",2,0,3,31 July 2017
Spider-Man 3," The curse of the years ending with '7' of the superhero films
","Watching 'Spider-man 3' has come to mind a contest I particularly liked, the weakest rival. More than anything because with this film could be organized a similar contest, but would be called the strongest rival. It would gain who could take more time viewing this infection without leaving the room.The film is clearly divided into two very differentiated parts; A first half boring, dull and with an argument more proper of a soap opera than a Marvel comic. The second half is directly an insult, an unworthy, soulless and unbearable garbage.At the same height as Sidney Furie's 'Superman IV: The Quest of Peace' (1987) and Joel Schumacher's 'Batman & Robin' (1997), Sam Raimi is dedicated to giving us a script that kicks up to the balls the original Spider- man comic and that reduces the characters to simple puppet theaters of themselves. There are times when I have come to ask if it was not before a gross parody, because what I saw could not really be serious.If the script is bad, it is also possible to speak about performance and direction. From the first it all boils down to the following: many characters, little history, little psychological depth and the end result: insensitive performances at best (James Franco), mostly inconsequential (Thomas Haden Church, Topher Grace, James Cromwell, Bryce Dallas Howard) and wicked in the couple protagonist. From the direction, nothing at all, camera movements at all rags, a lot of video clip, paste some American flags that are always grateful and waste millions of dollars in digital effects copied from 'The Mummy'.In short, a debacle in the whole rule. Not that the previous deliveries were wonderful, but they maintained a certain dignity, characteristic that Sam Raimi has lost in filming this, and still to continue charging. If he had a modicum of decency, he should retire from the cinema, only to not continue to offend his own legacy and above all because of the offense that has caused Spider-Man fans.The best: Now 'The Ghost Rider' seems to me in comparison, a masterpiece. The worst: So much promotion for this? Shame!",1,1,3,9 July 2017
The Terminator," A big masterpiece of the sci-fi genre
","A masterful science-fiction thriller and action directed by great novice James Cameron (formerly directed only 'Piranha 2') and starring the great Arnold Schwarzenegger in what was possibly the role of his life, it is simply magnificent as the Killing machine whose name gives title to the film. There are also great Mike Biehn (regular in Cameron's films), Linda Hamilton (this was his 6th film), Lance Henriksen ('Aliens'' robot Bishop) and Paul Winfield (the judge in 'Presumed Innocent').An unknown Bill Paxton plays a small role as the Punk leader who dies at the hands of the T-800. This was his first collaboration with Jim Cameron, later he would make 4 more films with him.Also noteworthy are the special effects of Stan Winston and Gene Warren of Fantasy II, especially the endoskeleton (the Terminator without skin). The movie would have lost a lot if it had not shown the endoskeleton, it was the final surprise that Cameron had prepared.It was obvious that the Terminator had to be shown without the living tissue, since the great majority of the public was very curious and hoped to see what was inside Schwarzenegger, especially when one sees the 'operation' of the eye and arm, the public I knew Arnold had 'something' and wanted to see it.Also noteworthy are the excellent soundtrack of Brad Friedel, as well as some eighties songs from TryangleZ ('Photoplay' or 'Burnin' in the Third Degree') or Lin Van Hek ('Intimacy').The movie is very, very entertaining from beginning to end, an undisputed masterpiece of science fiction that must be seen (if not 100, 100,000 times) before dying.It followed an excellent continuation (T2: judgment day) with a less convincing Terminator, but with some incredible special effects and the ridiculous Terminator 3: rise of the machines, with an aging Schwarzenegger.Terminator is UNIQUE.I thank God that I am alive so I can see this movie again. I can not get enough of seeing her, it's impossible.A DESERVED 10.",10,1,3,14 July 2017
Rocky II," Pretty similar to the first one, but it maintains the quality very well
","Although the decline is noticeable and in the background the plot is like the first film, but with another ending (which from the first one of his achievements seemed to me that) is developed in a slightly different way so that it is saved If it doesn't look like a 'autoplagium', some characters evolve, especially I would highlight Mickey and Apollo, which for me are the sauce of this movie, one for asking Rocky to take this fight much more seriously and Apollo, because no He wants to win, he wants to convince.In the case of Adrian, Paulie and Rocky are more or less in the same line, which has merit being three characters that are not stereotypes at all. There are small errors, such as the impact of the first film is already lost or there are some scenes that have extended more than the account, such as when Rocky works on something he does not like and we see him doing the same things.Anyway it is a more than worthy sequel, and if you have wanted more with the first installment you will like how continuity is respected.",8,1,1,14 August 2019
Forrest Gump," Excellent!!
","Converted into a classic of the 90's and for me in a classic of all time, Forrest Gump is a story that marvels, excites, amuses all types of public. It tells the story of the United States through a poor backward named Forrest who is involved in the great events that have occurred in the 'country of opportunity', with a realistic look at the Vietnam War and other more fantastic ones such as The birth of large companies (such as Apple). But what most envelops me is the background story of love, with an almost unreachable Jenny, which keeps the viewer on the verge of tears in several scenes. (Exciting when he asks for marriage) Notable performances, Hanks was born for this role, great is Gary Sinise as Lieutenant Dan, plus special effects first hand, necessary to be able to tell us the dynamic and fun story of North America seen through Forrest's eyes. There are phrases that are immortalized such as 'Run Forrest, Run !!!!' Or 'Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're going to play ..', make this movie a masterpiece of cinema of all time.",10,1,2,5 May 2017
Predator," Schwarzenegger vs. Predator
","A corny if effectively made poor-man's 'Alien' concerning a group of soldiers (led by Arnold Schwarzenegger) who are sent in on a rescue mission, only to find that they have been lied too by the government and in amongst the Central American forests lie a creature that is intent on stalking them and killing them one by one. As said, this film is really, really corny, with a predictable-enough storyline of each of these soldiers being picked off one by one by the monster as if in some teen horror flick. However, with that said, this does not mean that it is not ferociously entertaining, due to crowd-pleasing talents like Arnold and Carl Weathers taking up a large chunk of the screen-time. The final showdown between Arnold and the Predator brings the goods and some, where director John McTiernan is allowed to flex his muscle and skill in ratcheting up the suspense. The special effects have also aged extremely well, and the introduction of the creature, being that we only see his point of view through heat sensors, is a nice choice. Enjoyable, tightly paced, beautifully photographed, and fun to watch, somehow, despite being ridiculous and lacking in character development to a large extent, 'Predator' still gets it done.",9,1,2,21 July 2017
The Last Legion," 5 Passable - Paranormal Event
","The movie moves us to the year 476, the beginning of the dark years and the end of the Old Age. A historical and interesting event with little protagonism in the cinema. Do not expect history lessons. Nor is it fundamental because the vast majority of works in this genre pass the historical fact as far as I know, and yet almost all are entertained. But .... What problem has the cinema with the Goths and in general with all the peoples called barbarians ?. I suppose until they prove that there were also gay hot springs in Germania we will always be offered so rough. The last legion is bad with balls, a rehash of Braveheart, Gladiator and Lord of the rings. Many of the actors feel sorry and the only one with name (Ben Kingsley) interprets to an old flamenco dancer. Action scents distil scent of cardboard. The whole part in the castle of Capri is to start trembling, and eye that is the longest. Already in the final part I believe to have seen actors in plane laughing at the shame of others that transmitted the speech to William Wallace before the battle. The evil of the mask is a mad man, and the final battle is an anticlimax. I do not find anything positive and what I do not understand after all this, is that it has become very short and I have seen it without any pause, so I put a 5. What happens to me, doctor?",5,1,4,27 July 2017
Grease," The best musical movie that I ever seen
","I don't know how many times I could have seen 'Grease', but I don't know how many times I'll see it again. And I liked too much this movie, since the time when I performed this musical when I was in the elementary school.Very few are the films that with the viewings don't lose attractiveness and this is the great achievement of this fantastic musical.Starting from a very simple script, we see the typical tough boy, Danny Zuko, (played masterfully by John Travolta) and his problems for combining his fame with his love for Sandy (played masterfully by the adorable Olivia Newton-John), with an agile rhythm, fun, unpretentious and really enjoyable.A funny side where I would highlight Rizzo and an unforgettable soundtrack, which I still hear on weekends in many clubs have made this movie a classic, never surpassed by a movie of the style and that didn't deserve that second part.",10,3,3,6 August 2018
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," The black sheep of the Terminator saga
","I'm not going to talk about the casting mistakes (where are you, Edward Furlong and Linda Hamilton?) Or that Terminatrix that looks like something from 'Species' (that horror of the name of Terminatrix, by the way ... Porn movies). No. Nor will I talk about how the heck Skynet is created without Cyberdine or Dyson. And I'll spare the character of Claire Danes.What I am going to talk about is the lack of spiritual coherence with the rest of the saga.In 'T-2' was mentioned the phrase 'there is no destiny, only the one that we do'. The definition of free will, come on. But what does John Connor discover in 'T-3'? That the Final Judge was inevitable. Like Neo of the saga 'Matrix', Connor becomes a pawn that never had opportunity to change history.And that makes 'T-3' a Greek movie ('Gods handle our lives and mortals are mere puppets') as opposed to the biblical / Christian approach to 'the world is like you do' of the previous ones.And I give a five to the movie because Arnie, his character and his lapidary phrases are still the same.",3,0,6,12 July 2017
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Greatest movie of all time
","One of the most intelligent, imaginative and riveting sci-fi, action flicks to hit the screens ever, 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day' is a classic without equal. What's even more surprising is that 'T2' is a sequel of an already great film. 1984's 'The Terminator' was an interesting premise that Cameron pulled off ably and catapulted Arnold Schwarzenegger to the stratosphere of movie stardom. 'T2' has brains to spare to go with the action and there's a lot to like. The movie banks on the insight that humans are more destructive to the world than any machine can be. Linda Hamilton's amped-up Sarah Connor is the real emotional machine in 'T2' unable to see beyond the mission of saving her son for the sake of a doomed humanity. She has such little faith in humankind that her actions become robotic. The performances are top-notch. This is Schwarzenegger's key role and Hamilton has never been better. Robert Patrick's steely performance is incredibly menacing and Edward Furlong is innocent yet with strong conviction. 'T2' was well ahead of its time with its digital effects and it uses them magnificently. There's nothing not to like about 'T2', it's loaded with imagination, thrills and action.",10,1,3,12 July 2017
Spider-Man," A strong Marvel entry
","One of Marvel's flagship characters finally makes it to the big screen and with Sam Raimi at the helm, you have a sure-fire winner. The first half of the film is as expected, fantastic. It has just the right balance of humour and action and although Tobey Maguire's acting talents are rather limited, he manages to pull off the dorky charm of Peter Parker with some success. There's a lot of humour in the discovery of his powers and how to use them and the supporting characters are all believable. It also shows the motivations and character development of Spiderman really well and rarely descends into schmaltz. Unfortunately once the tights go on, things are not quite as strong. The Green Goblin was never a particularly interesting character and although the schizophrenia plot line is clever, Defoe holds the attention far more as the disappointed father than a dayglo action figure on a hover board. Raimi handles the action nicely though and it's worth it alone for J. K. Simmons whose hilarious J. Jonah Jameson steals every scene he is in.",6,0,1,12 June 2017
Die Hard 2," Great second part
","'Die Hard 2' is the first of 4 sequels to the amazing 'Die Hard'. This is pretty much the first movie, only on a plane. Terrorists have taken over an airport in an attempt to get a Latin American dictator and drug lord named Ramón Esperanza (a mix between the Panama's dictator Manuel Noriega and Colombia's drug lord Pablo Escobar) who is being transported there free. But, John McClane happens to be at the airport because his wife is flying in. She can't land because the terrorist group have made it so planes can't see the runway, so her plane is running out of fuel, and it's a race for McClane to stop them and get Holly (his wife) down safely. This is the one I have seen the least, and when watching at the marathon, it was like a whole new movie because I forgot so much. It's very exciting and has some great action, and begins the series ascend to get crazier and crazier with their action pieces. I mean he fights on the wing of a plane that is about to fly. Insane? Yup. Entertaining? Your damn right! Great sequel and the last appearance of his wife Holly, but a great way to keep the series going.",8,2,3,21 July 2017
Independence Day," In the name of the Mankind
","One of the most criticized movies that I remember, and for a large sector that far from seeing its true pretensions, which are none other than those of a pure and carefree entertainment judge for their patriotic messages. They can not argue otherwise than the worn and boring speech 'Americanized', the same ones who do not mind that concept when they come out of films like 'Save Private Ryan', 'Flags of Our Fathers' and many others that according to the director the same message seems to be forgotten, when dealing with more serious issues should be more objective.
In any case Roland Emmerich, he goes through the lining (fortunately) the opinion of critics and is limited to perform the kind of show that he would like to see in a movie theater. For 'Independence Day', he does not hesitate to take references such as 'The War of the Worlds' or 'Star Wars' as well as the cinema of catastrophes of the 70's, recycling what was the day of its premiere a spectacular production with extraordinary visual effects, which combine exemplary models and digitalisations with a result of reference. The story is not new, but if it is, the dialogues are not Shakespeare's, but who cares? when it comes to spending two hours of pure action in which there is hardly room for absurd ramblings. It is therefore an easy target for those who believe themselves to be scholars and try to make those who enjoy this type of products complacent, who at least have a clear objective, to collect and entertain. I certainly had a great time and fully enjoyed this excellent science fiction film, to 'Hamlet' we will leave for another day.",10,2,4,4 January 2018
Mamma Mia!," An ABBA renaissance
","To start many people will be amazed with such a high score but once again I can not be objective. The film transmits in an amazing way that joy of the ABBA songs, which without having large lyrics makes them still on the list of best selling albums. The scenarios of the film are wonderful and I have really felt a certain envy for the actors who have received a millionaire for doing something so fun in an incomparable setting. Speaking more about the film I will tell you that Meryl Streep has not let me down at all and that I had some misgivings because I saw her a little bigger for the role. However it does again a fantastic performance. Of the secondary ones I emphasize to a surprising Colin Firth more comical of the accustomed thing. Wonderful and hilarious Julie Walters. Well I encourage you all to see the movie because as I have read here, the fans of ABBA will love you and the others do not think that at least you get bored. The movie that can best define the idea of ​​being on vacation.",10,0,1,20 June 2017
Liar Liar," Nothing Stops the Claw!!
","See it because it is excellent because it is very funny, Jim Carrey makes a lot of laughs, it is very funny and entertaining from the beginning to the end. He has an excellent screenplay and excellent story, Max the son of Reede Fletcher (Jim Carrey) celebrates his birthday and asks for a wish: that his father does not lie for 24 hours, Jim Carrey is a lying father who works as a lawyer.To the negative reviewers of this film, if you do not like Jim Carrey's comedy and it does not make you laugh do not look at his comedies and look at him in the drama, you can look at 'Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind' there is serious or 'The Majestic' sure you should like it. I do not understand how they can speak ill of 'Liar Liar' if it's excellent, not only makes of a liar father but makes of a liar and crazy father who works like lawyer, I die of laughter the funny things that does Jim Carrey in this movie but it's a bit exaggerated like when he hits with the toilet lid in the bathroom and a gentleman who does not understand it looks at him.The ending phrase 'Nothing stops the claw!' It killed me with laughter, it's very funny and entertaining from the beginning until it ends. Jim Carrey in this movie is comical, the bloopers are great and I give him 10 points. It's a masterpiece by Tom Shadyac.",9,0,1,6 May 2017
2012," We were warned
","At this point in history we are not going to discover Roland Emmerich and we are not going to get our hands on the head because of his way of conceiving what they call the seventh art ... but, on the other hand, it is fair to recognize that Emmerich does not deceive absolutely To anyone, that their creations are alarmingly spectacular, and that their products radiate honesty and sincerity as few.With respect to '2012', we can say that this film can be evaluated from two different perspectives: letting ourselves be carried away by the monumental circus of fireworks that is offered to us, or by valuing the film objectively as a mere cinematographic product. In this second case would come very badly, as expected ... then, let's see that offers us as a visual show capable of leaving the mouth open to the viewer.With respect to the above, the goal is more than fulfilled, because if other 'fantastic' films have achieved a level of spectacularity and special effects almost insurmountable, there is no doubt that Emmerich exceeds that quota here, and In addition with much difference. Without going further than reality, the film is a constant roller coaster of incessant spectacle, without limits or concessions. The action scenes and hecatomb are captured on screen with a realism and veracity that, honestly, is not remembered if we look back. The truth is that '2012' is nothing more than a fun 'blockbuster' of escape that does not bore a bit, since we do not give us a second of respite. Each scene is bigger and more surprising than the previous one, and this added to the terrible and deafening rumble that accompanies each and every one of the most striking sequences of the story, turn the tape into a true pyrotechnic 'show' that keeps the viewer with the Eyes like dishes An attraction that does not leave anyone indifferent. '2012' is the 'mother' of all catastrophic genre films,In short: This festival of Roland Emmerich fulfills what it promises: earthquakes devouring whole continents, volcanoes erupting in unison, meteorites destroying everything there and for having, and tsunamis as incredibly shocking as unlikely. So do not look for anything more than an effective entertainment product, because you will not find it. But who wants to see the greatest destruction on a world scale ever told in a movie, this is the perfect product for it. Of course everything depends on the level of tolerance of each viewer.<ul><li>Pros: Their incredible and dazzling scenes of destruction and the amazing special effects!</li></ul><ul><li>Cons: We are not going to complain about the absurdity of his script, the histrionics of some of its sequences, or the simplicity of its development ... but of its certain excess of duration.</li></ul>",6,1,2,13 August 2017
School of Rock," Let's get rocked
","Dewey Finn: Dude, I service society by rocking, OK? I'm out there on the front lines liberating people with my music! 'We don't need no education.' School of Rock has been another go to movie for me for the last 7 or 8 years. For me, this is an easy winner because I am a Jack Black fan and because I love the music their playing. Black is a musician that can hold his own and the kids in the movie are great at their respected instrument. The film is funny, well-written by Mike White, and directed with surprising style by Richard Linklater. Like I said, Black is in the lead and he gives probably the best comedic performance of his life as Dewey Finn. School of Rock follows the misadventures of Dewey. He's a loser who is trying to make it big in the music industry. His band plays small bars and he lives with a friend and his friends girlfriend, mooching of them for rent. Dewey's friend at the request of his girlfriend tells him if he doesn't come up with rent, they are going to kick him out. More bad news comes in the form of Dewey getting kicked out of his band. He tries to rebound with a new band, but finding people isn't easy. When he takes a substitute teaching job, posing as his friend teacher, he meets a group of kids that can rock, and tries to use them to win the Battle of the Bands. This is a different type of movie for Linklater. I guess if you examine his film career, this would tie in most closely with Bad News Bears; except that School of Rock is much, much better. It also rings with great music much like his comedic stoner masterpiece Dazed and Confused did. School of Rock is just plain fun. It's hard not to have a good time watching Jack Black totally embrace a role like this. This is the Jack Black character. He is at his best when he plays himself, and Dewey Finn is just less profane Jack Black from Tenacious D. So seeing him here is just as much fun as watching him in Tenacious D in: The Pick of Destiny. A great, family friendly, music comedy from a great director and a cast of good musicians. The songs are catchy, the jokes funny, and the story clever. Yeah, it follows a pretty basic formula for its success, but you can't sent the luring power of the pit stops White take with his writing. The lessons in class, the lunchroom conversations, and just letting Black perform.",6,1,1,12 June 2017
Shrek the Third," Disappointing
","What made the first Shrek enduring & charming has been completely lost over the course of the sequels, resulting in a lackluster third installment. Animators claims at advanced technology allowing them to produce better imagery & detail is very questionable, as to ask 'so what?'. The film is packed full of load, OTT gags & physical comedy to keep you awake, as well as entertain the kiddies with the bright colors & action - but for a more mature audience at whom the dialogue & jokes of the films are aimed, it neither impresses nor amuses. In fact the characters seem to have taken a step back, becoming more slapstick in their behavior & approach. I can't help but feel that the voice cast realize this, & each deliver a bored & tired performance. The comedy is recycled from it's predecessors, it's direction a mystery, it's intentions non-existent. Dreamworks should have quit whilst it was ahead, & should stop cussing on advertising it's star casts & work more on story & script.",4,0,1,7 August 2017

This truly is a blockbuster that you are into it, you can easily be on the edge of your seat. Never in my life would I have thought I would love watching robots beat the crap out of each other. This is definitely one of the best efforts in bringing an old television cartoon to the big screen, and it does so in great style. Shia LaBeouf leads this movie to stardom, with an exceptional performance, even though his character is a tad annoying at times. Sure there is dumb humor and almost too much action, but that is Michael Bay for you. All in all, it's one of Bay's best!",6,1,2,19 June 2017
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Through the eyes of innocence
","War is said to either bring people together or tear them apart. The movie The Boy in the Striped Pajamas demonstrates both outcomes in a heart wrenching tale about a Nazi soldier's son and his unlikely new companion. The heartbreaking story begins in Berlin, where the son Bruno's life is that of an ordinary eight years old boys. All this will change once his Father asks the family to go with him on his assignment as a soldier during World War II, where the progression of tragedy begins. This tragic story is brought to life through many aspects such as acting, costume, and plot, all of which give the movie great emotional appeal. This movie would not have this great emotional appeal if it were not for the actors. Asa Butterfield brilliantly portraits the son, Bruno. For such a young actor Butterfield shocks his audience with such great expression of emotion. Asa makes his act believable through his facial expressions and delivery of lines. Often when he speaks his voice echoes innocence and when appropriate, confusion. The main physical feature he uses to portray his innocence are his eyes. He often widens them in awe and uses them to connect with the audience by looking either directly in the camera or intently at the other characters. One of those other characters is his father, who is also a Nazi soldier, played by David Thewlis. As the story progresses David smiles less and less showing how the war is beginning to impact his character. He shows little reaction to the cruelty played out in the movie, hardly flinching. This stillness that David brings further portraits his character as a harsh, unforgiving Nazi soldier and starkly contrasts Bruno. There is an even greater contrast seen between the Jewish and German characters in the film. This contrast is emphasized through the characters of Bruno and Schmuel with the use of costume and set. Bruno is a well dressed little boy, surrounded by a well dressed family, in a big beautiful house. While Schmuel, who lives but a mile away, wears rags in a fenced in suffering 'community'. While what they wear sets them apart, what really shows the social divide between the Germans and Jews is the wall around Bruno's home. When first driving up to the house it is evident that what is inside the boundaries of their home is vastly different from what is on the outside of it. This movie does a wonderful job in costume and set, setting up the movie for success in showing the social divide between the Jews and Germans during World War II. Mark Herman, the director has a lot to do with the success of the movie as well. Thanks to him the plot progresses in a way that flows and wastes no scenes. The movie lets you see glimpses into how the war impacted each person's life differently. From the grandparents to Bruno's sister we get a taste of the many different perspectives on the war. While the movie could have expanded on the other character's experiences a bit more, having only a brief look allows for each scene to serve a purpose and avoids filler. Due to that success in plot the movies emotional appeal continues to be its best quality throughout the film. This original idea to show a Nazi soldier's son and an eight years old Jewish prisoner leads the audience to feel great sadness. This sadness is not only drawn from the film but from a real history of hatred towards a people who were not understood. The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is not a movie to be watched purely for entertainment, but also to reflect on the past and on the actions of the Nazi's towards the Jews. That is what brings true greatness to the film not just the acting, progression of plot, and costume, but the historical accurateness.",10,0,0,14 May 2017
Shrek 2," Not a greatest sequel, but entertains
","Although not as original and smart as the first film, Shrek 2 is equally funny and irreverent, introducing new adorable secondary characters in an excellent animation that never ceases to be a lot of fun for both adults and kids. Rarely a CGI-based sequel ever is seen. But Shrek 2 delivers in more ways than one.

Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Not a bad film.
","The visions of Dahl and Burton perfectly complement each other (please see Wes Anderson's Fantastic Mr Fox as a point of direct contrast here) and the film is therefore faithful to the book in a modern transposition (for instance the updating of Violet Beauregarde and Mike Teevee are prefect, and fully faithful to Dahl's characters). It is acerbic, funny, unsettling, with a good fondant centre, immeasurably superior to the Gene Wilde version I grew up with. However, the British accents referring to 'candy' grates massively: please choose one or the other.",5,0,2,25 May 2017
The Mummy Returns," This movie is not bad.
","Even though I enjoyed this film, I felt that it didn't meet or top the original. Mainly, I feel that the film focuses too much on the action rather than the horror that the first one created. However, the action sequences were satisfying, from the bus sequence, to the final battle between the Medjai and the armies of Anubis. Even though Arnold Vosloo still maintains his portrayal of power, he loses some of that original power as the danger and importance of his role is replaced with the race against time to stop the Scorpion King from being awaken. Overall, although I enjoyed most of the performances, like Fraser and Weisz, I feel that while it's enjoyable and is re-watchable, for me, its only the action sequences that make this worth returning to, rather than the characters, horror and the few yet strong battle scenes from the first film.",6,0,0,13 May 2017
Victory," If the wars were defined in a soccer field
","The scarcity of films dealing with football is noteworthy, considering that it is the king of sports, at least in a Europe that is increasingly important when evaluating whether a film ends up being viable or not. The 'Goal' trilogy, 'Kicking & Screaming', 'The Damned United', 'Mean Machine' or 'Bend It Like Beckham' are some of the examples of feature films about soccer. Possibly the most remembered is Victory, which dates back to 1981, one of the last projects of the double Oscar winner, John Huston (1906-1987), one of the best directors in film history ('The Maltese Falcon', 'The African Queen') at a time in his life when he was filming whatever he wanted, hence he dared with the psychological thriller 'Phobia' (1980), the musical 'Annie' (1982), and in between with this light sports tape which worked, unsurprisingly, better in Europe than in the USA.Striking is the cast of 'Victory', it features a budding American star -Sylvester Stallone-, reputed players -Michael Caine, Max Von Sydow - and retired professional soccer players - Pelé (Brazil), Bobby Moore (England), Osvaldo Ardiles (Argentina), Paul Van Himst (Belgium), Kazimierz Deyna (Poland), among others.A Nazi prisoner of war camp, the place where Major Karl Von Steiner (Sydow) arrives, looking at the detail of the prisoners' control of the ball. He has an occurrence as the coach incarnates Michael Caine, a football match between the German national team and a combined ally of players who find themselves as prisoners of war. To the Germans the party serves as propaganda, to the allied selection as a possible escape route. By the way, for those who are interested, Stallone is the goalkeeper of the team.The Great Escape + Rocky + Soccer = Victory. From the first he takes the entire plot and copies the music - from Bill Conti - from the second he has the main actor and an exciting sporting event on which the entire film revolves. The result is a first-rate diversion, a simple story, well told, with a familiar and certainly childish touch - the Nazis are not very bad to say, nor do I know anyone in their right mind who prefers to play the second part of a game football before escaping from a prison camp.The game, which at the end of the day is what justifies the viewing, belongs to those impossible feats in which everything goes against - the result, the referee -, based on overcoming and teamwork to turn the scoreboard and come out as victorious as can be expected. Achieved, vibrant and well captured by the camera, the rest is the technique and talent of Pelé - great! - and company. Of the worst cast, Sylvester Stallone's footballing skills.As a curiosity, although it is more a tragedy, Victory is a real fact that has no happy ending at all like the one on the film, quite the contrary, in 1942 part of the Dynamo Kiev team was executed for not letting themselves win against the German team.",8,0,0,9 April 2020
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," Better than the first
","This film premiered on Friday, November 20, 1992 in the United States, again directing Chris Columbus.Synopsis:The McCallisters prepare to go on vacation to Florida. The day before Kevin has to sing Christmas carols with his school. The whole family attends and an accident occurs...Kevin must apologize to his family, but he does not believe that it was his fault and does not ask for forgiveness. He is punished to sleep in the attic and, when the vans arrive to take them to the airport (this time the McCallister goes to Miami instead of Paris), they have fallen asleep again. They begin the rush and everyone goes to the airport. This is where Kevin gets distracted from his parents and takes a plane to New York. New York also comes the 'Wet Criminals', who have escaped from prison and want to hit a toy store. But they have not counted on Kevin ...Review:Even better than its predecessor! For me, it surpasses much to the first part for entertainment and this thanks to the new adventure of Kevin, now it gets stuck in the city that never sleeps and the wet bandits escaped from prison after 9 months of confinement. Things get even more complicated, since Kevin now has a credit card and a lot of money leading him to be discovered for theft. Very good family movie that, yes, is scarce in argument because in this sequel we see the same as before, but I still love it and prefer it instead of the original. Now it has new fun characters like the manager of the Plaza Hotel and the bellhop played by a nice Rob Schneider. The characters of the bandits are again super fun and even more in the classic traps of the end. They are also classic movies that Kevin sees at the hotel and plays with workers, brilliant. Again, Kevin will have a friend who will protect him in this cold environment, in this case he will be a woman who roams the Central Park and who owns many birds as he feeds them. The final message is the same family member of course, leaving us with a great movie that after its predecessor we yearn for more. 'Guess who is alone in New York this Christmas.

Total Recall," Awesome P.K. Dick adaptation
","Loosely inspired by one of Philip K. Dick's stories, this is a superb sci-fi action thriller set in a dystopic 2084 about a construction worker named Quaid who decides to go on a 'vacation' by having memories of a secret agent fantasy implanted into his brain, only for things to go horribly awry...or maybe not. Despite a few silly and cheesy moments, this is a wonderful, if violent action thriller that is both entertaining, and rather thought provoking. It really toys with that oft-used concept of blurring the line between what's real and what isn't, and this is one of the few films that actually does it quite well, with enough evidence to support multiple theories, with the true ending of the film dependent upon each viewer's own opinion. Like many of Verhoeven's American films, it's got a lot of violence, but provides a lot of thought provoking ideas and material, often satirical, as well. It's all presented with some groundbreaking special effects (almost all of them done practically or in camera as opposed to CGI), a terrific score by Jerry Goldsmith, and some decent, if sometimes silly, but still fun performances. And let's not forget about the most memorable thing this film has to offer: a three-breasted mutant prostitute! Definitely give this one a watch. It's not flawless, but it is remarkably strong, and easily one of both Verhoeven and Schwarzenegger's best films.",10,13,14,14 May 2017
Rocky," One of the most underrated movies
","'Rocky' is a very worthy movie that ends up moving thanks to a very well achieved climax and the great description of the characters. Sometimes I think that this movie has been devalued over time because the script is by Sylvester Stallone. It is true that his interpretation is not any wonder, but the script of this film is one of the best I've seen. With a beautiful love story between two shy characters and a not-so-high self-esteem of course, far from Hollywood's glamorous love relationships and the underlying theme of success and failure in life, we find ourselves with a very well built, it hurts whoever hurts.
If this is signed by another director and the script was signed by another person, the media of IMDb would shoot up like the foam, because I'm sick of having seen movies with scripts and very mediocre stories with averages superior to this excellent film, only endorsed by the name of the one who signed them. But in the end, all that matters, the really important thing is that we can always get excited again and again with the great performance of the fight between Apollo and the 'Italian Stallion'. Whatever they say, their three Oscars are well deserved, missing in my opinion, a deserved Oscar for best script for Sylvester Stallone and another for the best soundtrack.Wonderful and exciting final climax with Apollo celebrating the background victory and Rocky looking for his beloved Adrian. Beautiful.",9,0,0,4 September 2018
The Da Vinci Code," OK mystery movie
","When it comes to mysteries, it really does boil down to how interesting your film is. While The DaVinci Code is the definition of a film that you either choose to buy into or you will probably hate it, I still find that its intentions are in the right place and holds onto its audience from beginning to end. Viewing this film ten years ago upon its initial release and just now revisiting it for the first time since, I still acquired most of my sentiments. This is an overly religious film and although some may admire its acts, most of those who are not of the Catholic religion may just find it pretentious or uninteresting. Personally, I believe the film has a little for everyone. That being said, although I think The DaVinci Code tries very hard to be intriguing, it definitely is not without its major flaws. While I have not read the source material that this film bases its premise around, I never choose to compare. A film needs to work as a film first and foremost and if it happens to be a faithful adaptation on top of that, then it just pleases more people, plain and simple. For me, even if I have read a novel, I hardly ever draw comparisons. Following a murder at the Louvre, novelist/symbologist Robert Langdon and the victim's granddaughter Sophie Neveu must uncover the clues to secrets he left behind. From secrets locked away since the birth of Christ to uncovering the lies of their past, this film sends viewers on a roller-coaster ride of intense puzzles. That being said, the film as a whole does not live up its exciting premise. While many people may not quite fully understand what I mean by this, I can't help but call this film calming and nice to watch. There is a fine line between boring and calm, but I feel that this film walks in between those perfectly. The pacing of this film, along with the very enjoyable performances from Tom Hanks, Audrey Tautou, and Ian McKellan, are really something to admire here. Sadly, there are moments when these aspects tarnish themselves by focusing too much on the surreal, quickly making this film feel a little less believable than it should be. The big reveal in the final act will either have you chuckling or simply accepting it. Without getting into spoilers, there is a build-up as to who or what something is and if it even still exists. When it is revealed, it felt a little forced and the film lost me. Again, the pacing saves those aspects, due to the fact that it takes itself very seriously and the performances are believable. Ten years ago I would have strongly advised against seeing this film in theaters, but having time pass and revisiting this film after knowing what to expect and not enjoying it very much the first time around, I have come to respect this adaptation of The DaVinci Code. It is by no means a great film in any way, but it maintains its interesting elements throughout, masking the annoying side characters, the sometimes ridiculous plot, and the over- abundance of religion. I did admire some of the clever inclusions of the Catholic religion in order to make certain scenes more interesting, but when your entire film relies on a reveal that requires its audience to have certain beliefs, the film will definitely not please all audiences, and that aspect still remains to this day. All of that said, I do feel that this film gets better on multiple viewings The DaVinci Code still offers a generous amount of thrills and its mysterious aspects are still very enjoyable to watch. The film does get a little too self-indulgent with its beliefs, but if you are able to accept the fact that this film will not hold back, you may just find yourself enjoying it quite a bit. At 150 minutes, the film does feel its length due to its slow burn, but that is the aspect I admired most about this film. Its soothing performance from Tom Hanks, meshed with very intriguing dialogue throughout each scene when something is about to be revealed made me feel relaxed. For a specific audience, this film could possibly be the best film they have ever seen, but The DaVinci Code relies too much on that to carry the overall film. I did buy into the conclusion, but it was pretty silly. Overall, although I enjoy the film more upon each viewing, it really is nothing special in the end. It tries very hard to be great, and while certain aspects are exceptional, the film as a whole is fine. I find new things to like about this picture each time, so I may give it an even higher grade in the future.",7,0,1,25 May 2017
Titanic," Bravo
","Titanic is a movie I've seen countless times since I was a little kid and it came out. This movie is one that seems to polarize people to extremes. Some love it and will call it one of the best movies they've seen and others will hate it and label it one of the worst. As far as where I stand on it today, I still believe it is a very good film that benefits from marvelous special effects. Jack wins his way onto the Titanic in a poker game and runs into first class rich girl, Rose, when she is hanging off the end of the ship, apparently about to commit suicide. Jack saves her and they start spending a lot of time together, which really pisses off Rose's rich, but unpleasant fiancé, Cal Hockley. The story is told by the 102 year old Rose, as treasure seeker Brock Lovett searches for a diamond that was given to Rose by Cal on the boat. The movie has its share of problems. The dialogue, at times, can be corny, as can the actions. The acting, while serviceable most of the time, has some terrible moments, especially from Billy Zane and Bill Paxton. Also, the film suffers slightly from its long run time. It's not something that bothers me a great deal, but had the film been cut by something like 20 or 30 minutes, it would have flowed a lot better. Titanic isn't James Cameron's best film, but it is a majestic and epic one. I like Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as Jack and Rose, and I also really liked Kathy Bates as a first class passenger that has just come into her money. This isn't one of the best films ever, but it's, at times, fun, sad, infuriating, and joyful. There's an emotional roller-coaster going on here.",10,4,4,20 June 2017
Rocky III," The Eye of the Tiger
","It is my favorite of the whole saga, the one that has seen more times why? I guess because it was the first one I saw and I was 13 or 14 years old at the time. Nowadays I think that without being the best one it has much more crumb than what is said, I see a pleasing Rocky a point of retiring, with money, health and an impeccable image. Suddenly a hungry boxer of titles appears whose obsession is to defeat Rocky humiliating him and in a moment what happened a fairy tale becomes a nightmare, losing one of the most important fights and the life of his charismatic coach at the time of his self-esteem and mastery of the situation. Rocky III, contains some of the best moments of the saga (the death of Mick, the two fights with Clubber a great and credible Mr. T, before starring in the TV series 'The A-Team') and the background of the story tells us again the rise of Rocky from a new perspective.",9,1,1,30 January 2020
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Epic film
","Ah, the first film adaptation of the beloved Harry Potter series. Harry Potter is an 11-year-old boy who comes to find out that he is a wizard. He lives with his uncaring Muggle (non magic) aunt, uncle, and cousin since his parents died when he was a baby. They were murdered by a dark and powerful evil wizard named Lord Voldemort. Harry would be dead too, but was miraculously saved, making him something of a legend. Upon learning of his guarded magic roots, Harry gets enrolled in Hogwarts- a British school for witches and wizards. While there he learns to come into his own, meet people that are actually good to him, and learn more of his dark past. Looking back, I don't know if it was a good idea to have Chris Columbus direct this, as he does have a reputation for being something of a hack, albeit a decent one. I think his direction is okay here. Yeah, retrospectively it could have been better, but it could also have been much worse. At least with him at the helm we get a good amount of whimsy to go along with a bit of menace, and that's a good thing, as the book was likewise not too heavy on the darker stuff (though that sure changed as time went on). Many liberties are taken, which is weird since the book is quite short, and the film is two and a half hours. It does get the point across decently enough though, and also works as a piece for those unfamiliar with the source material. John Williams provides great music, there's wonderful art direction and set design, and there's some nifty set pieces too. Featuring an all-British cast, this film is impeccably cast, and the performances are good too. Finding decent child actors is hard, but they really scored here. My enjoyment of this movie has waned over time, but it's still not a terrible piece of work by any means, so check it out.",8,4,4,25 May 2017
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," My second Harry Potter-saga favorite movie
","Here's round two of the adventures of young wizard Harry Potter and friends. While not a terrible movie, this one is probably my least favorite and the most forgettable. It's more faithful than the previous film, but that's not entirely a good thing, as this one really drags, and, at this point, it's not quite necessary yet since the books didn't start getting really detailed, ambitious, and overblown until part 4. Columbus returns as director, and this time we follow 12 year-old Harry going through his second year of schooling. As if rival students, menacing teachers, and loads of schoolwork weren't enough, things start getting dire at school when people are found petrified like statues, threats are written on walls in blood, and a monster is on the loose. Even a gifted wizard like Harry may have some serious trouble coping. I can appreciate that they were trying to be more faithful to the book, but they might have been too faithful. It's my least favorite entry, and, while it's not boring, it's just not gripping enough, I feel, to warrant a film of such length. At least the film is good about balancing the tone fairly well. All the actors are fine, and they are only getting better and more comfortable with the characters with each new entry. Harris made his swan song here as Dumbledore, but his replacement in part 3 takes up the mantle with ease. All in all, a decent movie, but like I said, probably my least favorite.",7,1,1,10 June 2017
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Almost as good as its two predecessors
","'Die Hard with a Vengeance' was the first 'Die Hard' I saw in the theater and it's my favorite of the sequels. John McClane (Bruce Willis) is back and this time he's not in the wrong place at the wrong time. He's the right man, being targeted by a terorrist bomber named Simon Gruber (Jeremy Irons), Hans' brother, who wants to play a game of 'Simon Says'. If McClane doesn't do as he says, then he will blow up anything from a subway to a school in New York. McClane gets help from Zeus (Samuel L. Jackson) a guy who saves his life in Harlem, and they try to stop Simon and find out why he is doing all this. John McTiernan was the director of the first movie and this is the only sequel he came back for, probably why it's the best. The action is phenomenal, the story is exciting, and Irons' Simon is the best of all the villains in the series, besides Hans Gruber. There are some scenes that are very over the top, but this is probably the most grounded of the entire series. Great movie, and if your looking for a roller coaster ride of a movie, then pop this bad boy back in.",7,0,0,9 August 2018
August Rush," Brilliant
","Now, okay. I understand that this is a film that loves music (and I can see that), but, one problem I have with some films is the crime they commit of taking a plot that has been used over and over again and just rehashes it without adding anything new. Sadly, for August Rush, this is the truth. The acting in this film is, actually wonderful. Freddie Highmore ('Charlie and the Chocolate Factory') is wonderful as ever, but even his acting can not really save this film. The same goes to Keri Russell. The script is basically a modern telling of Oliver Twist, just added a love of music. Now, if the script only worked on the love of music and cut the rest of it out, then this film would have been better. But, it had to have a sappy love story thrown in. Now, the main reason, if any, to see this film would have to be the film's score. I mean, it is just wonderful to hear all the music in the film and it would have worked well if the film only dealt with Evan (Freddie Highmore) being a music prodigy. Now, the direction of this film (by the Irishwoman Kirsten Sheridan) is rather slow. I mean, it could have been much faster paced and it does drag for a while. Overall, I only recommend this film if you are into cliché films or just really good film scores.",9,0,0,5 June 2017
The Shawshank Redemption," The greatest movie of the history
","Who said Citizen Kane? Who said Casablanca ?. You can keep your mouth shut, because friends, this is the best movie in history.
I can't understand how in 1994 a movie (Forrest Gump), also very good but inferior to this one, won several Oscars, including the best film.
Also that year was also Pulp Fiction, another that is above Forrest Gump.
The fact is 'The Shawshank Redemption' has it all.
A great script, based on the novel of Stephen King (the best novel of him, without a doubt), a relentless direction like that of Daranbont, a spectacular photograph that is accompanied by an impressive soundtrack, the editing is excellent and the performances are all magnificent, highlighting especially the always brilliant Morgan Freeman.
My friends, if you really want to see good movies, do not hesitate to see this movie, you will love it, I loved it and it will remain, at least for many years, my favorite movie.",10,0,0,21 August 2018
Back to the Future Part II," Back to the Future was the past.
","Wednesday October 26, 2015Far from the tumult of Hill Valley, Lima appears a normal day, each inhabitant with his routines, going in public transport or in terrestrial cars towards the work, the school or the university. There is no flying car or aircraft; the roads are still up to us, you can walk on them without falling into a void.On the way to the corner bar, there is a park where the skaters juggle with the board. They are incapable of flying that objects, they only rotate in the air thanks to the impulses of their owners, without floating.Next to the park there is a coffee bar. The sign hardly shines or moves. The bar offers refreshments of all kinds, as classic as Coca- Cola, lacking Pepsis Perfect. Without holes-robots that carry the drink wherever one sits, the waiter brings the drink to the corresponding place.Along the street there are people walking with their Nike, their Vans or their Puma, which do not have an overhead propeller. Neither are dogs walking alone.My home is normal, with painted walls, a salon in which stands a television with plasma screen above a piece of furniture and a reddish sofa. I do not have the honor of having TV walls and screens that protrude from the closets, though they would be quite practical. Neither do I have the privilege of having seen Jaws 19, and if it existed, I do not know if I could bear it.I live in an environment dominated by ultra-thin computers, plasma screens, touch-sensitive phones and electronic devices connecting wirelessly, or what is the same: Wi-Fi. I live well, in a technologically advanced society, something that was predicted in a way 20 years ago in some science fiction films.Future journeys in fiction entail a dose of imagination on the part of its creator. The ambiance and futuristic arrangements that are made are impossible to be 100% successful, each director and scriptwriter try to play their way, and can hardly hit the spot. Nor do they have the obligation to be visionaries. In Blade Runner, Terminator, Clockwork Orange, Her or Mr Nobody are manufactured in one way and labeled as dystopias. If my father in the 80s, with only 20 years, had traveled 30 years ahead, it would never have been possible to imagine that the present society would be as it is.Marty McFly accidentally changed the lives of his parents at a time when he was not even born, succumbed to the temptation to change the way they fell in love, and then scored a rock and roll with Johnny B. Goode, a song not yet written (landmark of cinema). How many would we take a temporary trip to contemplate other times? Time travel in the cinema is usually pleasant to watch, even if it is foreseeable round trip trips.Back To The Future is an icon inside a family commercial cinema that had its boom from the 80's; its image and idea has influenced productions of future generations. Quite simply, the difference between the commercial of now and the former is its magic, a magic that now finds it difficult to find and / or believe. Few movies have a script as simple and effective as Back To The Future: a broken love story with a cupid falling from the future to fix it. Likewise, he likes it very much; I may be subjectivized, but I can not help it: I saw her at the age of only 9 and my memories invade me. We all know how it ends, and even Zemeckis decided to give ball to two more parts; one undervalued and the other made a little out of obligation. The second part includes three temporary trips and three different generations: the 50, the 80 and the 2010. It is a chaotic film in the plot and unpredictable, something that is appreciated. And it was the one that marked a milestone in pop culture because Marty lands in our 2015.After so many years of having seen the trilogy for the first time (and having repeated it so many times), we finally broke the 30-year span between Marty's real life and that of 2015. I feel a little older because I was thinking about the day that Marty McFly would arrive and I was far away. But here I am, writing about something that is happening today. Tomorrow Back To The Future will become part of the past once and for all. It will remain in our heads and hearts as one of the films that have left us the most footprint. Marty will not return later, will travel back in time to a landscape west and then relive as it should in 1985.Whether or not Zemeckis agrees with his predictions is not of importance. Today we celebrate something fictitious that so many fascinated in its day. For these reasons, the term 'cinema' is of such a complicated definition.",8,2,2,1 September 2017
Shrek," A twisted fairytale
","A wonderful satirical fable that cleverly subverts those well-known fairy tales, offering endless fun for kids and pure delight for adults with some astonishing visuals and acid humor while being extremely funny, enchanting and surprisingly sweet. With its colorful characters, light nature, gorgeous score, simple plot, and memorable sequences (most notably the 'Hallelujah' montage), Shrek--though it may not be the most brilliant animated film to grace the silver screen--is ultimately a rewarding, fun experience.",10,1,1,19 June 2017
Bruce Almighty," This film is cool.
","In the comedy, 'Bruce Almighty', Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey) is passed over for a job as anchorman on their local news channel. He believes that God is forgetting his needs and blatantly ignoring him. God (Morgan Freeman) contacts Bruce and gives him all his powers as a test for Bruce to show that he can do a better job. With his new powers, Bruce uses them for himself until he realizes the world's prayers are being unanswered. Before writing this review, I have watched Bruce Almighty countless times. It's my favorite movie, it's funny, and my sister and I enjoy watching it together because it's a very family friendly film. Based on the first category, Action, I would give this movie an A. There's little suspense, but the comedy in the film keeps the viewer interested. A good example of action in this film is when Bruce runs into a group of gang members beating on a homeless man, later he runs into the same group, this time, scaring them off using his newly found powers. This movie deserves an A in the category, Actors. Jim Carrey is so funny and outgoing but also believably serious when he is needed to be. A great example of this is when he asks Grace (his ex girlfriend) to come back to him and give him another chance (serious). When she refused he tried to use his powers to make her love him again even when he knew he couldn't go against free will (goofy). I gave Bruce Almighty an A in the category, storyline. The story is wacky, funny, and easy to follow. An example of putting comedy into this movie is when Bruce went to the cafe right after gaining God's powers and prating the tomato soup, resembling the parting of the red sea mentioned in the Bible. In my opinion, this film is an A in length.The runtime is about an hour and 40 minutes long. The movie is not extremely long but it's long enough to keep the viewers interested and you definitely feel satisfied by the end. In the category, cinematography, I rated this film a B. It doesn't have horrible editing and effects but they're not extremely impressive or believable. An example of this is when Bruce was filming a segment on his news channel and wanted to bring interest, so, using his powers, he made a meteorite crash down in the distance. Not fabulous editing but it made it funny. As a result, in my opinion, this move has 4 A's and 1 B. It's a great family movie and it's funny, Interesting, goofy, and some-what sad at times. It's perfect for late movie nights if you're looking for a good laugh.",8,0,0,13 May 2017
Ben-Hur," Wonderfully epic film
","William Wyler's Ben-Hur is one of the greatest epics in cinematic history. The film changed the medium forever and is a stunning accomplishment in film. Ben-Hur is a masterful piece of cinema that combines action and drama. The performances delivered by the actors are flawless and the film is powerful, exciting and of course epic in scope. The film is complimented with flawless acting and a grand musical score that adds so much atmosphere and elevates the tone of the picture. Charlton Heston delivers one of his greatest performances and is also one of the most iconic performances in cinematic history. William Wyler's directing is solid, and he tells an effective story that is slow to unfold, but is necessary. Wyler effectively plots a solid film that steadily builds up to a great climax. The cast here is brilliant. actors Charlton Heston as the title character and Stephen Boyd as Messala, Ben-Hur's friend that betrays him are great in their respective roles. The rest of the cast are great as well. Ben-Hur has some of the most iconic scenes ever put on film. Most notably the chariot race, which is a behemoth of excitement and superbly well staged, and is one of the most iconic scenes in Ben-Hur, not to mention in cinematic history. Ben- Hur is a film that is grand, epic and too big for words. This is an exciting, well acted film. Though Ben-Hur has some religious overtones, it doesn't overdo it, and it manages to be fairly limited in its content. The film is a standout piece of cinema that blends drama and action beautifully and will satisfy people who enjoy grand cinematic epics. Ben-Hur remains the film of which all grand sword and sandal epics are judged upon. With a great cast, a majestic score, stellar action and dramatic sequences, Ben-Hur's place in the cinematic medium is assured. A stunning, beautifully directed film that still has the power to capture your imagination fifty years after its release. This is a TRUE epic of cinema, and a film that shaped the cinematic medium forever.",10,3,4,25 May 2017
Speed," One of the best 90's action films
","A movie from start to finish, full of unbridled action, explosive and crazy, with a few comic touches, but all with order.And it is that this film are the ones that you get to see them and if you have to see it again does not matter. The film begins and the action and tension can be felt at first, and one can imagine what awaits him, but as the minutes progress, the film becomes more and more interesting, and it fills up scene after scene of emotion and action, and leaving no room for boredom and laziness.As usual, many movies of this type, have a fast, hurried and meaningless end, but in the case of this movie, it has nothing to do with it, but rather the opposite and where it leaves one with desire that the film does not end there and follow.Finally to point out that an action movie, you have to know how to act and know how to put faces, and in this both Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock do it like nobody else, getting the viewer to the feelings and emotions and involving them in every situation of danger.",10,2,4,8 October 2017
Click," Fun and dramatic
","'Click', movie that I have seen many times and still I still enjoy it as if it were the first time, giving me great laughs from beginning to end and passing it bomb with the protagonist actor and his main animal. In my first viewing I loved it and it was a surprise .. I have always enjoyed the movies of Adam Sandler, but this movie is already too much ... this is my favorite movie by Adam Sandler, for many criticisms that takes the actor .. I like this man a lot and I always enjoy it. The humor and the drama mix fabulously, it is totally entertaining and the actors are very well at all times, besides the good songs and the makeup, it manages to laugh in the majority of scenes and also manages to excite to the spectator, whose thing does not you wait The story is fine ... probably no one will believe it, I would consider it as a science fiction movie, but it works perfectly as a dramatic and humorous film, it does not become boring and engages the viewer totally, the characters are very well and those approximately 97 minutes of duration are enjoyable. The cast is very good: Adam Sandler, Kate Beckinsale, Christopher Walken, David Hasselhoff, Henry Winkler, Julie Kavner, Sean Astin, Joseph Castanon, Jonah Hill, Jake Hoffman ... I stand above Sandler, final, in addition to Beckinsale and Walken. The makeup is amazing in every scene .. it is very well done, in addition to the songs ... that are very well and fit fabulously with the scenes and are enjoyed. In short: this is a very good product .. it is totally underrated, it becomes totally enjoyable, entertaining, fun and dramatic .. the protagonist is planted and does not become boring.",9,1,2,7 September 2017
