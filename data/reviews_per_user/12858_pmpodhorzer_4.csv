Blade Runner 2049," Like a Marvel sequel at 1/10th of the speed
","I'm sorry, but 'Blade Runner 2049' is a ponderous bore. Deakins' photography is marvelous but the dystopian landscape overstays its welcome. It is oppressive, sad, and nihilistic. There is a reason why 'The Orville', the new Star Trek-in-everything-but-name series by Seth McFarlane is well received by tired viewers: the sense of wonder needs at least the possibility of optimism.All the pensive decades of Ryan Gosling does not mean depth. The only interesting and relevant part, and the only shot at feelings, come from a virtual AI made to replace real human contact. The bridge between virtual and real is the standout scene of the film, and it is disconnected from the grim proceedings.Why do mainstream critics herald such nightmarish work as a near-masterpiece? Have they lost any sense as to what makes a piece something more than a religious lash on our backs?",4,10,23,8 October 2017
Fight Club," They are stealing our intelligence
","Well, you need to cover the anger-market, so you do a supossedly Politically Incorrect movie full of empty and flashy FX with a lot of unnecesary violence and an ilogical twist at the end and walla!!, you have all that young people (and I'm 25) that wants to feel intelligent in your hand. Fincher has done this before, in the fascist 'Seven'.  'Memento' is not fascist, and is more intelligent, but uses the same trick.  Ok, people, c'mon, we can do better than this.  Do you liked the intelligent subtetly of 'Sixth Sense' and/or 'Unbreakable'? (the real minority movies that only a bunch of people liked because they asked for your brain).  Do you watch non-USA films? (I don't think so, and I'm NOT speaking about the Hollywood Foreign Film fodder for americans like 'Life is Beautiful').  I'm tired of posting negative anti-comments reviews, but unfortunately there is only one IMDB, and I'm trying to do a little bit of film education here.  I promisse to write about the movies that I like (the ones that generally have only five comments -or none- in their page).",5,2,4,17 January 2002
The Lion King," Do NOT go to watch this movie. Teach Disney a lesson
",The only part of their Corp. that hurts is their purse. This cashgrab is a terrible idea executed in the most unimaginative way possible. Songs are butchered because the sound and voices can't match the emotion of an animated feature. Voiceovers feel like a bad video game. Jeremy Irons was too important it seems.,2,45,72,20 July 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The Death of Fandom
","Fanboys? Where we are going we need no fanboys. This is what I take from 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' (2017). Disney decided to troll the man-children and oh boy how they did it. From in-your-face feminism to the unnecesary love of a nerdy Asian girl, they managed to fill the movie with satiric touches about the failure of fandom. This is the anti-Nolan in a way: it tells fans that they are stupid.A dark spaceship arrives ominously? Never mind, is just an iron ironing. The hero has a plan? Nah, he is stalling with a trick he learnt from Seth MacFarlane. Actually, that is the basis of TLJ: this movie is the franchise equivalent of 'The Orville', and that makes me happy. I don´t care if Leia flies in space, because Star Wars is an infantile space saga, nothing more, nothing less.There is spectacle, there are some good set-pieces, there is Mark Hammill, and also your typical Hollywood over-explanation of the situation (I shouted -internally- 'show, don´t tell' some three or four times). A good stupid time at the cinema.",6,1,2,21 December 2017
