The Rock," Very entertaining, but the action scenes are disapointing
","As a huge Con Air fan, I was looking forward to The Rock. And I was pretty disappointed. I was expecting something very  similar to that movie, with the added bonus of Sean Connery and Ed Harris. The result is less of an action film than an action-heavy thriller. Cage is superb, as always; hilarious yet believable and he makes some great lines up as he goes along. Ed Harris is excellent as a very human villain, and his heavies make some very nasty opponents for the good guys. However, Sean Connery doesn't even have a character. Perhaps the director wanted him to use his natural charm, but....at first we see Connery in jail, and we are supposed to be in awe and afraid of him. After he is released, he is an extremely nice guy doesn't even really mind being stuck in Alcatraz will a bunch of blood-thirsty soldiers on his trail. Luckily, the chemistry between him and Cage works, and they make a cool team.The other problem is the action scenes, which are much hyped but shot in Joel Schumacher style - meaning extremely fast cuts and extreme close-ups so you can't actually see what the hell is going on. This only really works in the car chase scene, and even that is not really very exiting.Overall, The Rock is very entertaining but it's no way near as good as Con Air.",Null,1,1,6 May 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Yay.
","Criticize this all you want, but most people enjoy it. It's overblwon and badly paced, but has great characters, visuals and provides a real spectacle. Awesome action as well - the lightsaber battle at the climax was better than anything in The Matrix. Finall, a film that isn't afraid to ask, 'why does it feel so good?'.",Null,0,0,30 July 2000
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not the best, but still brilliant
","Although I flew over especially to see it, after hearing all the critics views I was a little less excited. Then I went into the cinema, and you could feel the excitement in the crowds...I mean, it IS Star Wars.I guessed the ending as soon as a read about the film. Let's see - I knew Obi-Wan and Qui-Con fight Maul at the end. In the trailers you can see Obi fighting Maul alone. And neither Liam Neeson or whoever plays Maul are in episode 2.And it's PAINFULLY obvious Darth Sidious is the emperor Vader eventually kills in Return of The Jedi. Even so - who cares. It's a Star Wars film. Great effetcs. Great action. Great fun.",Null,0,1,25 May 1999
Se7en," Second only to The Silence of the Lambs
","Se7en is easily one of the best psychological thrillers ever made. The only probelm being, like in David Fincher's Alien 3, that there isn't enough excitement for a thriller. The climax is excellent though - I won't spoil it for you, but when Sommersset says over his walkie-talkie: 'Doe has the upperhand', it kicks off one of the most original and brave finales to any film for a long, long time.    As to the issue of which is better, this or The Silence of the Lambs, I can only point to the fact that Lambs isn't the sort of film the Oscar board likes at all, and it was still awarded the five main Oscars. Se7en wasn't.
   And please, if you are going to comment on Se7en yourself, DON'T GIVE AWAY WHO THE KILLER IS! Don't spoil it for those who haven't seen it.",Null,0,0,9 November 1999
Kickboxer," One the the greatest films ever made
","Kickboxer is a hauntingly beautiful portrayal of brotherly love, expressed through the ballet of kicking people as hard as you can. Watch as Jean Claude Van-Damme's brother is ruthlessly and evily almost kicked to death, and how JC himself heroically almost kicks the culprit to death. Van Damme deserved an Oscar for the way he portrayed his grief and anger through one blank facial expression. People say Hollywood treats it's audience like idiots, but they delivered a wonderful film here for people who want to see other people being KICKED REALLY, REALLY HARD.",Null,5,7,11 October 1999
Alien: Resurrection," Rehash or rerun, but not resurrection
","Alien 4, on first viewing, is a lot of fun. Exciting and scary, with plenty of action and certainly the funniest of the series. But what ever you do, don't watch it again. On second viewing, it's a rehash of the first two movies in the series, struggling unsuccesfully through the coporate demands to establish a style of it's own. I'm sure Jean Pierre Jeunet could make a great Alien film of his own, with his own weird ideas, but he doesn't get a chance to here. He has to throw it the neccesary Hollywood cliches, guns and action scenes at regular intervals in an obvious bid by the producers to Â‘be like Alien (1979) and Aliens (1986), but don't be like Alien 3 (1992)'.  It's a shame that a series previously made up of such individual, creative films in which each took their own direction, has been diluted by such a movie.
At least Alien 3, which wasn't popular with the masses, tried something different and new. Ressurection suceeds as a collection of highlights from the series, and in giving us great new versions of Ripley and the alien - an alien-a-fied ripley and a Ripley-a-fied alien respectively. But that's all. And it's absolutely disgusting as well. Don't expect Alien 5 after the poor box-office performance of this one. A script, Alien: Revelation, was written, but it looks like the future of the series is with the upcoming Aliens versus Predator.  Let's hope that lives up to it's billing.",Null,0,0,30 July 2000
Batman Returns," Second best of the series
","Make no mistake, Returns is an amazing film. It's hard to put in to words such a fantastic experience of a movie. True, the action scenes aren't particularly good, and the characters all wear black all the time, but this is still awesome movie making. The sets are magnificent, the acting first class from everybody, the costumes are superb, and it's got some fantastic scenes in it. Both Tim Burton and the writer Daniel Hamm have admitted this is the darkest of the series, and possibly too dark for a family audience, but this is how Batman is supposed to be...silent, tough, menacing, brooding...although I don't know why people think he's supposed to be insane. He's consumed with vengeance, and that is what makes him do what he does. He's not insane, he's a man who suffered a terrible tragedy as a kid.",Null,0,0,6 May 1999
Ed Wood," Burton's second best movie....
","...after Batman. Usually Tim goes over the top with imaginative visuals and neglects storyline (Batman Returns, Mars Attacks!, Edward Scissorhands), but when he's focussed on bringing something to the screen, like with Batman, it works brilliantly. And this is a wonderful movie, unusually heartwarming from Burton, with great performances and great visuals. All Burton's trademarks are there - isolated central character with a bunch of strange people who follow him, weird iconography, Danny Elfman score (very Mars Attacks!-ish), great performances from his cast and returning actors - Johnny Depp played Edward Scissorhands and is in Burton's upcoming The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow, and Sarah Jessica Parker would appear in Mars Attacks!Johnny Depp as Ed Wood constantly makes silly expressions with his mouth and eyebrows - in exactly the same as Jack Nicholson did as The Joker. It's almost as if Depp is doing an impression of him. Burton obviously likes that sort of thing.A wonderful movie by one of the greatest ever filmmakers about awful movies by one of the worst ever filmmakers.",Null,0,0,26 April 1999
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," The original plot was much better...
","The original plot for ROTJ was far better. It took far longer to rescue Han Solo, and he eventually died as the big sacrifice in defeating the empire (as a retribution for his sins as a smuggler), the Emperor wasn't in it at all, it was the Wookies and not the Ewoks who helped defeat the Empire - and Leia was NOT Luke's sister, that was thrown in at the last minute to tie up a loose end. At the end she was supposed to become Queen of her people. Anyway, that didn't happen and the story was far too light after the darkness of The Empire Strikes Back, with only the climax between Luke, Vader and The Emperor having any significant power. But the main problems with ROTJ are:1. Luke isn't as powerful and authoritative as he should be. He should be like Obi-Wan was in the original. He was a rookie in the original, strong but naive in the second, now he should be the mighty Jedi Knight the others suspected. But he isn't powerful enough. We should get the feeling that Luke really is someone of immense power.2. Luke, who is supposed to be the main hero, doesn't actually do anything. Vader defeats the Emperor, the Ewoks and Han & Co defeat the storm troopers and the rebellion pilots destroy the death star. Luke just refuses to join the Dark Side.3. The Jabba the Hutt scene at the beginning is actually the climax from Empire, so it should be there.4. It begins with a big battle, has several fights in the middle and then ends with a HUGE battle. Okay, this is Star Wars, but we need more character development.But still, it's a cool film with a cool name, and the music when Luke fights Vader is excellent. But I think it would have been better if Vader had sided with Luke against the Emperor, so the Emperor killed Vader and Luke destroyed the Emperor in a spectacular display of his Jedi power. Yeah, that would have been cool...",Null,0,2,17 June 1999
Predator," Even better than Aliens!
","What a fantastic film. Terrifying, exciting and adrenalin-pumping in equal measure, and how many movies can you say that about? The alien creature is the most realistic ever created, and it is REALLY scary, and original. The massacre of the bad guys at the start is immoral, but the good guys get punished for that later on....Arnie is at his best, yet even he is in awe of this enormous alien beast as it hunts down his party until he is the only one left....a unique combination of explosive action, cool and realistic Sci-Fi and horrifying horror built up with chilling suspense, with great special effects, Predator is an awesome movie.",Null,0,0,13 March 1999
Face_Off," Incredibly overrated
","Face/Off is two hours of Travolta and Cage firing guns at each other. Obviously neither is going to die until the end, so there's no exitement. At all. And for an action movie, you'd expect proper stunts, fist fights, chases, people hanging off buildings, helicopters, and so on. Not two hours with two guys shooting at each other. Face/Off is just an outlet for John Woo's fascination with guns. Con Air is infinitely superior.",Null,0,1,13 April 1999
Mission: Impossible," Awesome...
","Mission: Impossible was the second most successful movie of 1996. Although it beat the moderate tornado flick Twister, it lost out to the special-effects display pretending to be a film Independence Day. It should easily have come first. Impossible is one of the most complicated summer movies for a long time, and a lot of people didn't understand it. Even I didn't first time - but I still enjoyed it immensely even though I sat in the cinema wondering exactly what was going on. Director De Palma is far more talented than typical blockbuster directors (i.e. Roland Emmerich) and it shows. The movie has a very mysterious start in the fog-shrouded streets of Prague, and goes on getting more and more tense and exiting until the incredibly cool final climax - and the bit when Cruise leaps onto the helicopter and the music starts- woah...De Palma is a Hitchcock fan and you can certainly tell by this movie, using Hitchcock's favourite theme of a wrongly-accused man on the run. And it's far more entertaining than any of Alf's movies.",Null,0,0,21 June 1999
Jaws," One Of The Best Movies Of All Time
","THE best movies are more than just a film - they are an experience. Just like watching Silence Of The Lambs, you  are right there with Clarice Starling as she hunts the killer around his house, and in The Truman Show you are in there with Truman wondering what's going on and looking for a way out. In Jaws, this is achieved better than any other film. You really ARE on that boat with Quint, Brody and Hooper as the shark menaces them. Don't get me wrong, the rest of the film is superb, but it's the legendary boat sequences at the end of the movie that makes this head and shoulders above every other horror film (even Psycho and Silence of The Lambs). The shear thrill and fear you feel every time the shark comes near the boat is incredible, and when it throws itself on board and tips the entire ship up, with Brody and Quint metres away from that huge mouth full of razor sharp teeth...well, it makes you hang onto your chair with both hands. The unbearably tense climax ..it's incredible. Spielberg puts you inside the movie, and it's awesome. Odd to think the novel (which is superb, but not as thrilling) ends with the shark just dying inches away from the helpless Brody. ] The true mark of this movie is the impact it has had - all around the World, people still look at the ocean and keep a weary eye out for black, dorsal fins cutting through the water....",10,2,4,15 March 1999
The Silence of the Lambs," Not just a movie - an astonishing expierience
","The only movie that can compare to the tension and suspense of this movie, I think, is Jaws. The same elecrifying thrill and fear you feel every time the shark approaches is mirrored by a terrifying monster in this film, one that also eats people - Dr Hannibal Lector. The popularity of this film was such that I knew the plot when  I was ten in 1991, although I only saw it about a month ago. I will usually never watch films that are disgusting, and I didn't really want to watch this. But rather than being a disgusting horror, it turned out to be a psychological thriller of the highest order. The movie is amazing. It presents a gritty, realistic world like that of a documentary, with no typical Hollywood cliches whatsoever. That way we don't know what to expect. The actors are actors first and stars second, and the two central performances are simply superb. Hopkins is so effective in his role, you could easily believe Hannibal Lector really exists. In fact he is so good, he won the Best Actor Oscar for a supporting role.Even better is Jodie Foster, who has surely proven herself now to be one of the best actresses ever. The most convincing performance I have ever seen. Director Demme skillfully uses angles to make her look small and isolated in a world of danger and fear. Better than Psycho. Better than Jaws. Undoubtedly one of the best films of all time.",10,1,1,26 March 1999
Contact," Words cannot describe how wonderful this film is....
","Contact is absolutely spellbinding. Astonishing, superb, beautiful, wonderful, awe-inspiring, astounding, and extremely moving. It is the only movie ever made to create a realistic and utterly believable alien planet. Jodie Foster should have won an Oscar for this, she has surely proved now she is one of the best actresses of all time. Her visit to the alien planet was so beautiful and moving it had me in tears. You are doing yourself a huge injustice if you miss this. Simply one of the best films ever made.",Null,3,7,14 May 1999
The Birds," Not quite a masterpiece...
","The Birds isn't a great film at all - the idea is great, and so is the script, but the direction is sssslllloooowwww, and the first hour or so is tedious. The scenes with the bird attacks are very good, and the ominous precence of the birds sitting on the school climbing frame is unforgettable. But the characters are dull, and the film doesn't get exciting at all. The problem is, today's audiences are brought up on films that eschew subtle suspense for sudden shocks and gore, and can't even feel the uncomfortable atmosphere of this film and, believe it or not, Psycho as well. Which is an awful shame.But I love films that feel they don't have to explain themselves - who says films should make complete sense? It is an art form, after all - and this gives no reason whatsoever for the events taking place, leaving the audience to guess what is going on....the awesome and chilling idea behind this movie is more effective than the actual film itself, though, so I'm going to remake this film sometime.",Null,0,0,23 March 1999
