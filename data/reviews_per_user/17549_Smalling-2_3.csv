The Devil's Advocate," The Devil's Advocate
","An aspiring young lawyer joins an uninhibited legal firm but later realizes that he might sold his soul to the Devil.Expensive but tediously protracted, obvious and disappointingly unoriginal thriller that takes an awful long time to reach its scarcely revealing or surprising climax, not helped by shallow handling and horrendous overplaying from Pacino.",Null,0,1,29 March 2000
The Nightmare Before Christmas," The Night Before Christmas
","Jack Skellington, the celebrated king of Halloween Town gets exasperated by his own jubilee and decides to take over Christmas instead.Magnificent stop motion animation, very singable music score, inventive characterizations, impressive detail and a quirkily individual black humour all combine to produce an extremely ingenious and breathtaking movie experience, though its somewhat repellent curiosity may not be suitable for children.",Null,1,2,18 November 1999
Scream," Scream
","A maniac serial killer with an extensive knowledge of horror films begins to murder the habitants of a small town.A knowing, ironic, often repellent slasher movie that succeeds on being both funny and frightening, and never becomes predictable despite its constant self-parodying. Towards the end, however, it goes way over the top in both gore and hysteria, and it is difficult to describe what influence it exerted on its audience.",Null,0,0,30 March 2000
