Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A worthy successor
","The best movie in the world?  Nah, but it's plenty good enough.  The Phantom Menace has astounding visuals, riveting action, and, while its characterizations, like Star Wars's, are thin, this one has something Star Wars didn't:  major star power.  Liam Neeson, Ewan MacGregor, and Natalie Portman bring gravity and magnetism to their roles.There's more pandering to the kiddies than I'd have liked to see in this movie -- could alien sidekick Jar Jar Binks have been more annoying through most of this film? -- but there is a lot of great stuff here too.  The climactic light-sabre battle in which the evil Sith Lord Darth Maul takes on two Jedi Knights is one of the best action scenes on film.  It's almost on a level with the fight between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader in The Empire Strikes Back.Hey, I just realized.  Liam Neeson was also in Rob Roy, in which he participated in another one of the best swordfights on film. Coincidence?",9,0,0,21 May 1999
Notting Hill," A romantic comedy that really works
","This movie is a kind of scrambled clone of Richard Curtis's other great romantic comedy, Four Weddings and a Funeral.  The nice thing is that for Curtis this is apparently one of his specialties, like Robert B. Parker writing a detective book, rather than something he did because his last comedy-romance fared so well at the box office.  He is not feeding off his last work; he is simply doing a variation on a favorite theme.  Which is to say that while Notting Hill shares many elements with Four Weddings and a Funeral, this in no way diminishes either movie, and both are quite good.In fact, of the two, I think I might prefer this one.  Julia Roberts's star power exceeds Andie MacDowell's, and Roberts is given more time to develop her character, so the romance works better here than in Four Weddings.The one rehash of the Four Weddings format that didn't work on any level was the attempt to find another rock and roll oldie to revamp for the soundtrack and turn into a big hit.  In the attempt to find what would be for Notting Hill what Wet Wet Wet's version of 'Love is All Around' was for Four Weddings, we are taken through a tiresome and intrusive series of oldies and covers of oldies, the best of which (though that's not saying much) is Elvis Costello's far too faithful cover of 'She.'",8,0,0,28 May 1999
