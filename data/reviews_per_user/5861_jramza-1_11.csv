The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Disappointed. Expected better from the trailer :-/
","The movie has great performances. And anyone renting it is admittedly interested in seeing a coming of age movie - clich√©s and all. So, my problem? This movie is fine at being a modern adaptation of 'pretty in pink,' but when it tries to proffer depth, it goes heavy, and, frankly, it does not do this well. (Serious spoilers ahead) the film broaches the suicide of his best friend, by a chance comment he makes while high on marijuana- this dominoes into everyone adopting him as a Freshman buddy. But that's all we ever hear of the death of his best friend. The narrative revolves around him writing to a friend, but a friend never identified. Then we move on to an incestuous sexual abuse. This topic, worthy of its own 2 hour movie, is dealt with in the last 12 minutes of the movie, as a psychologically debilitating secret. But what about his dead best friend mentioned 30 minutes earlier? How can we empathize with one emotionally crippling tragedy when the other is just casually tossed aside? It almost seemed inept to pile on one tragedy after another, artificial and postured. Maybe that's why pretty in pink was just better as a genre film: It knew when enough was enough.",7,3,6,17 February 2013
Deadpool 2," I'm really torn...
","I loved DP1 (gave it 10/10). I did enjoy watching this on DVD (I gave it 7/10, my son gave it 9/10= 8/10). But the constant jokes to the audience that it's a low grade movie with a poor script, cheap X men characters, CGI) - well, these jokes get less funny each time, and they happen a LOT in this movie. And regrettably, the script DID feel poorly developed, the X men WERE uninteresting, and any potential for good drama or humor seemed to get lost in the bloody carnage. I love violence in a movie, but the level of gratuitous gore is definitely 'upped' several notches from DP1, with some scenes being things I could have died without ever seeing and felt none the worse. 
I enjoyed watching this at the cost of renting a DVD. (I own DP1 in 4K). But I f I had purchased 2 movie tickets to see it - I'd be feeling a bit let down.",8,1,2,26 August 2018
Crash," 'Threes Company' with roid rage
","The movie had potential- great actors, amazing actors, provoking soundtrack. But the script and dialogue- after an hour of watching everyone yelling and screaming at everyone, I just lost interest. And the yelling doesn't stop until the end. Nobody ever talks or explains anything to the other characters; if they did, every conflict would instantly resolve. It was like painfully watching an episode of Threes Company where one misunderstanding dominos out of control, usually hinged on a character who is unhinged.
I was not entertained. Just walked away with a headache.",3,1,3,10 March 2019
Alien," Deserves a 10, but...a victim of its own genius and success.
","Anyone who saw Alien before 1985 knows the iconic impact it had on all future sci-fi / horror movies that would follow. It was a creative canon, a standard, by which all subsequent movies would be held against in comparison (even its own sequels). The problem- why I give it 6.8/10? Like all classics, to be viewed by future generations, it cannot remain in a time warp, never to be compared to the future films it inspired or spawned. As my sons watched this movie, they cringed at the special and visual effects, and matte paintings, that for our generation were indistinguishable from a real life, massive set (the artists won Oscars for these masterpiece effects). But for today's generation, the special, visual, and model effects are readily distinguishable, and effectively destroy the film's illusion. My kids could easily point out where the seams to the matte paintings were located. I hate to admit it, but this film's only failing is that it cannot stand up to the newest generation of films, that it brought about.",7,2,4,11 January 2020
Collateral," Disappointingly baaaaaaad
","If you are someone who can deal with gaping plot holes, ridiculous decisions and actions by characters that can only be explained by a script writer trying to prolong a weak script, and professionals (cops, FBI agents, professional assassins, heck, even cab drivers) acting in ways inconsistent with how one would expect a professional to act, then you may actually like this movie. The way this movie deals with something as simple as a low battery on a cell phone - completely unrealistic and simply to generate tension in an otherwise weak screenplay - is incredulous. That a hit man, who goes to great lengths not to be noticed by THE PEOPLE WHO HIRED HIM, but then walks with an exposed gun and shoots up a public dance area while nobody seems to notice him - really ?!?! Seriously? The tragedy is not in all the gaping potholes, nor all the incredulous decisions and actions of its characters. The tragedy of this movie is that it really had potential to be a very good movie. But it failed to live up to that, by trying to be something much more than its screenplay would allow.",3,7,11,2 August 2015
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Wow- insanely stupid characters just ruin the movie.
","Saw this again with my 15 year old son, who was also screaming at the characters to stop acting so stupidly. The CGI is still amazing years later, and while the storyline is not terrible, the main characters' free fall decent into utterly stupid behaviors resulting in painfully predictable ramifications, just ruins the movie. Jeff Goldbloom is still great, as is his character. But his daughter, his girlfriend, and the assistant to his girlfriend are written to be unbearably annoying. The one smart character sacrifices himself to save the idiots - the saddest part of the whole film. This movie is not as bad as the recently released Jurassic world - but they share a common weakness - stupid characters that are sooooo stupid, we hope for their demise, angrily aware they will survive only because they share the politically correct views of the screenplay writers. Best scenes: 1. A Tyrannasaurus 'tip toes' quietly (whenever convenient for the plot - down stairs to sneak up on a human. To return to push a camper over a cliff, etc). 2. A girl does an entire gymnastic routine before saving her father from an approaching velociraptor. 3. A whole ship of crewmen is killed by dinosaurs without damaging cabins - no explanation how. 4. An expert states that the Tyrannasaurus has incredible smelling skills and will hunt them unrelentingly, then continues to wear a shirt soaked in the tyrannasaurus' baby's blood. 5. An expedition of survivors running from Dino's on the hunt; but one guy goes way off from the group to urinate. Yaaaaa ... The insanity just doesn't end in this movie.",4,10,17,15 May 2016
Drive," I really feel it deserved an 'X' rating for violence.
","Lots of emotional reviews on here, and understandably so. The movie is not complicated - very simple plot of a 'no questions asked', mysterious driver for hire, who gets involved with a woman, her son, and a husband with serious baggage. The acting is stoic, appropriately, so it's hard to tell if the actors are solid, or are just taking a pass. The script is cohesive and engaging - but simple. The soundtrack is different, but engaging. For me, the real problem was the over the top gratuitous violence. And I'm not a guy who disdains well-placed violence in a movie, nor gratuitous violence in the right movie. But when it's over-the-top AND gratuitous, it's (as my 16 year old son said), 'nauseating.' It was purposefully plot driven, and I get that. But the degree was so shocking in places, it made a movie I could easily have given 9/10, into 7/10. It was so disgusting, the shock value actually pulled me out of the movie. I really felt, of any movie I've ever seen, it deserved an X rating. I really would think twice letting anyone under 17 see this, even with a parent.",7,1,1,31 May 2016
Jurassic World," Expected mindless, cool entertainment. Got mindless cool CGI
","I expected to actually enjoy this movie. I love dinosaur movies and I loved all the old Jurassic Park movies. Although this movie (forgivably) lacks many of the elements that made the Jurassic Park movies so good, like a decent theme, a moral, and underlying character conflict, it also lacks characters that we can identify with or have any concern for. Even this might be forgivable, but at some points, the characters (portrayed rather flatly by incompetent acting/directing) act so idiotically, that I found myself actually hoping they would get what was deservedly coming to them, knowing that they probably wouldn't, and indeed they didn't. I find myself more tolerant of evil in a character, then just plain stupidity; and sadly, due to poor scripting, storyline, or directing, the main characters in this movie just came off as stupid, idiotic fools. While the CGI was fantastic, I really couldn't help but feel it didn't make up for having to suffer through 90 minutes of listening to vapid characters.",3,2,7,12 November 2015
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," It was so bad, it even ruined the original for me.
","Johnny depp's portrayal of willy wonka was like watching Michael Jackson on an unending LSD trip, sporting the voice of a Christian televangelist's wife. He bumbles through the storyline, seemingly clueless and inept and lacking all self-awareness- a tragic child-man who vomits into his own mouth when compelled to use the words 'family' or 'parents' - a stark contrast to the sublimely wise and insightful character portrayed by gene wilder, who drew lines from famous works of literature to draw home didactic points to those wise enough to listen. Depp's Wonka is motivated by some dark, nightmarish past, by a father who not only abandoned him for eating candy, but took the entire apartment complex with him. Poor character portrayals, interspersed with songs so blatantly bad one hopes, even as you hear them, that they will be utterly forgettable. The fact that the soundtrack makes the lyrics difficult to discern thankfully helps in that regard. I liked nightmare before Christmas and believe Tim burton has talent, but watching the repetitious motifs/moods/tones of his movies is like watching George Lucas futilely churn out Star Wars episodes 1 and 2, and wondering how episode 4 ever came from the same formulaic mind. I sadly wish I had never seen this movie. It's pedophilia undertones and creepy portrayal by Depp have marred the original forever for me.",2,3,5,5 September 2015
The Big Short," See 'inside job' instead
","I really wanted (even expected) to love this movie. I'm a big Steve Carrel fan (and I did live his performance in particular, in this movie). But while it had a serious task to tell the story of the subprime mortgage scandal and the complicit involvement of the banksters , and to tell the story in a manner intelligible to the average person, it told the story strangely. The intense performance of Christian Bale seemed oddly misplaced in a story where characters frequently stop and talk candidly with the viewer. The storyline constantly juxtaposes the seriousness of the repercussions, with offhandedly placed humor. It juxtaposes the greed of the banksters with that of the protagonists who are somehow excused for the profit they gleaned as wealth was redistributed to them, while others lost homes and jobs. And, indeed, as one reviewer noted here, many lost homes because they bought their homes unwisely, and the taxpayers were left to bail out everyone. In short, for what I think this film is trying to accomplish, I much more recommend seeing 'inside job.' It's just a far better, straightforward film.",5,2,5,6 October 2016
Lucy," Not great. But fun. So not bad either.
","No need to go into great spoiler details, except to say it's all been done before. This is not any better, nor much worse, than its predecessors. The spoiler is in how closely it thematically follows its predecessors: Altered States (1980) Transcendence (2014) Limitless (2011) Based on an untrue scientific principle that we can utilize only so much of our brains, it makes speculation as to what a fully used brain might accomplish. And this is where, despite decent directing, fine acting and a sufficiently worked out screenplay, it lost me- on sheer lack of credibility. It is one thing to say a super human mind could accomplish insanely fast calculations, assimilations, and mind-body coordination. It is another thing to say it could accomplish telepathy, teleportation, and time travel. I became incredulous, as it tried to be incredible.",5,0,2,7 September 2015
