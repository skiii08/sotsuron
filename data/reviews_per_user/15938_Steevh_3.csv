Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Oh-my-god It's incredible...
","CLICK! (Disengage critical faculties) Ah, that's better. 'The Phantom Menace' is quite possibly my fourth favourite film of all time. Utterly stunning from the first moment, it rockets along, continually showing you things you never thought you'd ever see. The most fun I've had in a cinema for sixteen years- and yes, the last best time was 'Return of the Jedi'. There really is nothing wrong with this; it's exciting, funny, frequently astonishing, and has a twisty-turny plot that manages to tell a decent story, while at the same time setting up five more movies. Not a bad trick, if you can do it.I honestly can't remember the last time I was this impressed with a movie.CLICK! (Engaging critical faculties) Okay- so it's a wee bit overlong, and some of the Coruscant/ Jedi Council stuff is plodding- but structurally it's vital for the saga, so we'll forgive that. The yoda puppet, on the other hand, is awful. In 'Empire' Yoda was a character- it didn't matter that he was a rubber muppet, he was *real*. Here, he's plastic, unconvincing and has lost much of what made him so powerful in the first place, including his sense of humour. He doesn't even sound right- not just the voice, but the dialogue is wrong: it's cod-Yoda.The much maligned gungans, especially Jar Jar, were a joy. Superbly done, and very funny. Loved 'em. Boss Nass, in particular was a character the like of which most films would kill for- simple, striking and unforgettable. Only their big blue balls of -what?- 'light goo'? in the final battle were dubious.. everything else; fine. And the Jar Jar/ 3P0/ R2 sequence involving his tongue, hand and the droids' comments will in years to come be cherished in just the same way as much of the original trilogy are today.There- I tried to do a critique, and I ended up defending it. It's wonderful; in every possible way.",10,0,0,21 July 1999
Schindler's List," Black and White- yet no Grey.
","I'm going to have to agree with a previous comment that 'people only liked this because it was seen as unwise' to objectively comment. This was a 'cause movie'- and as such is no better, or no worse, than the others. Like 'Amistad' that followed it, it's plodding, pretentious and badly shot. The black and white cinematography lends nothing to it except the illusion of reality; which it isn't: it's a film. It's a story. Not a documentary. It's a constructed series of events, with 'characters' and a 'narrative' and a 'script'. The fact that the holocaust-survivors laud it as 'how it was' is the ultimate expression of its failure. The novel left you thankful that you weren't there, but never once made you feel like you were. Spielberg's film tricks you into imagining that it shows how terrible the holocaust was- it doesn't. And can't.Many have stated that they 'understand' the events of Hitler's Germany through the movie. By giving them this false 'understanding'; Spielberg has cheapened it, and made it more comfortable than it should be. Subjectively, for many, this grants them leave to display false, *constructed*, grief for something that no amount of 'grieving' can in any way come to terms with.As a film; a piece of fictionalised narrative, it suffers from hammy performances... most obviously the ridiculous Ralph Fiennes with his sitcom nazi- a safe, comfortable idea; neatly slotting him into the 'bad guys' package that drama utilises, but 'real life' finds no easy place for.A film shot in black and white that regrettably uses these absolutes in its storytelling. An effective parable? Perhaps. But a worrying one.Steev",3,4,17,13 August 1999
The Shawshank Redemption," Number One?
","How the hell did this get voted number one in the top 250? Meandering adaptation of a tight little King short. Typically hammy performances and so sugary you could drop it into the world's water system and everyone would go hyper.It's okay, as adaptations go, but there is soooo much better out there.Steev",9,0,1,6 May 1999
