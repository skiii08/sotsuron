Walk the Line," Walk The Line, a great movie!
","I loved the movie, and thought Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon perfect actors for this movie. They both played their parts so well, not to mention the songs they sung themselves. As soon as I got out of the theater from seeing the movie, I went and bought the soundtrack. I loved it, but was disappointed to find that the one song I really liked the most 'Time's A Wastin', was not on the CD. That song will be a huge hit if Phoenix and Witherspoon decide to record it in its entirety. I really think they should, I know it would top the charts. Anyone that loves country music will truly enjoy this movie. Johnny Cash is a country legend. I never knew his brother's death haunted him most of his life. In fact, I never knew he had an older brother until I seen this movie. Also, never knew his addiction was that bad or that long. I also want to add, the movie really portrayed the deep love Johnny Cash had for June Carter. Never have I seen such a powerful, long-term devotion, and passion for another human being. I think when June finally said 'yes' to Johnny's proposal, made him the happiest man alive! He finally got what he wanted and waited for..........",10,2,4,29 January 2006
