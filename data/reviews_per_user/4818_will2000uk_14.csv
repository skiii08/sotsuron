Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," 16 years wait.... The verdict
","Hype, backlash against hype and more hype on video release. Most people are in Love or Hate camps with Episode 1: I don't hate it, I was just disappointed. I was exciting at the prospect of seeing a new Star Wars for the first time, even when I saw the rolling credits I was all but cheering: Then something went wrong. First things first, what's so bloody important about Naboo? This is never explained. Not even die-hard fans know this, George. The least you could do was tell us. This film treats us as fans, not an audience. The mitochlorian thing is a poor attempt at plausifying (Is that a word? It is now!) the Jedis. As for the dreaded Jaa Jaa Binks? Suprisingly, he's not as irritating as people make out. The Gungan Leader (Brian 'Shout in funny accent' Blessed) was for me, the most teeth-gnashingly irritating guy on the block. Three cool sequences (The Gungan underwater, podrace and final battle) do not a great film make. And please ditch Ewan McGregor.",Null,0,1,11 April 2000
The Big Lebowski," The Coens Strike Gold!
","A truly brilliant film, typical of the Coens' ability to twist genres. Here they deconstruct the ransom movie, but plant in twists, dream sequences and bowling. If all this sounds odd to you, then trust me, it is. Steve Buschemi (as ever) is superb, if a little underused as butthead Donny. John Goodman is a superb shouty Nam vet with a brilliant catchphrase 'AM I RIGHT, OR Am I WRONG?'. And to complement these two superb Coen regulars, Jeff Bridges does a superbly relaxed turn as Jeffrey 'The Dude' Lebowski (He bowls in his dressing gown, man!) The Searchers-esque intro is brilliant, and 'The Stranger' is one of the funniest voiceovers ever, apart from the British one that does Earthworm Jim. In short, enjoy the twisted world of the Coens!",Null,0,0,11 July 2000
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Lewd, crude, f***in' superb!
","I love this movie, and it's crude cultiness improves on video. Music,drama, romance, (SPOILER) implants and the confusion between Brits and Frenchmen. What more do you want? Ah, less lag in the middle. Screw you! 9/10",9,0,0,7 July 2000
Chicken Run," Clucking brilliant!The ultimate chick flick...and other puns!
","This is a truly, superbly crafted animated film. I had a permenant grin on my face, and featuring some of the world's most brilliant dialogue, (' I don't want to be in a pie. I don't even like gravy' to name but one terrific line.) Great characters, great moments and an almost non-existent lag in the middle. Chicken Run is 'not as good as I expected. It's better!' 9/10",9,0,0,3 July 2000
LÃ©on: The Professional," A superbly crafted thriller
","Some films make you realise that there are still geniuses in the film world. Leon is  fantastic both emotionally, and visually. The light straining through bulletholes, the secret knock on the door and a superb end shootout are all elements of an incredible film. Gary Oldman is admittedly a bit hammy, but aside from that I can find no critisisms (with the exception of being renamed 'The Professional', why?). This film is a modern classic which all should see. 10/10",10,0,1,4 July 2000
Watchmen," Honestly, who will watch the Watchmen?
","I'm sure Alan Moore would have an ironic chuckle at the superficial treatment of his work. That's not to say it's a train-wreck flop, but I do honestly wonder who it's supposed to appeal to and what the point was.It sounds odd, but the film it reminds me of most is Daredevil- there is a playful narrative structure, a desire for a 'darker' comic book film and a degree of campness that is either unwitting or woefully misjudged.For those who don't know the plot, essentially someone is killing off superheroes and a gravelly voiced man in an ink blot mask (Rosarch) is investigating. The superheroes themselves are now retired (except the aforementioned tar gargler) and suffering various personal issues.The problem is that things have come full circle- The Comedian looks too much like Robert Downey Jr, the issues of a double life have been better explored elsewhere, and Sin City has already provided us with gaudy, superficial shocks and violence. Granted, none of these film adaptations would exist without Watchmen's subversiveness, but it still feels like an ageing hipster trying to prove he's 'with it'.And then we come to 'visionary director' Zak Synder. What is clear is that he loves Watchmen, and tries his best to match it. But it's like a fairground caricaturist painting Mona Lisa- I'm sure he means well, but it's not the real thing. Now I'm sorry, but in my opinion the 'visionary' tag belongs to people like Stanley Kubrick, David Lean or Orson Welles. Pretty pictures and ludicrously OTT violence doesn't make you an A-list director, nor does the vast sum of money a film might make (though in this case more likely from kids sneaking in).If this sounds harsh, it's not because Watchmen is a bad film. The Dr Manhattan storyline is well handled, and adds some much needed pathos and tragedy to an otherwise superficial story. As Gilliam rightly predicted, the running time of a film doesn't allow sufficient room to breathe for the other characters, so we aren't give enough to sufficiently care about them.In short, a good metaphor for the film is its soundtrack- for every clever use of Bob Dylan and Simon and Garfunkel, we get the ill-judged Leonard Cohen Hallelujah (a great song now sadly overexposed) or 99 Red Balloons. If you can forget the comic, if you don't mind excessive violence and slow motion and not that bothered about character development, by all means go and see it.",5,3,6,8 March 2009
American Beauty," Look closer...See it for what it really is
","Don't be fooled by hype, by critics or the multiple awards. American Beauty, like it's namesake, is aesethetic, with nothing  deep below the surface.      Sam Mendes is betrayed by his theatrical background, which renders his images as 2D tableau. It has impressive moments, and Kevin Spacey is a fine actor, but a lack of motivation, drive or substantial plot means it is incapable of providing a satisfying message or characterization. The teenagers exist as a limp sub-plot, the neighbour is a cartoon caricature worthy of Dick Dastardly (but not as funny) Annete Benning's falseness goes way beyond her character, and the whole thing  is nothing more than pretty pictures. I was told (by a v. close friend) , 'You take what you can from it, you draw your own opinion.' This was the case. However, all there was to be taken was some aesthetic pleasure, occasionally interestic camera work, some funny lines, some dramatic moments... and Kevin Spacey. Look closer...Look beyond hype.",5,1,2,10 August 2000
Being John Malkovich," MalkovichMalkovichMalkovichMalkovichBrilliantMalkovichMalkovich
","All hail the insane genius of Spike Jonze! I fell in love with this film from the brilliant opening puppet show. Treating us to a bizarre ride through life (Like people ride Malkovich....Eh?), Jonze goes through more emotions and styles than several films, with both believable and insane characters thrust into the same situation and (often) the same head. Also, three superb cameo appearances: Charlie Sheen (Like John, his greatest role is as himself.), Sean Penn on puppetry, and a leering Brad Pitt (look carefully.) This deserved Best Picture over the formulaic Insider and the mundane American Beauty.    Special mention to John himself: A truly brilliant performance. This film should be seen by everyone by law. View the world through a completly different set of eyes.",10,0,1,25 September 2000
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," This is a true classic
","So Hotpot thinks the flying loses the film its serious edge? Since when did it have to be serious? He is clearly not familiar with the concept of the Wudan stories. Crouching Tiger (Or Wo hu zang long) is the fairy tale equivalent of the Matrix. Just as Matrix operates within sci-fi conventions, this film operates within Wudan principles. If you aren't prepared to accept the conventions of this film (ie the flying), you won't enjoy it. I myself was totally immersed in a film of pure character. Each fight sequence has an emotional level beyond the powerful choreography of The Matrix. Unlike MI2, this advances flo mo rather than using it as another cinematic device. Okay, for some it will be overlong, but the film for me goes beyond typical film ideas. In the words of  Mr Glass, 'This is art!'",10,0,0,5 February 2001
This Is Spinal Tap," What could be blacker than black?
","The craziest, funniest, brilliant film! Every single moment of this film gives me something that amuses me, and the minute I stopped watching I wanted to watch again...In fact, I did. Each character, from Nigel Tuffnell to Artie Fufkin, puts a smile on my face the second I think about their funny lines... And the legendary Stone 'Enge sequence rates amongst the truly excellent film moments! Not a documentary, or a 'mockumentary', but a big rockin' ROCKUMENTARY! 100% brilliant",Null,0,1,30 October 2000
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," One f*ckin' fantastic movie
","This is such a superb film! When it seemed like Brit flicks were in the doldrums, this fresh piece of cool gangster cinema came from almost nowhere. Vinnie Jones, for a start, is fine at acting his part as hardman thug. (My sister once met him, apparently he's quite a nice guy, believe it or not.) The edgy, complex plot is great, and some of the characters and situations are brilliant (Just witness the way the black geezer takes out the guy who asks him to turn the volume down.) There's only one recommendation I can give that's high enough- Go see it!",Null,0,0,6 June 2000
The Lion King," The melter of a stony heart
","It was not until watching this film that I grew a soft spot for Disney movies. The typical combination of music, comedy, drama and romance is perfect? Hang on... Did I just say drama? Yes, The Lion King has moments of pure drama unrivalled by many feature films, let alone Disney films. WARNING!SPOILER!.......... When Mufasa dies, and you see Simba's tears, the mournful music...IT'S TOO MUCH! ;( I also love this film for it's use of top British talent, ieRowan Atkinson as Zazu and Jeremy Irons as Scar (Is there anybody who can do better bumpkins and villains?) Indeed, there is a fine ensemble cast, and Matthew Broderick has never been better (with the exception of his turn in The Cable Guy.) People here have mentioned the comparison to Shakespeare, particuarly to Hamlet. But Robert Guillaume's turn as Rafiki bears more relation to King Lear's Fool. Indeed, through manipulating Shakespeare and using an original story, Disney found the ability to reach it's pinnacle. Oh, yeah, and Timon and Pumbaa made my laugh my ass off (The word 'Mook' is now part of my vocabulary.) Brilliant 10/10",10,0,0,7 July 2000
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," 'Come and see the lovely fjords'(Some spoilers)-GET ON WITH IT!
","Yes, the credits alone put many so-called comedies to shame. One of the funniest films I've ever seen, with it's own skewed logic (' You mother was a hamster, and your father smelled of elderberries.', 'You silly Arthur King') Of course, you have to mention the Knights Who Say Ni. I have never laughed so hard at a two letter word, and then the other one.. 'Ekky Ekky Vakung...' (Whatever, I can't say it.) The cinematography, camera angles and slow motion sequences all mock the typical epic (Sir Lancelot's sequence has to be seen to be believed.) And above all, where else would someone accuse Sir Lancelot of being gay? 9/10, for a slightly slow start and head-scratching ending ('GET ON WITH IT!')",9,0,0,8 September 2000
Gladiator," The Epic Is Back!
","There are so many amazing elements of Gladiator, I can't really describe it. Having been to Rome before watching Gladiator, I can confirm that you can imagine it to be exactly like that.       The cast (including the indomitable Russell Crowe, the honourable Richard Harris,  delightfully sleazy Oliver Reed and terrific villainous Jaqouin Phoenix) all add to  a destined classic. A majestic 10/10",10,0,0,28 September 2000
