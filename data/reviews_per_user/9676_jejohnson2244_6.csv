Casablanca," A Really Great Movie, However
","I wouldn't say it was the best film ever made because it isn't. On the contrary though, it is a classic film that anyone would love and it is to me the grandfather of clichés. First off saying someone doesn't have a soul is clearly cold in my opinion because maybe they are literary, don't watch movies or just didn't understand it and they don't need to be penalized for it. It's an old film noir with really great dialog and amazing acting ( ahead of it's time) and it brings in what most cinema's have today, the art of clichés. First of all the main character Rick is a prime example of a tough guy, not buff, but he proves muscles don't make the man. Then you have Ilsa, the love of Rick's life and she bring the acting game up well. Now Ilsa is married to a guy named Victor Laszlo, and things get very complicated as the German police start to threaten throwing him in an isolation camp and you just have to see it for yourself. It starts with the atmosphere as the Warner theme plays and the map of Casablanca fades in, which loads of films used a lot later and gives that it is an action adventure romance. Next is the dialog, which strongly is by far the best I've heard in a movie to date which adds both mystery, romance, drama and most important humor which is kind of lacked in movies today. To continue we have the battle of the instruments (used in comedies), the mild bar fight which looked incredibly stunning for 1943( though it only lasted about 40 seconds) and finally a signature in westerns, the who shoots first duel at the very end which was fast paced but timed and played out very well. All in all a great film and as Rick said ' This looks like the beginning of a beautiful friendship'. It's worth it.",8,0,3,24 October 2010
Iron Man 2," Iron Man 2 Hmmm
","Is a great film if you have the mind of a mentally challenged dog though in my opinion feels like the first one all over again. The first film was great though very campy, the second one starts off a little serious. I thought 'Oh boy this is really gonna be deeper' but nope!!. Not even 30 minutes into the film and it already goes downhill to the campy roots of the original. Tony must find a way to stay alive so the iron from his suite won't severely poison his bloodstream , then the movie jumps the shark but to be quite honest it is a high budget over the top superhero film so what do you expect. The middle of the film is just constant conversation but the action takes off in the end. So what do I say about this far from great action film, I would rate this a 2 out of 10 because it just lacked way too much quality and the middle was really really boring. Just skip it.",2,1,3,24 June 2010
Taxi Driver," Not as disturbing as I thought, but QUESTIONABLY weird
","Lets face it this is a good movie (if your talking weird) in its own way but I didn't find anything disturbing about it. I found that the twelve year old prostitute made me very uncomfortable when(spoiler) talking about selling her crotch or unbuckling a grown man's pants but I guess that's the life of a prostitute. Anyway this could be a nineteen-seventy six batman film if the man didn't kill because hey who knows if batman loves porn or not. Back to the script, a 26 year old discharged military man that thinks an awful lot, writes in his journal and has trouble sleeping drives a taxi cab for money and travels through the bad parts of New York. As he sees the scum and filth of this city, he wants to do something about it but what? While he decides, he tries to talk to women but sucks at it so he stalks a woman at a newspaper center who notices him sitting in the taxi. This gives him the chance to be Dr. House and analyze her feelings which some how impresses her... Odd. Well not knowing a woman's worth nor movies takes her to an educational booty movie and she leaves him boo hew. Any-who he talks to a senator running for president about the scum and filth and surprisingly (sarcasm) could care less. So he runs into the 12 year old prostitute again(the one mentioned at the top. Note: the first time he saw her was on one of his routes though she was doped up trying to escape. The second time he nearly ran her over & then decided to follow her to a traffic light)and promises to get her out of the game by becoming a vigilante though the girl thinks he's weird (don't blame her). He goes and kills the pimps and all is well. It doesn't sound to exciting(because it ain't) but it is very interesting in its own way. DeNiro's acting as his character is very well done playing a young man who is weird and so on. I'd say give it a rent or buy it cheap on DVD ( trust me, it might bore you & you'll never watch it again),just don't show this to your kids as a lesson parents with sense(especially those with no sense.)Masterpiece, Not in my eyes.",6,0,3,1 May 2011
Dreamgirls," Bland
","This movie is far from good, its just so bland I could do a musical on how to sit on my butt and say bungalow while farting. I mean the acting is very bad, the dialog is atrocious and the songs aren't in anyway memorable. When they played the remake of Jennifer Holiday's 'Your Gonna Love Me' performed by Jennifer Hudson (Who I loved in secret lives of bees)on the radio, I got tired of it after two plays, heck I don't like the original song either. Anyway I sat through it and just got bored so quickly I just ran around the house and rolled on my belly to pass the rest of the time because this musical was an 'A' flat literally just plain flat. The ending was a bomb in the tush and the singing and characters gave me a headache. All in all just terribly bland. Note 'If anyone wants a decent musical, watch the movie this was inspired from named Sparkle, because it's way better than this.",1,0,1,31 October 2010
Transformers," Explosions and Boobs With Talking Robots (MEGATRONN!!!!!!!!!!!)
","Every horny mans dream when you look at Megan Fox but with robots. Nowhere near a masterpiece but who really cares..... all the people wanted to see were fighting robots and that's what you get along with corny jokes and stupid innuendos ( Michael Bay's vision). Though a little average, it does have a plot, Optimus and his soldiers must rescue a cube in order to keep Megatron from resurrecting some robot building or something to that nature. Though the jokes are corny and childish, the script is far fetched( but its science fiction so who cares) the acting is terrible and the action scenes stole the movie, this is just one of those mindless movies where you just fire up your stereo ( subs are a must for this, if you only have 1, GET 5 MORE), sit back, throw your brain out the window and enter retard mode because once you see the action in this film, you will scream MEGATRONNN!!!!!!!!",6,0,8,24 June 2010
Alice in Wonderland," If You Aren't Use to Tim Burton, You don't Need to See this
","From all the flack I've read about this film, I just passed on seeing it a while back. So many negative reviews show no hope for a descent Disney flick. So today I watch it since my father rented it on DVD a day ago (after all my sister said it was just average so what can I say and she's sixteen.) So after watching this supposed to be flop, I was absolutely shocked!! Turns out that the flack this film got was just flock because this has got to be the most amazing thing I've seen since well any live action film from Disney ( Prince of Persia doesn't count). Not only is it a nifty story but its what shall I say people don't have anymore? ORIGINALITY!!!! I mean come on 3-D is crap especially when you take the same image and split it in two with blurriness. If you want 3D get kicked in the face or punched in the eye. The visual art is very fascinating, the acting is amazing especially the red queen. I mean she kept yelling during the film but it matched her personality and gave the character charisma. Depp as the hatter was just creepy and spectacular. ( Why couldn't he play the joker? o well). The animals had to be on PCP or coke because man were they nut. All in All I rate this with 9( since I don't know how to put this in a 8. 9) out of 10 because Burton just puts his spin on it very well and it shows. Though I seriously recommend this to kids 12 1/2 years of age because some scenes for example (when Depp stares at one of the animals at the table and his eyes turn dark and glow or the scene when the mouse rips the cats eyeball out and runs with it on its sword like a an olive on a skewer)will cause either severe nightmares or psychological issues( I doubt). This movie deserves its 1 billion dollars because it earned it.",9,1,3,24 June 2010
