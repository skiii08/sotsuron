Scarface," I remembered it as better!!
","I saw this movie for a second time after almost 10 years.I have to say I enjoyed it more as a kid.Even if Pacino does a great job, his latino character is sometimes too over the top.The 80's aesthetic is almost campy and the score is AWFUL, TERRIBLE!! It ruins many good scenes.Pfeiffer steals the movie.",7,0,0,6 July 2000
Pearl Harbor," This movie breeds hate.
","A fascistoid, pretentious, cheesy republican movie. Big budget, nice FXs as usual.And also as usual, a dumb, shallow story. the only (sad) innovation is the message full of hate it contains. The actors do what they can with a terrible script (the lines are laughable at!), their best choice would have been not to work in such shameful production, but for sure they were very well paid. 'Pearl Harbor' has achieved to be even worst that Titanic.Congratulations!",1,0,0,25 May 2001
