Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," History the way you'd never expect it!
","I admit, when I first heard about this movie I was really sceptical. Who wouldn't? It sounds completely absurd even as a work of fiction. Who'd think of putting Lincoln and Vampires together in one movie? But after seeing the first trailer I was really looking forward to this as it had the dark mood and right amount of action you'd expect from such a film.The movie itself is amazing. It wasn't complete fiction where everything was just a story. The important parts of history where in this. Obviously not as they happened, with the Vampires, but always with a touch of real happenings. The deaths of Lincolns mother Nancy and son William, the marriage with Mary Todd, travelling on the Mississippi to New Orleans, his view on slavery and the war, just to mention a view. I as a Vampire fan from child days on thought the way they were portrayed was just right. They might not have been burnt by the sunlight and have two main fangs rather than only fangs but other than that the way they were shown was great. I think seeing this in 3D would've been even better. The action scenes were just right, maybe not as harsh as some thought but to me it didn't have to be all brutal. In fact if it would've been the rest of the story might have been pushed to the background. As I said in other reviews I always like to mention the music as a movie would be nothing without it. It either complements the film or disturbs it with unnecessary songs and sounds. The music was just right, adding the dark mood more intense than a picture only. Last thing: though the final scene was a nice work of graphic going from past to modern present I think the movie should have ended with the Monument done.9/10, nothing really big I can subtract besides the few little points mentioned. If you're a fan of mystical, fictional movies, not even necessarily with Vampires but also just monsters, this is just for you.",9,4,8,15 October 2012
Dear John," Crying guaranteed!
","I was just listening to the Soundtrack and remembered how great the movie was. I'm not really into Romance nor Drama movies but this is definitely one of my favorites! I don't even know what made me watch it but I'm so glad I did. The acting was great, the story was amazing even though it was sad, the music in the movie underlined it perfectly. I'm not really the crying type at movies either but I cried at so many parts because it was just so touching. It shows the ups and downs of life, how quickly one thing can end or start, how you should live every moment to the fullest.There is this man who is fighting for his country and even though he knew he just had a summer with this girl he still wanted to spend it with her. They have deep feelings for each other but the events happening are just so sad that even a strong connection is breaking up. To fight against a disease is hard, having to care for a child while fighting is even harder. You somehow want John to be with her again but also feel for the friend.I can only say it again, this movie touched me and I'm in love with it!",10,0,0,25 September 2011
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Bigger, better, Mission: Impossible
","I'm not a fan of Tom Cruise as a person and that sometimes influences my opinion on a film. Even with this point in the back of my mind I must say that Tom Cruise still got it. He's a fantastic actor who doesn't even chose to have a stunt double in MI4. I couldn't even think of trying some of these. Now to the main film. You may think it's going to be just like all the other action movies and all the other Mission: Impossible parts. But with every new part of the series it gets even more spectacular: the equipment is beyond imagination, the locations are mind blowing, the secret plans are super clever, the characters are cool and smart. Also the trailer was that good that I just wanted to see this at the movies and couldn't wait for it to be released. I haven't seen any MI film at the movies and this was definitely a great decision. The best action film in years.I'm giving it a 10/10 because there was nothing I didn't like about this movie and it was worth every cent!",10,203,327,18 December 2011
Evil Dead," Don't give up on it if you didn't like the original. It's way better to me.
","When I first heard of the remake I thought it would completely suck. I really don't like the original. I'm not into older films in general but in my opinion it was just weird and rather a sick kind of funny than a shocking Horror. A lack of great visuals really disturbed me there. Next to the rather stupid story. Of course it wasn't going to beat the visuals of the remake as there's simply more possible in film and costumes/make-up nowadays. Also the funniest thing is that you can't get the original here - until today. It's simply not being sold since it got taken from the market back then. A joke to me, there's way more shocking stuff out there. And the remake is out here. Just funny.Back to the actual film: the first trailer had me. Though the original wasn't for me I thought it seemed quite well done. As a Horror fan that's definitely enough to make me want to see it.Overall I liked it way more than the original. They created a better storyline around the strange happenings which was kind of missing in the original. Some things like the rain towards the end was a great idea to me. That was really something. Just to mention a few things without giving anything away.I still can't rate this as a 10 - it was not shocking, rather sick minded and brutal. I know a Horror can be that but you're promised a shocker and it just isn't. Im comparison to other films, a 6-7 would be appropriate to me so I'll make it a 7.",7,1,12,3 July 2013
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," Beautiful ending to a Saga!
","I hear it all the time... people making fun of The Twilight Saga. 'You call that a great Vampire movie? The main guy sparkles... I can't take that serious... My girlfriend made me watch this with her...'. Let's not forget that this is also a lovestory, actually a very big part of it, and that Vampires are fictional beings. However the author creates or portrays them - that's the way they are. And they're not too far from original Vampire stories. They are cold, pale, drink blood - all features of a classical Vampire like the famous Dracula. Also the view of these fictional characters has changed. There are more modern stories, movies and series where they don't get burnt in sunlight or drink human blood (I know some in Twilight do but in the modern perspective they chose). It's as simple as the innovation of cars for example. They're still there to get you from one place to another but do they look like 100 years ago? Do they have the same features?Now to the movie itself: I thought that the final definitely did the Saga justice. I read the books, of course they're better, what do you expect? I'ts hard to top a book as a movie will never be as extensive and describing in some things. It would also be really sad if that happened. I hated the fact that they split Breaking Dawn into two but after seeing the first part I was convinced. The way it ended was great, don't want to give away anything here though. You will be surprised even though you might already know they changed up the end a little bit before seeing it. They really had me there. I was sitting there, looking at my friend with this 'Woah, are they serious?' expression. I liked the way they changed it, it didn't throw off balance of the concept.One thing bugged me a little. Aro was being a little too silly at the ending part of the movie. A serious part where this didn't belong that much even though that's part of his character. It was still too much.The musical choices where right on point by Carter Burwell, as known from the other parts. Really charming the visuals.One last thing. I read the book about 2 years ago so I can't really tell how different it was from the film anymore. I did remember parts that I read while seeing them but not everything. I don't judge a movie by that anyway. I think about what I see not what I expect to see.Open your mind a little when seeing this or any Twilight movie. It's not your average Vampire flick.",9,4,10,26 November 2012
Sinister," Not what I expected - too predictable and too unscary!
","An average score of around 7 is like a 10 in the Horror genre. I've come to known that within time. I don't completely rely on these scores and hardly ever agree on them but to me they're like a benchmark. It rarely happens that this benchmark is very far from what I'd give the movie. Rarely but not never.I've just seen this film and I already can't think of what I liked about it. The story lacks character, I didn't feel like it was something new. The scares were hardly recognizable to me. What I hated most is the predictability. Not even halftime in I already knew how it would end. I want to be so much into the story that I don't think about such things. That didn't happen for me. The music in a film usually charms it,a film would be nothing without it as I always say but here it was just odd. I didn't like the effects to it.I really tried to like Sinister but I just didn't. In comparison to other film ratings I can't give it just 1 so I'll make it a 2.",2,6,14,28 November 2012
The Hangover Part III," The best things come in threes - so does Hangover!
","I'm really starting to think I'm seeing different films than other people most of the time. Or my sense of humor is just completely different from everyone else but I honestly loved it! I laughed a lot, I liked the story, I thought it was crazy funny. I was a little surprised how the giraffe scene I know from the trailer ended. I know it's just a movie but it was a little harsh.The acting was brilliant,Zack is doing a wonderful job as always! It was great how so many of the past characters were back in it.Want to see it? Watch it! Don't care for critics! I stopped doing it a long time ago.",9,1,4,31 May 2013
The Cabin in the Woods," Seems like a hate it or love it movie...
","First of all I must say that the trailer really made me want to watch this. It looked like something new, never seen. I was waiting for it to finally be released. It's not even out here (Germany) yet! 4 months after being released in many countries. That is happening to a lot of 'expected to be great' movies here I'd like to see before everyone is talking about it on the internet. Mostly happening to Horror. Of course this has nothing to do with the movie but I'm sure everyone can understand how upsetting and frustrating that is. Anyway I'm so glad I got to watch this before actually going to the movies because I would've been really disappointed. Kudos for the things like the originality, no question. That was really something different. Other than that the movie was just strange and random. To me they started totally wrong. I really thought I was watching the wrong film! Showing that there's something or someone behind the happenings right at the beginning was bad. Things should be revealed, discovered by the viewers imagination, not handed to them, chopped and ready to be fed. Once it looked like it was the right movie and the characters were introduced it got better. But then, towards the end, it got back to bad. The very end was just as bad as the beginning. Endings tend to be bad most of the time so I'm not pushing on that.As I read some reviews I came to the conclusion that you either hate or love this movie. Hate might be a harsh expression to what I thought but if I had to chose that would be my answer.",4,11,20,17 August 2012
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Everything you want in a movie - Transformers DOTM has it!
","When the first part of Transformers was released I wasn't interested in it. Robots transforming into cars? Seemed pretty weird to me. One day I decided to watch it anyway. Ever since I'm a big fan of Transformers and I cut down my prejudices on movies before actually watching them, they can turn out quite different from what you expect. Shortly after I watched part 1, part 2 came out and I watched that one at the movies. I liked it a lot even though many people thought it was bad or not fulfilling their expectations. But ever since I've seen Revenge of the Fallen I was excited for a part 3.After 2 years of waiting for Transformers: Dark of the Moon it finally was released and it blew up my excitement, in a really good way.I was skeptical after hearing Megan Fox would be replaced by the model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley because she had zero acting experience and was to play a big role as new girlfriend. I don't like her but she was really doing a good job. The whole acting was definitely great. It was also interesting to see Patrick Dempsey as the bad guy which he acted fantastic.To me the effects didn't overlay the story at all. They were great but didn't distract from the actual story. It had something conspiratorial, something funny, charming, there was action and romance, everything you could ask for. The storyline was brilliant, the old characters and the new ones were perfectly mixed together.There is not a single point where I'd say the movie was bad or boring, I enjoyed every single minute of it and can't give less than 10 stars. I can only say the same about the Soundtrack, every song of it is amazing! Just as the first two.It's definitely worth it to watch the movie and check out the Soundtrack.",10,2,5,2 July 2011
