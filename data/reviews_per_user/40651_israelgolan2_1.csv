The Avengers," Makes The Dark Knight Trilogy look like the inside of my butt
","'The Avengers' is a super-hero masterpiece. Marverl's idea of bringing together the Avengers to one motion picture was genius, and the execution was masterful. Joss Whedon's humor brings nothing but benefit to the already great story and action scenes. Of course, Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal of Tony Stark is certainly awesome, and Mark Ruffalo's Bruce Banner is the best I've seen so far. The most outstanding character is in fact the Hulk, and Whedon's humor shines best with him. The entire team eventually works together perfectly. The only minor flaws that are pointed out by certain critics are the lack of story and character establishment. However, because this is in fact a sequel to the five films, I believe that anyone who has seen 'Thor' will surely understand why Loki does seek domination over Earth. And it is also why I believe the characters are ones who have already been established in their own films, and 'The Avengers' is an all-out motion picture meant only to entertain. It does so indeed, is the best super- hero movie yet, and most likely will stay so for a long time.",10,5,11,7 June 2012
