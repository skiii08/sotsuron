Deja Vu," Worst and most unrealistic movie
","I don't even know where to start. This movie is so unrealistic, has so many plot flaws and is just generally very dumb.What is claimed to be a time machine in the movie is much more a camera that followed the people in the past. I mean how else could they be 'looking' at the past, if there was not a camera capturing the exact space and time at that particular moment, in that particular angle.Somehow, our hero survives the use of the dubious time machine, although, when previously used on animals, they died.I really cannot grasp how this movie achieves such a high ranking here. It is a really stupid movie, that's what it is. Apart from great acting and cinematography, this is the worst movie I have watched in a long time.",1,4,8,22 September 2015
