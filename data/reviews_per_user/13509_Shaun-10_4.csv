Antz," **** out of ****
","In my view, some of the best movies are those that show the viewer something from a never before seen world/existence.  This could be our world, just seen from a different perspective, or it could be an entirely new world, that we never even conceived could exist (like in one of my favorite films, 'Dark City').  Antz falls into the first category.The very first shot sets the tone of the film, when we see the shadowy outlines of what appear to be skyscrapers in the horizon, only to discover that they are merely blades of grass. After a terrific introduction to the lead character/ant Z, played by Woody Allen (in his best role to date that I have seen), the viewer is given a first look at the ant colony.  It is here that one sees the extremes to which the filmmakers have taken their technological advances.The creators took something as simple as an ant hill, and created an awe-inspiring visual tour-de-force.  Many people argue that 'A Bugs Life' was the superior film when it came out, but this opening shot tops anything you see in that film (not that that movie isn't fantastic as well).  The first half of Antz takes place inside of this world, with one exception (the termite war, which I'll go into later) but in the second half, the animators top themselves by taking Z and another ant, Princess Bala, out into our world.It is here that the film becomes, in essence, a computer animated, and vastly superior remake of 'Honey, I Shrunk the Kids.' Blades of grass tower over the ants, and drops of water can be fatal.  Eventually, they find themselves at a picnic (a fitting place for two ants to end up), and Z speaks one of my 2 favorite lines (I won't ruin it, but it involves the plastic wrapping around a sandwich).  Unfortunately, the biggest problem I had with the movie occurred during this, otherwise great scene.  Towering above the ants are various, giant forms of product placement, such as cans of Pepsi and Mountain Dew.  At this point, it feels like the movie has turned into a commercial.The climax to this scene involves the two ants stuck by gum to the bottom of a shoe.  Z's line right before they are released from the gum is the other of my 2 favorite lines.  The delivery is hilarious.In fact, the whole movie is hilarious.  As I stated earlier, there is a battle sequence between the ants and some termites (with the song 'The Ants Go Marching Home Again' triumphantly playing in the background) that, as expected, was truly fantastic.  The final conversation during this scene, between Z and another ant played be Danny Glover, is very unexpected, but highly humorous.  It was a terrific way to end the most intense part of the film (for a kid's movie).In short, this is not a film for everyone.  Many children will be bored, and I have talked to many people who did not have the same reaction I did. However, as far as I am concerned, this was one of the best films of 1998, and I was very upset when I found out it didn't get any Academy Award nominations.  But then again, many terrific films were ignored, while many mediocre films were heaped with nominations.After seeing a movie like this, I can only imagine what ground-breaking films we have to look forward to.  I only hope they can pull more off that are as good as this.",9,0,0,12 February 1999
The Princess Bride," ***1/2 out of ****
","The Princess Bride is a hilarious movie with some terrific, and very memorable dialogue.  The characters are original, funny, and genuinely clever, and while the storyline isn't the greatest out there, the style of the writing makes up for any plot problems.  This is a very entertaining movie, wittily directed by Rob Reiner, and I believe it would be very difficult not to really enjoy this film.",Null,1,2,26 February 1999
Life Is Beautiful," **** out of ****
","I must admit, I was a little uncertain about whether or not I wanted to see this film.  I'd heard it was terrific, but I didn't know if I liked the idea of reading a movie.  I had watched bits and pieces of foreign films on television, but I had never actually gone to see one in the theater.  I'm glad I did.  The subtitles were nowhere near as big a distraction as I feared; in fact, I completely forgot that they weren't speaking English approximately ten minutes into the film.  I don't know if that is a testament to this particular movie, or if it's simply a matter of my overestimating the difficulty of watching one.  Either way, no matter what language it was in, this was a terrific film.Written by, directed by, and starring Robert Benigni, Life Is Beautiful tells the story of a man with an incredible sense of humor, and how he uses this humor to overcome the horrors of the Holocaust.The first half of the movie is actually providing one of the longest introductions to a character that I have seen, showing backstory as to how the lead character, Guido, met his wife, and got her to fall in love with him through his humor. After this incredibly long, yet very funny setup, the movie flashes forward to the birthday of their young son, Joshua.It so happens that this is the day he and his son are forced to go to a concentration camp.  Using creativity and humor, Guido manages to convince his son that the entire thing (the concentration camp) is a game he arranged for his birthday, and this is the focus of the rest of the film; the challenge of convincing Joshua that the atrocities he sees around him are all in fun, and that everybody is having a great time.  There are times when Joshua starts to doubt that it's a game, or just wants to quit, and go home, but Guido is always able to convince him otherwise.The best scene in the movie involves Guido translating the rules of the concentration camp into the rules of the game for his son.  It's absolutely hilarious.  Which is something I never thought I'd say in a review for a movie dealing with the Holocaust.Not only does Benigi manage to find humor in the topic, he is able to create memorable and interesting characters as supporting players in the action. Of particular note is the character of a concentration camp doctor who used to be Guido's friend, and had a penchant for riddles (which were actually pretty good).All in all, this is a very surprising film.  The same premise could have been made into a terrible movie, but Benigni didn't downplay the seriousness of the subject; he just shows it from a different point of view.  Guido is an incredibly likeable character, and the efforts he goes to, in order to hide the truth from his son, are extraordinary to watch.  Whatever doubts anyone may have about seeing this film, simply because it is foreign, put these doubts aside and see it.  You'll be pleasantly surprised.",Null,1,2,18 February 1999
Pocahontas," ** out of ****
","One of my least favorite Disney animated films, Pocahontas suffers from a weak story, weak characters, and only mediocre animation.  The scenery is very good at times, but the people look terrible.  Not only that, this film commits one of the worst sins of an animated feature, and that is having an extraordinarily lame villain.  There is nothing menacing, or fearful about him at all.  He's just annoying.  On a more positive note, however, I do like several of the songs.  Despite this, having a decent soundtrack does not make up for the numerous problems with the film, and unfortunately, there are many.",Null,1,3,25 February 1999
