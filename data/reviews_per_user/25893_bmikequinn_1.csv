The Rock," How is this movie rated so highly?
","I don't understand how so many people can say this movie is great. I thought it was terrible. This is the kind of movie where cars blow up for no reason and create unrealistically huge fireballs. Not only that, but the dialogue is cheesy, with typical one liners like 'I'm too old for this.' The plot is reminiscent of one of the not as good seasons of 24, but not as developed. As stated by other users, the villain was the best part of the movie. Perhaps I'm biased because this movie had been hyped up to me for so many years, and when I finally watched it I was extremely disappointed. But regardless, the movie was bad (although there are plenty worse out there). I probably would have rated the movie lower, but it was entertaining enough that I was able to get through it, despite being tempted to turn it off several times.",4,4,7,1 September 2013
