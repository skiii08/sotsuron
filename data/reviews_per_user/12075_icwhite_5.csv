One Hundred and One Dalmatians," A Pure Disney Classic
","101 Dalmatians was a childhood favorite of mine, rewatched it just recently and still enjoyable. Some of the movie still gives me goosebumps like the Twilight Bark scene and some of the score, that's how you know when a movie is that good. The are some elements of the film that are a little bit dark, like Cruella De Ville's plan to skin the fur of dalmatian puppies for a new fur coat and the look of the De Ville place is creepily awesome. Other than that, it's still a good film to watch with the family, I truly recommend this movie to anyone who haven't seen it.",9,1,1,18 November 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," This Movie Will Rock You!
","A fantastic way to tell the story of Queen and Freddie Mercury. Some of it's heart wrenching, and some of it felt like a concert. If you're a Queen, music, or movie fan, than you will enjoy this masterpiece of the background story of Freddie Mercury and the band.",10,3,4,24 November 2018
Man of Steel," Man of Steel is my all time favorite film
","If you're a hardcore Superman fan like I am, I highly recommend for you to see this. The casting, cinematography, visual effects, directing, score, and story is amazing. Personally, this movie is the Holy Grail to all of film. If you love Superman, check out this film.",10,3,5,9 September 2018
Black Panther," Wakanda Forever!
","Had a lot of fun watching this film, action packed and Wakanda's culture is very interesting for a made up country. This one is up there with my favorites from the MCU, worth the watch.",9,2,5,9 September 2018
300," A Glorifying Bloodfest from Zack Snyder
","300 is an epic legendary tale of 300 Spartans fighting a million Persians. As a Zack Snyder fan myself, I was expecting to see this as a visionary amazement from what I've seen from Man of Steel, no disappointment what so ever from this film. If you're a Zack Snyder fan, Greek History, or a History fan in general, I would definitely give this film a watch.",10,1,2,13 October 2018
