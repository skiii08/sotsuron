Walk the Line," Incredible
","I took my Father to see this movie. I have always been a J Cash fan, but my Dad grew up with him. For him to say how amazed he was how well the portrayal way is a big 'thumbs up'. Dad said it best. 'Phoenix captured the real essence of the stage' It was like watching it all over again as a young man. My Father recently saw George JOnes live in concert; a thrill for him. He said watching this move gave his a similar nostalgic feeling. Most Bio-Pics are give and take. This will be picked apart just the same. It is a good story and worth the trip.I sometimes think the bio pic world will soon be flooded with imitations of 'RAY' and now 'Walk the Line'. If this does happen, we will have to adjust and look back at some of the best that started the trend.",9,1,5,21 November 2005
