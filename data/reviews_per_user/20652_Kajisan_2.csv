The Blair Witch Project," Worst movie ever?
","'Blair Witch' is one of those movies that either lives or dies on whether or not you're really, really scared of the things that go bump in the night. If rocks banging around, bundles of twigs hanging in trees, and unknown voices in the night are what freak you out, then maybe you really will be scared by what's happening here.  Still, the whole 'the most terrifying thing to the human mind is the unknown' is a little overplayed here, to say the least.  Hey, even in 'Jaws' we eventually got to see the shark.  This thing was made on a shoestring budget and it shows.  Why did they even bother to use 16mm when the best parts are on video?  Anyhow, blah, blah, blah, get ready for a disappointment, folks.  This thing probably would make a good five-minute campfire story, but for crying out loud, why make something that goes on for so long but, like our heroes, really doesn't go much of anywhere by the end?Having said this, sure, most of you are going to go see this movie anyhow. I can't even convince my friends not to.  But if you have any morals, at least buy a ticket for something else and sneak into 'Blair.'  This movie isn't worth the price of admission.",1,13,24,14 July 1999
Braveheart," It's good
","Well, here's one heck of a movie that Mr. Gibson's given to us all.  It should especially appeal to anyone in a lousy job who dreams of revolting against daily oppression.  You'll probably leave the theatre thinking your life will never be the same... but let's face it, it's only a movie and you'll be back to playing 'Metal Gear Solid' in a day and thinking maybe someday you'll get to that script you've always wanted to write.Still, it's a damn good movie.  Just make sure you see it widescreen.",9,1,2,14 July 1999
