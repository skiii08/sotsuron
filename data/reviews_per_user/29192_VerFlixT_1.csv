Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," What did I do, to deserve this?
",This film can proud itself by being one of the very few I left the theater just before the ending credits. I never expected much. I just wanted some nice hack 'n' slay stile 'Popcorn Kino'. But boy was I disappointed. There are so many flaws in the film. For example the very vital (pun intended) information that vampires react poorly to silver. The explanation is that old Judas and the silver tale. But why does it affect a vampire who is supposedly over 4000 years old? And were is the link from Judas to vampirism? If Judas was the first vampire (once again) that was agreeable but he isn't. A vampire can't kill another one? Therefore the fist of Lincoln's mentor is stopped some inches before he hits his own maker with the fist. Who vice versa is not hindered in any way later in the flick as he punishes his childe. Those are only the worst flaws which echo through my brain. There are more. They constantly knock on your synapses as you watch. Which you shouldn't. Trust me.,2,4,6,22 October 2013
