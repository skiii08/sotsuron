Antz," Uprising and revolutionary!
",A great animated film about non conformity and the underdog. A revolutionary kids film!,7,1,2,20 April 2018
Requiem for a Dream," A giant slap in the face to glamourised drug movies!
",A fascinating downward spiral of both socially inaccepted and socially acceptable drugs. This non-glamorous view to a world beyond anyone's choosing could never be accused of making narcotics of any kind appealing.,8,0,0,21 March 2018
The Equalizer," The quiet ones are the worst!
","Denzel Washington's, often slow delivery to his performances, suits this character perfectly. The quiet, nice guy, who's lifestyle is obsessively mundane and runs like clockwork, has a score to settle, with anyone who does wrong.Impressive action from Washington, a great build up, in general a real crowd pleaser",8,1,1,27 May 2019
The Equalizer," Not all servers of justice wear a cape or uniform!
","Not quite how I'd remembered the old series, but this a great revenge film and an enjoyable role from Washington.Compelling to the very end!",8,1,3,21 March 2018
Catch Me If You Can," The con man you just can't help but admire!
","Frank's life makes an interesting story of intelligence and fantasy combined. A great cat and mouse tale based on true events, that will have you entertained throughout",7,1,3,20 March 2018
It," The clown is back!
","Admittedly the length of the film feels more like 3 hours and could no doubt have been condensed to a shorter version. The highlights are the reminders of other Stephen King stories, such as stand by me and Carrie. Was it scary? It has its moments to shock, but ironically it's all based on what your fears are!Worthy of the watch.",7,0,1,5 April 2018
Rocketman," Creatively interpreted
","It will be inevitable that people will want to compare this film to Bohemian Rhapsody before they see it, because of the timing, but they are two very different films.Rocket man is essentially a musical with serious moments captured in a creative interpretation.Perhaps not groundbreaking in new information, but perhaps mid-information.I will never hear the songs quite the same way again",8,3,5,16 June 2019
Captain Marvel," Entertaining!
","I've not seen every marvel, so I completely get that I'm missing some connections here. The 3D effects were enjoyable and the film as a whole pretty watchable. With an empty theatre, I seemed to be aware of where the audience should have been laughing, but left a bit of a tumble weed moment here and there.",6,1,9,23 March 2019
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," The feel good factor comedy
","A film I just can't help returning to, I love Jason Segal, his depeessive wit in this film is guaranteed to bring smiles and laughter.Russell brand, playing a characature of himself and a good supporting cast, even the synics of romantic comedies can root for this one.",8,4,5,19 August 2018
12 Monkeys," How do you take someone serious who claims they are from the future?
","Whilst the literal parts of this film are slightly dated now, the information is probably more relating in today's world than ever. My favourite Bruce Willis film and whatever happened to Madeline Stowe?",7,0,1,21 March 2018
12 Angry Men," A cleverly plotted oldie, with a modern day relevance
","Script cleverly written to include all members of the jury and bring their own perspectives to the case. When a man's life hangs in the hands of twelve men, it's up to them to cover all bases.",8,0,1,16 March 2018
Hostel," Gorefest!
","Watching all these years later, Hostel doesn't seem to be so shocking and controversial as it once was, but it still packs a punch.Most certainly worthy of a watch for the non squeamish, the acting isn't of a great standard, but that's not the reason for watching!",7,0,2,16 April 2018
Madagascar," Enjoyable family fun
",Family fun with some great characters and personalities.,7,1,1,13 May 2018
Hot Fuzz," A West Country action film !
","The film that has received more viewings from me than any other film. Perhaps being a West Country girl, I love the area of its filming and the over exaggerated dialogue. Simon Pegg is a comedy genius and this is his comedy masterpiece, paired again with Nick Frost, everything has been thrown in to the plot, with plenty of laughs and famous faces.",9,0,0,26 March 2018
Home Alone," The best mischievous movie!
","An absolute classic!Familiar to everyone, McCulkin's most well known film which is still fun with every watch. The gimmicks, the voices, the wet bandits! Feel good viewing !",8,0,1,22 May 2018
Deadpool 2," He's back!
","I just couldn't wait for this to be released and although there are a few scenes where it doesn't quite live up to the first, up comes the familiar humour that is unique to Ryan Reynolds. I came away from the first with a few new phrases and I've come away from the second with some chuckle inducing nuggets too.",8,4,13,16 May 2018
Yes Man," A great feel good movie!
","An uplifting movie that's easy watching and thought provoking! Reminders of an earlier Carey in Liar Liar when it comes to this one, some very typical Jim Carrey moments, but with lots of new ideas.",8,0,0,9 April 2018
Snatch," 20 years on and still a great watch!
","A film I revisit at least once a year, the intertwining stories, the hierarchy of criminals, the simplistic, dark, comical dialogue and recognisable faces, make this a true Brit classic!",9,2,3,22 March 2020
Pan's Labyrinth," Like no other fairy tale you've seen!
","This dark gritty fairytale needs your dedicated attention! A story of power, uprising and determination told through a harsh, violent and cold reality with plenty of symbolic gestures.",8,1,1,19 May 2018
Taxi Driver," One of the major films on any geek/buff list!
","I love De Niro and I love Scorsese! Taxi driver is one of the older classics that seems a little overrated in the first half, but is busy building toward a climatic eruption.It's pretty amazing to know just how young Jodie Fister was in her role considering what and who she was portraying.Does it still feel like an iconic film? I feel it was a film that represented the place and the time, it's pretty offensive to everyone, but also very perceptive for its time in terms of the escalation of Travis Bickle.Psychotic or hero? Conspiracist or truth seeker? Crime stopper or crime creator?",8,0,0,16 May 2018
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Deep, funny, impressive!
","So pleasantly surprised with this film. Friends have been making recommendations since it's release, more serious than I imagined, a pretty deep film, which is made so by Great performances from both Frances McDormand and Sam Rockwell! There are elements of comedy in the darkness, but a powerful and unique film.",9,1,3,24 March 2018
Forrest Gump," Simplicity!
","Forrest Gump is both a genius and oblivious to his over achieving, a simple attitude to life, a stripped back soul who just is!Quirky story telling, naturally acted, one mans adventures and influences with a huge capacity for love.One of the most re-watchable 90's classics!",8,0,1,17 January 2019
Gone Baby Gone," Thought provoking!
","Gone baby gone is a great film that takes a long of sticking with, the acting is very believabable and the feeling of the film is intense throughout. It's one of the films that's a once time viewing rather than a returner, but an impressive role by Casey Affleck and a good watch",8,2,3,31 March 2018
21 Jump Street," One of my favourite comedies!
","Who would have thought Channing Tatum would be the perfect comedy partner to Jonah Hill?Some really funny scenes throughout the film, that have made it one of my most watched films of all time",8,1,1,20 May 2018
Nightcrawler," Ratings v's conscience!
","A totally unique storyline with another great role for Jake Gyllenhaal, brings into perspective what goes on behind the scenes of our daily news and what it takes to gain access!",Null,0,1,15 April 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," Wow!!!! This film was made for the big screen!!!
","I almost missed out on seeing this on the big screen and that would have been such a shame!Very few films warrant a 10 star rating, but I couldn't deny that everything about this film drew me in.Firstly performances all round were so believable. Secondly the story itself allowed itself to be told from an imperfect, yet respectful angle. Thirdly, if the music of Queen wasn't contagious enough, the process behind the lyrics and the music, bring new meaning. Fourthly, there are some great artistic camera shots throughout, fifly, the dimensions of Freddy are much more intimate from a non press perspective and with it more emotive and finally feeling part of a crowd and part of the story is a true high.I can see this being a film to revisit many times!",10,11,16,27 February 2019
American Psycho," Cold, soulless and strangely compelling!
","In a material world, where everything can be bought and ego drives humans to be disconnected and competitive, where drugs no longer reach that high and human life has little value, the disguise is slipping and the hunger for the thrill is at it's peak. It's not a typical serial killer film, it's quirky, almost arty and is probably appreciated more on its second viewing.",7,0,1,5 April 2018
Wanted," An assassin like no other!
","At the time of this film release, James McAvoy wasn't what I would have thought of as Action/Assassin material, but that's the point right there! Great visual effects and a really enjoyable storyline. Definitely a favourite!",8,2,3,28 May 2018
Warrior," redictable, but physically impressive!
","Another transformational role for Hardy, who takes on a physical challenge of being a fighter with an animalistic toughness, that covers the sensitivity of a small boy.Whilst Warrior is pretty predictable and comparable to many other fighting films, it's still one to watch!",7,0,0,22 February 2019
Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa," Easy watching ...
","A few stolen moments from Lion King, but identity plays its role in Madagascar 2! A worthy sequel, but doesn't live up to the first.",7,1,1,5 June 2018
Shrek Forever After," Forget all you know about the first 3 ...
","Possibly one too many Shrek installments, should've stopped at three, but is still worthy of a watch. It seems to go off on a sideways tangent, which has a moral, but doesn't quite fit with the others.",6,1,2,23 June 2018
Bad Teacher," Just a fun, easy watcher!
","It's sunday and this typically a good film to stick on, a light, no brainier, easy watching, predictable comedy",7,2,4,17 June 2018
Now You See Me," Must see Action Thriller!
","Hooked from the very beginning, reminders of both The Illusionist and Oceans Eleven spring to mind. A unique heist movie, that is highly entertaining!",8,0,1,27 March 2018
American History X," Powerful!
","A very powerful film of ignorance and hate and the origin of where it is bred. A fantastic and harsh role for Edward Norton who's appearance in the film is so far from his usual softer self. One of the films that tends to be on everyone's great films list. Thought provoking, cringeworthy subject matter, but reflects a harsh reality of life.",9,1,3,19 April 2018
Batman Begins," Re-visit
","I'm not sure I enjoyed this too much the first time around, a darkened version of what we knew to be a colourful, fantasy franchise, but a revisit and a chance to readjust, was worthy and made for a good first instalment.Loved the training part, reminders of old martial arts movies from long ago.Now looking for forward to more re-visits and understanding more of the background to these characters.",7,0,0,13 November 2019
Bridesmaids," Romantic comedy minus the soppy bits!
","I never enjoyed romantic comedies until they started making them like this! Filled with laughing out loud moments and a great addition of Chris O'Dowd, this is most definitely a must see movie for male or females!",8,1,2,1 April 2018
Non-Stop," Nothing new!
","Whilst the film is watchable, Non Stop really offers no thing new to the airplane crisis type films.",6,0,2,11 May 2018
Legend," Brilliance doubled!
","The fascination about the infamous Gangsters, is that they were so alike. Hardy manages to take on both roles and bring to life (instead) the differences in the twins. The loyalty, the liabilities, the business minds, the brutality. Prison, mental institutions all covered in everything ever written about the Krays, but this film digs that little bit deeper and that is down to Hardy's interpretations.",8,0,1,16 March 2018
Gone Girl," The most original Thriller in a long time!
","A slow moving yet genius story line, with everything you would, and should expect from a good psychological Thriller.A lengthily film, but worthy of every building moment.It's unique story will stay with you and go down as one of the most memorable Thrillers you will have ever seen.",9,1,1,30 August 2017
The Theory of Everything," Truly Inspiring!
","A truly mesmerising performance from Eddie Redmayne, who must have studied every detail to honour the now, late Stephen Hawking.Such an insight into his relentless attitude in the face of adversity, with humour kept intact, it truly proves into some of the most private matters of his life story.",8,0,0,21 March 2018
The Lion King," Probably the best 3D film to date
","There is no other way to watch this, but in 3D! What also added to the opening scene for me, was completing the Serengeti series yesterday evening, which relates so well.The scenes are spectacular, the movements of all animals and actor choices for all characters, I'm sure will go unchallenged. More emphasis on already popular songs, but a wow moment on 'wimaway'.A nostalgic classic, refurbished and brought up to date, can't fail to enjoy!",9,0,4,9 August 2019
A Quiet Place," Predator meets sSigns
","Admittedly anything with creatures in, tend not to be my type of film, but a fiends choice.Be prepared to eat your popcorn quietly! The film is very quiet, then pretty jumpy, hence it's title. Communication is through sign language and subtitles are provided. As a result, you get to experience what it may feel like in a non hearing world, which is really quite clever.The film length isn't too long, I feel the writer and director could have milked this and dragged it out, I'm glad they didn't. If you're gonna watch this, do so at the cinema for full effect.",6,0,1,2 May 2018
22 Jump Street," Hilarious!
","Just when you think sequels are all about doing the same with a bigger budget... well ... along comes 22 Jump Street. As funny as the first, if not better in many parts. You may have to be of a certain age to appreciate the ice cube references, but this duo will undoubtedly give you the gigs!",8,1,2,27 May 2019
Unknown," Plenty of action!
","An enjoyable film from start to finish, twists and turns and plenty of action, similarities to a Harrison Ford film, if I recall correctly.",8,1,1,6 May 2018
Shrek the Third," Another few additions!
","Another adventure with Shrek and the gang with more additional characters, easy wstching, probably the weakest of the three so far, but still enjoyable and always great artists on the sound track",7,4,5,8 June 2018
Back to the Future Part III," Western style!
","Not as good as the first two, but still a fun way Watch!",6,1,2,2 May 2018
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," One hell of an investigation!
","The first of the trilogy introduces our controversial characters that leads to an interesting case.Very well acted, hooked from the beginning, hard hitting and satisfying!If you only watch a few sub-titled movies in your lifetime, make one of them this one!",9,0,0,24 May 2018
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Once seen, never forgotten!
","The simplistic tale of a friendship between two boys in a grown up world of hate, separation and control. Where war and dictation chooses your friends and foes, but untainted views, show a briefness of peace.Emotional and beautiful in equal measure. Just wow!",9,3,5,23 July 2018
Shrek 2," Perhaps the best of all
","Even better than the first, new characters introduced, a nice ce follow up story, milking greatly the fairy tale theme.",8,0,0,14 May 2018
Prisoners," Every parents worst nightmare!
","A film to bring every kind of emotion to its rawest level, some amazing performances, from pretty much an all star cast. Suspenseful, debatable and realistically horrific!A must watch for those who enjoy actor driven gritty ness!",9,1,1,24 August 2019
Prisoners," Jackman is phenomenal!
","An intense film with a most memorable powerhouse performance from Hugh Jackson. The best acted film I've seen in a long while, gripping to the very end!A must see!",9,1,1,4 April 2018
Big Fish," Happy, unique and imaginative.
","Big fish is an utterly unique film and such a feel tale. A colourful imagination makes the world a huge place of adventure, allows for indulgent story telling and injects brightness into the mundane.",8,0,1,4 May 2018
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Bizarre, addictive, mind bending!
","Eternal sunshine is a mind twisting filmthat leaves you questioning future possibilities. There is something quite addictive about this film that will require many revisits. I love this side to Jim Carrey and with a whole array of other big names, this film is a must see!",9,0,0,28 March 2018
Sinister," Interesting angle!
","Sinister has a new different approach to a Horror film, in that its a little more reality based, but with supernatural add-ins.Visually it's pretty dark and a little hard to make out at times, but it works and is worthy of a viewing!",8,0,0,22 April 2018
Reservoir Dogs," 28 years old???? How scary!
","Still one of my most revisited films. Told in Typical Tarantino style, Violence, over the top dialogue, a great soundtrack, actors that are later recycled for future projects and back n forth storytelling.Iconic, brilliant and everything Tarantino!",8,0,0,25 March 2020
Inside Man," Like no other bank robbery movie!
","A clever bank robbery which is plot driven, with a great ending. A good role for Clive Owen who plays his charter cool and controlled. Denzel is Denzel, but the film is entertains to the very end",8,3,5,27 March 2018
Pulp Fiction," Tarantino's masterpiece!
","To be a teen in the height of the Tarantino years left me with multiple watches through many age perspectives. known controversially at the time for the level of violence in his films, it overshadowed the unique directing skills of Quentin Tarantino.Pulp fiction has many of the great hallmarks besides the violence, over indulgent quotable dialogue, the individual characters and backgrounds, the broken pattern of storytelling, an all star cast, the revival of careers, the iconic soundtrack. Don't watch it once, watch it over and over!",9,0,0,31 March 2018
Les Misérables," The biggie!!!
","As a die hard fan of Les Amis since it was released 31 years ago, I had only two complaints about this film, they were Russell Crow and Sacha Baron Cohen! Having been used to the likes of Philip Quast and Alun Armstrong, they failed to meet the expectations of the character for me.The rest of the film allowed for the upmost respect to all original casts and in particular the cameo role for Colm Wilkinson.The sets were beyond expectation and some of the songs like 'Lovely ladies' seemed to have even more emotion poured in to them.A powerhouse of a film, that did little harm to the die hard fans.",9,1,1,7 April 2018
Mystic River," One of my favourites!
","Mystic River isn't just a whodunnit, it's a crime that effects the town and it's past. With excellent performances from an all star cast, probably Sean Penn's best performance ever.It's a dark mood kinda film, but certainly one of a kind!",9,0,0,17 May 2018
A Beautiful Mind," A beautiful story
","Based on a true story the thin lines of genius and madness, make this film an intriguing watch.A great performance from Crowe which came across well in the complexities of the role he plays. For all the beautiful minds!",8,1,2,14 April 2018
Psycho," Where it all began!
","I've recently finished watching Bates Motel and it's great to look back to this film for the original reference. Probably Hitchcock's best known film and icon for the 'shower' scene. Perkins superbly convinced the audience of his calm easy going, mama's boy persona. Hitchcock was never afraid to explore the taboo or lightly delved into",8,0,0,18 July 2018
Burlesque," Show me how to Burlesque!
","Burlesque is all about a cheesy storyline and cheesy acting, but for those who love song and dance and have dipped their toe into the world of burlesque, you will appreciate for the entertainment value!",7,1,1,17 April 2018
Jaws," An absolute classic!
","I was among the generation of which one of my first scary films was Jaws. It still, to this day has a good element of suspense in those two notes that becomes faster and faster during crucial moments.",8,0,2,1 May 2018
The Shawshank Redemption," One of the best films ever ...
","It's a beautiful story of friendship, disguised against the cruel backdrop of prison life.Emotional, harsh and pure genius!Should be oneverybodies must see list!",9,0,0,15 April 2018
Back to the Future Part II," Where we're going ...
","I think the second is better than the first, itd more complex, with the now, the present, past and future, the double ups and the split timelines, make for entertaing viewing!",8,1,2,1 May 2018
Shrek," An animation must!
","A nice little revisit to where it all began, such a clever move, using fairy tale creatures which encourages the franchise to go on and on. Whilst it will remain a timeless classsic, there are some moments that were very popular at that time, like the wrestling that was encorporated into the tale. For the first time ever, I noticed that the scrolls had a blue 'f' on them like Facebook.Not your typical fairy tale!",8,2,2,9 May 2018
The Silence of the Lambs," Chillingly brilliant!
","My absolute favourite film of all time. Whilst I doubt that there are any people left who haven't seen this film, this has all the ingredients of how a good psychological thriller is made.Of course there is Anthony Hopkins, sinister? Intellectual performance of Dr. Hannibal Lector, but easily forgotten is Ted Levine's Buffalo Bill.The games, the torments add to this being there at the top, even though it is aging now",10,1,3,20 March 2018
Black Panther," There is clearly something people are seeing that I don't!
","It's easier to bear with the start of the movie, because that's where you get the origin of the Black Panther, the cultural values and the James Bond style accessories, but it continues at a snails pace with very little humour.I expected this film to have at least been 'watchable' but this is my second movie to have been walked out on in the cinema.Reminders of many other films, perhaps I missed the best bits? I made over an hour!",4,7,12,16 April 2018
Bruce Almighty," What if God was one of us?
","I think every time I rewatch a Jim Carrey movie, particularly this one, I come away with the deeper meaning beneath the comedy. Truly reflective of all of us, with the humour that is unique to JC!! This is a light, fun film for all",8,2,2,3 April 2018
The Greatest Showman," Not what I was expecting, but ...
","The film was so big, everyone talking about it, hearing the songs being played and copied, gave me an already familiar feel of what this film was going to be like and yet, I enjoyed even more than expected!It's imperfection is it's appeal and the songs bring new meaning when you understand the feelings behind them.One to be watched over and over !!!",8,0,1,27 May 2019
Identity," Unpredictable makes for great viewing!
","Not a particularly well acted film, despite the big named cast, oh but there is something quite great about this film when watching for the first time. Certainly unique at its time of release.",8,1,3,20 March 2018
Final Destination," Teen terror!
","Stay away if your worse fear is flying!A pretty good (tense at timed) story, worthy of a watch, easy viewing!",7,0,0,14 April 2018
Deadpool," This one's a keeper!
","Dead pool instantly became One of those films that will weren't many watches. Defying the usual make up of a comic book, super hero type, Reynolds delivery of his lines (although with added immaturity) gave laughter pretty much from start to finish.Totally character driven, I can only hope the sequel lives up to this one.",9,1,3,16 March 2018
Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted," Leave the best to last!
","Possibly my favourite of the three, by now characters are well established, we've gone from the zoo to the wild and now the circus, which nicely draws to a concluding instalment.",7,1,2,9 June 2018
Back to the Future," A timeless classic!
","What appears to be quite fun and simple a film on the surface, is a much more complicated storyline, if you sit and work out the complexities of time travel surrounding the storyline.Many quotable lines, the best remembered film of Michael J Fox and a film that has followed me from childhood to adulthood.",8,1,1,22 April 2018
Goodfellas," If you watch one gangster movie, make it this one!
","Probably the best gangster movie ever made, partly because it's based on a true story, but also because it's faster moving than some and has a great cast.The film marks the peak of the Scorsese/De Niro collaboration and gave Liotta his best remembered role.A must see on anyone's list!",9,0,1,21 March 2018
Cinderella Man," Crowe and Howard, a dream combination!
","A hearty film, that's so much more than the boxing. Tough times se a drive for one man's fight for his family.A fantastic performance from Russell Crowe and a fight scene to take all fight scenes.This is how a film of a true story is made, with a feeling of authenticity, in honour of and respectful to the details of the life of, a Ron Howard great!",8,1,1,20 June 2018
The Wizard of Oz," Lions and tigers ...
","Who doesn't know this film? The classic tale of Dorothy and friends and their extroidinary journey along the yellow brick road. A bright, fun filled story, complete with a moral.",7,0,2,17 April 2018
Law Abiding Citizen," Revenge is a dish ..,
",Think modern day 'Death Wish' with more mind games and more visual brutality.A great role for Gerrard Butler and a must watch ch for revenge me vie fans,7,0,1,7 April 2018
The Island," Easy watching and thought provoking!
","An easy way ching film, which has a matrix style feel to and has been added to the list of my 'awakening' films. One of those films where you can take it for what it is or look deeper into the meaning and metaphor. An interesting futuristic thought!!",7,1,1,23 March 2018
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," A Coen classic!
","Much like other Coen Bro's films, it's a love it or hate it, kinda piece. George Clooney's character is probably much different to the usual roles he takes on, which adds to the laughter and quirky ness of the film.A lovely, easy watching, comedy, with some fun music and plenty of smiles.",7,0,0,28 March 2018
