National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Lame Disney, family-rated, archaeology mystery adventure film
","Something like a cross between the Da Vinci Code and Raiders of the Lost Arc, although not too scary or anything. Nicholas Cage is Ben Gates, a rich guy who likes to give talks about his historical interests. After giving a lecture about the Lincoln assassination, a chiselled figure, Mitch Wilkinson, appears with a missing page from diary of John Wilkes Booth which appears to implicate Ben Gates' ancestors as a co-conspirator in the assassination. To prove his great great grandfather's innocence, Gates sets out on an adventure which follows a set of clues which ultimately lead to a search for the fabled 'City of Gold'. Fortunately Gates' best friend is an electronics wizard which enables them to bypass security measures and have convenient access to highly guarded areas such as Buckingham Palace and the Oval Office of the White House. Even more convenient, other family members know extinct languages and can read ancient runes. A Love interest tags along and Mitch Wilkinson reveals himself as a bad guy who is trailing Gates, hoping to grab any loot they may uncover. Geared toward an audience with a low attention span, the pace is fast and they don't get stuck on difficult clues for long. Ludicrous plot probably wouldn't prevent this film from succeeding as a Saturday morning TV adventure for preteens. Trevor Rabin soundtrack seems apt.",3,0,0,14 May 2010
Gone Baby Gone," Unexceptional abducted baby drama
","In a tough inner city Boston neighborhood, the child of an arguably unfit mother goes missing. Contacted by the child's aunt to supplement the police investigation, young, pint-sized but tough Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) is asked to help with the search. Kenzie, along with his partner/girlfriend, Angie, demonstrates his mettle as he conducts his street level investigation in run down bars full of uncooperative misfits and scum-of-the-earth. Although striving to be dark and complex, the film is more memorable for its stupid plot twists and, in any case, still includes the expected abducted baby drama clich√©s. The audience is supposed to be caught up in the moral dilemmas faced by the hero, but the story is so unlikely, by the end of the film these situations cannot be regarded very seriously. Some credit for the portrayal of local people in this tough Boston neighborhood, many of whom seem genuinely frightening and contemptible.",4,18,34,4 June 2008
