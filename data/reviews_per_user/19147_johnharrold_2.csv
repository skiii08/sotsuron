The New World," The New World is pretty.
","The New World is beautifully filmed. It will probably become a great date movie, a chick flick in the genre of 'Settlers and Indians'. If this film had been made 15 years ago, Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan might have starred in it. However, aside from the scenery, my opinion is that the Disney version is much more interesting.I think that it would be more credible, not politically correct, if someday filmmakers chose Native American actors to portray Native Americans. In this film, Q'Orianka Kilcher, whose father (according to IMDb) is a Quechua Indian from South America, portrays Pocahontas. Her mother is a native Swede from Alaska.I predict that many people are going to like this movie, but I would rather see one about the Lewis and Clark Expedition. There is much more of a story there. That would make a good mini-series too.On the other hand, why not re-work the Pocahontas story so that it takes place in outer space. I do not have a problem with miscast space aliens.",5,1,7,2 January 2006
Walk the Line," Blah
","The actors do not look like...or sound like...the people that they are portraying. I was bored from the the start until I stopped watching it after, on or about, 45 minutes. This movie is a testimony to the masses' craving for mediocrity. I am a fan of the Johnny and June Carter Cash. The film, Angels with Angles, has a tremondous performance by Frank Gorshin. He portrays George Burns flawlessly. It is too bad that Gorshin was not part of a well publicized film like Walk the Line, or that Burns-mania is not currently a trend. Angels with Angles is not very good...but Gorshin is. If they are going to hand out award nominations to actors portraying iconic dead people..then Gorshin should have been nominated.",1,9,28,3 February 2006
