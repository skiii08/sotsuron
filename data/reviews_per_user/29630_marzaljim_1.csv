Vertigo," Recently saw it on the big screen
","I must say that if you have a chance to see it at the theater, you absolutely must! All of the street scenes in and around Sam Francisco come to life, details that you miss on your home screen. The colors and images are so detailed and vivid it mesmerizes. It's especially delicious if you've ever been to San Francisco and San Juan Batista. The scene at Ernie's gives you an appreciation of fine dining in another era. All the men are in formal or semi-formal dress and the ladies in elegant evening gowns. The super-imposed scenes are also more evident, such as the scene at the lone cypress on the coast, show how Hitchcock wanted perfection in a scene, even when he has a perfect location.",10,2,3,19 September 2006
