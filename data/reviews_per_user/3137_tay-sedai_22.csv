Requiem for a Dream," Amazing but a one-view film
","I guess I had to give this movie 10 stars, even though I've only ever seen it once and never intend to watch it again. I think that it was a brilliant movie in every way. Okay, maybe not the way of 'entertaining me and making me happy', but in every OTHER way, yes.I actually haven't seen this movie since it came out back in 2001, which is when I saw it at the cinema. I saw it then and it's a movie that I really remember quite well, even if I only remember particular scenes most vividly. There are some movies I saw a year ago that I couldn't remember if you told me to describe something about them, or even who was in them. Requiem is not such a movie - it's definitely memorable even if for horrible reasons.I guess it's a bit like those other movies, Kids and A Clockwork Orange - I saw them once and never want to see them again, but I also know they were great films, or at the very least seminal and unforgettable works for their time.",10,1,2,1 June 2013
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," A great movie ... but I need to watch it again.
","First up, I will say I have not yet read the book - even though somehow I have ended up with two different editions of it on my bookshelves. But I'm pretty sure that even when I eventually do, I won't change my mind about the movie being a great one.I didn't know what to expect when I first saw it, but I wasn't expecting the dark aspect that was revealed later in the movie. All the actors did an outstanding job in this one.Definitely recommended, including to myself because a rewatch is in order to refresh my memory.",9,0,0,4 May 2020
Resident Evil: Afterlife," Not too bad, not too awesome
","I think these movies are getting more and more 'filler' with each installment. That doesn't mean I don't enjoy watching them, though, and I can definitely see myself re-watching them in future. But I wouldn't say that they're right up there with my top favourite films or anything.I look at this movie and compare it to the first, and see a marked difference. This one is more action, CGI, while the original is almost art-house in some ways.I enjoy the combo of Ali Larter and Milla Jovovic...and may I just say that Wentworth Miller is definitely worth viewing anytime! But all in all I would say this movie was just a bit 'eh', overall.",6,1,3,1 June 2013
Resident Evil: Extinction," Some very epic moments
","I just finished watching this one for the first time, and I have to say there were quite a few moments when my jaw fell open. Those are the 'epic moments' I refer to in the review title, and namely are the moments when Alice first shows up at the survivor 'camp' and roasts a few birds, and naturally the scene where we see who Alice's 'one woman army' consists of.This was a good cast, as I am a definite Ali Larter fan (she's another who does well in 'kick-arse heroine' roles. It was sad, because some of the survivors of the previous movie didn't make it out of this one, but I guess that seems to be a bit of a tradition of these movies! Anyway, I really enjoyed this one, even the zombie birds (ew), and look forward to watching #4.After that, I guess I'll have to wait #5!",7,2,2,26 May 2013
Cast Away," Definitely a favourite
","Cast Away stars Tom Hanks and, more importantly, a very special volleyball, a.k.a. my beloved Wilson. I love this movie because it's dramatic and inspiring but also because it's not utterly swamped down with swells of dramatic music. In fact, the whole time Hanks's character is on the island, there is no music, and this actually has a profound and unique effect. Don't get me wrong, I love a good soundtrack, but sometimes I think that there is definite overkill with music in scenes that don't necessarily need it.I loved seeing the slow, forced transformation of Hanks's character throughout the movie. He went from sort of chubby, overworked and neglectful of his health to this hardened survivor with a huge, bushy beard. He even has to knock his own abscessed tooth out on his own, when back home he had the opportunity to go to the dentist and have painkillers and do it the 'easy' way.The only spot where some people feel this movie fell down was the ending, where Hanks's character makes it back to the US and his true love. But to be honest I think the ending was great. I don't believe it was an overdone Hollywood ending, and it also gave me hope for Hanks's character's future. It helps that he didn't get back with his love, because she had moved on with a family of her own. I actually found it quite wrenching.All in all, I think this is a really well done movie. And I still love Wilson.",9,7,9,21 May 2013
Resident Evil," Pretty good
","I have taken ages to re-watch this movie, because for some reason I remembered it as being really scary and disturbing. Which is weird because I am fine with watching scary movies. But anyway, I just re-watched it and found it entertaining and exhilarating. And having finished watching it, I also realised that I had not yet seen any of the subsequent movies (for some reason I thought I had).Anyway, of course Milla Jovovich is a rockin' chick when it comes to action movies, but I love Michelle Rodriguez as well. I guess this movie was a pretty extreme action movie 'cause, well, let's just say it's very casualty-heavy!I remember liking the sound of the soundtrack, too, but I haven't actually explored what's on it.",7,2,3,26 May 2013
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Not bad
","I wouldn't call this a brilliant movie, but it certainly kept me watching from start to finish. Michelle Rodriguez's character is replaced by another kick-arse heroine to work alongside Jovovich's Alice. There's also a new super-evil dude to contend with. Naturally the biggest baddies of all are the people who work for the Umbrella corporation! And, man, those zombie dogs are just freaky!In this movie we get to know a bit more about how the T-Virus came to be, and get a new perspective on how it can be used for good and not just bad. Naturally, though, it's mostly all bad!As usual, there's a lot of action and a lot of death. And the Umbrella Corporation sure is good at twisting the facts of the truth. I'm intrigued to know what happens next.So I'm ready to watch movie #3.",7,13,16,26 May 2013
Into the Wild," Depressing and yet beautiful
","Here is what I wrote after first seeing this movie:Mum and I went to the movies last night to see this movie called Into the Wild. I believe it's the one that Eddie Vedder did all (or a lot of) the music for. It had some absolutely stunning cinematography but it was extremely sad. Mum and I didn't realise it'd be quite so depressing.Still, I'd definitely recommend it.It wasn't the sort of depressing that A Clockwork Orange or Requiem for a Dream were, so don't worry. :)****So, yeah, that's what I thought after first viewing this movie. I don't remember it all that clearly but I do remember feeling stunned when the end of the movie came and we realised it was actually going to end that way.A tragic story, but a wonderful production.",9,0,2,1 June 2013
Total Recall," Love the cheesy goodness
","This movie came out in 1990, when I was 10. Or I might have been 9, depending on what time of year it was. I don't now if i saw it at the movies or if we waited till it was on video (yeah, VIDEO back then), but either way I loved this movie from the first moment I saw it.I am actually quite a fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger as an actor, even if some people think he's not all that talented. I think it's because a lot of his best-known movies are straight out of my childhood and teen years, so he gave me a lot of entertainment back in the day! Total Recall is definitely one of my favourites. It never fails to make me laugh when I re-watch it, and I love the concept as well. The film focuses on some interesting notions, i.e. human memory and what might happen in a world where you can buy false memories. The story makes you wonder what was real and what wasn't. So, all in all I find it a thought-provoking movie as well as being cheesy and silly.I don't see it as the most genius film of all time, so I'm only giving it an 8 - particularly as I don't re-watch it THAT often, whereas there are other movies I will re-watch at least every 6 months. But it's in my DVD collection and it's there to stay!",8,0,1,21 May 2013
Rocky," A good surprise
","I only saw Rocky for the first time recently, after getting access to Netflix. I know it's been on TV recently and that's partly why I wanted to watch the full movie when I saw it on Netflix. I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was.I know since watching this movie that I had been missing at least one important 'cultural reference' that you wouldn't get until you've seen Rocky - that is, him yelling out 'AAaadriaaan!' which is also a quote in the first Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie (which I also love ;) ).Stallone's character was surprisingly interesting to me and I thought he was a real sweetie. I found the story compelling too. As other reviewers have mentioned, it's much more than just a boxing movie. I really enjoyed the fact that he went after a girl who was, let's face it, quite dowdy and not your typical love interest in any Hollywood movie. I thought their love story was really sweet, though I could relate to Adrian not wanting to watch him get beaten up in the fight!One other thing to love about this movie is the classic theme song, too. And I finally got to see what that guy was talking about when I visited Philadelphia as a teenager - the steps Rocky ran up. That was back in 1997 that I saw those steps - I'm glad I finally know what that reference was about!I haven't seen any of the others as yet, but I know they're available on Netflix. I have a feeling they won't be quite as good as the first, just like I prefer the first Lethal Weapon movie to all the others I've seen.",8,2,2,11 December 2015
Joker," Brilliance
","I expected this movie to be amazing before seeing it, simply because it stars Joaquin Phoenix, one of the most brilliant actors of his time and any time. I wasn't disappointed - this movie was captivating from start to finish.There were moments when I wanted to look away because of the cringe factor - but overall what I felt was creeped out (the movie is full of suspense, like you're holding your breath all the time wondering what will happen next), horrified, enthralled, furious (at the societal injustices that sometimes trigger already 'different' people to become twisted), and exhilarated (like, with that ending sequence of scenes).If you haven't seen this one already, and aren't looking for something 'fluffy' to sink into, then I highly recommend this movie.",10,1,1,15 April 2020
The Lion King," Great, timeless masterpiece
","The Lion King is probably still my favourite Disney movie, though I love most of them that I've seen. But The Lion King has real sentimental value for me. I saw it in high school and quickly became obsessed. The irony is that a lot of the time my friends and I were more obsessed with this little movie they showed before the feature (It was about a little sheepish lion called Lambert. We sang the Lambert song more than any actual Lion King song).Anyway, what do I love about The Lion King? Well, the music for a start. Combining that with the beautiful, sweeping visuals and you have a fair few eye-prickling moments (you know, prickling with unshed tears?). The story is sad but has its happy moments. The soundtrack is amazing - recently I saw Elton John live and he played 'Circle of Life', which gave my friend and I both major goosebumps, but Hans Zimmer is the main genius here - and the animation is fabulous.This film is timeless.",10,0,0,21 May 2013
Music and Lyrics," Ahh, the 80s
","Although this movie wasn't actually set in the 80s, it certainly had moments that people who loved music in the 80s could appreciate. I guess in a way it's just another Hugh Grant rom com (as well as another Drew Barrymore rom com), but that doesn't mean it wasn't enjoyable. I found it entertaining and, I guess, a little heart-warming.My favourite parts of the movie are definitely the parts where we see old clips from Hugh's boy band, as well as him performing to his adoring fans of old. And I didn't mind the music, either!As far as cheesy rom coms go, this is probably one of the better ones, even if it's not nearly at the heights of movies like The Wedding Singer.",7,0,0,13 February 2016
Blade Runner," Legendary
","Blade Runner is a classic that I was first exposed to in high school days, when I studied it in English class. Later, during university, I was again able to study it, and I even wrote about it in my honours thesis.Blade Runner presents a classic view of a very dingy, depressing future. When I think of this movie, one of the main things that comes into my head is the vision near the start of the smog- choked eternal-night cityscape with its exploding fires all over the place. Not exactly the kind of pretty future we hope for, and yet part of me wishes I could be alive to see such a future unfold. Yikes, what does that say about me? Am I perhaps an Apocalypse enthusiast? Well, maybe I am.For anyone interested in imagining a dystopian world for writing or film-making or art purposes, this movie is a great place to start.P.S. Vangelis's soundtrack to this movie is a huge part of the reason why the movie gets 10 stars. Love the soundtrack.",10,0,3,21 May 2013
Speed," Aww yeah, baby
","Speed stars two of my screen favourites, Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves, and perhaps for that reason it's a super sexy exhilarating ride. It is one of those movies I can re-watch quite frequently. I'd say I dig it out at least every 6 months or so. And I love it every time!I love Keanu's character - can we say SEXXXXY? - and Sandra's is entertaining as well. Annie really steps up to the plate when a very scary situation calls for it.This movie is action-packed, and has sad as well as exciting moments. I never cease to get really sad at one particular scene that I won't mention 'cause, you know, that'd be a spoiler. All in all, yep, this is still a favourite and never gets old!",8,0,0,21 May 2013
The Sixth Sense," Amazing, even when you re-watch
","The Sixth Sense is one of those movies that once you've seen it the first time, you're never going to be able to watch it the same way again, due to the gasp-worthy twist near the end. So, in that sense, it's sort of a one-time deal. I still remember how I actually did gasp, and feel this jolt of shock go through me, when watching it at the cinema and realising the truth of the situation. And while I can never recapture that feeling when watching this film again, I do still get a lot out of it while re-watching.I love Bruce Willis's role in this film, in that it's so unlike any of his other stuff that I've seen (i.e. not action). And although now whenever I hear Haley Joel Osment's name I think of Supernatural (heh), I still think he was incredible in this movie. He put the Harry Potter kids to shame, and it's hard to believe he could be so amazing at the age he was.Amazing film.",10,3,5,21 May 2013
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," Gosh, I really love this one
","This movie takes me back to childhood. It's so cheesy and silly, but it's also totally bodacious, dude, and though I hardly ever watch it anymore, I still smirk with delight anytime I see it in my DVD collection.I think this was a great role for Keanu Reeves, but it's been pretty sad not to see Alex Winter in more movies. I've only seen him in a couple of TV shows, for one episode at a time. I still love him in these movies, though.In closing - gotta love Miss of Arc and 'Bob' Genghis Khan. But that's just a hint of the silly awesomeness that awaits you if you sit down to watch this movie.",9,0,0,21 May 2013
The Wedding Singer," Ten out of ten
","I marvel at the fact that this movie has such a low average score! But here is a top-scoring review to throw into the mix.The Wedding Singer is a great tribute to the awkward, at-times-eye-straining 80's, complete with a brilliant soundtrack and awesome wardrobe. I love the story, and Adam Sandler's character. I also think Drew Barrymore's character Julia is just so cute.I only recently realised that 'George' is played by Patricia Arquette's sister Alexis, but I guess that's just another reason to love the character - the Arquettes are fabulous!In short, I believe this movie is made of pure genius. And not just because Billy Idol's in it. It makes me laugh, but also plucks at the heart strings just right. Finally, they do a great job of paying homage to the 80s era in all its eyewateringly bright glory.",10,1,2,21 May 2013
The Great Gatsby," I really enjoyed it
","I had heard quite a few bad opinions of The Great Gatsby, and also a lesser number of good impressions, so I wasn't sure what to expect from it. For me, Baz Luhrmann has been mildly hit and miss, though mostly when it comes to his films I find that they're hits, for me personally. I do know that I can generally expect some wackiness from him, and Gatbsy didn't surprise me in that regard. But I'm pleased to say that all in all I did enjoy this movie.I thought it was beautiful visually, and compelling in terms of storyline. I can't say that I adored the soundtrack, unlike some of other films of Luhrmann's, but I didn't hate it or think it ruined the movie either, as some other people seem to feel.I love Leo and thought he was great in his role. It was a little strange seeing Tobey Maguire trying to be a 'wizened, washed out drunk', but I still enjoy his acting and thought he was good in this. I love the world that he ventured into but found it pretty sad how things wound up - I could really feel the 'haunted' vibe that he was talking about by the end, and felt the same way myself, as if I was actually there experiencing it.All in all I think it was a great cast and well-executed. I wouldn't say it's one of my favourite movies of all time, though.",7,1,2,28 May 2013
Jurassic Park," Still holds up in 2013
","Jurassic Park is another movie I first saw in high school - my entire year went on an excursion to Underwater World and finished the day off with a trip to the cinema. We were lucky enough to get to see this brilliant movie. My friends and I sat in the very front row (which, you know, sucked, but it didn't make the movie suck) and I remember being so excited to see this groundbreaking new movie with its purported amazing special effects.Well, watching the movie today in 2013, it still looks incredibly good - better than a lot of CGI crap I've seen in recent years. And the story is still compelling and fascinating, but then I guess we have Michael Crichton to thank for that. Thanks, Michael, may you R.I.P.!As a tiny aside, back in the day I thought Ariana Richards was THE coolness. It's a pity she never did much else, or really, anything else that I know of.",10,4,5,21 May 2013
Alien: Covenant," Comedy gold?
","When my friend and I saw this movie at the cinema, we were surprised to find it was more of a comedy than an actual scary movie. I don't think they intended it to be funny, but we laughed a lot. Unfortunately, I was disappointed in the film - that will always happen for me when there are so many stupid characters who do dumb things and therefore end up dead.The whole movie plotline wouldn't have even existed if not for one very idiotic decision early on that set the spaceship on an unplanned course. 'Oh yeah, let's go check out this mysterious planet that is just PERFECT, but that we somehow never found before when we scanned everywhere for suitable planets.' The captain was warned not to divert from the planned course, but he just took it under advisement and went ahead anyway and did a dumb-arse thing.So, that set the tone for the entire movie - lots of stupid decisions, like 'Oh I'm just gonna go do a pee, I won't be long.' YEAH RIGHT. YOU WILL BE VERY LONG. YOU WON'T BE COMING BACK FROM THAT PEE.Basically I was disappointed, particularly thinking about the original movies and how epic they were. And I'm sorry, but this new 'bad-ass lady' character can't hold a candle to Ripley.",5,1,2,14 April 2020
Draft Day," Great insight into behind-the-scenes sport stuff
","An American friend of mine had recommended this to me to watch a year or so ago when I was talking to her about the Aussie Rules draft period that was going on at that time. I finally got around to doing so recently.I really enjoyed the movie, which gave insight into the huge pressure people in the sports industry can be under sometimes - especially with American sports that are incredibly wealthy, compared to our little Aussie Rules com. It also had the personal side which Costner's character was having to balance with that pressure of work.There is really some 'wizardry' that seems to go into draft and trade periods in Aussie Rules, and the same can be seen in this movie as well. It shows that people must do their due diligence in investigating potential draft prospects, and it'd be very easy to make mistakes that will turn out to be extremely costly (both on a personal level and at a team level, which can affect millions of fans).It's funny to think that something that might seem completely uninteresting to some (how players are drafted into teams) could be made into a great dramatic story, but this movie achieved that.",8,0,0,13 April 2020
