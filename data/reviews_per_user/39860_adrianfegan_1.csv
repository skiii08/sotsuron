The Expendables 2," Greatest Action Movie of All Time
","You know how in every movie (with the exception of the Avengers) there are parts you could do without?? Well not in this movie!! It starts off with an awesome action sequence that had me fearing that it would be as good as it gets, but then, each scene that follows is either just as awesome or has me ready to say 'stop the movie' because it couldn't possibly get any better......but it does!!!The entire cast has their moments of brilliance and thus each deserved their place in this epic. The cameos may make it extra special but I have to give it to Dolph Lungren (who I wouldn't have minded if they'd ad of killed off in the first one), he and his character really improved enough to make me like him again. The director deserves just as much, if not more praise for making this not only a fantastic homage to the greatest action stars and films of all time, but for also piecing together unreal action sequences and well placed humour into just the most awesome 110mins of cinema viewing I have no problem repeating again and again.In summary, if you liked the first one, you'll love this one. And if you were a fan of the classic action movies of the 80's and 90's, you're mind will be blown by how amazing this film is. This film has set an Everest of a benchmark for the next generation of action stars to follow.My only regret is that I will never see Expendables 2 for the first time ever again!",10,4,17,16 August 2012
