The Blair Witch Project," Get real, people
","Where are these people coming from? How in the world can you people say this is horror? This is a pathetic film that that makes Wolfen look good, it makes CHUD look good. Come on people, 8.2 out of 10? This film and I use that term loosely, in a word, sucks, not scary at all, you people would be scared of your shadow...boo, I bet that scared you.",1,1,2,5 August 1999
The Blair Witch Project," This movie Sucked
","This is by far the worst movie ever, and I mean ever. Who ever thought that this movie was good, scary, is a complete idiot or less and 10 years old. Not scary by a long shot, how am I suppose to be scared by a close up on a bunch of twigs?!. I was laughing at some parts, and just wanted the actors to be killed off so this movie could end. All hype, no substance, be prepared to be ripped off should you see this movie, and get a major headache.DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!",1,1,4,1 August 1999
