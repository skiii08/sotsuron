Black Swan," Simply Stunning!!!!!!
","Most notable for films such as The Wrestler, Pi and Requiem for a Dream, Director Darren Aronofsky, has delivered a powerful film that leads you down the rabbit hole of madness. This fanciful drama pushes the boundaries of normalcy, desire and the destructive pursuit of perfection; leaving you questioning your definition of insanity.Black Swan was released in 2010. It stars Oscar nominated actress Natalie Portman, Mila Kunis (That 70's Show) and Vincent Cassel (Ocean's Thirteen). The story follows a Ballerina named Nina (Portman) who has won the lead role in a performance of Swan Lake. Nina is the personification of the Swan Queen; Princess Odette but she lacks the passion and intensity of Odile, the evil sorcerers' daughter. Thomas (Cassel), the director of the performance, see's that Nina can perform both roles and pushes her to let herself go; by any means that he sees fit. He keeps his eye on another dancer in the company, Lily (Kunis). She is everything that Nina is not. She's seductive, impulsive and dangerous to Nina's ambitious yet fearfully controlled life. Consumed by the idea of perfection Nina slowly begins to unravel and descends into an abyss of insecurity and uncertainty.Aronofsky, has used his trademark directing skills to make you feel like you are apart of the film. Whether it is his use of sounds being heard but not seen on the screen or shooting scenes in fast motion, the direction was executed exquisitely. Visually breathtaking! The score was tearfully beautiful yet unnerving all at the same time. The music undeniably enhanced all the emotion and suspense created by all the talent that went into this film. Every performance in this film, in my opinion, is flawless. Every emotion that I can think of was invoked by this film. Each character was believable and intriguing. I was pleasantly surprised at Mila Kunis's performance. Only having seen her in 'That 70's Show' my expectations were not very high. She was amazing and I look forward to seeing her in future films.The only thing that I'm going to say that is negative is my own personal pet peeve. I felt that in the first half of the movie, the plot was playing out a little too slowly for my taste. With that being said, I would still give two tremendous thumbs up for this film. It's a must see and deserves any and all nominations it receives.",10,2,5,30 January 2011
Dear John," The book was better
","I have to say first off that I love everything that Nicolas Sparks has done.I loved the book but was disappointed in the movie. I can accept small changes for the sake of the big screen. But changing overall situations, relationships and outcomes made me feel like I was cheated. However, if I hadn't read the book first I would have adored it. The cast I thought was chosen very well. It was beautifully made and delivered. It still made me cry and it took a lot of energy not to sob. I would recommend watching the movie before reading the book. Especially, if you're a fan of books. If your more of a movie fan than a reader, watch and enjoy this film before you read it.",8,0,0,18 August 2010
The Village," disappointing
","**********SPOLIER INFO *************** I have too say that I was disappointed in this film. I went in anticipating a scary story about a legend. One that according to advertising and publicity would scare and inspire. It did neither for me. Don't get me wrong, I loved the concept but felt that it was poorly delivered. To me, this movie sent the message to hide from your fears, to run and to lie. The so-called victims in this movie turn out to be nothing but a group of scared individuals who run from their lives because they can't deal with society. Not a real scary twist of events. Overall, the acting was terrific, very good performances and the shooting locations were beautiful. Just not a mind blowing plot and I felt that it had sent out a poor message.",3,1,2,8 May 2007
The Number 23," Fantastic
","Brilliant! Jim Carrey's performance was memorable. The story is captivating and scary. A must see. This film makes you think. It made my head hurt. I found myself doing the math and I got goosebumps. It has the perfect mix of suspense, drama, and comedy. I have nothing bad to say about it. The creepy thing is, my favorite # has always been 23. It made me wonder if this obsession with #23 was real or fake. Thank God for the internet. This is a dark and creepy film. Do not watch it alone. If you're anything like my better half, you'll have nightmares for weeks. So, get some popcorn. Get your girl/boyfriend. Turn out all the lights and get scared together....",10,3,6,2 September 2007
