It," Holds much of the heart of the book
","Right from the start, the scene of the little one feeding the hungry one sets a great tone. I thought that one more than anything else was a huge success. What a meal he must have made...I can see an absurd positive and absurd negative trend going on in the ratings. This is not a 10 lol at least, not in relation to its source material, however, in no way does it deserve a 1 or a 2...The thing is, having suffered The Dark Tower movie, a truly atrocious experience to any fan, I felt that while 'It' similarly only shares the title and the characters names with the source material, at least, with the background of the novel, you could relate and understand the personality quirks of the characters that is lacking any real context or explanation within the movie itself. At least they tried to be themselves, to stay true to the characters.The location and actors are all amazing, and did all that could be expected of them.See, for me, the reason the movie is a success is because it managed to portray (at least to me) the bond among the children, and the human/emotional aspect that made this and other SK titles like 'The Body A.K.A Stand by Me' such a treat.The only real letdown to me is the era. Setting it so much later has an odd twist on the tone. It's hard to explain, but these are people out of time... There's no need for that, except maybe cheaper sets?...Anyways, while not the true adaptation to the novel a die hard fan might like, I think it still retains much of its flavor and appeal. Excited to watch Chapter two!",7,0,1,5 September 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," can you stomach some stale swiss cheese? push reset and give us Darth Caedus!
","I never thought I would look back on the Phantom Menace trilogy as being part of the good ol days, but after this mess, yeah. Makes me miss the clarity and coherence of that abomination...I get it, pleasing everyone is impossible. But writing a good story is not about pleasing everyone, it's about making something fun, original, with a natural rhythm, a flow inherent in it's own style and intent behind it.In my opinion, they failed hard here. This is full of plot holes, jumbled together pieces of story lines that come out of nowhere and suddenly become meaninglessI couldn't care less about any of the 'heroes', I don't relate to any of them and I am finding myself thinking about the countless needless lost lives of the bad guys. a few lost rebel lives, ok. but seemingly hundreds of thousands of these government employees... and i am supposed to mourn who?...I mean, I suddenly realized that storm trooper armor is just for show, this is why good guys never bother. Any pistol can burn right through them!I am watching the final scenes and wondering about things like 'I wonder how much these bad guys get paid? Why the hell they still fighting? What's in it for them?...'What I am saying is that my attention and care was just not there. To be honest, it was ok. A 6/10. if it was NOT star wars but a standalone movie of similar content, would be a 4, 5 tops... So yeah, the mythos alone brought this from mediocre and broken to meh I guess ok.But, I cannot state this enough, J.J. Abrahms man, you really screwed us over. The ending, the way that the Skywalker saga is concluded, is sad and insulting. I haven't been following all this time to have everything go to the worms like that. The title itself, 'Rise of Skywalker', is about as misleading as could be, and ironically points to the very insult you have inflicted upon us by forever ruining the future of this universe.I don't care that Disney paid money to be allowed to make up the story and disregard all the cool work put in by the new jedi order novels and follow-ups, this story, this movie, to me is the fake. The only right thing they could do at this point is go for another money grab and push reset on this thing and go back to the drawing board for episode VII and use the books for material...Darth Caedus is the true conclusion of the Skywalker saga and will forever remain in my heart and mind as the real third act. This money grab is an abomination, a faulty remake of an original already well told. And the 'real' Ben Solo, the hero from the New Jedi Order, would be rolling in his grave if he were real!",6,30,86,21 December 2019
