The Incredible Hulk," When Bruce Banner's angry, he turns into a giant green disappointment.
","The Incredible Hulk is a Hulk Smash of boredom. There's not many exciting moments; there is some action, but it's not very exciting. There are some exciting moments, however. Like the final battle was admittedly pretty awesome. There's not much character or emotion in the film, but seeing this movie's reputation over the years, that's kind of how it should be.Not everything about this movie was entirely mixed, some aspects were good, while some aspect were bad. It's as OK as Marvel gets, I don't really expect anyone to remember this film, but if you want to have something playing on the background when you're busy doing something else, it's probably the best way to watch this film. Watching this with your undivided attention, however, results in some pretty boring experiences. I don't have any strong opinions about this film. It's one of the most OK films I've ever seen. It's decent, but it should be awesome! How did they blow it?So, yeah. It's not a terrible film, just a film with a lot of potential that could have been really good that took the least interesting directions. When it wants to be action-packed, it can be. It's alright for movie standards, but I expect much more out of such an exciting concept that this film ended up being a disappointment. It's not as bad as the last cinematic Hulk movie, but this movie isn't really a smashing good time either.",6,0,1,24 August 2018
X2: X-Men United," Mutation isn't the key to evolution
","Despite some decent special effects and some pretty good acting, there's not much to like about this mutant muffle sequel. Now I know that people do like this film (there are even a selected few that call it the best X-Men film), but I present that argument with me saying I have my own opinions. Got it? Good. Anyways, let's continue.The reason why I don't like X2 that much is because it focuses too much on bringing us the action rather than focusing on the actual story. You see, what made the first film pretty decent is that it balanced on the action and the story. This film is a full-blown action flick that tries to look cool rather than be an actual movie. Granted, the action scenes are fun and exciting, but those are the only moments when the film tries.In conclusion, X2 is nothing but a poor man's rehash of the first film, trying too hard to get people on the edge of their seats rather than sparking any sort of interest.",4,0,1,26 August 2018
