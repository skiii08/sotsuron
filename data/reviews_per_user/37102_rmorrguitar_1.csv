Hereditary," Fantastic
","Slow burn horror with a climax that lives up to all expectations. Creates a tense atmosphere from the get go, and continues throughout the entire film. Do not see in a crowded theater, people with no patience or depth of understanding will ruin it for you.",10,24,49,14 June 2018
