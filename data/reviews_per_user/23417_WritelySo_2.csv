Howl's Moving Castle," My favourite Miyazaki!
","What an amazing achievement! This is by far the best example I have ever seen of animated characterization. The expressions and the nuances and the emotion captured in this film are truly breathtaking. I love all of Miyazaki's work, but in Howl's Moving Castle he has managed to take it to a level that to me sets the standard.It has all of the classic stunning Miyazaki panoramas, rich settings, exciting and unusual machinery, and brilliantly conceived creatures that are often humorous and fanciful. The characters are all very expertly crafted and developed, but what really enchanted me were their expressions and the subtle but powerful ways that he chose to elaborate on their connections and emotions. It is very difficult to describe, but they come to life in such a powerful way as to seem entirely real and unique.He achieves this within the medium - not by really imitating or parroting film or live action, but by artfully exploiting the medium to enhance and capture the subtle interactions that make up relationships. He shows his audience what his characters are thinking and feeling by carefully chosen gestures and facial expressions, rather than relying always on dialog, etc. I was completely swept away by this skillful use of animation - I have never anywhere else seen anything that begins to come close to it.The story is fantastic - I haven't read the novel, but it had all of the elements I have come to enjoy in Miyazaki's work - there is the humour, the lighthearted moments, the strong, insightful, loyal, and honourable characters, the lyrical drama and action sequences. The pace is perfect - it flows nicely and is always exciting, suspenseful - I got very caught up in the characters and their struggles and hopes. The themes were expertly handled with Miyazaki flair - and always richly meaningful and perceptive.I can hardly wait to see what this brilliant artist creates next!",10,143,171,23 February 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Excellent film inspired by, but not truthful to, the book.
","The Lord of the Rings is my favourite book, and I have longed for a great while to see it put into a worthy film. Despite the fact that many major changes were made to the story, this film lives up to that title in spirit.
I would have liked to have seen the hobbits singing Shire songs at the Prancing Pony, to have seen Legolas get his due credit for meeting Frodo's party after their encounter at Weathertop... and to have seen Gandalf get his due credit for transforming the river into a stampede of white horses, would have preferred it if Saruman would not have been portrayed as being in league with Sauron, when really he really wanted to try to use the ring against him, and I really would have appreciated it if Gimli and his party would not have been portrayed as being ignorant of the fact that Moria was a ruin, and I would have liked it if Frodo had - as in the book - told no one of his plans to go off alone... all of which were changed, along with a lot of the characters' motives and emotions.I would have loved to see an exact replica of the books on film, but I see how the changes help the film to be effective in new ways. While the singing at the Prancing pony emphasizes the nievete' of the Hobbits, the lack of it emphasized how intimidated they were. Arwen is to marry Aragorn... it's nice to see her character being developed on the screen. Saruman's shift to the dark side simplifies the conflicts... so that emphasis can be put on the Fellowship and the corrupting influence of the ring. The 'realization' on screen that Moria has been overtaken helps to create an overwhelming sense of despair and dread, and Frodo's exchanges with his fellows - regarding his plans to leave - really deepen the characters and shows how wise, perceptive, and bonded this Fellowship is.Middle Earth, all of its characters, locales, peoples, creatures, and cultures are right there on the screen... which alone thrilled me... but also on screen was the heaviness of the impending doom, the dark, awful reality of the ringbearer's task, the steadfastness of the simplest folk, and the love, honor, respect, strength, and wisdom of the characters involved. There is so much a purist could criticise in this film, but I prefer to praise the faithfulness of the portrayal to the spirit of the story. I gave it a 9.",9,0,0,6 January 2002
