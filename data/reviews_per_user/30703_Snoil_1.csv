Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Almost the best of the lot, but the first still reigns.
","From a production standpoint, this is a big-screen experience that can't be matched. Perhaps a tad too much computer generated imagery in that a few scenes were handled in such fashion that didn't have to be, but that's minor quibble on my part. Given that so many new characters were introduced, I didn't mind the fact that were delved into deeper. That's for the next 2 movies anyway. I did find one major annoyance in the Jar Jar Binks character. I'll ignore the assininity surrounding his appearances (which are myriad) as best I can when I see it a second time. I'm no longer the same kid who saw Star Wars when it was released, but I'm betting even kids won't warm up his ridiculous one-dimensionality. Hope he's one show character. I enjoyed the performances of the rest of the cast wholeheartedly, even the characters who weren't supposed to be likable. Also enjoyed being able to see a little more of the political background the saga is set against. Senator Palpatine was the best of the lot, and I hope we get more and more of him.All in all, worth seeing and very much so. I won't see it 6 times at the theater like I did the original Star Wars, the Jar Jar character is just way too annoying for that and has a ton of screen time, but I'll definitely go see it a second time.",7,0,0,25 May 1999
