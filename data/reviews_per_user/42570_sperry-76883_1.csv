Hereditary," Horrible awful crap!
",We laughed through some of this movie and spent the balance trying to tIe it all together. ANYONE who gives this movie any more than one star should be examined by a team of mental health professionals. I felt robbed after only paying 53 cents after a Redbox promo code. If you rent this movie after reading this review shame on you.,1,0,1,9 September 2018
