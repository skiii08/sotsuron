The Lobster," Slower & With No Emotion
","I'm sure I'm supposed to extract some deep meaning from this, but my only takeaway was the direction 'slower & with no emotion' must've been uttered every time there was a take 2 (which, judging by the final product, was not often).",1,2,6,23 October 2019
Detroit," Tense Core
","An engaging & (sadly) pertinent story with strong performances, the film's tense core is somewhat betrayed by its chaotic opening & limp finale; the choice of the filmmakers to use real victims but fictionalized cops left me hollow.",7,0,2,9 January 2019
Chinatown," An Absolute Master Class
",An absolute master class in filmmaking; Robert Evans assembled the best talent - both in front of & behind the camera - at the top of their respective games to bring Robert Towne's flawless script to life.,10,3,5,10 January 2019
Rocketman," Pure Joy
","Spellbinding spectacle is pure joy; makes great use of John/Taupin's songs and subverts the expectations of a regular biopic via many fantastical sequences, while not ignoring some of the more grounded, uglier aspects of John's life.",9,3,5,30 June 2019
A Star Is Born," An Overhyped Disappointment
","At its best & most honest whenever music is being performed, but feels artificial in almost every other way; the script is as bloated & ham-fisted as the direction and much of the acting; an overhyped disappointment.",4,1,2,16 October 2019
Wind River," Powerful Story
","Jeremy Renner gives one of his strongest performances in another very good Taylor Sheridan screenplay, who also directs; although at times a little 'dialogue-y', the powerful story & sure-handed direction make up for any shortcomings.",8,0,0,17 March 2019
Captain Marvel," Good, But Not Great
","Good, but not great, addition to the MCU canon with an 'Ant-Man'-like mix of action & comedy; Larson & Jackson bring a playful energy to their roles, and Mendelsohn was on point; era-appropriate pop songs were a little overdone.",7,1,6,13 March 2019
Aquaman," Overlong Mixed Bag
","Neither cool underwater effects nor Jason Mamoa's unbridled enthusiasm can save this flick; (at times) bad greenscreen, poorly timed/written exposition, crappy songs, pointless fight scenes, & too much plot drowns this overlong mixed bag.",5,1,3,4 January 2019
Bird Box," Deliciously Tense
",Deliciously tense thriller immediately grabs you by the throat & does not let go; sure-handed direction guides near flawless performances through a rock-solid structure; just now getting my breath back.,8,1,6,8 January 2019
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Exhilarating
","Exhilarating & fun action & effects sequences, along with some decent mystery-solving elements, make up for its occasional dalliances into plot conveniences & unfortunate off-screen plot reveals.",9,0,0,6 January 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Perfect Conclusion
","Perfect conclusion to the 22 film saga satisfyingly wraps up several characters' multi-film arcs, while opening up possibilities for several others; that said, it's not without its faults, but I still enjoyed it thoroughly.",10,2,6,3 May 2019
Toy Story 4," A Very Welcomed Addition
","What its predecessor did to wrap up the story of Andy, this does for Woody's journey, & in such a funny & adventurous way; while I would've never considered it a necessity, this movie arrived as a very welcomed addition to the family",8,1,5,2 September 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Aimless &... Dull
","Completely aimless & criminally dull, Tarantino's (lack of) story gives a huge middle finger to the film's flawless production design & standout performances from Pitt, DiCaprio, & relative newcomer Julia Butters",3,5,8,2 September 2019
The Imitation Game," Confident... Competent...
","Confident performances, competent direction, & an interesting structure help raise this above its pedestrian plotting & ever-so-gently forced dialogue; not your typical war or relationship or societal outsider movie.",8,0,0,9 February 2019
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," A Marked Improvement
","Well written & well paced, a marked improvement over its predecessor, even with some of its (forgivably) dated effects; as the characters mature, so does the filmmaking.",8,1,1,5 January 2019
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Overblown Pomp & Circumstance
",More of the same almost collapses under the weight of its overblown pomp & circumstance; don't get me wrong - it's a lot of fun - but its narrative relies a little too heavily on convenience.,6,1,1,4 January 2019
The Witch," Effectively Creepy
","Sets an effectively creepy tone with its washed-out visuals & minimalist score; the cast, costumes, & production design plunge the viewer head-first into the world of the film, but the 'conclusion' (as it was) felt a little flat.",7,2,3,17 March 2019
Joker," Disturbing Character Study
",Disturbing character study disguised as a comic book origin story holds its audience captive by grounding Joaquin Phoenix's mesmerizing performance in an authentically gritty world; could serve as a great first act in a larger narrative.,9,1,2,20 October 2019
It Chapter Two," Like A Snake Eating Its Own Tail
","A good cast coupled with several effective jump scares collapses under the weight of a bloated run time that is unfortunately necessary in order to service its numerous characters properly, much like a snake eating its own tail.",6,0,0,15 September 2019
The Deer Hunter," Epic Storytelling
","Epic storytelling takes its time but is never boring; riveting performances result in wholly fleshed-out characters who are natural & believable, yet refreshingly unpredictable; so absolutely real & emotional.",9,1,2,28 January 2019
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Wonderfully Executed
",Wonderfully executed final chapter stands as a loving tribute to those who survived & to those who perished by giving all involved both a character & story appropriate send-off.,9,0,0,7 January 2019
