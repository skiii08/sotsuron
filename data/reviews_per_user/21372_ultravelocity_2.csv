First Man," What did I just watch? Incredibly boring!
","What a disappointment. Can't remember the last time I watched such a slow, boring, bland movie. They sucked all the excitement out of the achievement. Skip this one.",4,2,5,31 March 2019
Captain America: The First Avenger," Yet another mediocre superhero movie
","I don't understand the other glowing reviews here... must be from people involved with the film. Captain America is yet another superhero movie this summer with the same old plot, same tired special effects, lame dialog, and no character development. I was very close to walking out of the movie. The action sequences were pretty boring and mainly consisted of Captain America running and jumping around. The soundtrack was extremely generic and forgettable. The villain (can't even remember the his name, or any other character besides Steve Rogers) was the same clich√© we've seen over and over again. After seeing this and Thor, I am convinced that the Avenger's movie will be a letdown. And don't even bother watching this thing in 3D.",6,18,42,23 July 2011
