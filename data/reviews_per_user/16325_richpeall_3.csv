Skyfall," Big Budget, Big Ideas, Tiny Comprehension.
","The plot is overall relatively interesting. The portrayal of 'the bad guy' was for me, a high point in the movie. While adding little to the actual story, some of the cinematography was picturesque and visually rewarding to the viewer.The movie, while overall had been mildly enjoyable sadly left me angered by constant plot holes and poor storytelling elements. In every instance of the movie being disjointed it seemed like the director or perhaps the editor was suffering from an attention deficit.There are glaring issues which can, for some, be washed over with a little ignorance, but overall the story had the apparent appearance of a young child excitedly, if rather poorly retelling it.There are too many things in this movie that leave me frustrated that I can be anything but unsatisfied with my viewing.",3,3,6,30 August 2018
Joker," A movie unafraid to approach mature concepts. Near perfection in its execution.
","Simply one of the most meaningful movies I've seen, possibly ever. I don't even mean that flippantly or with glib offhand comment.Despite the fact it is 'based upon' a comic character, the acting, the script, the direction, the lighting, the pacing, everything in this movie was, in my very humble opinion, perfect.I've seen this film twice now, and while I must admit it is a film that might push the wrong buttons for some folk, to me, this is an exact and detailed exploration of some very mature themes, while remaining true in the canon of it's 'world'.I could explain every small thing I found to be exceptional about this film, but to do so, I'd have to recite the movie from start to end. Instead, I can only recommend that you see this film.Don't expect to feel good at the end, but go and see it and then think on what you saw. It's not a nice movie, it's not a movie to enjoy, it a movie that is to be seen.",10,1,2,23 October 2019
Heat," I Just don't see why people love it.
","So, this may come as a surprise, but I've not seen this movie properly, and now that I have, I realise just why I've never watched it properly.The story takes too long and goes nowhere. The side 'interests' feel more like added filler content. The acting is okay, but not what I'd say even comes close to good, and is far behind amazing.Sure there is the one exciting scene (which anyone not having lived under a rock will know which scene I'm referring to...)But then the rest of the movie hangs around like an unwelcome smell.The actors are all up there, lots of big names, but they look dull as they swim through this glacial story.I see and hear people raving about this film, but for me this is a clear miss on potential.",6,1,2,9 November 2017
