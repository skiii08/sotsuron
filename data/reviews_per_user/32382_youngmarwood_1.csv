Walk the Line," Best film I've seen in many a year.
","I am touched. I am moved. It is all the more amazing that the two leads actually sang and played their parts without being dubbed. The chemistry between them is spot-on. I cannot fault this film.It has tragedy, it has comedy, it has love both true and false, it has fatherly reconciliation, it has success and failure. Oh, and it has Elvis.SPOILER: well, not really a spoiler because the story is known but the penultimate scene where Johnny halts a performance so he can ask June to marry him while they're singing on stage is probably the most romantic, the most warming and moving scene I've ever watched in a film.",10,0,0,23 February 2006
