Catch Me If You Can," I caught it, and it was great!
","What a great story!  Spielberg sure can pick them, and this one is a doozy. Top-rate acting, crisp direction and a nice emotional oomph makes for a good caper flick.  Hanks continues to flex his acting muscle while DiCaprio plays a part seemingly tailor-made for his talents.  Fresh, delightful and a wonderful movie for guys & dolls date night!",9,1,2,3 February 2003
Citizen Kane," Timeless in story, arguable in greatness
","I'm no student of film and certainly not a qualified critic, but I try to judge every film on its own merits.  This film is a multi-layered gem which is relevant in any time.  It deals with questions of human nature.  It makes you think.  Timelessness, to me, makes any film great.  If you can pull a film out of its temporal context, and it still tells a relevant story, then it is a great film.  Citizen Kane does just that.  Watch and enjoy a masterful piece of movie history, one that certainly does deserve mention in the company of the 'greats'.",7,0,5,21 January 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A modern film masterpiece!
","This movie was an absolute masterpiece. Middle-Earth is brought to lust, lavish life and the characters are perfect.  The film-makers obviously did extensive homework, right down to the use of the Elven language that Tolkien created as well as his maps and runes.  Visually, the movie is stunning, and in some ways recognizable- clearly, much of the art that has been created in homage to the trilogy has been used in designing the sets in the movie. The story moves along briskly and is true to the original story, though naturally there is some abridging.  The acting is first rate, the effects are phenomenal.  See this movie- then see it again!",10,0,0,27 December 2001
The Matrix Revolutions," The Greatest Story Ever Told about... Computer Viruses?
","This film, and its successor, have been ripped apart for their apparent lack of story and 'recycled' action.  Well, folks, I give you the American mindset- what have you done for me lately!This trilogy isn't nearly as bad as many make it out to be.  It is a wonderful story about two diametrically opposed computer viruses- one is Neo, the other is, of course, Agent Smith.  Neo inadvertantly created the Agent Smith virus at the end of the first movie.Revolutions pulls many of the loose ends together and paints a compelling picture of what exactly is the machine's motivation.  It also speaks to the nature of faith, belief and predetermination.  An awful lot of stuff for a science fiction movie, and not always clearly articulated, but its there none-the-less.If you think the Matrix Trilogy was confusing, check out a David Lynch film. Matrix will look like 'See Spot Run' in comparison.There is no revolutionary new effects, there isn't any additions to the Matrix way of fighting.  Neo doesn't fight all that much.  But the final assault on Zion is something to behold, and the Club Hell scene is rather juicy.  Naturally, the climactic battle between Smith and Neo is suitably over the top and viscerally powerful.Go see it and see it for what it is- a good science FICTION movie with a few, if somewhat muted, messages and plenty of food for thought.",7,0,0,13 November 2003
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Great action, quickly forgotten
","This somewhat unnecessary sequel is nevertheless enjoyable.  You can unplug from reality and ride the rollercoaster of thrills that this film provides. Then you can quickly forget it and go about your business.The story nicely explains away why everything isn't honkey-dorey after John and his mom averted Judgement Day.  I still wonder why John Connor of the future can't send a newer model to save his younger self, but... the film is popcorn for the mind and candy for the eyes.  Enjoy!",6,0,0,17 November 2003
The Fast and the Furious," Think 'Point Break' crossed with 'Gran Turismo'.
","This was an entertaining movie despite being unoriginal.  The characters are suprisingly well-developed, and the cars are pretty cool- though, being from the Detroit area, I was hoping for a bigger dose of Motor City muscle. But, it's true to its So-Cal setting and mindset.  Unfortunately the story has already been done- replace the racers with surfers, the trucks with banks, Vin Diesel with Patrick Swayze and voila, you have Point Break.  Still, it's a joyride to be sure, with awesome (albeit being obviously staged) car stunts and a 'furious' pace.  If you like fast cars and drag-racing, you'll enjoy this movie.",7,1,1,9 January 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," A worthy second chapter!
","I must begin by congratulating the cast and crew- especially Peter Jackson- on a magnificent job.  Bringing one of the most analyzed, beloved and discussed book-trilogies to cinema is a true feat.  The Two Towers continues what began as a masterpiece and pushes it to legendary status.  I firmly believe the final installment will make the series a true classic.The Two Towers begins pretty much where FotR left off.  I'll spare you the synopsis as so many have been given already.  The movie does a remarkable job in tying together the widespread events that form the second book of the Rings trilogy, and of course the director had to make several adaptations to make the journey enjoyable and sensible for the viewer.  Also, the story becomes less intimate as the characters are swept up into events larger than themselves (though, naturally, their contributions weigh heavily in the outcome).I say this because purists are howling and gnashing teeth about the numerous story changes.  Where they all 'necessary'?  Maybe not, but if you judge the movie on its own merits, it is an amazing triumph.The effects are incredible.  Gollum, the much-mentioned CGI character voiced (and motion-acted) by Andy Serkis, is the new standard for such characters. The battle for Helm's Deep is intense and epic in scope.  The Ents are enjoyable and a nice take on a Tolkien's vision.  Overall, the picture is technically superior to FotR largely because of Gollum.Pacing-wise, the movie will need a little help that hopefully will be addressed in the inevitable 'extended-cut'.  There are scenes between Aragorn and the elves which seem a little disjointed and negatively affect the flow of the story.  These scenes are a minor blemish in an awesome overall effort.See the movie, enjoy it, and make a note to never, ever tick off the Ents!",9,0,0,24 December 2002
The Matrix Reloaded," Whoa!
","Neo said it best in 'The Matrix' when he exclaimed 'whoa'... whoa times two applies to this visually incredible sequel.  While 'the question', what is the Matrix, drove the first movie, Neo's continued ascent as a super-hero in the 'Matrix Reloaded'.  His struggles to comprehend what he must do now mirrors his struggle to accept his new reality in the first installment.The movie is well-worth the price of admission.  The effects are state-of-the-art, the action is breath-taking, the cinematography exhilarating.  The story moves long in comic-book fashion (quite by design), punctuated by awe-inspiring action scenes unlike anything ever put to film. Instead of a major revelation, like learning what the Matrix is, you are treated to several smaller, but just as important, ones.The only complaint I have is that the end of Reloaded seems a bit, well, jumpy.  It's almost like they decided they had to cut some time out of the movie. Still, this is a minor complaint and doesn't detract from the viseral impact of the film.  Go see it, and expect to want to see it again.  I saw it best put that this is truely a continuation of the first film, no better, no worse, but technically superior.",8,0,0,16 May 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," A fitting end to a perfect trilogy
","The best way to sum up the impact and quality of this movie?  It was everything that the Matrix trilogy wanted to be and couldn't.  In deed, this trilogy will likely eclipse the original Star Wars films as the greatest film trilogy of all time.  It strikes me as one that will be timeless, appealing to generations of film lovers.TRotK is a masterwork in every sense, bringing the series to a triumphant, breathtaking conclusion.  It continues the pace of growing ever larger, while simultaneously becoming more intimate in terms of character growth. It is, in short, the perfect visual realization of JRR Tolkien's vision.Congratulations to the new king of moviedom, Peter Jackson, and the wonderful actors that breathed life into the biggest cinema gamble of all time.",10,0,0,19 December 2003
