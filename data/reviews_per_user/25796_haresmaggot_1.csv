National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Oh boy, what a stinker
","What is this cast doing in this film? There must be some absolutely stonking smaller budget films coming out nursed by the cast, because that's the only way I can see the great actors in this film agreeing to this piece of crap.Now, in my time, I've read quite a lot of pseudo-revisionist history. And while the first National Treasure was plausible to the fringes of freaky history, riding a Da Vinci Code wave, this stretched my ability to suspend my disbelief to breaking point. Gone are the 'you're going to do what?!' chortling surprises of the first film, which wasn't a fab film in itself. Now even a wide-eyed rube like myself sat there saying 'this is ludicrous' and I'm glad I got to see it on my cinema pass, because if I'd paid full whack I would be disappointed.I know, I know, you're asking why did you go and see it in the first place? Well I'd heard bad reviews about it and couldn't believe it would be this bad. I was wrong.",2,13,22,20 February 2008
