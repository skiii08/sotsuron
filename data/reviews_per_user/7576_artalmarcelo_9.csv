Moneyball," Safe bet where to put your eyes for 2 hours
","Old recipe never fails. Real story very well scripted with a huge star it's a good deal, especially if it's about a popular sport. I felt for moments like watching the brilliant 'Any given Sunday', cause the movie takes you deep into baseball, showing how the sport looks from the inside. It also felt like 'Jerry McGuire' from time to time. I'm not a big fan of Brad Pitt. I believe the guy is an average actor, and this is pretty much an average role he has to play as well. He doesn't have to cry, he doesn't have to express any extreme feeling. He just needs to act a little crazy and a little angry from time to time, make women take a deep breath, and that's it. Piece of cake for him. If you are a baseball fan, you are going to love this movie. If not, just like me, you are going to have a really good time watching it.",8,0,1,8 January 2012
Hugo," Hypnotic experience in a City that feels like London, but is Paris.
","Hugo is an almost flawless movie with one remarkable characteristic: is visually stunning. Colors, scenarios, visual effects, city landscapes, everything is so beautiful that the whole tale becomes hypnotic. Scorsese shows once again how versatile he can be, proving that he deserves his place in the Hall of Fame as one of the greatest directors of all time. There's only a few guys in this business who can get the best out of every genre, and he's undoubtedly one of them. Hugo is a magnificent Dickensian-style tale, surrounded by lovely characters that will captivate you from the very beginning, making you roll into a mesmerizing 2 hours ride. Why ALMOST flawless? Well, you can call me picky if you want, but if part of the attraction of this movie is that it is situated in Paris, then let be in French. The Dickensian touch is great and the accent of the characters is musical, but if you want to use those resources in the film, just adapt the story and make it in London, cause having all these amazing Parisian characters speaking UK English sounds really misleading. I mean, you let it go when it's an animated movie and the main character is a funny little rat, but when actors are real things are different. That didn't prevent me from having a blast, though, but it just didn't feel like Paris, it felt like London.",8,5,6,11 March 2012
Warrior," Who was Rocky, again?
","It turns out that I went to the movies to see MI4 (great movie, by the way), and on my way back home, I stopped by in the movies store to rent a DVD and fill my lonely night. It turns out that I rented a masterpiece. You will see a deep story that on its surface bleeds action. You will cry, laugh and shout from your seat out of spontaneous emotions. With every discussion between the characters, with every non expected punch, you will feel like you are in the movie, like you are part of the story. Believe me if I tell you I didn't want this movie to finish. Believe if I tell you that this one makes 'The Fighter' look like an average movie. Believe me that for a moment I forgot who the hell Rocky Balboa was, and all the sudden, the credits were just rolling up.",9,0,3,7 January 2012
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Long live MI franchise
","Hat off to Tom Cruise, who bought the rights to keep this franchise going on the big screen 15 years ago, and did nothing but make it better and better since then. MI 3 was already a blast to me, but it's really amazing that a franchise keeps it so fresh in the 4th installment. Seriously, how many franchises in the history of movies got to deliver so well in their 4th attempt? Well, MI 4 does. There's no easy money here. There's no use of the brand to fill the arcs and give a damn about the product. There's hard work from producers, actors, directors, scriptwriters, screen players, a whole orchestra trying their best to deliver fresh and top notch entertainment. New characters, new gadgets, subtle twists and a whole lot of unbeatable action makes MI one of the best action franchises ever in the history of movies. Ghost protocol is what every action movies fan is expecting and more. It's a long movie that seems like half an hour, it's fun, smart and highly rewarding. Tom Cruise knows what movies are about. As an Indiana Jones and Steven Spielberg's fan, I gotta say I would have loved to have a 4th chapter that was what Ghost Protocol is to the MI franchise, instead of the crap we got. It really does not get better than this. 2012 action movies have a hard benchmark to compare with. Keep it coming, Ethan Hunt.",8,3,7,7 January 2012
Drive," The art of telling a story through images.
","This is a great example of why cinema is an art, of why stories get compellingly better when they are told brilliantly in a succession of magnificent images. This is what Driver is, a string of unbelievable, unexpected and harmonic sequences, and It needs basically nothing else than that to shine. This is what movies are about: telling stories through images, and when someone does it at its best using a vast combination of resources, it's amazing how suppressed dialog can get. The saying states that one image is worth 1000 words, and Driver is a wonderful example of it. The director here doesn't play around, just like the main character. Every car sequence, every slow motion shot, every unpredicted action scene, every expression in the characters' face captured by the camera, every single part where music plays, seems to be perfectly crafted and polished. Yeah, OK, may not be an original story, and that's the only reason why this movie is not a 10. However, it's a good reminder that the key element in movies are is not to have an original story, but mostly how it is told. The art of telling stories through images clearly deserves more than the 7th place this time around.",9,2,5,2 February 2012
The Adjustment Bureau," Sometimes an idea is not enough
","Especially in Science Fiction, to have a great idea is not enough. You have to build a story around that idea, cause if you don't, then the whole picture feels like it's out of place. I think this move was originally a great idea that didn't work just because they didn't find a good story to tell around it. As a result, when I watched it I felt it was too unreal. When you are in front of a good sci-fi movie, you really don't stop to think if it could be true, but you think yourself ¨what an amazing story¨. That doesn't happen here. Here, the guys with hats, the doors, and the whole fantastic environment around a real city feels like out of place. Feels like if in Driving Miss Daisy suddenly the car flies away. Good crazy ideas with great stories: Matrix, Inception, Stranger than Fiction, Cold Souls, The 13th Floor and Dark City (among others). The Adjustment Bureau is not in that group. A good idea in a bad story.",5,1,2,13 June 2011
The Artist," When Old Fashion is also refreshing
","The Artist isn't an homage to old movies, as you may read or hear around. The Artist is considerably more than that, and it's brand new. The Artist is creativity in its maximum expression, going all the way through from screen writing, directing and acting, since the very first minute to the last. The script is really fantastic and the director's vision of how to put that script down to images is even better. In a movie where there are no dialogs, every scene is crucial, and the director seems to understand that. Emotions are so well transmitted through the screen to the audience, that it really makes us think if dialog is fundamental in movie making. Well, the answer is no, when the execution is so perfect, but this is top notch movie making and especially top notch acting, which is probably the main feature of the whole film. The actors in this movie are so expressive that they don't need to talk to make you understand. You'll understand by only watching. You will laugh and you will cry, but more than anything, you'll probably love this movie, just as much as I did.",9,3,6,20 February 2012
In Time," The right concept in the wrong hands.
","I'm still asking myself what would have been of an idea like this in the hands of Spielberg, Riddle Scott, Nolan, among others. Probably a great experience. Well, sadly, those guys had nothing to do with this movie, and instead, we received a movie with nothing but holes. All kind of holes. You shoot them, they are there. I'll mention lame dialog, terrible acting and a nonsense chain of events that ultimately makes you think you are wasting your time watching it. It's really a wasted opportunity, cause such a rich idea could have had one visionary guy behind, like one of the above mentioned (and those are only few examples, but there are MANY), who would have made sure to tell a story that makes sense and take the most of an original initiative. I've said this many times already: ONE IDEA IS NEVER ENOUGH. Good ideas have to be surrounded by substantial execution: a good script, good acting, good photography, etc Here the concept is brilliant, genius, but the execution is poor.",5,0,2,2 February 2012
50_50," There's a lot of room for comedy when chances of survival are so high.
","50/50 is a fresh and original take on a very delicate subject such as cancer is, especially when it happens to a 27 years old young man. Unlike most of the other movies that have treated a similar story, 50/50 narration focuses only in the humorous aspect of it and avoids the tragic component. There are a few, subtle and very short dramatic moments in the movie, which are completely necessary to deliver a solid and realistic story, but this is a plain comedy 90% of the time, and when it's not, it really doesn't need to go for the low punch to succeed. 50/50 succeeds on involving every character around the patient and elaborating the story-telling through their relationship. In the end, this is a movie about friendship, love and family ties, and even when there's really nothing technically extraordinary about it, the result is very refreshing and entertaining. There are also some very funny gags, one of them a little dark, that made me laugh out loud. I enjoyed this movie a lot.",8,0,0,20 February 2012
