United 93," a must see for history buffs
","I saw the made for TV movie ( Filght 93) on A & E, which concentrated on the passengers' personalities, and while it was very good, and respectful of the people involved, I found United 93 to be extremely good at showing what went on that morning. The fact that a large number of the individuals actually portrayed themselves added to the veracity of the movie. While we will never know for certain what the conversations were, nor what the reactions of the people on the plane were, I thought the portrayals were reasonable and realistic. It is easy to 'Monday morning quarterback' the reactions of the flight controllers, the FAA and the military, but the truth is, no one saw anything like this coming. See the movie, and think about what you would have done, and I believe you will agree with me: they were real life heroes.I highly recommend this move, since we can not forget what happened that day.",9,0,2,21 May 2006
