Your Name.," This film is simply a masterpiece in storytelling that has everything you want in a romance.
","Your Name is a Japanese animated film written and directed by Makoto Shinkai, based off his own novel of the same name. I was reluctant to watch this movie at first because besides the works of Studio Ghibli, I am not the biggest fan of anime. However, Your Name was making waves around the internet, with people considering it the best anime movie of all time. I am someone who is naturally gravitated towards hype, and with expectations leveled, and my mind opened, and I went ahead and saw the film. And boy, when the credits rolled, I was stunned, mesmerized and enchanted with just how beautiful this movie was in every way. My relationship with anime does not extend beyond Ghibli films, first few seasons of PokÃ©mon and JRPG cutscenes, the reason being I always feel Japanese animation lacks gravitas and instead replaces it with heavy- handed over-the-top storytelling and voice acting. I was glad to see Your Name not succumbing to any of those tropes, in fact, Your Name being an animated film, was able to make laugh, cry, feel anxious and fulfilled all within 90 minutes, something most live-action movies with real actors cannot even dream of trying. Mitsuha and Taki, our two leads are very charming and funny. The main hook is you hardly see them as themselves, instead they are mostly in each other's bodies. Because of this, we see their characters develop as they literally walk in each other's shoes.The first act to my surprise was candidly funny. I found myself laughing out loud at the fish out of water and situational jokes. There is a running gag where every time Taki would wake up in Mitsuha's body, he would feel her boobs to make sure he is not in his own body, this is when Mitsuha's little sister would burst in the room and see her 'sister' touching herself. Comedy like this is perfect, because it is within character, situational and not forced.I am going to avoid all spoilers for the second act onwards because I went in the movie knowing very little, and I wish for anyone watching this film to do the same.I will say there is an obstacle in the third act that is suspenseful and tension-filled but not in a Hitchcockian way. Instead, you just want to see the characters succeed and achieve the impossible so much, that when an obstacle stands between them, you cannot help but to be on the edge of your seat. I was rooting for them because I was emotionally invested in Taki and Mitsuha as human beings, and I care about them, and genuinely want a happy ending for them.Having some time to think about the movie after seeing it not too long ago, I felt Your Name connected with me on in intimate level few films have done before. Ever since I was young I was a romanticist, always believing the meeting with the love of my life is bound by some sort of fate and destiny since the beginning of time, and I simply have not found her. The movie explores this subject, what if you are tied to a person by a string? You two through thick and thin, chaos and peace, no matter the time difference, spatial difference, are destined to meet? A story of this kind would have touched my heart regardless of the quality of the actual film, but thankfully, besides having an excellently written script, the movie's supplemental elements like animation and music do not lag behind.The hand-drawn animation in this movie is probably the best I have ever seen. Every frame was perfectly crafted and colors are rich and vibrant. I especially appreciated the little details like water droplets on a spider web during the raining scene and of course, the deliciously animated food throughout. The movie was truly like a painting coming to life and rivals with even some of Ghibli's best. Another thing I need to mention is the music, composed by Japanese rock band, Radwimps. It was simply fantastic, amazing, incredible, heart- warming, heart-wrenching and every adjective that is associated with the word 'nostalgic.' Funny how a piece of music you have only heard for the first time recently can give you the feeling of nostalgia, but that is the power of this film's soundtrack. My favorite piece is Date that plays during Taki's date with his co-worker. The track accompanying the sunset imagery and Tokyo cafÃ© evokes a poignant, bittersweet sentiment within me, and I absolutely loved it. It makes me think back of times in my life where I was in a similar situation as Taki, and the feelings I had then, the moment, the sunset, the yearning of days gone by.Your Name is a brilliant, heart-felt animated film about two different people's absolute desire to meet one another despite being separated by space and time. Taki and Mitsuha's conviction that leads them to the end of this emotional journey should be viewed by everyone, no matter if they like anime or not. This film is simply a masterpiece in storytelling that has everything you want in a romance. Go see this movie, you will not be disappointed.",9,3,5,4 July 2017
It," Imagine a very good episode of Goosebumps, throw in good child acting, Conjuring-styled suspense, buckets of blood and a focused unrelenting villain
","It is directed by Andy Muschietti and it is a remake of the 1990 three- hour miniseries which in turn was based on Stephen King's own 1986 horror novel. So what is 'It?' As a kid browsing through video rental stores in 90's, I have always noticed the peculiar VHS cover with a white face painted, sinister looking clown on it with the title 'It' in bold red colors. The miniseries was hailed by classmates at school to be the scariest movie of all-time and I always wondered why; the back of the VHS seemed to show the scariest thing about the film is just a killer clown. Is it because I am fortunately enough to not have a phobia of clowns that is why it had no effect on me? Then I thought about why Stephen King chose to name the book 'It' and not 'Clown' if it is indeed just a story about a killer clown. This 20-something year old question of mine was finally answered when I saw this 2017 iteration at the cinema on opening day. It is whatever you do not want it to be. It manifests itself as the thing you fear most. In short, it is an entity that can transform and show itself as your worst nightmare. Now that my curiosity is finally answered, is the movie any good? Well, bloody yes.It as a film in general succeeds on all facets. It was creepy, scary, funny, heartfelt and emotional. Imagine a very good episode of Goosebumps, throw in good child acting, Conjuring-styled suspense, buckets of blood and a focused unrelenting villain – the results of this beautiful concoction would be It. It could have easily been a mess of a movie, been accused of copying latest horror trends of James Wan or Eli Roth, but Andy Muschietti was able to hone everything down neatly into a spectacular package. Right from the get-go, we were able to see how beautiful the cinematography is; the basement, things lurking in the shadows, rainfalls, glowing eyes, etc. Visually, this is a gorgeously shot movie. The buildups of scares are very reminiscent of modern ghost films, but that is a good thing because they are done right with good payoffs, usually a nightmare-inducing image that sent chills down the audience's spines. I am not the kind of snotty movie goer who despises jump scares because I feel they are cheap and unearned, no I actually believe they are a vital ingredient in a horror movie and without them, even the sharpest film tends to dull out. Jump scares need to be well-timed and be used to unleash the tension at the climax of a scary scene, and It understand this very well.On one hand we have a hardcore horror film that mixes the best of both worlds of scares and violence, and on the other we have a retro old- school, band of misfits, kids adventure. This film proves you can have terrifying scares and at the same time not sacrifice well-developed characters. These protagonists are not cannon fodders who merely exist in the script to bite the dust, instead they are well fleshed-out human beings with their own problems and motivations. Bill loses his brother Georgie early on and is eager and impatient to find out what happened to him. Ben is the overweight perpetual new kid in school who is smart but has trouble making friends so he stays in the library. Beverly suffers from sexual abuse from her father at home. Individually each child actor brings it in this adaptation, they were all likable and funny, but together the Losers form a chemistry so good you would feel distraught if anything were to happen to even one of them.Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise gives one of the best villain performances I have ever seen. I would put this Pennywise up there with recent cinematic antagonists such as Hans Landa, Calvin Candie and Heath Ledger's Joker. Skarsgard's body movements, facial twitches and speech patterns were all unsettlingly creepy but at the same time still magnetic to watch. To expand upon my initial question on what is exactly is It: Pennywise the Dancing Clown is just one of the many of forms It the entity takes in the novel, but Tim Curry's performance in the miniseries popularized this particular form, so to most people It is synonymous with Pennywise, thus it makes sense for this remake to keep him as the main face.Perhaps the one thing that really made It so amazing to me is despite the villain is relentless and the protagonists are just kids, seemingly insurmountable for the Losers to defeat him, Pennywise has a clear weakness and without spoiling anything, he could be defeated. It is so refreshing to watch a horror movie of this kind where the supernatural villain is not a ghost or a demon that cannot be hurt and always wins in the end, but is someone who could lose if the protagonists work together and outsmart him in a meaningful way. This gives hope and creates a sense of earnestness and sincerity to the picture, where the underdogs can eventually overcome the adversary if they do not give up.Overall It is probably my favorite recent horror movie, and as a film on a technical perspective, it is probably the best ever. The scares worked, it looked great, and the characters and acting was amazing especially by Bill Skarsgard. I love the whole authentic 80's feel, it added a lot to the whole thing. I do not know what more I can ask for in a film in general, because It is easily one of 2017's best.",9,7,17,10 September 2017
Detroit," Enthralling, powerful, and at times hard to watch
","Detroit is a historical drama thriller directed by Kathryn Bigelow, based on true events during the Detroit riots of 1967. Knowing next to nothing about the infamous Algiers Motel incident, I was still excited to see it based solely on how intense and gripping the trailer was. It would be a very interesting movie even if the story was completely fictitious, but knowing everything actually occurred in one form or another really added an extra ounce of gravity to the experience. In fact, the script was pieced together using real-life testimonies and court records, and Bigelow even invited living people from the incident as consultants on set during filming to ensure accuracy. End result is a movie that is not only entertaining, but also relevant and keeps you cognizant of issues in the real world.What I really like about Detroit is how it goes about its business in a very a matter of fact manner. Even though there are a lot of racist white characters in the movie, it certainly does not present the black individuals as completely innocent, which is heartening as reality is not always black or white, but instead shades of gray. The meat of the story is a hostage situation at the aforementioned motel, where three demonic white cops terrorize a group of people, trying to force a confession out of them for a crime they did not commit. The performances are all stellar, especially Will Poulter as the head of the racist cops and John Boyega as the security guard who witnesses the entire event. The acting in the film really helped ground the story in reality, making scenes of sudden violence all the more shocking.The film does drag a little bit outside of the motel confrontation. It could have removed the historically contextual, but cinematically irrelevant back stories of the characters and just drop us right in the middle of the main conflict at Algiers. I feel it would have made the movie tighter and less bogged down if it sans the onus of attempting to cover the entire riot. Regardless, Detroit is an enthralling, powerful, and at times hard to watch drama thriller that really stays with you after viewing. Even without knowledge of history, it is still a very enjoyable film in its own right that deserves your time at least once.",8,1,8,18 August 2017
The Hateful Eight," Trust, fear, distrust, paranoia all play out in bloody perfect fashion
","There are no filmmakers quite like Quentin Tarantino. His ultra-stylized dialogues and savvy characters combined with usually (seemingly) simple stories has been a staple of his since Reservoir Dogs. Lots of directors are cookie cutters of each other, all expendables and mix and matches, but when Tarantino dies, I guarantee there will never be another Tarantino to take his place. The Hateful Eight, appropriately named, is the eighth movie of his controversial but stellar career, and another masterpiece following personal favorites such as Inglourious Basterds, Pulp Fiction and Django Unchained. Like the latter, this movie is a western set circa the Civil War, but unlike the Django, it is a considerably 'smaller' movie. Gone are the grandiose landscapes and epic locations of the former and arrived is a mostly one-set film that is performed more like a stage play. However if this is indeed a theatrical play I am not sure if I would like to sit in the front row in fear of the gallons of spraying blood that will undoubtedly ensue.The Hateful Eight takes place on a snowy mountain in Wyoming, a few years post-Civil War, where sentiments from the majority towards African Americans are still full of suspicion, meanness and hate. Samuel L. Jackson plays Major Marquis Warren, a bounty hunter, in need of shelter from the incoming blizzard. He meets John Ruth, a fellow hunter, en route on a stagecoach to the nearby town with his prisoner, Daisy Domergue, where she will be hanged for her crimes. The three characters soon have to be holed up in a haberdashery where they meet five other strangers: Chris Mannix the local sheriff, Bob the person temporarily in charge, Oswaldo Mobray the town's hangman, Joe Gage a cowboy, and Bruce Dern as retired General Sanford Smithers; and one, some, or if not all of them are not what they say they are.The apparent obstacle of the film centers on Ruth's distrust of the six other men with his prized bounty prisoner, whom he believes they might be after. This creates a sense of tension and paranoia in the movie, a whodunit, and a 'who can you trust?' Being dealt with the dilemma of having to take a side of one of these despicable characters is both difficult and uncomfortable, since as an audience member that is what we are conditioned to do with mediums of fiction – take the side and the perspective of the protagonist. With a more traditional movie, the protagonist will be easily identified, however with The Hateful Eight, it lives up to its namesake as it presents you with characters that are shady and two-faced, so much so even by the time the credits roll, you are still left with uncertainty on who exactly to believe in.With our modern sensibilities, even the most 'likeable' – and I use the word very loosely, character is hard to like since every one of them are either women-beating and/or racist epithet-saying jerks. With every white character using the N-word freely against the lone African American, Major Warren, we cannot help but to stand by his side, if just only for those moments. Race relation is one of the central themes of the film, which I do not doubt the always progressive-minded Tarantino deliberately left in contemporary messages. One of the lines spoken by Warren in regards to black and white relations will surely ring true with the mass and will keep you thinking well after the movie.The film in whole is a mystery suspense film disguised as a western. Trust, fear, distrust, paranoia all play out in bloody perfect fashion in mostly one setting, not unlike a stage play. Its often eccentric and exaggerated performances mirror Broadway to great effect. The haberdashery, the location where the majority of the film takes place is just a medium-sized one room structure that houses eight strangers. This allows the story to play out more personal and close, and at times gives a sense of inevitable doom. Imagine locking two roosters in a small cage, something is ought to happen, and will probably not be pretty.Tarantino is no stranger to violence, but a lot of other films are also violent, so what separates those film's violence and Tarantino violence? The answer is simple: the suspension prior to the brutality; Tarantino is absolutely masterful doing it. If you are familiar with his movies you know the setup of two or a few characters sitting around a table, ostensibly talking about mundane things that generally do not push the plot forward, but instead acts as a conduit to envelop the characters' true intentions. The performances from each one of the actors are great and the dialogues are razor sharp to keep you engaged, sometimes laughing, oftentimes holding your breath. Tarantino does a wonderful job in allowing the audience to know that things are not what it seem, he will let you in a little, but not too much. He keeps his secret to himself until he wants to let you know, but for now, just enjoy the ticking time bomb from underneath the table. In a Quentin Tarantino film, it is not a matter of if the bomb will blow, but when. The result is the use of violence that is not cheap shock, but earned reward.If you liked Tarantino's other films, then this movie is a denser more personal version than all of his past works. If you do not like them, or feel offended by them, then this probably will not change your mind. At close to three hours, the pace is effortless, as lines between the characters will lock the audience in better than any gargantuan action scene from a summer blockbuster this year. Like Tarantino's other masquerading western, this is a violent film that will surely leave you in awe.",10,3,27,22 December 2015
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Fun, earnest and dramatic, Homecoming stands on its own two feet in a genre full of end of the world climaxes and world-building expositions
","Spider-Man: Homecoming is the fifth live-action Spider-Man movie and the first iteration to take place in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, making it the sixteenth film of that mega franchise. On par with popular opinions, I did not like the two Amazing films that much. I do not hate them like many others do, but I felt gone was the heart that existed in the Raimi films. To say this movie came back with just a faint pulse, is an understatement; Spider-Man: Homecoming wears its freaking heart on its sleeves! Back in 2014, Sony and Disney struck a deal to essentially share the character and allow the Web Slinger to be back in Marvel's hands where he belongs. As evidenced prior by Tom Holland's small but fantastic role in Captain America: Civil War, it was a good move. But witnessing Homecoming's excellence reaffirms it is probably the best decision the two companies ever made.I love this movie, it was simply marvelous. The film was funny, heartfelt, emotional and a visual delight. It discards the cynicism and 'grit' found in the Marc Webb's series, and instead makes Peter Parker, a pure, innocent kid who just wants prove his worth and do the right thing. No more moody, Twilight Peter snooping around saying mean things or being angsty, instead we have a protagonist here that is likable and relatable in a genuine way. It also helps that the high school setting was well utilized with a vibe that is completely different from the previous series, as it takes a more realistic, but cheerful approach to its tone and atmosphere. I really appreciated the diversity amongst the cast, it was beautiful to see representation candidly showcase on screen.Tom Holland was excellent as Peter Parker and Spider-Man, he was funny and witty, but not sarcastic or harsh. Multiple times in the film, Peter is presented a choice to either be a regular kid, stay with his friends and perhaps get the girl or fulfill his duty as a hero and pursue the crime. You can just how torn Holland is with this choice each time through his face. A lesser actor would not have been able to portray this internal conflict this exceedingly well. Michal Keaton as the Vulture was great; he is probably my favorite MCU movie villain thus far, because I bought into his motivation on why he does what he does. I also appreciated they gave him a personal connection to the hero to further the emotional impact. Marisa Tomei as Aunt May was very lovely and my eyes were glued whenever she was on screen as her motherly charm and beauty enchanted me to no ends. God she is beautiful. All the kids here actually behave like real kids and they are all hilarious, especially Peter's best friend Ned, played by Jacob Batalon. He was so natural in his performance, watching the two's relationship unfolded almost made me feel like I am part of the group as well.Most people go see a Spider-Man film for its action, and rightfully so, Spider-Man 2 has some of the best action sequences in film history to date. Homecoming is pretty exciting and great to look at, and because I did care for Peter and his friends and wanted them to be okay, the action scenes were suspenseful. However comparing it the previous movies, it definitely lags behind just a little bit. It still is visually stunning, but we just did not get a Doc Ock level of excellence here. We do get a great climatic battle on top of an aircraft that ends on an emotional note. I really appreciate this movie taking a smaller approach and not have the climax be a beam-in-the-sky, end of the world scenario like most other superhero movies nowadays. Because it just gets played out, we know the world is not going to end, so unless it really is the last film of a franchise, why keep doing it? It is nice to see the filmmaker's objective here is to display the emotions of the characters and not just trying to one-up the explosions from last big blockbuster.Homecoming is probably the heartiest MCU film to date. I am big fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I have seen all sixteen films multiple times. There is one common problem amongst each movie and that is the disservice of dramatic scenes by injecting humor into them at the wrong moments; my emotionally connection with the film is greatly weakened because of this. I think the only movie that successfully avoided this tonal problem in my opinion was Ant-Man and the first Iron Man. You can now add Spider-Man: Homecoming to that list because this movie juggles the balance between humor and drama perfectly. Using the natural charm of the cast, the jokes land on target at the correct moments when they are supposed to, and because of good character development, the dramatic scenes also flourishes in genuine fashion since they are not diffused by humor.Overall Spider-Man: Homecoming is now my second favorite movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and probably my third favorite Spider-Man movie behind the second and first one. I am glad to see it correct many of the tonal problems I had with previous movies like Doctor Strange and Amazing Spider-Man 2. Fun, earnest and dramatic, Homecoming stands on its own two feet in a genre full of end of the world climaxes and world-building expositions. No matter what happens in this universe moving forward, it will always be smaller movies like this and Ant-Man that will have the biggest impact on me because they understand it is not about the punch, but the emotion behind the punch that matters.",9,47,87,9 July 2017
Dunkirk," Technical excellence, but uninteresting and monotonous
","Dunkirk is a historical war action drama, written and directed by Christopher Nolan. I have always been a big Nolan fan so naturally I was hyped for this movie. Nolan has knack of taking a genre he has never done before and somehow make it appealing to the masses and intelligent at the same time. A superhero trilogy? Check. A dream heist film? Check. A space travel sci-fi? Check. Admittedly, I am not a big fan of the war genre, but I was still very curious to see how Nolan would tackle it.The film is unquestionably extremely well-made, and I could see why people would love it and claim it as one of the best movies of the year, but to me it was just far too dull. While the interweaving of three perspectives is interesting, I did not feel any tension during the lackluster action scenes because I did not care about any of the characters since their development was non-existent. A lot of the times, unless it was Cillian Murphy or Tom Hardy, I could not even tell which character was who, complicating things to an already unexciting movie. Hans Zimmer's soundtrack was also a miss, which is shocking because I loved all his previous Nolan efforts. Also for a war movie, it really could have benefited from an R-rating, as the bloodless PG-13 makes things even duller than it already is.There are a few things I really liked though, namely the sound design when the spitfire jets were descending down the beach, wailing terrifyingly like monstrous banshees. The acting was also mostly well performed throughout by everybody especially Mark Rylance as a civilian going into Dunkirk to save the men. The film's technical excellence cannot be denied, but with uninteresting action and monotonous characters, Dunkirk was just a disappointment. You can say I do not understand the film, but I believe I understood it just fine; I was just not as enthralled as should be to Nolan standards.",5,8,12,18 August 2017
Get Out," Get Out is not simply an enjoyable film, but also works very well as a social commentary about race relations
","Get Out is a satirical horror film written and directed by actor- comedian Jordan Peele. Having never watched his sketch comedy series, Key & Peele or any of his film roles, this was my first experience with any content of his. Consider me a fan – I was very impressed by his keen eye for both comedy and horror, which is traditionally very difficult to juggle, since tonally the genres are so different. But Peele knew exactly what it wanted to do with the film and went and did it. At first glance the movie might seem bigoted and heavy-handed to some, but when you actually watch it, that is not really the case at all. It is not a Scary Movie-like parody, which was my biggest initial concern, instead it plays it straight for the entirety, dramatic when it needs to be, and scary when the moment comes. The funny bits comes naturally mostly from situations and personalities of characters, and never once did it cross the line where I could not take it seriously. It is this earnestness and balance that really stood out to me.The movie is about a photographer, Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) going on weekend trip to meet his white girlfriend, Rose's (Allison Williams) family for the first time, the only problem is they do not know he is black. Most of us have probably faced a similar circumstance where we have to meet our boyfriend or girlfriend's parents, and especially if he or she is of a different race, ethnicity or nationality, an extra layer of awkwardness is going to be there. The movie relates this awkward scenario brilliantly to the audience. When Chris arrives at the parents' house, he meets the father, Dean Armitage (Bradley Whitford), mother, Missy Armitage (Catherine Keener) and brother, Jeremy (Caleb Landry Jones). At first everything seemed fine, but then Chris begins to realize a few things are not quite right. From their overly nice demeanor to him to the fact that the family's black servants act very strange and creepy, Chris just wants to survive the weekend and go home.On a surface level the film passes as a good mystery, horror thriller, but that is not all it is. If you want to watch this as just a scary movie, you will enjoy it, there are some jump scares, but just like the situation that Chris was in, things are more than meets the eye. Jordan Peele made the movie first and foremost to be a commentary of social issues and privileges. The entire Armitage family seems really nice to Chris outwardly but reading between the lines, you can sense the insensitivity and hostility when they ask him things like 'what's his sport?' or telling he has good 'genetic makeup.' To those whom are aware of things like this in real life, it will either cause you to groan or smile, maybe even a little bit of both.The acting here is really good all around. Kaluuya as the main lead is calm, collected and likable, but to me the couple of standouts amongst the cast are Caleb Landry Jones as the girlfriend's brother, and Lil Rel Howery as Chris' friend, Rod. Jones really only has one scene, but he absolutely stole it in my opinion. He was intimidating and strangely charming as the brother who is trying to know more about his sister's new boyfriend. Howery as the TSA friend who is taking care of Chris' dog back home was utterly hilarious in every scene he is in. He kind of reminds me Anthony Anderson when he was still appearing in every other movie.As mentioned, the movie has a few jump scares, but nothing too major. The horror mostly stems from the atmosphere and the uncertainty of Chris' situation. There were a couple shots here that sent chills down my spine. My favorite one being the dinner scene where Mrs. Armitage goes back to the kitchen to get the dessert, only to have the door swing open to reveal the maid already standing there holding the carrot cake staring disturbingly into the camera. The black servants who act and speak very white not only create discomfort and dissonance with Chris, but with the audience as well.A sign of a good movie is when it takes its time to properly set things up early and then having it pay off at the end. This movie does a masterful job at that. Every detail introduced to the audience is not wasted. Chris is a photographer, how does that matter? Photographs and photography is a reoccurring motif and plays a major role in the plot. Mr. Armitage is a neurosurgeon and Mrs. Armitage is a psychologist for a reason. The cop at beginning, Rose backs up her boyfriend and Jeremy's desire to have an MMA match with Chris? Not going to spoil anything, but all these things pay dividends at the end, and if you pay attention, it makes the movie even more well-rounded and enjoyable.Get Out is not simply an enjoyable film, but also works very well as a social commentary about race relations and real life innate fears of meeting one's significant other's parents. The whole movie just gels really well from beginning to end, and there is really not much fault to be had. If I have to nitpick about something though, it is the movie could have been more gory and violent towards the end. After witnessing Chris' journey, it would have definitely been earned and justified to display maximum carnage on screen. But that is neither here nor there, because this is still a great entry in the horror genre with or without the gore. I would say you should definitely get out and watch this movie.",8,10,18,19 June 2017
Mother!," A very good scary movie if you want to view it as just that
","Mother! is a psychological horror film written and directed by Darren Aronofsky. The movie is about a married couple living in a secluded country home being visited by strangers with the husband welcoming them in with open arms, much to the chagrins of his wife. The film has similarities with another movie of Aronofsky's, Black Swan, in that both are told through psychologically worn out female protagonists' eyes, forcing the audience to walk in her shoes and question their own sanity as the madness unfolds. Mother! has been extremely divisive since its release due to its controversial allegory and graphic content. To be honest, the popular interpretation of the metaphor did not even cross my mind once when I was watching, instead I took the movie for face value and it still had me enthralled, uneased and disturbed throughout. I believe if you go in to the movie having read about the supposed metaphor, it would greatly bias your opinion and affect your viewing experience, for that reason, I am going to review Mother! as a pure horror film to 1) avoid spoilers and 2) be objective.Mother! is very gorgeous-looking and wonderfully-acted. The film might be slow to some, but it is never boring as the situation is always building towards something keeping you captivated. It is a very strange and surreal film told through Jennifer Lawrence's eyes. We do not know much about her except she is married to Javier Bardem's older character, but as the film establishes early on, Lawrence is possibly the sanest thing in the film. The camera literally follows her everywhere in the house, which we never get to leave, creating a sense of dread and claustrophobia. The first half of the film has mostly psychological horror, with Lawrence having to deal with unruly guests with unpredictable behaviors and her slowly deranged husband. I was intrigued at frame one and found myself gripping on my seat whenever Lawrence is in confrontation with anybody, even if it is somebody that logically should pose no real danger, but the film causes you great doubt regardless. The second half contains most of the controversial visceral horror, and detailing anything therein would constitute as a spoiler so I am just going to say: viewers discretion is advised. It gets really insane and crazy to a point where you will just be dying to know how it ends.Technically the film is excellent. The cinematography brings the creepy house to life and the sound design is harrowing. The film captures the fear of being alone in your own house but not knowing if you are truly alone very well. Jennifer Lawrence gives the best performance I have ever seen of her yet; she touched the notes of vulnerability and weakness, loving, reluctance and then finally anger and contempt. Since she gets close to 100 percent screen time, any sort of hiccups or off- night would have put the film in jeopardy, but she brought it every second. Javier Bardem as the husband was wonderful as always, performing like the world-class actor he is.There are some negative though, namely some pacing issues, particularly it being a little too long and dragging towards the middle, repeating certain situations over and over again. I just want to wrap my arm around the director's shoulders and tell him, 'I get it buddy, the guests are rude, and she's vexed, now can we just move on?' The whole thing should have been shaven down to a leaner 90 minutes, which would have been sufficient to tell this story. Also a lot of weird things happen unexplained and never expound upon. I guess this feeds into the film's interpretational and allegorical approach, but also kind of lazy as it theoretically gives Darren Aronofsky the right to just throw in any bizarre content in the cauldron he can conjure and not have to worry about explaining it.Mother! is a very good scary movie if you want to view it as just that. When you start to unravel the film and break it down, that is when objectivity usually gets thrown out the window in favor of own personal beliefs. Even if the metaphors are what Aronofsky intended, within the film itself it was never stated as canon, so everything is still just an interpretation and what is most important is what you choose to see the movie as. As a superficial psychological horror flick, it worked because it was scary, disturbing and jaw-dropping like a genre film should be.",7,1,6,17 September 2017
