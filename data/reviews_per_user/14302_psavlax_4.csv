The Avengers," Action, action, action
","I always like comic based movies and this one did not disappoint. Much action, which is why I watch these movies. There were plenty of Hollywood retard thinking (which I wont mention so not to ruin the people that are not bother by it). Many funny moments and again lots of action. I would of also like if there had been full movies or some more back story on some of the characters but overall the movie was fun to watch. Great use of computer graphics and great sound track. In addition, the plot was not rich (which I think is acceptable in action movies).Definitely a great movie for anyone that like action flicks.",9,30,57,6 July 2012
Avatar," Great visuals very little plot
","This movie is as closed as eye porn as it can be. There is no plot. OK I'll summarize the plot. Corporations are BAD, natives GOOD, and good wins over evil. Visuals are fantastic I just wished there was a plot and less ramming up people's behind the unrealistic message that corporations are evil. TH\he movie is long WAY too long. Specially for a movie with no plot what so ever. The movie could of been 80 minutes and still be stretching the patience of most people. After 45 minutes I had enough of the CG eye candy and wanted the movie to end. This is a good movie to own to have it show your great home theater system but to never watch all the way as it is way too boring.",5,0,2,6 July 2012
Toy Story 3," Fun to watch
","This movie was fun to watch and it has something for everyone. Some of the the jokes are more mature but nothing offensive (in my opinion) it has kiddie jokes (that adults wont find funny at all) and everything in between. Action, adventure, a message, it is a well rounded family movie. Recommend anyone to go see, own, show at parties, etc.. As far as the length it was definitely long enough without been cut too short or been stretched. Good angles on the camera work. I do not see any reason to have this movie on 3D (then again so far I been less than impressed with 3D). I seen this in blu-ray and it is a great movie to own on blu-ray as the colors and resolution show well in HD. Sound track and sound in general was good.",8,0,1,6 July 2012
Donnie Darko," This movie suck at a new level
","This was such a waste of time, money, air. I hated the movie from the beginning, then again I do not do drugs so maybe you needed to be wasted to 'appreciate' this garbage. Went to see it with an ex-friend (yeah I don't talk to her anymore) because she taught it was a great movie. She is a coke head but normally a nice gal with alright taste but this was the turning point as I wish I could undo the time wasted watching this confusing and totally incoherent movie. I would recommend to avoid touching a DVD box with this movie. I will like to see who like this movie and get the list of the movies they liked to AVOID them as this is the worst movie I ever watched.",1,3,9,6 July 2012
