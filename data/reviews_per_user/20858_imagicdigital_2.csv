Sucker Punch," Blew me away
","Sucker Punch is a knockout. A visual masterpiece with enough story and acting to make it feel substantial. If you combine Heavy Metal, Suspiria, Tron, Kill Bill, Big Trouble in Little China, along with the visual flair of 300, you end up here. To call this film psychedelic is to make the understatement of the year. Zack Snyder definitely continues to improve as a filmmaker (even if Dawn of the Dead is just about perfect). The characterization were engaging and I enjoyed the multi-layered reality, especially the transition to the higher-level fantasies. Gets a 10 from me, and I hope this trend toward intellectually stimulating special effects extravaganzas continues. I didn't realize I'd enjoy the fantasy imagery as much as I did. Oh, and the soundtrack is just perfect. Perfect.",10,15,30,1 July 2011
X-Men: The Last Stand," Excellent night at the movies for fans of explosive action
","I'm not going to review X3, there are plenty of other reviews out there. X3 was a very satisfying action flick that made for a great Friday night at the movies, and I will certainly be renting it on DVD to watch again on my home theater.The audience obviously loved it, the theater was packed and responded to the movie from beginning to end. Usually I'm annoyed by 'loud' audiences, but in this movies case I didn't mind, because X3 is all about being a fun movie. Fans who gave X3 one star reviews, warning others not to go see it... that's kind of like dissing Aliens because you're a fan on Alien. Ten stars from me, there are only a couple of action movies per year that are of this caliber.",10,16,29,27 May 2006
