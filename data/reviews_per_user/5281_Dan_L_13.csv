The Avengers," Terribly Disappointing Mindless Mess
","I really enjoyed Captain America, Thor, and the first Iron Man, but The Avengers is just a mostly boring, repetitive, excessively long mess of self-indulgence. You'd never know that the talented Joss Whedon directed -- the film has none of his trademark sly humor, cleverness or pacing.Instead we get a needlessly long film short on everything but action. While Mark Ruffalo is excellent as Bruce Banner / The Hulk, the rest of the cast is pretty much cardboard. Frankly, it's just a dumb film and just because it's popular does not mean it's a good film.So if you like lots of action, wooden dialog, dumb plots, and, well a lot of noise, you'll love this mess of a film. But if you expect to see a film that's better than the best episodes of Josh Whedon's 'Buffy' or want more from a film, be prepared to be disappointed.",4,8,19,28 May 2012
The Monuments Men," What a Waste
","Don't waste your time or money on this movie. Despite a stellar cast, 'The Monuments Men' is a piece of cinematic dreck, unworthy of its cast and director. Mr. Clooney's directing and acting skills went AWOL in this poor excuse for a motion picture. It is a textbook study of how to make a fascinating story dull and boring. The directing, editing, bland acting, and dreadful script suck all interest out of the movie. The only way you know there is any tension or danger is the sound track -- otherwise the actors and director fail to wring any emotion out of the high school quality script. Scenes just suddenly end. SPOILER: There is simply no tension when Matt Damon is trapped on a land mine. And when the Russian army is descending on our heroes, you could cut the tension with a limp noodle because there just wasn't any.I wish I could be more positive about this movie, given the pedigree of its cast and director. But sadly there's no escaping the undeniable mediocrity of what could, in the right hands, have been a film nearly as exciting as 'The Great Escape.' I know that is is not easy to make a good film -- and 'The Monuments Men' is the poster child for a simply bad, unentertaining motion picture.",2,3,6,8 March 2014
This Is the End," Funny, Not
","I've enjoyed a slew of films Seth Rogan co-wrote or acted in, only to feel mislead, betrayed, and lied to by the critics who praised this tasteless and largely humorless (except to teenagers and those with teenage tastes)film so vociferously (yes, I'm addressing you Michael Phillips and you Richard Roeper -- you lied). While I found about 10 gags to be genuinely hilarious, most of it was repetitive, vulgar solely for the shock value of being vulgar, and largely incoherent. With the exception of Emma Watson's tongue-in-cheek (on the face, not on the butt where most of the jokes landed) performance, the acting was sub-par for a Seth Rogan flick. I can see how teens could like it, but don't call this a 'good' film in any way. Adults of any age, beware.",1,19,42,5 July 2013
Zootopia," Far more than just a cartoon
","While Zootopia was a very entertaining and pleasant surprise, it is far more than just an animated police procedural.I don't know how the Disney people did it, but Zootopia is a brilliant political allegory (and sadly I don't think I was able to satisfactorily define the term for my 7 year old grandson who just loved the sloths in the film). Somehow they anticipated today's politics with the government initiated outcasting of predator animals, losing their government jobs, being shifted to positions where they'd have no contact with the public. Somehow they anticipated a 'new' politician ready, willing, and able to do to some animals pretty much what that monster Mr. Trump wishes to do to all Muslims. Somehow they anticipated the rampant stereotyping in which Mr. Trump engages.The political allegory enables this film to transcend its genre and make it a pretty important film given the sorry state of American politics today -- a state made all the more sorry by the GOP's race baiting, stereotyping, and general hatred of anybody who disagrees with it.",8,4,16,13 March 2016
Knives Out," Unless you're a 'who dun it' fan, skip Knives Out
","Seriously, if you're not a big fan of mysteries, skip this decidedly mediocre film. If you are a big fan, see it -- you will enjoy the flick. It was hard to stay awake for the first 2/3 of the movie as it meandered along. Aside from the lead actress being adorable and Daniel Craig miraculously maintaining his southern accent throughout the film, there was little to draw a viewer's attention. The final third got interesting and at times compelling even to a non-fan of mysteries. But I'd have rather seen an important and thoroughly mesmerizing compelling film like 'Dark Waters' a second time to seeing 'Knives Out' even once.That is, unless you are a big fan of the who dun it genre. My wife, who is such a fan, really enjoyed this frequent mess of a movie. I suppose if the film had come with a scorecard and the players names on the backs of their 'uniforms,' it may have been possible for laypeople (i.e. not big 'who dun it' fans) to make sense of what was happening.",3,4,12,23 December 2019
The Irishman," It's the emperor's new clothes
","I may be a fan of Scorcese, DeNiro, Pacino and Pesci, but this film is ne of their worst. The acting - except for Joe Pesci - is simply terrible with Pacino the worst in his way off one note impersonation of Jimmy Hoffa. The film is often incomprehensible. I am at a loss why anybody is praising this embarrassing mess of a movie. The extremely fine cinematography does not make up of a jumbled plot, poor acting from Pacino and Deniro, and a general mess of a movie. This emperor really is naked.",3,5,10,13 December 2019
About Time," Just a Sheer Delight
","My wife and I saw 'About Time' at a special preview at our local theater, knowing almost nothing about the film. Maybe that's one of the reasons it was so immensely enjoyable. The film is not predictable -- you never really know where it's going. There was something incredibly natural about the film. The acting, directing, writing -- they all felt natural, missing the usual phony contrivances so typical of Hollywood. This may have been Rachel McAdams' finest performance yet -- it didn't feel like she was acting and she certainly wasn't anything remotely like her role in 'Midnight in Paris.' The central family was relatively normal (pun intended) and not dysfunctional. The father and mother were real treats. The considerable humor was so, natural -- not forced, guttural, or contrived. And the occasional tears of sadness and joy that flowed in the viewers' eyes were natural as well -- not forced, not manipulated. I deliberately didn't want to give away anything about the plot and where the film goes, for the fresh path it takes is part of the joy of viewing this refreshing and very entertaining film.",9,2,6,24 October 2013
Hugo," Not My Favorite, But Definitely the Best Flick of 2011
","Tonight I saw Hugo for the second time in 3-D. My wife dragged me to it the first time and I was thoroughly blown away and moved. But I really didn't need to see it again. She did. So with little reluctance, I saw it again and it was even better the second time. This time you could appreciate the art and lyricism of this film ever more than the first time. The second time you're just blown away by not only the beauty of the opening scene, but also by the structure and art of it as the breathtaking tracking shot focuses on nearly every major and minor character in the film. And then they show the opening credits! While Hugo isn't my favorite film of the year (that was Midnight In Paris, which I'd see for a third time in a flash), I am convinced it's the 'best' film. I've seen 'The Artist' and it's not even in the same league as 'Hugo.' 'Hugo' has great direction, ensemble acting (seriously, why isn't there an Oscar for best acting ensemble?), cinematography, music, special effects, sound, use of 3-D, and heart of any film my wife and I have seen all year. It's an amazing homage to the early film makers without ever getting cloying or worshipful. It's a wonderful story on so many levels and it's impossible not to shed a tear or two among all the laughs and emotion. I realize Hugo isn't everybody's cup of tea, but taking into account its wonderful storytelling, direction, etc. it strikes me as the best of all the films nominated for 'Best Picture.'",10,4,11,11 February 2012
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Overhyped and underwhelming - and I usually love Tarrantino Filems
","While I generally love Tarantino films, 'Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood' left me cold. I was expecting something great. Instead he gives us a bit of a mess filled with forced 1960s references, really forced, unlike 'American Graffiti' which just melded them into the fabric of the film. Even the afterscene was forced and certainly not worth waiting for.Yes the acting was generally pretty darned good. Yes, the camera work was dazzling. But the film just seemed superficial and artificial.I realize there are plenty of folks who just adored the film and concluded it was innovative and clever beyond belief. I fear those conclusions are as superficial as this film.So if you're a fan of Tarrantino films, this could go either way for you. If you don't buy into the hype, you very well may enjoy it. But iIf you're not a fan of his films, this one isn't likely to turn you into a fan. Better you should rent 'Reservoir Dogs.'",5,574,970,5 August 2019
There's Something About Mary," Surprise! Superbly written, well directed
","Some brothers finally grow up! I've tried to watch the Farley Brothers' other films, but turned them off after 20 minutes -- they just were not funny ('Dumb & Dumber' being the prime example).But 'There's Something About Mary' is a real eye opener. The script, acting, and directing are really top notch, especially the script. The brothers Farley have matured and produced a genuinely hilarious movie that I will admit I've seen 4 times and would see again, preferably in a theater. Outside of one or two superfluous scenes, nothing is wasted in the film. And the use of Jonathan Richmond as the 'Cat Balloo' style singing narrator (okay, he ain't no Nat King Cole or Stubby Kaye) is inspired. Everything clicks, unlike the Farleys' earlier films which, as best I can tell, appealed only to the dumbest and dumberest (such words) among us.",8,0,0,9 December 1998
La La Land," Fun, But Doesn't Live Up to the Hype
","Unlike Bruce Springsteen in 1973 (and beyond), 'La La Land' just doesn't live up to the hype. I love a good musical (and it's only fair to put this in perspective - subjectively speaking my favorite musicals include South Pacific (film and play), Singin' in the Rain (objectively best film musical), Miss Saigon, My Fair Lady (film), Little Shop of Horrors, Les Miz (play; the film was mediocre at best), and the musical scenes in Gremlins 2).But while 'La La Land' was generally fun, it lacked memorable tunes and outside of the two leads and J.K. Simmons, I'm having trouble remembering any of the other characters. While the 'alternative universe' section near the end was very moving, the rest of the film just lacked soul.I think it's so successful due, in part, to the hype and the mental depression more than half the voters are in following the monster's election Nov. 8. It's escapism that is badly needed. And its success also comes in part from the dumbing down of the American people (which accounts in large part for the results of Nov 8) most of whom wouldn't recognize a high quality musical.I suspect the film will do well in the awards season, but if it garners the Oscar for 'Best Picture,' it will be another miscarriage of justice like 'The Artist' winning over 'Hugo' and 'Gandhi' and 'Chariots of Fire' winning at all.",6,6,13,8 January 2017
Les Misérables," A Mixed Bag -- Great Songs and Singers, but Miscasting Abounds
","I really enjoyed the stage version of Les Miserables. And I love the CD I made of the most enjoyable 70 minutes of the music. But the film is a real mixed bag. I had forgotten that much of the music is simply terrible -- boring, unmemorable, and ponderous -- and overshadowed by the 70% of the music that is simply outstanding. This is quite a switch from great musicals of the past like 'South Pacific' and 'My Fair Lady' that had only a dud or two amongst their brilliant scores.Some performances, though, were simply outstanding. Ann Hathaway and Samantha Barks, both sang with aplomb and really acted while they sang. They went beyond mere singing to give a clinic in how to perform a song in a musical production.At the opposite end of the spectrum were the badly miscast Russell Crowe who not only sings poorly, but did not act. He was stiff as a board throughout. Even worse were Sasha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter as the villainous Thénardiers -- badly miscast and poorly sung. I can't understand why the producers didn't cast a pair of Thénardiers from the stage production. Nobody bought a ticket to the movie to see Cohen or Carter. In their hands, 'Master of the House' lost all of its devilish charm. Their casting leaves me very apprehensive about the all-star casting of Tracy Lett's Steppenwolf Theater blockbuster 'August: Osage County.' My wife and I were privileged to see the original production at Steppenwolf in Chicago and we have great difficulty picturing Julia Roberts and even Meryl Streep (who will probably do quite well) in key roles in that play. When will producers realize that some stage actors really do own their roles and should be cast in the film? Director Tom Hooper really fouled up the entire film by shooting nearly all of it in close up. It didn't work. While his direction was generally fluid and professional, the close-up conceit he maintained throughout just got in the way of the scenes, detracting from them.Equally troubling are many events in the story line. The way in which Cosette and Marius fall in deep love was simply absurd. And the way in which so many characters turned ill and quickly died was ridiculous. In the years since I saw the superb production of the play in Chicago I had forgotten some of the more absurd turns of events in Les Miserables. To really enjoy this movie, you've got to focus on the 70% of the music that made Les Miserables such a great theater-going experience.",5,8,16,31 December 2012
12 Years a Slave," Most Important -- and Perhaps Best - Film of 2013
","It's one thing to have studied slavery way back when in college and another thing to see it so accurately portrayed on the silver screen. '12 Years a Slave' was certainly the most important movie of 2013 and the most difficult to watch film in decades thanks to its spot-on depiction of the horrors of slavery in the American South. Unlike slavery in South America, it was illegal in the U.S. to teach slaves reading or writing, they could not marry, they could not gather in groups except for religious services, they could not own anything, and they were nothing more than chattel. Manumission was generally impossible. The brilliant acting, directly, and writing of '12 Years a Slave' brought this all to life. It is impossible to watch this film and not ask how we could allow the South back into the Union without executing its leaders for treason and how we cannot allow the flag of the rebels, the Confederacy to be flown within our borders. I can't think of any other nation on earth that was so forgiving to those who engaged in high treason and rebellion.That said, the acting was simply top notch. And the script -- there are not adequate words to praise the script enough. I was amazed at how the actors spoke in the manner of the day and never slipped into current styles of speech. You don't see that very often. While I think the film deserves the Oscars for Best Picture, Best Screen writing, Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Supporting Actress, I strongly suspect that like 'The Color Purple' before it, the Academy will shut it out because we Caucasian folk just cannot deal with this stain on our nation. It would be a shame because this is a film that all Americans should see, especially those radical right wingers who continue to deny the horrors of American slavery.",10,2,7,4 February 2014
