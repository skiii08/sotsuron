Requiem for a Dream," Dream Turns To Nightmare!
","Requiem for a Dream marks my first Darren Aronofsky film to date. In short, I am disappointed and has given me a bad first impression of the director. This overwrought public service announcement follows the lives of four people suffering the consequences of drug addiction. An interesting subject treated with the utmost superficiality. My major issue is with the script. It doesn't seem to be doing much except saying 'look how bad drugs are'. There's no deep or profound meaning on the subject matter and doesn't leave much for interpretation. Furthermore, I could not manage to muster an ounce of sympathy for any of the characters. The script simply lacked any real depth to make them remotely interesting or relatable. We basically just watch all of them crash and burn. It might be visually interesting but we never get to emotionally connect with any character. There's also Aronofsky's visual techniques which are quite striking at first, but after a while they get tiresome. The four principal actors do well enough given what they have to work with. Ellen Burstyn is most notable for her Oscar-nominated performance. But not even a good performance can redeem this relentlessly pretentious film. A Let Down!",4,2,5,27 May 2007
The Big Lebowski," The Big Dud
","I just had the unfortunate experience of watching The Big Lebowski for the first time. All I can say is that I'm amazed at its popularity. It's hard to comprehend people actually like this overrated dud and claim it's funny and entertaining. As if the muddled and overloaded script and plot weren't enough, the characters aren't the least bit interesting to watch. Jeff Bridges' character is an unemployed loser, and for that reason alone, we're suppose to think he's 'really cool'. I bet slacker misfits must be the only ones who could identify with such character. Moreover, John Goodman's character is downright obnoxious. Julianne Moore, Steve Buscemi, and John Turturro are wasted in nonsensical roles. Plus, the laughs are few and far between. The cliff scene when John Goodman scatters Steve Buscemi's ashes but the wind blows them on to Jeff Bridges' face, is probably the funniest bit in the whole movie. Everything else seems forced. The music is forgettable and if you want a better display of Roger Deakins' cinematography, I suggest you see a better Coen brothers' film - O Brother, Where Art Thou? To think this film came from the same people who brought us Fargo and Blood Simple.",4,10,25,4 June 2007
Unbreakable," Breaking Into Pieces
","Unbreakable is a slow moving film with a twist ending that doesn't quite work. But my major problem with the film was with the villain, Elijah. He wants to find David, the guy on the other side of the spectrum and simply tell him he's super human. But Elijah's motives are never made clear. We never really learn what is his goal in seeking out David. In the end, all he does is tell David to go to a crowded train station and have some kind of psychic experience. When you stop and think about it, there's nothing in it for Elijah! Because the villain's plan makes no sense, the entire film makes no sense. On top of that, David has a decent job. He helps people for a living as a security guard. Plus, he's having marital problems. There is no logical reason for him to compound his problems by following orders from some lunatic who's been stalking him and his family. This makes the film unsatisfying - it's a big build up... to nothing. The whole comic book concept is potentially interesting but the movie's attempt at it is disappointingly flawed. On top of that, Bruce Willis appears to have overdosed on tranquilizers.",4,3,6,24 March 2007
Crash," Crash Is A Hit
","There seems to be a lot backlash against Crash. It may not have been the most deserving Best Picture winner, but I still think it's a very good film. It tells an interesting story with solid writing, acting, cinematography, and editing. For starters, the screenplay is structurally very good. Paul Haggis does a great job of connecting the stories resulting in powerful, dramatic payoffs for each character. Some scenes are gut-wrenching with emotion which moved me to tears. Matt Dillon rescuing Thandie Newton from the car wreckage and Michael Pena's little girl jumping into his arms as the gun goes off are the two most memorable scenes in the movie. The score is haunting with Bird York's In the Deep single being a beautiful addition. Most of the actors do very well. Dillon, Newton, Pena, Don Cheadle, Terrence Howard and Sandra Bullock stand out. The rest are debatable. Brendan Fraser's performance, in particular, is wooden at best. At times the dialogue can be stilted and unnatural, but the overall film is engaging and thought provoking.",8,1,4,15 April 2007
LÃ©on: The Professional," The Good And The Bad On Leon
","For every good thing about Leon: The Professional, there is an equal and opposite item that just blows it.The good news is that Leon makes for an entertaining viewing experience. Portman and Reno give really good performances, the movie is well-photographed, and the action scenes are great.The bad news is that some of the intended humor does not work at all, such as when Mathilda tells a hotel manager that Leon is her lover. Furthermore, Oldman's character is more of a caricature than a character. It's hard to believe Stansfield, a man with clear psychotic behavior, would hold such an important position in the DEA. One also has to wonder if every cop in NYC is as corrupt as Stansfield when a slew of them help him burst into an apartment, kill everyone in sight, including a 4 year-old child, all without raising any red flags. But the hardest thing to believe was how Mathilda's father, knowing what was coming, would not have had his entire family out of that apartment by noon. It seems director Luc Besson thinks it's okay to defy all logic for the sake of a plot point.",6,5,10,22 July 2007
North by Northwest," Hitchcock's thrilling game of cat-and-mouse!
","Exhilaration, anxiety, and tension all describe North by Northwest, Hitchcock's masterpiece about mistaken identity. Manhattan advertising executive Roger Thornhill is kidnapped by a gang of spies led by debonair Phillip Vandamm. Vandamm believes Thornhill is George Kaplan, a CIA agent supposedly working to stop him from exporting a valuable statue full of top-secret microfilm. After his first attempt at murdering Thornhill (or Kaplan) fails, Thorhnill is chased across the Midwest in a deadly game of cat-and-mouse. What makes this movie so much fun to watch is the fact that it starts going from frame one and doesn't stop until the very end. The action unfolds seamlessly, no scene is wasted, and even has comedic touches. This is in partly due to Ernest Lehman's rich screenplay. He wrote other films full of great dialogue ( Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf, Sweet Smell of Success) but in North by Northwest, he is at his peak. The dialogue between Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint at the train dinner table, for example, is full of awesome sexual innuendo. The Master of Suspense uses his mastery of direction by creating yet another suspenseful story full of excitement and mystery. The luscious photography and tension-building musical score are attributed to the masterminds of Robert Burks and Bernard Herrmann, respectively. Be on the look out for many unforgettable scenes--the auction scene, the crop duster scene, the Mt. Rushmore sequence and many more in between. Highly Recommended!",10,0,0,13 November 2005
Gone with the Wind," Melodrama has never been this good!
","The highest grossing movie of all time depicting a tortured love-affair in the midst of one of history's most tragic times. No, it is not Titanic! It is Gone with the Wind. The story begins in the Old South on the eve of the Civil War. Our indomitable heroine Scarlett O'Hara is a coquette belle living an idyllic life in her daddy's plantation called Tara. She professes her love to her man-of-desire Ashley Wilkes who already belongs to the wholesome Melanie. Scarlett schemes her way to win Ashley's love, but the more she does, the more it backfires. The film takes us on her journey of struggle against the consequences of the war which leads to her stormy love affair with dashing scallywag Rhett Butler. This turbulent romance is one for the books full of fiery sparks. Leigh gives one hell of a performance as one of cinema's most recognizable movie heroines. She is petulant, vain, and spiteful. But we love her, relate to her, and we care for her. Gable, de Havilland, and the rest of the cast deliver noteworthy performances but this is Leigh's show. With an unforgettable musical score, lavish sets, prodigious display of imagery, exquisite costumes, and most importantly, countless scenes offering maximum dramatic impact all combine to give ample entertainment for all. A true classic!",10,2,3,29 November 2005
Saving Private Ryan," Spielberg puts us in the midst of war!
","You know why this is one of the best war films of all time? Because Spielberg puts us right in the midst of the war! We experience the unvarnished, direct, and all the nitty-gritty details that went on in battle. I can't think of any other film of the same genre which has done this. He does this by using shaky POV camera shots, showing us graphic images of soldiers getting blown up or getting shot, brutal sound effects, etc. We also get a solid storyline with an actual plot. Our heroes have a goal and a mission to complete (besides winning the war). After a grueling 20-minute opening that depicts the horrors that went on D-Day, Capt. Miller and his crew of soldiers are assigned to rescue private Ryan, a paratrooper lost behind enemy lines. His three brothers have just been killed in action and the Army wants to send him home. This leads Capt. Miller and his crew to undertake a dangerous task with an uncertain outcome.Tom Hanks and company are excellent. They all give convincing and rather low-key performances. Giovanni Ribisi and Matt Damon are particular standouts. Another thing I loved about the film was the pacing. The balance between the ghastly battle scenes and the quiet scenes which gives us time to get to know our heroes is perfect. You hardly notice that it's a 2 hr and 50 min film. The photography by Janusz Kaminski is incredibly distinctive. It has this 'washed-out' look which makes it look like an old war newsreel. John Williams' musical score is also appropriately effective. It's not his most memorable nor as haunting like the one he did for Schindler's List but good enough to appreciate. Without a doubt, all this wouldn't have been achieved if it wasn't for Steven Spielberg's expertise. Once again, he shows us his versatility and mastery as a director to let audiences experience a story rather than just see it. I can live with the fact that the film didn't win an Oscar for Best Picture but it would have been an injustice if he hadn't won for Best Director. A great war film and one of the best of the 90's!",10,2,3,12 November 2005
City of God," An Adrenaline Rush
","On the front cover of the DVD, Roger Ebert proclaims City of God is: One of the Best Films You'll Ever See! I don't agree with some of his reviews but man, was he right on this one! It blew me away! It is an amazing true story of a young Brazilian man living in the slums of the City of God and who dreams of becoming a photographer. The camera not only keeps him in the slums but also serves as a way out. The story is told through his eyes and in the process we're introduced to some of the most interesting and complex heroes and villains to ever appear on screen. It is a tour-de-force production that has merit in many areas. From the vast array of amateur actors who did a splendid job realizing each character with raw energy to the ultra-kinetic editing and camera movement. This type of frantic editing actually contributed greatly to the effectiveness of the film. Despite some dark and even disturbing moments, director Fernando Meirelles brilliantly puts it all together. It's fast-paced, realistic, and superbly written. Without any doubt, City of God is one of the greatest foreign films ever made.",10,1,3,7 May 2007
The Incredibles," Meet the Supers!
","What's so admirable about Pixar Animation Studios is how they pay attention to the most important factor, story and the art of storytelling. The Incredibles continues the studios' long line of films that excel not only in animation, but in quality as well. Filling the screen with highly detailed and stylized images, the story introduces us to a family of superheroes. After they are forced to go undercover and live a normal suburban life, they must join and work together in order to defeat the maniacal Syndrome. The movie has a great plot that not only explores many common family issues but has lots of action and adventure that will please the young and old alike. The characters are a blast to watch because they are so well-drawn and full of life. Aside from our family of superheroes, there's fashion diva Edna Mode, 'oh-so-cool' Frozone, and obnoxious boss Gilbert Huph (perfectly voiced by Wallace Shawn). Even the smallest of characters stand out (such as Bomb Voyage). Pixar made a great investment in hiring Brad Bird. He's a very talented man who has created a popcorn masterpiece.",10,1,1,30 March 2007
Black Hawk Down," Black Hawk...Thumbs Down!
","When I watch a war movie, I expect to see lots of disturbing deaths, full-throated explosions, and rousing action. But most importantly, I expect a compelling story with strong characterizations that'll engage me for the next 2 and a half hrs. Black Hawk Down only delivered half of it! The movie's major flaw is the characters. None of them are 3-dimensional and we really have no reason to care for any of them. There are about 30 soldiers who get screen time and none of them are nearly as developed as they should be. There are many scenes showing troops reacting to the death of their fellow soldiers, the music playing in the background indicated me these were sad moments. Those scenes were intended to move me (the audience) but since I hardly knew any of them, I felt nothing but disgust, as some scenes were graphically full of gore. They were gross but not emotional. This may be war, but cinematically there is no true conflict here, no emotional investment, no setbacks to surprise, no obstacles to draw the viewer in. Nice attempt from director Ridley Scott but he definitely came up short of what he could have accomplished on this. Maybe Bruckheimer should be blamed!",5,0,2,20 November 2005
Big Fish," Something Smells Kinda Fishy!
","Let me start by saying that Tim Burton will always be a great artistic director/production designer. His movies will always carry that weird, offbeat imagery which will please fans to no end. Unfortunately, he will always be at fault for choosing such weak scripts for his projects. John August's run-of-the-mill script for Big Fish leaves much to be desired because of the shallow storytelling and flimsy characterization. Most of the characters involved are either too flat, or too deliberately odd, for the viewer to relate to. Big Fish introduces us to Ed Bloom, a man who tells some unbelievably amazing stories. But these episodic stories didn't seem to have any point other than just to flaunt Burton's visual style and twisted imagination. I failed to see young and old Bloom as inspirational or even likable, rather he came off as annoying. Old Bloom droned on for hours, talking nonsense. Young Bloom was a self-centered dolt, who always got what he wanted. His son, Will, had all the reason to resent his father, but even he came off as a jerk at times. On the bright side, the movie delivers good results in the acting department, although McGregor's southern accent isn't quite convincing. All in all, an unsatisfactory effort.",4,3,7,14 June 2007
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," A Love Worth Remembering
","Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) has just discovered his girlfriend Clementine (Kate Winslet) went to some company to have her memory of him erased. He's so devastated that he goes to that very company to have the same procedure done. During the process of erasing his memories of her, he realizes he still loves her and tries to stop the procedure.Jim Carrey, playing against type, gives his best performance to date. He shows his funny side but proves he can also be a good dramatic actor. Kate Winslet is nothing short of wonderful. She glows as the eccentric Clementine. The supporting actors all do very well, even when they're given little to do. The script by Kaufman is second to none. He pens a classic and beautiful love story in the most original and interesting way. No wonder he got the Oscar. Michel Gondry's direction is weird, to say the least, but it is imaginative and inventive.I think the message of this film is that no matter how many faults your partner may have, you can't help but love them for who they are. It's a message mostly everyone can relate to. And the actors and filmmakers make it memorable along the way. Satisfyingly Sweet!",9,1,3,28 May 2007
3 Idiots," I Laughed! I Cried! And I'm giving this a 10!
","When I was looking through IMDb's Top 250 movie list and saw a movie called '3 Idiots', I was surprised. Why would a movie with such a bad title be voted so highly? I went in thinking this would be India's version of Animal House or American Pie. But after watching the film, I was in love! It is so much more than the usual college story of young guys getting drunk, flunking classes, and getting back at their superiors. It is an extremely well-made film about doing what you love and facing your fears. The acting is incredible by the ensemble cast. The script is funny and poignant at the same time. Even the scenery is breathtaking. Although the length of the film is pretty long and has some quirky musical numbers, 3 Idiots is a delight. It is worth the watch!",10,25,43,7 March 2013
The Untouchables," The Unrepaired!
","This movie is the perfect example of having a good premise and high production values yet having bad execution. The story is about Treasury officer Eliot Ness' recruitment of 'untouchables' and their work in defeating crime boss Al Capone. My problem with the movie was it tried to be two things at the same time; a family-friendly epic adventure and a gritty crime drama. The result was a full set of contrived and hokey scenes. There's no character development courtesy of the inane script. The actors spout off one cheesy line after another. Ennio Morricone's musical scores are always top-notch but this time the music doesn't fit quite well. The score sounds too upbeat and silly for the movie's vacillating tone. You also have an uninvolving antagonist in the form of Robert De Niro. All we get from him is long speeches that have nothing to do with the main plot. His scenes didn't advance the story. They only exist to show off De Niro as Capone. Furthermore, Sean Connery's performance isn't Oscar-caliber and Kevin Costner isn't convincing as Ness. Andy Garcia showed promise, but like I mentioned earlier, the screenplay didn't develop him or anybody enough for me to care. And what's worse, you get an implausible resolution set in a court room. It's a fast-paced movie with stylish images but not as great as some might suggest.",5,6,13,13 November 2005
Back to the Future," 'Wait a minute, Doc, are you trying to tell me that my mother has got the hots for me?'- Marty
","This has got to be one of the coolest movies ever made and the pinnacle of 80's popcorn cinema! High school teenager Marty McFly is sent back to 1955 through a DeLorean time machine invented by his friend, nutty scientist Doc Emmett Brown. Once there, he inadvertently changes the course of time. He must now do everything he can in order to bring his parents back together or he and his siblings will be erased from existence. He must also fight off school bully Biff Tannen and ultimately get back to the future. Director and co-writer Robert Zemeckis gives us pure solid entertainment with excellent pacing, likable characters, and a cleverly-written screenplay. The special effects are also exceptional. Twenty years later, they still look fresh and new. Zemeckis also succeeds in bringing to life an idealized and nostalgic 1950's look. Furthermore, the movie is filled with great performances. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are superb and have great chemistry together. Crispin Glover, Lea Thompson, and Thomas F. Wilson are also splendid in their underrated performances. Alan Silvetri's musical score and a couple of songs from Huey Lewis and the News are also enjoyable and serve their purpose to heighten the excitement. This is such a great movie for people of all ages. It personally holds a special place in my heart because of the fond memories it brings. I've seen it countless times since I was a kid and it never gets tiring. A must see for all!",10,1,2,10 November 2005
The Wizard of Oz," Greatest fantasy trip of all time!
","Movies like this usually come once in a lifetime. It's been over 60 years and people still watch it in admiration. New generations are also discovering and appreciating its messages of benignity, optimism, and aspiration. The story is simple, Dorothy and her beloved dog Toto are transported to the brightly-colored world of Oz after a tornado hits Kansas. She wants to get home but must first follow the yellow brick road leading to Emerald City where only one person can help her--The Wizard of Oz. Along the way, she makes three best friends in the form of a talking Scarecrow, a heartless Tin Man, and a Cowardly Lion. She also faces wits with the Wicked Witch of the West who is after those magical ruby slippers. Everything about this film is superlative. The cinematography is gorgeous. We start off in a black and white Kansas where the landscape looks dry and desolate. Then the film transitions to an eye candy Technicolor world called Oz. It also has ingeniously-written musical numbers performed by some of the greatest talents of yesteryear. Judy Garland leads a wonderful cast full of paramount performers. Ray Bolger, Bert Lahr, and Jack Haley are unforgettable as Dorothy's three sidekicks. Frank Morgan (in 5 roles) is terrific and Margaret Hamilton is wickedly fun as Miss Gulch and the Wicked Witch of the West. Kudos to the director (or directors) for creating such an endearing film that brings jolly entertainment to people of all ages. This is by far, the greatest fantasy, musical, adventure, moral story of all time!",10,2,4,13 November 2005
