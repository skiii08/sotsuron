Antz," Intelligent movie, beautiful animation
","Antz is an intelligent movie, with wonderful humor, a moral and lots and lots of citations and references.And it's also the most beautiful computer animation I've ever seen. Each character is carefully designed. Not only the mimic (which I've never seen the likes in computer animation) and the movements - even the texture of each ant's body seems to be individual. And the characters were so convincing, they seemed almost livelier than their models (I liked that Christopher Walken Ant a lot - well, I'm a bit of a darksider :-)",10,0,0,12 November 1998
Shakespeare in Love," Shakespeare's passion reinvented!
","When we read Shakespeare in school, I was never able to find the enthusiasm his works aroused in the Elizabethan England. This film has captured it!As a German I might have missed a word now and then, but many of the dialogues were easy to recognize from various plays, and this time they did not seem outdated, but brilliant, not over-exaggerated, but genuinely passionate and beautiful. This film has restored Shakespeare's fame for another millennium to come.And it is terrifically comical, too, and JudiDench as the Queen is plainly magnificent.",10,0,1,25 May 1999
