The Blair Witch Project," hmmm...
","I'm wondering if i saw the same film as some other people who are so eager to make it a classic. It's not. The camera idea does nothing but cause people to get sick, the only scary idea (that it could be true) was ruined before the release, and the ending left many disappointed. When I saw it, everyone in the theater wanted their money back. I could see how it might scare some, but its not a good movie, unless of course you have a thing for sticks and rocks.",Null,0,0,7 September 1999
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," A Dramatic improvement
","I will have to admit I was skeptical going into my viewing of Episode II, after the disappointment of Episode I. However, I was pleasantly surpirsised by the film. In many respects, Lucas has returned to those elements which made his prior films a success. As you would expect, there are familiar faces, as well as new characters, and an explosive action finale. While no one may be surprised at the superior effects, it is actually the story of the inner struggle of Annakin, a momentous task to handle, that the film captures well. Performances are not as stale in this film, and it is a great improvement. This is a film Lucas can take some pride in. 7/10",7,0,0,16 May 2002
The Godfather: Part II," What a film should be
","WoW! When i saw this movie, i was amazed. Coppola continues the riveting Corleone saga between pacino's Michael and deniro's Young Vito. Both have never been better, and the supporting cast is amazing. The film did not seem the nearly three and a half hours that it was. Also, I thought that scenes between Michael and Fredo were among the best i've seen. Along with Citizen kane, Lawrence of Arabia, and casablanca, this film, which somehow manages to outdo the first one (a great film in its own right), could possibly be the best I've ever seen.",10,0,0,9 August 1999
