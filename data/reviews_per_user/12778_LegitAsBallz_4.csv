E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," A staple of childhood memories.
",Who has watched the film has to remember the joyous moment when ET and Elliot and friend take to the skies in a epic sunset completed with the amazing John Williams score. John Williams score is the stitching that keeps this classic together. Remember the famous line of 'ET Phone Home.' Whoever wrote this should get some award. The script has simple word the convey deep. 'Ouch' 'Be Good.' Let the innocence and the John Williams score take you into great heights.Please Note: This movie is further proof of how the Oscars always stiff the best film.Another Note: Thank you Steven for not creating a sequel. It would have been bad and completely wrecked the creditability of the original!,10,0,1,13 August 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Ouch, Painful, Bad
","The first pirates was a 8. The next one was a 5 and this one is a 3. The joy with the first one was the wittiness and fun factor. Though with these later installments have tried, (and failed) to be serious movies. The backstabbing was endless. You soon lost whose side everybody was on and stopping caring. Though I think the main backstabbing was the backstabbing of the viewers. Look they added a intriguing new twist. Remember that Caribbean lady well see not just a Caribbean lady see she's a sea goddess. That good be interesting. But you see the 'screenwriters' must have gotten bored with her because she grow 30x and explodes into crabs. Dumb 'twist' like that happen through out the film. Please avoid to not tarnish your memories of the first and real Pirates of the Caribbean!",3,1,4,13 August 2008
Transformers," Good beginning though eventually succumbing to the endless explosions at the end.
","Too many explosions too little good strong characters. It is a mystery but with all this attack on screen you think you would never get bored. Not in a million years right? Wrong.The explosions and fight went on for a solid 30 minutes, cool? No. Boring and just repetitive.Megan Fox cannot act. Shia can. Shia is what holds up the film from complete failure. A good casting move for Michael Bay. I will give this points for a good beginning. Which was intriguing and for you exploding stuff fans well it has plenty of those. And my final thoughts well this movie is for people who like stuff exploding and for people who like blockbuster fluff like this. 5 out of 10",5,0,3,13 August 2008
The Dark Knight," Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
","Christopher Nolan you just made my day. This blockbuster season I was admittedly pumped for Dark Knight and Indiana Jones. The latter I was most pumped because I love Indiana Jones. Though when that came out I was very disappointed. So I turned my eyes on the Dark Knight.Baman Begins was great (9 stars) but the Dark Knight flew above my head and soar and never looked down. It was a strong movie in almost every aspect.Story: 8 A new villain is in town, the Joker, (the late Heath Ledger) and he is trying to bring down the whole city with him at no cost. Try to corrupt the Batman, (Christian Bale) and the D.A. Harvey Dent.Acting: Great acting everywhere. Though Heath Ledger stole the show. Oscar nomination time! Above average acting from every one except for Maggie G. which was average.Script: Great one liners, not cheesy though like, (Lets kick some ICE! and 'Your not send me back to da COOLER!') have been replaced with, (Why so serious and more.) Oscar Nod Camera Work: Great Oscar Nod Music: Fits perfectly. Oscar Nod too.Overall: Amazing and is the Blockbuster of the decade. Best Picture Nod time! 10/10",10,10,21,13 August 2008
