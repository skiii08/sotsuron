The Hangover," As of 01/01/2010 it's safe to say Hangover was the funniest thing we saw in 2009!
","Well structured action, genuinely funny performances and script. The kind of comedy you would recommend to everyone without reservations! What really makes a difference here is the chemistry of the characters. If you just take a quick look at them, you will see no possible way of co-existence. Yet they not only -almost miraculously- manage to survive each other but their hangover experience works like a bonding factor. Bradley Cooper as the voice of reason and Zach Galifianakis deliberately trying to make everyone's life miserable with his 'brilliant' ideas is called Flawless Casting. It's the kind of comedy we hadn't seen since... Well, I have no idea when the last time I watched something equally funny was! Enjoy!",8,2,4,6 February 2010
