The Ring," Atmosphere
",For a movie in this genre to work effectively it has to have atmosphere. The Ring has an atmosphere of fear and dread from beginning to end.For those who got lost trying to follow the story I would suggest seeing it again. The very few aspects of the story that are left unknown make it more intriguing. The unknown is always more frightening than the known.As a psychological horror film I give this movie a 10.,10,0,0,23 November 2002
