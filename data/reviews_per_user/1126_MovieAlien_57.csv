The Blair Witch Project," What a joke!!!!
","Where are thee emperor's new clothes...I don't think I executed that overused (yet popular) saying correctly, but you'll understand what I mean if you felt the same about this rubbish.Ever been in a car on the way to your parent's house on Thanksgiving and everyone in the car just bickers, bickers, and bickers? Put that in front of a Parkinson's Patient using a handheld video camera and you have the Blair Witch Project. I'll keep this real short, because most of the negatives have already been discussed. But explain this; these three kids get lost in the woods, and even after they're terrified and at the point when survival is the number one priority, why did they continue to film the whole thing? (Even when they indulged into a few physical fights? Wouldn't they at least set the camera down?) This is amateur filmmaking at best, so shoestring and holed that it probably didn't even take a full day to square it out. You don't need a huge budget to make a good film, but if you extend your time, efforts will prove to be more thought out and worthwhile. That wasn't the case here. The premise was extremely mundane (Anyone who hasn't seen The Vanishing, Cannibal Holocaust or 84 Charlie Mopic, first, would understand), the delivery was ill-concieved and overbaked, and the characters were no less annoying than those in the common Hollywood teen horror flick. This is a rape of intelligence, money, and time. If, to you, life is a terrible thing to waste, you'll be better off avoiding this movie. I say this as a friendly suggestion.",1,2,3,12 November 1999
Erin Brockovich," Julia Roberts ruins an otherwise above-average movie
","Based on the true story of an attorney and his assistant who blew the whistle and organized a large class action lawsuit against a Northern California-based power utility company for trashing water in a small Southern California town. Albert Finney is excellent, as always, playing the lawyer. You can still notice a small English accent but those who have not seen his British movies will find it hard to tell. The supporting cast was also good; Marg Helgenberger, as one of the ailing residents, and Aaron Eckhart, who plays the biker who babysits Brockovich' kids. But Julia Roberts turns the film into damaged goods. Although the title character is not the brightest jane on the block, it seems anything Roberts plays is this arrogant, immature, obnoxious, loud bimbo. Although what she did in the movie could be easily described as heroic, Robert's portrayal often got on the nerves, making the character hard to like.",Null,0,2,19 October 2003
Se7en," A Terrible Movie
","'Disturbing' and 'gruesome' will be the first reason I did not like this. It makes you wonder how some people admire a movie despite such. And the answer you get is 'It was all stylized, like a cartoon. And it was cool.' There was nothing resembling style or 'cool' in this film; When people say this, I worry about them. But I'm not saying  violent movies are bad. 'La Femme Nikita' was style. 'Blade' (with Wesley Snipes) was cool. But Se7en is a homicidal nutcase's bedtime storybook.The second reason I did not like this movie was the lack of sympathy for the characters. Morgan Freeman has always been a wonderful actor, and his screen presence was a meager improvement for the movie. But what I really loathed was Brad Pitt. He was in a starring role as a detective who wants to investigate these cases so fast he rushes through the movie. He overacts, so much that you feel like you're watching an arrogant high school boy recite Homer's 'The Odyssey.' Pitt's self interest in film has always been an annoyance, if it were just him and another person (besides Freeman) teaming up I would have stopped this movie before it reached the ho-hum finale. When push comes to shove that you find out who the sicky is, *Kevin Spacey* look's about as threatening as a 5-year-old with a cap gun. Gwynyth Paltrow look's like a Kate Moss stand in. Countless flaws. Gratuitous gore.... I wish I new what the high rating was about...I guess some like to give bad movies a second chance.",Null,0,1,2 March 1999
Se7en," One of the worst movies ever made! Bar none!
","Nothing redeeming here. Just an endless hash of grizzly torture and murder scenes, all of which err from a very bad childhood nightmare. (And you could tell this was done as more of a shock value then for chill.) That's not the downer of this movie, there's so much more. It was poorly written, directed, acted. To explain it's betrayal of genre, there was no suspense in the movie. In order to have suspense, a character must be in peril in some way or something unpredictable and shocking must happen. Nope, not here. Scene after scene was just discoveries of these gory brutalities, all of which were boring just as they were unpleasant. An overrated movie is one thing; It's the hype and the style of a film's release. But here, I don't know why anyone would like this. It's a terrible movie!Lets look at the perfomances. There was no momentum or sympathy in any of the characters. Brad Pitt was a young smartass cop who couldn't stop using four letter words, Gwyneth Paltow delivers one of the most empty performances of the 1990s (this is someone who got the Best Actress Oscar only a few years later!) and Morgan Freeman is sadly miscast. I'm surpised he still had his contract after this. And Kevin Spacey, as the killer, geez, what a joke!Does Kevin Spacey scare you? Now, he was psychologically taunting in the Usual Suspects, but otherwise...no. If Gary Oldman, Christopher Walken, or Donald Sutherland approached me on the street, I'd be terrified. If Kevin Spacey approached me, I'd feel as if a small kitten was begging me to feed it.Why? The three other actors often play characters that are errie and macabre, eventhough they're unfortunately typecast. Spacey is only a little calmer than neurotic. Do you see the difference there?This movie was a mess. Imagine falling into a puddle of dog excrement and having the stench on you until you get home to wash it off. The after-feeling of watching 'Seven' is similar to that, except it takes a long time (or maybe never, in some cases) to clean the filth off.One of the worst movies ever made. Avoid it like the flu!",Null,0,2,27 August 1999
The Big Lebowski," Not outstanding (as a Coen brothers movie) but still worth watching.
","To point out the less obvious, John Goodman has already played a nutcase character in other Coen Brothers movies: 'Raising Arizona' (As the prison escapee) and 'Barton Fink' (as the arson-murderer). In this, he plays a disgruntled Vietnam veteran. And Steve Buscemi, for the hundredth time, plays a pedophile. It's starting to look a little tacky and routine. Maybe, now that the Coens received Academy Awards for 'Fargo' they should reconsider to hire other actors?Well, I marginally recommend this film. It seemed like another version of Fargo (kidnapping, ransom) only this was stranger and Fargo was much better. There's really little to recommend about in this movie, but it was one of the better films to be released in the early '98 year. Worth seeing once.",Null,2,4,1 August 1999
Unbreakable," Excellent concept, but poorly conceived
","As far as plot goes this will be about the most original one you see in a while, and the ending is definitely unpredictable. However, there was one fundamental problem about this movie. It was very, very slow. In actuality I have no problems with slow movies. In themes that deal with loss and uncertainty it can actually add great atmosphere. But this movie wasn't about that: it was about trauma and awe, which would likely involve a faster pace. In many parts it didn't take itself seriously (Bruce Willis' character plays a security guard on a cross country trip for a security guard job interview) and considering the deliberate pace it made it seem kind of ridiculous. My greatest misgiving is the fact many parts were left in that should have been left out and parts were left out that should have been in: The DVD Special Edition has 3 deleted scenes: One with Willis' character having a mental breakdown in a bathtub, one with Jackson's character as a small boy facing a very dehumanizing situation at a carnival, and the third with Willis' character having a heated argument with the Priest at his parish about the train derailment. Since the characters otherwise seemed wooden and emotionless, adding these scenes would have made the movie so much more profound and powerful, and perhaps may touch base on some questions that were otherwise left unanswered throughout the film.  Although a very fascinating picture, it was flawed by a leisure pace that was extremely inappropriate, and it was too vague in trying to encompass the events and how they effected the characters in the film.",Null,0,0,24 December 2001
Citizen Kane," The dark side of the American dream
","Citizen Kane is truly an excellent film. Before you mistake this review for another empty 'This is a classic, see it, best movie ever made' rundown I advise anyone who hasn't seen 'Citizen Kane' yet to read on, because I'll be very informative about what makes this a fantastic movie. You see, people who write vague reviews are only supplementing their true opinion with what they are egged on to believe by other people. 'The Godfather' is a prime example of that, as every positive IMDb user review with the exception of two or three comprehends what they really thought of the film. The rest is simply rambling from twits who were either enamored with the hype or simply excited by those Italian accents and sadistic violence. (As you will see, I do not recommend 'The Godfather.' see my review. Although I feel exactly the opposite about 'Citizen Kane', I'm sure it has (and will continue to have) the same amount of vague comments.) I saw 'Citizen Kane' on the impetus of its tagline as a landmark film and that Orson Welles' directed it. I did not know it was on the IMDb Top 10 or how many awards it won. Citizen Kane is an early examination of the American goal of industry. Charles Foster Kane starts out as a not so successful child, nurtured by connections and networking into one the richest publishers ever to walk the face of the earth. Loosely based on the career of William Randolph Hearst, who faced a similar not so glamourous remainder of his life, but unlike Kane he was a Nazi and an anti-Communist. As an actor Orson Welles is a chameleon and extremely unforgettable in the role of one man who had everything but one thing money can't buy. I advise you to watch Citizen Kane if you have not seen it already and to keep in mind that it was made in a totally different time period in America. Every decade (and century), a one of a kind movie will be released, and while I can't say Citizen Kane is the best movie ever made, it deserves Top 5 recognition as one of the best films of the 20th century.",Null,1,4,26 March 2002
Memento," Complex and fascinating film, probably the best of 2001
","I would like to begin by answering common problems some had with this.'How can he remember his wife dying if he has this condition?'On several occasions we are reminded that the last thing Leonard remembers is the struggle in the bathroom, getting his head slammed against a mirror, and lying sideways on the floor facing his brutalized wife.
'How can he remember that he has this condition?'That's a good question, and you could go two ways: suspend disbelief or assume that he had a note or tattoo somewhere reminding him of his short-term memory loss. Or maybe it was acquired through instinct, as told in the story of the accounting executive Sammy Jenkins. Make something up. This is a picture that you will have to see many times despite what is revealed at the end of the film (or the opening of the story which is at the end, as this is all told backwards.) It's not how it first appears - the actions of all the characters, however brief they may be, all play an important role in what goes on.I'm not going to give anything away. See it for yourself.Deserved way more Oscar noms - for the directing, acting, and best picture for such slick production on a tight budget.",Null,0,1,18 March 2002
Shakespeare in Love," Where's the barf bags when you need them...
","Trivial. Inane. Predictable. Unoriginal. Trite. Just few of many words for which I describe 'Shakespeare In Love.' This will not change the amount of Academy Awards it received. What's done is obviously done. But it will certainly stand as an embarrassment to society. How many Oscars did it actually receive? Do you remember the movie that sniped the 'Best Picture' Oscar in 1997? See, even that is leaving our memory! We don't want to remember those shameful events in the history of our time: Slavery, the Holocaust, Nixon's stand on Vietnam. Yet they still existed, and will be remembered as the inhumanity and bastardness of mankind. Unfortunately, I have to compare that to the ignorance and selfishness of the Academy of Motion Pictures.Gee, where do I start. How about where all the Oscars went. Judi Dench received a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for sitting on a chair and laughing, and as far as I could tell, for nothing much else. Gwyneth Paltrow won the Best Actress Oscar for reading her lines and flaunting her slender flat-chested body, and for a performance that makes Bo Derek look like Emma Thompson. The script, which suffered from emptyness and repetition (how many times did we have to hear the line 'A plague on both our houses'?) got the screenplay Oscar, a travesty which could of been written by a hyperactive 4th grader. Lastly, (or at least to sum it up) the Best Picture Oscar was slapped down on a 'romance film' which exposes playright William Shakespeare as being a plagiarist, and getting the idea of'Romeo and Juliet' from a love affair he supposedly had with Gwyneth Paltrow. Spare me.I'm baffled that people say this is a good portrayal of 16th Century England. No tooth paste was around back then, and bathing wasn't too sophisticated either. Yet everyone in the movie looked so clean-cut; some even appeared as if they jumped right out of a GAP commercial. The sets were obviously Hollywood sets. Everyone was playing themselves. The romance between Fiennes and Paltrow had the same amount of chemistry as the gloomy days of Charles and Di, and all the scenes and continuity were predictable. I also never laughed, despite the promotion of this as being a 'comedy'. For instance, take the scene at the begining where Phillip Henslowe (Geoffrey Rush) has a debt to pay and a group of loan sharks threaten to burn his feet or cut his nose off. I didn't find any comic relief in this scene. Was I supposed to?I have a confession to make. I only saw 30 minutes of this movie and I didn't rewind it when I returned it to the rental place. If you're wondering why I'm writing this review if I didn't watch the whole thing, it's because I knew what was going to happen for at least every 5 minutes. That's not entertaining; that's irratating. So, what's the point? The majority of the public wanted 'Saving Private Ryan' to get the much deserved Best Picture Oscar. That sampling fell on deaf ears, and the AMP took it upon themselves to choose on their own. If I ever find out the group of personalities that made that decision, I'm never going to watch their movies (or anything affiliated with them) again. I mean, this is totally ridiculous! I've made the same pact about watching future televised Oscar ceremonies. There's really no point. They're going to pick a romance period movie with an anglo-saxon cast as the best picture. It's been working like this for over a half a decade now! Why, why bother? If a poorly written, cliched sappy romance is what qualifies as 'best picture of the year', I've made up my mind. Three hours of television time could be used more wisely!Don't make the same mistake I did by wasting time and money on this vile piece of donkey dung.",Null,0,1,20 August 1999
The English Patient," Disregard the good reviews...this movie was AWFUL.
","Here's an interesting point: Almost every picture that ever won the best picture Oscar has a place in the IMDb top 250. Except one. You know which one that is? It shouldn't be hard to guess. Right now, it has an average 7.1 in it's scale. That's much closer to 6 than it is to 8. If this movie is so good, then why does it have such a rank, and why is it isolated from the other 'Best Pictures'? Simple. It is a mediocre movie, lavished by critics and audience alike because of the 'love story.' Not all love stories are good, which is unarguable, yet the only reason people say they love this movie is because it was a 'beautiful love story.' Beautiful it was not. The characters were cold, calculated, and the love story in it is  an affair between two amoral people. The woman is cheating on her husband, and her lover is a German allied spy during WWII. But that's not all. He turns an entire town over to Nazis. When people ask 'what's to hate about this movie,' the film really speaks for itself. Either that, or the people who rave about this movie are just liking it based on the good reviews. This is a Hollywood movie, covered in a false glaze that gives it the apperance of an 'art house' film. If you're going to like this movie, at least give a good reason. In my opinion this movie was boring, scornful, with only two saving graces, which is Juliette Binoche and Naveen Andrews' very touching performances. But that's as far as I'll go.A lobotomy without painkillers is preferrable compared to watching this trash.",1,59,116,1 April 2000
The English Patient," Kudos to all who gave this movie a negative review...
","And my pity to all those out there who can't help but rave about this. It's quite clear that this film is either one you love or hate, but one point to make is that it does not depend on the person who watches it. Be it a child, an American, or someone from Europe, there's no such determination, which is as prejudiced as the people who commented earlier, as to 'why someone would or would not like it.' It really disgusts me when someone says you don't like a movie because you're 'American' or that you 'did not understand it.' I understood this burnt piece of money dung of a movie really well; The thing I don't understand is why it is loved by so many people...It seems whenever I ask someone why they liked this, I never get a reasonable answer. Just because this was a filmization from a (Michael Ondjante) romance novel does not neccesarily make it a good movie. A novel and a movie are two different things. I, personally, am not a fan of the 'lovers-broken-apart' genre, but that is not why I loathed the tripe. I loathed this film simply because it was an overlong, over hyped, unsympathetic piece of grunge with no admiral protagonist. If it was based on a novel by Tom Wolfe, Clive Barker, or Anne Rice it would still make no difference to me whatsoever.There was NO point to this crap. What was beautiful about it? The fact they filmed scenes of deserts? The fact it was about an amoral man who has an affair with his best friend's wife, get's burned up in a place crash and rambles to a nurse about what happened?  What most don't understand is just because a movie is about love and romance, does not make it good. Would you find this film beautiful if it was about two race sumpremacy people having an affair? There's a question you might want to answer. The whole idea of that plot nuance makes me grimace and puke.There was no chemistry whatsoever, Ralph Fiennes looked about as wooden, stiff and emotionless as a horse in a pose of rigor mortis, Thomas looked as if she had consumed prozac when she was premenstrual. They were not beautiful, Fiennes was portrayed as an evil spy who sells out to the Nazis, and Thomas played a cold flaky woman committing adultery.I was jealous of the people who sat next to me in the theater and got their money refunded just because they had known someone who worked in the theater. In that sense, yes. Otherwise, no. Well done, no.The only other noticeable credit of the director (Anthony Minghella) was Truly Madly Deeply. I was scratching my head as to how and why such a big time magnate like Saul Zaentz would work with such a no-name. Unfortunately, I don't know why it is and how that happened. If I knew, I would be very rich.When Zaentz entered the stage gloating at what the ignorance of the Academy did for him, I imagined that he would go home that night, snicker, and think how some people's stupidity could mean another person's benefit. If you did so many great films in the past, you're bound to be smart and feature a new project to the public without any complaints, right?This movie has the relevance and value of a  watery bowel movement after it just came out of the toaster oven. It would have made no difference if the film was actually about that.If you haven't already seen it, avoid this movie at all costs. You'll be doing yourself a very big favor.",1,21,41,25 February 1999
The English Patient," Flush this poop of a movie down the toilet
","Beautiful? Powerful? Lovely? Memorable? Entertaining? Marvelous? Nope. Why are so many people attracted to this pointless, boring, contrived, and insensitive film? These characters weren't memorable! We have some chick cheating on her husband with some 'Brit' (Yet he's not British, as we find out in the movie). So you can't really  care about her. And then there's the 'Brit,' who's actually a spy, and this all takes place during WWII. It is all told as a story, from the point of view of an ill-mannered, burned up guy, blabbering on and on to the simple nurse caring for him.  Later, some thumbless loser joins them, along with a couple guys in a rundown monastery. And they all feel sorry for themselves. Mix 'The Breakfast Club', and 'Ishtar,' together, and you get this. This is what the entire movie consists of. Say good-bye to three wasted hours of your time. Say good-bye to 9 wasted Academy awards. And say good-bye to your possible interest in seeing any other movie. Finding out why this movie was raved about so much will be just as easy as understanding why the mediocrity of Hollywood has gone as far as it has.Never before has a movie caused so much pain on the audience.The purpose of a movie was to watch.

","This is one of those movies where you walk out of the theater and say 'WHAT?', only this time it's a 'WHAT?', and a hearty bunch of laughs, because it took home a heck of a lot of Oscars.  Best picture winner of 1994? Forrest Gump. Best Picture of 1995? Braveheart. Best Picture of 1996? You know, if I didn't post this movie review I probably would never had guessed. Isn't that funny?If this movie is aimed to the so-called 'Intellectual Crowd,' then why hasn't that bunch summed up an 'Intellectual Reason' as to why they liked it? I've noticed a lot of comments in the Northen European hemisphere giving this a good review, I can't decide whether it's actually that or if I'm surrounded by a bunch of comments by the same person liking The English Patient.I was not expecting car chases, explosions, or action at all. I was just expecting a decent story about how innocence is stolen by warfare and evil, and how two people are separated from such. I interpreted the opposite. The film was about two bad people, and how one big bad thing keeps them away from something they want. In film, you could cheer for the villains  when they're the protagonist, but when they're not interesting, it's quite difficult. On top of that, it was just an all around boring movie. This was the case for the English Patient. The only thing it proved was that Ralph Fiennes tops as  being a #1 self-centered pretty boy.If you ever get recommendations to see this, and have not already seen it, my kind favor is that you ask the 'suggestor' why it may be good. I could guarantee you will get an answer like 'Beautiful, Brilliant, and Great.' When you get an answer like that, you will understand they don't want to go into specific detail.

The English Patient," AN INSULT TO THE CREATION OF CINEMA !!!!!!!!!!!
","And I'm not saying this because of my age, my gender, or where I'm from. In fact, that's completely irrelevant. Beautiful and Overblown imagery doesn't compensate for an otherwise boring movie, with selfish, cardboard-cutout characters and no one to stand up for in the finale. Why did S&E like this? Why did the Academy give this 9 Oscars? Could anyone make a deliberately paced WWII romance movie with despicable characters any day and get the same undeserved recognition? I just don't get it.If this was supposed to be some sort of a philosophical message movie, I'm still not impressed. That's  because this film wasn't a statement, or an epic, or an actual romantic period piece.

Elizabeth," Disappointing.
","Whenever a movie is hyped about, I do my best not to expect very much when I see it, so perhaps I'll go along with the hubbub without a problem. But unfortunately, that didn't work (and seeing The English Patient was a prime example of that). Despite being well done, 'Elizabeth R' is a melodramatic soap opera which results to an overraught travesty.You don't need to be a history buff to see the inaccurancies: What's with the miniature subplot involving transvestism? How could someone be poisoned by wearing a dress? Why did they show cheap editing of Blanchet looking in the mirror and talking to herself? I don't want to bore you with all the detail, because otherwise I'll give the movie away, but aside from all the colorful costumes, campy performances and severed heads, this movie had nothing to offer, except a good performance by Kate Blanchet portraying Elizabeth I.Luckily this only got mixed reviews, compared to hype on other over-produced 'period' dramas.",Null,0,0,4 August 1999
Blade," Brilliantly filmed, stylish, and nothing close to Hollywood.
","Brilliantly filmed, stylish, and nothing close to Hollywood. Thus making 'Blade' an excellent film. Hollywood doesn't make movies like this anymore, you got the standard bad guy-hostage-shoot-em-up-revenge with movie stars who can't act, and that's about it. But Blade is totally different. The way it combines a horror movie and a slapdash kung fu movie was totally dope. I can't describe this movie in one word, but it's definitely a film that's complicated to not like.Finally, Wesley Snipes does not play Wesley Snipes.After the aimless, dumb, morally illicit 'Money Train,'I almost lost all respect for Snipes' acting. I was barely able to tell that this was Wesley Snipes, I didn't know Deacon Frost's Vampiress was played by Traci Lords until the end credits, and Kris Kristoferson was only recognizable through his accent. The only thing I would object to this movie was Dorff's villain, who did not seem villainous nor threatening enough, but just a young,  foul mouthed meglomaniac with an inferiority complex. There were some flaws in the movie, but none that were noticeable or as obvious as the turkey Money Train. Recommended for an audience with a strong stomach, Blade is quite violent, but not gratuitously. It is all stylized, however, and not graphic.There was one perky scene in the movie, I'm not going to give it away for those who haven't seen it, but it's clearly obvious that 'Java the Hut' served as an inspiration!",Null,0,1,10 January 1999

 I must be the first to admit, however, that the G rating should have been a PG - not to be prudent, but there are many elements in the film - language, themes, etc. - that would have raised it to a PG. ('Creature Comforts', although accessible, is clearly not an all-ages film either.)Hilarious, amusing, the animals/people never sung (which was good), a splendid cast of voices including Mel Gibson, Julia Sawalha ('Absolutely Fabulous') Timothy Spall (Mike Leigh films) and Natasha Richardson as Mrs. Tweedy, the villainous farmer.",Null,0,0,2 February 2002

Peter Doyle was excellent as wizard, Bickle's confidante, as was Cybil Sheperd as the campaign manager, and Harvey Kietel as the street pimp. Jodie Foster was the film's downside, her character was much too quirky, far-fetched, and unfocused. (And the ending seemed a little quick.) but overall, an excellent flick.

This is what this movie is: A chunk of young Hollywood stars who who prefer good looks over performance,  in a modern day action movie filled with MTV-styled pop music, speaking 16th century English and you let a drunk 14 year old film it all, handheld.

Perhaps that's excusable because the film wasn't really based on a true story, but you might feel 'left out dry' if you don't like cliffhanger endings. On the contrary, this film was still very good. All the performances were excellent, and the story keeps you interested all the way through. In other movies there will be parts that are slightly dull, but this is riveting from start to finish. What especially made it good is that you'll find a new thing everytime you watch it, much like The Usual Suspects. This had all the qualifications needed for the Best Picture Oscar and it's unfair that it didn't receive it.

","If there's any movie more persuasive in being a pseudo-arthouse potboiler, it would be Luc Besson's 'The Professional......... I'm really irked about this because I unfortunately agree with Leonard Maltin this time!There's a meager but blatant difference between the idea of what is an 'art house movie' and what isn't.  'Art house' movies take a plot nuance that has never been used before and gives it an offbeat point of view. A good amount style, mixed in with substance. But The Professional was a facade of such. There were elements used many times before;  I almost saw it as Besson wanting it to be a sequel to 'La Femme Nikita' (Which I marginally liked) except 'Nikita' was 100 times more superior to this. 'La Femme Nikita' was riveting, even without the action, and 'The Professional/Leon' wasn't.The relationship between Reno and Portman was laughable as it was pointless and contrived. Did Luc want to film a movie about an assassin or a pedophile hitman? Personally, even if this was supposed to be a 'work of art' there was no message at the end and no character that you could stand up for. Perhaps an intelligent explanation by Besson would work...........Why everyone is  raving about this movie, thou art never know!",Null,1,5,27 March 1999

When Willis chases Affleck on the oceanic oil rig in the inept opening scene, camera angles of the chase are very choppy; thank goodness for the creation of digital slow-mo on DVD because one frame reveals perfectly well that the 'rig' is a little closer inland - probably near a studio backlot. However, the sound editing is what really boggled up the movie. I don't know if it was the quality of my speakers but whenever an explosion occurred in the movie there was a static hum in the background, or the sound seemed dimmer than it should be. The cast wasn't given much to work with. Bruce Willis played the thug he always plays, Steve Buscemi makes the best he can with a bad script and his signature neurotic pedophile roles. And Liv Tyler proves that nepotism is an excellent alternative to a day job in Hollywood. And as for 'action': If waiting for an insect to get lodged into a Venus fly trap is time well worth-waiting, then put this flop on your list of exciting must-sees.",Null,0,1,15 January 2002

If you're the type of person easily broiled by countless flaws, that's a whole other story.I found myself 20 minutes into the movie not enjoying it, but counting flaws. Sure, a movie could be really fun even with a few loopholes here and there, but 'Face/Off' had a TON of 'em. Moreover, the film just bored me, stiff.    And tell me this is not an original storyline! Whoever plotted this movie probably rented a bunch of similar movies the very same night it took to write it.  I usually just sit down and try to be comfortable whenever I watch a Hollywood action movie, regardless of content, but with this, I was annoyed.   It covered up its weakness with over-the-top lacho-drum/ chase scenes, laughable dialogue and other  pretentiousness of the sort. I wonder why so many people bought into it?Was Cage ('Castor Troy') supposed to be creepy and villainlike? Everytime he kissed a woman, his character would say 'peaches.' If you want to cast a merciless terrorist  character you'd get someone like John Malkovich, or Bruce Willis, or even Michael Wincott (The main kingpin in 'The Crow') but Cage's portryal was about as endearing as a young child trying to sell lemonade. Travolta's role as the 'so-called' hero is unsympathetic and long winded, and the endless shots of his cheeks only leads me to believe he needs facial liposuction.John Woo needs to stick to making movies in Hong Kong, not that he makes bad ones, but that Hollywood affiliation seriously ruins them.",Null,0,1,26 March 1999

On the other hand, if you're a movie goer with common sense, you'll recognize this movie had 'better' flaws than script and action sequences... What if they just switched brains? That would make more sense. The science is flawed. They may have changed their facial appearance, but Travolta is bulkier and Cage is slenderer and much taller. Why did only a few people know about this 'face changing' mission? Troy wakes up out of a coma with gauze around his head, and somehow forces the doctors to put Archer's face on in its place. Wouldn't there be anestetic and sedatives involved? Olah? This was a totally stupid movie. I like some stupid action movies, that is, if they're bad enough to entertain me, but this left me wondering when the credits were going to roll, and whether there was a notation from John Woo explaining if he makes bad American action movies on purpose...

","Maybe if someone had a flashlight or an oil lamp in this movie, you could see something!

I would imagine due to all the visuals and the 'symbolic imagery' that this movie appeals more to the 'College Geek Sci-Fi fan' or a foreign audience. No offense, but films tend to be more successful in third world countries. Not only is the movie overrated, it's also completely RIDICULOUS! Alright, we have a 'floating city of Atlantis' in Outer Space which was created by aliens --- aliens that make an Ed Wood production look like Industrial Light and Magic. They're bald, wear long black coats, and top hats! How cheesy could you get? And if they were able to control the way everything worked, how did one person (Rufus Sewell) advance all of a sudden? This is the biggest flaw in the whole movie, and not the only one. If this picture had been made in the 50's, there wouldn't be as much criticism.
I would be softer on this movie if I could make out what happened. Everything around was dark, dark dark. It gives the movie a gothic feel, but with large amounts, it proves a lack of imagination.

American History X," Not worthy of the hype or critical acclaim it received.
","WARNING; There is a potential spoiler in this review. If you don't want anything given away, please do not read on. If you don't care about the movie and wonder why I'm about to point out the big flaws, please be my guest and read on.'American History X' works as the same kind of plot as 'Little Odessa.' In 'Odessa,' Tim Roth starred as a ruthless hitman who comes to terms with his estranged father. He also reunites with his kid brother(Edward Furlong), for whom he doesn't want involved in his 'line of business' . 'History X' is about a white-supremacist skinhead (played by Edward Norton) who reforms himself and doesn't want his brother (Also played by Edward Furlong) to go the same path as he did. Do the plots sound similar? Thought so. The endings for both movies are similar as well. And like both movies, the characters were not very sympathetic, and the message (if there was any) fell FLAT.For those of you who've seen it, you'll remember a line monologued by Furlong at the end saying 'there is no time for anyone to be saturated with hate and anger.' And then you'll remember what happened to him, which is a total contradiction about the line and the point. So what is that supposed to prove? It seems we've been suckered into the same sort of Melodrama before: Guy succumbs to something bad because of his father. Guy wants to redeem himself but it won't be easy because he'll have to run into a couple of tragedies along the way. How many times are we going to see that? This is a Made-for-TV plot nuance. They've done it before in 'Bad Lieutenant', then someone made 'Little Odessa,' then there was 'Affliction', and now this. What next? A movie about a drug addicted porno star who is the way he/she is because the parents were equivalent to J. W. Gracy and Lorena Bobbitt?This movie wasn't without its redeeming points. Edward Norton and Avery Brooks delivered excellent performances, which would probably give the only reason to see this. Don't see it for any other reason. Many have also missed the point that this film has a sentimental portrayal of racists, making them look 'like intelligent and loving people.' Wrong. Racism is a form of ignorance and hate, and that is what it will always be. I do not recommend 'American History X.'",Null,0,0,9 August 1999

But a well deserved Oscar for his performance. You really have to pay attention to this. Ignore the hype. Ignore any cult following it may have formed.

Back then, movies and culture was a lot different, but Hollywood and Cinema was still overrated, just as it is now. GOOD gosh!'Gone with the Wind' tells the story of a not-so-GOOD era in U.S. History between what was once known as the Union and the Confederacy. Who's the GOOD guys? Heck, the movie makes them all look GOOD! It tells the story between the romance of two GOOD people from two different sides, Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh, who, I must say, deliver GOOD performances. Hence, 'Gone with the Wind' is a GOOD movie from a not so GOOD time in the 20th century because War was going on and it wasn't nearly as hip (and GOOD. hehe) as the end of the 20th century.Look, this was a GOOD movie.

No Country for Old Men," No Country For Incompetent Rural Law Enforcement
","Faithful or not to the novel which the film is based on, the one thing the Coen Bros. recent work lacks is a solid narrative. Sure, the movie is seen from 3 characters' POV, but the central focus is supposed to be on Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) an underused and uninvolved character, and extremely awkward to the indisputably gripping premise.Yes, I understood the film. I got the 'evil triumphing over good' symbolism, the Biblical undertones and social commentary on modern society ... how someone on the street - bloodied from shotgun wounds - would only get blank stares from pedestrians, and even a half-finished bottle of beer (for comfort) would come with a price.Unfortunately this bleakness is the tip of the iceberg when you factor in cold-as-ice psychopath Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), who massacres almost everyone in his path while in pursuit of $2.4 million from a drug deal gone bad. Because the film is supposed to be 'symbolic', little is known about Anton and his connection to the money other than a shady guy in a high rise (played by Stephen Root), but even his motives are never clear. In addition, Anton's modus operandi makes it hard to believe he would associate with anyone. The violent lone wolf prevails at the end, and after the naive man who salvaged the money (Josh Brolin) is killed at a motel, Anton fulfills a perverted deal he made by visiting the man's newly widowed wife (Kelly MacDonald) and informing her of impending doom. There is no problem with villains who succeed at the end. It has been done before. Whilst not the best example, Aaron Stampler from the novel/movie 'Primal Fear'. There's a sense of disgust and dread, but at the same time awe at how someone so evil (and yet so smart and clever) could override justice. But so little is known about Anton Chigurh that he comes off as nearly what Bell calls him - a 'ghost'. He's cunning and skillful, but no indication whether he's a survivalist, ex-Navy SEAL, renegade intelligence operative, etc. Credibility is totally thrown out the door for the viewer. As for the themes: It has been done before. The vicious cycle of greed was portrayed perfectly in 'Fargo', even in movies not from the Cohen brothers; Times have been changing in the criminal world for a long time, longer than Bell admits. Bell disregards the outlaws of the Old West, he disregards serial killers and bank robbers active around his early years, and most of all the national formation of the mob ... The movie's performances are first rate, as is the sound editing and misleading appearance as a 'suspense thriller'. While not a bad film, the abruptness, clichés and lack of cinematic cohesion prevent a positive review.",5,26,49,17 November 2007
Saving Private Ryan," 'Saving Private Ryan' ranks in the TOP 20 as being one of the BEST War movies of all time and in the TOP 10 as the BEST films ever made.
","Saving Private Ryan was 100% worthy of the best picture Oscar. I can tell you that no other filmmaker could direct a more realistic depiction of warfare on Omaha beach during WWII. It was so vivid that you were almost there, witnessing (but not experiencing) the brutality, pain, and fear the soldiers went through. The first 20 minutes or so of this film is increasingly graphic, but if you've ever wondered the true nature of a story told by a surviving veteran relative, here it is!The plot is part non-fiction and part fiction, focusing on a mother who wants her son brought home after his three remaining brothers are killed in battle. A platoon of men (head by Tom Hanks, Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Jeremy Davies, Giovanni Ribisi, Garry Pepper) are sent to find the last remaining Ryan, Pvt. James Ryan (played by Matt Damon, who does not overact in the role) behind enemy lines.  Each and every soldier was different, and what made it so interesting was how they interacted with one another. Yes, they were extremely sympathetic. The cinematography was brilliant, as was the set (which they actually filmed in international areas.)  Another memorable scene was their conversations in that broken down French town towards the finale (Cherbourg?) speaking of romances that occurred back home and the irony of that record player working, with a French lady singing about heartbreak. A very UN-Hollywoodish movie.I could recommend this film to anyone, and if you can't stand to stay to see the beginning, come in when that part is over. Anyone who says this movie was 'boring' and 'pointless'  most likely has not seen the movie, or they are just fans of the Adam Sandler/Pauly Shore genre.  Ignore the negative reviews you read about this film and just see it. It will go right through you, and you will be shocked, moved, and in awe as a result.

In the film we see him get permanently separated from his family and even witness his brief brush with death as Germans flamed and bombed down buildings during the Uprising. Indeed, not the most easy film to watch (very blunt violence, including slaughter of young children) and clocking nearly 3 hours, but superb direction and attention to period detail make it a very rewarding viewing.

"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," A big letdown!
","While this isn't a bad movie, it certainly is not the GREAT movie like what everyone says.  Calling this the 'best movie ever made' is a mega hyperbole. Let me start off with the story; (no spoilers) Yun Fat and Yeoh must retrieve a stolen sword from this female fighter gone awry; the co-protagonist is a young woman who is trapped between two sides and doesn't seem to identify with anyone. (The finale, which I won't give away, shows her personal decision as a result of this identity crisis.) Mr. Lee could have been a little more complex with the story, which has been done better in countless other films. Maybe I'm not a stickler for love stories, but the interpersonal relationships here just didn't interest me. The editing wasn't very good. (For example, you see someone at one place, and then it abrubtly cuts to another location. Where are we?) The sound FX editing could have used some work (During the rooftop 'traffic scenes' you can't hear even the slightest sounds on the pavement. If this was on purpose, it wasn't realistic.) There's validity in the claim that the chop-sockey sequences were excellent. (They used wires and then digitally erased them to give the effect of some airborne martial arts moves.) But I don't think any of the sparring scenes redeem the movie as a whole. I'm not surprised that this and Gladiator (A gladiator named Maximus never actually existed!) got several Oscar Nominations, including for best picture, and I won't be surprised if either one of them wins. Just remember, the Academy chooses the winner for Best Picture of the year, just as the courts choose which politician won an election. That's just the way things go!",Null,0,0,14 February 2001
Good Will Hunting," The praise about Good Will Hunting does not make sense!
","If I had to summarize this film in a sentence, I'd say that it's an overrated, predictable `self discovery drama set on the East Cost with a bit of romance and the dialogue of a Quentin Tarantino movie.' Surprisingly enough, an affiliate of the big Q himself (Lawrence Bender) co-produced it.There's nothing to really `give away,' so I'll just say this: If this guy was a `repressed genius,' then why did he wait to show it when he got the job as a janitor? How did this person become a genius in the first place? Why didn't they just send the guy to a mathematician, so his name would  go into the history books next to Galileo and he might know the secret behind the universe? More importantly, why should we care about this person in the first place? Personally, I'd rather see a movie about a street flasher who targets the elderly. That is saying very, very little.The `self discovery'....`midlife crisis'....'I need to get my life back together' genre has been used so many times it's about as cliched as the standard Hollywood action film. That is the case with `Good Will Hunting,' a movie whose only sole purpose is to keep the halfway intelligent person alert. If you thought this movie was excellent, well, I don't know what else to say, except a recommendation to over 50 other cliched movies that also got an excellent review for no reason.Robin Williams' performance was increasingly mediocre to have won an Oscar, he did so much much better in `The Fisher King' and `Dead Poets Society.' The screenplay was just OK, and it also did not deserve an Oscar. Who picked Danny Elfman for the musical score? I thought I was listening to Yanni after his orchestra members consumed a box of laxatives. And the love interest with Minnie Driver just did not work. In fact, it ruined the movie. A little trivia for you, Damon and Driver did not get along with each other in real life during filming.Don't see it if you want something new.

At best it was very well produced for such a small budget. The camera work was excellent, the acting was decent, and the storyline was fascinating. The storyline is also the negative.Somewhat confusing. I'm clear to the part where Cohen has a rare and painful illness where he has to take medication on a regular basis. And the fact he connects this illness to the key of the Universe, Key of DNA, Key of God, Key of the Stock Market. As complex as it sounds there is no thorough explanation to this, just graphics.

I have to agree with some friend's assessments that this is a deplorable stereotype, however it's nowhere near explanatory in providing the details on why this film reeks. I thought the morality tale was poorly conceived, and it didn't look like Cruise's character changed much towards the end. (He was supposed to 'find his scruples', but I didn't see much in the fellow except that he was less constipated than before.) The romance has faux-sugar sweet, and I can't see it appealing to anyone except romance fanatics (but according to the story, that's not what the film was made for.) It would have been interesting, if, the film was instead about a coach (not an agent) who physically and mentally assaults his players to the point that he's fined, and perhaps sentenced to jail. When he leaves jail, he finds the sport he stands up for is nothing more than barbaric and starts out by denouncing the commercialism mounted behind it. That would make the film increasingly more interesting, especially due to the fact that people who don't watch sports may find this moving and fascinating. I'm sure the idea will eventually be used.

","This movie had so much potential. About the first 25 minutes of this film were classic. But what Hollywood had to do to make it `friendly' for the stupid audience ruined the whole movie.The film focuses on a Sport's Agent, the title character (played by, who else?) who discovers that the players' well being is much better than money. In a very dramatic scene at a hospital, an injured player in bed is manipulated by Cruise to play again very soon. When the player's son tells him his dad is unfit, he does not care about the kid's feelings at all. The boy curses at him, flips him off, and runs out of the scene.He then writes a short composition about his scrupulous beliefs, losing all his team members as a result. That's when the film revolves into an interesting character study to a sentimental and annoying romantic comedy (Remember the nervous breakdown scene in the office?) filled with stereotypes and syrupy dialogue. Oh gosh, a black sports' player, a white agent. What does that make you think?  More annoyance is the fact this movie was nominated for 7 Oscar nominations, including Best Picture.

The atrocities that occured during WWII were horrible, and making a joke (and profit) out of such an event is probably the most sick and twisted thing to ever appear on celluloid.

Unfortunately for the movie, it's not too original and at times non-linear. It's been said that it took elements from Hong Kong director Ringo Lam's 'City on Fire' and redefined film noir. Other way around, it was a rip-off to 'City on Fire,' and an insult to film noir. Triteness is common in the world of Hollywood. I'm glad James Woods turned away from it. Added on to the stolen plot of the 1987 movie was gratuitous uses of the 'N' word, 70s music/tends and anal sex. If this were done in one movie, it would be an unusual touch. If it's referenced in all of the director's movies, it's a lack of an imagination. And that is indeed the case if you take a look at Quentie's filmography. A movie that leaves you feeling something for the characters, even if they're low life scum, is crucial for an ending.

After the trailer, it will respectively draw people in like sheep to see it.3. Sooner or later, there's a controversy about the movie's content, and yet it is still being raved about. Sooner or later the Academy of Motion pictures will knock on the director's door based on the amount  of sheep-people who love it.

Several terrible movies were released in the summer of that year (The pretentious AFO, the loop-holed Face/Off, etc.) but you have to look at this one for what it is; Don't expect any Oscar winning performances, just sit back, relax, and have yourself a good time.The only big flaw was in the beginning when Nicolas Cage's character was convicted for this crime in the first place. (The reasonable excuse was 'self defense' but the line of him being a 'human weapon' was a propaganda trip.) Nevertheless, he takes an armed plane home after he served his time, it get's hi-jacked by the criminals aboard and he lives through the whole thing with just a couple of bruises. Call it trite, but hey, the whole thing was fun!Overall, a good roller coaster ride with a great supporting cast.",Null,0,0,12 July 1999
The Shawshank Redemption," Sentimental yet strongly moving story of injustice, optimism, retribution
","`Fried Green Tomatoes' came to mind when I first saw The Shawshank Redemption. I know they're two entirely different movies, but they had the same set-up; the narration, the way happy things happened to the supporting characters based on the effort of one/some of them. Both movies also touch on unfairness, but perhaps it's the point of view and nature of friendship which make them so similar. The whole cast was absolutely fantastic. Morgan Freeman didn't even look like he was acting; `Red' was that real. Tim Robbins, often more renowned for droll characters is top-rate as the shady yet generous Andy; Clancy Brown was detestable as the foul-mouthed murderous guard, James Whitmore a hoot as the bird man guy, and Bob Gunton, disgusting and sordid as the warden  not your regular scheming bad guy  this guy was bad with a capital `b'.  An excellent movie, and somehow excellent enough for people to put it in the Top 5 spot here. It wasn't without its flaws, but when ordered with other movies that were nominated in 1994 for best picture (and on the top 250), `Shawshank' would be the best of them.",Null,0,0,12 June 2002
The Iron Giant," Artfully crafted animated feature; appropriate for everyone.
","Circa early 1950s/1960s during the cold war, young kid finds a giant metal robot in the woods, which, despite being made by the government as a weapon of mass destruction, has a gentle personality of its own.
 The film has standard Hollywood components (evil scientist that wants to destroy the main character, Kleenex-getter moments, etc.) but the animation was wonderful, combining expertly drawn and contrasted 2D and 3D imagery. Enthusiasts of short and feature-length animated films should not miss it.",Null,0,1,20 June 2002
Trainspotting," CHOOSE right...don't choose this movie!
","This ranks up there as being one of the worst movies of all time. (Also the type that's hyped for no reason.) And don't give me any of these 'oh, it's a good depiction of the life of drug addicts and you just didn't understand it-bull.' This movie was just an all-around piece of garbage. I don't pay $3.50 to watch a plotless movie about a bunch of losers getting high, acting juvenile, and running into weird things. The characters in this film were not interesting (And they don't have to be 'decent people' to be 'interesting.') and from get go, it went nowhere! From the few local people I know who liked this, I may never know the admiration other than the true American-Hollywood fact that '...sex and violence sells.'A perfect examination of this director's films: Unsympathetic characters, no plot, and no point. Avoid this movie at all costs!!!!!",Null,1,8,1 June 1999
The Sixth Sense," It appears someone got his or her idea from someone else again (spoilers)
","It was absolutely no surprise at the end that Willis was a ghost; when he slammed the window of his wife/ex-wife's jewelry store (and she saw no one there) you could put two and two together and understand what was going on (based on what happened at the begining.)   If `Ghost' had not been released, do you think M. Night Shamaylan (sp - who cares?) would have thought of the idea to make this movie? Now, I'll give credit, although the plot is extremely imitative, the performances were first rate. There was little music. The pace was slow, that added a lot of apprehension.   It was easy to be drawn into the movie. It was entertaining. But that's it. Nothing special, nothing new. See `Stir of Echoes'  although not that original, infinitely scarier, less predictable, and better written.",Null,0,0,20 June 2002
The Matrix," Stupidity reigns in this movie, not computers.
","If you're looking forward to seeing this movie and have not seen it yet, rest assured that you're looking forward to seeing a direct to video corny B-sci-fi film with lousy actors and weak script. Some personalities may have received top billing in this, but they still delivered lousy performances.  The film is a mixture of a lot movies. (Dark City, 12 Monkeys, The Terminator, Strange Days, Johnny Mnemonic, The Lawnmower Man...just to name a few) but the cliches is not what sinks this so. It's the screenplay, which makes all the actors so constipated and robotic that it's unintentionally laughable. So much hype surrounding the movie is a shocker. I know, it's the reason why everyone loved the 'The English Patient' and 'Titanic': The imagery. There was obviously a lot of work put into the storyboard, but good visuals does not make a good movie. A lot of pretentious art house fanatics think so, and if you speak up about it (like what I'm doing) they insult you and say you just 'didn't understand it.' Sorry, I'm afraid it's the other way AROUND.  What was supposed to count as special effects? Slow motion bullets flying in the air? People freezing when they're about to do a karate kick? If that makes a movie great (despite a jello written script and cardboard performances) then the IMDb Top 250 List has new standards and the I.Q. of the Hollywood movie-going public has made a gigantic plurge like the 1929 Stock Market crash.Trite, horrid, egregious, Mumbojumbo, anemic, trivial, rubbish, ignorant, xd. Whether you saw the movie or not, that answers the question: 'What is the Matrix?'",Null,0,3,9 October 1999
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Regardless of how many people love this, here's a few critiques...
","Who doesn't know about this movie yet?I bet you could ask a person on the street and he'd know what you're talking about.Dated. The movie is dated! The special effects were superior at the time but now it's no different than your modern Hollywood mass-produced Sci-Fi epic. The dialogue stinks, and the characters are not very memorable (or someone you could relate to). If you grew up in the 70s the fondness of this movie is perfectly understandable. I went to a convention one time and the foot traffic majority consisted of either 30-40 year olds or kids under 10.This film is also uninspired. Many may not know this, but George Lucas originally got the idea from 'The Hidden Fortress,' a Japanese film written and directed by the famous Akira Kurosawa. If 'Star Wars' was never made, 'Fortress' would of been up there in noticeability with Citizen Kane and Casablanca. Essentially, this movie is just an early example of Hollywood's theft of original works of art.I'll take a cue from all the Star Wars fanatics out there and say this movie is a 'fun kitsch,' maybe something you could see every two or three years, but as a worshipped icon, give me a BREAK!!!!!",Null,1,2,23 May 1999
The Thin Red Line," Worth seeing, but not spectacular.
","Not as bad as some said; It could of been trimmed by about forty fives minutes of all the nature scenery and monologues and it had potential of being great. But...this is the movie. It was compared to 'The English Patient' by some palates, I disagree. Let's put it this way: 'The English Patient' was a boring, contrived, pretentious little Romance flick and the characters (and concept overall) were despicable and uninteresting. 'The Thin Red Line' was the opposite. While the pacing might of peeved some people, it was nothing like 'The English Patient.'  Let me reiterate, 'The English Patient' was just a bad, hyped-for-no-reason movie, this is not. If anything, this movie was underhyped. It was fascinating, and somewhat different. It wasn't an action movie (and it wasn't as great as Saving Private Ryan) but there was no yah-yah-yah Hollywoodness to the finale or even the film itself and it relied on the thoughts of these soldiers as a key premise. Who narrated each of these thoughts? That's not important. War is a scattered mess. Think of yourself as a confidante in this movie who knows how to read minds of all the characters; You hear their fears, emotions, what is worth coming back (home) to, even their destiny. It may not make sense, but they're not saying this, they're THINKING this. (A similar plot device in the powerful WWII movie, 'A Midnight Clear'). These characters might have not been people to care for, but the depiction of their feelings was realistic and the atmosphere was very well done. Now I'll admit, some of the 'insights' went over-the-top, and few nature shots went on too long. But it is worth seeing once, as long as you lower your expectations and don't expect a superficial Hollywood movie with lots of action and a big name cast.",Null,0,0,26 July 1999
Jackie Brown," Probably Tarantino's best.
","I'm not a real big fan of Quentin. Frankly, I see him as being one of the most overrated faces of Hollywood and the prince of swooping other people's ideas. That's just my opinion, but it's also many other's. Jackie Brown was workable for its decent finale. A wrap-up which is quite different from other Tarantino movies. You came away feeling satisfied with what happens to the characters. (Each one got whatever they deserved, in a good way or a bad way depending on who they were) And unlike other Tarantino movies, the characters here were richly textured, and much more believable then the foul mouthed, Lee-Marvin luvin' thugs in the ladder.
 Pam Grier makes a wonderful comeback as a Flight Attendant who is caught smuggling coke and a half a million of her boss' money. The boss is Samuel L. Jackson, who was so despisable and evil as the illegal arms dealer that anyone else in the movie was pixy dust. If she helps the bust, there's immunity on the deal. Not a perfect movie, but the performances were very good. Overall, nice adaption of Elmore Leonard's 'Rum Punch.'",Null,0,0,26 August 1999
Gladiator," Wait for video. (Spoiler alert)
","If you want an enthralling, tear-jerking epic about revenge, love and heroism, don't consider 'Gladiator'. Although the film had its riveting points, which included the battle scenes, there were the same number of negative points.Let's start with accuracy. I'm sure you may not be as much of a historical nut as I am, but there were a number of anchorisms in this film. For example:1. The real-life Commodus (portrayed by Phoenix) always wore a lion's skin, beard/mustache, was obsessed with Hercules and it was never certain whether he was responsible for murdering Marcus Aurelius or Lucius Verus. Although he was a suspicious factor with their demise.2. Commodus was very paranoid, and banished his wife Lucilla to an Island (presently Malta) where she was later hunted down and killed. In the film, she appears from the begining to end. Odd?3. On the throne, the letters IMP CAES AVF appear. In reality, it would be IMP CAES AVG, which meant Imperator Caesar Augustus. (Just a Roman Royalty 'rank' if you don't know what I'm talking about.)There are plenty more to name, but that would be irrelevant, because this film was meant for the Hollywood moviegoing public, not a nitpicking perfectionist like me.The acting was quite poor. It doesn't take any brains to figure that out, or the fact that Roman's spoke Roman (Vintage Latin) and not English. Despite Richard Harris' brief role he didn't put forth his best effort, or show emotion in his character. Russell Crowe struggled with wooden acting, at first, but after a while his character picked up.This movie wasn't boring. I can assure you of that. But it did have its problems, and some may discrimate like I did. Whatever view point you expect, wait for the video rental release.",Null,0,1,14 May 2000
The Wedding Singer," Not bad...that is, if Adam Sandler wasn't in it.
","The idea overall was cute, heartfelt, if just a little predictable and by-the-numbers: A wedding singer is abandoned by his fiance/he meets and falls in love with a bussgirl at one of the parties/unfortunately, the bussgirl is about to marry someone else and so on... You'll have no problem guessing the ending, but if the content on a whole was done the right way and made watchable (and at least somewhat interesting) there's no problem. Even a grouchy critic like me would give this type of genre a chance, regardless of how sickly sweet it is. But there's a problem here:Adam Sandler's presence. Yes, he's the star of the movie, but he simply takes what little there is and flushes it all down the toilet. He's just not funny. Imagine a version of Pauly Shore just a little bit more manlike and mature, and you got em'. In a nutshell. His fake childish way of talking: Not funny. His vocal expressions (period): Not funny. His vandalism of inanimate objects:(When he screamed and broke that window at the wedding. Have you guessed it yet?) Not funny. If you're a fan of simple Adam and just itching to see this movie, look's like my advice is just going to fall on deaf ears. If this is your first Sandler outing, be forwarned: 'Crude', 'tasteless', and 'tiresome' summarizes all of his personas.",Null,0,1,25 June 1999
High Fidelity," Nonexistent plot in a (somewhat) enjoyable movie.
","'High Fidelity' didn't have much of a plot. It's the type of film where nothing can be given away, you could leave and comeback twenty minutes later and you won't miss anything. Or, it can be watched while cooking, painting, etc. From beg-end, the film focuses on this record store owner who struggles with his present relationship and looks back at some past ones that go as far back as middle school.  If you know some of bands on the soundtrack you might understand the in-jokes, but there was nothing laugh-out loud funny.  Cusack's deadpan expressions and the farce-like sequences in the record store (with the customers) kept it somewhat watchable, but when you rent this, don't expect anything complicated.",Null,0,1,25 December 2000
The Godfather," MAJOR difference in opinion...
","I finally got a chance to see this movie. I tried to watch it with an open mind, without letting the hype dilute an even slight bit of impartiality - and I just can't say it's a very good movie. Perchance if soap opera was its own category, this may stand true to its title as '#1' on the IMDb.   It perplexes me how people can call this landmark moviemaking when they probably have not seen works from other directors - Kurosawa, Truffaut, Lang... - all of whom had a much better eye than Coppolla. Most of these greats are now forgotten, with the exceptions of occasional screenings at film schools where one discovers that the Contemporary filmmaking style overseas  (1950s and 1960s)  was duplicated by American directors in the 1970s.  So what was wrong with this movie? Nonexistent or loose plot: No suspense, climax, excitement, or outcome. I thought the acting/characters were forgettable. Any other actor could have pulled off what Brando did and the fact they went through all that trouble to make him 10 or 20 year older just proves they shot for name recognition.  There were only a few things that I remember in this 3 hours of triviality: the 'offer you can't refuse' line, Don Vito collapsing in a garden while a child obliviously plays, Caan's Santino character getting holed up, and bullets consistently going into foreheads. Maybe the artful yet repellent depiction of gratuitous violence is what made this such a masterpiece. But style without substance does not a good movie make. For those who say 'oh, you just didn't get it, see it again', please get your mind out of the gutter - stop basing your opinions on what you're conditioned to like. The Emperor's New Clothes, big time. End of review.",1,69,188,16 February 2002
