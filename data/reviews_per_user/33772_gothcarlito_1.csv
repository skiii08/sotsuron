Black Swan," A Beautiful Nightmare that will Haunt you for Awhile.
","Usually I don't do movie reviews, but I feel like Black Swan deserves one. The movie starts off with a ballerina named Nina who auditions for the part of the Swan Queen for their upcoming show, Swan Lake. The movie starts off slowly with a little cut on her toes and fingers, and as the movie progresses, the pressure that Nina is going through in the movie increases for her and the viewer. The movie gradually becomes more and more intense, the pain and pressure that Nina experience increases, the psycho-sexual scenes become more and more intense, bizarre and at one point frightening. Natalie Portman delivers an outstanding performance that will most certainly get her an Oscar nomination and and a very high possibility of a win. Vincent Cassel, Mila Kunis, Barbara Hershey and Wiona Ryder all give electrifying performances. The cinematography is excellent, the costumes are beautifully designed, the editing is superb and the score is absolutely beautiful. You will feel the pain and pressure that Nina goes through and in the end, deep inside you just want to cry of pity. The movie can be hard to watch at some points, but it's very hard to take your eyes off the movie. You will have this movie in mind for awhile and despite the graphic material of the movie, the story behind it will keep you thinking and it may also, possibly, give you nightmares. If you saw Requiem for a Dream then should have an idea of how disturbing it can get, and the cinematography of the film. Kudos to Darren and his cast and crew. This movie is by far one of the best films of the year and decade, better be seeing this film in the Oscar race.",10,5,11,18 December 2010
