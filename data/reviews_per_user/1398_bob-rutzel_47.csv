Walk the Line," Outstanding
","This is the life of Johnny Cash based upon two books that he wrote.The things that makes this movie good are the music itself and the times June Carter (Witherspoon) and Cash (Phoenix) are together whether singing or just talking. They have great chemistry, but the singing part has the edge as far as I am concerned. The music might even over-ride all else, but when you consider who the singers were (in real life), this becomes really great. What a time it must have been for a young Johnny Cash to be on a circuit with June Carter, Elvis Presley, Waylon Jennings, Roy Orbison, Carl Perkins, and Jerry Lee Lewis. Of course I am sure each didn't know how great each was to become, but it must have been good times nevertheless.Phoenix's singing was good and at times you almost heard (at the end of the movie) Johnny Cash, but the mannerisms were down pat and you know we looked for that. You just know.Now for the title. I would have put the title as Ring of Fire, or Hello, I'm Johnny Cash. Come on he didn't walk the line when he was still married to Vivian, his first wife. It was just wishful thinking on his part. Okay, the line was given to him by June. Still.I still cannot help thinking that besides the music the person that puts this over the top is Reese Witherspoon. Without her, this still would have been good, but with her singing and portrayal of June Carter, this became great in my eyes. I had the best feeling when she was on screen with Phoenix, especially when she was singing. She may have been the friend, the girl friend as a secondary focus to Johnny Cash, but she made this movie. She was much more than an excellent Supporting Actress. She was the Best Actress and she has my vote.",10,1,2,2 March 2006
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Good PR, Not Funny
","Borat (Cohen) a TV reporter, leaves his home in Kazakstan and goes to the United States to learn the culture there and report back. Along the way he sees a picture of Baywatch's Pamela Anderson and decides he is going to marry her.The PR on this film is truly outstanding and the DVD is flying off the shelves. However, once you see it, you cannot figure out what the celebration was all about in the first place. This is not a funny film. Many sketches can be considered offensive, but the way this was done, I can't see anyone taking offense because anyone watching could tell it was a comedy bit and not to be taken seriously. The words 'comedy bit' is used loosely here. I mean Cohen's big toothy grin is always looking at you, the audience, during the sketch, to get your reaction to what he thinks is hilarious. Many of the sketches were clever and some were mildly funny for me, but on the whole, not that funny, no belly-laughs as many claim. Admittedly, there were a few funny lines, or questions rather, and they cannot be repeated here as rough language was used to shock. As mentioned some of the sketches were mildly funny, but if you really took a serious look at them you could see where they rushed the sketch and had they taken more time, then the sketch would have been funny. But, this was all too spontaneous, too fast, and when a sketch is rushed, the results are going to be mixed as you can tell by my reactions.The best part of this movie, for me, was when Borat was learning dining etiquette, and I must admit, this was a fairly funny bit. If only the rest of the movie was along these lines, but they departed from this. I like subtle humor and if this was done more along those lines, then yes, it could have been funnier that what I witnessed. But, this was too much in-your-face comedy (term used loosely), and hence not funny for me. And, I do like physical comedy when it is funny however, there is a point when physical comedy is just physical motion, and this movie achieves that.

Mission: Impossible III," It's Okay
","Ethan Hunt (Cruise) must provide the Rabbit's Foot (don't ask) to Davian (Hoffman) who has kidnapped Hunt's wife and will kill her if he doesn't get it. I like action movies, but when the action is almost non-stop from beginning to end I end up in La La Land. It just gets tedious, but that is what MI III is all about: action; and I really shouldn't complain. I did have a choice.However, everything is good, the acting, the dialogue, the stunts, the cinematography, and, of course, there is a twist and you are left to figure out who the mole is. There is just simply too much action, and yes, it works but let's hope this is the last of the MI movies. Enough already. What might have helped more is an injection of some humor. Guess the Bond movies spoiled us.Now, I couldn't help noticing that some very bad camera angles had Tom Cruise looking like either Tim Daly or Mark Wahlberg. Remember, I did say I went to La La Land at times. I had to look really hard at times to make sure it was Tom Cruise and still wasn't sure. Hoffman loses the Capote voice and is quite good as a bad guy and may take some roles destined, perhaps, for Gary Busey or Willem Defoe. And, yes I did notice that Cruises' on-screen wife (Monaghan) did bear some resemblance to Katy Holmes and you do know who she is, right?",6,0,1,10 November 2006
Lucky Number Slevin," Excellent Thriller
","Because of mistaken identity Slevin (Hartnett) gets caught in the middle of a war between 2-crimelord rivals (Freeman and Kingsley). This can't be good.This is one you have to stay with and watch everything because the things you may miss will show up later on and you will be lost. This is a little short on action, but the story itself and the acting make up for that. This throws everything at you and you think you know what is going on because everything makes sense. You might say this is a larger variation of the Kansas City Shuffle as Goodkat (Willis) likes to point out. Have I said too much? I don't think so. This will rank as a classic along with Pulp Fiction, and Sin City and yes, The Usual Suspects. The cinematography isn't as good as in the movies just mentioned but it is good nevertheless.The acting and dialogue all around is excellent. You will enjoy the New Jersey almost Brooklynese accent coming out of Ben Kingsley (The Rabbi). You are amazed because you still remember Kingsley as Gandhi and how could this be? As for Josh Hartnett, I still say he looks like a young Tommy Lee Jones and acts like him too. Good job. I have new respect for Lucy Liu. She really is good, and I fell in love. As for Willis and Freeman (The Boss) what more can be said about them? They are perfect.This is an excellent cast along with a very good supporting cast giving us an excellent thriller.",10,6,8,1 October 2006
The Longest Yard," Bad Remake
","A former NFL Quarterback (Sandler) breaks his parole and gets sent back to prison where the warden (Cromwell) sets up a nationally televised football game between the guards and the convicts to promote his run for the governor of the state.Remakes are okay if you are doing Spiderman, but not something like this. The original was so much better that I would recommend people go rent it. It's very good. Blockbuster is open late. That show had its comedic moments, but it also had good tension between Reynolds (NFL QB) and Eddie Albert (Warden). There was good acting, drama, suspense and relief in the resolution at the end. That was a drama that had good comedic moments. This is a 'comedy' that has nothing.This remake is a mess. Adam Sandler is miscast (but he is one of the producers so..), Chris Rock is annoying and the wisecracks, prison transvestites and football stunts are old hat, not funny and actually quite boring. I didn't find one line worthy of a laugh or even a smile. No drama, no suspense and I didn't care about anyone. Burt Reynolds, James Cromwell and all the supporting cast are very good, but with the 'star' being miscast there isn't much hope for the rest of this.Now, why is Sandler miscast? I didn't believe he could ever have been an NFL QB. And, let's face it, he plays the same deadpan victim part in all his movies.There is something that I don't understand in regards to the story itself. If the Warden (Cromwell) wanted to use the game as a national showcase for his political ambitions, why was winning the game at any cost, repeat: at any cost, more important? Oh, I understand--just didn't like it.I do not think the original had this story-line (TV national coverage) in there.There has to be a brake in some Hollywood warehouse that can put a stop to all the bad remakes that are thrown at us (leave Spiderman alone). Anyone know where that warehouse is? Go long!",5,3,6,17 October 2005
Deja Vu," Solid All Around
","ATF Agent Doug Carlin (Washington) gets called in by a secret government agency to help out in the bombing of a ferry boat with 500+ passengers aboard in New Orleans.There is something to be said about a Denzel Washington movie: it never disappoints.When you watch a movie you want the beginning of it to really capture your attention and this one does that. Fantastic scenes is all I can say. Kind of unbelievable too. The secret gov't agency Task Force Leader, Pryzwarra, (Kilmer) has some new toys to help catch criminals and it involves time-shifting technology that allows looking 4-days into the past into any area via the use of triangulations of digital satellite imagery. That's as far as I am going to go with that technology as it does become complicated, but extremely interesting to watch. This is a thriller of the highest order, and there is no way you will figure out the twist at the end.Performances all around are outstanding. And, yes, Paula Patton does indeed resemble Halle Berry, who is now the standard for beautiful black actresses. The cinematography is also outstanding, and the dialogue is believable. You know, I have this feeling that I wrote this review beforeHmmmm.. You know, I have this feeling that I wrote this review beforeHmmmm..Violence: Yes, Sex, No, Nudity: Partial, but in a darkened scene. Can't see much. Language: No",9,3,6,25 April 2007
Finding Neverland," Good Family Movie
","I said this was a good family movie, that is, if you don't look into other things: Barrie's relationship with his wife (they slept in separate bedrooms), his seemingly platonic relationship with the mother (neither one advances any interest in the other), and his compulsion to play with children (but that could have been research for Peter Pan). If you don't look at those things this is a good family movie. In other words, just watch and enjoy the movie, don't ask questions. May not be anything there anyway.The pace is even and moves along nicely. I love the Scottish accent and Depp brings it off perfectly. We can only assume that Barrie was a more than even-tempered gentleman.I would have liked to see Barrie be more consumed, okay animated, with this idea of a Peter Pan. Depp plays Barrie too laid back I thought, but if Barrie was a laid back kind of guy what choice does Depp have? No where in this film does Barrie get even mildly animated, except when he is playing with the kids, of course, and there it's okay. And, even there it is mild. So Depp's performance must be considered outstanding. In fact, Depp is outstanding in everything he plays in. Why hasn't he won an Oscar? The whole production is excellent. Dustin Hoffman plays the part as Barrie's financial backer. Julie Christie plays Winslet's mother. She could have played her sister. I would like to know what Julie Christie eats. She looks more than great. Maybe I should go see Dr. Zhivago again. Do you realize how long ago that was? What does she eat? She looks really, really good.",8,0,0,27 March 2005
Two for the Money," Watchable
","Walter Abraham (Pacino) hires Brandon Lane (McConaughey) who has a talent for picking winners in Pro Football.We get to see a little bit of pro sports gambling in picking teams to win in pro football, and we get to see some of the emotions that go along with it. Walter has the most successful sports advising company in the nation, and becomes a father figure to Brandon and hangs his star on him because Brandon has the gift. Walter, Brandon and Tony (Ruso) all had terrible childhoods and now must stick together to make this work.I know Pacino is a good actor, but it seems to me that he likes to hear himself talk a little too much. In this movie, he never quits being 'up.' We needed a break from this from time to time, and it rarely came. He plays the part a little too flip for my money. Oh, yes, we still get his obligatory harrang when he visits a Gamblers Anonymous meeting and harasses the participants. That is his schtick and we must be prepared for it somewhere in the movie. Still, he is a good actor, but I think he needs to tone it down a notch. You see, he not only yelled in Brandon's ears, he yelled in ours too.There is a lot of language in here and the movie applauds it, encourages it, and displays it at every turn. That is annoying in the beginning, but after you hear it so often it seems to go away and you don't hear it so much, but it's still there, but not as annoying. Does this make sense? The rest of the cast is fine, and the story does move along pretty good, but does have its slow moments. We get the idea that a lot of people depend on the 'pics' from a company like Walter has. Walter's company has a policy of pushing the client to the limit to get him to wager more money with their bookie (Walter's company get a percentage of what is wagered). When things are good, they are very good, but when things go bad people get hurt. Maybe this is the warning of this movie: don't depend too much on other people's advice, learn to depend more on yourself.",6,5,9,27 January 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Woof, woof, Matey
","Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp) owes a debt to Davie Jones (Nighy) and if he fails he will forever work for Davie Jones in the afterlife. The British are after Davie Jones' chest. What could be in it that they want? The British know it's not treasure.This is a long, and tedious movie which didn't need to have been made. A shorter version could have sufficed providing the dialogues could be understood for the most part (there is a lot of mumbling in here), the chase scenes (there are too many chase scenes that go on forever) could either be cut down or shortened considerably, and something else bothered me too. Why were we subjected to almost a half hour plus of some natives trying to capture Sparrow to cook him alive to release his godly spirit? Why, woof, woof, why? I have to admit all the CGI are terrific. Yes, some of the stunts are very good, some are pretty bad and some are neither good or bad as they are just there for no apparent reason But, this is what hurts most: no good lines were heard. The writing was very bland, woof, woof.The acting was okay for the story such as it is. No Oscar nominees in here. The only one I wanted to see more of was Elizabeth Swann (Knightley) as she was the only human looking thing in the movie. Pretty too. Get a load of Davie Jones (Nighy). He looked like Buffalo Bill with his octopus face. As for Johnny Depp (he is a good actor) he needed more lines in this to keep my interest. It's okay to watch him act like a drunken sailor, but he needed more lines to help us understand some things. Half the movie he is on the run from something. Enough already, woof, woof.And, they want to make a third installment? This is not an epic, this is a long drawn out contrived story. Oh, that's right Keith Richards needs to show up. So the only people who would have an interest in the third installment would be Keith Richards and the Rolling Stones fans. Count me out. But, you see there has to be a third installment because some people need to know what happened to Captain Jack Sparrow. I do not need to know, matey, woof, woof.Too long, too many chase scenes, too much mumbling, too many dark scenes and no good lines are all this dog has to offer. Woof, woof, Matey, woof, woof.",2,2,4,10 December 2006
Alexander," Tedious
","This is the story of Alexander the Great (Farrell) and his drive to conquer the known world. Triumph after triumph only fueled Alexander for more, but his army was getting weary of this and wanted to return home. I kept rooting for them. I was getting weary too.The acting is good, but too many main characters (Hopkins as Ptolemy, our narrator; Kilmer as Philip, Alexander's' father) spoke for too long too many times and this helped some boredom to set in to a point I lost interest in what they were saying. And, I became weary of listening to Alexander going on and on, too often, to justify another campaign. These long soliloquies really serve no purpose but to annoy. Maybe that is why the army bent to Alexander's wishes to push on. It was easier than having to listen to another venting.The battle scenes were excellent, despite the nervous cameras making me dizzy, but they went on too long as well. If it weren't for the FF button on the DVD Player, the battle scenes would still be playing.The movie was in a nutshell, way too long, and tedious. And, it's not always okay to try and make our heroes (Alexander) more human to us. But, couple that with long winded utterances, and never ending battles the more-human Alexander is not all that appealing. Do we really need to see all these human frailties? What purpose is served? To show that he wasn't so great? Huh?Angelina Jolie played a good part as the Queen and mother who wanted Alexander to find a way to kill off Philip and become king. Of course, Alexander is resistant to this as he loved both parents. But, the movie absolves Alexander for any part he played in his father's murder. Was this the truth? Hmmmmm.",5,0,0,9 August 2005
Constantine," It was okay
","Constantine (Reeves) committed suicide (Catholics go direct to Hell when this happens) when he was a boy and was brought back in a deal with Heaven to send demons who have crossed the line (to our world) back to Hell. By doing this he is trying to work his way back on the path to Heaven. Why he was brought back is not known but he has the ear of both Heaven (Gabriel) and Hell. Now, too many demons are crossing over and Constantine believes the Devil is up to something not agreed to with God.The title of this could have been The Spear of Destiny as some believe that Christ died when he was speared by the Roman soldier. Whoever holds this spear controls the world. The spear was lost, of course, and found for this movie. It's impact was short lived and it's easier to name a sequel Constantine 2, rather than the Spear of Destiny 2. You may remember Constantine, but not the short lived spear that really didn't have the impact I thought this story would give it. This story was too much concerned with sending demons back to Hell. I think the sequel will have more to do with the Spear of Destiny. I can't wait. Can you? If the sound on my DVD version was any better I might have enjoyed this more. Sometimes it was very difficult to make out what a character said. You would think that a little rewind to go over the audio again and again would have helped, but it didn't' the countless times I rewound. Those who watched this in a movie theater really must have gone crazy with 'what did he say?' But, I got the idea and that is enough, I suppose. Maybe I just had a bad DVD. Maybe.However, everything was good, the acting was good, the cinematography was outstanding and a few demons startled me when I least expected it. Those I heard clearly wouldn't you know. The story got more complicated when Lucifer arrives on the scene near the end, almost like it was another story entirely and I got lost for a moment (sound, remember?) or two, but I got the idea, I think, maybe. Now, if I told you why he appeared that would not be any fun.But, all in all, not bad. Not scary, and the suspense was not really there for a suspense movie. Is it just me or is Keanu Reeves getting better? He did a really good job. But, no 'whoa.' I missed that.",7,3,5,24 July 2005
Match Point," Feeling Lucky?
","Chris Wilson (Rhys-Meyers) a tennis pro works his way into British upper class society, marries the rich girl and gets a cushy job with her father's London business and has the world by the tail. Then Nola (Johansson) becomes available and Chris wants her. Some luck, eh? This was directed by Woody Allen and if there are laughs in here, they must be a British thing because I didn't see them. No one did. Not even the British. But, that's okay, this is a good, although too long, movie. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers still looks an awful lot like a young Elvis Presley and Scarlett Johansson looks like, well.. heaven.. where all prayers have been answered. The movie is worth seeing just to gaze upon her beauty.Match Point in tennis means that whatever side has the advantage and wins this point, wins the match. Woody Allen opens the movie with the match point ball hitting the net cord and if the Ad side hit that ball and it goes over, the match is won. If it doesn't go over, then the game continues until one side has the opportunity to get to another match point. Some will say luck plays a very important part in this game and maybe in life itself. The tennis ball hitting the net cord that opens the movie comes full circle later on and is extremely cleverly done.Okay, so it's not a comedy, but a drama and later on a thriller..sort of. That's not so bad. Just when you think everything will be revealed and the characters start running for cover, Chris does something quite unexpected and this is where I sat up and took notice. I was shocked at what he was going to do. I couldn't believe it and hoped I was wrong. And, this was the only part of the movie where I began to care for the characters. Before that I didn't care. OK, I lied, I cared for Nola from the minute I first saw her. Come on, she's Scarlett Johansson!Now, which way did the ball bounce? Over the net or did it stay on this side? Let me sum it up this way, be careful what you wish for and hope that you get lucky when you do get it. I suppose the real question here is was Chris on the Advantage side or the other side when the ball was deciding where to go?",8,0,1,30 April 2006
The Prestige," Okay-Good
","Two Magicians Angier (Jackman) and Borden (Bale) who were once friends now are intent on destroying the other by learning each others' magic secrets. Sounds like this will be very good, doesn't it?'There are 3-parts to a magic act' as Cuttter (Caine) tells us in the beginning and at the end of the movie, the Pledge, the Turn, and the Prestige. Who knew? You want me to tell you what each one is, don't you? Not going to happen. I just like the parts where now you see it, now you don't; or where you see nothing and then you see something. Anyway, now you know there will be twists and turns and that is what you expect to see, and you are not disappointed. The beginning of this movie is somewhat confusing, but it all works out and yet, there are still some parts I am not up on. I might have to see this again. They go into flashbacks and somehow you have to keep telling yourself it is a flashback you think. See? Troubles there too. And, the problem with the flashbacks have to do with a murder that you didn't see happen and that was confusing until the last 10-minutes. It was confusing because I kept asking myself for most of the movie, how was the murder committed? Why is this person in jail? See? Was I misdirected by the Director who knows misdirection is the key to magic? Hmmmm.The audio (or was it the English accents) was a problem for some of the dialogue that I couldn't get, but otherwise the cinematography, the dialogue in general, and the acting performances were okay. However, I keep thinking that Christian Bale was not right for the role he played. I don't think he brought his 'A' game. Is there another Batman film in his future? Wasn't truly aware that David Bowie (he played Tesla) was in this. He is outstanding. And, when he spoke I said 'that sounds like Pierce Brosnan, imitating a slow-talking Chinaman speaking very good English.' It was great. I loved it. Michael Caine is always good and he is the only Englishman I can understand easily. As for Scarlett Johansson, I wasn't aware she was in this movie also (I don't look at the box). She is, as always, excellent, but needs a movie with more lines. We don't see enough of her. Again, some humor might have helped this production, as things were played much too seriously, and, there were too many scenes that were too dark to really see what was going on. And, you will never guess the outcome in the last 10-minutes. And, after you see the outcome, you may want to see the movie again to be sure you understood what you thought you understood. Save me a seat as I need to catch up on some things too. But, despite some shortcomings, this is a good movie, not as good as The Illusionist, but okay-good.

Crash," Not a Must See
","This is a story (term used loosely) about people having a bad day (or life) and all of them have someone to blame it on (except themselves). Don Cheadle's character, Detective Graham, says in the beginning of the movie, that we have all lost touch with one another and find a way to 'crash' into each other to reconnect. When we are not 'crashing' we are hiding from others and from ourselves.It's how we 'reconnect' that is disturbing. We use the negatives: hate, prejudice, anger, fear, violence.......well, you get the idea.The cinematography, dialogue, and acting are all good, but nothing outstanding. OK, I would say Cheadle is really coming on as a major actor, but it's the content that is the focus here. One can see these dark-sided things almost everyday in the police and lawyer shows on TV and besides the newspapers are full of this stuff as well.We get to see dark slices of life of various characters. Yes, the characters do save themselves, but this is not to say this will always happen in real life. However I am not sure the Rookie cop saves himself.So even though the production is good I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. It is not a 'must see.'",7,1,5,12 September 2005
The Polar Express," Thoroughly Enjoyable
","A young boy who doubts the existence of Santa Claus hears a noise outside his window on Christmas Eve and rides the Polar Express to the North Pole.I waited for this movie just as I waited for Santa Claus when I was younger: full of anticipation. It did not disappoint. There is a new genre out there making humans look like cartoon characters, or making cartoon characters look like humans and I cannot figure out which is which, or the name for this new genre, but it works. Thoroughly enjoyable.The photography or cinematography was nothing short of spectacular. I will admit sometimes it looked like Kaleidoscope magic, but it worked. There were only two things that I would have changed to make it better (of course). One: there was too much hesitancy when a child character would speak sometimes. I felt like the character was waiting for someone to give him/her the lines to speak. And, second, I would have given this more music. Oh, there was music and for a minute I thought this might be a musical and maybe in some ways it was, sort of, but there needed to be more of it and more upfront with it. You know, really ring it in. You betcha! In the second half the music was muted in the background. I heard Bing Crosby and others, but I kept waiting to hear Dean Martin too, but never did hear him.Now, this has the feel of a nice family movie, but I would be careful letting really young children see it because there are some scary scenes when the Polar Express goes off the tracks and LOOK OUT! Get it? Now, if the child is used to playing intense sock'em video games then okay. They won't be too shocked with this. Otherwise",8,2,3,26 November 2005
Capote," Compelling
","Two men kill a family of four on a Kansas night and this compels Truman Capote to write a novel about it.I used to see Truman Capote on the talk shows in those years I stayed up late. It was difficult, at times, to understand him then and watching the DVD now it was still difficult to understand him or the character playing him. But, armed with the power of a Remote I can rewind many times and sometimes I was able to understand what he said. At other times, I said 'forget it ' when I still couldn't get a handle on what was said. Is this a tribute to Hoffman who played him? Probably. The one thing I do remember from those late night talk shows is that, at times, he was funny. Well, when I could understand what he said, that is. No, I am not being critical here. This is the way it was.Capote is obsessed with only three things: 1) why did the two men kill a family of four in Kansas that night. 2) when he would get the ending for his novel: 3) with himself, of course.His researcher is cousin or childhood friend (I have heard both) Nell Harper Lee who wrote To Kill a Mockingbird. In this movie she does finish her book and the movie is made and Capote has no joy for her as this is the time he desperately needs an ending to his book and he cannot get it and can think of nothing else. From what I remember of those talk shows when Capote was on, Mr. Hoffman nails the character perfectly. See, watching TV does educate.Only two men deserved the Best Actor Award, David Strathairn (for Edward R. Murrow) and Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Both nailed their character, but Hoffman walked away with the Oscar.Good acting performances all around, but the story is in the details and in the telling. Very compelling.",8,0,0,26 March 2006
Little Miss Sunshine," Watchable.....barely
","The Hoover family takes a trip to California so daughter Olive (Breslin) can compete in the Little Miss Sunshine Pageant.This movie takes too long a time to get to what this is all about. That is besides telling the story of a dysfunctional family. More on that later. Where it eventually goes is to the Little Miss Sunshine Pageant in California where young daughter Olive (Breslin) will compete. Seems grandpa (Arkin) has taught Olive some new moves and no one has seen them until she is finally on stage. Without knowing what she is doing she satirizes the whole concept of child beauty pageants and tells the world what the competition is really all about. Yes, that does sound interesting, doesn't it? Remember, I said it takes too long to get here.The family: Father, Richard (Kinnear), is a failed motivational speaker who is trying to publish his 9-steps to success; Son, Dwayne (Dano), hasn't spoken to anyone in over a year and won't until he gets accepted to the USAF Academy to become a pilot; Grandpa (Arkin) is a dirty old man who lets loose with F-bombs at the drop of a hat; Wife, Sheryl (Collette), is sort of okay but is too supportive of the rest of the family when she shouldn't be; Frank (Carrell) Sheryl's brother is gay, and failed a suicide attempt and has just been released from the hospital. Olive (Breslin) is the only normal and innocent one in all this. You learn all this very early in the movie.Although billed as a comedy, it is lite-drama and there are some almost good lines in here, but to give any would give too much away and there weren't many anyway. You are not missing anything. The physical comedy is old, tired and no longer works. One would think that a dysfunctional family would garner some comedy, but not here, well, save for some okay good lines just mentioned, but cannot be divulged. And, again, you are still not missing anything. The lines were good, not great. Read my lips: you are not missing anything.The acting is fine. It's the script until the competition and even there it still needed work.The ending is what bothered me the most. By my account there wasn't one. If you watch this, you will see. And, no this doesn't open the door to a sequel. At least I hope not. They wouldn't, would they? Oh, God!",5,2,11,24 December 2006
Jarhead," Surprisingly Good
","This is based upon a true story by Anthony Swofford of Marines getting ready to fight in the first Gulf War and Jake Gyllenhaal plays Swofford in the movie. You can be sure that many things in this movie did happen and you can be surprised/shocked or not.I said this is surprisingly good because I am a little tired of war movies as they all seem to be the same. Not this one.The acting is good all around. The cinematography is also very good and some scenes of the oil fires (remember them?) almost make you feel like the oil is raining down on you too. Those scenes are that good. But, this movie first deals with the time before the war actually starts for these Jarheads as they wait in the desert for the signal to go. Now, you can see how the time was spent and as mentioned already these things did happen and you can judge the results for yourself. Some questions you might ask yourself: is war good, bad, the same as other wars or different? Now understand that this unit of soldiers are all Snipers and there is one thing I didn't understand. When one mission was to take out two enemy officers in the same place, only one team was sent, the Shooter and the Spotter. Why weren't two teams sent? I mean you shoot one enemy officer and the other one has an opportunity to get away. That was the only thing I found wrong here. But, I wasn't there so There is an awful lot of language, and a lot of very crude sex talk in here so be prepared for that. But, I would venture to say that the events rang true.And, you will also learn why Marines are called Jarheads. Hoo Ray!",7,1,2,10 March 2006
Batman Begins," Terrific
","After the death of his parents Bruce Wayne (Bale) decides to rid Gotham City of criminal activity and decides to do this as Batman.This starts out a little slow, too slow perhaps as we see Bruce Wayne as a child witnessing his parents' murder; then he is an adult climbing a mountain to be trained by some Ninja society that is bent on world domination. Okay, that's enough story. Things get good when Bruce Wayne decides to turn himself into Batman. That is what we were waiting for all the time and this movie doesn't disappoint. It rocks. The cinematography and special effects are outstanding.Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Katie Holmes, Gary Oldman, Rutger Hauer and all the rest of the cast are all very, very good. Liam Neeson is perfect, as always, but I wish he would use the Rob Roy voice more often. What a great voice when he uses it. Maybe I should go see Rob Roy again.Bales' Batman is perfect and this is not a knock on the previous Batman actors who all did a terrific job. There is one thing I noticed: when Bale has the Batman hood (mask, cowl) on, it compresses his face so much I hardly recognized the Bale character to a degree I almost thought someone else did the Batman close-ups. Maybe that was intentional. Anyway, it worked. His secret identity would have been unknown to me had I been there.I did enjoy all the previous Batman movies, and I was very glad to see the emphasis was on Batman this time, and not the master criminal (Penguin, Joker, Mr Freeze etc). The previous Batman movies paid too much attention and screen time to the one performing as the bad guy (DeVito, Nicholson etc) This movie stayed with Bruce Wayne and Batman as well it should, and I hope sequels do the same. Got it, guys? There will be a sequel to this and the Joker is first out of the box as Lt. Gordon (Oldman) shows Batman a playing card of guess who.All in all, this is a terrific movie and probably more faithful to the original story by Bob Kane.Let's see, we have Spiderman, The Punisher, The Transporter, The Dare Devil, Cat Woman and now a good Batman. Can another Superman be far behind? Hmmmmm.",9,1,2,20 October 2005
Ghost Rider," No Boo Here
","Johnny Blaze (Cage) sells his soul to the devil (Fonda) to help his father and his girl friend (Mendez)The Ghost Rider is based upon a Marvel Comic character. I never read that one.This production was very good as far as the CGI went and some auto stunts as well. Nicolas Cage is one of the actors I really enjoy watching, the others being Jack Palance, Patrick McGoohan, and sometimes Jack Nicholson. But, on the whole, there was a big letdown for me.The movie started too slow with too much time spent on Johnny Blaze's youth before he became the Ghost Rider. The dialogue here suffered too between Johnny and his father (Bret Cullen) and Johnny and Roxanne (Mendez) and Johhny and the Devil (Fonda). Hope they didn't use the dialogue from the comics. In comics the dialogue works, but to actually say the lines in a movie..well, they don't always translate well. OK, forget the Batman comic, TV dialogue.There was too much watching Ghost Rider with head, arms, legs and bike all aflame. That was okay, but I came to see Nicolas Cage one of the actors I really enjoy watching. When Cage did appear without flames he didn't disappoint. He is always good. The rest of the cast were fine, stilted dialogue and all. Can't blame them, but the director should have upgraded conversations to present-day give and take. The best dialogue was between adult Johnny Blaze (Cage) and Sam Elliott, the caretaker (of the cemetery). Someone forgot to tell Peter Fonda that this wasn't a play and a little too much soliloquy crept into his lines, but I am being picky here. He was fine. Not often that we see him.The cops treated the Ghost Rider as Public Enemy Number One and we really didn't see an acknowledgement that the cops realized Ghost Rider was one of the good guys. Maybe Ghost Rider II, eh? And, I do hope Nicolas Cage plays the part again because, as noted, he is one of the actors I really enjoy watching.

The Illusionist," Excellent
","Illusionist Eisenheim (Norton) recognizes his former childhood love Sophie (Biel) who is assisting in a magic trick on stage and becomes smitten again. Prince Leopold (Sewell) sees the possibility of Sophie slipping away from him and wants Eisenheim shut down. Oh, oh, can Eisenheim make the prince disappear?This is a movie worth watching for pure entertainment. It is nicely paced, has good acting, dialogue and oh, yes, magic. What's not to like? Of course, the magic is movie magic, but who cares? It's all very well done. And, watching Inspector(Giamatti) Uhl (where do they get these names from?) try to discover how Eisenheim does his magic is a joy unto itself. We hope he will fail because we like Eisenheim and Sophie. Edward Norton seems to have an ability to really initiate good chemistry with his leading ladies. You buy into the relationship fast. Yes, there is a little bit of The Sting and The Usual Suspects in here and one could expect no less. I am not advocating the movie or the stars for an Oscar, but it was truly amazing. Was it the mirrors? Anyway, very good entertainment. Need more like this one. Violence: YesSex: There is a sex scene, but you see nothing and you are not sure what parts of a body you are seeing.

Children of Men," Powerful Nightmare
","The year is 2027 and man has not procreated for the last 18-years when a virus or plague caused this condition in everyone worldwide. Well, that is until this movie. The movie opens with the news that the youngest living person on the planet has just died and he was 18-years old. Theo (Owen) takes on the responsibility of taking a pregnant Kee (Ashitey) to her people (shhhhh, no one knows she is with child). Yes, this is all about hope.If you haven't had nightmares since you were a kid, you can get reacquainted with them thru this movie. One shouldn't go from watching a movie where a whole country goes killing-mad (Blood Diamond) to another movie (this one) where all of England goes killing-mad. It's a nightmare. Theo and Kee are constantly dodging bullets, bombs and rocket grenades thru some of the most desolate and bombed out towns and cities one could only conjure up in a nightmare. So I guess it's safe to say the cinematography is really good?What we have here is this: someone took a short story and made a long movie out of it. Plus to confuse us, they decided to make everyone speak English, you know, from London Town and the only ones we could understand, for the most part, were Michael Caine and Owen. Okay, we understood Kee as she was clear as a bell with no accent. However, I think, in the future, for 'English' type movies that Michael Caine should play all the parts so we can understand what the heck was said. When the director views the movie before the editors get it, can't he tell no one can understand much of the dialogue? The problem is that he knows the lines and anything close will pass. What a guy.Maybe the movie should have been titled The Great Escape (already taken) because 95% of the movie is Theo and Kee running trying to get Kee to safety and no one can be trusted. I don't call dodging bullets acting, but that's not being fair as there was some good stuff in here by Moore, Caine, and Owen. Except for not hearing clearly (maybe it's me) the acting by the entire cast was fine. And, the dogs and chickens performed well too. My problem is that the whole movie reeks of a nightmare no one should have or even live thru in a conscious state. I hope they didn't waste color film on this because everything I saw was black and white. Ooops, the police car lights were blinking blue come to think of it. So if you can console yourself that it all about hope you might enjoy this movie. But, it is brutal in the telling, so you are warned. And, as a thriller, it's pretty good too. However, I need to pick up some of those almost-comedic comedies. Violence: Yes, Sex: No, Nudity: Yes, Language: Yes",6,3,6,1 April 2007
Million Dollar Baby," Powerful
","Frankie (Eastwood) agrees to take on a girl fighter (Swank) to make a run for the title.To borrow a few words from the late Selma Diamond (Night Court): I laughed, I cried, it became a part of me.I don't think I have ever been affected by a movie as this one. All good. The dialog was simply the best. And, a lot of it was funny, really good stuff.And, get this: this was the first draft by the screen writer, Paul Haggis. Eastwood didn't want to change anything. Something, eh? I know this from watching the second DVD in the package.Eastwood, Freeman and Swank worked nothing short of a classic. All the acting was first class. You won't forget this one. The boxing scenes were real, I believe. If not, you could have fooled me. Yes, I watched the other movies up for Best Picture and said that Million Dollar Baby better be better than good to beat this group. WOW! That is all I can say. The others, while good, never really stood a chance. You'll see.There is only one little thing that really didn't fit. Frankie gives Maggie a robe to wear into boxing rings. The words on the back are in Greek or Gaelic. He tells her that he will tell her what the words mean when she wins the big one. She wins a number of fights leading up to the title fight wearing the robe. In today's world, those words would have been mentioned in magazines, newspapers, TV spots etc. Also, some fans might have called out the meaning too. Maybe it was just a case of Maggie wanting to hear the words from Frank. Maybe. Anyway, go see the movie and you, too, will learn what the words mean. No, you don't have to fight anyone, just pay for the ticket or the DVD rental.As much as I liked this movie, it still did not make me a fan of women boxing. Doesn't make sense to me. But, this movie made sense and is really one of the most powerful movies I have ever seen. Oh, yeah, it's not just about boxing.",10,2,4,15 July 2005
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Excellent History Lesson
","This is a slice of life for an hour and a half of the controversies in the early 1950s with CBS's TV journalist Edward R. Murrow (Strathairn) going up against the USAF and Senator Joseph McCarthy who seemed to accuse everyone of being a communist if they didn't agree with him.You are only going to see a small part of the life of Murrow who is played perfectly by David Strathairn, but this is more than something about someone's life. This is a part of our history and should be mandatory viewing in all High Schools across the nation and it's better than a Classic Comic Book (are they still around?). This was a very serious time in our history. And, you are going to see how effective Edward R. Murrow was.The movie is shot in Black and White, but it didn't need to be. There was enough actual B/W TV coverage of Sen McCarthy and that would have been sufficient for effects, but no matter. The actual TV coverage of Sen McCarthy was genius at work, hence no one needed to 'play' him. You actually get to see history being made. You see the real thing. And, Strathairn's portrayal of Murrow was as close to the real thing as anything I have ever seen. I was a kid back in the early 1950s and I had heard of Edward R. Murrow, of course, but I was a kid and didn't pay too much attention at the time. What I do remember about the time was that the whole country seemed to be watching the Army vs McCarthy hearings and they kind of overshadowed the Murrow broadcasts except for the politicals and the news people. And, now we are here again. Can you see any similarities between then and now? We learn that Murrow really didn't like doing the Person to Person TV shows, but he did those to keep CBS brass happy with advertisers. The head of CBS played by Frank Langella never censored Murrow, but cringed every time Murrow went on a crusade. Very good interplay here.I was surprised to learn that CBS, at the time, had a policy whereby two CBS employees could not be married to each other. How that played out in the film was never really explained unless I missed it.Acting all around was excellent. The movie was nominated for 5-Oscars: Best Actor (Strathairn), Art Direction, Best Director (Clooney), Original Screenplay and Best Picture. George Clooney did an excellent job as Director.Now for Murrow's sign off. Terrible, terrible, terrible. You would think someone would have taken Murrow aside and said, 'Hey, come up with something more people friendly. This sounds like you are in Las Vegas with friends for a night of gambling and you tell them you are tired and are going to bed and leave them with: Good Night and Good Luck (at the tables).' But no one did and here we are.All in all an excellent slice of life regarding our history. Again, this should be mandatory viewing in all High Schools across the nation. Good night and good luck with that.",10,1,2,17 March 2006
The Greatest Game Ever Played," Needed More Suspense
","This is the true story of Francis Ouimet, who was not born on the right side of the tracks, but who had the talent to become the Tiger Woods of his day.If you are going to title your film The Greatest Game Ever Played you should put more suspense and tension into the last match, the one between Ouimet (LaBeouf)and Harry Vardon (Dillane). There was more tension and suspense between Outmet and his father (who didn't want him to waste his time on this game) than there was in that final match. Golfers who barely have heard the name Ouimet were, of course, sitting on the edge of their seats even though they thought they knew who would win anyway. Golfers do that. They sit up and take notice regardless. And, why is that? Because you have two of the best golfers of the day, for that day, competing and they are dead even for the most part and they are playing in the US Open. For Golfers it doesn't get much better than that.But, you see, not only do golfers go to the movies, but non-golfers as well go also and this is a much broader audience. And, the suspense just wasn't there for them. Add to this that Harry Vardon also was born on the wrong side of the tracks there was more than enough room for a lot of tension and suspense, but I didn't feel it. And, I play golf. One of the nicest things I learned was that Harry Vardon was always the perfect gentleman who had already won five British Opens. There should also have been more interplay between Ouimet and Vardon to create a friendly tension so to speak.OK, then how do you create that tension and suspense for that last match? We didn't have the TV analysts we have today, but the director could have showed us every shot on a certain hole that made a difference and he could have had the sports news-writers comment among themselves how things were going and well, doing a shot-by-shot analysis. But, show us the complete hole for the shots by each. OK, there was some of that, but nothing that brought any tension into play, and the shots were isolated ones. A player in a trap trying to get out, a player with a long putt. No tension here.I still liked this movie. Good thing this wasn't in 3-D. The way the balls were shot towards the audience I would have been in the back row in no time at all. Really good animation. I guess that's what it was, and those shots were terrific. I'm still ducking.Two things that I didn't understand. 1) What happened to the rich-girl who followed Ouimet around and 2) We weren't told what Ouimet accomplished afterward unless I missed it.Overall, great acting performance all around.",8,0,2,18 April 2006
Blood Diamond," Should have won the Oscar for Best Picture
","Solomon (Hounsou)a fisherman turned diamond miner for the rebels in Sierra Leone finds and hides a Blood Diamond (also known as Pink). Danny Archer (DiCaprio), a diamond smuggler knows Solomon hid the diamond. The two must work together to achieve their very different goals. I thought I had seen enough movies where violence and sheer killing madness ruled, but I was not prepared for this one. It is the most violent I have ever seen, but consider this: the choreography of such killings was outstanding. That is a terrible thing to say, but when you see what is going on, everything flowed like poetry. You couldn't help but notice that. That director gave us a sense of something we should never see, or hear about. It was like I was there and I kept hoping it would all stop and never start again. You keep asking yourself how could human beings act this way and I am talking about the rebels in Sierra Leone in the late 1990s. These things really did happen and most of the world knew nothing about them. Now, get this: the rebels recruited young boys to do much of the killing too. Solomon's son was one of them. The story is fiction, but the events in Sierra Leone, at that time, were very real.I know The Departed won the Oscar for Best Picture, but I would have given it to this movie. All in all, the production, and the acting was a cut above everything else. DiCaprio is in a league of his own and he makes all the others in the cast better. There is no other way to say it even at his young age. Yes, he came up with a Rhodesian South African accent and that was fine. Marlon Brando did much the same thing with accents dependent on what was needed for the story. DiCaprio also did a New Jersey accent in The Departed. It worked. The movie is long but never drags. When it looks like it may slow down, here comes a gang of rebels or soldier children in jeeps killing everything in sight. At the end of the movie a notice says that today Sierra Leone is quiet, but that there are still 200,000 soldier children. That's still scary. The movie itself and the director Edward Zwick should have been nominated and they weren't. DiCaprio was nominated for Best Actor and that's something, but not good enough. Do the nominations have to be limited to five? Violence: Yes,Sex: No, Nudity: No, Language: Yes",10,0,1,29 March 2007
Inside Man," Weak Ending
","People dressed as painters take over a bank and hold hostages. The police cannot figure out why it's taking so long for them to rob the bank and try to escape. Detective Frazier (Washington) believes there is more going on than a simple bank robbery.This is a slow movie, but it holds your interest because you and the police and the hostages have no idea what is going on. You are led to believe a bank robbery is taking place because that is what it looks like so you go with it. The police and you savor every clue and the director, Spike Lee, throws you off guard often by letting you think some of his turns have something to do with what is actually going on.The acting by all is first class and the story would have had more of an impact had the ending to this robbery made sense. Maybe I just didn't get it. At least I wasn't stressed out because there was no suspense or tension. My interest was held, but I wasn't on the edge of my chair. After you find out what the real purpose of the 'robbery' is, you begin to question yourself as to why you sat there for 128 minutes. I sat there for this? For this? No, someone made a mistake. Not for this! See what I mean? That is where I was at the end of this movie. I was in that same place when I watched END GAME with Cuba Gooding Jr. Again, everything was fine until the weak ending came around.",6,1,2,21 August 2006
The Da Vinci Code," A History Lesson, sort of
","Prof Robert Langdon (Hanks) is about to be accused of murdering the curator of the Louvre, but the way the curator's body is cut up provides clues to secrets hidden by Leonardo Da Vinci, and it is up to Sophie (Tautou), a police cryptologist, to convince Langdon that there is more to all this than a simple murder. Running away instead of being arrested sounds like a good idea to Langdon.If you are a history-buff, you might agree that the findings of the Da Vinci Code are palatable. If you are not a history-buff you still might find this story, that starts at the time of Jesus Christ, interesting anyway. Questions: Were Mary Magdaline and Jesus married? Who was purported to be the real head of the Catholic Church? What is the Holy Grail and where is it? Do we have your attention now? Whatever the beliefs of an audience, story is presented well and it flows quite logically. The clues come slow enough to allow an audience to understand the complexity of it all. The acting, dialogue, and photography, in general, are very good. I only found one flaw and it had to do with direction. When Langdon and Sophie escape from bank official with a gun, he is knocked down and the two run away. I would have made sure that bank official didn't get a chance to use the gun again, and, at the very least, take the gun, and then run; and, well he gets up and starts shooting for all he is worth.Anyway, all questions are answered and you are not left hanging. Whether you agree with the answers is up to you. Remember, it's only a movie, and it's never too late to become a history buff and you can do your own research. Now, where did they put that Grail thing?",7,1,2,18 November 2006
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Very Entertaining
","Two top assassins (Pitt and Jolie) meet, fall in love, and stay married for 5-6 years without either one telling the other what he/she really does. Of course they each had cover jobs each knew about. Then one day each is assigned to take the other one out. Oh, oh, this can't be good.Pitt and Jolie bring their A games to this exciting and very entertaining movie. We are not talking Oscars here, but a very good movie, even paced and with humor too. If you had the brass contract for this movie you would be quite wealthy by now. Yes, there is a lot of shooting, and explosions, special effects stunts(very spectacular), and car chases (Whoa!) and well, everything you want in a good spy movie. It's all here. Every bit as good as the Bourne Identity, but a little more on the lighter side, perhaps. You like these characters and hope they work things out. I was somewhat reminded of the War of the Roses, and although this movie really goes for the jugular, it's light-hearted enough not to be scary or gory.One of the things I liked best about this movie is when the characters went after each other, there was no malice and in some ways it was quite comical and still very serious. I am dying to say more, but I will yell those comments into a pillow to get them out of my system.Very entertaining and I didn't want it to end and I still have questions regarding the ending. You might too.",9,1,2,1 December 2005
The Departed," Excellent
","Billy Costigan (DiCaprio) is a mole inside Costello's (Nicholson) crime gang. Colin Sullivan (Damon) is a mole inside the Boston Police Dept. When the cops and Costello find out each has a mole among them, things get more than interesting.It is more than nice to have an all star cast performing an excellent story. This doesn't happen often and doesn't disappoint. Plus the fact that it moved along at such a lively pace the 2 ½ hours didn't seem like 2 ½ hours. One can easily see how this was nominated for Best Picture (which it won) and also how Martin Scorsese was nominated for Best Director (which he won). And, one can also see how some of the stars could have been nominated for Best Actor or Best Supporting Actor: DiCaprio, Damon or Nicholson (but none were). But, there is one area that surely needs to be recognized and that is the film editing, and by-God it won for that too. This was a cat mouse-chess game and the shots went back and forth at a rapid pace at times and yet, and you didn't lose the thread. Great editing job.This is a movie you have to stay with. If you give yourself an intermission while the DVD is still running, you may lose something you probably need to know later on. So pay attention.When we saw the Academy Awards we saw Jack Nicholson looking like Mr. Clean, Lex Luthor, Kojack, or Daddy Warbucks (take your pick) and we feel the reason for this is because Jack saw himself in this movie and realized he had a really bad hair day all the way through. Also, did anyone but me notice some facial similarities between DiCaprio and Nicholson? Hmmmm.Everything was excellent, the cinematography, the dialogue, the editing, the acting and yes, the music was, at times, very good too.Violence:Yes, Sex: Yes, Nudity:Partial, Language:Yes",10,2,5,28 February 2007
Glory Road," Terrific
","This is based upon a true story. You don't have to be a basketball fan to like this movie.Don Haskins (Lucas) takes an almost non-existent Division 1 Basketball team, Texas Western Miners, all the way to the NCAA Finals.This movie is about racism first, basketball second and shows the country that segregation is not the way to go. Okay, okay, it's about basketball and the racism thing just worked itself out. Don Haskins changed the way basketball is played in the United States, and yes, there were many bumps along the way, but things smoothed out in the long run. And, yes, 'things' are still in the process of being smoothed out. Yes, Haskins changed the way basketball is played, but the players were the ones to let Haskins know that, ' if you want to win, let us play our game.' And Haskins, to his credit, saw the wisdom in that.I couldn't get over how well put together this movie is. It simply flowed as though it had a life of its own, and maybe it did. Since basketball and racism were the two main things in here there wasn't much room for character development, as for say Haskins, but who cares? This moved along at such a lively pace that you weren't aware that anything was missing.Terrific cast, dialogue and acting performances all around. The games themselves were like they were live before us and the choreography and editing were nothing short of fantastic.Is it just me or does Josh Lucas sometimes remind you of both Matthew McConaughey and Kevin Costner almost at the same time? Look again. And, although her part as Haskins's wife, was small, Emily Deschanel comes across as extremely sexy as well as beautiful. She reminded me of Gena Davis when she started out in TV and movies. I am sure we shall see more of her in the future. Jon Voight was exceptional and we need to see more of him.Stay tuned at the end of the story to find out what happened to the real life players. But, there is one criticism I have regarding sub-titles or captions when this is done. The Directors must know these movies are going to DVD so stop with the small lettering and white on white. Give us a chance to read the thing without binoculars or significant eye-strain.",9,0,1,18 June 2006
War of the Worlds," Looked Real to Me
","Ray (Cruise) a divorced father of two receives his kids from the mother for the weekend and all hell breaks loose. The War has started.I have no idea what they used or how they did this, but the special effects of roads buckling, buildings simply losing their adhesion and collapsing, Alien Tri-Pods walking thru brick buildings, bridges separating and turning over, and cars flying thru the air like they had some place to go was unlike any special effects I have ever seen. And, it all looked very real.My thoughts went to the Orson Wells' broadcast (I read about it) in the late 1930s when Americans really believed they were being invaded by beings from Mars. That must have been scary stuff. This was scary stuff too. No one knew what to do, or where to go when the Tri-Pods the aliens used came to life obliterating everything in their way. Ray needed to get his kids to their mother in Boston and it seemed as though everyone else had someone in Boston to see also as there were miles of a ribbon of human flesh headed that way.After the initial attacks, things quieted down for the rest of the movie. That was a mistake because the second half of the movie sort of died. Yes, there were still some scary moments, but not on the scale that opened the movie. Oh, there was the human interest story regarding Ray and what a lousy father he must have been, but still he fought to get his kids to Boston. Then, some uncomfortable scenes with Tim Robbins comes into play as he tries to help Ray with the girl (Fanning) now since the boy had to go to the front to see what was happening for himself. Teenagers! I couldn't figure out why Dakota Fanning was in this movie. There was nothing striking about her performance and I still believe she will be one of our best actresses in time. No, I think she is on a mission to work with all the biggest names in the business before she is 15. I could be wrong. Speaking of being 15, Fanning looked every bit 10-yrs old in the beginning. By the end of the movie she looked like a young teen-ager. Hmmmmm.Where the Aliens came from was never explained. Mars was never mentioned. Everything seemed to happen on the way to Boston, as there was no mention of anything being shown in other countries and yes, the power outages may have had something to do with that.How did it end, you ask? How did we beat the unbeatable alien race hell bent on exterminating us when everything our army did was of no consequence? Well, as smaaaaaaart (we're in Boston now) as the Aliens were, they overlooked one thing.Overall, pretty good and worth going to see if only for the special effects. Looked real to me.",7,0,1,27 November 2005
Wedding Crashers," The Hype Failed Us
","Two businessmen, partners and friends, Beckwith (Wilson), Grey (Vaughn) have a unique hobby: crashing weddings to meet girls. Seems to work for them.Here's the deal: if you are young and have a group of friends watching this movie with beer, you will probably like this movie. If you eliminate the friends and the beer you must see this is a tedious movie that tries to be funny and fails. Oh, there are some funny moments to be sure, but they are few and instantly forgettable or I would relate one or two here. Just can't recall any. There are other 'funny moments' that rely heavily on sexual circumstances. And, in some cases one or two of these circumstances are actually so crude to the point I couldn't believe the scene was happening at all. In one instance, imagine some goings on under the table at a family dinner, and as you watch there is almost nothing left to the imagination. Not for kids.The only good performances were from Henry Gibson and Christopher Walken. Walken sleep-walked thru this as if to say to himself, 'Hang in there. It will be over soon.' Gibson plays the unsuspecting, but somewhat suspecting character we all love to watch. He has the old time comedians' sense or timing within him. He does a good job always. Jane Seymour was wasted in this. I don't know why she agreed to have her character with a new breast job tell Beckwith (Wilson) to feel them and once he does, she calls him a pervert. Oh, you don't see anything of hers except from a side view and a body double was probably used anyway. Nothing erotic here. Just a clumsy scene. Will Ferrell probably paid his way into this and once again showed us why he should be selling cars.Owen Wilson is good at explanations and you believe everything he says, and that will get him into heaven. He is not a bad actor, but he needed someone else to play off of than Vince Vaughn. There was no chemistry between them. Vaughn is not funny, better than Ferrell, but still not funny. He delights in talking at light-speed and after the first 10-words are out you have lost any interest or meaning in what he was trying to say. You just don't care because he goes on for too long. The Director probably grooved on this. He was the only one.Yes, the hype fooled me again. Going to have to do something about that, but I don't know what because I keep giving things another chance. Maybe I should get some friends and some beer and watch this again. No, once was enough, but I could use a drink about now.",2,3,5,7 January 2006
The Last King of Scotland," It Was Okay
","Scotsman Dr. Nicholas Garrigan (McAvoy) graduates from school and decides to make Uganda his first practice. He is befriended by Idi Amin (Whitaker) who makes him is personal doctor.I remember reading things about Idi Amin when I was working overseas and the movie hardly touches on the brutality this man was capable of. And, through the eyes of Dr. Garrigan, the movie touches on Amin's violent mood swings, but doesn't go far enough. He almost becomes likable and I hope that wasn't the intention.Looking back on it there is probably no one better to portray Idi Amin than Forest Whitaker. He did a good job and was rewarded with an Oscar Nomination for Best Actor. The rest of the cast and crew were very good too, and James McAvoy could have copped the Best Supporting Actor Award, but no one thought of him. Too bad as he was the barometer we gauged Amin by and he performed exceptionally well. Too bad no one thought of him.Now, what does all this have to do with the title of The Last King of Scotland? Idi Amin liked Scotland and it's people and referred to himself that way at times. Nothing has been given away and the movie is worth seeing to catch a glimpse of what this evil man was about. And, again, the movie hardly touches on his brutality, and the director wanted you to get some sleep at night after seeing it.Violence:Yes, Sex: Yes, Nudity: Yes, Language: Yes",7,0,0,24 April 2007
Stranger Than Fiction," Quite Good (little did I know)
","IRS tax auditor, Harold Crick (Ferrell) is a character in a story being written by author Kay Eiffel (Thompson), but he can hear Kay's voice telling him, in the third person, what he has already done since he got up in the morning. We assume that, as Kay speaks, she is typing as well. All gets worse when Kay lets slip that she is looking for a way to kill off Harold Crick in the novel. Harold hears this and is now more than worried. Who wouldn't be? Little did I know that I would ever be praising a Will Ferrell movie, but that is exactly what I am doing. Finally, he is doing what he should be doing and that is acting in a dramatic role (selling cars was my second choice for him). His performance is perfect. There I said it.Dustin Hoffman, as a literary analyst, is always good in his dead-pan way. Emma Thompson shines as the author, who constantly searches for a way to end her novel and the life of (gulp!) Harold Crick; and Queen Latifah, does a good, but understated, job as a literary enforcer trying to get Kay to finish the novel for the publisher. But, we fell in love with a baker: Maggie Gyllenhaal almost at first sight and Harold falls for her too and doesn't want to die. We just hope her tattoo's are washable.Yes, there are some laughs in here - very subtle ones - but nothing memorable to write about. And, 'little did I know' is a clever catch phrase in the story and you will see how it's tied in.This movie should win, hands down, for Original Screenplay and writers and authors will take note and understand the concept of parallel universes which would offer an infinite number of events. So be on the lookout for copycat writers using a mix between fictional characters in a story and real people. To analyze this any further would get us into time travel, chicken or the eggwell you get the idea. We should get some interesting reading and maybe a movie or two.Actually, I did know that Will Ferrell would be good in a dramatic role. I have always said that. An Oscar nomination for him? Um, maybe. Will I get a finder's fee? Hmmmm Probably not.Violence: No, Sex: No, Nudity: Yes, backsides only as characters pass within a men's shower on the way to the swimming pool, Language: Yes, I think I heard Hoffman drop an F Bomb",8,0,0,2 April 2007
Hitch," Smith Rules
","Will Smith can carry a movie all by himself, even this one that had few funny moments. It is billed as a comedy after all. The selection of Kevin James remains a mystery to me. The man is not funny, telegraphs everything he does, and he essentially tries too hard to be funny and fails miserably. I can only offer this advice to him: go back and watch the masters, Chaplin, Gleason, Blue, etc and learn timing from them. And, yes, watching reruns of the Friends TV show may help too. Failing that go to drama or sell cars.The only funny thing I found in this 'romantic comedy' was when Hitch eats some food and discovers that he is allergic to whatever it was he ate. His reaction and facial changes were actually laugh out loud funny. I guess this catches us by surprise. Also, Hitch gives some very good lines (advice to the men he is helping) and there may be some truth to some of them.OK, aside from the movie not being funny except for the food allergy scene, this is a fairly good story. Hitch and tabloid reporter (Mendes, who is very beautiful, by the way) try to get it on with the usual girl-boy point and counter point sparring. The sparring part of it is good, but the love angle doesn't work here. No one is focused enough for that. This is the part that is most ironical too. Hitch always professes to the guy he is helping to be 'focused' (toward the girl) and here (as actor Smith) playing the part he is not focused enough for the audience to see he has feelings for Mendes. Oh, he goes through the usual love-pain gyrations, but it just didn't seem real for me. Sorry. Maybe he knows Jada (his real wife) will be watching.The supporting cast aside from James all did a very good job. Will Smith is very talented and I truly believe he would make an excellent James Bond. This has nothing to do with this movie. I just needed to say it. Smith rules.",5,0,0,18 June 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Great. Really
","The Chancellor (McDiarmid) fights the Jedi over control of the Republic and enlists the aid of Anakin (Christensen) Skywalker, the future Darth Vader. I really didn't want to watch this one. It was the last of the Prequels and I figured it would go the same way as the others, boring. Too much like a video game with the special effects taking over and putting me to sleep like the others. Wrong. This one was great. Well, to be fair, the battle scene that opened this movie seemed like it would last forever: Got the toys, got to show them, you know. And, I was ready to shut this down,but am glad I held off. There was an actual story here with actors actually speaking more than one sentence at a time. It was all good. The acting, music,cinematography and the dialogue were all good. But, I got to thinking. Suppose this movie was the first Star Wars ever. What would we have missed in the other prequels? Nothing. This could have started it all off. I am not too sure about this but, the weaponry, fighter planes, missiles and fire-power in general seemed to be more advanced than what was shown in the movies starting with the original Star Wars movie. Could be wrong, butSee where I am going with this?As good as this movie is I am glad this ends the Star Wars sagas. The special effects, and computer graphics had taken over and this is not good. I know a lot of time, money, effort etc go into these special effects, and they are spectacular, but they go on for too long and put me to sleep. And, you really can't tell who is doing what to whom anyway. You just watch one fireworks display after another. The first Star Wars movie was such a departure from everything else we had ever seen that we were hooked on the new technology. But as time marched on the special effects took over, and while good, they went on for too long and this is not good.",8,3,6,7 November 2005
Lord of War," Good Outline
","Uri Orlov (Cage) is an arms dealer who has no conscience and he does this work, why? Because he is good at it. And, if he didn't do it, someone else would. Pays pretty good too.This is a good outline of someone who is an arms dealer. I say outline because it assumes we know a lot of things: how does he pay for the arms; where are the arms stored; how do they get from one location to another? I am sure there are more questions but you get the idea. Do we really need to know all the details? Probably not, but I say they should be addressed and not have the movie jump all around to show that he deals in the mid-East as well as Russia and Africa. If one instance was completely shown in the movie I think we can make a leap as to what the other deals involved. And, the movie does jump all around. Probably by design to keep us from getting the popcorn we craved when we first sat down.However, I like Nicolas Cage and this is still a good movie despite too much jumping around from one location to another. He is an excellent actor and we do get the idea what this movie is all about. Where the movie could have saved itself more would have been to add more suspense and tension. There wasn't enough. It's entertaining and there are some very good lines in here or if you prefer, witticisms or truths may be an even better word.The ending is somewhat of a shocker, but when you think about it, maybe not.",7,5,8,23 January 2006
The Good Shepherd," Long and Boring
","Edward Wilson (Damon) is a career CIA agent who is trying to unravel the mystery of who caused the Bay of Pigs operation in Cuba to fail. The story goes loosely into the beginnings of the CIA as well and some Russian defections.This movie reminded me of The Spy Who Came in From the Cold. That, to me, was long and boring too, but admittedly, a better told story on film. I think for viewing future spy movies we should be equipped with the Green Night Vision Glasses and one of those large hearing discs along with earphones. Too much in this movie was in staged in dark, shadowy areas; and too much of this movie was barely audible due to 'well, you know, we have to talk softly so others can't hear.' The Director didn't let the audience hear too much as we might endanger national security. I gave up rewinding the DVD to determine what was going on at times.The acting was dead-pan all around except for a couple outbursts by Wilson's wife, Margaret (Jolie), and she was totally underutilized. Where is Laura Croft when you need her? This could have used some humor too.I need to explain something. It is my understanding that the Wilson character was based on a real live CIA agent, who actually, was the way Matt Damon played him in the movie. So we can forgive the dead-pan portrayal by Matt Damon as he was doing the right thing. That doesn't forgive the rest of the cast or the director who needed to put some life into this. I mean we can't have Angelina doing an outburst too often.You know, if truth be told, being a Good Shepherd is a long and boring job too. Violence:Yes, Sex: Yes, dark scenes but you know what was going on. Nudity : No, too dark to see anything Language:Yes, there was some, not much",5,2,5,4 April 2007
The Queen," First Class all the Way
","The Queen Queen Elizabeth II, James Cromwell, Michael SheenFirst Class all the WayQueen Elizabeth takes too long acknowledging Princess Diana's death in 1997 to the point some are talking about abolishing the monarchy in England. Oh, oh, this can't be good. (Bob, you put Queen Elizabeth down as one of the actors) --Yeah, so? She did a good job-- (Yes, but Helen Mirren played the part of the Queen) --You sure? She was really believable, awfully goodAny time Inquiring minds can take a peek into the lives of the monarchy in England, we and the rest of the world are there. We want to see how the other half lives, the half that we can never be and have no real interest in becoming. We want to see how they break their bread at the table, what they consider when they dress themselves, and, yes, what they think of the rest of the world.This movie could be considered embarrassing to the English monarchy. Why did the Royals wait so long to see they were making a huge mistake in not showing the proper timely grief in Diana's death? It could have cost them the monarchy had they not given in to Tony Blair's (Sheen) suggestions. We shall never know. But, could it be that they knew something we can never know for sure? Was the whole story told here? There are some reports that Diana was never in that car with Dodi Fayed and that it was someone else, a decoy. Okay, enough conspiracy.After the Oscars for which Helen Mirren won the Award for Best Actress, she told one interviewer that she was to have a meeting with Queen Elizabeth. My question is who will emerge from that meeting to the point no one will notice who the real Queen is? Now, that would be a movie.And, when they do meet I am sure they will laugh out loud together regarding Mrs. Blair's curtesy. It was described to the Queen as 'lame' and when you see it and also see the Queen's reaction to it, you will laugh as I did. I am still laughing.The whole production was first class. The performances by all were simply outstanding. But, since we peered in, what other things did we learn about Queen Elizabeth? She was a mechanic after WWII; she keeps a diary; she drives vehicles around her property without security guards; she wears glasses that are too big for her face; she is called 'cabbage' by Prince Phillip; and despite how she acts before her people, she is most loved and always forgiven. Another thing I learned was that performances by the British about the British should have their own Oscar category. To put them in the same ring with US gangsters, cowboys, businessmen, etc, just doesn't do the British justice, but they will win almost every time. We don't stand a chance.(So you liked the movie and Helen Mirren's performance?) --Yes, but are you sure Queen Elizabeth didn't play herself in this? Wonder what is in that diary?--Violence: No, Sex:No, Nudity: No, Language: Yes, Mrs. Blair (Helen McCrory utters one F-bomb)",10,1,2,28 April 2007
Casino Royale," WOW, when is the next one?
","James Bond (Craig) goes toe-to-toe at the Poker table with banker La Chiffre ( Mikkeisen) who supports terrorists.This is based on Ian Flemming's first novel. And, here we see a different Bond, one who is arrogant, and has an attitude, but forgive him, as he is on his first mission. He has just earned his OO License-To-Kill status and apparently likes it. We learn how he gets the Aston Martin, why he prefers married women, how he likes his Vodka Martini, how he gets his first custom-made tuxedo, and how he makes mistakes to the dismay of M (Dench), his boss.What we don't see is Q with his gadgets from other Bond movies, no sharp one-liners Bond usually quips after some encounter with a bad guy, no hat toss onto the hat tree as Miss Moneypenny watches because there is no hat and also no Moneypenny. And, here I am not sure, but I don't think I heard the line, 'Bond, James Bond' uttered by Craig. I am almost positive I didn't hear it.This is an exciting James Bond and we hope he stays around a while (shades of George Lazenby). This one is energetic and in shape and he needs to be after the all out foot-chase in the construction yard in the beginning of the movie. The stunts were awesome in that construction yard and the way many things were toppled and fell it was amazing no one got hurt. They were so real I checked myself into a hospital just in case.The supporting cast were all excellent and even though the La Chiffre (Mikkeison) character played it too subtle and cool, he was an enjoyable bad guy. Kind of looked like Tom Berringer too. Dench as M was perfect and Eva Green is a beautiful and sexy Bond girl.I know I read the book years ago and do not recall that poker was the game of choice in there. It was Baccarat, which is featured in most of the Bond movies. This does not take anything away from the story, just wanted you to know.So what can we expect from future Bond movies? Will it be Poker instead of Baccarat? Will he ask where Q is with his gadgets? Will Miss Moneypenny show up? Will he finally say, 'Shaken, not stirred ' as he gives his drink order? Are we going back to some evil Bond nemesis who is bent on destroying much of the world with missiles, super lasers, bombs or a change in weather patterns? I guess we will have to wait and see. But, we should see a more structured, and mature Bond and one who knows not to break into M's house anymore.And, aside from the Bond music not playing as often or as loud as it should have, I just have one question: when is the next one? Violence:Yes, Sex: No, Nudity: Yes, Bond is stripped and tortured. And you thought something else? Language: No",9,1,6,18 March 2007
Fantastic Four," Should have stayed a Comic Book
","A ride to outer space to witness a cosmic storm to experiment on human DNA goes bad when the storm appears earlier than predicted and has life changing effects on the DNA of the crew. Oh, oh! Yes, this should have stayed a comic book fantasy or maybe someone else should have put this together. There was something very wrong from the very beginning to the very end. Remember when we used to watch some movies and we would see the mouth move and hear the words a little later on? Well, this wasn't exactly like that, but close enough. The dialogues were all low-key and monotone as though the actors were rehearsing lines instead of being in a movie with the cameras running. Maybe a lot of the dialogue was dubbed in later. Anyway, something was wrong.The Fantastic Four were: the girl who could become invisible (Alba); the Hulk creature called the Thing(Chiklis); the Plastic Man (Gruffudd); and the Human Torch (Evans). Affected but not one of the good guys was Dr. Doom (McMahon) who interfaced with metals.Some of the special effects were very good, some were not and it showed. Most of the movie was taken up with the bickering among the Fan-4 and this became most annoying leaving us to wonder when the story would start. Well, there really was no story here and everything was an identity crisis among all.I don't recall this as a comic book, but I probably would have liked it far better then what I viewed on the DVD. And, the worse thing about all this is that there may be sequels. OMG!",3,0,1,14 December 2005
Sin City," Good, Bad and Ugly
","Four slices of life: Detective Hartigan(Willis) saves a young girl from a pedophile; tough guy, Marv (Rourke) is framed for a murder of the prostitute he was just with; Dwight (Owen) helps the sisterhood retain control of Sin City; and Hartigan again meets the young girl he saved years ago.The Good: this is like looking at a comic book (from which the stories are derived) come to life, literally come to life. I mean every scene looks like a panel in a comic book that springs to life. And, this is awesome. Almost like magic. The action is what we see in our mind's eye when we read comics. It literally comes to life as we read on. Isn't that what a comic book panel is supposed to do? Well, it does it perfectly in this movie. The special effects are stunning and I have never seen anything like them. Most of the movie is in black and white with color thrown in at certain times. The acting also is good, but the cinematography and special effects win here.The Bad: I would have enjoyed this even more if the stories weren't as violent as they were. I saw no purpose in the overkill (the only word for it) when people were being maimed, tortured, thrown here and there, and then killed. In a comic book panel it probably doesn't have the same negative impact because we go quickly to the next panel (well, most of us do), but here the comic book panel comes to life and we can't go on until the director wants us to move on. So we stay and watch something almost real happening. Repeat: almost real. Overkill because it continues (when it should stop) and stays there when you think it should be over. Yes, I had the FF Button at the ready, but I wanted to see how long the butchery would last. It lasted too long. No purpose served here except to titillate. Much too violent.The Ugly: We see hands and legs sliced off, bodies still alive being eaten by wolves and body parts being yanked off and jettisoned every which way. It got to be a bit much. Truly Ugly. We need this? Hartigan, Marv and Dwight are ordinary people until someone tries to kill them. Then you would think they were Clark Kent aka Superman. They are hard to kill or stop and they keep coming back when you know they don't have any more breath in them to continue. I ran out of breath just watching. But continue they do. Somehow, they find their second, third, fourth etc winds and continue to fight and try not to be taken out or killed.If you thought there was too much violence in Pulp Fiction or Natural Born Killers, you have a big surprise waiting for you with this one. The cinematography and special effects are outstanding and you could say that it is a true work of art, but the violence is really too much. And, that brings it down for entertainment value. This is definitely not for kids......some adults too.",7,3,6,18 August 2005
Coach Carter," Terrific
","Ken Carter (Jackson) takes over a losing California high school basketball team and employs extreme measures to turn things around.Yes, we have seen this before: a hard-assed coach molds his players into the image he desires for them. Yes, Samuel L. Jackson pontificates a lot in here. But all coaches pontificate to a large degree and it is justified. And, yes, it is a little too long, but so what? The basketball scenes are truly something to behold. The acting all around is excellent. And, yes, this is a terrific movie.Okay, now for the down side. Why does Carter wait until the team is 9-0 to find out his players are not living up the contract they signed with him? The players are falling behind academically and Carter locks them out of the gym until they turn things around. But, waiting until 9-0 doesn't seem to have bothered anyone. Something doesn't seem right here, but no one has questioned this aspect. Even Carter doesn't say he should have looked harder sooner. Why not? Now, in real life Carter owned a sports store. That is probably the reason I kept seeing different uniforms for just about every different game. When some basketball game scenes opened I had to wait until Carter calls the team over to the bench to see what players were his team, and then I knew what color jerseys his team had on. Before that, the action was so fast and furious I couldn't really tell. It's not like the players' faces were widely recognizable to viewers.This is must see movie.",8,4,4,25 June 2005
The Pursuit of Happyness," This is a must see
","This is based on a true story. Chris Gardner (Smith) has a hard time selling bone density machines to doctors and hospitals and looks for another way to help his family. He takes an internship at Dean Witter, a prominent brokerage firm. Problem is the internship pays no salary and he must prove himself for 6-months and still there is no guarantee of a salaried job. This is a not an easy movie to watch. No other way to say it. No matter what events are true or embellished by Hollywood theatrics, Chris Gardner had it extremely tough. Obstacle after obstacle is thrown in his path and yet he knows giving up is not an option.This could have turned into a real sappy mess, but it didn't. You get caught up in Chris' drive to succeed and along the way there is some humor to blunt the adversities that come his way. And, it was this humor that helped us believe that Chris might make it, but we kept asking when will this turn around for him as so much is thrown his way. He keeps asking his son to trust him and his 5-year old son always complies in the affirmative. I think many men would have given up or done something different, but Chris Gardner had something he could count on and he knew it. He had a talent. He was good with people and with numbers and for him that had to work in his favor. Will Smith and his real life son, Jaden Christopher Smith, make this a memorable movie. The performance by Will Smith is Oscar caliber and he was nominated for Best Actor in this movie. The rest of the cast performed well, but it is Will Smith, who alone, makes this work.

Cinderella Man," Another Beautiful Mind
","This is a true story about Jim Braddock (Crowe) who boxes and works on the docks to keep his family going during the Great Depression.Ron Howard seems to find beautiful minds to tell a story about. He directed Russell Crowe in A Beautiful Mind; and here he directs Russell Crowe in The Cinderella Man. But, this beautiful mind is not filled with math equations, but instead a mind consumed with doing the right thing no matter how difficult life turns out to be, and believe me it was a difficult life. He is as perfect or beautiful a human being as anyone can get. He is a good husband, father, and friend no matter what was thrown at him. If we could all wake up the next morning and say, 'I want to be like Jim Braddock' this would be a better world. I am a little older than most and I still want to grow up to be like Jim Braddock.If it weren't for people like Ron Howard and producers who take the risks of presenting stories like this we would have no clue, and they must be thanked time and time again.Yes, I have heard about Max Baer (former Heavyweight champion of the world), but I had never heard the name Jim Braddock when anyone talked about the fight game. What a story! The supporting cast was nothing short of perfect or beautiful too. Renee Zellweger, as Braddock's wife, lost that facial grimace that seemed to tell the world, 'I just ate a lemon.' I almost didn't recognize her and she is truly beautiful and one of our best actresses. Paul Giamatti lost that Richard Shiff (Toby, on the West Wing TV show) look and delivery (see Sideways) and was outstanding as Braddock's manager and trainer. Everyone was great. Can't say enough about the cast.I think all the performances were truly great, however, if anyone is talking Oscar, I would have to say the story and the direction overpowered everything. What a story! And, we are just learning about this now? Oh, yes there was some boxing in here too. Okay, a lot of boxing. The fight scenes were very good, but it's Braddock's story that is the most compelling. Actually, it is Braddock who is the most compelling.I think it's safe to say that Damon Runyon in one of his columns called Jim Braddock The Cinderella Man. Braddock's wife mentions that it sounded 'girly.' Believe me, there is nothing girly about Braddock.",9,1,2,11 December 2005
The Island," Don't look at any synopsis, just watch the movie
","People who have survived the contamination live in a controlled environment where they are cared for until they win the lottery to go to the Island, which is not contaminated.This is a movie you should watch without looking at any reviews or the synopsis on the box a DVD comes in that tells you what it is all about. Half the fun here is not knowing and finding out things when Lincoln Six-Echo (McGregor) does.Yes, it is a fantasy, but keep in mind a fantasy is something that could happen. Lincoln Six-Echo begins to question why he is kept there so long doing the same thing day after day when others who haven't been there as long win the lottery and go to the Island. Oh, these questions, questions, questions.Anyway, Lincoln hooks up with Jordan Two-Delta (Johansson) and they go on the run trying to get away from their safe environment. Come on, at least you knew that was coming.The stunts are stunts you have not ever, ever, ever seen in a movie. They are fantastic and will blow your mind as you ask yourself, 'How did they do that? OMG! How did they do that?' We have a new director in the house and it seems he will do things others won't do. Good show. What is next Michael Bay?The acting, while not Oscar material, is very good all around. Scarlett Johansson is so beautiful who cares what the story is about anyway? Just watching her is worth the price of admission or the DVD or the rental. Whatever.This is Science Fiction at its best.",9,5,9,22 December 2005
