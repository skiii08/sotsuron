Ford v Ferrari," Incredible and thrilling racing drama
","Ford v Ferrari is an incredible and thrilling racing drama and in my opinion, one of the best films of the year. Christian Bale and Matt Damon both give incredible performances and they have perfect chemistry, although Christian Bale does steal every scene he is in. Jon Bernthal and Tracy Letts are both great. The pacing is incredible as it does not feel as long as it is. The music by Marco Beltrami and Buck Sanders is amazing. James Mangold's direction is fantastic and the film is extremely well filmed, resulting in genuinely thrilling racing sequences throughout. It's also surprisingly very funny in certain parts and emotional in others.",10,12,28,15 November 2019
Insidious: Chapter 2," A disappointing sequel
","Insidious: Chapter 2 is a disappointing sequel that's nowhere near as scary as the original.

National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Really good sequel
","Due to it's plot being very similar to the first National Treasure, it isn't as good as the first but National Treasure: Book of Secrets is still a really good sequel. It's consistently funny with plenty of action. Nicolas Cage, Jon Voight, Diane Kruger and Justin Bartha once again give great performances and newcomers Ed Harris and Helen Mirren are also really good. Jon Turtetaub's direction is great and the film is well paced and also has a great score by Trevor Rabin.",7,2,2,22 July 2019

The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Average set-up
","The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 is a huge step down in quality compared to it's predecessors. The film is nothing more than dull set-up for the next one.

The film is well made and the CG is good.",5,0,0,2 January 2019
Alien 3," Terrible sequel
","Alien 3 is a terrible sequel, a bleak, boring and needlessly nihilistic film that's easily the worst installment in the franchise. David Fincher's direction is extremely misguided. It fails to be scary or suspenseful throughout and the visual effects somehow manage to look worse than it's predecessors. However, Sigourney Weaver is reliably great but the rest of the cast are forgettable.",3,1,2,24 May 2020
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A disappointing start to the prequel trilogy but still good
","Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace is unfortunately a disappointing start to the prequel trilogy but it's still good. It's got some weak CG, pacing issues and wastes a unique villain.

The humour works and the action is thrilling, especially a sequence on/outside air force one. The twist is smart and funny however the villain is one of the more forgettable Marvel villians. Overall Shane Black was a great choice to make this sequel.",9,2,3,31 March 2019
The Ring," Dull horror
","Despite a really good performance from Naomi Watts and good direction from Gore Verbinski, The Ring is a surprisingly dull horror.

Hereditary," Disappointingly bad horror
","Hereditary is unfortunately a disappointingly bad horror. Toni Collette gives an incredible performance and Ari Aster's direction is also incredible, resulting in a beautifully filmed movie.

The only negative is how they explain how Nick Fury loses his eye.",9,2,5,8 March 2019

Roland Emmerich's direction is great and the special effects are amazing. The film also has a really good balance between action/spectacle, emotion and humour. It also has one of the greatest speeches in movie history.",10,0,1,28 December 2018
Legends of the Fall," Great drama
","Legends of the Fall is a great drama that has a huge scope and is both epic and emotional but is a little too melodramatic in places. Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins and Aidan Quinn all give great performances. It's beautifully filmed with great direction from Edward Zwick. The music by James Horner is fantastic.",8,3,4,9 September 2019
Mamma Mia!," A bad musical
","Despite an incredible cast and an amazing soundtrack, Mamma Mia is a bad musical. The incredible cast unfortunately are terrible at singing the songs and the film looks cheap.

Toy Story 4," Incredible and emotional
","Toy Story 4 is incredible and an unexpected but definitely welcome continuation and conclusion of the franchise. It's emotional, fast paced and very funny throughout with incredible animation. Tom Hanks, Annie Potts and Tim Allen give incredible performances once again. Tony Hale, Keanu Reeves, Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele are all great and welcome additions to the cast. The music by Randy Newman is perfect.",10,85,161,21 June 2019
The Favourite," Unusual period drama
","The Favourite had incredible performances from Olivia Colman, Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz. It's beautifully filmed with great dialogue that's smart and funny. But it's brought down by the repetitive and annoying musical score and an ending that somehow feels abrupt and overly long at the same time.",7,3,5,6 January 2019
28 Days Later...," Great zombie movie
","Despite some choppy editing in the more action heavy sequences, 28 Days Later is a great zombie movie with genuine emotion throughout due to great performances from Cillian Murphy, Christopher Eccleston, Naomie Harris and Brendan Gleeson. It also has strong direction from Danny Boyle and a good pace with a great ending.",8,2,3,11 March 2019
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Really good sequel
","It's nowhere near as awe inspiring or innovative as the original, and it's too long (should've ended when they get off the island) but The Lost World: Jurassic Park is still a really good sequel.

The music by Alan Silvestri is incredible. The CG and action is phenomenal and undoubtedly some of Marvel's best. Surprisingly, Thanos has a really good amount of depth and Josh Brolin gives an incredible performance. All the Avengers are great but Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Hemsworth give the standout performances. The script is amazing, both bold and unpredictable.",10,1,3,18 December 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Really good but not as good previous Tarantino movies
","Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood is a really good movie but not as good as previous Tarantino movies. It has no plot and all of the scenes with Sharon Tate could and should be removed. Tarantino's foot fetish is at its most uncomfortable. However, Tarantino's direction is fantastic and the film is visually stunning, feeling authentic to the time period it is set in. Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt both give incredible performances and have amazing chemistry. Margot Robbie gives a really good performance, mostly relying on non verbal communication. The majority of the attempts at humour are actually funny and the soundtrack is reliably great. The extremely violent finale is incredibly fun.",7,3,8,27 August 2019
Aladdin," Surprisingly great live action remake
","Aladdin is a surprisingly great live action remake thats extremely fun. Mena Massoud and Naomi Scott give great performances and Will Smith is surprisingly fantastic and really funny as the genie. The CG is incredible, it's extremely colourful and Guy Richtie's direction works really well. The songs are all incredible once again and the new song is a great addition. However Jafar isn't as good in this as he is in the original.",9,2,8,28 May 2019
Insidious," Incredible low budget horror
","The set up is familiar but Insidious is still an incredible low budget horror. Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrne and Lin Shaye all give great performances.

The unique horror world is well explored and the humour works.",9,0,0,28 December 2018
X-Men: The Last Stand," A disappointing but still enjoyable end to the trilogy
","X-Men: The Last Stand is a disappointing end to the trilogy but it's still enjoyable. It has too many plots in too little time and the phoenix storyline feels extremely rushed and the some characters are wasted. However, the action sequences are well filmed and enjoyable to watch. Brett Ratner's direction is really good and Hugh Jackman's performance is perfect as usual. Ian McKellen, Kelsey Grammer and Halle Berry are also great.",6,1,2,22 December 2018
The Lion King," Average but enjoyable remake
","The Lion King is a mostly faithful remake with incredibly realistic cg and decent performances from an excellent cast, making it a watchable and enjoyable remake. However, everything this movie does well has already been done in a better movie, so can't really give this film the credit. The new scenes that are added don't really work and feel like they are there to pad out the run time. There are also really good and important scenes removed that shouldn't have been, especially as it's trying to be a very faithful remake. Hans Zimmer's score is great but it's the same score, so it was already great in the original Lion King.",5,1,2,20 July 2019
A Quiet Place," A tense and unique horror movie

There's also an extremely thrilling bike chase in the third act that's fantastic.",8,2,2,19 November 2019
X-Men: Apocalypse," Step down from Days of Future Past but still great
","X-Men: Apocalypse is a step down from the previous installment (Days of Future Past) but still great.

The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Not a complete movie but still good

Transformers," A great start to the franchise
","Transformers is great start to the franchise with a sense of wonder and awe and a good balance of humour and spectacle. Sam Witwicky is a likeable human protagonist played excellently by Shia LaBeouf and John Turturro and Josh Duhamel are both really good. The CG is phenomenal and the Transformers designs are great. Peter Cullen is reliably perfect as Optimus Prime. Michael Bay's direction is incredible, resulting in some amazingly filmed and intense action sequences. The composed score by Steve Jablonsky is also incredible.",10,2,2,20 December 2018
1917," Incredibly immersive war movie

Benedict Cumberbatch, Colin Firth, Andrew Scott and Richard Madden all give brief but effective performances. It's extremely well paced, consistently extremely engaging throughout. Sam Mendes' direction and Roger Deakins' cinematography is incredible, crafting a film that seamlessly appears as if
it's one continuous take. The music by Thomas Newman is excellent.",10,13,20,11 January 2020
Event Horizon," Disappointing sci-fi horror
","Event Horizon has a good setup but it's unfortunately a disappointing sci-fi horror. Most of the characters have no depth and it's almost entirely reliant on jump scares. The cg is awful and the ending is abrupt. It's also very derivative. However, it still has some positives, the music by Michael Kamen is really good and Sam Neill and Laurence Fishburne give good performances despite their one dimensional characters. The set design and practical effects are impressive but are also extremely derivative of Alien.",4,2,6,15 August 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Incredibly bold sequel
","Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi is an incredibly bold sequel that delivers a Star Wars film that's bold, thrilling and unpredictable, subverting expectations in extremely enjoyable ways.

Rian Johnson's direction is incredible, staging thrilling action sequences and one of the best lightsaber fights of all time.

Midsommar," Incredibly disturbing horror
","Midsommar is an incredibly disturbing horror that, is in my opinion, a huge improvement over Ari Aster's previous film Hereditary. Florence Pugh gives an incredible lead performance. Jack Reynor and William Jackson Harper both give great supporting performances as well as Will Poulter, who is very funny. It's visually stunning and beautifully filmed with excellent direction from Ari Aster. It's expertly paced with an uncomfortable sense of unease that effectively builds throughout. The music by Bobby Krlic is fantastic. It's only brought down by one scene that is very uncomfortable and distribing for the most part but briefly becomes unintentionally funny.",9,1,3,30 October 2019

Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Nowhere near as good as the first
","Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is nowhere near as good as the first but still an enjoyable sequel. The plot is dumb and ridiculously convoluted and some of the new human characters are pointless. The attempts at humour are awful and it focuses way too much on the human characters. However Shia LaBeouf is still really good and the third act is as ridiculously action packed as you expect from Michael Bay.

All of the adult losers give great performances and have amazing chemistry with Bill Hader giving the standout performance. It's surprisingly extremely funny throughout. Andy Muschietti's direction is great and the music by Benjamin Wallfisch is fantastic. However, what brings it down and makes it slightly disappointing is that it isn't that scary.
