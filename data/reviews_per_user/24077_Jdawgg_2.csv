Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," This movie doesn't deserve the bad reviews.
","First off, this movie was excellent. In no way does it deserve the bad reviews that so many people have given it.  All the acting is top notch, the special effects are the best I have ever seen, and the battle scenes are incredible. One drawback of this movie is Jar Jar Binks, he is quite annoying.  The light sabre fighting scene between Obi Wan and Qui Gon against Darth Maul is awesome.  Overall I give this movie a 9.5 out of 10, deducting 0.5 because of Jar Jar Binks. On a side note I would like to say that I think its great that George Lucas stayed with tradition at the beginning with the scrawling words and the galaxy far far away bit.",10,0,0,21 May 1999
American History X," I was amazed...
","Before viewing this film I had heard nothing but positive remarks about it. A few friends had spoken highly of it so I figured I would give it a whirl. This is easily one of my favorite movies after viewing it only once.  I didnt expect the film to be so moving or well done.  Once again Edward Norton was excellent, kudos.  If you havent seen this movie, then you should.  If you have seen this movie, see it again.  It really was that good. Peace.",10,0,0,23 February 2000
