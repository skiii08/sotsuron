The Longest Yard," Funny and Good Movie
","This is a good movie better then the original. More over it has a decently good cast. Is better then 'Mean Machine' (2001) which is the soccer version of 'The Longest Yard', but over all a good movie. In my opinion the funniest part in the movie (the 2005) version that is, is when when they are in the basement looking at the wardens 'prone to violence' rating system and they see that Caretakers rating is half a star and then Skitchy make a comment about the purposed 'pillow fight' between Crew and Caretaker, he says some thing along the lines of ' yeah we can call is Superstar versus half a star'. Anyhoo, I hope you enjoy this movie because I did.",9,1,4,13 April 2006
