United 93," These passengers are heroes.
","Unfortunately my English is very poor. Minimum ten lines based in fragments of English language is very hard for me. Even so, I go to try to explain my opinion. I watched United 93 in a movie theater near Paris in France. I liked this film. We can't forget this : this hijacked plane was destined to hit the White House, neither more nor less the heart of USA. Three other hijacked planes reached their targets : WTC and Pentagon. The reaction of the passengers from United 93 against the terrorists, prevented the complete disaster. These passengers are heroes!After the end of the movie, the people present in the room stay in complete silence. No moves, no sounds! Complete silence. It's impressive.A great movie. A simple, but great movie. A movie in honor to the victims from the tragic 9/11 and these courageous passengers. A movie to remember. There are my sentiments. I apologize for my grammatical mistakes on this message.",10,11,22,31 July 2006
