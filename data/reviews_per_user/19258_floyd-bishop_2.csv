Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Dwindling Returns
","The 'POTC' franchise is slowly sinking. Although Cap'n Jack Sparrow and Barbosa were great, they couldn't carry the movie by themselves. Too many of the dynamic characters were missing and the choice of Penelope Cruz as the femme fatale was a disastrous decision; she lacks in every way and comparing her to Keira Knightley is like comparing a kitten fart to a hurricane. I have hope that there will be, at least, one more episode in which Rob Marshall realizes his 'error', loses Cruz (hopefully by killing her at the beginning of the next movie) and reunites the original cast. Once in a great while, there is perfect chemistry between actors, a terrific plot and incredible effects that enters your living room and takes you to where they are.' Pirates...' did that for us until now.",6,1,1,29 March 2012
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Not up to par with the others. . .
","The original 'Transformers' movie was not bad, but this sequel is quite simply one of the worst movies ever made.Don't get me wrong, I love cheesy summer block buster movies. I love huge CGI over the top nonsense. I like pretty much most movies, simply because someone took the time and effort to make them. I even like the first two installments of this series. There is a very short list though, of movies I loathe, detest, despise. Eyes Wide Shut. 300. Pan's Labyrinth. And now I must add Transformers: Dark of the Moon. Both Peter Travers and Roger Ebert describe the movie perfectly, and give the appropriate zero stars; so a review here is unnecessary. This is for anyone thinking they might go see this horrible waste of film- donate the money to charity. Starving children in Africa deserve your money more than Michael Bay.",2,2,6,29 March 2012
