The Longest Yard," Stop the REMAKES
","Please Hollywood stop the remakes. Your not good at them. This is another example of a classic Hollywood movie ruined by the New Hollywood & actors who can't pull it off. I like Adam Sandler but would like to see him in better scripted movies. Adam aren't you tired of playing the same roll over & over? The script was bad, the dialog even worse. Chris Rock needs to either get acting lessons or stay out of cinema. He's never been able to carry a movie & the chemistry between he & Sandler doesn't exist. There were very few actual laughs just goofy comedy & scenes already played on television. Don't' waste your money.",1,4,8,3 June 2005
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Better than King Kong
","This movie was amazing. I recommend this to anyone. The story takes place around the time of WWII. Showing the Germans bombing of England. Parent heartbreakingly having to send their children into the country to keep them safe. The scene at the train station was done very well. I heard many of the women weeping in the audience. The children arriving in the country really showed the difference between the bombed out imagery & the quiet countryside. Very well done. The imagery in Narnia was breathtaking, the acting was superb & the plot made sense. My family saw this & King Kong. We all decided unanimously that this was a much better film. The little girl was spectacular. Her eyes were so expressive many times they told the story. The Queen was evil but beautiful a perfect casting. Azlan really took your breath away. The detail on all the animals was done to such detail you weren't sure which was really & which were not. I would not miss this beautifully done drama. Take your family & watch with amazement.",9,0,2,23 December 2005
The Notebook," Greatest Love Story I've Ever Seen
","This movie was unbelievable. From beginning to end the writing was superb. The acting was tremendous - James Garner should get an Oscar for his performance. The idea of a patient in a nursing home reading a story to another was brilliant. Jame Garner role as the narrator made the movie. He made the love story between Noah & Allie even more believable. His performance during the scene when the doctor was sedating Gena is nothing short of heart pulling. It took every once of energy from me. Even my 15 year old daughter was misty eyed. If the Academy Award committee misses this one, they are truly blind. I loved the script, the acting & the direction. Please go see this movie - you definitely will not regret the decision.",10,0,0,10 July 2004
Dreamgirls," Move over Beyonce', here comes Jennifer Hudson
","I never thought I'd ever see someone that could push Beyonce' to the back of the room with singing. Jennifer Hudson blew Beyonce' out of the water. Her performance was breath-taking. Where has this girl been hiding? I understand she was passed over in American Idol. Simon Cowel?, you should be hiding your head. Whoever made the mistake on this one - shouldn't have a job anymore. This girls performance was magnificent. If the Academy doesn't nominate her - they should all be retired. The whole cast of this movie was good. The musical numbers were outstanding. Eddie Murphy outdid himself. He was funny & dramatic as James Thunder Early, James Brown character. The musical numbers were very good- they were done with feeling & made you feel good. Jennifer Hudson's solo staying goodbye to her lover & friends was moving - she brought tears to my eyes. I hope to see this girl move onto Broadway - she would pack the house. Go see this movie.",8,0,3,27 December 2006
The Illusionist," Great film - highly recommended
","I didn't know what to expect going into this film mainly because I'd heard virtually nothing about it. I am an Edward Norton & Paul Giamatti fan so thought I'd give it a whirl. I was very pleased that I did. This film was very well done. I loved the cinematic scenery, the filming was done to make you feel as if you were there. The colors were subdued & bright when the audience was viewing the court scenes. Paul Giamatti was brilliant as the Chief Inspector. You could tell from his performance that he was torn between his duty & the truth. Edward Norton, as ever, was also brilliant. His performance was powerful & breathtakingly real. Watching his do his sorcery was almost frightening. I could feel why the audience was aghast. The imagery throughout the film kep your attention. The countryside was beautiful. Jennifer Beals did an adequate job as the Duchess. However I couldn't wait to see more of Edward Norton or Paul Giamatti. I don't want to spoil any of the performances in this wonderful masterpiece. I only hope the Academy remembers these two men when handing down their nominations.",9,4,6,11 September 2006
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Question the Critics
","I'm sorry I went into this film thinking that I would love it like all the critics views I read. However, this was one of the worse movies I think I've ever witnessed. It was boring & so over the top, I just couldn't get into it. Johnny Depp as always was good but the voice he used for Willy Wonka was irritating. It was to the point that at the end of the film I wanted to reach in & choke Willy Wonka just so I wouldn't have to hear the voice anymore. The coloring didn't make any sense either, he was always either green, blue or pale colored. Depended upon what scene he was in. He just looked sickly. He had absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever. I didn't see the need for the incredibly stupid flashbacks to his childhood. It made no sense in the picture & was irritating. The Umpahs were OK... I didn't like the singing because most the time we couldn't understand what they were singing about. I thought the kids were fairly good. I really liked this kid who played Charlie much better than the original... he was good. I've always been a fan of Tim Burton but I know he's done much better.",1,21,39,10 October 2005
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," My advise: spend your money elsewhere
",I'm tired of reading so called 'professional' critics saying a movie is great & then going to see it & finding they stink. Who is paying these critics? Definitely not the newspapers they work for.I went to this film thinking 'I love Will Ferrell' It has to be funny. Boy was I wrong. From beginning to end it was painful. The script was no where near the talent Will is capable of producing. The jokes were anything but. The acting was okay but a little over the top. I was really looking forward to this & was very disappointed. The only redeeming parts of the film were the dog & the cameos.Don't waste your money.,2,2,5,10 July 2004
Cinderella Man," One of the greater boxing movies! Please don't miss it.
",Russel Crowe was outstanding. He really brought this character to life. The visual look at how far this family fell during the depression was incredible. We today have no idea what our parents & grandparents went through. Ron Howard really brought this to home with the lines outside the shipyards & the lines waiting to get go on the dole. Excellent job! The only thing I was disappointed in was Renee. She looked a bit too Roxie Heart to me. In the beginning that was all I could see & hear. She made me think of that character. I did think however that she & Russell have good chemistry together. I however was more focused on his character throughout the film. I also was impressed with the kids. They did a great job playing off the parents. I believe Russell as the parent more than Renee.I also was very impressed with Paul Giamatti's character. He played the rich hustler/promoter very well. It was a shock to find that he was essentially as poor as the Braddocks. You could tell he really believed in Braddock.Bruce McGill was very compelling as the rich promoter. He played the jerk very well.My favorite part in the film was when Braddock went to Johnston & the rest of the rich promoters begging for money to put the electricity back on. It really showed the lack of empathy on the part of the people who had against the people who didn't.The only other part I was unsure of was the Max Baer character. Was he really so brash & mean? I kind of looked at this as the way boxers are. Look at the way Mahommad Ali & Mike Tyson have acted when trying to promote fights.Good film - great fight - great suspense.....,9,0,0,29 June 2005
