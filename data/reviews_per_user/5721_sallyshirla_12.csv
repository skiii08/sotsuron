The Mask," Mysteriously fun
",Jim Carey and the director deliver once again. It's an unusual comedic superhero film and a cult classic.,8,0,0,11 March 2019
Troy," Hmmm
","All the name-actors couldn't put Troy back together again in this over acted, poorly written train wreck.",5,3,7,11 March 2019
L.A. Confidential," One of the best
",We've not come very far since this classic in terms of high quality cop crime dramas. Acting and direction is perfection.,9,9,10,11 March 2019
Pacific Rim," Hmmm- boring
",This film had me flicking through my phone half the time. The pacing is meant to be fast with lots of big CGI action scenes but it just could not keep my interest. The writing is to blame for this one I suspect.,5,1,4,11 March 2019
American History X," Great work
","IT can be simplistic at times, but the messages are powerful in this great Ed Norton film. Hard to believe it's been so long since the film was made. Definitely recommend it to anyone fascinated by how Neo-Nazism could possibly exist in the modern age.",8,6,7,29 September 2018
Kick-Ass," Fun ride
","This film redefined superhero films - making them edgy, gory and funny all at once! Definitely worth seeing if you haven't already as is the sequel.",8,0,0,11 March 2019
Dumb and Dumber," They don't make comedies like this anymore
",A bizarre classic comedy that requires more recognition. Jim Carey is a comedic genius. Reminds me a bit of the 3 stooges,8,2,2,11 March 2019
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Loved it!
",Love this tongue in cheek style of British comedy which isn't usual for me. Fun and charged all the way through albeit very far-fetched coincidental scenarios,8,0,0,11 March 2019
12 Years a Slave," Great acting, slow pace
","I enjoyed the storyline and acting but the film was very slow to get to a point where I was interested. In any case, worth a watch for those who haven't seen!",7,1,2,11 March 2019
The Silence of the Lambs," Chilling
",Hopkins delivers in a challenging role in a film that you're on the edge of your seat the entire time. Some iconic scenes that will keep you up at night!,9,0,0,11 March 2019
Fifty Shades of Grey," Why do films like this keep getting made?
","Seriously - what is the appeal for films like this to be made? So many negative critic and user reviews. There is no romance, drama or admirable traits in the protagonists. It was a painful watch. I'm being generous with the 4/10 because I appreciate the hard work of the crew who work behind the scenes to make an earning.",4,6,9,29 September 2018
Up in the Air," Fun romance
",It was an ok show but the premise was a bit far fetched and that got to me. The acting and George Clooney made it watchable and at times laugh-worthy,6,2,2,11 March 2019
