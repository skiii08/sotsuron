The Lobster," Trainwreck to be avoided at all costs
","The man who stole too much of my time with Dogtooth brings another pretentious, opaque, joyless, obnoxious film that enlists live human actors to play the parts of non-humans who don't act like people, to make a statement about nothing (how can it be about anything if the people live in a world that operates off vapid conceits that don't pertain in the slightest to how live humans actually live), but of course critics laud as genius work. Avoid at all costs.",1,5,6,20 February 2017
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," A flawed classic
","Set nostalgia aside, here are my main criticisms of the film after watching it now as an adult: <ul><li>Princess Leia is a non entity in this film. She shoots her gun a couple times, but for the most part she is the object of Luke and Han's attraction. Like one of the biggest characters in the entire series does nothing for an entire film.</li></ul><ul><li>Mark Hamill really could've taken some acting lessons before taking Jedi training with Yoda. When Vader says 'Luke I am your father' Mark's reaction to it is hilariously cheesy and bad. I lol'd. Also - the yoda training scenes, so many unintentionally funny moments.</li></ul><ul><li>There were lots of times in the plot where I had no clue why anyone was doing what they were doing. Couldn't figure out the motivations for large chunks of the film. Like why don't the fliers go out in their planes to get Luke when he was out in the snow? And instead they let Han Solo do it? They are valuable assets to the rebels and would likely freeze to death. Why doesn't Vader just go to the Yoda planet and find Luke there? Or Kill Yoda? Jedi problem over.</li></ul>Anyway, the film is beautiful. Technically I'm sure it was innovative for its time. Sure parts are a bit dated, but I like the journey it takes. It's a classic and I have deep respect for the filmmakers. Just think it should be seen more as an achievement of its time instead of a timeless classic.",5,1,4,18 January 2017
Warcraft," I want to hate it, but...
","It's totally an all-over-the-place mess. The CGI is strange. The plot makes no sense. A lot of the actors are miscast. I can go on about the film's negatives, however somehow I enjoyed watching it. I saw it on a late night screening and it held my attention, was fun, something was always happening. I can't comment on the characters' inner drama, or the Orc/Human battle, or anything like that, but I can say that despite the film having zero to say about anything, it was a fun watch and a good way to spend a mindless couple hours seeing things blow up and turn green. Bonus points for Travis Fimmel being able to keep it going. He's a fun actor to watch, and I hope I see him in more stuff. Besides that, what did I just watch?",6,1,3,26 June 2016
