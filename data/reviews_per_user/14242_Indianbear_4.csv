3:10 to Yuma," Nothing to 'Crowe' about here.
","Where's Glenn Ford when you need him? Man, this film is a stinker.I fault myself for going to see this picture. I should have known better, but I'm a sucker for westerns; always have been. I keep hoping Hollywood will actually turn out another good one. Yea, right. Like they'll finally come to their senses and make a horse opera to equal Red River, The Man From Laramie, Shane, or Hondo.I'm sure that most people who read reviews of this bust-out flick will read many more reviews than this one, so I'll leave it to the other honest reviewers to point out the many flaws in the story line and just plain insults to the intelligence of the audience.Hollywood really needs to get over itself, and that surely includes Russell Crowe. He wastes a lot of time promoting the politically correct Hollywood agenda of trying to make bad guys look like good guys and good guys look like bad guys.Crowe's gun is called 'The Hand of God' and has a Crucifix on the handle. Yes Catholics, a Crucifix not just a cross. You're treated to a long camera shot of the handle just to make sure you get it.He quotes scripture like he was vomiting curse words, he verbally spits on Christianity and Christians in general and makes sure that Jesus gets the 'Hollywood Required' dose of ridicule. What cowardly tripe. The Duke would eat this guy for lunch.The ending of the film is absolutely unbelievable. There was no satisfactory wrap up, just a complete unraveling of any pretense of a sensible story line.P. T. Barnum was right. I sure felt like a sucker after wasting my time on this one.Suffice to say that the best thing you could do is rent a copy of the original, take it home, pop some Redenbacher's and enjoy watching a real western.",1,16,31,22 October 2007
Million Dollar Baby," It's not about life, it's about death.
","Clint Eastwood has been (in past years) a favorite of mine. I've enjoyed his westerns and many other films he's starred in.When it comes to this film I'm reminded of the old saying 'You can fool some of the people all of the time, you can fool all of the people some of the time, but you can't fool all of the people all of the time.'Well, judging from the percentage of positive reviews, both on this site and in the newspapers, Clint has indeed come pretty close to 'fooling all of the people all of the time' with this one.The first two thirds of Million Dollar Baby is indeed a great fight film. It's uplifting and satisfying in every sense of the word. If Clint had stopped there I would also have been writing a review that drips with honey, as so many of my peers have done.But he doesn't stop there. He glues a lengthy stretch of additional celluloid onto a great fight film to promote his personal belief in euthanasia. He sells, and sells hard, the idea that killing Maggie is a good, kind, and loving act. After all, who wants to live as a paraplegic? I wonder what the late Christopher Reeves would have said about this had he seen the film? I rather think the good Mr. Reeves would have spit in Clint's eye.When it comes out on DVD be sure and show this film to every crippled person you know. In particular the paraplegics who 'fight the good fight' every day. It will cheer them right up.If it were only a boxing film I would rate it 10 stars, it's terrific. But as it's really an 'ambush' film promoting Clint's personal belief in euthanasia, I give it no stars at all.",Null,0,3,1 March 2005
The Da Vinci Code," DaVinci is NOT Da Bomb --- it's just a wet firecracker.
","It has been said that when God created man, he put definite limits on his intelligence but no limits on his stupidity.Dan Brown with both his book and now this flaccid excuse for a movie has certainly proved that to be correct.He's got to be laughing his rear end off at all of us; all the way to the bank.Here's a guy who wrote a novel (if you can call that collection of mangled sentences a novel) that did little more than express his distorted personal views of a God he doesn't believe in and his distaste for people who do believe.Take Adolph Hitler's hatred of Jews in 'Mein Kampf,' add a weak story line and call it a novel and you'll have what Dan Brown did with his hatred of Jesus Christ, the Bible, Christians in general and Catholics in particular in 'The DaVinci Code.' I'll give him credit for one thing though; he's a master of the BIG LIE.He seems to fully understand that the bigger and more outrageous a lie is, the easier it is to get people to fall for it. P. T. Barnum understood that and made a career out of telling big lies in a humorous way. It worked. The public was entertained and he got rich in the process.By comparison, Dan Brown's big lies are neither humorous nor entertaining, they're just lies; period.Regarding those who have the audacity to protest against Dan's lies, (like the people that were standing across the street from the movie theater holding signs) the DaVinci disciples are fond of saying 'Hey, get a grip. It's just FICTION!' As if that makes it all OK. With that kind of thinking you can then tell any lie you want about anyone you want; call it fiction, and you can get away with it -- right?Try this one on for size. Someone writes a novel about your family; your mother, father etc. and all the people you love and respect. In the novel your family members and all your friends are called whores, liars, thieves, and murders. When you protest, you're told 'Get a grip!! It's just FICTION!' I wonder if you would accept it as such; ya think? Yea, I know. The book was a mildly interesting murder mystery. If that had been translated to the screen, perhaps it could have been given at least two stars for entertainment value. Not so.This flick is so dull you'll need a six pack of 'Jolt' just to stay awake. People in the audience actually snickered at some of the supposedly most serious and dramatic moments in the film.I really can't give it much of a review at all; it was just too over hyped, too long, too weak and too dull to even deserve commenting on.I can't grace this slug of a film with anything more than one star. I guess Ron and Tom needed the money. If you value yours, stay home and watch a rerun of 'Shoes of the Fisherman.' It inspires something a lot more productive than Dan's hokum does; that fer sure.What's next? Maybe Dan will follow this up with a novel about Mother Theresa of Calcutta. Yea, 'The Calcutta Code.' In it he'll give us the inside scoop on how Mother Theresa was actually a conspirator and together with today's descendants of DaVinci she was really planning to take over the world. All that business of helping the poor for over forty years was just a cover up. Like Dan, Ron and Tom will laugh all the way to the bank. Why? Because almost no one will pay any attention to the negative (but honest) reviews of this dog and they'll still cough up their bucks at the box office window. This overflowing hog trough will probably be nominated for six or seven academy awards. Sigh. Go figure.",1,10,21,22 May 2006
The Happening," An 'elephant' of a film.
","Remember the story of the four blind men? They were walking down a road and encountered an elephant. They had never come across one before.A passer by told them they were standing by an elephant. The first blind man walked forward, ran into the side of the elephant, and said; 'an elephant is like a wall.' The second blind man walked forward and came to the elephant's leg. Putting his arms around the elephants leg he said; 'an elephant is like a tree.' The third one took hold of the animals trunk and said; 'an elephant is like a snake.' The last grabbed the creatures tail and said; 'an elephant is like a rope.' Of such varied opinions, depending on your perspective, is the film 'The Happening.' I've read a lot of different views about the film, and, yes, it appears that I have a very different perspective.First, and this is not directly about the film itself, I do not think graphic portrayals of suicide are 'entertaining.' I don't buy the ever increasing representation of so called 'realism' that today's film makers seem to think is vital to what they are trying to communicate.We've reached the point in our society where we can sit in darkened theaters eating popcorn, drinking Coke, and chug it all down while we're watching absolutely realistic portrayals of the most gruesome and downright sick representations of self inflicted death that you can possibly imagine.This is our version of 'feeding the Christians to the lions.' I imagine the ancient Romans were also enjoying their snacks while they watched people being eaten alive by animals, burned alive etc. and indeed they also called it 'entertainment.' Just because we're doing it with special effects does not make us 'better' than they were. What we're doing is just as much a sign of sickness, and is just as dangerous as what is portrayed in 'The Happening.' Our sickness is also self destructive. History has proved that; we're just not paying attention.Regarding the movie, I honestly think that the story line itself had the same overall quality as Hitchcock's 'The Birds.' It they had underplayed the deaths, instead of throwing them in our faces with hot 'air sick bag' graphic portrayals, it's possible they could have had a truly classic 'fright film' with as one reviewer stated, the atmosphere of a 'Twilight Zone' episode. Alas, it was not to be.I'm sorry to say they missed their chance to have this film placed on the same shelf as Alfred's. Hitchcock's film will never be forgotten; this one will.",6,1,5,16 July 2008
