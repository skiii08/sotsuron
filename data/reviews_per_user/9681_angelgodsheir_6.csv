Resident Evil: Afterlife," Potentially good
","This is a movie about zombies so don't't expect to watch heart breaking performance or life changing sorties. That being said this movie is based on the video games saga of the same name and many fans including myself expect to see that and being this the fourth installment we already know that's not what is going to happen. In the games AL was about terror, fear of what may be around the corner and be ruining out of bullets, in the movies (exept the first may be) this is completely lacking, they shoot like they own a bullets factory and is completely more action oriented than fear driving. Elements of the game are thrown in without even bothering to explain why or how. What makes this movie a disaster is also what makes it great, I mean is pure action from beginning to end and despite the fact that the character of Alice never existed in the games she is just adorable played by Milla Jovovich. I think there are a lot of potential in this saga if would change of director's hands but still makes it for a nice way to spent an hour and a half eating popcorn.",6,1,3,3 October 2012
Batman Begins," Perfect!
","Batman Beggins is one of the best movies of all time by one of the best directors of all time. I don't wanna sound like fan boy here but after watching this movie for the thousand time I still don't find anything wrong with it. The script is just excellent, all the story points are masterfully driven; Cristhian Bale outdone himself, you really can see him suffering and struggling to overcome his fears. Caine lift the emotional side of the story as well as Oldman gives all his talent to make this a really Detective comic (DC). Neeson is really terrifying cause you can see that he will have no hesitations to blow your brains. The camera-work is outstanding and the music of Hans Zimmer is truly worthy of recognition. Finnally I applaud Nolan for making what could have been another cheesy comic book movie a truly master piece that would be admired for ages to come.",10,0,1,18 September 2012
Blood Diamond," A master piece
","Once in a while comes along a movie that you can describe in one word: perfect. This movie revolves around a diamond smuggler, a father that has lost his family and a journalist all caught in the middle of a civil war zone. Dicaprio gives once of his best performance in this movie, you can really feel how he despise his tough attitude is a good man inside and Jennifer show us how we can ignore the bad things and how even if we care about them there's really nothing we can do. This movie has a lot of violence but they achieve that without making this a gore films, you can see the desperation in the peoples eyes and the bad guys are really scary, with its more than two hours your fell you don't want it to end. A masterpiece.",9,3,4,17 September 2012
Prometheus," A must watch.
","Promethus is one of the most beautifully shot movies I've ever seen. The first minutes at the theater Iwas just in awe at the visuals and then we are introduced to the plot witch really manage to get our attention. The way Scott is able to build up the tension is truly the work of a master of his art. The too is great, Rapace is a great leading actress and Fassbender deserves an Oscar for his interpretation of a robot. The music is great too and the only reason I don't give this a 10 is because there are some plot wholes in the script. I mean there are some seriously wrong things in the story line and in the way the characters react and interact but apart from that this is definitely a must watch.",9,1,4,23 September 2012
Moonrise Kingdom," Superb
","This is definitely one of the best movies I've seen this year so far. This movie is about two special kids that fall in love and decide to run away. When the movie starts we are introduced by the narrator to the place where all this happens and get to know some of the characters. Story wise the writer / director really managed to get everything told from the point of view of a teen, showing us only what they can understand and transmitting us the emotions they can feel. The performance of the two leads are superb and it is even more so because they never acted before! The supporting cast is composed of a number of great starts that have already probed their talent and this is no exception. The music really managed to transport us to a magic place and the visuals make us never want to leave. Besides all that witch was excellent what really shocked me was the camera work, I haven't seen something like it since the days of Kubrik. This is definitely Anderson's best and I hope it will land him some Oscar nominations and who knows even the statue.",10,1,3,24 September 2012
V for Vendetta," A classic
","This is one of the greatest movies of this century for a number of reasons, for starting the plot was superb, how pain can lead to vengeance without losing the mind and intelligence and how fear can lead societies to change their freedoms for security witch are topics in every day life day in some countries, are perfectly depicted and the director know what he is talking about and how to talk about it. The acting too was something marvelous, Weaving who never shows his face still managed to transmit real feeling trough his voice and movements. The performance given by Portman I think should have earned her an Oscar nomination and the rest of the cast were good as well. This movie I will see a hundred times more and never get tired of it.",10,1,3,25 September 2012
