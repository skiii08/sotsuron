The Lobster," Life is too short to see this
","This is, by far, the worst movie I've seen this century. I wanted to turn it off after 20 mins but son & hubs wanted to see more. They wanted to turn it off half way through and I regret not supporting that notion at that point. Positively miserable movie with an absolutely stupid, abrupt ending. We use the rating of exclusively to select movies and why this is rated 7+ is totally misguided.",1,1,4,4 April 2020
"I Love You, Man"," Seriously, a 7.2
","Watched this movie this evening. It is seriously over-rated. There are so many better movies of better quality than this. Everyone in the film, I believe, used the 'F' word at least once, which is very unrealistic for professionals in the business setting... or should be. Everyone. including the 90+ year old man and the young professional women, had a foul mouth, talking vulgar about the couple's sex life. Could have been a much better movie if it was cleaned up... a lot. I was highly disappointed. Don't waste your time unless you have nothing better to do and don't mind wasting the time out of your life. I am not a better person for watching this, not a happier person; just feel robbed of my evening. Wanted to turn it off, and should have, half way through it but thought it would turn around and get better. It really didn't. I realize its suppose to be light and funny but its not all that funny.",3,6,11,2 June 2011
