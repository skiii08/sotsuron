The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," worst movie ever.
","This movie is so bad. It doesn't even deserve 1 star. The script, acting (with the exemption of Anna Kendrick) and just about everything are awful. The movie extras have more talent than the main characters. This is not worth renting nor pirating. The actors are horrible. When Bella was walking down the aisle, I couldn't make out of her expression if not constipated while faking an orgasm... it was so hilarious and I was laughing my ass off her through out the whole movie. The makeup isn't creative at all too. They look more like ghosts than vampires. Their faces are so white and didn't look real at all. I enjoyed watching the Twilight parody, Vampire Sucks more than this. Anyway, I have billions of bad things to say about the movie and not one good. It's not too late yet... the last movie hasn't been released yet. If I were them I would recast and re shoot the last movie.",1,6,7,31 January 2012
