Alien 3," AS BAD AS A SEQUEL CAN BE
",Stupid! Not fun! Not worthy!  This movie is famous for all the wrong reasons!  The studio stared production before the  screenplay was completed! ( NEVER A GOOD IDEA) The movie suffer because story is very weak! In this Ripley crashes on a planet to a prison colony!  Now Ripley is the 'Alien'. Aliens was released in 1986 then Alien 3 was released in 1992. In six years don't you think the studio could of came up with a better movie?  Yes I know this movie has its fans but I for one am not a fan of long boring movies. There is so maney things wrong with this movie I could go on and on! To save time I will just tell you one of them!  We see a fan blade in the background and so the audience knows someone is going to die in that blade! In 2003 FOX released the original cut on DVD of this movie and its just boring as the movie they released in 1992! Also FOX could of saved itself when ALien 4 came out!  They could of have Ripley waking up from the nightmare and thus Alien 3 was just her dream! That way we could of had  all the survivors form 'ALiens' in 'Alien 4'. Yes I know that is too 'Dallas' but Alien 4 wasn't much better than this! Yes David Fincher has gone on to make  'Fight Club' 'Seven' and 'PANIC ROOM' but I think this was his 'student movie' and therefore plays like it!,1,192,203,25 June 2004

The Sound of Music," THE ONE MOVIE THAT EVERYONE SHOULD WATCH
",This is the KING of musicals!  IF you can pick 10 movies to watch for the rest of your life this should be at the top of your list!  This has a musical score that can't be matched!  All the songs are classics! It should be mandatory that everyone should watch this with someone they love If you have kids watch it with them! If you never watched this SHAME ON YOU!! THIS IS MOVIE MAGIC!,10,1,7,7 September 2003
Alien: Resurrection," THEY BLEW IT AGAIN
",Fox went ahead and did this Alien  sequel even after the last movie not much better than 'Plan 9 From Outer Space'.  Don't get me wrong bringing back 'Ripley' from the dead via D.N.A. was a smart idea however they should of had her wake up from a nightmare and then we see that 'alien 3' was her nightmare (as well as the studios nightmare).  If they went ahead with that they could of brought back 'Hicks' 'Newt' and the robot from 'Aliens'.  This movie is a little better than 'Alien 3' but so is  going to the dentist.  As far as future goes for more sequels lets hope they bring in someone that can fix this mess!  At one time Danny Boyle was to direct Alien Resurrection I hope if there is another 'Alien' movie they get him ( he did 28 Days Later) or John Carpenter of 'Halloween' and 'The Thing'.,7,2,3,25 June 2004
Little Miss Sunshine," What a surprise
","The only thing I can say bad about this movie is that I am from California and I could tell the whole movie was shot there! Even the beginning I could tell it was Valencia Area! Now the last part of the movie made me homesick! They filmed it in my hometown of Ventura, CA. If you live in Ventura you know what they made look like the hotel parking lot when it wasn't the hotel at all ..it was the state beach parking lot. But now the review. The movie takes us for a ride! Just when you know where its headed they do something you would not ever dream of! Some ideas of this movie reminded me of other movies (Nine to Five,Vacation) but what they did give us was a great story with a cast of pros. I hope come award time this movie wins everything. Nobody came across as acting!I wanted to see this movie but I had no idea I would love it so much! This is one of the best movies I have watched in years!",9,5,11,27 August 2006
Gone with the Wind," The Legendary Movie that everyone must see
",Don't be fooled by the AFI ranking (#4 please ask everyone else this is #1) this is the best movie Hollywood has ever made period. Yes this is close to 4 hours long but't it is never boring! ( Something todays directors should note). Every frame of this movie is a work of art. This is grand entertainment and once you watch it you will never forget it! In case you don't know the story that is even better! However I recommend this on a rainy afternoon when you can sit by the fireplace and enjoy! Once you see this movie you will want to run out and visit the south! Yes the movie has its critics but every movie does. In my opinion this movie is perfect. If I had one complaint about is that Clark Gable didn't win the Academy Award for this movie. However that year was 1939 and almost all movies that year that were released were way above average. If you enjoy movies about old Hollywood you should see 'The Making a Legend: The Making of Gone With The Wind'.,10,8,15,28 February 2005
Million Dollar Baby," This won the Academy Award and I am glad
",If your not a fan of 'Clint Eastwood' don't worry you will still like this movie! I am one of the few people who hated 'The Unforgiven'. I even hated 'Mystic River' (To Me that was just an all star Law & Order Episode') However this movie is what movie making used to be in the 1970's! This movie is one that will stay with you. The movie doesn't answer questions but dares to ask them instead. This movie is not preachy and shows the struggles of 'Free Will' and dares to ask what is living without even asking outright! Right to lifers will hate this movie! But everyone has to ask 'What is Life'?! Also why should you impose your wishes on someone who has a different view? What makes one right and not the other? Clint Eastwood has brought us some of the best action movies ever made. Now he has made a movie that will make even Mel Gibson mad. What a guy!,10,11,18,28 February 2005
Halloween," HALLOWEEN HAS NEVER BEEN THE SAME
",What Steven Spielberg did for the Ocean and Sharks  John Carpenter did the same thing with Halloween.  Everyone that has seen Steven Spielberg's 'Jaws' WILL ALWAYS HERE THE SCORE FROM 'Jaws' when they put just one toe in the ocean.  Now everyone that has seen the movie 'Halloween' will always think again when this semi-holiday rolls in. 'Halloween' brought a big city nightmare into suburbia.  In this classic motion picture John Carpenter shows us that evil doesn't come from outer space but from the neighbor hood. The story starts off on Halloween Night 1963 with a brutal murder of a 17 year old Judith Myers. We quickly learn that her 6 year old brother killed her. Now 15 years later on Halloween eve he escapes from a hospital and returns to him hometown on Halloween.  As of 2004 the movie spawned 7 sequels. If your new to the Halloween Movies then please note that that 'Halloween 3' is not a sequel to the first two movies. Halloween 4-6 are disregarded altogether when Jamie Lee Curtis came back for Halloween H20!,10,0,1,19 June 2004
The Wizard of Oz," How can you not love this!
",Generations have fallen in love with Judy Garland as soon as they have seen 1 second of this beloved immortal motion picture! We will age this movie will not! This is not just the best family movie ever made it is just one of the all time greats period. This is Judy Garland and MGM at the top of there game! This is one movie that looks even more impressive on the silver screen! If you ever have a chance to see this at the theater it is well worth the money! Now if anyone out there can locate or has the missing footage from this movie ( there is about 10-12 minutes that were cut) you will be one rich person! There were several scenes shorten or cut. The scarecrow song and dance number can bee seen on the DVD release however other footage that was cut was a song and dance number called 'The Jitterbug'. There was also footage of 'Dorothy' singing a verse or two from 'Over the Rainbow' when she is inside the witch's castle. There is also parade footage that was cut when our 4 heroes return from killing the witch. In the 'Kansas' black and white footage there is cut footage as well. Now how about a special edition of this movie with (cgi help) re-created missing footage!,10,3,7,28 February 2005
Dodgeball," FUNNY IT MADE ME LAUGH
","Listen this movie will make you laugh.  Its not great but its entertaining. In this movie a man must save his gym.  He owes $50,0000 or he will lose everything.  Well he and his staff form a 'DODGEBALL' team so they can win $50,000 in a Dodgeball contest.  When the only two 'funny movies: out there is this movie and  'Soul Plane' what a sad comment that is on AMerican Movies.  However this is a fun movie.  Anybody over the age of 12 will know how this will end but thats fine. Anybody under the age of 12 should see 'Thunderbirds'. Please note there is mild violence in this but its for comic effect. Put this way the violence is on par with 'America's Funniest Home Videos'",8,0,0,24 June 2004
