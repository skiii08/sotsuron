Deja Vu," Killer flick
","Red Herring: In the burial scene, a fifth limo driver joins a group of 4 other drivers. Moments later Washington asks whether there were 4 or 5 limo drivers. Kilmer replies that there were 4. This is never mentioned again. So why bring it up in the first pace?I also have problems with the traffic mayhem Doug (Washington) creates in pursuing the terrorist. He causes numerous accidents, some clearly involving injury to other drivers, yet there is no follow-up for actions that could be considered equally heinous to the terrorist bombing, though on a smaller scale.On another note, however, give Denzel props for wearing the Dillard University baseball cap in the opening scenes in tribute to this Historically Black University in New Orleans, as he promised Dillard students he would when he visited the temporary campus in the New Orleans Hilton Riverside Hotel during filming last spring.",9,0,1,29 December 2006
