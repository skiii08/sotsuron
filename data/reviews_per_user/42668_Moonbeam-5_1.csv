The Blair Witch Project," Real scare factor, without the Hollywood.
","I was very privleged to see this movie in it's limited release. I wasn't quite sure what to expect since I hadn't heard much about it. This movie was awesome. It was so different from every other movie nowadays. Shot on a Super-8 camera, the picture is smaller and almost square. It also alternates between black and white and color. But anyway it appears to be very very real. Unfortunately for the filmmakers, the scariness increases.. up until the very end (which to be honest freaked me out totally).  Overall this movie scares you .. but in a different way. It doesn't use the 'Hollywood Cheese Factor' of constant blood and guts and special effects to do it. This time you're scared for real.",10,1,2,23 July 1999
