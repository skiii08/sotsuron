Requiem for a Dream," Ultimate
","I wanted to say something new but it seems like everyone here had said great things about this movie and I just agree. What could I say more ? it will stay in my top list for a long time.Couldn't speak after it... I was stuck on my seat, the casting, directing, original score were brilliant. This movie just shows reality : the good effects, the bad effects... whatever, I feel concerned as my best friend died of it.",Null,0,0,4 April 2001
