Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," I'm Supposed to be all excited about the first 3D of Pirates
","However, after watching the first 15 minutes , I go 'blech',everything was so clich√© and total idiot, how can they wrote a ground breaking script like this, Fountain of Youth, adventure of getting Mermaid tears,vampire mermaid fall in love with a priest,Jack Sparrow ex was a pirate and pretends to be him,just return the ground breaking review~anybody pay for the dialogue? next time please hold an audition in kindergarden and I sure the kid get a better idea and plot line.the truth is this movie in the name of Jack Sparrow pirate series and cheat me to watch a Disney little mermaid! I give this one star and much lower the Date Movie or scary movie series because scary series does suck but its not cheating!",1,5,13,18 May 2011
