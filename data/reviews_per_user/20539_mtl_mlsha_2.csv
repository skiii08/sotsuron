Lucky Number Slevin," huh? oh yeah it all makes sense now.
","Although this movie leaves viewers in the dark for about 2 hours, it all makes sense in the last five minutes and leaves you completely satisfied. The first 20 minutes involve Bruce Willis telling the story of a brutal murder involving a fixed horse race gone wrong. Right away, you begin to feel for the characters, although they all end up dead in the first half hour. After this, we meet the real characters. Slevin (Josh Hartnett), is a seemingly harmless guy who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Lindsey (Lucy Liu) is a quirky neighbor we're initially annoyed with but learn to love. The two rival mafia leaders are The Boss (Morgan Freeman), named because he's the boss, and The Rabbi (Ben Kingsley), because, of course, he's a rabbi. ALthough it starts out bloody, 'Slevin' is actually pretty hilarious, and confusing, but ultimately satisfying. Throughout, the characters interact seemingly randomly, but smoothly, sarcastically, and often in a way that makes you laugh out loud. If you rent 'Slevin,' know that you will certainly be frustrated, but if you can restrain from popping out the DVD halfway through, you'll ultimately be satisfied as it will all make sense.",10,5,7,17 October 2006
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," harry potter 4
","In the 4th installment of J.K. Rowling's 'Harry Potter' series, Mike Newell ('Four Weddings and a Funeral') takes over as director for Alfonso CuarÏŒn. 10 minutes into the movie, at the Quidditch World Cup, it's obvious that Newell is aiming to make the movie scarier than the other three, when we see a group of guys in skeleton masks and hoods walking through camp lighting everything on fire. This is most likely what earned the movie its PG-13 rating.Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) wakes up from a dream of an old man who gets murdered by Wormtail, Voldermort's assistant. Harry wakes up, and he's at Ron Weasly's house. This is one part I don't like, because I enjoy the parts where Harry is at his aunt and uncle's house. Right away, he's at school. In the book, this is about 10 chapters long. As soon as he's at school, the other two schools, Beuxbatons and Durmstrang, arrive. Right after that, we hear about the Tri-wizard tournament, which, in the book, took much longer and was developed better.Most of the stuff I look forward to in the other movies, such as the House Sorting, and the Dursley's, and the banquet at the beginning of the year, were all left out, because the Tournament takes up most of the movie. One of the most popular characters, Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), is barely in this movie at all. Some characters new to the story are Fleur Delacour (Clemence Poesy), the representative in the tournament from Beuxbatons, Viktor Krum (Stanislav Ianevski) the representative from Durmstrang, and Professor 'Mad-Eye' Moody (Brendan Gleeson), a new, extremely paranoid teacher. Also, Katie Leung plays Cho Chang, and Robert Pattinson as Cedric Diggory, the other Hogwarts champion.There are two problems with basing a movie on a book. One is, people who have the books memorized will be upset that the movie doesn't follow the book exactly. If it had, it would've been about 8 hours long. Already, at 2 hours and 37 minutes, it's much longer than average. The second problem is, if you read the book, then go see the movie, there's no surprise. You know what's going to happen, so you spend the time waiting for the end, and you don't enjoy the movie as much.",8,3,5,24 November 2005
