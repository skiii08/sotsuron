The Hangover," Better than it has any right to be
","Because I've never drank alcohol a day in my life, or don't know what it's like to be a drunk, I didn't think this movie would appeal to me, at least in terms of entertainment. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked it. I can't say there are any big laughs, but I smiled a lot, and didn't feel like I was enduring these characters, rather than enjoying what they were doing. I do think a lot of critics are gave this movie too much credit. I can't see how this is great, rather than merely good. Another thing: The night before the hangover, these guys sure don't do a lot of drinking. I'm thinking to myself: 'Small glasses? That's it?' I expected to see something more along the lines of, say, a lot of drinking at some party. Still, the movie never lets up, and that's enough to recommend it.*** out of ****",Null,1,3,25 June 2011
Training Day," One session you'll want to skip
","If only the preceding moments were just as interesting...When Jake is held at gunpoint in a bathtub, that's when Training Day comes alive. Now why couldn't everything that came before be as good? For a while, this movie sounds better on paper than acted out, and that's unfortunate, despite a great premise, that, for a while, goes absolutely nowhere. Hawke is completely miscast, and Washington just can't save it. Now, I enjoyed it a little more when it's just these two, but when they're around others, that's when the movie goes flat. And a two-hour running time? Are these filmmakers serious? I can't help thinking the boring stuff would have been more forgivable had they been, at the very least, even slightly shorter. Want to see a good movie? See 'The Man' instead. While it's a comedy, and this one is action. it is at least much, much better than this misfire (mostly, anyway).** out of ****",Null,0,1,26 February 2016
Meet the Parents," Meet the Parents, You'll be Glad You Did
","I have this movie on DVD, so I recommend to anyone who loves it, buy a copy if you don't already have one. Although if you watch it too many times, it may not be as good as it was the first time, because then you didn't know what was going to happen. After repeated viewings, you'll still enjoy it, even though you won't laugh as much or often. This fact applies not just to this movie, but comedies in general. I still get a kick out of the part where Ben Stiller is laughed at by two of the relatives because they don't believe he's a nurse. Not a big part, but funny nonetheless. I didn't see the movie just on DVD. I saw it years ago on the big screen, and on pay-per-view.*** out of ****",9,1,2,11 March 2010
The Fan," A so-so movie that takes too long to get to the point
","DeNiro gives an okay, but one-note performance as a dedicated baseball fan who, as a result of his fixation on Bobby Rayburn (#11), loses his job and family. Other than to show that he has a bad temper, I don't see how they are relevant to the movie. I think too much time is spent on the scenes at home, on the job, and on the baseball game itself. And DeNiro's acting just didn't seem genuine at all. In most movies about people who go from obsessing to stalking, this line is crossed at about halfway through the movie. But here, it doesn't happen until almost the very end, which is too little too late. Also, how could the Benicio Del Toro have really been killed if this was only seen in Renard's mind? Or did I miss something? It's not a bad movie, but it could have been more.** out of ****",Null,0,2,20 August 2012
Orphan," To my surprise, this is better than satisfactory
","This is by no means groundbreaking, needless to say. But if you go to the movies to be entertained more than enlightened, who cares if it's unoriginal, formulaic, and predictable? 'Clifford', 'Problem Child' 1 & 2, 'Joshua' , 'The Omen' (both versions), and 'The Bad Seed', are also about bad children (the first two are comedies). This one stars a girl, which may explain why I liked it a lot. I guess girls take evil a bit more seriously than boys. The more evil a character is, the better. And the more they say and/or do, the better. The movie accomplishes just enough and tells just enough story, that the movie doesn't feel long or short.***1/2 out of ****",9,1,2,9 September 2010
Yes Man," It wouldn't kill this guy to say 'no' at least once
","Of all the Jim Carrey films I've seen, I've enjoyed every one, except 'Yes Man'. Here is a potentially good idea for a movie, especially a James Carrey movie, wasted. There are a lot of missed opportunities here. I did enjoy one scene that took place in an airport. But this is an otherwise disappointing movie. Didn't someone have the nerve to tell Jim Carrey to carefully read the script? What the movie boils down to is, that this is just an idea in search of a movie. Jim Carrey (or his character, for that matter) doesn't take any chances. He may say yes, but shouldn't he show it as well? He and Zooey Deschenal exhibit little chemistry (These two have the same birthday in real life, by the way, except for the years). Let's cut to the chase: this guy doesn't look like he's really in a crisis (If that's what he's supposed to be in). It's a mildly entertaining film, but basically, I didn't buy it for a second. It's not especially funny, believable, or interesting. But it does have its moments.** out of ****",4,1,2,28 March 2010
Horrible Bosses," Not a laugh riot, but this is worth paying money for
","I wasn't interested in the movie when I first heard about it. Then immediately after reading more about the plot, the movie appealed to me. It's an entertaining movie that lives up to its potential. Kevin Spacey, of course, is a scene-stealer. If you find yourself experiencing deja vu watching his performance, then you might remember him in 'Swimming with Sharks'. Except he was the star. Colin Farrel is okay as the son of a dead boss. As for Jennifer Aniston's character, her performance is great, too. But I didn't think of this character as a boss. Just as an assistant. 'Horrible Bosses' is very entertaining from start to finish, and not consistent in its second act. One of the bosses is killed by another, Another doesn't get killed like promised, and the third boss's story never gets resolved at all. But that doesn't make the movie any less likable.*** out of ****",Null,1,2,19 July 2011
Knowing," Needs a different ending
","'Knowing' is a great idea for a premise: A kid in 2009 receives a paper with numbers drawn by a kid in 1959 from that school's time capsule. At first his dad thinks it shouldn't of been taken home, but then something intrigues him: to use all these numbers to predict the future. The scene where John tries to stop a plane from crashing is particularly interesting, even if only visually. The movie is very interesting and well-made, up until the very end, that is. Calling the so-called ending preposterous is putting it to mildly. Why? Because these last scenes belong in an entirely different movie. It may be science fiction, but it doesn't fit the rest of the movie. It should of given us something to put everything to a close, or to make it pay off. Even a scene where the predictions were all just a dream would have been acceptable. I recommend the movie, expect for its conclusion.**1/2 out of ****",Null,0,1,15 September 2010
Bad Teacher," Does for education what 'Bad Santa' did for Christmas
","This, I guess, is supposed to be in the vein of 'Bad Santa', but it doesn't quite push the envelope far enough. However, it is very effective comedy and the filmmakers keep things moving. Later on, however, the movie loses a little steam, because the story about the love triangle between Diaz and Punch is mostly flat. I would have liked to see less of this, and a lot more in the classroom, or at least involving the students more. When the nature of the title character is exposed, the movie does get interesting again. I just wish the film were more consistent with the interesting stuff. The film also contains an unnecessary bathroom joke (which occurs at the end of the scene).**1/2 out of ****",Null,1,4,23 December 2011
The Amazing Spider-Man," Great movie, but was there really any need for a remake?
","If you love, or even just like Spider-Man, and enjoy action, TASM will give you your money's worth. My only quibble is that Andrew Garfield is no Tobey Maguire, and Emma Stone is no Kirsten Dunst. They're a bit shallow in an otherwise entertaining film. But did this really need to be remade, or was this merely a substitute for the abandoned Spider-Man 4? I would have liked to have seen another sequel, but then again, a sequel would have been the same story anyway, so it wouldn't have made any difference. Even though I enjoyed watching the evil lizard, which is put to good use, it's nothing special. Since Peter Parker's aunt and uncle are secondary to the plot, they really aren't necessary (Sally Field's just here for the money) After all, the movie is about Spider-Man himself (and versus the villain), and mostly his love interest, but not his family. *** out of ****",Null,1,2,13 July 2012
Meet the Fockers," Meet the Fockers, but with reservations
","The last(and only)time I saw 'Fockers' was six years ago on the big screen, and I was mildly disappointed. And what is Barbara Streisand doing in the movie? I'm sorry to say, but she does not belong in a comedy, at least not this type. However, Dustin Hoffman is an ideal choice, and believe me, that's saying something. 'Fockers' is not quite at the level of 'Parents', but I enjoyed parts of it. What it boils down to is, this is a rehash of the original story. Again, we have a cat on the toilet, this time flushing himself. And I'm not so sure the term 'Meet the Fockers', has quite the same ring as 'Meet the Parents'. Trust me, using the word 'parents' is more promising than a proper noun. So, if you haven't seen this one, and are expecting laughs equal to the first movie, don't get your hopes up too high.**1/2 out of ****",5,0,0,11 March 2010
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Some clever moments here and there, but it doesn't quite take off
","The film starts off pleasant enough, and for a while it shows Walter having his daydreams, which are genuinely enjoyable, I might add. The problem with this film is that it's only engaging up until Mitty begins his journey through Iceland and Greenland. And the scenes after the end of the journey. I thought his journey was a little tedious and unnecessary. Apparently the filmmakers no longer thought the daydreams were cutting it. If some of this journey was supposed to be one as well, then I must have not been paying attention. Two scenes that don't work: One in a bar, and another where Walter attempts to jump into a boat. As for the film's characters, including Walter Mitty, there's nothing special about them. Walter's female coworker (played by Kristen Wiig) doesn't serve any purpose other than to give him someone to confide in. Is she supposed to be a love interest? The only real interesting one is Ted, Walter's boss, even though he doesn't do a lot in the entire movie. While I did enjoy the chemistry between Penn and Stiller, and the way the scene plays out, the journey is just not worth the payoff. Also unnecessary: meeting the eharmony guy in person, which, I think, only exists to show us it was Patton Oswalt on the phone.**1/2 out of ****",Null,7,11,14 January 2014
The Mist," Old-fashioned but enjoyable
","To enjoy old-fashioned entertainment like this, you don't have to be as old as your parents or grandparents. People in a community who are in a grocery store are suddenly forced to stay inside and fight for their lives when a mysterious and unexpected fog blocks the view of anything outside. We do get a mysterious creature in the back of the store. I would have preferred lots more creatures. Then you've got a stubborn man (played by Andre Braugher) who refuses to have anything to do with these people, which I think helps move the story along. If there's anything that is not necessary or particularly interesting, it's Marcia Gay Harden's character, a slightly annoying woman who preaches as if she thinks she's superior to everyone else in the store. Give us a meanie instead. But then again, it's not your usual horror movie. Still, it could have used a villain. Also, I think the movie is slow sometimes. Still, rent this movie if you haven't seen it.*** out of ****",Null,0,1,2 April 2011
Unknown," Liam Neeson kicks butt overseas once again.
","Like his character in 'Taken', Neeson plays a loving man who is looking to seek those who've done him wrong. Unlike his character in that movie, he is not looking for kidnappers, but those who might have something to do with the fact that his wife no longer remembers him after he had a terrible taxi crash. That's one thing the movie never explains: why is his wife the one who is acting crazy when she wasn't involved in the crash? Or was I missing something? Anyway, the movie is very effective, at least with the material we expect from a movie like this. What's new, or apparently new, is the former Stasi agent and this Nazi stuff. I could have done without this part. Frank Langella plays a character, who, it turns out, is not on his brother's side after all. This I did not see coming. Why he underplays it, I have no clue. I also enjoyed the last sequence in the hotel, where an alarm goes off, and now Neeson has to destroy a bomb from going off, and also to stop the guy who stole his identity. The way this fight plays out, it looks nothing (or at least almost nothing) like I've seen before.*** out of ****",Null,1,3,8 April 2011
Gran Torino," Clint Eastwood makes the movie a treat to watch
","You don't have to be an Eastwood fan, or even have seen any of his movies, to know what to expect from this performance. He plays a grumpy man who wants nothing to do with his neighbors or anyone else. Whether the movie explains if he was like this before his wife's death, I don't remember. It's been a couple years since I saw the movie (I review some movies with a vague memory). Eventually, he warms up, especially to one of the Korean neighbors, whom he takes under his wing. It's kind of like a dramatic 'Grumpy Old Men', only without one of the men. The ending is sad and will shock you, especially if you can relate to Eastwood's character.*** out of ****",Null,0,3,9 April 2011
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs," Unlike most other animated movies, this has an ideal premise
","I don't watch new animated movies anymore. I think ever since the original Toy Story, decent ideas for movie animation have declined. Making an animated movie and merely coming up with something (original or not) isn't enough. It should be something that's worth the trip to the theater. It doesn't have to be original, but I do expect something worthwhile. 'Monster House' is such an example. I thought the characters and story were pleasant enough. Anyway, 'Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs' is one of those rare quality animated movies that's actually worthy of itself. I saw the 3-D version, but I'm sorry to say that I don't recall seeing absolutely any 3-D. Was I wearing the glasses for nothing? Aside from wearing the glasses, this movie is by no means a waste of time.*** out of ****",Null,0,0,10 January 2011
World Trade Center," Should have been a great movie instead of a merely good one
","I realize that certain people, especially in national tragedies, need special attention, but I wanted to see a lot more events that took place on 9/11, than just what these two officers and their families went through? Why not a story where kids, very young kids, are separated from their parents, and are now orphans, or a story where some people are now jobless, because their workplaces were in or near the Twin Towers? Or how people across the country are affected by it? But no, instead of learning about what results from the tragedies, we have to sit through 2 hours of watching Officer John McCoughlin and William Jimeno trapped under rubble, and see their families worry. I still enjoyed the movie, but I didn't learn as much as I thought I should have.*** out of ****",7,1,3,11 March 2010
The Hangover Part II," Equally good as the first movie
","If you thought 'The Hangover' delivered the goods, you'll just as much enjoy this sequel as I did. I expected not to like it as much, since most movie sequels are inferior to the first movie (or previous movie, if you're referring to further sequels). I expected not to like it as much because these guys are now outside of the U.S. (except for the beginning). Plus, their adventures this time around are funnier. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the movie. Don't listen to the critics who pan it - they knew this was going to be the same movie. This (and part one) are movies you don't need to be hung-over to enjoy. I can't wait to see what part III (and there will be one) has in store.*** out of ****",Null,2,4,21 January 2012
Prisoners," It's not a particularly conventional thriller, but I enjoyed it nonetheless
","If you're looking for lots of violence, blood, gore, and a predictable storyline, you won't find it here. But that doesn't mean it's boring. And you also won't find any standard villains either (can you think of any other movie with a bad guy with a low I.Q. that never (or almost never) speaks? While that may be unique, it doesn't really help things. I would have preferred some more talking. Anyway, unlike conventional thrillers, this one doesn't solve things too easily, too quickly. An almost unrecognizable Melissa Leo plays the aunt of one of the kidnappers, who, it turns out, is also a sicko. Even though this is supposed to come as no surprise, I didn't see it coming. If you didn't either, you will be just as surprised as I was. Aside from Hugh Jackman being held at gunpoint, and the opening scenes with everybody together on Thanksgiving Day, there's nothing here you've seen before. I recommend it.*** out of ****",Null,0,0,9 October 2013
Taken," Familiar material delivers on its promise
","Except for the Paris scenes, there's almost nothing new here. Liam Neeson is an ideal choice for his role. Fortunately, he doesn't overdo it. I don't mind unoriginal movies as long as they entertain. And unlike most hostage pictures, we don't see the kidnapped person again until the very end. Another original aspect of the movie is when a couple of kidnapped victims (including the one played by Maggie Grace) are being 'sold'. I also didn't find the kidnappers to be especially evil, but that doesn't detract from how good the movie is. Mostly the movie is just Liam Neeson beating the crap out of the bad guys and him and them shooting at one another.*** out of ****",Null,0,0,2 April 2011
Limitless," Once the plot kicks in, the movie eventually delivers on its promise
","Aside from the premise, there's nothing really special about the movie. DeNiro's performance ranges somewhere between phoning it in and being pleasant enough. Aside from making money off Eddie, I see no reason for DeNiro's character. Fortunately, the picture never takes itself too seriously. When Eddie is about to start running off to the subway, the camera photography shows us this vantage point. I thought this was awesome. Not a lot goes on in the film. Our protagonist takes the so-called drug, runs afoul of bad guys, meets with a powerful tycoon, does some explaining to his girlfriend, and that's about it. If there were a few more characters, and some suspense to it, it might be a better movie.**1/2 out of ****",Null,1,2,22 March 2011
Jack Reacher," Entertaining 'Dirty Harry' Wannabe
","It's always nice to see Tom Cruise appear in an action movie. While he's no Clint Eastwood or Charles Bronson, his performance alone makes this worth watching. It's refreshing to see that he and lawyer Helen have nothing more than a professional relationship, something that's not in the movies too often (or maybe I have a bad memory). Also, the character of Sandy is nonessential to the movie. They first meet in a bar, but so what? If there was a point to this so-called meeting, I must have missed it. Robert Duvall has a thankless role as a gun shop owner, and one of the characters (whose name I won't spoil), I'm sorry to say, is yet another of Hollywood's good guy-turned bad characters. The point of these characters, is beyond me. 'Jack Reacher' doesn't exactly break new ground, but it's highly entertaining.*** out of ****",Null,5,14,26 December 2012
War of the Worlds," Not really spectacular, but it gets the job done
","If you like aliens from outer space, mass destruction, and explosions, here's something for you. However, the story is not on the same level as the special effects. And we spend a little too much time getting to know Ray and his estranged kids. And so does Ray. I mean, he'd be saving their lives one way or another, right? But, as soon as these three adjust to one another, the story improves. Plus, I didn't buy Tim Robbins' performance as the survivalist. It's a cheesy performance, if you ask me. The film seems to be more about surviving than fighting off the aliens. In other words, it's more battle than war, hence the title. Still, it's a worthy couple hours to kill.*** out of ****",Null,1,3,16 September 2010
Man on Fire," Boring, overlong, and a bit disappointing
","You'd think with a title like 'Man on Fire', this would be a great movie. Sadly, that is not the case. First off, it's trying to be something other than a formula film, and that is understandable. What I don't understand, however, is why it has to be so long, muddled, disjointed, and unsatisfying. This is hardly a movie about ransom. It feels more like a movie about drug trafficking, except that the drugs are only a minor issue here. There doesn't seem to be anybody (or anything) truly at stake. For a while, the movie plays fair, but that's only because the girl hasn't been in any danger yet. ** out of ****",Null,0,1,28 April 2012
Taken 2," Doesn't disappoint
","Judging from the trailer, I didn't think this would be as good as the first movie. It's not as suspenseful (we don't see enough of the bad guys) as the events in Paris, but it's nevertheless an entertaining sequel. I suppose it's not as suspenseful because the characters (the Millers) have been in this situation before, so there aren't any real surprises. I wouldn't say the final confrontation between Neeson and the head honcho is a letdown, but it doesn't deliver the way it's supposed to. But that's just a quibble. If you're looking for something completely different, then this is probably isn't for you.*** out of ****",Null,0,0,18 October 2012
Vanilla Sky," Is there a point?
","Vanilla Sky is simply put, a boring movie, especially towards the end. The interrogation scenes, with Kurt Russell, are better, but not by much. And most of the time, the film apparently shows the flashbacks in random order, considering we see a disfigured face, then a normal face, and back again. Show them in order, for crying out loud. And why does the entire face need to be covered, when in fact, it only looks bad on one side? The movie, as it is, is confusing enough. I enjoyed Jason Lee's scenes, but they're not enough to recommend the entire movie. Not even close. After David falls to the ground, the film should have just ended. There is no need for a pointless movie like this to be so god damn long. When I saw Julie in Sofia's body (Julia actually killed herself), I knew the movie was going on longer than it needed to. And why does it take forever to end? When it did, I was starting to lose patience. And what does the term 'Vanilla Sky' mean, anyway?** out of ****",Null,1,3,20 March 2016
Bruce Almighty," A role that's tailor-made for Carrey
","Not only is this part perfect for Jim Carrey, but this is one of those rare movies with an original idea: Exploit God. It's rare for a comedy to have an original idea, since there are only so many things that can be made funny. Just when you think 'Bruce Almighty' has no more twists and turns, along comes more. To be fair, I think, the film gets a little bogged down with Carrey's mannerisms towards the end. But of course, it doesn't detract from the pleasure of watching Carrey or the film. One highlight (which I found very funny): When Bruce is at the TV Station making Evan Baxter (who would later appear in 'Evan Almighty') look like a complete idiot. Who wouldn't find this funny? *** out of ****",Null,0,0,28 November 2010
Footloose," Entertaining, but not necessarily exciting
","'Footloose' is a pleasant-enough movie as it is, but I think it could have used tougher material and characters with more depth. We don't get nearly enough scenes involving the priest. Even if he is an obvious character, he still could, would and should have given the movie some juice. Ren, the character previously played by Kevin Bacon, isn't as troubled as you'd expect him to be, or as he should have been. With the title 'Footloose', I expected something more. And I also wanted more dancing, too. The only dancing that's offered here comes during the opening titles, the last scene of the movie, and somewhere after dancing has been outlawed. If this is supposed to be a 'musical', then the movie really falls short. I was moderately entertained, but not necessarily surprised. On another note, doesn't Ren's girlfriend remind you of Ellen Pompeo? And a little of Jennifer Aniston? **1/2 out of ****",Null,0,4,30 October 2011
The Hangover Part III," I really enjoyed this sequel
","While part 3 has nothing to do with the predecessors, other than the characters, it doesn't diminish the charm or humor of this one. I was pleasantly surprised. Actually 'surprised' might be overstating it, since I was expecting to like it anyway. I have two very minor problems about the film: Giving Ken Jeong a bigger role, and the scenes with Melissa McCarthy. Again, these are just minor problems. Mr. Chow is funny, but not that funny. What's funny in small doses isn't necessarily funny in bigger ones. At least the guy isn't annoying. Also, I didn't think Zach or Melissa had any chemistry here. Aside from being attracted to one another, the scenes in the Pawn Shop serve no purpose. Otherwise, the movie is very funny and entertaining.*** out of ***",Null,0,0,11 June 2013
Click," Delivers on its promise, but could have been slightly better.
","When I first read about 'Click' on ComingSoon.net, I thought this was a terrific idea for a comedy, and was looking forward to it. And it does not at all disappoint, especially if you enjoy Adam Sandler comedies. Christopher Walken is ideal as this professor (or whoever he's supposed to be), who is found in the 'Way Beyond' of Bed, Bath and Beyond. David Hasselhoff is also a hoot, even though he's not seen much. However, I didn't buy (or was even interested in) the scenes with Sandler and Kate Beckinsale in bed together. No need for those scenes. The 'dramatic' parts toward the end of the movie are okay, but the movie would have benefited without them. And I think the movie could have used a different ending. Here, it's just Sandler throwing away the remote. Not exactly a payoff, if you ask me. But those are quibbles in a comedy that otherwise works.*** out of ****",Null,0,1,13 January 2011
Coach Carter," Samuel L. Jackson is wonderful as usual
","'Coach Carter' may be based on a true story, but that doesn't make the movie original. Actually, Jackson has done this material before, sans the basketball. If you've seen 'One Eight Seven', you'll know what I mean. The only difference is that the kids in this movie aren't as troubled as the ones in the earlier movie. Here, it's the basketball that makes these kids emotionally stronger (as well as physically, of course). But did we really need to see them play the big game, especially as a tacked-on ending? Besides, we know they're going to win, anyway. The film would have been enough ending before the game is played.

Law Abiding Citizen," 'Saw' meets 'Death Wish'
","'Law Abiding Citizen' combines elements of 'Saw' and 'Death Wish', but without the traps and weapons. If you're expecting gunfights and physical torture traps, you'll be sorely disappointed. If you're not expecting these things, but are still looking for a story heavy on plot, you'll be disappointed. But if you're expecting an entertaining movie that delivers the goods, and tells a reasonable story, then you'll enjoy yourself. Gerard Butler is no Tobin Bell or Charles Bronson, but he is fit for this role, I suppose. The subplot involving this D.A.'s family is unnecessary. It doesn't connect with the rest of the movie, to say the least. Also, Foxx's and Butler's characters spend most of the movie putting up with one another, suggesting the film could have gone a little more over-the-top. If the movie had been more about the justice system, it might have been more entertaining. Still, I recommend it if you haven't seen it.*** out of ****",Null,0,0,10 January 2011
Up in the Air," I Don't See What All The Fuss Is About
","It's not to say that this isn't a good movie, but what's so great about it? Why is this considered award worthy? I'll grant you there are good performances, but the movie itself isn't quite as good. George Clooney is good here, but he's subdued. Aside from firing employees, and taking a young college graduate (played by Anna Kendrick) under his wing, what is the point? I am recommending the movie, but only as entertainment, nothing else. I enjoyed the movie, but basically, this is nothing special. I was expecting something conventional, say, for example, a hostage, or maybe Clooney and another employee his age trying to compete with one another. But, what we get isn't much of a story. And we also get a subplot about a family wedding, which I think could have been told more often during the whole movie. I was actually more interested in the wedding than I was in the main story.*** out of ****",6,8,15,11 March 2010
