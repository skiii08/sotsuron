Skyfall," Bond is back and better than ever!!
",I've been reading a lot of the reviews on here and I am astonished over how many people bashed Skyfall. Saying things like it's the worst Bond movie ever. Really people??!! Let's get real here. If you want to talk about worst Bond movies ever watch all the Roger Moore Bond movies. Skyfall blew me away when I went to see it. I've always been a Bond fan. I loved Casino Royale! Daniel Craig encompasses everything that Bond is and stands for. Quantum of Solace sucked. Skyfall is by far the best Bond movie yet. It's a much darker Bond film. A lot of people have issues with that. If you want lighthearted and camp watch Roger Moore. I really enjoyed this movie. For the first time you get a glimpse into Bond's past. I really liked that. You have a great villain that isn't to over the top like so many Bond villains before him who want world domination. Javier Bardem was amazing and very creepy as Silva. He played a villain that you can sympathize with and totally understand why he's doing what he's doing. He's definitely the best Bond villain yet. It was nice to see Moneypenny and Q introduced. Another thing I loved about this movie was the opening title song by Adele. WOW!!! Such a beautiful and powerful song. It's easily my all time favorite Bond song. Skyfall was such a breath of fresh air. I don't understand why so many people hated it. It's an intelligent Bond movie with a great story and is more grounded in reality that what we are used to. It is a darker Bond for sure but I prefer it that way. That's how Ian Fleming wrote him. If you want to watch a good Bond movie ignore all the naysayers and check it out. The name is Bond...

Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Amazingly good!!!!
",First off let me state the fact that I am not a movie critic. I am a lover of movies especially superhero movies. I go to the movies to be entertained and to escape from this world for a few hours. If you want a review from a critic go somewhere else. If you want an honest opinion from a movie lover please continue reading. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I've been waiting for this movie for a long time. When I found out that Ben Affleck was cast as Batman I was a bit skeptical. I have never cared for him as an actor. So I was a bit disappointed when he was cast as my favorite super hero. Well he proved me wrong. I thought he was great. He really kicked butt. I found myself rooting for him through the whole movie. He did a very good job playing both Bruce Wayne and Batman. I'm really looking forward to seeing what he does with the character down the road. I don't understand why the critics hate this movie. I never have cared for movie critics. They nitpick everything to death. This is a very good movie with a very good story. It starts off a bit slow but it really picks up. Henry Cavill was good as Superman. I really liked Wonder Woman to. She wasn't in it much but she totally kicks butt when she appears. Jesse Eisenberg was okay as Lex Luthor. He was a bit of a nut. I think he has potential with the character though. Another thing I loved about the movie was Jeremy Irons as Alfred. I really wish he was in the movie more. Hopefully we'll get to see more of him later on down the road. Ignore the critics and watch this movie. Form your own opinion. If you want to be entertained this is the movie for you.,9,2,4,26 March 2016
