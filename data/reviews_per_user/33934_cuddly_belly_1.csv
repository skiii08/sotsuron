Lucky Number Slevin," Lucky Number Slevin - A Review
","A fantastic fast paced movie which has more twists and turns than the usual thriller. Newcomers to Josh Hartnett will not be disappointed as he comes across as a truly multi faceted actor of some note. Bruce Willis puts in the usual moody brooding role he is so good at,but in this instance adds a little more with his hit-man with a heart character. And Lucy Liu puts in a great performance as the wacky but very sexy neighbour with a Columbo type brain who's always got a theory. The plot is fast and furious but unravels at just the right time to keep you more than interested.This is not the film for you if you watch movies in two or more sittings, but its well worth sticking with. Guy Richie fans will love this. Its everything revolver wasn't.",8,1,2,25 June 2007
