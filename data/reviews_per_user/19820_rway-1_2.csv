The Lobster," David Lynch wannabe?
",Yorgos Lanthimos gives David Lynch a run for his money with this film.,4,1,1,21 December 2017
First Man," This movie sucks
","It's an attempt of thirty somethings reinventing a past to suit their progressive leanings. They are idiots. I will make a point never to see any producer, director, and actors involved in this movie ever again. This movie is nothing but a complete reprehensible perversion of history.",1,2,6,22 October 2018
