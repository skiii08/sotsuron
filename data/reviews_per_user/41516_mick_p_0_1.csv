Changeling," a heart wrenching story - too incredible to be true - but is
","I watched Changeling yesterday night. I liked it a lot.It's played by Jolie, who most unfortunately did not get my sympathy, method actress she is not.In a nutshell, the movie talks about how her 9yr old boy goes missing. And the police bring hr back the wrong kid. It may be disputed if the police knew all along that the kid was not hers from the get go (clue is when the kid says 'the police told me to say it' before being carted off by 'his mother' in the middle of the movie), or whether they are just covering their shoddy police work after returning him.But after watching the police officer bullying her, we know that what the reverend says is right : The whole police dept is crooked.The continuance of the movie goes from chilling to unbelievable to damn near sci-fi with the way facts are represented, and how the story continues. Suffice for me to say is, you WILL be SHOCKED.The conclusion is just as good, and the ending does not lull you into any feeling of goody-goodness that the Hollywood movies are so blamed of. the movie could have 'finished' about 15 min before it did, and the point would have been passed across, however the way it IS finished DRIVES the nail in even deeper.I give this One and a half Thumbs up.The movie is saved methodically by John Malkovich in his excellent role as the minister, the chief of police played by Colm Feore, and the confessing kid (Sorry couldn't find out his name).The story is chilling, and after viewing you really feel you need to research it, as did I.so checkout the article regarding the movie at http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=95935010 anyway, The movie is well written and EXTREMELY WELL Directed. the casting of Jolie was a mistake, and the only reason she fits here is because she is SO SKINNY of late that it oddly fits the middle of the movie, but just looks weird at the beginning.What human beings are willing to do to keep there place/jobs is horrendous, and to find out it's for real, and this is based (not even loosely) on a real case, is chilling in the least.You'll be thinking of this one for a while.Clint has been making these 'makes you think' movies for a while.You should also watch Gran Torino by Clint.If you loved this, You might also like STUCK, which is just as impossible to believe.",8,1,3,13 February 2009
