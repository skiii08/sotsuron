The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Breaking Down
","When the midnight screening of the final movie hit my local theatre, I thought, Wow, I'd like to know what all the fuss is about and get to experience the phenomenon that is Twilight. Of course, before seeing the new movie, I have to watch the first 4 parts. I knew it was a chick's movie, but appreciating it as such, I actually enjoyed the first 3 parts. To hold my attention for 6 hours, the first 3 movies must've had something about them. I actually felt I was emotionally invested in the story and was looking forward to Breaking Dawn. So now I've spent a total of 8 hours of my life watching something i wouldn't normally have watched, just so I can go and see the new Twilight film. Do I still want to? After watching Breaking Dawn Pt 1, No. The characters, story and believability of the whole thing is just ruined. I really couldn't care less.",2,6,7,16 November 2012
Fight Club," stupid trying to act clever
","I am not impressed by demonstrations of machismo and male aggression or the idea of fighting in general. The excuse for all of the violence is that it's supposed to lead to philosophical enlightenment about existential reality and the nature of self or something, which does interest me, but I don't think this was really developed. Neither am I impressed by this type of storytelling, that deliberately misleads the audience into believing something which turns out not to be true and then fooling you into thinking it's clever when this is revealed. I'm not fooled but I know a lot of people are. I don't know if this was the movie that caused this irritating format to be repeated so many times. The actors are good, but just trying to act cool all the time isn't difficult. most of the people who like this movie probably do that all the time. I don't even fancy Helena Bonham Carter so there wasn't much in it for me except the whole wretched existence vibe which was OK.",6,1,7,20 March 2009
Lost in Translation," A truly transcendent movie experience to touch your soul (or not)
","At work we just made our top 10 movies of all time lists and my usual faves all figured (Star Wars, American Beauty, Matrix, Forrest Gump, Lord of the Rings, The Sound of Music, Back to the Future, Being John Malkovich), but then I remembered this movie, which I haven't seen for ages, but it had to be the one, above all others because it just touched me in a more profound sense. In fact, this movie transcends all the usual criteria, (plot, script, acting, cinematography etc.)Although those aspects are actually stunning, there is something else, which goes beyond those things that completely nails it for me personally. Some people say they just don't get it or that it's boring because nothing happens, but maybe it's just that they just don't relate to the mood of the film, which is cool. Everybody is different after all. Personally, I'm a sucker for melancholy, self-indulgent slush that lets me wallow in self-pity. I seek it out and gorge myself upon it ;P , But seriously, I yearn to get far away from all the bullshit and find some space where I can really get in touch with my real thoughts and feelings, and totally find myself. Then, to find a genuine connection with a like spirit, that is totally safe........Well, it's a dream I have. Maybe this is the closest I'm gonna get. I hope not, but in the meantime, I wouldn't give a 10 for any other movie I've seen.",10,2,4,15 February 2009
Prometheus," Big Brother in space
","No, I'm not talking about classic sci-fi, I'm talking about the TV show, where the group of retards are locked in a house. Imagine a new series, where the retards are put on a spaceship and sent on a highly technical and expensive scientific mission to an alien world. OK, maybe that sounds like it'd be funny, but actually, it's not supposed to be funny. I was hoping for something reasonably intelligent with some admirable characters and got neither. What we have is the complete breakdown of plot, script, character development and a basic grasp of cause and effect. This is every clich√© in the sci-fi book with no meaning whatsoever. I am just trying to write what I wish I'd read before going out to see this. If you possess any critical faculty at all, do not watch this movie.",1,18,33,6 June 2012
