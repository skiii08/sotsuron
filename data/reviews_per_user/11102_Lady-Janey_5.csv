Catch Me If You Can," Catch it!
","It is the 1960's when Frank Abagnale Jr runs away from his crumbling family and begins the life of a fraudster, inpersonating a pilot, doctor and lawyer, and cashing millons in bad cheques all around the world. All before he had even turned eighteen.So begins a game of cat and mouse where the teenage Frank tries to stay one step ahead of the bumbling FBI Agent Carl Handratty who is trying to track him down. The escape scenes are a lot of fun, the father /son moments between Frank and his father are filled with heartwarming drama. But it is the relationship between Frank and Carl that is special. Right from the opening scene you know Frank is going to prison but you wonder how Carl will eventually catch him. And what a scene when it comes!Walken is great as Frank Snr.Hanks's Handratty is far from his best work, but that certainly does not mean he's bad. He's just not in Forest Gump mode.DiCaprio steals the show after being eclipsed by Day Lewis in GONY. He is outstanding in the role of the supremely confident fraudster Frank on one hand, as well as the vunerable kid who justs wants his family back together. It's a shame that he will probably miss out on an Oscar nomination , because he hasn't been this good since What's eating Gilbert Grape? Definately worth the ten year wait.9/10 - Great film - Based on the true story of the life of Frank Abagnale Jr, Catch me if you can is a treasure of a movie. The action moves at a pace, without seeming to move at all, and you are drawn in a moment from laughter to sadness and back again just as quickly. How refreshing to see a film that shows some originality! Thank you Mr Spielberg. Thank you Leonardo. You are both forgiven. (A.I, Minority Report, Titanic, The Beach....) More of the same PLEASE!!!",10,1,2,2 February 2003
The Pianist," GREAT Film!
","Just saw this one at the weekend...I's an excellent film and I can see why Polanski and Brody won the Oscars, I suppose. (I still thing it should have been Scorcese and Day-Lewis mind you...)Definately one to watch, for so many reasons. My second favourite of the year...",Null,0,1,10 April 2003
The Departed," Black humour and Head shots! Scorsese at his best....
","The Departed is the best movie I have seen in years. It's gripping, shocking and hilarious all in one movie. Like the best roller-coaster ride, one second you're laughing, the next you're 'Oh my God!' as something really shocking happens.Yes this movie is a remake of the classic Hong Kong 'Infernal Affairs.' I loved the original but somehow the movie seems to sit even better among the Boston Irish.The performances in this movie are all standout, the leads DiCaprio, Damon and Nicholson as well as the support Wahlberg, Baldwin, Sheen and Farmiga. It is their work which makes the Departed special and absolutely gripping. From the hilarious one liners thrown by Wahlberg's Dignam and Baldwin's Ellerby to the intense fear and vulnerability shown by DiCaprio's Costigan as he tries to survive in the world of Nicholson's colourful and terrifying Costello.Surely this movies deserves some acting nods at the Oscars? I would certainly recommend 'The Departed.' You do need to be prepared for Goodfellas type violence and language but if you can live with this then The Departed will be one of the best movies you have seen in a long time.10/10",10,5,10,10 October 2006
The Queen," A compelling watch...
","Having vivid memories of the events surrounding Princess Diana's death, I was instantly interested in the subject matter of this movie. I saw it tonight and was not disappointed, primarily due to the wonderful performance Helen Mirren gave. She captures the mannerisms and character of the Queen wonderfully, giving a truly award worthy performance.The script is well written and balances the sadness of the events of 1997 with some wonderful moments of humour - from Prince Philip, the Queen Mother and regarding the peculiarities of Royal protocol.I would definitely recommend the movie, it ranks high in my top five of movies so far this year.",9,5,10,16 September 2006
Gangs of New York," Great Film!
","I just saw GONY, the long awaited movie when Leo (finally) shows the talent he has! We haven't seen it for a while: not since Romeo and Juliet and possibly parts of Titanic, but its definately back here! Can't wait for Catch me if you can.Having said that it is Daniel Day Lewis who steals the show here. Bill the Butcher was a great character. Really scary.The opening battle seqeunce is really quite gory, but it could have been worse! The only thing that grates here is the modern sound-track that accompanies it. I feels as out of place as the Leo voice over which is at times Irish, but mostly some kind of strange New York dialect.The rest of the movie is great though! Almost Shakespearian. Amsterdam is, as Bill keeps reminding us, just a kid! That is why (spoilers ahead) there cannot be any great showdown between them, because Bill would have to kill Amsterdam. But he won't, as in the really horrible 'scar' and hatchet scene! Amsterdam, unlike his father, is not a worthy victim of the great Bill 'the Butcher' Cutting. (end spoilers.)Easily the best film of the year. Lots of Oscar success ahead. Just don't go in there expecting a huge ending. Its not going to happen. It can't happen, if you watch the rest of the movie!",10,0,0,12 January 2003
