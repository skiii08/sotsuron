The Ring," Ring around the collar
","There are many things that bother me about Hollywood, but nothing is as bad as remaking a film & not getting it right even the second time around. I mean, the story is already there, the plot is set, the budget is better than the original, & you still blow it?!?! Okay, so you watch this well directed (Bjork type) vhs that have all these 'hidden secrets', you a get a phone call (from who, because it never says) & then you die in seven days. I anticipated so much fear in this film & was given about a 10% scare. No, this was not the worst movie in history nor the next 'classic.' The film is full of suspence that builds up to nothing but a dry yet witty, plain yet intense, boring yet mysterious 99cents video rental. Sorry, but the RING is exactly what it is in the film, a 'well'-deep hole or shaft drilled into the ground to store water or oil. Exciting? I think not. 1-10 (3) Z.",Null,0,0,25 October 2002
The Matrix Revolutions," The Revolution...
","I have read some pretty BAD reviews on this film. If you read my list of films I have written about, you'll know I am not into sci-fi at all...But I went to see Revolution & was quiet inpressed! Natually, the 1st one (like most triolgy's) was the best...however, Reloaded & Revolution should in NO WAY BE COMPARED because after seeing all 3 installments, it is just ONE long good movie in one. I rather rate this as just that too. So, with that in mind, THE MATRIX/RELOADED/REVOLUTION gets a 9 out of 10.",Null,0,0,5 November 2003
The Village," The Village...SPOILERS**
","With the publicity & name attached to this film, it is obvious that it would have a HUGE opening. But living in The Village made me want to be evicted! Where is the fear here? Because it was not in this movie. This was such a 'done-to-death' mixture of The Twilight Zone meets that little 'happy-town' that Ewan McGregor visits in BIG FISH, with a little piece of Leo Dicaprio's THE BEACH that it is tired! To top it all off, what was that crap with the 'so-called monster' falling into the hole?? Hello! We saw that in DOLORES CLAIBORNE!! Believe me, I got the picture, the poor world we live in is just so bad that these people tried to create the perfect place, but come-on... if they had time to play 'dress-up' & scare the neighbors, then they had plenty of time to go to the 'town' & get medication from 'those we don't speak of.' BUT NO, instead let's send the blind girl who doesn't have a clue of life outside the open field with 6 houses & skinned sheep! Even though Bryce Howard was THE highlight of the movie, I would have had a scary time driving through the Ghetto as opposed to the two hours I wasted in The Village.",Null,0,0,3 August 2004
High Fidelity," Classic!
","This one is funny. Very dry sense of humor is what spins the records here. John Cusack owns a record store. His staff is bloody hysterical! When his girlfriend that he adores & has an prodigious heart for dumps him, he's crushed. He pulls off the act of 'Mr. Pathetic' better than anyone! He truely believes love is the key to happiness which leds him to dating...& more dating. Lisa Bonet manage to show up in the film which always is a wonderful treat to see her.
