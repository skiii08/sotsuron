Alien 3," Great!
","'Alien 3' is in my opinion, the only film in the series with a personal touch (those having seen Fincher's subsequent work know what I'm talking about). The emphasis is not on the creature, but on the penitentiary environment and on a skinhead Ripley, sibling and  skeleton-like reflection of the alien. She's more a victim than a heroine - this might have been the reason for the film not to be such a hit as the second installment of the series.  The hopeless aspect of the refinery standing for the underground condition and inner emptiness of the lifers - rallied into a battle for survival, as well as the omnipresence of isolation and contamination are well defined motifs reaching high levels by insisting on gros plans and on dark colours, broken here and there by incandescent outbreaks. They should have insisted more on the religious aspect, implying damnation, expiation, sacrifice and transcendence. Sombre, dark, eerie and cerebral, 'Alien 3' is an original sci-fi, providing an amazing score (bravo, Elliot Goldenthal!), a fit cinematography and a careful editing, brought somehow close to perfection. The only minus is the special effects department which could have gotten more than that out of Giger's new designs.",10,2,6,29 May 2002
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Too bad!
","MINOR SPOILERSI watched this like ten years ago in a movie theatre because as I heard they were to speak a bit of Romanian in it. So I said 'Why not?' But I was in for a major disappointment. Still, this wasn't an impediment for me as I watched it again a few days ago and couldn't get through some issues.Coppola thought his film would contribute to cinema vampirology. In what way? Erotic-wise? Hmm... All through the film, I had the feeling it pretends to be something artistic while it's not. The whole arsenal of ancient cheap horror movies is employed here just to amaze fragile audiences: blood splattering, mountain-high waves, all types of flames, ghosts and apparitions. This feeling of 'cheap' maintains even in the scenes presumably shot 'outdoors' when you can easily see indoor props (the forest and the way to Dracula's castle, Lucy Westenra's yard).
But what bothers me the most is the distortion of geography and history altogether. There are unforgivable geographical errors (Varna is thought to be a Romanian harbour, the mounted fearless vampire killers reach Galati in just one night leaving from Varna, Arges flows through Borgo Pass   (W H A T ???)- which is actually Pasul Bargaului). Also, LOTS of clumsy pronunciations of Romanian dialogues ('Thu eshti dragostia vetsii miele', 'Vant, ada-mi an dor di daca', 'Acest barbat umi apartsina').Summing it up, I don't think accuracy was what the producers and director were after. Too bad...I give this film 5 out of 10 and this is for Kilar's score, seduction scene for Keanu (Bercu, Bellucci and Kendrick are great!), makeup effects and costumes.",Null,0,1,8 July 2003
Final Destination," Why do you want to know what's coming?
","POSSIBLE SPOILERS (UNLIKELY, Though)
  Wong's film is a real challenge for all of us that want to find out a second earlier at least what's there ahead of us, waiting... One thing is for sure: you cannot cheat death, nor predict what's next (remember what Master Yoda stated: 'Always in motion is the future'). Briefly, the story goes like this: having a vision of his plane to Paris crashing in flames, Chance Browning gets off, all sweaty, together with several of his fellows and a teacher. The vision gets real and everyone looks at him suspiciously. What they don't realize now is that they were meant to be on that plane and die. Which they will soon do, because Death has something else in store for them and this is definitely not survival.  Extremely well-defined atmosphere (watch out for the anticipations in the opening credits), increasing tension, good acting and brilliant style in editing. Wong pays homage in a very interesting way to great horror movies history figures, naming his characters Browning, Waggner, Lewton a.s.o.
Some viewers may not handle several horrific deaths (Tod's strangulation, for instance - by the way, 'Tod' means 'death' in German, how ironical!) for which goosebumps are guaranteed. Anyway, 'Final Destination' is a film NOT to be missed because it deals in fact with the raw stuff of our innermost expectances and fears. I give it 81/2 out of 10.
Don't startle at the very end!",Null,0,1,6 July 2003
