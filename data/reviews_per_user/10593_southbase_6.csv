The Avengers," Pummeling, fanboyish 1st half, much better themed 2nd half
","Clippy, extremely lore-crammed launch of the first major big-screen Marvel Comics teamup goes a little too much into the anime-type features and weaponry of the SHIELD spy agency and its monochromatic personnel during its first half but soon settles into a huge yet decently Medea-theme-motivated exploration of the superhero identity, and an occasionally funny action film based upon several evolving lines of the comic characters' histories (non-readers who know little if anything of the arcane intricacies of the Marvel Amazing Fantasy/Strange Tales/Tales of Suspense/Ultimate Avengers lines will find this a bit of a slog) as SHIELD's eyepatched lead agent Nick Fury's agency's base is invaded by the Norse god/trickster, Loki (Tom Hiddleston), who steals a new intergalactic energy cube called the Tessaract for the invading alien race called the Chitauri. Fury, with the help of the slinky, red-headed Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) organizes the participation of a small group of terrrestrials/magnates/scientists better known as the Hulk (a pleasantly-greyed Mark Ruffalo)/Iron Man/Thor (the sturdy Chris Hemsworth)/Captain America a.k.a. the Avengers, who recently had a variety of individual adventures but are now needed to defeat Loki and send the Chitauri back to their interdimensional plane. The film's unexplained, insistently locale-centered structuring—weaving from a destroyed SHIELD hidden land base to their floating battleship called a helicarrier, where the Avengers collect and argue their theories—seems almost at cross-purposes at times from the charmingly insultive, rowdy, obdurate band of costumed characters getting some help from the crunching sound-effects and punchy yet glacial camera-work. Director Joss Whedon is not David Lean or even Superman I's Richard Donner (he doesn't seem to know how to subtly build grand and stacked sequences or use scale into centered release points for the audience to invite them into constant rousing applause for these 'heroes'). But Whedon does evoke a non-cynical appreciation of these characters minds (Chris Evans' Captain America is as much a straight shooter as straight arrow) and hearts (Robert Downey Jr's Tony Stark/cardiac-wounded Iron Man probably comes off the most believable considering he had two full screen adventures of his own, yet the character's mogulistic resources—enough to bankrupt several continents—beggar the question as to why he would need SHIELD at all instead of starting his own superhero gang), and their clear-cut stagings and streaking, powerful choreography even during the most complicated effects scenes does make the appropriate impact. Once the Avengers assemble to defend New York City against a final invasion of giant slug-like creatures and Chitauri attackers THE AVENGERS illustrates the dichotomy of current genre epics, written for tween or undiscriminating audiences yet grandly casting decently talented actors in noble roles for the staying power of a halfway legitimate drama, and settling for digital-image glorification of a superhero costume instead.",6,1,4,12 May 2012
Argo," Dedicated & suspenseful if unilluminating recreation from unpopular U.S. modern era
","This reviewer still owns an original copy of Jim Steranko's Mediascene Prevue Magazine, which states in a 3-page advance story on the upcoming movie version of Roger Zelazny's novel 'Lord of Light' in mid-1980 that famed comic artist Jack Kirby would be the film's visual concept artist. Amidst some large sized blowups of Kirby's sketches, the artist (known to have been a stereotypically jovial and saucy personality in the tough, deadline-demanding comics industry trade of the time) is quoted in a strangely awed and subdued manner this time. ('This film is going to have tremendous impact on the world. It will allow Eastern and Western Man to relate to each other...I believe the way we're conceiving this film could contribute to saving the world.', {Issue 41, Vol. 2, No. 1, pg. 26}. Mr. Kirby (portrayed by Michael Parks) is practically non-existent in Ben Affleck's dramatization of the events surrounding the use of the unmade film's material by the CIA during the Iran hostage crisis of 1979-80. But the resulting film--titled ARGO in tribute to agent Tony Mendez' (Affleck) retitling of 'Lord of Light' to create a bogus film company team that would be a cover for 6 State Dept. employees that he would try to sneak out of Iran before they could be captured by the military and possibly killed--is a concise, decently-staged, well paced caper film that recalls quieter, purposeful, politically informed works that were quite common during the intense days of the US/Russian Cold War by directors like Martin Ritt, Alan Pakula or John Frankenheimer. Mr. Affleck as director is not quite there yet in high-technical expertise of the medium as those three but the film's low-keyed photographic color tones, good contrasts in his art direction and props as the hostages see their world of mechanics and expensive travel replaced with ancient stone, wood, and handspun fabrics and circular containment, and his crosscutting between three separate story lines begins placing his craft toward their related achievements (the bogus film production in Hollywood includes the real-life makeup artist John Chambers {John Goodman, an uncannily accurate portrayal} calling in some old friends in the industry to help out including a rough-hewn film producer {Alan Arkin} who slowly sees the mission as a way of regaining some ethical ideals he appears to have lost in himself over many years. The third storyline at the CIA with Mendez' boss {Bryan Cranston, who provides a superb moment in his performance during a bureaucratic snag during the climax} is the most directly wordy and not entirely epic of the three (Affleck laudably has several real-life personalities from Pres. Jimmy Carter's top administration as characters riding herd or clearing the increasingly difficult details of the mission yet they don't quite come across as powerful or accurate as they should {Where was Chief of Staff's Hamilton Jordan's native North Carolina accent?}). Yet the film's central narrative trajectory--with Affleck being able to keep his very numerous locations and group motions distinct and geometrically designed to bring the small group of seven people finally--to the Swiss Air boarding gate at Tehran Airport and the edge of escape and freedom. Ultimately a thriller/suspense film merely dusted by politics (answering or correcting the supposed inaccuracies and dramatic liberties would probably have required an additional hour's length minimum), Ben Affleck's ARGO does at least very respectfully illuminate in both a Hollywood-nostalgic and Washington-heroic manner a frustrating and downbeat era regarding the Middle East for many Americans where (until between the release of the remaining Iranian hostages and the death of Osama bin Laden) the good guys actually scored a victory.",7,1,2,5 December 2012
Bolt," Fine Family Film about Plucky Pooch
","New Disney animated film that reportedly went through some development problems early in its production finally appears as a kind of unofficial semi-sequel to 2004's THE INCREDIBLES (had that film also included a family superdog), about a young White German Shepherd named Bolt (John Travolta, strongly used during the first hour or so but whose voice largely disappears during the last 20-30 minutes), employed along with his young owner Penny (the ear-popping Miley Cyrus) in the production of outlandish adventures for an unnamed studios' output of media and theme park attractions. When awakened to his contradictory usages by several of the other animal actors at the studio, the little pup goes off on his own by unexpectedly getting shipped to the East Coast and forgotten by everyone except Penny and her mother. Joined by an amusingly smart-mouthed alleycat named Mittens (Susie Essman, whose voicework skillfully displays comic skepticism without becoming one-note or overly hostile) and an overfed TV addicted Ohio hamster named Rhino (Mark Walton), Bolt decides to make his way back home somehow and prove to Penny and the audience that his life matters to what they have asked of him. Slightly longer-than-normal film of its type at first uses the additional material with seemingly traditional cartoon-movie reinforcements like a song midpoint (albeit good) or the moral that money can only exist to ultimately feed business kingdoms and royalty so don't make it do anything else. But alongside these genre tropes directors Byron Howard and Chris Williams inject energizing and inventive elements, particularly through the dedicated verbal character interplay of Bolt and his bizarre animal contacts (including blankly-eyed head-bobbing pigeons and dialog-feeding actor felines), or their encounters with a wide range of human physical types who come off more realistically American proletarian lower-class lifelike than most animated features usually include. In fact much of the film's comedy, starting with Bolt's own unintended myopia during the first half, is so low-key in funnily suspenseful scene transitions and delayed verbal punch lines that the standard animated movie audience may be taken somewhat aback if expecting constantly bawdy SHREK-like pop-media satire or romantically-/matrimonially-angled narrative sideroads (the Disney cartoon epics of the 1990s and 2000s). Like its little hero BOLT instead constantly keeps its head low and quite honest and is all the fresher for it as the little trio charmingly continues through the American Mid- and South-west and Bolt himself steadily learning his own sadness & disappointment can be offset and made palatable as he learns the value of real friendship and a sensible life goal of his own might see him through. Another successful element is the remarkable range of moods and settings the animators create by juggling sunsets, twilights, and light intrusions in shadowy cramped spaces (much of Act II takes place after dark and I was marveling at how the directors and their visual crew were keeping very strong pace through the lower-key nighttime lighting and compositions with the storytelling; when the action literally explodes at an all-night Ohio animal shelter [!] the resulting screams and chaos come off much funnier like a group of real animals and people were all just woken up and startled into disastrous realizations at the same time right at 3am). It all grandly combines near the end when little Bolt returns to LA just as the mourning Penny is involved with the climactic staging of a dangerous epic fire stunt that suddenly goes awry, and joined by his new friends along with the overtaken firefighters descends into the maelstrom to rescue his beloved owner for real and prove to himself and his audience what he's really made of. Its story elements a little creaky, its voice & star-speeching maybe a little too cut off before the final minutes, BOLT does finally combine its' modest strengths together into a rousing ending in the finest Disney way that bodes well for its new Pixar management and the imaginations of children who will find a little canine hero that they can learn from.",7,0,3,7 January 2009
Gran Torino," Effective & timely if limited Eastwood drama
","Involving yet somewhat slender drama by Clint Eastwood, portraying an elderly Polish-American widower/Korean War vet/auto-industry retiree maintaining what's left of his decaying metropolitan household against the increasing incursions of gangland warfare and immigrant blight. As profanely verbose and insulated as he is leathery and gun-waving, Eastwood's Walt Kowalski has also managed to drive off what's left of his children and religious standing with his baby-faced priest (Christopher Carley), expending his remaining pungent life energies on his constant house/auto upkeep and warning off his Asian neighbors as trespassers. Yet when Walt's deepest bigoted fears occurs as one of the young neighbors is forced to participate in a gang initiation by breaking into Walt's backyard for thievery the event instead triggers shaky and harsh recriminations and explanations between Walt and the boy's family that soon become merely grudging and even welcoming, freeing the multi-generational Hmong family through their well-spoken daughter and interpreter Sue Lor (Ahney Her) to offer her brother as a laborer on any projects Walt needs to make up for the bad introduction. Through time and a lot of cooked food gifts and party invitations from his previously ignored and circumspect neighbors Walt begins viewing them as actual people with their own history of unfair treatment and cherished intra-cultural sustainments. Yet as Walt bears with a suspected terminal disease and trying to introduce the young man to a stronger view of himself through career and dating coaching, some of the local gangs become increasingly aggressive and offended by the increasing warmth and unity Walt's relenting have inspired, and when the group dealing with Sue Lor's brother make him a 'deal-with-us-or-pay' offer Walt's smoldering and deadly protective instincts rebound against the gang into a shocking and potentially deadly confrontation. Reasurringly reflective and gently humored in its first 2/3rds Eastwood is generous and composed here, organizing Nick Schenck's script (from Schenk's outline with Dave Johansson) with its threadbare lower-middle class American flavor and hearty exchanges against the generationally-stacked, commemorative ideals of the Hmong enclave. The sequences are engaging and compelling throughout. Yet I found Kowalski himself ultimately harmless as a protagonist, not because he lacks adequate narrative drive (I've never seen a more powerful shot of Eastwood than when he points a gun right into the camera here) but his actual reach as a bigot is written off only with a line about 'I killed 13 men.', displaying nothing about if or when he willingly also 'killed' the efforts or opportunities of others unlike him to succeed and prosper alongside him at his jobs or within his community (while watching I could envision someone more along the lines of George C. Scott or Jack Nicholson equally understanding Kowalski but taking him into a more strategically-comical or unpredictable patterning). The film's visual technique, commencing with white-hot exteriors and comforted yet undimensionally-lit and spatial interiors soon becoming warmer yet hard-angled and shadowy, provides a highly immediate contrasting balance and suspense buildup of grit and sacrificial exchange that is belied by the earnest yet overly-coercive writing. GRAN TORINO therefore gives Eastwood--if not quite up to the achievements of UNFORGIVEN or MILLION DOLLAR BABY--and his surrounding cast of newcomers and reliable character actors a hard-hitting, eye-level contemporary canvas to explore what has been going on in America's post-Vietnam/post-Industrial era.",7,1,4,6 February 2009
Hotel Transylvania," Three howls out of 5
","(3D viewing) Frantic, kid-friendly, pleasantly oddball CGI-mishmash supervised by comedian/producer Adam Sandler can't quite be labeled as either steadily charming (the expensive voice cast--with the possible exception of Steve Buscemi portraying a flat-headed, rolling-eyed werewolf--appears to be trying too hard, mostly force-fit together by voice editing and constantly abrupt scene transitions) or profoundly unearthly (the monsters deal more in competitive magic and mesmerism than spoofing outright terror). But as Sandler's ingratiating, widowed, porcelain-skinned Dracula successfully weans his teenage daughter Mavis (Selena Gomez) past puberty into her 118th birthday, the cruise-ship-type monster revelry at his Hotel Transylvania resort castle is invaded for the first time by a dreaded, freckle-faced backpacking American mortal, Jonathan (Andy Samberg), who manages to fascinate and charm Mavis into the threat of an actual monster/human romance. Film's middle--as Dracula 'trains' Jonathan into masquerading as a monster to deflect suspicion or anti-human bigotry from Hotel's labyrinth number of creature-guests while hopefully wearing down Mavis' earnest new attraction--isn't narratively smooth but does feature the requisite 'wild' chases, adolescent and familial longings, and character contortions & gesticulations expected of these computer animated films nowadays. Director & former 2D/Cartoon Network animator Genndy Tartakovsky doesn't reinvent the wheel here, and the almost infinitely detailed digital texture mapping on display is second to no one else's. One does have to wonder however if/why either Sandler or Tartakovsky agreed to keep the film's rubbery interpersonal relations, character massings/groupings used solely for punch lines, and juvenile societal identities set rather low even for contemporary animated features (perhaps to avoid the overly melodramatic lecturing some kids' features descend into, if indirectly.) The climax--where a remorseful, fruit-bat-looking Dracula chases down a home-bound, jet-planed Jonathan to bring him back to Mavis and everyone at the resort--provides enough final giggles/smiles to make HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA a genial, occasionally very-well-imaged animated comedy entertainment that--although it may not have gone far enough for real literature-based horror fans or animation critics--will probably be in serious rotation in your minivan DVD player or kid's playroom TV.",6,0,5,23 October 2012
The Soloist," Reporter finds music on the streets-movie version loses the point
","Arrestingly-filmed yet oddly distanced dramatization of LA Times columnist Steve Lopez's (Robert Downey, Jr) series of articles regarding his befriending and increased sponsoring of a failed classical musician, Nathaniel Ayers (Jamie Foxx), now begging for change near several of the city's musical landmarks and during his investigations becoming forced to explore his own societal and interpersonal biases & fears. Lopez appeared to accept from reader reaction that Ayers--swerving between trilled spouting of information and history and self-dangerous descents into violent rage--came through the reportage more believably and immediate when the two went into action together--touring old haunts, enduring rehab, abandoned family members like Ayers' sister Jennifer (Lisagay Hamilton) reintroduced to him yet the encounters brim with recrimination. Yet through the patient and increasing level of support not just from the uncertain Lopez (almost driven to drink or career distraction without the knowing, cheeky support of his ex-wife and editor (Catherine Keener) but from an unexpectedly diverse range of contributors in LA and around the US who register their remembrance of Ayers or admiration of Lopez' remarkable patience and dedicated journalism, the film winds everything through a completely overburdened halfway house in the second half where Ayers himself will make the film's climactic decision on whether to embrace the help of esteemed classical musicians and a stable household or destroy himself in the immense miasma of the LA slums. THE SOLOIST refuses to either take sides or provide easy answers, and to a degree director Joe Wright (ATONEMENT) looks like he could pull the film version's ethically unovert conditions off successfully. Downey and Foxx throughout the film compete with Wright's excessively willful, almost smothering stylization--very hard key lighting and light source spillage, minimalist background staging, profile close-ups and crowded two shots whipped away by breathtaking location zoom lensing, all topped off with a breathtaking hi-fidelity sound mix (the orchestra scenes sound like the mikes were placed right into the bowstrings), alternating with reassuringly traditional lighting and designing of scenes of Ayers' childhood and early education at Julliard. Downey is particularly impressive, seeming to get steadily greyer and more anxious as he guides and controls Ayers' naive remembrances and stocky musical technique into repicking up his beloved cello permanently. As Ayers, Foxx packs a generally believable punch playing a street urchin who was capable of much more, and as the relationship developed I noticed Susannah Grant's screenplay devoting an inordinate--some might say unbalanced--amount of time to both Ayers and the wonky lot of the city's environs, creating understandably large amounts of audience empathy yet tottering a little too trustworthily into the comfort zone of a $60 million dollar big-star vehicle lecturing America about the poor. The result is that Foxx's zombied character conception (the fault may be more Grant's than his, though) lacks either the leavening humor, sociopolitical complexity, and symbolic gravitas (the film version cannot decide if its supposed to be a docudrama or a riveting psychological examination) to humanize him against Lopez and make them a representational force of both their adoptive city or their career frustrations. THE SOLOIST in the end does make for a occasionally striking and formatively well-acted drama but its arch technique and lack of severe social reverberation fails to take detailed advantage of two very fine actors and only partly captures the playful yet deeply haunting contact of an American journalist to a specimen/victim of America's obstinate focus on success and what an 'artist' should be.",6,2,4,3 May 2009
