The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," From great to down right boring
","I knew what to expect from this movie before i watched it because i read the whole book series. i thought it would really suck from beginning to end but I gotta say, i was surprised i enjoyed the first part of the wedding. I felt like crying cause it was just really beautiful :) it was funny and interesting in the beginning, but towards the end, i felt like it was lacking. I wish there was more action to it or more characters if i were to redo the whole twilight series. As always, Kristen Stewart's acting isn't very good but i loved the part where she gave birth. It was really convincing for me. All in all the movie was 'just okay.' It's nothing to be excited about.",6,4,12,19 November 2011
