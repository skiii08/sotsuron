The Ring," Impressive...
","The first ten minutes of this film implied a 'Scream' element however after that the film warmed up substantially.  It was freaky, not horror as in blood and decapitated limbs just psychological good old fashioned 'scary'. It did, however, show a 'Sixth Sense' feel to it but you feel that for all of ten minutes as the rest of the film makes up for it.  Probably one of the scariest films I have seen over the last year (however, not as good as the original) but I highly recommend that you watch this, preferably not alone.IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THIS FILM, DO NOT READ ANY FURTHER:-The ending however was somewhat confusing.  Did Rachel live merely because she had copied the tape or was it because she had copied the tape AND shown it to Noah and in order for Aidan to live she needed him to make a copy AND show it to someone else... a VERY open ending which does make you think, however very impressive and very good throughout.  Well done Mr Director, something different to the usual samey cr*p that has been released over the past few years...",Null,0,0,7 February 2003
