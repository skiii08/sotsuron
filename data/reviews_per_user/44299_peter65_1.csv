Kill Bill: Vol. 2," quite simply brilliance
","After being a huge fan on Kill Bill: Volume One, I was not particularly expecting to be impressed by Volume Two - mainly due to the much rumoured genre change.  Upon viewing the movie, however, my doubts were all set aside easily.Volume Two builds up the characters a lot more, and we begin to understand the motivations each character has much more. We are also introduced to several new characters - my personal favourite of which has got to be The Bride's martial arts master 'Pai Mei', who provides much comedy with the numerous times he laughs and strokes his beard. The music is of course a huge asset to this movie - utilising pre-existing spaghetti-western soundtrack pieces with great effect.This movie was well worth the wait.
