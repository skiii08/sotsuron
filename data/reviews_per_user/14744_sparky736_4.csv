Alien 3," The worst of the series, but still one of the greatest movies
","When i first started watching the Alien series, my dad had them onDVD. i watched all 4 in about a week. I must admit, this was myleast favorite, but I still loved it. I love the ending. It is one of thebest endings i have ever seen, and i've seen a lot of great endings.Now a lot of people dont like the ending because of the thing thatim not gonna talk about because i dont wanna spoil it. I say it wasthe perfect ending to the perfect series. Even though the endingwas great, i still like Resurrection second best. It was amazinghow they were able to create a sequel to Alien3. The whole seriesblew me away. Another upside 3 had was it it was scarier than theothers. A lot of people may disagree, but I didnt found the first onekinda scary, the second barely scary (face hugger scene) andresurrection scare-less. Before you go out and see this movie, seethe first 2 before hand. You'll be completely lost if you don't. Also,dont stop at 3, see resurrection too.",10,1,4,25 September 2002
The Matrix Revolutions," Evidence that 2003 was the worst year for movies.
","Bruce Almighty, Gigli, Hulk, From Justin to Kelly, Daredevil, League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. Who would have thought that a sequel to one of the greatest movies would be as bad as these movies?It got off to an ok start. This movie finally defined who my favorite characters of the series were: Morpheus and Seraph. Then we get to the dock battle. *Bows head in shame* If I remember correctly, the majority of this movie was random gunfire in a giant dome. Wow... what were the Brothers thinking?Just when I thought it couldn't get any worse, Neo goes into the Matrix for the final fight with Smith. This scene, along with the burly brawl scene from Reloaded, had some of the worst special effects I have seen lately. The final battles consists of this: Neo and Smith hugging each other in the air, trying to make it look like fighting. Then, Smith punches Neo into the ground, which would have killed him, but somehow didn't.Say what you want, but let's face it, after the first movie, the Brothers got money-hungry and quickly whipped out two sequels, one of which, has practically no plot. For shame Andy and Larry. I hereby boycott all Wachowski Bros. movies from here on out, if they're stupid enough to make anymore",1,1,2,1 April 2004
Remember the Titans," Rather gag myself with a spoon.
","I don't know if it' my bad history with Disney movies or what, but this movie was a complete waste of time. It has a story line that's too slow and boring. If you haven't seen Remember the Titans, and are thinking about renting it, DON'T!! It's not even worth the 5 bucks, or how ever much they charge at you video place. One of the worst things about this movie is it's got this real annoying song that they sing about every 5 incredibly boring minutes! I would not recommend this movie (obviously) due to boring story line and annoying song.",1,10,23,18 February 2002
War of the Worlds," Nothing Special
","Spielberg once again fails to make a spectacular movie, and I'm beginning to wonder why he's considered to be among the greatest directors of all time.It's not that this film is bad, it's just that it's not good, if that makes any sense. The storyline is average, and the special effects are good, but since when have effects been what makes a movie good?We've got the typical depiction of an average guy as an action hero. The chances of surviving one attack from the alien tripods is slim to none, yet Ray (Tom Cruise) survives five attacks, two encounters with their tentacle-things, and a close encounter with at least three aliens, manages to single handedly take out a tripod, AND MAKES IT OUT WITHOUT A SCRATCH ON HIM! Well he had had some scratches, but you know what I mean.There are plot holes everywhere, and one of the most disappointing endings I have ever seen. I'm not talking about the classic 'bacteria kills aliens' ending; I've always loved that. About half way through the film, the son abandons his father and sister, even after they spent so much time building up his character to be a good guy. The military is attacking the aliens and he's like 'I need to see this!' and, at least during the scene, the both he and Tom are overacting to the point of dread. Anyway, Tom leaves him and as soon as he does, the entire ridge Robbie (the son) was on explodes and becomes engulfed in flames. This all takes place around Connecticut. At the end of the movie, Tom arrives with his daughter in Boston at his ex-wife's parent's house. Everyone walks out, with a nice cameo by Gene Barry and Ann Robinson as the parents. Tom's character is watching, the from behind everyone, comes Robbie. BULL! Not only was there no way Robbie could have survived, but the fact that he still managed to beat his dad and sister to Boston is simply impossible. This scene ruined the feel of the movie for me, and I know I'm not the only one out there.Another problem I have is it's extremely predictable. Then again, what isn't anymore?All in all, this is just a special effects show with an average plot. As far as invasion movies go, I'd have to say Independence Day was better. War of the Worlds took itself too seriously and spent far too much time trying to develop a story, while Independence Day accepted the fact that it wasn't a story and spent more time being entertaining.",6,13,27,30 June 2005
