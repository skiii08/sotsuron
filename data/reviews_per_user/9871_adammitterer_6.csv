Rise of the Guardians," A Cute Movie
","I loved this movie, think it is a cute movie and everyone of all ages would love, this would be a perfect family movie.This movie is about Jack Frost no one can see him, this is because no one believed in him but eventually they do, he was chosen to be a guardian, at first he didn't wanted to be, but after he see his memories he understands why the moon chosen him, he was chosen to be a guardian because he saved his sister.My favorite character is Jack Frost, because I loved everything about, he was viewed as a good guy and not a bad guy.I thought this movie was cute and hope you will too.",8,4,5,29 March 2014
Kung Fu Panda 2," A 3D movie worth seeing
","This movie in 3D and was worth it. This one of my favorite movies of the year this the 5th one I saw by myself. In this one there is a new villain called 'Lord Shen' and he is a peacock and Po the Panda returns in this movie.And Po finds out he has a real father that he never knew about and he needs to find out and he is unfocused on Kung Fu. And he tries to find inner peace to save the ancient marital art of Kung Fu.
