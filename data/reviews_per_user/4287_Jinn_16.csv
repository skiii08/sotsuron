The Blair Witch Project," The Blair B!tch Project
","I had to psych myself up to see the movie, not an avid horror fan at all, they usually scare the smeg out of me! I saw it in the daytime on DVD :)The movie was interestingly done, it's as though you're actually watching an amateur student film. (A tad scratchy and repetitive in parts though) But honestly, again trust Hollywood to give Witches a bad name again ... When are they going to get it through their thick brick skulls that Witches and Pagans are Nature people that have always lived in Peace with Mother Earth? A movie about REAL witches is in order.Also, I felt it was the students' own fear that kept them trapped in the forest. The 'Blair Witch' or whatever evil spirit (real or imagined)that was there was obviously feeding from their fears and that is why they were trapped and none of them had the good sense to figure it out.A tad spooky in parts, but I was honestly more scared by 'Donald Duck's Halloween Special.' ...",1,1,4,1 February 2001
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Beautiful, awesome, a wonderful beginning to this magical epic saga.
","While the original Star Wars grabbed me more, besides the fabulous special effects and spacecrafts in Episode I, what I liked about 'The Phantom Menace,' more than any other Star Wars movie, is Qui-Gon. Liam Neeson, beyond brilliant. He portrayed the Jedi Master so beautifully, his kindness, resolve, his majestic beauty. Qui-Gon, the epitome of what the Jedi should be; a pity the Jedi Council didn't seem too thrilled with his ways. It is Jedi like Qui-Gon who break the rules when they need to be broken that save the Universe both on physical and spiritual levels. If it wasn't for Qui-Gon, we all know Balance in the Force would never come. It is Qui-Gon's gentle altruistic philosophy, his kind heart and willingness to go beyond the boundaries to help others and trust the will of the Living Force, that make this movie better than any other.May The Force Be With You Always.",10,1,3,5 March 2000
Cloverfield," Clover F%@#ed
","Oh My God! (By this way this was probably the only line repeated over and over and *over* in the entire movie  The scriptwriters obviously don't know very many expressive words)An insult to intelligent movie goers everywhere. A disappointing, complete no brainer... I've seen better acting in butter commercials. Hell, *I've* done better acting in the TV commercial I starred in  and I can write better too ... Just look at the pretty young woman who gets hacked by the monster's offspring - hardly shows any pain with such deep lacerations - all the way down her back and shoulders... Either she has no pain receptors or the creature had something in its saliva which dulled her nerves (neither was said in the movie) and the victim later winced when another character was dabbing these bleeding rips in her skin ... Ow. I've been slashed open by a monster. Better get me a band-aid. No, Really? And the girl that they went back to the apartment for? Umm One would think she would have let's see like - **Left Already!!!** Oh my God! There's a huge, mean monster attacking! Slashing, crushing, as it goes, ripping buildings apart. Oh My God!! It's and heading this way! I think I'll stay right here in this apartment block, which is doing its best impression of the leaning tower of Pisa. *Puhleeeeze.*I felt nothing for any of these flat, stupid, pathetic, characters. And reading other reviews, I see I'm definitely not the only one who feels ripped off and my intelligence bashed by this sketchy piece of slush. Glad I didn't bother watching it on the big screen. That would have been worse. See a lot of people liked it though... 'intense thriller ... action packed...' Haven't seen many real action movies, then, huh? Oh My God, I've seen more action (and better acting) in a David Attenborough documentary. Needless to say I'm beyond disappointed that it turned out to be nothing more than a typical, mind-numbingly predictable, utterly boring monster thrash & bash. The only interesting take being the student camera thing ... Maybe they should have called it 'The Blair Monster Project' ... (Though it was in parts, sketchy and annoying. Just like Blair Witch - another boring no-brainer) It takes ages to get to the action, the party scene a complete snoozer ,,, And when something *finally* does happen, you're wondering if it's aliens, terrorists or monsters (I was hoping for something more original). Oh my God. It's devoid of intelligent plot, script, or anything intelligent, period. Where was the monster from exactly - the ocean, but where? Was it originally from another world? I was assuming it was female as it was breeding, (well dropping its offspring like poop), everywhere it stomped. Was it acting on instinct or malicious (could just've as well been some primordial beast without a clue)  though you hardly saw the damned thing, but even then it was probably the best actor in the whole movie. Will say it had good special effects, with Clarice (well somebody has to give the monster a name :)  the explosions and the Statue of Liberty head ... That was probably the only thing in the entire movie that brought any feeling whatsoever. (However not so special-effects to write home or best friend about.) The fact that it was short usually counts as a negative, but with this I was glad when this overrated slag pile came to an end. THANK God! Though I heard they're planning a sequel *Oh My God!!!* Haven't insulted our intelligence enough, I see. (The more intelligent reviewers will understand this as sarcasm.)And then I find out this waste-of-time & money effing hogus sorry a$$ excuse for a movie insultingly ... won the 2007 Saturn Award for best Sci-fi movie  against **Transformers?!?!?** *Jinn shakes her head in disgust and dismay and utter shock ... and barfs.* I'll give *them* a monstrous thrash & bash! ;)Don't waste your money or time on this uber-moronic, un-intelligent piece of over-hyped crud. Want to see *real* thrash and bash?  Watch Transformers. Actually *has* an intelligent plot (and more than just thrash & bash ) and with decent acting (from the humans as well)  And one that has you actually feeling for the characters (Transformers and humans alike), has feel good scenes and *Actually H A S an ending* then save your Energon chips and watch Transformers.",1,1,3,27 July 2008
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Disappointed! (Contains spoilers)
","I hoped the movie would be better than the title.  Not so.  It lacked soul and spirit, the very thing I love about Star Wars.  It was very cold.  I can't believe I disliked a Star Wars movie!  I hope Episode III is better and that George has not lost his touch!   A lot of the movie was boring, the rest, nerve wracking!  The movie had its moments, like Anakin and Obi-Wan in the speeder and Anakin playing with the fruit, was a nice scene.  I liked Obi-Wan, but on the whole I was very disappointed.  What made Episode I better than Episode II?  One word - Qui-Gon ... or does that count as two words?",3,0,1,15 May 2002
Watchmen," Help! Heeeeelp!! Somebody Please!!! Save me!!! And the Bad Guys come rushing to the rescue. The Heroes have left the building.
","Blotchmen! With the exception of Rorschach – the only one with any much substance, this movie stank big time. I thought it would be cool, fun, a Superhero movie with a kick.What we got was blasted and the crap bashed out of us. The movie was a blatant assault on the brain, the senses and the stomach. (And a complete waste of a free movie ticket and 2 hours or so of my life – I'm SO blessed I didn't pay MONEY for it.) WatchFreaks was unnecessarily violent and gory – and I had to struggle to forget about the blood & guts for my ancient Greek dinner that night – I SO wasn't going to let this complete washout spoil my very special $90 dinner. That said, WashOut Men started off wonderfully with the song 'Times they are a changing.' Showing real heroes with real problems and real lives. The fact that the heroes were anything but was interesting and real people - and it sported to be a good movie, but sadly went downhill from there in a Southerly direction.And after the novelty of seeing Mr Manhattan completely starkers wore off, his character bugged me, he's supposed to e altruistic and he's blasting the guts out of unarmed people that had dropped their weapons and were running away - so he knows death is a transition, but what right has he to make those decisions for others?The ending was a surprise, the actually did 'destroy the world' – or a large chunk of it to bring peace, so to speak - so that was an interesting twist - BUT this movie would've been way better sans a greta deal of the blood, guts and brainless violence. At least Rorschach's journal tells the truth.Our so called heroes seemed so happy to get out of their spandex and lead 'normal' lives and then they couldn't wait to don their costumes again, save people, in Lori's case, flick their hair in the face of a blasting backdraft, kick the crap out of a few nondescript bad guys (and since when do heroes actually *kill* street punks?) That scene was so tagged on. Then the 'heroes' couldn't wait to get out of the lycra again to bang each other Lori (Silly Spandex Girl) was a brainless bint who could never make up her mind finally toward the end she grew a brain cell when she really realized her power and feelings for Mr Penis.The useless jail scene could have been completely cut out, (save the audience more wasted time) - yet another excuse for more blood and gore and Silly Spandex Girl running about, hair flicking in the jail break. It was also disappointing to see Rorschach's human face then - Would have been *much* more powerful to only show that at the end. Oh well  At least in the end, Mr Potato face and Mr Dicky found their peace.Despite this, I did enjoy my dinner thank you very much. I may not look good in spandex or have long, perfect silky hair to flick in the face of imminent danger, but I do have the power of inner strength, stamina and being true to myself and do not need to hide behind a mask.",1,6,15,16 September 2010
Transformers," Working title: 'Michael Bay's Transforming Robot Movie'
","The Good- LOVED Optimus. Peter Cullen's voice gets me every time. Had good-fortune of meeting him at BotCon '97. Lovely fellow. Bumblebee cute, but different, a grown-up kick-a$$ Bumblebee...thumping the VDub was rude. Sam rubbing the dust from the Autobot symbol...Ooo. Cool how the dam looked like Sherman Dam...Ahh happy 80's memories. Starscream's entrance, awesome (poor Bumbles) The vending machine dude, cool. Coke kills... Loved the different storyline, (But not how Cybertron was destroyed & didn't look good) Liked it better than TFTM-It didn't kill everyone we loved. Hey we know Megatron's coming back. Loved the sound score. The effects, awesome, action spectacular. As much as I love Golden Compass, TF's effects were superior. Borne getting the sound Oscars? This'll teach Bay to omit Soundwave.The Bad: 1) What stupid tool goes to see Transformers for humans? I liked Sam, SoldierBoy, Michaela... Hated the Hackers, Sam's muggle parents & creepy Sector7? Scenes could've been woven in for more screen time for the REAL starts of Transformers. Sam/Michaela should be Spike/Carly (Michaela's the girl form of Michael. Bay even messes the humans.) Or call the hacker Carly, wearing original blue suit. I'm Australian, but her accent was wrong for the film. I'm glad TF was filmed here. We got it before the US. (They should've digitally erased the Harbor Bridge in the background though...) Spoiled viewing pleasure. Great posters spoiled by 'Their War. Our World.' Again - We go to see Transformers for the Robots. If we wanted to see humans we'd go to the shopping mall.2) The Decepticons! No, they're not the bad-where oh where were Soundwave, Thundercracker & Skywarp? This was SUPPOSED to be a G1 movie!! If Bay watched the series, he'd've seen names, colour schemes & heard the voices. None of his other G1 named characters were G1. Some voices sounded disjointed like a Terminator rip off.The Ugly: 1) Megatron! Don't blast me! I care not Bay wanting a new look, (the fact that Megs sounded different oddly worked) Hugo did a wicked job. 'You failed me yet again, Starscream...' Ooo shivers. Ahh the good 'ol days, back on Cybertron...Megs was cool, but a version of Megatron, not the REAL one. If the Wizards at ILM wave magic wands, say 'Feraverto,' transforming 1984 Optimus into new Optimus, there's NO reason they can't for Megatron. I've heard arguments of Frank Welker's voice not being right. WTF?! Is this TF or Bay's ego trip?! I heat They asked Frank to phone lines in. He didn't get a studio appearance--clearer & with decent voice changing equipment there would've been no problem. Sigh...takes a fan to think of these things.2) Optimus Prime's mouth-plate down...Planet of the Apes look did FA. 'Good Grief!' A bizarre tribute to Optimus Primal? That's just Prime!...Not!3) If Starscream saw it, he'd up-chuck his Energon. His robot mode looked like a friggin' ape. Jet mode cool, (though I adore the original F-15) I hope his 'I live to serve you, Lord Megatron,' was sarcasm. If not, Bay, you've a lot to learn.Ratchet's eyesore colour scheme...There's Ratchet & Starscream toys in movie & G1 colours, another Bay money scheme. Not happy, Jazz! (An Aussie joke) The robots had expressive faces & voices in the original. I realise some VO actors have crossed over, bless them. At least Bay could've made the new actors emulate the characters close to the original. Fans can do better. No offence, Charles Adler, great G1 Silverbolt, but they could have made him do Starscream more G1. The battle scene? I'm wondering who the slag's who. Very embarrassing-- hence Bay, a lesson here--COLOUR SCHEMES!! Maybe he's colour blind? Optimus, Bumblebee & Jazz- correct coloring. Jazz, spiffy mode, miss the Porsche but Pontiac Solstice cool! But he sounded terrible. Ironhide looked like a gorilla & the voice of one to match. Did Bay write TF after watching King Kong while roaring drunk? Now all's said and done, I loved having a new TF movie, seeing people TF mad, playing with toys, wearing the clothes like the 80's. I hear the next one's to have more robots, including Soundwave. Barricade?? Not even remotely G1. AT least Bay's taken the hint putting Arcee in, realised there be girl fans, did you? What of Elita One & Thundercracker!? Movie style toys of them exist, why no presence? At least Thunder has the right colours, but hulking robot mode leaves a lot to be desired. The Seekers were slender in the original series. Perhaps by TF3, Bay'll realise he's making TRANSFORMERS, established characters and fanbase. If he wants to do robot movies, fine, but if you make Transformers, you make Transformers.As much as I've panned, it had its cool, funny moments and a great atmosphere. Prime was firm, but gentle, but kick-ass, just like the old days. I liked the way he treated Sector7 like obnoxious kids. Calling Megatron 'Brother' made me cry...I knew it was Megatron who would fall. (Without spoilers/ reviews) Optimus' ending quote was inspirational. *Hugs Optimus.* Go away, Bay. I'm not hugging you...Well if you do Megatron, Soundwave & Starscream right & put Thunder in. It was great how Starscream escaped at the end. Optimus saved the Universe & didn't die. That's a first...so I don't completely hate you, Michael;) Prime saved a piece of the All Spark, interested how this will fare & hope Jazz'll be fixed. You can't kill the tooth fairy! Let's hope there be better voices, colour in the next & that Soundwave looks & sounds right or I'll go ape...*Jinn Holds up scorecard* Peter as Optimus, a TF revival, visuals & action- 10. Too many humans...minus 3 ...Voices/colours wrong minus another 4.As for girl fans, one argued Sam was cuter, the other SoldierBoy. They asked me who I thought was best looking. And I told them... Optimus!",3,2,4,6 April 2009
Pi," Pi in the Sky
","2 for interesting premise. Minus 8 for the brain-bashing screechiness, patchy camera-work and unfulfilled message.I had to put this movie on mute several times just to get through it, having sensitive hearing. The movie attempts to be profound, but sadly falls short and leaves one wanting. Stuck through it to learn more.Disappointed.Even though after my third year of primary school I loathed maths with a passion (*adored* it up until then) I have learned of profound mathematical symbols, in the 'chaos' and the beautiful synchronicity of these symbols, occurring everywhere in the Universe.Sadly this movie seemed to have more chaos. Sad as I usually dig oddball, independent movies. (That said, in substance it's a damn sight better than most of the so-called blockbusters these days like Gi Joe, etc...) but sadly, Pi leaves a lot to be desired and needs to be more grounded and solid.I felt for the character in the movie, having mental challenges myself, sadly Pi and the religious propaganda, (At least it was Jewish for a change) was annoying,mostly boring, took ages to get into and just when it appeared it be going somewhere, it became boring and repetitive again, then a tidbit of interest when they mentioned sacred mathematical symbols in nature, then it goes screechy, arty-farty, then boring again and just when you're thinking, get to the F---ing point! The credits roll up and you're like ... Yes? ... And? Perhaps it was meant to leave one pondering. And so I am. Pondering why this highly recommended movie I've heard do much about and *finally* got a chance to see - pondering ... Why?... It could have been so much better and much more profound and go much deeper than I expected from this one.Goes to show recommendations and awards aren't all they're cracked up to be.",2,5,8,16 February 2011
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," CLEAR! CLEAR! CLEAR! Sadly even Dr Cullen's best efforts could not save this awful addition to the Twilight Saga... And also the Voilturi do NOT approve!
","Even as a devoted Twilight fan I was DISGUSTED by this movie. It was rushed in both parts, they had more than enough time. What happened to Alice's fashion sense? Bella showed an awful dress in her lovely cottage and said Alice picked it out. I thought Alice was supposed to have a good fashion sense. This was forgivable, however the atrocious ending was not. I hated AWFUL the fight scene. It ruined the Twilight movies completely. Devastated at how they portrayed Aro, making him so evil. Take him OUT of that godawful, hideous military uniform. Rigid, ugly and mechanical. Aro's supposed to be elegant and flowing. Put him in something sinister, yet elegant, like a black waistcoat with a silver dragon, or silver and gold snakes. Did Summit actually *read* the books? They also ignored the canon that Alice can't see the future when it involves the wolves.Carlisle and Alice were portrayed badly. Alice can see the future and would *know* bashing Aro into the air would not make him a happy camper. Carlisle would *know* attacking the Volturi would spell disaster and way out of character. That said, I still adore the actors. There's only so much fantastic actors can do with awful, stupid scripts. The characters were written into a corner. The Cullens and Volturi are my favourite Twi teams so I'm 'Team Switzerland!' They were portrayed two-dimensionally. Stephenie Meyer wrote deep, meaningful, complex and insightful characters. I hated how they were squished into black and white Hollywood molds of good VS evil. I have never felt so betrayed in my life. When I saw Stephenie's name in big letters as producer, I felt relief that the movie won't be wrecked. So much for that. The Volturi are antagonists, rather than 'bad guys.' Stephenie even admitted later, the battle was too one sided and unrealistic that mostly the Volturi died. Why wasn't this amended in the script writing phase? Fans deserved a way better movie.Edward and Bella seemed flat in the fight scene. In the book, Bella came into her own, realising her powers without resorting to violence. The saga revolves around Edward and Bella, whom I adore, but that does not mean the other characters have to be ruined especially when that severely deviated with how they were written. In the book it was *Cauis* who smiled when the Denali coven's mother and immortal child were killed, *not* Aro. In the book, Caius wanted the others killed. Aro declared they were innocent and spared them. This scene was conveniently omitted from the movie, making it easy, lazy and convenient to make Aro the bad guy. I was also upset to see very little of Carlisle. I especially wanted to see the scenes with him rousing Edward and the scene at the end where he was even prepared to forgive Aro. I adore Carlisle as he's so sweet and kind and Aro as he's so peppy and when I saw a poster of him from 'New Moon', those deep red eyes, I fell in love with him because he needed love.The 'fight/vision' scene was an interesting twist, however to stay truer to the book, it should have been Caius who started it as he wanted to in the book, attempting to spark the other side off by killing Irina. This would've been another twist as the others are waiting for Aro to start something and it's Caius who shocks everyone (including Aro!) If Hollywood *had* to have a fight, it would have been better if Aro had tried to stop it and in the end being the only one who survives, perhaps with his body guard Renata and learns something about how to use his power wisely and relieved it was a vision! The fight scene made me sick, numb, betrayed and powerless. Portraying Aro way more crazy and evil is not a good thing for those suffering from mental challenges as it only serves to spread the fear that we're all violent psychos, which is not the case. Things like that increase being hurt physically and emotionally and finding it even harder to be accepted in society. My Aspergers has been a challenge as well as a blessing and has definitely made my life very interesting and very painful and I don't want to go around harming people. It makes me more insightful and open-minded and I would not trade those special insights for the world. If anything people like Aro, who in real life, are like frightened children who need nurture, love and understanding. This move hurt me so much and so deeply, it's been very hard to write about it and post until now.I'd love to have the money to remake that scene into something that is much truer to the books, much deeper and more meaningful. I am envisioning Summit re-thinking that movie and be a forerunner in Hollywood for breaking that typical mold. Perhaps they can re-release the entire Twilight Saga at the movies with extra footage and do it as a huge charity drive.They did a good job with the other movies and the costumes (bar some of the *awful* things they had Bella in like her birthday dress and prom outfit) I just wish with all my heart and soul that they had not ruined the entire saga with how they cheapened the charters and made the ending very clichéd in BD2. I loved the scene where Renesmee touched Aro's face and he softened and we saw a gentler side to him.And yes that awful military suit made Aro look fat ;) A least I still have my sense of humour after all this... Yes, Aro knows I tease him. As long as it's meant in fun, You're allowed to tease the ones you love. That's the Law. Even Caius will tell you that ;)",1,4,7,10 April 2016
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Enchanting, Magical (Contains some spoilers)
","I got into Harry Potter before all the hype.  A story about an ordinary boy who discovers he's an extraordinary wizard ...  I gotta get into that!  I decided to read the first book before the movie came out to formulate my own impressions - and I ended up reading all 4! Even though there was more in the book than the movie, most of the characters in the movie were exactly how I pictured them.  Hermione even *sounded* like I pictured her! I can't stand all the religious controversy. There is no evil ulterior motive. Harry and friends are good wizards fighting the evil Voldemort and his nasty cronies. It's about good versus evil and the good coming out on top. It teaches children to be good. When you see children dressed up for parties they're dressed as Harry and friends - not Voldemort! As a white witch myself, I practice magick in my daily life for good, peace, harmony and abundance, and to honour the Earth and the ancient ways.  I never use magick for evil, harm or to manipulate others. Although the magic in Harry Potter is make believe it is encouraging to note that people are realising that good magic is not evil. I have seen the movie and read the books over and over.  There are characters who the children can relate to and characters who the adults can relate to, like Professor Snape.  He is a very deep character who on the surface seems mean, but there's much more to him than that.  Alan Rickman plays Snape perfectly. How many people thought Snape was the evil one after the stone? Even I did at first, but I am rather proud of my deduction when I worked out it wasn't him. It's a pity there are no magical schools like Hogwarts! The Harry Potter series helps people realise that they are special, and believe in themselves and their own special magick even if they feel ordinary.",Null,0,0,21 May 2003
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Revenge of the Fans
","Or at least it will be...Joining 'Death to you Michael Bay'FanClub. I stand by my review of TF1. Did this EarthGerm ever *watch* the show? See it for my views how characters should look & sound reminiscent of their 80's selves. Optimus still looks like Optimus, so iconic, even non TF fans know who he is. Surprised with Spielberg on the job the other robots didn't look better. *Very* disappointing. I've mixed feelings. Let's start the other way around.The Freaking Ugly... The Fallen grossed me out. Megatron & Starscream. AWESOME in G1, now look like Terminators Skynet never talks about. And WTF with Megatron's feet!? Thought Bay worried about 80's TF'S looking chunky. Needn't've bothered. They already do. G1 Megatron has big feet, but They're cool, nowhere near as ugly & chunky as in 'Fallen'...G1 Starscream actually had sex appeal! Optimus? I say again! Mouthplate, Bay, Mouthplate!! Must I beg like Starscream?! The Baaaaaad & Stoopid: Devastator's whirlwind looked cheesy. Much voice-over work was disjointed. Optimus sounded different, not as good. Many characters-couldn't tell who's who, no intros, then they're blown up, sliced & diced before you even get to know them (Like poor Sideways...And Sideswipe was all cool about killing him? Some Autobot.) 'Revenge' had more robots, but zilch character improvement. They even stuffed Optimus. Prime does NOT kill without a shred of remorse, or has no other alternative and even then wouldn't revel in it. I know Prime- don't blame him for bad scripting. Even in the first movie, he said he had no choice and called Megatron 'Brother.' Nor would Bumblebee crush Ravage, perhaps thump & render him sore & unconscious. Why do all 'bots that come alive with the All Spark turn into bad MF's? Again, where was Thundercracker? More robots, new ones, why not more originals? Took ages to get into the movie. Where were the promised Femmes? We see them speeding about, Arcee speaks once, then gets blown apart:( Their robot modes were silly, badly done as well. And Bay was worried about the G1 characters looking cheesy? The Blue one was Chromia, but I only found that out after when I saw the toy. Was the other meant to be Elita One, like the first movie toy? If so, nada mention of her & Optimus amor. Very disappointing on the Femme front. I don't count that Cyber-Slut, if it even was female. (But can I have that green dress...;) Bay seemed more interested showing off metallic testosterone, quite literally in Devastator's case. Idiotic fans say it was awesome & those looking for plot & good characterization should've looked elsewhere... A good movie by an *intelligent* director has ALL that and more. That's what the original had-So why can't TF movies have all that & then some like they should? Now THAT *would* have been AWESOME! These morons obviously have equal maturity to Bay, as someone said, a 12 year old ogling Play-Boy...PlayBot in this case & squealing like a cheesebot at Devastator's 'Decepticles,' a fan put it, or giggling at Michaela's cleavage. Man if this was the first I'd ever seen of Transformers, no way I'd be so taken as back in the 80's. RotF left me cold, unsatisfied. Bay's movies have less charm than an enema. And what on Cybertron was with Megatron!? (At least they didn't go the Galvatron road) He didn't have the expected presence. Flailing about as a sappy lackey of the Fallen? WTF?! Sickening. If the REAL Megatron ever sees this, he'll fire Bay quite literally. 4 words: MEGATRON HAS NO MASTER.The Good, Interesting & Funny: The Primes and their mission, that they'd been here before. Despite originals getting the sad Bay treatment, I liked some new characters, The twins were cool, more modern (for me it didn't seem racial, but I can see reading other reviews how it could be seen that way), the kid in me loved the cussing in a TF film...Jetfire, the crusty old dude was awesome- in keeping with how he switched sides as he felt more suited to the Autobots. (Even if different from Skyfire) I loved the story of the Tomb of the Primes, the Matrix, Sam's test, ancient symbols adding mystery, how they came to Egypt...I hope they rebuild that pyramid. (Gigantic robots in ancient places, y'know there's gonna be restoration in order. They still need to rebuild those Incan Pyramids from Energon...) Were the Pharaohs were inspired by the Fallen's headdress? Simmons got better, not such a dweeb, had a backbone after all. Sam's parents were more realistic. I loved Soundwave. Upon seeing the action figure, I feared the worst. What is it with Bay's obsession with the chunky 'gorilla' look? Despite looking different, Soundwave's calming voice worked, came across nice & clear and his satellite mode worked for the Communications Officer . (Frank's 'Dr Klaw' voice suited the darker demeanor, rather than Soundwave's melodical voice which mesmerised me. Well characterized, like in G1, in the background, running the show. Liked Ravage, very sleek. Bumblebee was cool, more grown up, awesome action scenes. And funny moments...Judy being 'Green,' Resurrecting Prime with that 'pixie dust...' The twins' antics & Jetfire's 'Oh B0ll0CKS...' He's quite a character and I'll miss him. Maybe Prime'll even forgive Bay-one of the soldiers said he weighed 10 tonnes. (He's actually 65 or was in G1;) Crash diet? (eep, pun sorry;) Car & jet modes cool. Transformers @ Midnight was awesome, too bad I wasn't 13;) Loved the interplay between Megatron & Starscream, very G1, taking me back, (even if short-lived & having to imagine them looking & sounding right)...So, I don't *completely* hate you, Bay;) The movies spawned new generations of TF fans & that's a good thing, even if you gotta tell 'em what the REAL Megatron is like;) Gods, I feel like Jetfire...'In my day, Sonny...' Hehe.I hope the next one be better, if not, that's what fanfic/art & imagination be for.",2,6,15,21 July 2009
August Rush," The music is all around us. All you have to do is Listen.
","What can I say  This movie moved me to tears and I hardly ever cry in movies. My mother and best friend also did not have dry eyes by the end. I can see it had mixed reviews. It seems the people who hated the movie really must hate miracles or anything that is remotely beautiful or magical. They obviously have never heard of or even understand there is such a thing as Universal serendipity. They have obviously never heard of 'Music Ophelia,' a term for those who have a very special, even sacred connection with music and it takes us to other worlds... lifts us to new heights of awareness... August had this, (I have this) -they *obviously* do not. One reviewer went who hated it went on to say he saw a lot of people outside the US loved it and that Americans obviously were more discerning - what an insult to non Americans, of which I am one (and to intelligent Americans as well). Perhaps viewers liked him (US or not) hated August Rush as there were no explosions, special effects, CGI beasties and the like. Perhaps brainless crap like Gi Joe: Rise of the Cobra will be more his scene. Discerning indeed. Perhaps people like him discern anything that makes them think, (ie their brain hurt). Sad that most moviegoers these days have their imagination beaten out of them by movies that leave NOTHING to the imagination. Movies like 'Bridge to Terabithia' hurt their brains if you read the reviews. Interesting that movies like this get bad reviews from the same kinds of people who would not be able to imagine their way out of a paper bag. Very sad and damaging to humanity as a whole. Or perhaps people like them are like Robin Williams' character in the movie, they had this beautiful music in them and it was beaten out of them, and they're bitter & twisted or have become flat and lifeless. Very sad indeed. I'd rather be dead than lose that music deep within. So those people have a choice, find your inner music, reclaim it or for all intents and purposes you ARE dead. And the only one who can revive you is YOU. The more people who awaken and re-awaken in this world, the more alive, awake and aware and full of joy this world will be. So open your eyes, your mind, heart and soul - or shut your hole. What right have you to stomp on someone else's dreams because you let your own slip away, or you never had any? Get off your arse and make a difference like those who make movies like this one. If not you are part of the problem, not the solution to making this world a better one. The time is NOW.August Rush was magical, beautiful and spiritual on many levels. The music melded together with such chemistry it was really beautiful. Augusts Rhapsody raised me to new levels of awareness He literally heard the music of the Universe and brought t for us to hear, the music of the earth, the country, the city and the people. How could people NOT see or hear this So sad that movies like this are wasted on those like the reviewer above, people like him really make me sad. This world is hard enough without cynical like him making it harder for those who really WANT to make a difference.However it is heartening that there are those, like myself with the courage, imagination, strong will, stamina, belief and determination to transform this world into a better place in whatsoever makes their hearts and souls sing.The music is all around us. All you have to do is Listen.",10,1,2,18 July 2010
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Better than Episode II ...
","A better title than Episode II at least, and a better movie. This one had more feeling to it, though it wasn't as good as Episode I. The movie was sad in parts when they killed the Jedi, but that's the way it happened, so it had to happen, I guess. Hayden was great as Anakin and better looking with long hair! Though I felt sorry for Obi-Wan when Anakin betrayed him, but again that's the way it happens as the story goes. I was disappointed how the scene with Qui-Gon and Yoda which was in the book was not in the movie. At least Qui-Gon got a mention though. That was really good. I muss him Qui so much! Perhaps the Qui-Gon/Yoda scene will be in the deleted scenes when the DVD comes out. We can hope! On the whole Revenge of the Sith was a good movie. *Off to view episodes 4,5And 6 now!*",6,2,5,22 June 2005
Sherlock Holmes," Sherlock Holmes and the Depraved Adversary
","Wasn't sure what to expect as I'd avoided all spoilers & reviews... I've been a fan of Holmes for quite a few years now .... And ... I loved it... Fast paced action ...... suspense, thrill, humour and some serious whup-ass.Robert Downey Jr was great and played a very interesting Holmes, (not stuffy and perfect as he's often portrayed), not to mention his awesome ability to kick-ass. Jude Law played a wonderful touchy-feely Watson and Mark Strong, deliciously depraved as always, an awesome choice for the sinister Lord Blackwood. I hope to see Mark in many more flicks to come. I wish we'd seen more of him in this movie, however his absence added to and built intrigue and suspense. I didn't like Adler too much - her character was somewhat boring and predictable.Overall, cleverly done with mystery and intrigue it worked very well. It was a wonderful tribute to the great detective and his keen mind and overly alert senses. The scenes between him and Watson were brilliant and the tension he and Blackwood bad between each other held one on the edge of their seat.I wonder if Blackwood somehow managed to 'magic' his way out of it at the end... it certainly looked like the end for him, but looks can be deceiving - especially with Sherlock Holmes of all things and Blackwood's so deliciously wicked it'd be a shame and a waste to off him after just one movie that's begging and screaming for a sequel. After all, with Moriarty sporting to be in the next, it would be interesting to have Blackwood's revenge including both the Great Detective *and* his Nemesis...If not, I guess there's always fanfiction... ;)",8,1,3,26 December 2009
Prometheus," The Gods are ANGRY. Very Angry Especially Prometheus.
","It is told in the ancient legends that the Greek Titan Prometheus gave mortals fire (and was punished by Zeus.) Perhaps Prometheus can once again light a torch for humanity, but before he does so, place the torch near his titanic arse and let loose a thunderous fart on this travesty of his namesake.Not for the first time I'm wising IMDb had negative stars. 1=awful. -10=GODawful. Don't you *hate* it when a preview looks interesting, then gets predictable and when you finally see said movie out of that spark of interest it turns out to be even more shite than you expected? Thy name was Prometheus. The movie, that is, not the Titan who thought having his liver pecked out every night was preferable to this stuffed turkey which pecked out his brain (someone also said that in their review about their own liver.) The movie soon went to Tartarus, then went further. Last seen heading rapidly even more south.Perhaps that very same eagle or aliens ate Ridley's brain? Oh well they say you're not a director unless you've made at least one flop, 'cept this 'soufflé' didn't just flop, it was burnt to a crisp and had to be put out with a fire hydrant (courtesy of Prometheus), set those accursed beeping smoke alarms off and stunk the house out for days.Another reviewer mentioned a stab at Scientology. I'd believe that. If it'd starred Tom Cruise I would have checked out (or not checked in in the first place) Good thing I hired it on DVD and like when I watched 'Cloverfield' (another predictable godawful sci-fi travesty,) spent more quality time cutting out pictures for my vision board. And they promote the DVD had extras, sit through it AGAIN with a commentary?!?! *Squeals with laughter* A crying shame the whole damned moved wasn't a 'deleted scene' or was that a goof? When I first started watching, I thought it was a pathetic Alien/Event Horizon rip-off, not a great prequel. The one redeeming thing was Fassbender was great as David and it was Liam Neeson I believe who said you're not an actor unless you've done one major flop. The movie's only other saving grace was it was a clear warning against biological weapons. The rest of the cast, wooden and boring and Noomi although pretty and an somewhat interesting and naive, but also boring character is a poor actress - some scenes she's supposed to be crying and she looks like she's giggling like a schoolgirl. And who runs about like a mad sale shopper after a Cesarean, even if it is set in the future with more advanced equipment? And poor Charlize? Her character was a b!tch, but surely didn't deserve that!! To see Pro-meep-theus had 120 pages of bad reviews at the time I wrote this, doesn't make me feel so bad. The fact it had 59 pages of good reviews is staggering to any intelligent life-form. And there's a SEQUEL I hear??!?! What the feck??!! You gotta be sh!ttin' me! What in all the worlds is sci-fi coming to? The real Prometheus has left the building! Sorry, but sometimes something must be said. This movie was an obvious, lame attempt to frighten people of 'what's out there' and ooo! If we search for answers 'out there,' look what eeeevil, nasty horrors await us!! We'd better pick up our crosses, grab our bibles and go to church! The religious connotations may have been subtle for some, but for me, stuck out like bulldog balls.Truth is, the unknown should always be approached with caution, but approached nonetheless as if it were not, we'd still think the Earth was flat and everything revolved around us. The church came up with those too Nuff said? (When the ancient Greeks, Egyptians and Celts knew the Earth was round (and according to 8000 years old Indian and Greek texts that we lived in a 9 planet solar system, though the planets were not named until much later and I doubt the Greeks would have had the hubris to debunk Pluto.) Exploring (our external and internal world) is how we learn and grow.Perhaps almighty Zeus can send eagles to peck out the livers of the producers of this piece of primordial goop and give real writers and unfairly impoverished artists a chance to shine with their intelligent creative endeavours.Sh!t, I've NaMoWriMo'd stuff heaps better than this! And have ideas for movies that leave this for dust!",1,10,15,29 January 2013
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Beginning: Excellent. Ending: Awesome. Middle: Slept through it in my coffin.
","Adored the beginning, HATED most of the middle; LOVED the end.Brad, and Tom were wonderful as Louis and Lestat. At first I thought Tom's face would be too familiar, but he was awesome, and the blonde hair helped :) he brought so much passion to the role and Louis, the struggling vampire, much like Carlisle Cullen's struggle at first with his vampirism in Stephenie Meyer's Twilight Saga. And so I felt for both Lestat's passion and Louis' struggle to come to terms.However, for me it went downhill when Lestat turned that child. At first I felt sorry for her, but she became such an annoying, obnoxious BRAT, she made me wanna hurl. I understand how angry she was at Lestat, but in the end he trusted her and look what she did  and then the movie got really, really boring, too long, drawn out and tedious, apart from the scenes with a decrepit looking Lestat coming rightfully so for revenge, and of course the dashing Armand. Loved the battle scene near the end with Loius and the Scythe and I was not sorry to see Little Miss Molly Dolly burnt to a cinder (finally) however I did feel for Louis. I've not read the book, but if I do, I'll read the beginning skip the middle and devour the end. That said, I think Kristen Dunst played the child (Claudia) very well. Somehow I knew Lestat would return in full and he didn't disappoint. No, he's right. He needs no introduction.So Interview with a Vampire  Part II - Enter LestatInterviewer: 'So, Lestat Now you're finally back in the game, are you planning to turn any more children?'Lestat: 'Good God no ... and the Volturi will probably get the sh!its...'",7,0,0,15 March 2010
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Rolling out for the last time. HAD it with Brainless Bay.
","After the last two, I wasn't holding my breath for Dark of the Moon and just as well. Yet *again* Michael Bay falls short of what Transformers should be. It was never about the humans, it was the story of the Transformers. In Bay's movies the Transformers take a back seat. There's little or no character development and he still hasn't worked out what Transformers look or sound like. And Bay can't even get the characters right. No way is that sorry bucket of bolts Megatron and if Megatron was that decrepit, Starscream would have taken full advantage, blasted him and taken over. In the original G1, the Decepticons were not such ugly, chunky and messy robots and since when do Transformers slobber? Gross. In the original movie when Starscream died I bawled my eyes out and was upset for years. When Screamer bought it this time round I couldn't give a high flying frenzy. Bay is a greedy money making bozo who could not give a stuff about the fans or the characters we know and love. Where was Optimus Prime's compassion for all living things? Loved Megatron's 'Lawrence of Arabia look' Gods he was having a bad hair day. Where were the female Transformers who got an almost non existent cameo in Revenge of the Fallen? Carly spent most of her time being duped, running scared or running to her man. Very sexist. She had a few good lines with Megatron though. The only other woman with a big role was Mearing, a snotty, stuffed-shirt, full of herself bitch. The antics at Sam's workplace were beyond ridiculous. Only Bay with his brains in his nethers could have come up with such tripe. Simmons, a little better in this one is still a dweeb and the last line of the last Transformers movie is him?! What an insult!It had an interesting premise, but as with the other two, fell short character wise. Bay's movies are bereft of the magic that Transformers once had. Gone is all the original charm. Well at least they called the girl Carly. But what I loved about Carly in the original series (despite not being in many episodes) was that she was not a supermodel and slightly dumpy, which made her real for me as I hardly looked like a supermodel either. In the original show she was also American (not that I have anything against the Brits - I'm half pom myself) but they should stick to the original, but then seeing how Bay's f---ed everything about Transformers that was special, I wasn't surprised. Bay's movies were noting but a huge let down and mega disappointment. In 2007 and 2009 I bought heaps of Transformer toys and merchandise, which I wish I hadn't. I was trying to re-live those childhood years where it brought me so much happiness and joy. That joy no longer exists with these new movies and it's very sad. This time around I only spent $15 on some TF office stationery and a box of TF chocolates and that was it. No point in lining Bay's already overloaded pockets. I certainly hope what goes around comes around for him for what he's done to Transformers. Sadly the younger generation do not know the original and therefore do not have a reference point to see how badly Bay has messed up Transformers. I really feel for them and for what Transformers has become thanks to Bay. And Spielberg should be ashamed of himself. Won't say that a-hole ruined my childhood (like I'll give that pathetic Earth Germ that much credit) I cherish my G1 moments. What I don't get is why Transformers movies couldn't be made this time round with the characters looking and sounding right, with good character development, heart and soul of the original and enough CG action to make it uber-exciting and an unforgettable Oscar winning epic like Lord of the Rings. On a lighter and happier note, I hear Bay's been ousted by Hasbro and good f**ing riddance. Sad that Hasbro even hired that dorkus molorkus in the first place. Hopefully in the near future we will have a team of intelligent directors and writers that will write that epic that the Transformers and their loyal fans deserve.Actually, over 10 years before Bay got his grubby, greedy, dirty little hands on Transformers, I had an idea for a live-action Transformers movie, but sadly didn't have the money, connections to contacts like he did :( Goes to show those who deserve to have money and power in this world, sad that many of us don't. Very sad. My story stayed true to the G1 characters, with much character development, an interesting story with many twists, turns, heart-stopping effects and action, (and a real looking Carly) coupled with much heart and soul which Bay lacks period. Sad as it would have shat all over that carbon based microbe's deploringly abysmal so called 'blockbusters.'Sadly, Transformers, like Megatron in this flick have definitely seen better days.Rolling out now.The Transformers have left the building.",2,5,12,1 July 2011
