Black Swan," A good movie but not because of Portman
","Well I just got back from the cinema and it is a great movie (that is if you like Aronofsky's movies). It was like a nightmare with ballet, I liked it but at some moments it was disgusting. About Portman... well I felt that as an actress she was just like her role, an artist, who doesn't find herself in this movie at all. So I'd recommend seeing it for her just if you'd like to see her almost naked a few times... Vincent Cassel on the other hand was really great. I loved his character I really belived everything he did on the screen. All in all this is a great movie but, my personal opinion is, that Portman shouldn't have gotten so many awards for her role.",9,0,1,21 March 2011
Tangled," One of the best new Disney movies
","Well I just saw the movie and it was like going back to my childhood. Really i felt like when i first saw Aladdin (my first movie experience) It was funny, the songs were at place and generally i liked it. I won't say anything about the 3d as I watched it in 2d (I hate this 3D hype). About the animation... well sometimes i felt Rapunzel's hair was a ribbon (kinda hard to describe, but it was definitely weird) but other than that it was good (although I myself don't prefer animated movies) So all in all, I felt like a child again some moments were touching others really funny (the bar scene was hilarious) so I'll say this movie felt like a classic Disney movie (and when i say classic i mean the classics from the '90s like aladdin, lion king, so the Disney movies i grew up on)",9,3,6,11 December 2010
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," My opinion: BORING
","Well tonight I went to see the midnight premier of HP7 (I live in Hungary)and I just got home. I waited so long for this movie... I wanted to have an expression of a HP movie without reading the book... So I bought the book on the day of release but never had read it (till know). OK maybe less is left out from the book but I found myself looking at my watch and asking 'come on when is this gonna end?'. A few hours ago i was hyper-excited about this movie, but after seeing it I felt 'well, not a bad movie bet not a good one either' So this is just my own opinion but as a viewer who does not know the story I felt bored an it was way too slow. Also I'm about to read the book and I'm planning to see the movie again afterwards, so if i have the opportunity I'll write another review from the perspective of a reader.",4,1,4,24 November 2010
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Best sequel ever!
","This is the BEST sequel ever made to a movie! Terminator was a great movie but T2 made the whole thing one of the best movie franchises ever. I mean who wouldn't know the quote 'Hasta la vista Baby' One more thing about this masterpiece. It has the best use of CGI i've ever seen. The CGIs looks great (not for just its time i find it appealing even now the t1000 looks great) but the great thing is that CGI is not overused like in films nowadays. All together i think this movie got it all right, great story, great action scenes, lots of explosions, great cgi so yes it is one of the best movies ever and i still think this is the best sequel!",10,5,6,27 September 2010
