Captain Phillips," Good, Solid Entertainment
","Based on truth, pirates off the Somalian coast hijack cargo ships and hold ships captive for insurance money. Sad, but true - it still happens now, it is often cheaper (in money) for the ships to pay the Ransom than sail out of the way. The owners of the ships, crews and pirates all know this creating a very dangerous environment.Tom Hanks plays the captain of such a ship. A normal guy trying to fight off young kids who are given AK-47's and a few pennies for their efforts. Since the merchant men are unarmed, it's an unfair battle, but Cpt Phillips uses his wits and what few resources he has to save his crew and ship.I found the movie to be balanced - it presents all sides of the problem; the crew who are put at risk, the Capitan and even the pirates. The ending is rips your heart out. Hanks really did an excellent job there.",7,0,1,5 March 2014
Gravity," Entertaining Visuals
","On the plus side, a lot of excellent special effects and scenes in this movie. Bullock does a very good job with a somewhat limiting script/dialogue, but creates tension & terror when needed.Clooney is Clooney. A charmer, surface deep, wise-cracking character.There are images that make you think of Sigourney Weaver in Aliens, 2001 Space Oddessy and the very end scene which really was bad.***Spoiler alert*** Bullock emerges from a pond and crawls to the beach - really? Hit the audience on the head with that allusion of rebirth and a second chance.There are 'liberties' taken with the physics involved, to a purist that would be bothersome, but for the average viewer such as me, I can deal with that. It's good for 90 minutes of entertainment.",6,0,3,5 March 2014
Memento," Best seen backwards
","I've seen this movie twice in the original format (backwards) and once in the chronological sequence. It is much better as released in the theaters, because it really keeps you involved, trying to figure out who done it, what happened, what is going to happen (opps, you already know that).OK, how he got to where he is. This is probably one of those like it or hate it types with not much room in between. Seen in the theatrical version, you don't realize at first who is helping who and what is going on. It takes several viewings - or, you can read multiple reviews and then watch the movie (if you have the two disc set) in chronological time). Then, it really becomes much more clear. Still OK as it is, but I prefer the intrigue and mystery. I agree with some folks, the constant cuts back & forth do get tiresome, but there is a reason for it all. Well done. Shows how directing & editing can change a movie...and perception...and memory....and reality...which is the whole purpose of the exercise....and entertain.",7,0,1,20 February 2011
The Irishman," Mobster Mash
","This is one way to condense every single mobster movie since Godfather into one film. It's not a good way, perhaps a mini series would have been better. The pacing is so slow it is torture.It feels like the writers were tired, the actors uninspired. I read Joe Pesci had to be begged out of retirement for this. Unfortunately for him, he did not say no one additional time. None of the stars here needed to make this film for the money, it seems like they all got together and said why not.Just because you can do something (ie, de-age-ing) doesn't mean it's going to be good. Especially when the script is so cliched, tired, predictable. At least Joe Pesci's character did not yell.When you feel like you've watched something that is six hours long (twice it's real length) that's not a good thing. Very glad I did not pay to see this.",1,4,16,3 December 2019
Pirate Radio," Light, Frivolous, Fun
","I thought this was going to be more of a 'schock jock' kind of movie - more like Private Parts. I did not know there were pirate radio boats/stations outside of England in the mid 1960's.If you try to approach this movie as real history or a realistic approach to pirate radio boats, you'll be disappointed. This movie will also not knock you out with startling new emotions. It can be predictable or clichéd, it has been done before - the heck with authority, we love sex, drugs rock and roll, youth and rebellion against the establishment. But I did find humor, and it is fun to side with the rebellious quasi hippie types that are on the boat blasting R&R.I enjoyed the movie. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is at his best playing an oddball, cast off from society. Think of this as a pop corn movie, a feel-good experience. It's loosely based on truth, so you can root for the 'good guys' and be pleased with the outcome.",6,1,1,29 October 2010
The Expendables," Collection of over aged action stars
","Jason Straham is the only redeeming thing about this movie. I felt bad for him. Obviously, he wants easy money and more recognition. He looks pained throughout the whole movie - or is that look one of guilt for having agreed to be in it? Perhaps he had a clause in his contract that the movie could not be shown in his native land? I generally like action films, and understand pop corn films. But this was just awful. Stallone cannot write a decent script - and since he directed and produced the movie, it's his fault. Over the hill action stars - Bruce Willis, Mickey Rouke (who I have never found good), The Govenator, Arnold, of course, Sly himself.Some over the hill athletes refuse to retire - same can be said about these actors. Cheesy, predictable, unrealistic, and those are the good qualities. Yechhhhhh.",Null,12,25,23 April 2011
No Man's Land," Dark Humor, Anti War Movie
","Not many movies made about the war in Bosnia which ended back in 1995. For many people, that war is now ancient history and who understands what happened anyway? This independent film tackles all of the tough subjects - the human cost of war, the pointlessness of it (who started the war?), neighbor against neighbor.There's a bit of M*A*S*H, Catch-22, political satire (at the expense of the United Nations), criticism of modern headline grabbing media. People who try to get involved and make a difference sometimes make things worse. It's a dark satire of war, not a action movie.Some of the scenes are not realistic - the wounded walk and talk around as if they had scratches. Some of the things they do are silly. But the movie overall ridicules both sides. The ending makes some people mad, but the point is real. This is a good expose on war, one well worth watching.",7,0,3,1 September 2009
Invictus," Moving, powerful and true
","What makes this so much more than just another Cinderella/underdog sports story? The timing of this World Cup Rugby match. I don't pretend to understand Rugby, and you don't need to – it's really about how Nelson Mandela, soon after being released from prison, seizes an opportunity to use Rugby to help unite South Africa.After years of repression, apartheid, white supremacy rule, the Blacks had elected Mandela as their new president of South Africa. Both white and black radicals wanted revenge, power – violence was breaking out. How to stop it? By using the very symbol of white racism – the Rugby team – Nelson Mandela gave everyone something they could support, a cause to rally behind. It ain't crazy if it works, and this actually worked. He got the blacks to see the rugby team as belonging to all of South Africa, no longer something that only the whites would watch. Morgan Freeman does a superb job portraying Nelson.What makes this book work so well are the characters behind the history. Of course the successful change from white rule to free elections was made possible by more than just a rugby game, but this movie shows how many different approached Nelson Mandela used to ensure peace. The focus is on the people - the game, the politics and strife are more in the background. ** Possible Spoiler** This is still a Cinderella story, but rather a very compelling piece one where the stakes are much more than a championship. Very uplifting and motivating, that in of itself, makes for a good entertainment.",7,1,1,24 August 2010
The Wrestler," Incredibly BAD
","I am amazed at the positive ratings here. There is nothing new in this movie. It is a washed up pro-wrestler version of Rocky. In fact, it makes Rocky look like Shakespere. I feel sorry for Marisa Tomei. Mickey Rourke playing a washed up bum. Now, that's a stretch. This is a non stop cliché fest. Bad, bad, bad. Depressing without redemption or shedding any new light on any of the subject material or characters. A dark film (meaning they used no lighting on the sets)with only one reason to watch - Marissa Tomei. I still feel sorry for her. Some people say Mickey Rourke has talent, but I have not seen it, nor will I think you find evidence of it in this movie. There are so many other good films out there, please do not waste your time on this.",1,27,55,1 September 2009
Inception," Very entertaining, great visuals
","I think you have to enjoy the abstract, appreciate the artist Escher and are not annoyed by is this reality, a dream, an illusion. Is this my world, or am I a dream in your world? Does it have plot holes? Of course! It's science fiction! Does it have similarities with the Matrix series? Yes, it also has incredible special effects. Is this the most intellectual, mind blowing movie you'll ever see? I don't think so, but I was very entertained by the combination of the special effects and the plot was good enough that I'll watch it again.I'm not overly concerned with what Director Nolan set out to do -is he trying to be an artist or make a statement? It doesn't matter to me, I enjoyed this movie. It's far better than just a blockbuster popcorn film, but it has a lot of action, explores the concept of reality and while I won't loose any sleep over it, did make me go, hmmm.",7,0,4,22 January 2011
Defiance," Very Compelling
","This movie really captures what it was like to take a stand against the Nazis in WW2. All of the emotions are there - hate, anger, disbelief that friends and neighbors turn on you. Revenge, brother against brother, hope, love, the will to be free. Sacrifice, hardship, death.Some tear this movie down because of the accents or lack thereof. It doesn't matter because this is not a history film, it is an inspirational film based on truth. Are there clichés in this film? Yes. Is it the best movie ever that shows the hardships of the Jews in WW2? No. But it is different in that it shows how a small group of determined, often afraid, average people made a stand and in the end, a difference. The movie shows the enormous burden of one man who has to be the leader of these strangers.********Possible Spoiler****************** It also shows that even the best intended people (Daniel Craig) will take revenge and when pushed enough, will fight for his beliefs. And that these ordinary people, when given a chance, will sometimes revert to savagery. I think this is a well balanced voice of a very important time in our history. Recommended.",7,0,2,1 September 2009
RED," Space Cowboys meets CIA
","RED (Retired, Extremely Dangerous) has an all star cast of, um, veteran actors who are cast as super spies who have been put out to pasture reunite to save the US from super villains. It is a way, way over the top outrageous parody of spy thrillers and cold war movies.Bruce Willis survives an assassination attempt against him, kidnaps Mary-Louise Parker and is off to save the world! It's ridiculous, funny, one liners going back and forth, predictable, campy and a lot of fun to see some of these older actors get together. Bruce is Bruce, if you've seen him in any of the Die Hard movies, you'll know the character. John Malkovich, Richard Dryfuss, Morgan Freeman are all funny. Part of the fun is just seeing who's in the movie. I did not know Ernest Borgnine was still alive, but there he is! Mindless fun, something to laugh at as much as with.",7,0,0,11 May 2011
The Thin Red Line," Wrong War
","I remember seeing this in the theater when it came out. I just re-watched it on DVD. Anti-war, yes, it is. Artsy, yes. What bothers me the most about this movie is that it is really a Vietnam war movie, characters expressing anti-war and anti-authority sentiments not found in WW2. If these actions and characters were set in Vietnam, I'd rate it higher.But it is not. I've studied WW2 for over 30 yrs and been in the military. Soldiers did not refuse orders back then. They rarely do so now. Yes, soldiers learn of the horrors and waste of war.The Japanese did not surrender in WW2 as depicted in this movie - they killed themselves or made banzai charges, but they died rather than surrender. The battle scenes lacked realism, the explosions looked like something from the 1960's. The terrain doesn't look like Guadecanal. Soldiers were terribly thirsty but back then they 'manned up'. Colonels didn't have friendly chats with Captains to get them to attack. They gave orders and it was done.Anti War and the horrors can be depicted in much tighter, shorter scripts than this. I agree the director was self-indulgent and is vastly overrated as an artist.",1,78,139,9 December 2009
Law Abiding Citizen," Requires Suspension of Disbelief, but still good
","OK, it's not a perfect movie in that it requires a huge leap of faith that someone could pull off these stunts. But, it is still a very good movie providing entertainment, good acting and does make you think.Good guys vs. bad guys, the law vs. morality, vigilantes seeking revenge against the criminal system gone wrong. Reminds me a bit of the Dirty Harry series. I agree with other reviewers who have criticized the ending. But I still recommend it as the movie is based on cases that have happened, there are very solid arguments about our judicial system being broken. The bonus features go into this in more depth, which adds further interest.",7,0,0,28 April 2010
