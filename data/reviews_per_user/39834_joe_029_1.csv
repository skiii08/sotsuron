Hereditary," Finally!
","Rosemary's baby, Psycho, shining. I thought that the babadook had brought horror back, to the true thought provocation that the horror genre deserves.Hereditary exceeded all expectations! Truly horrific in the true sense of the word. Shocking, dynamic, visually spectacular. I am filled with a spectrum of emotions throughout the film. Sorrows, shocks, surprises, hate, pitty, understanding.Really a must watch for those that can understand darkness. Appreciate the absolute uniqueness of film.",10,2,7,8 October 2019
