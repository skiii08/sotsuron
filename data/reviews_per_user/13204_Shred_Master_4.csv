Kill Bill: Vol. 2," One of my least favorite Tarantino films, unlike Vol 1.
","OK, so I know that kill Bill is meant to be one film all together but it ended up that they did two volumes, which are very different, so it makes sense to review Volume 2 on its own.Without saying too much about volume one, it is one of my favorite Tarantino flicks - the action, the dialogue, the music, the acting, etc. I remember being very excited about volume 2 coming out, then it didÂ…It's not that I mind Tarantino going in another direction per se but everything that was awesome about volume one, he completely changed for volume two. The first thing that I noticed right away was the music. The score and the soundtrack for volume one fit every frame perfectly. For volume two, I felt the music was very off-putting. The action is volume two was very much toned down. It's not that there wasn't any action but the few action scenes that occurred were nothing compared to the spectacle in volume one. Even the final fight between the bride and Bill, was very quick and very unsatisfying. These were the two best fighters in the story and yet, most of the back-and-forth was simply a conversation. Tarantino is known for his dialogue and the final moments didn't disappoint in that department but if you're telling a revenge story, it's kind of like going through a video game. Each opponent gets tougher and when you get to the final 'boss fight,' it typically is and should be the hardest, longest and requiring the utmost of your skills. It seems like, for this arc, he went in the opposite direction.One of the biggest problems I had though, was the fact that I couldn't help feeling that Bill in the end was right. Let's face it, what the bride did to him was pretty messed up and she did it to the very person that she knew wouldn't just let it go. She left pregnant with his baby, changed her identity and married someone else. Did she really think he wouldn't track her down? Did she really think that if he did find out, he would be OK with ending it like it was? She was either really stupid, or very arrogant. Either way, Bill being a 'murdering bastard' or not, he was completely justified in his actions. It was hard to sympathize with Beatrix in the end.I know that there are a lot of people that hold this movie in high regard but I don't get it. This movie left me very disappointed in how he ended what he so masterfully set up in volume 1.",5,1,2,9 July 2017
Baby Driver," One of the best movies of 2017
","This movie didn't really get a whole lot of hype. I think I remember seeing the trailer maybe once in the movies and I'm a frequent movie goer. Thankfully though, it was a success, financially and critically.The story is of Baby, an expert car driver, who is paying his debt to a shrewd businessman (Spacey), who overseas a heist operation. Baby doesn't talk much but he carries one helluva stick, his driving skills. The movie is also all about the music. Just about every scene is shot in a sort of music video style, with all the action and movements of the characters going to the beat of the particular song that's playing. Baby was in a car accident as a child and got permanent tinnitus, so he always has music in his ear to drown out the ringing, which is why we as the audience hear a lot of music. The song selections are absolutely perfect and eclectic.The chase scenes are shot really well and manage to capture the intensity of being in a car that's moving fast, without the use of shaky cam or edits ad nauseam.The cast of characters is well put together. The lead is relatively unknown but he does a good job nonetheless. Then, you've got Jon Hamm, Jon Bernthal, Jamie Foxx and yes Spacey (yeah, I know it's cool to hate him now but you can't deny his acting chops).Every time I watch this movie, it gets better. I don't know why there are so many low star reviews. It was a fun, adrenaline filled blast of a ride.",10,0,2,22 February 2018
Mother!," A decent drama that turns into...a religious allegory?
","So, we all know how divisive this movie was when it was released. After finally seeing it, my thoughts are a bit like the film was, all over the place.It starts out simply enough. Jennifer Lawrence's character is working hard to repair her house from, well they don't really tell you but you find out later, while her husband (Javier Bardiem), a famous poet, is struggling with writer's block. Some unwelcome guests drop by, because they think it's a hotel, rather than a house. It turns out, that's just barely scratching the surface. More and more guests come by as more drama unfolds. Then, after a tense standoff between husband and wife occurs, as if on cue, they conceive a baby. During her pregnancy, she has to endure the constant flow of strangers at the house. Then, a deadly family battle royale among the guests, a rave, a war battle and a SWAT raid all occur within the confines of their house. That's when you realize that there is more going on than your eyes are telling you.The moment happens when the baby is born but Mother's happiness is short lived, as the baby is plucked from her, offered up to the guests and devoured. This is the moment when I said ok, what is the point of all this? Really? Understandably, Lawrence is enraged and starts killing the guests, leading to the penultimate moment where she causes the house to explode, killing everyone inside, except for her and her husband. Then we see him carrying her, lying her down and taking her heart out, which is supposed to represent the last thing she has to give, her love. Then the house resets and we see her wake up again, the same way the very beginning of the movie happens.So of course, I had to look up what the heck this all meant. I am not a very religious person and I haven't been to a parochial school since I was a pre-teen. It turns out, this is a retelling of the story of the bible. Bardiem's character is God, Lawrence's character Mother Nature (now I get the 'Mother!' title), the first batch of houseguests Adam and Eve, the baby was Jesus and so forth. Now that I understand the movie, I have to ask, why did Aronofsky want to do this movie? I also understand now the animosity from Lawrence that led to their breakup, 'can we not talk about Mother? I would like to talk about something else for once!' Yeah, it wasn't a good decision to do this. I can understand that the more religious demographic will think this is brilliant but I find it disturbing for the sake of it. Don't get me wrong, I am a horror movie fan and I don't scare or disturb easily but I think he just wanted to put together horror elements, while excusing them by saying, 'oh, it's just the bible.' If it was just a slasher flick, it probably wouldn't get all that much attention but because it represents the bible, all of a sudden it's brilliant, is nominated for Oscars and what not. I don't buy into it.I think at the end of the day, I would have enjoyed it more if they just stuck with the drama between the husband and wife and the houseguests and not went off the rails with all the horror elements. I understand that would have defeated the purpose but again, why would anyone want to do this? It's not interesting and it just makes all the disturbing content seem cheap and pointless. Either be a drama or be a horror movie but don't use religion as a base, because it's rather, as the British say, daft.",6,0,1,5 February 2018
John Wick: Chapter 2," A rare case where the sequel outshines its predecessor
","So I really enjoyed the first John Wick. Of course they made a sequel, because Hollywood just can't resist. I didn't expect Chapter 2 to be nearly as good, much less surpass the last one but lo and behold, they did it.John is the same assassin we saw from the first movie. Again, he is attempting to live the retired life and again, the rest of the world just won't let him. He doesn't have trouble adjusting back to being the living legend assassin he is known for, of course.Fair warning, the first act is a lot of build up. It opens with an action chase scene but you might feel like it's not that impressive, compared to the intensity of the action scenes we saw in JW1. Then, the movie takes a little while to get him back in the swing of things and in killing mode again. Once he arrives in Rome though and he is on a new assassination assignment, all hell breaks loose and it's loads of fun non-stop. The action scenes are longer and even more frenetic this time around. They also stepped up the gore. There were quite a few people in the theater wincing at a good number of the death scenes. So be warned, you might not want to bring the young ones. This is not for the faint of heart. This is a pure popcorn, shoot 'me up, turn your brain off, good time action flick. The film makes no apologies for what it is and in fact, it revels in it. Sure, there are some things that don't make sense. Sure, there is some subpar acting. Sure, it is not a movie for everyone but really, they know their target audience and with the movie holding steady at 90% on RT after being in theaters for a months and then some, it's safe to say their audience is pleased!",9,1,3,18 March 2017
