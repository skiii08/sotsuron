Requiem for a Dream," Follows the lives of a few people as their lives are driven out of control through drug use
","The movie is incredible.The cinematography is absolutely amazing - the first few minutes of the movie really present the artistic genius of the director. Split-screens, something i have never seen before in another film, worked wonderfully, giving the audience two perspectives on the same situation. The split-screen also worked well during the intimate scene between the two lovers - you can tell the screen is split, but the screens connect so well that sometimes you are left to wonder.The acting was very good - you really get pulled into the movie through the acting, which is not really overdone but not really underplayed, either. The script helps to make the movie more believable and more realistic.The score is amazing, but slightly repetitive. This is one of the only downfalls to the movie, in fact, is the repetitive blaring towards the end of the film. It is used nicely as a way to show how horrific everything has become, but at the same time it takes my concentration away from the situation and towards the music's annoying blaring.Overall, an absolutely great movie, and one worth watching. As far as film goes, this is a choice movie.",8,0,1,22 February 2006
