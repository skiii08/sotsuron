Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not the best Star Wars movie, but it's okay
","This movie's decent, but like a lot of people say Lucas kind of got too caught up in special effects. The acting for the most part is good, but it just needs a a bit more plot. The original star wars movies are better, but this one's good enough. 7/10.",Null,0,1,17 August 2002
Beauty and the Beast," Beautiful and Heartwarming.
","An enchanting tale of inner beauty. This classic Disney magic and one of their best movies. I like this one a lot. The animation is good and very smooth. The acting is wonderful and so is basically everything else. I personally believe this should be higher on the list, but that's my opinion. 9.5/10.",Null,0,0,26 September 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," A terribly hideous movie.
","I already commented on this movie, but the more I think about it the worse it seems. I cannot even accept this as a star wars movie. This movie is just absolute crap. There is not one good thing about. First of all the acting is terrible. Hayden Christensen was such a terrible pick for Anakin. He was the last person that should've been picked. Natalie Portman was a lot better than Hayden, but she still has plenty of room for improvement. Samuel L. Jackson and Ewan Mcgregor were pretty much the only good actors. Now on to the dialouge. The dialouge is usually the worst part the of Star Wars movies and it is atrocious in this movie. To top it all off, there was almost less of a plot in this movie than in episode one. Basically everything in this movie couldn't have been handled in a worse way. The movie would be slightly better if Mace Windu fought Dooku instead of Yoda. Like I said in my other review the Yoda fight scene is laughable. Umm, why the heck would Yoda need a cane if the next minute he bopping and jumping impossibly well? I have to give this movie a bad review because it is one of the worst movies I've ever seen and George Lucas really needs to get someone else to write the dialouge. In episode five he had someone else do the dialouge and that is the best of the whole saga. To finish this movie is abysmal. 1/10",Null,0,1,20 August 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Keeps getting worse
",*Minor Spoiler* George Lucas continues to ruin the star wars saga. This just isn't a good movie. First of all and most annoying the dialogue sucks. This is the worst problem of the movie aside from the fact that there is almost no plot. And the whole Yoda fight scene was laughable. Worst Stars Wars movie yet. 3 of 10,Null,0,1,13 August 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," This is a great movie.
","I hadn't even read the books when I went to see this movie, so I had no idea what to expect. This movie is a breathtaking masterpiece. The acting is very well executed and the effects are stunning. Despite its long length it stays interesting and entertaining during the entire movie. I can't say enough good things about this wonderful movie.",10,1,1,12 August 2002
Spider-Man," a great movie
",This is the best superhero ever. The acting is good as are the special effects. All the actors are convincing as the characters they play. One good thing is the movie actually has a plot. It's not a stupid plotless action movie. I didn't like the green goblin's costume or how webbing shot from spider-man's hands instead of using a web shooter. Other than those problems it is a good movie.,Null,0,0,13 August 2002
Dumb and Dumber," hilarious
",This movie is one the funniest movies I've ever seen. This rivals Austin Powers. I love this movie. I've seen at least 7 times and it's still very funny. Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels are great together. The jokes have become classics to me. This movie is absolute hilarity. I'd give a 9.,Null,0,0,22 August 2002
Rocky," Masterpiece
","I love this movie. Sylvester Stalone's performance is brilliant. The budget for this movie was about a million, but god did they do a lot with only a million. The great music has become classic. Everyone knows the tune. It's just one of those things everyone knows like how the jeopardy music goes. That final fight is spectacular, truly showing Rocky's determination to go the distance. Beautiful movie making. On a scale of to ten, definitely a 12.",10,0,0,25 October 2002
The Sixth Sense," great movie
","This is a great thriller. I like that you actually have to think to understand and like the movie. It's not some stupid movie where some guy is running around killing people. There's much more plot to this movie. Also, the acting is very good. All in all, this is a great movie. 9/10",10,0,0,20 August 2002
Princess Mononoke," The best animated movie ever.
","This masterpiece should be no. 1 on the animated list. Shrek and Toy story 2 were great movies, but they can't compare to this. The animation is great, the voices fit perfectly, the music is beautiful, and the plot is intriguing. This is hands down the best animated movie ever. 10/10",Null,0,1,21 August 2002
