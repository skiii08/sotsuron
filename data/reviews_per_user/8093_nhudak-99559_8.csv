Casablanca," A must watch film that everyone needs to see.
",If you haven't seen this movie then you are missing out on one of the best films of all time. The scenery that is presented in this film are simply gorgeous. The lighting in the nightclub gives a cozy feel to it. The nightlife in Casablanca itself feels so lively since the nightclub that is owned by Rick Blaine is always filled with people. Not only that but the characters in the film have character development which is something I am always glad to see in films. You feel as though you just want the main characters to be happy by the end of the movie. Which is sort of what happens but I'll leave that for you to find out. But by the end of it I'm sure you'll be glad that you decided to watch this film. Because it is something you won't be disappointed in.,10,1,2,15 December 2015
Citizen Kane," It's simply terrific.
","Now I've heard about Citizen Kane for a long time. I never knew what the film was about even though it has been referenced to so many times in the media. The only thing I knew about it was the infamous 'Rosebud' scene and that is it. Other then that everything else was a complete mystery to me. And after watching the movie I can safely say that it deserves all the recognition that it gets. What I simply love about this film is that it simply is going and discovering the life of Mister Kane. Just who he was and how he got to where he is. And the great symbolism in the film with the first and last scenes will make you wonder why you didn't think of that being one of the answers to the question, what is rosebud? Either way it is one film that everyone needs to see at least once in their lifetime. Because if you don't you'll be missing out on something amazing.",9,3,4,16 December 2015
Taxi Driver," 1970s New York is a chaotic place.
","Now, I have heard for a long time that Taxi Driver was a great movie and that it was something that I had to watch. I never seen anything from it except the most famous scene 'You talking to me' but that is it. But after watching this movie I am amazed at the work that Robert De Niro put into this performance. I don't know why but I just wanted to keep watching and see where things were going to go. Especially during the scene where Travis is buying guns something as boring as that I just couldn't stop watching. Other then that this is a film that now I have seen. I tell other people to go watch it as well cause I know they won't be let down. If you're in the store buy it on Blu Ray cause you want to be watching this in the best picture as possible.",9,1,2,18 December 2015
Apocalypse Now," Without a doubt one of the greatest movies of all time.
","For me War movies had always had a special place in my heart. I remember watching them as a kid and becoming so influenced by them that I would pretend to be a soldier for hours and hours. I loved the action that were in these films and they always were able to hook me. However, when I watched the Redux version of Apocalypse Now there was something different about it that made me fall in love with it by the time the credits had finally started to roll across the screen. The fact that the redux version had been almost over three hours which is something I love to see in a film. For me that says that they wanted to be able to tell the story as long as possible without having to take anything out. Instead of watching an action filled, guns shooting, bullets flying war movie like with something like Saving Private Ryan or Black Hawk Down. What i found was instead what to me seemed liked the psychological break down of a United States soldier in Vietnam. I won't go into any more details that could possibly spoil the movie for you reading this. If there was any film that you had to see this would be it. Those last 15 minutes of the movie are without a doubt the greatest moments of the film. The music and scenery are just so beautifully done. It amazes me just the type of work that Francis Ford Coppola is able to make. And i'm glad that I finally got around to watching it.",10,0,1,16 December 2015
Patton," Rommel, you magnificent bastard I read your book.
",As someone who is planning on enlisting in the armed forces I wanted to get an understanding on just who Patton was. Sure I could see any sort of documentary that talks about him but it wouldn't have had that same impact I felt after seeing this movie. George C. Scott does an amazing job of portraying Patton as who he is. A man that loves the smells and tastes of war. Each scene is as memorable as the last. The opening scene in particular where Patton gives his speech is one where I feel I am in the audience actually listening to. I feel a part of the drama and the action. If you are a World War 2 or history buff you're doing yourself a disservice by not seeing this film. Cause god dam was it good.,9,1,2,18 December 2015
The Graduate," An unrealistic love story but still a good one.
","After watching The Graduate all I can say is, this is an over the top love story and I love it. Now, with this film I didn't know what to expect going into it. I thought it would be about a coming to age sort of movie where we would follow our main character as he tries to figure out what to do with his life after he has graduated from school. But was I so wrong. The issue I have with this movie is that it changes half way through the film. What was first starting off with our main character having an affair with a married woman and keeping it a secret. To then go out and try to marry her daughter. Honestly there was no real reason for the daughter to become the main focus in the film after going half way through. It would've been more interesting if the movie had our main character exposed that he had an affair with a married woman and then have his life go down the drain. Then see him try to recover from it. I'm not saying that I don't enjoy the movie because I really do. I feel as though the direction it took could've been done differently. Plus there is so much Simon&Garfunkel songs that I can take until I find it annoying. Either way i recommend that you go and check it out to see how it all ends for our college graduate.",8,0,0,16 December 2015
Singin' in the Rain," This is the film that will change your opinions on musicals.
","Now, before watching this film I never really cared for musicals. I just thought that musicals were bland stories where the characters would just go and start singing terrible songs every five minutes. But with Singin' in The Rain there was something different about it. The songs that were sung in this film were enjoyable to listen to. Each one had a certain characteristic to it that fit each scene well. And the colors in this film all look amazing. They're so vivid that your eyes will always be focused on the scene. And I must say the one scene where they are thinking of ideas with the studio president is without a doubt the best part of the movie. It does drag on for longer then it needs to be but nonetheless it was still enjoyable to watch.",9,1,3,15 December 2015
Psycho," The most memorable horror film of all time.
","Alfred Hitchcock astounds me as to how well he is able to deliver horror in such a way that to the modern day viewer can still send shivers down your spine. With psycho there is more to the horror then simply jump scares. There's suspense and anxiety that the audience feels while watching this because they see what is going to happen with the characters in the film yet they don't. What did bother me however was some of the cheesy scenes in the film that I just couldn't help but to laugh as. Such as, where the murderer kills one of his victims at the top of a star case then he proceeds to fall down them. Its clearly obvious that he is standing in front of a screen and he is standing up flailing his arms around and being over dramatic. Other than that I couldn't find anything wrong with the film. For this being considered Hitchcock's best movie you need to do yourself a service and go check it out.",9,0,1,16 December 2015
