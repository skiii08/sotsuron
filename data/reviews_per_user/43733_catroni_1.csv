Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Quentin's best feature
","I will say it right away: I was sceptical about Tarantino and always viewed him as talented yes, but overrated. It seamed he never had a style that really stood on its own, but rather based on the cinema he had been watching since a kid. He was an excellent recycler (the best and what I truly liked of him: never tried to hide that he was referring and sometimes copying some of his mentors.)Still, I couldn't wait for Kill Bill. And I enjoyed it very much. A lot of violence, yes. But unreel and not to be taken seriously. But in my mind, this film was a B-movie. One of the best. Along with memorable films such as The Killing(Kubrick), Touch of Evil (Welles)... and Pulp Fiction of course.Then came Volume 2. I was infiltrated in the picture and felt the magic in every scenes. Uma is unbelievable as is Caradine. As I watched this unforgettable film, I now understood why this film was separated from its predecessor: The tone is different, and so is the ambiance. Vol.1 was a Samurai picture, this one is a Spagetthi western. The editing is also great, because some of the scenes that could have been unbelievable, were believable because of the way the film was constructed. It reminded me of 60's cinema, and the intro reminded me of 40's film noir.With Volume 2, Tarantino actually polished a genre that have not been taken seriously for a long time: The B-Picture. He could have sell his soul and do typical Hollywood pictures, but Quentin has a quality that most Hollywood filmmakers don't possess (besides Burton and a selected few): Passion and dedication for the stories he wants to tell... and no compromise.",9,0,1,19 April 2004
