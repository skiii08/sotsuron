The Legend of Bagger Vance," Strikingly photographed!
","'spoiler' in the first paragraph!I recently saw this movie and thought it was fairly good, since it showed the way a golfer could change his frustrated life because of another person's wise advice. I just couldn't believe that a person like Bagger Vance (amazingly played by Will Smith) was the one who made Junuh (Matt Damon) win and get ahead in life. Junuh thought he lost his swing, but he really found it after talking to Bagger Vance. Will Smith was outstanding in this movie, he really envelops himself into the role. I never thought he could act like this. I don't understand why he didn't get an academy award nomination for best actor in a supporting role. Anyway I think he was great in portraying this strange character.As for Matt Damon and Charlize Theron, they give a nice performance, they really carry out their roles as director Robert Redford wanted them to be. Have a look at the cinematography; it's thoroughly gorgeous. Just look at the beautiful landscapes. That's why I liked it! Perhaps I also liked it because I used to play golf when I was younger, so this movie reminds me of this entertaining game. Overall, Robert Redford has made an interesting, but simple movie with splendid green fields. You'll probably like it if you are a fan of golf. 7/10",Null,0,1,17 February 2002
Requiem for a Dream," The most impressive and painfully realistic movie I've ever seen!
","'Requiem for a dream' has certainly been the most unexpected and impressive movie I've seen. It left me speechless; I never thought there would be such a movie like this one related to drugs and stuff like that. Probably many movies tell about drugs and their hazardousness; however this movie doesn't only tell about them, it also shows them in a way that I really can't describe because the shots were quick and breathtaking; nevertheless, I consider the quick shots quite unnecessary since it only disturbs the viewer and make the viewer think they're subliminal messages. Those shots also seem to hypnotize the viewers and make them intrigued how the characters will end. The portrayal of Sarah by Ellen Burstyn is completely believable that you would think it's actually happening, her facial expressions and the way she convulsed were impressive. I'm glad my sister and I learned that those pills that are supposedly good and make people thin and stronger are extremely evil and can drive you insane as we saw in this flick. I'm sure it's the most challenging and amazing performance that Ellen Burstyn has given. It was even better than the one she gave in 1973's the exorcist (The second impressive movie I've seen). I didn't find Jared Leto's and Jeniffer Conelly's performances that convincing because it seemed to me they overacted. It really looked like they were both led by the director to scare the viewers instead of making them know how hazardous drugs are. This movie has really impressed me enormously, something that many movies don't do to me often. It shows sadly what many drug addicts go through. It was a very realistic movie; sometimes we don't know anything about drug addicts and live in a fairy tale without realizing that there are horrible and painful times for others who do drugs. That was the message that the ending left me, which my sister and I considered necessary for our life.
This movie must be a tool to be closer to God and thank him for all the things we have and also to protect people from drugs. 7/10",Null,0,1,29 June 2002
The Ring," Naomi Watt's second triumph!
","After her pitch perfect emotionally devastating performance in 2001's 'Mulholland Drive'. Naomi Watts comes up with another triumphant film, which is 'The Ring'. Although 'The Ring' is not as powerful and inspiring as 'Mulholland Drive'. 'The Ring' deserves the highest possible accolade as well.The direction is simply superb. Once you see this movie, it gets its hooks in you. I saw it at midnight about two months ago, and I thought I'd fall asleep, but I didn't. The story was so clever, that it doesn't let people close their eyes for a minute. The opening sequences are excellent; you really understand the story once you see them. You see two young girls kidding each other about the videotape that supposedly kills people, and they find out it's true and then they get killed. Then, Naomi Watts' presence in the film makes you watch without getting bored or annoyed for a second. The surrealistic video is so interesting, as well as the whole story. It's not a movie in which monsters kill others, but a psychological horror story that'll make you think a great deal about the complexity of Samara's personality.  It also has the most unpredictable and brilliant scenes in film history. For instance the scene where the horse is chasing Naomi's character is great. You'd never expect that. You say in your mind, 'Wait! It's not her time to die yet'. This scene is so full of horror, mystery, seriousness, etc. Another excellent scene is when she tries to find out about Samara's life and then a man kills himself in the bathroom. However, the best and scariest of all is when Rachel falls into the well and also when Samara gets out of the TV. What scenes! Besides its wonderful and dark photography, and strong acting by the majority of the cast, this shows the dark side of a little girl who could be so tender, but has reasons to kill even the nicest person. It'll make you think of how far a person can go because of being ignored by their family or other people. The final scenes are very unexpected, and understandable. If you really pay attention to this movie you'll understand the whole thing. Without a doubt 'The Ring' is one of the most interesting and clever psychological horror movies ever made! I could say it's the best movie of 2002, since most of 2002 movies are very bad. An example would be the corny 'The Hours' and the overrated 'Lord of the Rings'. Naomi Watts has become one of my favorite actresses. She's reached perfection and respect with 'Mulholland Drive' and 'The Ring'. She's given the roles of a lifetime, and she'll be getting fantastic offers, which she obviously deserves.  8.5/10",9,0,1,9 June 2003
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Unforgettable!
","E.T the Extra-Terrestrial tells a story about a boy named Elliot (played by Henry Thomas) who finds an extra-terrestrial outdoors. The extra-terrestrial and him become close knit friends even thought E.T is not human.
Well I just got back from the movie theater, and after seeing this I can honestly say that it's unforgettable, since it reminded me of my childhood. The musical score was superb and touching as well as the whole story. I really liked the whole movie; it's such an incredible journey that you'll never forget. As for Henry Thomas I consider he was outstanding in portraying the main character in Steven Spielberg's masterpiece. As for Drew Barrymore who I didn't recognize at all made her performance believable. The new enhanced visual effects and the digitally remastered soundtrack were altogether amazing. E.T. is a story that you'll never forget. This is a must-see since it's never before seen footage. Steven Spielberg has made an incredible movie, which is not all about fantasy; it also shows the value of friendship and love. It's worth watching and gets a strong 8 out of a 10.",Null,0,0,28 April 2002
Se7en," utterly dramatic!
","I saw this movie about 4 years ago and I can still remember it quite well. I must stress that this is not a horror movie; it's completely dramatic. Brad Pitt was great in portraying the leading character in this film; he and Morgan Freeman made it worthwhile. Morgan Freeman has showed everybody his outstanding acting skills; he seems not to be such an arrogant and bad person. He really enveloped himself into the role very well.The plot is original and unexpected; I have to warn you ahead of time that there are some possible spoilers; it's not neither a happy nor a horror movie. Some parts of this interesting movie are quite disturbing. I shall probably never forget when the fat man died at the beginning; it was horrible to see that person dying because of gluttony. It was incredible and disturbing. It certainly made me think a lot.  On the other hand it was completely impressive when the person who died of laziness seemed to be alive; he looked terrible. As for the murderer Juan Pérez (Kevin Spacey), he was great in portraying the killer. It's a movie that will make you think a lot about life and death. The outcome was incredible, I never thought Juan Perez had cut Brad Pitt's wife head off, and then Brad had killed him. It shows us that he killed him because of the wrath he felt. Overall, this is a dramatic and disturbing movie. I recommend it to everybody who likes very dramatic movies. 8/10",Null,0,0,28 March 2002
Memento," UNBELIEVABLY DISAPPOINTING AND OVER-RATED!
","Firstly, I must stress my surprise after reading the many positive reviews for Memento. These reviews, however, didn't convince me to write that this is one of the best movies I've seen.This movie is uneventful, over-hyped and, in general, it doesn't have a whole lot going for it. It's simply about a man who is unable to retain new memories after the rape and murder of his wife. He is now completely consumed with revenge, believing that killing his wife's murderer will bring justice. Thus, this movie becomes uninteresting and predictable. I just wanted this movie to end as soon as possible. The plot was dull and I was never seriously interested in who the murderer was. In the end I finally realized that the whole movie was pointless, `spoilers' since he'd already achieved his goal. Was I supposed to be impressed by this weak ending? Am I supposed to say it's the best movie ever made with an unexpected ending? The actors in this movie don't really show their depth, they should have been more dramatic without overacting.
This has been one of the most disappointing movies I've seen. I disliked it enormously. I disliked even more the fact that most reviewers loved it. This movie leaves too much to be desired. It seems that this movie was only made to fool people; I'm glad the Academy didn't make the mistake to nominate this for best picture.  3/10",Null,1,2,5 July 2002
Captain Corelli's Mandolin," Captain Corelli's Mandolin is very meaningful. But that's it!
","I saw this movie yesterday and thought it was fairly good since it had a pretty fitting title, but I was somewhat disappointed with the acting and the ending. 'Capitan Corelli's Mandolin' is a perfect title for this movie, since it tells about the way Capitan Corelli played his mandolin quite well. The mandolin signifies so many things in this movie. For instance, he could have felt happy by playing it for his love Pelagia (Penélope Cruz) or he just wanted to help relieve the tension. During a war it's obviously quite difficult to be happy or peaceful; this mandolin signifies many things in this movie: love, cleverness, happiness, etc. I think this is why I liked it. This mandolin is very important for Capitan Corelli, since it's his only refuge to show his love, hope, triumph and peace. This movie is very valuable to me and requires a thoughtful watcher. It's the only Nicolas Cage movie I have liked so far.The plot is well told. John Madden (Shakespeare's in love director) has made another worthy film in which he keeps the viewer interested in knowing what will happen to Capitan Corelli and Pelagia's love after the war; he shows us they could be very happy after the war.  Penélope Cruz was appropriate to star as Capitan Corelli's lover. She wasn't that great, but she shows us her good acting skills, even though she's from Spain. She also shows us that people from Spanish speaking countries can be good at acting. Christian Bale played Mandras rather well, it shows us he was also appropriate to play this character; he really did it much better than his earlier role in American Psycho. It's amazing to see him letting Capitan Corelli live after being so hurt by the Germans. `Capitan Corelli's Mandolin' takes us to Greece in 1940, where the Second World War is going to start. Pelagia (Penélope Cruz) and Mandras (Christian Bale) are in love; they will get married after Mandras returns from fighting for his country. Pelagia meets the Italian Capitan Corelli who is living in her house. Capitan Corelli falls in love with Pelagia and vice versa; however, they know it'll be a frustrated love, since she's engaged with Mandras who is fighting for his country and will come back to marry her. The war takes place and many Italians get killed, and Capitan Corelli gets hurt badly. Overall this is not a bad production, but I'd hoped for much more. 7/10",Null,1,2,22 January 2002
Shakespeare in Love," it won 7 academy awards
","Of course, This movie was great, very well told and acted. I'm fan of William Shakespeare, and I could learn about his life, inspirations, passion, plays, etc. This movie is excellent you will know it as you see it. The costumes and performances are great. Gwythney Paltrow won an academy award for best lead actress. She was great, She really deserved that award. See it, you will not regret it. This is funny and tells about William Shakespeare's life. See it.",9,0,0,21 July 2001
The English Patient," A great Masterpiece
","I just can't say how incredible this movie is. This is one of the favorite movies I've ever seen. This movie won 9 academy awards, which are really well-deserved. I never thought it was going to be so incredible. When I watched it. I thought it was going to be boring or just lacking of interest, but not. I wasn't right. The performances in this movie were excellent. Hanna (Juliette Binoche) an academy award winner for best supporting actress. She was great as a nurse who took care of a very ill patient, in this case 'The English Patient, Almasy' (Ralph Fiennes) who got an academy award for best actor in a leading role. I will always remind of the English patient Almasy (Ralph Fiennes) telling about his life and about his love after the first and second world war. The scenery was stunning as well. the desert in which the story took place was wonderful, the photography was flashy as well as the costumes. Katherine (Kristin Scott Thomas) an actress nominee for best leading actress in this movie, was great as well. She truly acted very well as Almasy's love and Axon´s wife. It wasn't based on a true story. However it really made me think of it as true, since the first and the second war actually happened. The most impressive part was as a person cut Caravaggio's thumbs off because he thought he was a spy person at that time. Another impressive part was as Katherine's husband died in a plane accident in which they were both in. Axon (Katherine's husband) flew up in anger because he found out about Katherine being in love with his best friend (The English patient. Lamasy). The plane crashed because of his wrath. When Lamasy saw Katherine very harmed. He left her in a cave and promised her to call doctors to heal her as soon as possible. He walked through the desert for three days without drinking anything. He finally calls the doctors with a lot of difficulty because some police thought he was german. But as he gets back to the cave where Katherine is. He realizes that she is dead. The English patient it means Lamasy reminds of it and also reminds of the accident he had with Katherine after taking her in a plane. Unfortunately the plane crashed too and Almasy burned his face and got very hurt. He remembers it with a lot of pain. He tells the nurse (juliete Binoche) about everything and finally past away. Hanna left for Florence to live with Caravaggio where she expects to be happy and meet her love again. it's really worthwhile. Don't miss it at all.",Null,0,1,23 September 2001
Elizabeth," Colombia
","This movie was great, everything was wonderful in it, it deserved all the academy awards, but Shakespeare in love won them. Shakespeare in love is a great movie as well, Gwyneth Paltrow is an excellent actress as well as Cate Blanchett. Some people can say that Cate Blanchett is better than Gwyneth Paltrow or some other people can say it's the other way around. They're both great. Cate Blanchett should have been happy and proud of herself because she was an academy award nominee for best actress, even though she didn't win it it means she is a wonderful actress. Everything in this movie was brilliant from the beginning to the ending. The story had a very good plot, if you liked it you should see 'La reine Margot', this is very similar to it, and is wonderful as well.",9,0,0,21 July 2001
The Others," What a stylish and gripping movie!!
","It has certainly been my pleasure getting to see 'The others'. It was very well developed, told and acted. I was excited seeing Grace (Nicole Kidman) every minute trying to kill the others with a shotgun. It made the movie so interesting and wonderful. Alejandro Amenábar is truly one of the best writers. He deserves an academy award for this film. I have seen 'Open your eyes' and also 'Thesis'. Thesis was pretty good, but I can't say the same for 'Open your eyes'. I really didn't like it that much since the story wasn't as brilliant as the others. The others is an excellent movie. You must see it if you like horror, mystery and thriller movies. I was reading some comments on it and saw that many people compared it with 'Sixth sense'. The others is much better than sixth sense. In fact I didn't like 'Sixth sense' at all. It was so simple and wasn't scary at all. I just laughed at it. I didn't understand why it won some academy awards. I don't think it deserved them. Anyway it's not important to keep making critical remarks about it. I hope 'The others' will win academy awards, because it really deserved them. It is amazing to see Nicole Kidman as a mother who loves her children with her whole being. She truly knows how to act. What a tremendous actress!!. I was delighted to see her a while ago in 'The portrait of a lady'. She is one of the best actresses in Hollywood. I never forget her wonderful movies. 'The portrait of a lady' by Jane Campion is my favorite movie, She did an excellent work as Isabel Archer. It's definitely her best performance. She is always beautiful and talented. She must be an academy award winner for best actress in a leading role either in Moulin Rouge or in the others. Grace's children also acted very well. it's unbelievable that two kids could do this. 'The others' is about a family (Grace and her children) who lives in a very big house after the war. Grace's husband went to the war, but he hasn't gone back to their house yet.  Her children are photo sensible, it means that they can't see the light day. They can't even go to the garden. It might kill them. It makes this movie a dark one. Some people go to work to that house (Mrs. Willis, the gardener and a girl who is mute). You'll know why she got mute at the ending. I bet it'll frighten you. Many odd things happen in this house. It seems that there are others who are living with them. The little girl tells her mother she has seen other in the house; However she doesn't believe her until she gets to see them. When you see this movie, you'll think you're living in that stylish, dark and big house. Anything can happen in this movie. Things are not always as they seem. Appearances can be deceiving. Watch and enjoy it. It's really worth watching. It's one of Nicole Kidman's best performances. 9/10",Null,0,0,11 November 2001
Insomnia," 'Insomnia' is not as disappointing as Memento, but it still is!
","Christopher Nolan, director of the mediocre and overrated 'Memento', brings us `Insomnia'. A thriller featuring three Oscar winning actors: Al Pacino (Scent of a woman), Robin William (Good Will Hunting) and Hilary Swank (Boys don't cry).'Insomnia' tells the story of detective Will Dorner (Al Pacino) who is sent along with his friend (Martin Donovan) to a small town in Alaska to solve the murder of a teenage girl. Although it's a murder that might be investigated by the local police forces, Dormer has problems with LA police department due to his excessive obsession to catch the criminals. His outstanding skills lead him to the Criminal; however, as soon as he captures the criminal a sequence of unexpected events leads him to make a great mistake. The criminal is the only one who finds out about his mistake and escapes without being caught. After these unexpected events the detective starts to be hunted by whom his prey was minutes earlier. His remorse because of his deadly mistake and the murderer's subsequent blackmails make Dormer a person who can't get to sleep at all. His insomnia is presented as a metaphor with the white and beautiful night of Alaska, where all is illuminated, blurred and confusing. The camera work and the soundtrack make the viewer get into the character's shoes, who loses his sense of reality because of his sleeping shortage.All the performances are good, but I've never liked Robin Williams because he's always making fun of people and the human body and I can't stand this at all. The actor who really stands out as usual is one of my favorite actors, Martin Donovan. If you want to see his best performance watch my favorite movie 'The Portrait of a Lady', where he delivered a perfect portrayal, as Isabel Archer's sickly and admiring cousin.
Overall, the movie was not what I expected. I can't say I liked it, but I can say that the title 'Insomnia' was original and fitting to the movie. I thought the movie would be dark and dramatic, but it wasn't. It was really simple with a terribly predictable ending. Other than the title there is nothing that should interest you in seeing this. 4/10",Null,0,0,12 October 2002
L.A. Confidential," Really disappointing
","I saw some comments on 'L.A. confidential' and found out that many people liked it. I don't know why. It lacked of an interesting plot. It was so bad. Even Though the plot wasn't great. It was nice to see Kim Bassinger's performance. She was excellent as Lynn Bracken. She truly acted so well. She got an academy award for best actress in a supporting role. I bet it is her best performance. She absolutely deserved it. I also like her performance in 'I dreamed of Africa', but it was a shame that she got a razzie award nomination for worst actress in a leading role. Anyway I think she is wonderful. As for the plot of 'L.A. Confidential' I don't think it was great enough for me since it's very confusing. You don't know who the evil characters are. But I just can say that I found it as informative because it tells about Los Angeles' crimes. Kevin Spacey and Russel Crowe were OK. They did a good work. The ending wasn't good enough either. In fact it was just unexpected. I never thought Lynn Backer was going to fall in love with the officer Wendell White (Russel Crowe). 5/10",Null,1,3,13 October 2001

It's to waste your time. It's very rude, its crude humor is disgusting. When I just got inside the movie theater and the movie started, I just wanted to get out as soon as possible, which I didn't since I didn't want to waste my money by getting out of the movie theater without knowing the ending. It was so embarrassing for some people. However most of the people who were at the movies laughed at it. I just couldn't understand why they did it. I wouldn't let my children and my friends see this. It's not worth watching at all. What a shame! Even though I haven't liked this that much I'd like to see the first one.

Forrest Gump," Over-rated and disappointing!
","'Spoilers' I must start by writing that I do not like this movie at all. Even though it began well I thought it became dull quite quickly because of the many uninteresting and pointless turns in the plot.We see Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) sitting on a bench talking to a person who sits next to him about his life. When Forrest was young he had a lot of problems because he was a handicapped person. He meets a pretty girl on the school bus and begins to fall in love with her. When some envious and mean school children are chasing him he discovers he can run, finally overcoming his physical disability. This scene was amazing because it shows that people can overcome any diseases by having faith in themselves. Forrest Gump was a brave boy who tried to run, even when it was nearly impossible for him. That was an interesting beginning. However, when he grows up and graduates from college this movie turns out to be awful, as the only thing he does is keep talking about his life as a football player, as a runner and, ridiculously as a soldier, he's inexplicably the best soldier.  Forrest Gump seems to believe he's very interesting, that his achievements in life are extremely important and valuable to us, but they aren't. For instance, we see him getting medals and many other things, but I really didn't feel interested in what he received because he seems to be so arrogant, thinking he's the best person in the world. I didn't find myself quite absorbed in the film because I didn't feel amazed by all the achievements he got. Why does he tell it? He only tells people about his achievements to show off, pretending he's a great person! He is happily and arrogantly seated on a bench telling his life to whoever sits next to him. I didn't care what he said, because he only driveled.After the disappointing climax comes the original ending, which I enjoyed because it wasn't predictable. I never thought Forrest's wife would die. She was sick but I didn't like the way she died. It seems that the writers didn't have anything interesting to add, other than a simple disease to get her out of the story. I also liked it when Forrest and his wife had a child whom they also named Forrest, but I thought the final scene where the child gets onto a bus is interesting because it's somewhat unpredictable; it looked like the whole story would begin again and I do not want to see the same insipid story again because I already went through Gump's life. I certainly do not want to go through his son's life. That'd be more grief!I do not understand why it received an academy award for best picture. I haven't seen many of 1994's movies, but I'm sure there are more inspiring and interesting movies than this one. A good example would be `Shawshank Redempion' that unbelievably lost the Oscar for best picture!Overall, this movie is not outstanding. There are many unnecessary and long scenes such as his life in the army, his life as a rich person his life as a person who waits for a bus and finally his life as a runner. I'm sure this could have been a shorter movie. If it had been this way it wouldn't be so annoying. I found the movie far-fetched because I don't think people can run as much as he did, and I don't think people can be so successful without working hard for their future. When do we see Forrest willing to be a successful person? He only did what his family and girlfriend told him to do. He was never willing to be a successful person. I know it's just a movie so I don't worry about it. All the performances in this movie were somewhat believable, especially Sally Field who was an excellent loving mother. I felt sad when she died, since her character was very caring to her son, as some mothers are to their children. Sally Field's performance was convincing, but I didn't find Tom Hanks deserving of an academy award, because he gave an unbelievably simple and unchallenging performance. His performance in 'The Green Mile' was better. 5/10",Null,17,35,23 July 2002
Bridget Jones's Diary," Is it supposed to be hilarious?
","Well I saw this movie the day before yesterday and really felt disappointed because of its plot, it's dull. It seems to me that the creator of Bridget Jones's diary makes fun of viewers by showing them a simple and uninteresting love story between an approximately 32 years old woman and her boss. He tells her that her other suitor was a deceitful person since he slept with his old girlfriend, but it was too predictable that the boss was lying to her, I didn't have to think hard to realize that. I don't think this part was a twist at all. Is that kind of plot supposed to be funny? Perhaps many of the reviewers who liked it found Bridget's personality funny, but it was annoying to me. All she does is talk about her lovers and be embarrassed all the time, which I didn't find that amusing, maybe I smiled a few times, but that was it. I thought this movie would be great since I read good reviews and some critics gave it 5stars/5stars, but I felt disappointed after it ended. It has unnecessary bad language, which I also found annoying. I don't understand why Renne Zelleweger received an Oscar nomination for her performance. Nicole Kidman gave a better and more complex performance in 'The Others', that's for sure! I thought Renne would shine on screen, but she gave a performance as bad as the one she gave in 'Jerry Maguire', She shouldn't have been so shameless, since she was making jokes throughout the whole movie, we didn't see her doing something worthy, besides we barely saw her writing something in her diary, this movie should have shown her writing in her diary more often, but it only appeared at the beginning and the end. All in all this movie wasn't that hilarious, it was bothersome, but I enjoyed the beautiful England landscapes, since they're gorgeous and I also learned that the cars in England are different from others, because they have the pilot seat on the right side, which I didn't know at all. 5/10",Null,0,1,30 June 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Best movie ever made?
","*Spoilers*Well I must stress I set my expectations high for this movie, since I thought it was going to be great, but it really wasn't. It was too fantastic, unbelievable, uninteresting, etc. I have read some comments on this movie and found out that many people love it. Why? It's not that great. It was thoroughly disappointing; however it's even more disappointing that many people love it, I just can't believe it. What did you learn about this movie? Did you learn that a ring could change the course of life? Is that the only thing you learned? Does it leave you a message for your life? Think about it. Other than Cate Blanchet's and Viggo Mortesen's performances, the acting wasn't that marvelous. I prefer read the book to see it; nevertheless the especial effects and the cinematography were outstanding, those are the only things I liked about this movie. The ending was quite incomplete. I do not look forward to seeing the ending of it in 2003. To tell you the truth I do not really like waiting that long. 6/10",6,0,0,28 January 2002
Cast Away," A touching movie
","I think this movie was a good one,  because it has some touching scenes in which Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks) had to try to get out of the island, he suffered a lot, and also got hurt because of rocks, waves, etc. His teeth also hurt, I was impressed as he hit one of his teeth with a stone. I thought I had my teeth like that for a minute, It hurts me a lot, sometimes I think about somebody who suffers because of the teeth, it's horrible to have a pain like that, so it makes this movie very different and really touching. The plot is excellent, it has a lot of interesting things like a true love, but at the same time it turns like an impossible love. When Chuck Noland finally got to get out of the island, he found out that the love of his life got married to somebody else, and also had a little baby. This movie is very realistic, Tom Hanks really seems older when he got back home, but it's because the film was halted for a year, so it makes it a very realistic movie. I enjoyed this movie a lot. The scene when he thought that he had a volleyball for a friend was touching as well as funny and sad, I think when anybody is alone, they can think anything for having friends, even if the friend was a volleyball. This movie is very good, you should see it, and think a little about it.",8,0,0,18 July 2001
American Psycho," 'American Psycho' is not worthwhile!
","I was very disappointed after seeing this movie. I never thought it was going to be so bad. I thought the only good thing about this was to see Reese Witherspoon's performance. However, I barely saw her in this movie. I was very disappointed that she did not appear much. As for Christian Bale, I never thought he was capable of doing these kinds of movies. I saw him in 'The Portrait of a Lady' and 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' where his characters were quite different from this one. He was outstanding in those movies, but I can't say the same for this one.  Why did he star in this awful movie? I can't deny he was dashing and acted well, but the plot of this movie was horribly made. It wasn't understandable that it had a lot of gore and nudity, which were completely unnecessary. I don't mind about gore and nudity, I was just p****d off because of the plot. The ending was foolish, it didn't even leave a message for my life at all or maybe it's that I should not rent movies like this, even though Reese Witherspoon and Christian Bale are in it.  What a waste of time! The ending was very confused and thoroughly disappointing. It's not worth watching such a bad movie! I'd definitely not like to read the book after seeing this.

American Psycho," 'American psycho' is not worthwhile!
","I was very disappointed after seeing this movie. I never thought it was going to be so bad. I thought the only good thing about this was to see Reese Witherspoon's performance. However, I barely saw her in this movie. I was very disappointed that she did not appear much. As for Christian Bale, I never thought he was capable of doing these kinds of movies. I saw him in 'The Portrait of a Lady' and 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' where his characters were quite different from this one. He was outstanding in those movies, but I can't say the same for this one.  Why did he star in this awful movie? I can't deny he was dashing and acted well, but the plot of this movie was horribly made. It wasn't understandable that it had a lot of gore and nudity, which were completely unnecessary. I don't mind about gore and nudity, I was just pissed off because of the plot.

American Beauty," Why is this movie so over-rated?
","I have read some comments on this movie and I realize that many people love it. I don't even understand why they like it so much. It lacks a good plot. I mean it's just not interesting. I also think it's not worth watching. It shouldn't have won 5 academy awards. It was unfair because there were wonderful movies in 1999 like 'Snow falling on cedars' and 'Angela's ashes' that should have been over-rated. I was very disappointed after knowing it won an academy award for best picture. Why? It's just about an American family who gets in a lot of sex and drugs trouble. I think it's very disappointing; it's not even funny. It didn't make me laugh at all. I couldn't just believe it won 5 academy awards. What message does this movie leave you for your life? I think none, because it doesn't teach us anything; however I like a scene in this movie; it is as Lester's neighbor tries to kiss him on the lips because he thinks he's homosexual. I thought the neighbor was homophobic at the beginning, but he wasn't. It showed us that things are often different from what they might be. It also showed us the true side of human nature, which is certainly the only thing worth watching in this.  This scene made me think a lot. It's undeniable that Kevin Spacey acted well. I think he is a great actor; nevertheless he couldn't save this a little. Let's analyze it, every character in this movie is quite different because they have so many personally and individual important meanings, thoughts, hopes, feelings, etc. This is very valuable to me. It requires much discussion. Overall this is a failed movie that was thoroughly over-rated. 4 out of a 10",4,1,2,4 January 2002
Being John Malkovich," Altogether disappointing and unrealistic!
","I set my expectations high for this movie. I thought it was going to be excellent, since I've liked all John Malcovich's movies other than this one. He was completely outstanding in 'The portrait of a lady' and 'Dangerous liaisons', but this is certainly disappointing. I never thought I'd regret to have rented this. Anyway I think it was completely unrealistic; however it's truly original. Despite everything I really enjoyed the movie a little. The plot was originally made, because I think many people wish they could have been someone else. It makes me think a lot as to who I'd like to be. We are all supposed to be like we are. This movie taught me I mustn't wish to be another person, since God created everybody as equal, we all must thank God for all the things He's ever given us. This is a good life lesson. But I don't think the movie's purpose was to teach about it, since it just minded about sex, greediness, and stuff like that. John Malcovich plays himself very well as well as John Cusak and Cameron Díaz, which I didn't recognize at all, I just found out about it. Her hairstyles and dresses were not flashy at all. Her character was quite bothersome and sick; however Catherine Keen played the part better, since she was very well cast to star as Maxine, but I couldn't believe she got an academy award nomination for best actress in a supporting role. I don't think she was that great to get it.All in all, this is an original movie. I really never thought a movie could have this sort of plot, which makes it rather interesting. It's the only thing worth watching; nevertheless the ending was a shame. I just couldn't believe two women fell in love and took care of their child. 5/10",Null,0,1,16 January 2002
Pearl Harbor," An interesting movie
","This movie was dramatic, touching, romantic, and interesting. I could see great performances like Kate Beckinsale's and Ben affleck's, this movie deserves a lot of awards, including best picture. It'll be the winner of the academy awards. The second world war is a very interesting plot for a movie, if you saw it, you would realize about how many people suffered during that time, The war time is horrible. Let's hope we won't have the 3rd one. This is touching, it's sad to see the lost of Dany's best friend in the movie, when he and her date thought that he died in the war. But when he got back to Hawaii again he saw his best friend dated with his old girlfriend who was a nurse. After all, they learned how to have courage and friendship during that time, they were friends forever until one of them truly died in this war. You should see it.

The Pianist," Not What I Expected!
","Once I found out there was a movie called 'The Pianist' and that it won la palme d'or in the Cannes Festival, I wanted to see it as soon as possible, especially just after learning Woijeck Kilar was providing the musical score in this movie. That's one of the main reasons I thought it'd be my favorite movie. Unfortunately it is not.  I must begin by saying that the movie has some quality and is really interesting because it's based on the true events of a War survivor, which is worth watching; however, I found the movie very simple. 'Simple' is the word I must use throughout this review, because the movie tells a very dramatic story, but the acting is shallow and Adrien Brody really doesn't show dramatic expressions or sadness. He's too simple and quiet while losing everything and being a survivor of War; he acts as if nothing happened. He's too quiet, and uninteresting. When playing the piano his facial expressions seem to be dissembled, instead he seems not to really feel the music he's playing as any great pianist would.Adrien Brody's last scene where he's found by the police who want to catch the Germans and says 'I'm cold' is overdone, It's not moving as it pretends to be; on the contrary it's pretentious and really unbelievable. Adrien Brody annoyed me with his quietness, he should have shown suffering and dramatic expressions without him overacting, but he didn't. He was too calmed, it seemed he didn't realize he was In a War. I knew he'd win an Oscar, even though his performance wasn't so good, however I'm happy that he did, because he's young and needs to take on more important roles to really show better acting skills. Another disappointment of this film, is Kilar's music. As I mentioned earlier, I thought his music would be as beautiful as the musical score he provided in 1996's 'Portrait of a lady'. however, his music in 'Portrait of a Lady' puts the music of 'the Pianist' to shame. The music in 'Portrait' is way more beautiful, interesting and dramatic; however, in 'The Pianist' it's dull, simple, and with no depth. The music played by Adrien Brody is not really one of the pieces I like, it's too quiet, simple  and romantic, which I dislike; however the music in 'Portrait of a Lady' is a triumph, because it's so dramatic, and so beautiful that you can't really stop listening to it, especially the shubert's part played by one of the supporting characters in the movie. Of course 'The Pianist' is not a total loss at all. It really shows very sad scenes, one I can remember is when the Nazis threw a person in a wheeled chair out of the window. Another great scene is when the people had nothing to eat and were really starving. I also liked the scene where the little boy tried to cross the wall and was trapped in it and Adrien Brody tried to help him. To me the greatest scene was when the German was touched by Adrian's playing, and helped him survive. That was really great and shows the complexity, sadness and realism of War.The pianist has very disappointing parts. It's not really what I expected; however it's still one of the best movies of 2002 and deserves all the praise it received. 7/10",Null,0,1,12 October 2003
Moulin Rouge!," What a movie!!
","When I went to the movies to watch this. I was impressed because of Satine (Nicole Kidman). She is so beautiful. Nicole Kidman is always great. Her performances are amazing, except for (Practical magic). I'll never forget her performance in my favorite movie 'The portrait of a lady' by Jane Campion. She was excellent. It was definitely her best performance. She should have won an academy award for best actress in the portrait of a lady. Anyway it doesn't matter now. I hope she will win an academy award for best actress in a leading role this year since she hasn't ever been nominated for one. Hopefully she will be the Oscar winner this time for 'Moulin Rouge'. The story is stunning as well as the performances and the music played. it was kind of modern. The scenery is very flashy as well. The windmill was an excellent instrument for making this film. This makes it different and interesting. Ewan Macgregor was OK. But I really didn't like that much his performance as a poet. In fact I really didn't like one part of this movie. It's that the movie shows the ending at the beginning. I was so disappointed. The ending was obvious in it because Christian (Ewan Macgregor) begins telling the story of Satine a smoldering temptress who is in love with him, but she finally dies because of a disease. It didn't make sense. Christian told us the story, but he first told us about Satine death. I mean it'd have been much better if he wouldn't have told us anything at the beginning. The movie lost interest after finding out that she was going to die. It was the worst thing about this movie. Anyway even though it failed on it. I think it was the best story about love ever told. The dancers and the music were amazing as well as the climate, we could see all the seasons like winter, summer, etc. I'll never forget when Satine told him that she didn't love him because she loved the duke instead.At last this is a great movie, but it shouldn't have told us the ending at the beginning. It's worth watching just for music and drama-romance lovers. 9/10",Null,0,1,7 October 2001

Mulholland Drive," Without a doubt! The best movie of 2001
","'Mulholland Drive' is one of those movies that'll really make you think about everything you see in life. It's an inspiring film that deserves all the praise it has received. The film is so mysterious, interesting and disgustingly beautiful. I say, 'disgusting' just for the love scenes and some gore, and adult stuff, but it just shows two human beings loving each other.After reading so many comments on this movie, it's hard to believe that many people hated and insulted the movie, but of course 'Mulholland Drive' isn't everyone's cup of tea. Its abusive themes, sex scenes, confusing story, and unhappy ending are some of the reasons why the movie is disliked by others.
'Mulholland Drive' does have a point. It really has a story to tell, and it's not an overly simple or an incoherent story as many people state. It's really a powerful and inspiring tale, that of a woman who wants to be a recognized actress in Hollywood with a lot of fans and money. 'Mulholland Drive' shows her dream, her impossible dream in Hollywood. We all dream of having something we don't have right now. What's the problem with this movie, then? Dreams are beautiful, surrealistic, and unavoidable. That's what happens to Diane Sewlyn (perfectly played by Naomi Watts) She dreams of being the actress she cannot be. Her life is a misery because of losing the part to her lover Camila/Rita (Laura Helena Herrigan) and then she hires someone to kill her, and what we see after that is Diane's dream She dreams of not letting Rita die and living with her and falling in love with her again. She dreams of having another opportunity in life. That's my interpretation of the whole movie; however, some other people could say that it all happens in Rita's imagination after the accident. That is a possibility as well; however, my interpretation makes much more sense, and provides an explanation of what the whole story is about.
The opening sequences are excellent, so full of horror, action and mystery. The first scene where you see Diane as an actress is amazing. The second scene where you see a car being hit by another car driven by a lot of drunken young people is a perfect beginning as well. Those scenes are so intense that you really want to know what's going to happen to Rita. But the best scene of all is the scene where the bum appears; He is appalling; you wonder what he is doing in that movie. What scenes! I love the scene when the bum first appears, because you learn that even in Hollywood there are penniless and frightening people, and also that Hollywood is not what it pretends to be -- 'A great, rich city of dreams'.Naomi Watts gives a pitch-perfect, emotionally devastating performance. It's the role of a lifetime. Her facial expressions are totally convincing and strong. The part where she's in Silencio's club is perfect. Her expressions are dramatic without her overacting. Her eyes turn red and she is quite equal to the complexity of her role. Another of her amazing scenes is where she's feeling jealous because Camilla/Rita is kissing a man. She doesn't ruin any scene; She is totally believable in the whole movie. She should have won an Oscar for best actress in a leading role. She puts Halle Berry, Sissy Spacek, Nicole Kidman, and the other best actress nominees to shame. They don't really match the complexity of Naomi's character. Naomi is just perfect for the role. At the beginning you can accept her as a beautiful, dreamy, happy, tender and nice woman called Betty who just arrives at Hollywood, and at the end you really accept her as the bitter, jealous, frustrated and hateful Diane Sewlyn. Naomi's performance is without doubt the best of the year!Laura Helena Herrigan is also a revelation.  She's not as good as Naomi, but she also gives a very strong and convincing performance as Naomi's lover. Her scenes in Silencio's club are excellent and also when she opens the blue box her performance is believable and dramatic. Those scenes are so intense, dense and unexpected.The direction is stunning as well as the editing and the musical score. 'Mulholland Drive' succeeds in showing how fake Hollywood is. It also shows poverty, jealousy, violence and the unhappiness of some people in the so-called `City of Dreams'.The ending is perfect. The final scene is brilliant because you see Diane's dream getting crushed and also the final cut where a person says `silencio' in an evil way is totally interesting and believable. It shows the dream is over and that everybody and everything must be in silence!David Lynch has created a masterpiece; I haven't seen any other of his movies, but if they're similar to Mulholland Drive, he must be one of the best directors in film history. The women he chooses are so good looking that it's hard not to pay attention to their story. Mulholland Drive is a triumph, and without a doubt the best movie of 2001. 9/10",Null,1,2,19 June 2003
The Piano," A movie interesting and sensual.
","This movie was great. Jane Campion does an excellent work, I always like Jane Campion's movies, I had the opportunity to see 'The piano' It was a very interesting movie in which the viewer get astounded following this wonderful story about a woman who get married to somebody who loves her, but she doesn't love him at all. She had to marry him because of her silent and necessity. She is a mute person and her only happiness is her beautiful piano and her beautiful daughter who understands her very well even if she can't speak, her daughter is the only one who can understand her through signs and gestures. She fells in love with somebody who took her piano. And she get faced with her husband and her love. She wants to be with her only love even though she will lose her piano and her talent. As her husband knew about this love, he cut her finger off so that she wouldn't play the piano any more, She lost her unique talent. It was really getting to me, I think it was very sad that she lost her finger, Can somebody play the piano without a finger? This movie makes me think a lot. Even though she didn't have a finger I think she's the best pianist in the whole world. Everybody should see this magnificent movie.",9,1,4,7 June 2001
Jerry Maguire," ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES I'VE EVER SEEN!
","Having seen this. I can honestly say it has certainly been my misfortune getting to see this stale movie. I say `stale' because the movie itself doesn't teach us anything at all. What do we learn about this movie after its ending? Do we learn that love for a `ridiculous football game' is everything in life? This movie is centered on a football game, which makes most people who like this movie fool themselves and enjoy Mr. Cruise's and Cuba Gooding's failed performances without realizing how bad and shallow they are. The plot of this movie is certainly flawed because of the uninteresting language used throughout the movie and lack of qualities to make us enjoy this. The people who don't like it, including myself lose interest after it begins; the story is so uninteresting and simple, since it's only about a football game and a love story, which make us uncomfortable every minute in the course of this movie.Cameron Crowe did his best to bring us one of the most ridiculous and over-rated movies ever made. I'm not ashamed to say that 'Jerry Maguire' is one the worst movies I have ever seen. I know what I say. I have seen lots of bad movies. No offense, but if I think carefully I'd be pretty sure it's probably worse, since it's extremely over-rated and unpleasantly acted. One of the reasons why it's that way, is that many reviewers surprisingly gave it a good score and the Academy had the nerve to give it about 5 Oscar nominations, unfortunately including both best performance by an actor in a leading role and best performance by an actor in a supporting role. Added to that, best screenplay, best picture, etc (I don't want to remember all the nominations it received, since it makes me sick) how could the Academy give an Oscar to Cuba Gooding for best supporting actor? Could they not see how shallow and overdramatic it was? He thinks he's an excellent actor and that his performance in this mess was fascinating, but it wasn't at all. It seemed to me that he overacted too much, whenever he cried, he did it in a so fictitious way, that instead of making me feel what his character was supposed to feel, he made me laugh at his `supposed' wistful feelings, which obviously he didn't make moving at all. If you want to see an amazing and moving performance, watch Martin Donovan's performance in `The Portrait of a Lady', who should have won the academy award for best supporting actor in 1996, but sadly he didn't even get a nomination. He portrays the main character's sickly cousin and he does it amazingly, look at his facial expressions, the way he coughed truly made me think he was dying. I don't understand why the Academy couldn't see his riveting performance and instead of seeing it, gave a nod to Cuba's failed performance, who felt the king of the world when he won it. Perhaps he thought that showing himself naked in `Jerry Maguire' could give him the coveted statuette, painfully he was right! Anyway I don't dislike him, I'm just saying that his performance in this movie wasn't that great to be an academy award winner. He gave a better performance in `Men of Honor'; I'd have enjoyed seeing him win an Oscar for this performance instead of wining it in this mess of movie.
What a shame! It's the worst best picture nominee ever! At least other very bad movies I've seen, haven't been nominated for best movie, which makes me a little bit glad. Anyway my concern is how it could receive about 6 nods for academy awards. There were amazing movies in 1996 like `The Portrait of a Lady' and `The Crucible', which should have been nominated for best picture, but they grievously didn't. How could this? At least they both received two Oscar nominations, which are something to be proud of, no nominations would be worse. I always ask myself: How could The Academy think that this ridiculous and sappy movie could have been better than `The Portrait of a Lady' released in the same year? How could Jane Campion's masterpiece be under-rated? How could it get academy award nominations for best screenplay and best picture? The plot of Jerry Maguire is horribly made and not recommendable at all. This is not what movies should be like! This movie should have shown a subtle or a different dialogue, which would have made it worth watching, but the dialogue in this movie is boring, bothersome, slow, pretentious, isn't it?? The whole movie was about Jerry Maguire's lovers and an uninteresting football game. Every character in this movie is so annoying because they only talk about this game. Seriously all they do is to talk about this.Let's analyze Mr. Cruise's performance, if you see it closely, you'll find out that he gives a very disappointing performance, since he doesn't care what the viewers think of him, look at his expressions, he thinks he's interesting and funny, but he isn't, instead he's annoying and his shallow performance is totally obvious. No offense, but he needs to be taught by his beautiful ex wife Nicole Kidman who gave a pitch perfect emotionally devastating performance in `The portrait of a lady' as well as her magnificent co-star Barbara Hershey. He doesn't really make his performance plausible because every word he says in this movie seems to be a lie, it seems like he memorized the whole script without thinking about the deepness of his character. For instance we see that he tries to help Gooding's character, but he helps him without feeling the character himself. He only talks to everybody without interest and the deepness that his character probably requires. I don't have anything against Mr. Cruise; however I don't think it's one of his best performances to date. I'm sure he was better in `Magnolia', which also earned him an Oscar nomination and a golden globe. I was just shocked to see him getting an Oscar nomination for best actor in a leading role for this movie. I have seen some of Tom Cruise's movies and I think some of them are fairly good; nevertheless, they weren't as horrible as this one. I think Tom Cruise is a good actor, but as a leading actor in this movie, Mr. Cruise leaves too much to be desired!I don't really like comedy romantic movies like this one. It only shows how a man quits his job and falls in love. This plot makes me consider it so romantic, pointless, sappy and extremely ridiculous; All the scenes in `Jerry Maguire' aren't worth watching, they only show love for an insipid football game and love for uninteresting people like Renne Zellweger who hopefully gave a better performance in `Bridget Jones's Diary'. She thinks she's so tender and sweet in this movie, probably she is in real life, but to me her character in this movie only makes me somewhat upset, because it is annoying since she's only led by Jerry Maguire to carry out a gushy love story. It's very sad that it got so many accolades. The accolades that many interesting and under-rated movies should have got in 1996.It's worth watching if you like mediocre, romantic and comedy movies. I bet you'll not regret it. Otherwise don't watch it, because it's highly unlike you'll enjoy it.Overall, TWO THUMBS DOWN!! This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It has truly been simple, uninteresting and gushy. I respect Cameron Crowe as a director, I know he's a distinguished filmmaker, but I have to say that `Almost Famous' and `Jerry Maguire' are indeed over-rated and so pointless that don't make me excited about seeing his further movies.It's a sorrow that many people loved it. You should try seeing powerful and interesting stories that do teach us something for our lives, not like `Jerry Maguire' that fooled lots of people and especially the Academy with its fake charming, didn't it? I hope nobody is offended by the possible objectionable content of my review. I just needed to say what I felt about this horrible movie; by the way I'm rather glad I'm not the only one who thinks this is a horrible romantic movie, some of my friends disliked it as much as I did, and I could see why. 2/10",Null,2,8,14 June 2002
"Girl, Interrupted"," Fairly interesting!
","'Girl, Interrupted' is a fairly interesting movie, since it tells the story about some girls who are at claymore. Claymore is a private mental hospital. All of those girls have different kinds of personalities. Susan is quiet; Polly is very frustrated because she has been scarred by an accident caused by fire. Daisy is quiet and strange. Lisa (The Academy Award Winner Angelina Jolie) is a rebellious girl who thinks she's right on everything she does.Angelina Jolie played her character quite well; she really envelops herself into the role; however Cloe Sevigni should have won the academy award for best actress in a supporting role instead. She truly deserved it. Anyway Angelina was amazing in portraying this complicated girl. Angelina Jolie and Winona Ryder carry out their roles splendidly. But I keep wondering why Winona Ryder didn't get any awards for her performance.Suicide is an interesting topic for a movie, since it happens quite frequently everywhere. I also like the way all the girls show their true friendship. This is not a bad movie, but the direction and the cinematography could have been much better. 7/10",Null,1,1,26 January 2002

1 It's quite slow and unnecessary murders happen. 2 The acting isn't convincing. 3 The story isn't neither gripping nor interesting. 4 It wasn't really scary to me, it was just disturbing.
The ending is very disappointing as well as its beginning. I didn't learn anything from this movie, but the only thing I liked was to see the wonderful costumes at that time. That's why I rate it a 3/10; otherwise I'd rate it a 1/10.",Null,1,2,23 March 2002

In fact I think the movie was very difficult to follow so it made me pay attention to it every minute. Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise were excellent as a couple, they could act very well and understandable. Nicole Kidman shows that she is a great actress, she can perform any roles she wants to. She is excellent. Tom Cruise is a great actor as well, he demonstrated that he could act in a thriller-drama movie. It was very well directed by Stanley Kubrick who died four days after filming it. He showed most of his old films in this movie. It has a lot of meanings, maybe he can knew that it was going to be his last movie, so I think this is his best masterpiece. This it not boring, it has an interesting plot in which I got astounded every minute, from the beginning to the end.",8,0,1,22 July 2001
Mystic River," Unbelievably disappointing, over praised and ridiculous!
","'Mystic River' has received rave reviews around the world. It's been called one of the best pictures of the year and it's likely to get the Oscar. Why? I'd say it's because 'Mystic River' with its fake power fooled people and critics as usually bad movies do. The perfect example is `A Beautiful Mind', `Forrest Gump', 'Titanic', etc. `Mystic River' is fake and disappointing. Aside from the predictability and triviality, I found the acting unconvincing.I can honestly say that 'Mystic River' is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. It pretends to be so moving, dramatic and powerful, but it fails in all counts.`Mystic River' tells the story of three men who had a difficult childhood. One of them was `supposedly' raped, and the others had different problems. As time went on, one of them had problems with his missing wife and the other with penal antecedents.Let's begin by the countless mistakes: 1. At the beginning of the movie we see these three men in their childhood. 25 years go by, but the characters look terribly old, especially Sean Penn's. It's ridiculous they'd get so old, while Kevin Bacon's character looks rather young. In fact much younger than his friends.2. The movie is overdone. There wasn't a scene that I found powerful or completely believable. Sean Penn is annoying. His performance is over the top, without his showing any real feelings. He tries so hard and makes it what it is `A mess'.3. Tim Robbins also overacts. He is too ridiculous and his lack of seriousness as an actor is evident. He was `supposedly' abused as a child, but eventually he marries and has a child. He keeps his frustration inside himself, but then he shows his anger by killing a man who was abusing another child. That's too much easy and farfetched. Oddly enough it happens the same day, in which Penn's character's daughter is brutally killed.4. The wives are completely disagreeable. They just keep sobbing and hugging each other making this an annoying flick. I'd have felt for them, but the story is so contrived and pointless that it's hard to do so.5. The score is dull and lacks liveliness or even a dramatic touch to make it at least more powerful, but it's the same foolish music over and over again.6. Kevin Bacon's character is a waste of time. I don't see the point of his being in the movie at all. The whole movie would've been the same without his presence. It's contrived that he's a murder investigator and that he has a missing wife with a child and at the ending they just appear again like a fairy tale.7. The ending is terribly weak, predictable, bad and laughable. It left me with the feeling as if it were good to take the law into your hands and kill the suspects of the murder of your daughter, and then feel proud of doing so. Then at a parade Kevin Bacon's character with his wife and child happily smiles at Mr. Penn's character. It's just corny and completely annoying. In a way it reminds me of the triviality of `The Hours', but in a masculine version. They are both disappointing and gushy and they're both over praised.`Mystic River' without a doubt is a huge disappointing. The fact that it was shot in 39 days says so. It was a haste effort with no depth and accuracy looking contrived and unbelievably trite. 3/10",1,30,48,11 December 2003
A Beautiful Mind," Not as bad as I thought it'd be!
","Well I must stress that most of the time I disagree with the Academy's picks for best picture. The Academy has always chosen the wrong movies such as Titanic, The gladiator, American Beauty and finally A beautiful Mind. I thought 'A Beautiful Mind' would be a bad movie, since it was chosen by the Academy, but it certainly wasn't that bad. The academy doesn't see what's really worthy. `The others' was an outstanding movie; it should have received what it did. There are so many wonderful movies that weren't even nominated for best picture. But anyway it doesn't matter. 'A Beautiful Mind' isn't that good; nevertheless I really liked it a little. I'm so glad the academy chose it instead of 'Lord of the Rings'. I don't deny it was much better than the over-rated movie I already mentioned. The acting was believable, but I didn't see anything great about Jennifer Connelly's performance. I don't like Russell Crowe at all, He seems to be such an arrogant and pretentious person, but I must say that he acted very well in this movie. I like this movie because it teaches us to love all the things we have and to ignore all the people who make us feel bad. It's a well-told and acted story. The make up of this movie was amazing. The way John Nash got older was utterly believable. Overall I'm glad it wasn't as bad as I thought it'd be, this is a movie in which we all can learn many things about life, we all have to live everyday to its fullest. 7/10",Null,0,2,18 April 2002
Ice Age," A movie for kids and grown ups!
","Well I must stress that I didn't really laugh much over the course of Ice Age, maybe it's because I'm too serious, but I didn't really find anything funny in this movie, perhaps I just smiled a few times. Well this is a great and different animated movie. It was also original, since it shows the beautiful landscapes of a cold winter. I love snow, so I think that's why I liked it. The cinematography is gorgeous and the story is somewhat interesting. It's a nice movie for kids and also for grown ups. I saw many adults and kids in the theater and they all seemed to have enjoyed the whole film. I don't really think I wasted my money seeing this. On the contrary, it was well done and quite entertaining. It leaves a good message for all people: help your friends whenever they need it. This movie shows how other children's movies should be. There are so many rude and inappropriate movies for children and kids really need a good influence for their lives, but I'm certainly glad it's not like that. Overall it's an entertaining movie that everybody will enjoy. 7/10",Null,0,0,4 May 2002
The Green Mile," convincing performances!
","Well I recently saw this movie and thought it was rather interesting, since it tells a story about an innocent prisoner who is accused of killing two little girls. The way Michael Clarke Duncan  played his role was amazing; he really made 'The Green Mile' worth watching. I also liked when he healed Tom Hanks' character from his illness. It was great and made me think a lot. I also liked all the miracles he performed, it was interesting as he healed the woman who was quite sick. It was moving. The man who played Perci really did a good job, he made his character completely convincing. As for Tom Hanks, What can I say? He was just great in portraying the main characterThe only part I didn't like was the ending. I think it was quite disappointing and unbelievable! How can a man live so many years just for having been touched by a prisoner?. It just doesn't make sense. It shouldn't have ended this way. Spoilers: I think it was unfair that the prisoner got executed at the end. It wasn't really moving for me. 7/10",Null,0,1,2 March 2002
The Shawshank Redemption," Foul Language!
","'The Shawshank Redemption' is a good movie, but there are definitely a number of disconcerting aspects to it, such as foul language and violence. It takes a lot in a film to actually offend me. I'm a reviewer, so I have to tell what I thought about the movie. Very foul language does tend to bother me a bit, because it gives all the characters of this movie a self bad image, in addition to that, the Bible says `Do not let your mouth coarse foul language because it involves sinful speech'. 'The Shawshank Redemption' could have been better, but we hear very bad words and an overdrawn narrative throughout the whole movie. Spoilers: This movie is mostly about a man who is in jail and has to face evil people including the mayor who wants to make his life miserable, but he's very smart and gets ahead in life by trying to break a wall with a hammer to escape from jail! Probably this movie moved many people simply because the main character (Tim Robbins) was intelligent and brave, however the whole movie doesn't tell much, only the main character's life in jail and his effort to get rid of it by hope and boldness, which I didn't find very annoying! The ending was somewhat farfetched and predictable, in addition to that we never knew if the man who killed the main character's wife was punished, however I thought that this movie leaves an interesting message at the end which is to have hope when everything seems impossible. 7/10",Null,0,2,27 July 2002
The Silence of the Lambs," Brilliant thriller
","This movie was excellent, this is kind of brilliant and scary, This is not a bad movie that lacks of a good plot. The plot is very brilliant and different from other horror movies like scream. This is about a person out of mind who kills people but at the same time he falls in love with Clarice ( Jodie Foster), he does everything he can to protect her, it means that the worst killer like Hannibal could have feelings. watch it and think about this interesting thriller, the conversation between Clarice and Hannibal makes it as interesting as reality, it seems so real. It truly deserved the Academy award for best picture, best actress, best actor, etc.",Null,0,0,22 July 2001
Signs," Unbelievable , Predictable, a little humor and that's all!
","I was speechless after seeing this movie; I never thought it would turn out to be so awful. I was unimpressed, really!There isn't much to talk about this movie because there isn't any story. Mr. Gibson's performance could not save the movie.  I just couldn't stop laughing at his performance; he didn't make it believable, as it seems to me he overacted. I've never liked Mel Gibson very much,. He is such an arrogant person and I don't like most of his movies. The little girl made me laugh, when she said 'there is a monster outside my room, can I have glass of water? ' And Mel Gibson looked at her in a dramatic way that was very funny, because it was so unbelievably trite. In addition to that, the little girl just wasn't necessary in this movie, this would have been the same without her. This is a story of a priest who lost his faith because his wife died in a car accident. Then he is upset with God and doesn't let him be in his life any more. His brother, (Joaquin Phoenix) lives with him and is worried about some signs that the Aliens are making in the corn fields. The scenes with the Alien were not very impressive and the children's acting was the same! Finally Mr. Gibson recovers his faith, isn't that too predictable?I respect everybody's opinion, but I can not understand why many people liked this movie. There wasn't really a plot, it wasn't scary, but very funny. The kid's performances were as shallow as Mr. Gibson's. Overall, this movie was a disappointment. Nevertheless the lighting and cinematography were very good! Also liked the nice message that this movie sent, as it shows that God forgives and helps us even when we are going through tough moments. But that was all I liked about this. I give it 3/10",Null,2,3,2 November 2002
Amélie," Pointless Movie Masquerading as an Excellent One!
","Although it has a remarkable musical score, good reviews, good performances, a good-looking leading actress and a great speech by the narrator, the whole movie was a disappointment. It seemed an excellent movie, since most reviewers recommended it a lot saying that it deserves the highest possible accolade; nevertheless I consider them quite wrong, I never thought this movie would become so bad and pointless. I must stress that some of the piano music was interesting, but it didn't fit together with the whole plot. The music should have been more appropriate for this movie.After the movie ends, what do you feel? Did you feel satisfied? If you want to know my answer, well, it's that I didn't feel anything and I didn't feel satisfied at all. Perhaps the narrator made me follow the story without disliking it so much; however, his great speech couldn't make it any better. 'Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain' is one of the worst and most over-rated French movies I've ever seen. I can't believe most people liked it, nor did I think this movie should've been awarded an Oscar for best foreign picture. What are people thinking? It shouldn't have even received nods for academy awards. I'm glad it didn't win any. This is one of the few times I barely agree with the academy picks. I'm sure 'No man's land' is better than this.When I read the news articles of this movie I discovered that the director of this immature and pointless movie said before the Academy awards ceremony that if he won an Oscar for this movie, he'd sleep with the statuette for a month. I'm not pretty sure if he said 'for a month', I don't remember. In fact it doesn't matter how long he'd sleep with it, it matters that he said that. What does he think of life? Does he think that an academy award is a holy thing? He's as ridiculous and immature as his whole movie is'. Anyway I hope nobody is offended by this comment, I just said what I thought. I don't think the director should have said such things. An Oscar is something to be proud of, but it's not something to worship and sleep with. I assume it's the reason why he didn't get it. 3/10",Null,3,5,3 June 2002
Gangs of New York," Unrealistic and farfetched, however it has some merit!
","'Gangs of New York' is not an easy film to watch. It's excessively violent. There's a lot of blood and some disturbing scenes. I don't mind any of those things as long as they are not farfetched as they were in this movie. The violence is so farfetched that you think it's only a movie and that there is no way it could have ever happened. The whole thing goes beyond being realistic, so it becomes forced and unbelievable. The love story becomes predictable and uninteresting. We don't really seem to have any reasons to care about the love story of Amsterdam and Cameron's characters. It all becomes too farfetched. Daniel Day Lewis is not as great as many people are saying. He seems to be too prepared for his performance, so that it becomes what it is, only a 'performance'. Leonardo Dicaprio is miscast. He's much better doing other kinds of dramas or comedies like 'Catch me if you Can'. You're so used to seeing him as the nice boy that it's hard for him to fit in this part. However, he's passable as well as Cameron Díaz. Her performance is good, though she needs a better script to really show better acting skills. Her performance in the knife scenes is very powerful and strong. Her eyes turn red and when they do, it means they're really getting into the role as if they were living the drama itself. Martin Scorsese annoys me as always. He annoyed me with movies like 'The Last Temptation of Christ' and 'Age of Innocence'. He seems not to believe in God, since you see Amsterdam throwing the Bible into water (a gratuitous event) and you also see a family praying for their safety, but just as they finished praying, the War begins and people destroy their house. It's as if Martin Scorsese would've said to people 'don't believe in God, throw the Bible into the lake, or see that God doesn't do what we ask Him to do). Those things really annoyed me in this movie, and they were gratuitous events. The movie could've been the same without those scenes.
'Gangs of New York' has some good points as well. There are some gripping scenes like the knife throwing scene and the fight between the butcher and Amsterdam. Cameron's performance is outstanding, and Leonardo's return in movies is nice to see. The story is predictable, but you really want Amsterdam to win, so it doesn't bother me. Overall, 'Gangs of New York' has many flaws, but it has good points as well, so it deserves a 6/10",Null,1,2,9 June 2003
