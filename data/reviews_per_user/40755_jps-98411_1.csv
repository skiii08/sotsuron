Blade Runner 2049," Mythology Inspiration.
","Great Movie. OST is not as good as the first but still very good.The reproduction theme is extrapulated from myths of mesopotamia about The origins of human beings according to ancient Sumerian texts.Humans were created by gods, Initially human beings were unable to reproduce on their own, but were later modified with the help of Enki and Ninki. Thus, Adapa was created as a fully functional and independent human being. This 'modification' was done without the approval of Enki's brother, Enlil, and a conflict between the gods began. Enlil became the adversary of man, and the Sumerian tablet mentions that men served gods and went through much hardship and suffering.Adapa, with the help of Enki, ascended to Anu where he failed to answer a question about 'the bread and water of life'. Opinions vary on the similarities between this creation story and the biblical story of Adam and Eve in Eden.Similar to the first Blade Runner that features some conspiracy theorist elements like the masonic symbolism - Also containing Biblical (mythology) background, more precisely the man trying to reach the heavens with the Tower of Babel - This one story also features some conspiracy theorist elements of illuminati secret society. Genetics is also present in those theories.",10,0,5,6 January 2018
