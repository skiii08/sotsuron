Ford v Ferrari," All Gas, No Brakes
","You have to have a big dump in your pants if all you're gonna do is complain about 'historical inaccuracies' of a movie. Extremely entertaining film. Great cast, fun movie. Bale crushes it per usual.",8,88,131,21 November 2019
Us," Actually Bad
",All this movie wants you to do is go on the internet afterwards and read the 75 million different theories people have about it.Also to call this a 'horror movie' is comical. Dumbest movie I've seen in a while.,3,374,586,27 March 2019
Joker," No Laughing Matter
","The movie wants you to be uncomfortable. And you are uncomfortable, but that doesn't necessarily make it a good movie. Phoenix obviously does a great job as Joker but it's pretty dull. The last 25 minutes is the most entertaining, but that doesn't make up for the first hour and half.",6,3,17,7 October 2019
It Chapter Two," Popped Balloon
",The movie is mediocre at best. Had low expectations but when a horror is more funny than scary that's a bit of an issue. You feel every minute of the almost 3 hour run time. You can feel the movie wear you down. It's a marathon.,6,18,31,6 September 2019
Creed II," Rocky 3 2018
","Legit Rocky 3 but instead of Mr. T it's Drago's son. No joke thats all you need to know. Compared to 'Creed', this one disappoints.",5,23,48,23 November 2018
