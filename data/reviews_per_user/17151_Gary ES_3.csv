Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A must see visual extravaganza that sets the stage for episodes 2 &3.
","The Phantom Menace is a movie that everybody should see.  The world that Lucas creates is so visually stunning that you might find yourself staring at the screen in awe and not paying attention to the dialog.  It won't really matter anyway because the plot is not too difficult to grasp. Besides this simplicity and the fact that it is confined to setting the stage for the sequels, The Phantom Menace is pure fun that makes you feel like kid again.  You won't see a better sci-fi movie until Episode II is released; I can't wait.",8,0,0,2 July 1999
Fargo," One heck of a darn good movie eh!
","In a time where big Hollywood productions with incredibly banal characters and plots are dominating movie media, it is refreshing to watch a masterpiece such as Fargo.  Everything about this movie is amazing, but what intrigued me the most was the dialog.  I'm from a province in Canada that is located directly above North Dakota and am therefore familiar, and sometimes find myself using, the dialog style or accent that was used superbly in this film.  Not only is the dialog amazing, but the performances of Bill Macey and Frances McDormand  are two of the best I have ever seen.  To truly appreciate the accuracy of the screenplay and performances in Fargo you should visit North Dakota or Western Canada someday.  I'm sure you'll laugh if you happen to overhear the smalltalk (it's pretty darn cold eh). Besides the incredible originality and accuracy of the settings and characters, the Coen brothers create this plot that seems so out of place in this small quiet community of farmers and shop owners.  And yet what makes it so intriguing is the fact that such evil and deceit could occur in such a harmless environment.  I recommend that everybody see this movie and appreciate it for the many things (little and  big) that it does so well.",10,0,0,5 July 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," Intense
","Very intense, very disturbing, and very enjoyable.  Stanley Kubrick capitalized on an inherent weakness of humanity; fantasy.  I would venture to say that everyone has had some sort of fantasy and felt guilt afterwards. This movie explores this guilt, how people deal with it, and how it effects the ones you love.Fantastic acting by everyone involved, and incredible screenplay.  Spoken and unspoken words were real and intense, which prevented any dull moments from occurring during the 2 1/2 hours.  Kubrick should win an Oscar for best screenplay.8/10",8,0,0,29 July 1999
