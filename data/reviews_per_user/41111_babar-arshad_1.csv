Angels & Demons," epic fail
","From the spectacular ruining of the Da Vinci code, i was very apprehensive to go and watch this movie, but with hope and fairly good reviews i thought against my better judgement and went.The only thing i got out of this movie was simply seeing all the places that the story flowed through, other than that it was very average. from someone who has never read the book, but watched the movie will think it was good, but for those who have read the book, will again no doubt be disappointed.producers/writers/directors should take note from the lord of the rings, making a movie that is 3 hrs along or splitting it up, is far better than condensing it into 2hrs worth of mediocre rubbish.i don't understand why Dan brown would allow his books to remain one of the best sellers of our generation, yet let the cinematic versions rot in the bargain DVD bucket.",4,7,20,19 May 2009
