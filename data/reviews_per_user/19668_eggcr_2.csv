The Rock," Bruckheimer's best and a personal favorite
","If you only see only one Jerry Bruckheimer movie, let it be The Rock. It is proof that if the team of Bruckheimer and Bay can get their hands on a decent script, they are capable of making some great stuff. The dialog was suprisingly intelligent and nothing was corny. The humor was well timed,hilarious, and didn't mess up the course of the movie unlike Armageddon. The character development was excellent. The film successfully showed why we should care about them. Although some characters were more developed than others, it is still enough to make to make you feel for the characters who got killed, unlike movies like The Mummy which basically made 'expendable characters' who's sole purpose was to get killed sometime during the film. What i really liked was how the movie portrayed Ed Harris's character, General Hummel. Unlike most action movies, the villain wasn't portrayed as a heartless ogre, but rather a normal person with good intentions but is trying to get them the wrong way. Harris's performance almost makes you want to root for him. Sean Connery was great, as usual. Although i think Nicholas Cage is a great actor, he can't play a tough guy. I don't know why but he doesn't convince me that the character he is playing is tough and comes across goofy. Fourtunately, he didn't play one in The Rock, he played an FBI chemical who had no combat experience which was a perfect part for him. But he later got type casted into playing tough guy roles like Con Air, Face Off, and Gone in 60 Seconds. The supporting cast was great as well. Michael Biehn did a great job in the few minutes of screen time he got (His argument with Ed Harris right before the shower room shoot out was one of the most intense parts of the movie). David Morse, who played Ed Harris's assistant, had the most underrated performance. The action is intense and the special effects look very realistic.Overall, The Rock is an excellent action flick and arguably the best action film of the 90's. 5 out of 5",9,1,1,21 June 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Good, but not that good
","I have to give Lord of the Rings credit. Despite running almost three and a half hours, it kept my attention all the way through to the end. There have been a lot of movies I've seen that are significantly shorter but I end up checking my watch every so often anyway (most notably every Kevin Smith movie I've been forced to sit through.) But I wouldn't consider it to be the #2 movie of all time, I wouldn't even consider it to be Oscar worthy. I found a lot of movies ranked lower on the top 250 (Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Matrix, The Shawshank Redemption, Snatch, Seven, and Glory just to name a few) to be a lot more entertaining than Lord of the Rings. The acting was good enough, Peter Jackson did a fine job of directing, but there is nothing really special about it. Maybe I'll change my opinion after I see the two sequels. It's definitely worth seeing, but don't expect it to be a world beater.I think a 7.5 is a more accurate rating than 9.0.",7,0,0,25 February 2002
