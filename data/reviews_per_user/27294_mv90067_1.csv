Hereditary," Why was it so bad?
","I really disliked this film. I almost walked out of the theater. I feel that there were a lot of potentially scary moments that were set up, but ultimately never came to fruition. I found this movie somewhat creepy (not really) and definitely not scary. It was a huge letdown with an ambiguous and boring ending. I wanted money on this movie.",2,1,5,4 August 2018
