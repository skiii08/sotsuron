Alien 3," for this film, they should have never made alien resurrection...
","...let me explain, despite what appears to be a lowish score for this film, i love it. But anything over 7/10 is a classic film in my view is one brinking upon immortality from age of cinema/TV etc (eg: aliens, terminator, etc.)A brief overviewalien 3 is a great movie. Many people slag it off, and i'm not sure why. Had it not been for fox wanting to resurrect the series in the form of jean-Pierre Jeunet's 1997 addition, (i do not count the Avp movies as additions as they are a completely different concept) it would have been a great conclusion. It is extremely gritty, and it is easy to see why when you see that this film's cast is mainly British actors. British actors for some reason manage to do the whole 'gritty-horror' film thing very well. Also this film's setting is very dirty and dingy.The alien itself, as all alien director's have done is a unique design (with the possible exception of the new AsVP design, which goes back to the design from aliens, in my opinion the best alien film but not the best design). The first (Alien) introduced us. The second (Aliens) is less a drooling creature, and appears more rigid. The fourth (Alien Resurrection) were brown, and had fins on the end of their tails to allow fluid swimming for an underwater scene. But the third's is very, very fast. It is truly a terrifying incarnation of the xenomorph, possibly the best since the original. It is extremely menacing, and spawned one of the greatest concepts for fans of alien, the predalien. This is the first film that mentions the concept of an alien getting traits from it's host.But the most important thing about this film is the ending. It manages to pull off an emotional ending in her sacrifice, despite the whole series being about pure terror and horror. I really do love the ending. Ripley's sacrifice to 'kill' the alien (just to have her efforts ruined by Brad Dourif, J.E Freeman and others). Forget the ending to Titanic, or even End of Evangelion (for those not aware of what it is, if you knew you would understand, even if it is interpreted different to mine). Unfortunately the truly fabulous ending is ruined just by the creation of alien resurrection. It shouldn't have been ruined, even if resurrection isn't that bad in my opinion.This is a very good film, even though at times it does manage to a little hollow. However, that's not what the genre/series/film sets out to be.",7,1,7,3 August 2007
