First Man," Could have been better/
","I was born at a time when the 'Space Race' was rife. Yuri Gagarin had shocked everyone in the West when he, in 1961, when he become the first human to orbit in space on Vostok and this just showed that the Russians were ahead in the race. And then came the announcement by John F Kennedy about putting a man on the Moon. There were Mercury and Gemini Missions into the Space and it was these that led to the Apollo Missions and this is what this movie shwed - how the Apollo Missions came into existence and the life of the famous Astronaut, Neil Armstrong during his life as an Astronaut.'First Man,' based on the book by James R Hansen, is Directed by Damien Chazelle and stars Ryan Gosling as 'Neil Armstrong,' Claire Foy as 'Janet Armstrong, Jason Clarke as 'Ed White,' Kyle Chandler as 'Deke Slayton,' Corey Stoll as 'Edwin Eugene 'Buzz Aldrin'', Olivia Hamilton as 'Pat White,' Shea Whigham as 'Virgil Ivan 'Gus Grissom,'' Pablo Schreiber as 'Jim Lovell, Lucas Haas as 'Michael Collins' and Corey Michael Smith as 'Roger Chaffe.' The movie is produced by Steven Spielberg.Ryan Gosling is good in the role that he portrays and especially when it comes to showing emotions when his daughter dies and also when he hears the deaths of other Astronauts, including Ed White, Virgil Ivan 'Gus' Grissom and Roger Chaffe, who are killed on what is now known as 'Apollo 1.' Claire Foy is perfect as 'Janet Armstrong.' But the movie fails elsewhere. There's no mention of Neil Armstrong participating in the Korean war as a fighter pilot. There's no mention of NACA, which was the predecessor to NASA. It also fails to show the Astronauts training and how hard it really is / was for them. And it did not show the backup crew for Apollo 11, which consisted of James Lovell, William Anders and Fred Haise training either. Lastly, though there was a small hint about the political pressure as to why send humans into Space, very little of it is really mentioned and it failed to explain why Armstrong was sent to 'The White House.' A lot of other aspects of the Apollo 11 Mission could have been explained but were not. It could have shown how close-knit Astronaut community was at that time. But it did not capture that. Lastly, having lived through the times when the Apollo missions were taking place, it felt like that Director almost failed to capture the euphoria that took place at the time.Conclusion: It could have been a better movie. Nevertheless, still worthwhile watching it once.",6,0,0,21 October 2018
Lion," Simply Excellent
","I haven't watched much movies for a long time and had been hearing a lot about this movie ever since it was released. and this evening, I took the chance.Directed by Garth Davis, from the moment the movie starts it gets your attention. A five year old boy, who lives in a village in India, after going in search for some food with his elder brother, finds himself in the city of Calcutta - alone. He then fights to overcome challenges and ends up in a orphanage, where he is told that he is to be adopted by a couple in Australia.The movie stars Dev Patel, Nicole Kidman, Deepti Naval, David Wenham, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Priyanka Bose, Rooney Mara and Sunny Pawar.Sunny Pawar, as the five year old boy, is simply excellent and carries his role well and is very convincing. Very powerful acting. Dev Patel, who I last saw in 'Slumdog Millionaire,' is, once again excellent as are Nicole Kidman and David Wenham and Priyanka Bose. Garth Davis and the script writers have kept to the real story on which this is based as much as possible.Conclusion. Worth watching but be prepared to have plenty of tissues at hand. A powerful story, supported by powerful cast.",10,0,0,5 August 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Mediocre - Not Bad But A Good Tribute To Carrie Fisher.
","Being an ardent Star Wars fan and having watched every single movie since the first one was released in 1977, I was looking forward to watching this one. It starts off in the normal way, which was good as it keeps with the normal Star Wars style.
Daisy Ridley, continues well to play the character that she did in 'Force Awakens,' as do Joh Boyega as 'Finn' and Adam Driver as 'ben Solo.' The late Carrie Fisher, who has been playing the role of 'Princess Leia.' ever since the first one was released all those years ago, along with Mark Hamil as 'Luke Sky Walker,' are also good in their roles. But perhaps the writers could have introduced 'Rey' and 'Luke Skywalker' earlier then they did and this could have got the public a bit more interested in the plot. The action sequences were predictable at all times, while the sound effects were excellent and worthwhile listening out for. The cinematography is also good and for those interested in it, I would suggest viewing this movie. It was also good to see some of the old and original characters back - Chewbacca, R2D2 and C3PO. The only issue is that the movie drags on a bit.
Conclusion: If you are a Star Wars fan, then don't expect much out of this but it would be worth just to see it once. And for those wanting to pay a tribute to Carrie Fisher, then its definitely worth watching. What let's this episode of Star Wars down, is not just that its dragging at times and the length of the movie itself, but also it has two plots running along at the same time.
Possible chances of next episode of Star Wars? Don't know. Let's just wait and see.",5,0,0,2 January 2018
