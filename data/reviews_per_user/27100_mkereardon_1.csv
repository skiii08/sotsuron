Child 44," I wanted to like it
","If you have read Child 44 by Tom Rob Smith, you will be appalled by this movie.The screen writing badly mutilates what was an excellent, moving story.The phony accents are ridiculous.The actors and scenery are top shelf, but it is all wrecked by the haphazard script and direction.I wanted to like this movie, but was badly disappointed.I think all screenwriters should study the movie based on the author Larry McMurtry's Lonesome Dove.The book was clearly the model for the screenplay, and nothing is lost. Whoever wrote the screenplay for Child 44 should be sent to a writers gulag in Siberia somewhere!",3,28,50,26 July 2015
