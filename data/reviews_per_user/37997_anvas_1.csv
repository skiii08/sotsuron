Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Disgusting and low
","I never been in Kazachstan, but the movie started with very typical Gypsies music and horrific misery. I doubt that this is Kazachstan culture or customs. Time to time there are sentences in Polish language as well. Really what is trying to imply this movie with such illiterate mix up of languages and accents - that whoever is anti-semitic is whatever you see in that movie. There is no cultures or nations including Jews on which somebody can make degrading fun of it. Well I regret that I spent money on this movie and I would be more than happy to know how I can get back those couple of bucks. But I found this site and for the future I will look through the comments. Because I found that I am not the only one that is disgusted by that type of movie.",1,20,43,5 November 2006
