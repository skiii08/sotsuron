The Avengers," I loved it Immediately
","First saw this movie around 4 month ago and i loved it immediately. I think this was my very first Superhero movie I saw and I gotta say, I liked it. This is a movie with a plot and actors. Which is something That has never be done i think. At least i never saw anything like that. The actors are really good in my opinion. My initial concerns were about how the movie would live up to this enormous hype it had built up. Surprisingly enough, it exceeded my expectations in a good way. The story and dialog was created with full blown Hollywood style treatment, but enjoyable and sometimes very funny. The character development was also strong, something that most directors cannot handle due to the fact that making 7 superheroes individually stand out is pretty difficult. But hey, Joss Whedon did it, so I give huge credit and respect for it. Anyways, long words short, in my opinion this was a good movie that lived up to its hype.",8,2,6,20 October 2014
Dawn of the Dead," This movie is one of my favorites
","I love zombie movies but this one takes the cake. I really like the action and how tense this movie is. The environment is nothing new, it'a a mall but for me you can't go wrong with that. It is a classic ! One good thing is the cast, they are very good. The movie it is really good, because of the style it has. The film got the right amount of gore and brutality, not too much, not to little.I saw some people saying that this movie is really scary, if you don't like horror movies MAYBE. I don't know where this film is really scary, there are some scenes where you maybe jump a bit but it's not that bad. If you want to see a good zombie and horror movie, this one is for you. This movie is for everyone- Everything but that, TOP ! This movie is one of my favorites.",10,2,2,20 October 2014
"Monsters, Inc."," A Great Funny Movie
","When the movie started I was happy and when it was over I was sad. The movie was extremely entertaining. It was funny, it was touching and it was all perfectly combined to make one hell of a movie. They have made a great movie for families and kids. Something that mom and dad can enjoy watching, but that the kids will find fun too.The story line has something for everyone to enjoy, there's no kind of person I can think of that would not find this film to be somewhat enjoyable! As far as the comedy goes, no other movie lately has made me laugh quite as much! It is truly a great movie, watch it, Every Body should to see this movie.",7,0,1,10 November 2014
Toy Story," A Great Funny Movie
","I sat down to watch this movie again - and was totally blown away. It actually pretty scary for a child movie. Sid is one of the best villains I've ever seen and Woody's jealousy is really well done. The emotions and characters in the movie are complex and satisfying to watch. I can see the point of those people who complain about it being too scary for their kids - I'd say don't watch this with under five year old unless your child is a horror junkie.My sister who is five still gets scared by the scenes in Sid's room. However, overall this is one of my favorite child movies and well worth a watch, it doesn't matter how old you are.",6,0,3,10 November 2014
Men in Black," Funny and Great movie
","Men in Black was one of my favorite Hollywood blockbusters of the '90s. Watching this movie now, it has lost none of its charm. You have to love these two stars. Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith are amazing. They are a great duo on screen. These two are awesome and you can tell they enjoyed working with each other. This movie is explosive, fast paced, thoughtful, humorous, original, and even at times wise. Final point, get this movie, you won't be disappointed.As the movie progresses you learn more about how the MIB work through the eyes of agent J(Will Smith) who is a new recruit. Who does a great job with his role while adding a bit of humor into the mix. Agent K(Tommy Lee Jone) is the really serious one of the two and takes his job very very seriously and is always serious. But the pair works well in this movie. Overall this is a fun sci-fi movie that doesn't take itself too seriously and for the most part it works.",9,1,1,10 November 2014
