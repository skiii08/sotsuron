Scarface," gotta love it
","This is a fabulous movie that you can watch over and over again. Tony Montana is the 'displaced person' made good, only to lose it all.He's fast talking,gutsy,heroic- and not a little paranoid by the conclusion of the movie. Al Pacino is perfect in this role and embodies the glitz of Miami as well as the violent personalities which inhabit this drug underworld. The depth of his performance makes you actually want him to win and to escape his terrible end. It's bizarre that he can be, in some ways, an admirable person- perhaps because his adversaries are far more unlikeable and a lot less charismatic. I might add that the scene combining a chainsaw in a bathroom is an horrific masterpiece- (bathrooms and chainsaws are not a good combination). The more I watch this film, the more noticeable seems the uneasy quality between Tony and his sister, Gina- nothing overt,but.... Michelle Pfeiffer is great as the thoroughly bored and beautiful female interest- How could anyone be bored with Tony Montana?? Yep, I love the whole package!!",9,0,2,3 August 2006
