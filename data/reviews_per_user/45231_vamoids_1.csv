The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," This is definitely an acceptable adaption to the book
","Excited, Yes! Satisfied, absolutely! Breaking Dawn, Part 1, is as faithful as can be to such an extensive text. The elements, grace and beauty are there; In the wedding, the honeymoon, the pregnancy and gory birth. We see the love that Edward and Bella share. We see the hurt that Jacob feels. We witness a life changing event in this fantasy world of vampires and werewolves. Very faithful to the emotional context of the book.As I watched yesterday, I did notice a considerable amount of the Jacob, Seth and Leah missing, but I do understand that what's in writing can't always be translated to the screen, otherwise you would have a 5 hour movie, and nobody wants that. What is important is that all the essential elements were there; Werewolf telepathy, her parents and friends, a short sex scene.This is a 'chick flick' no doubt. If you are not into weddings and kissing and cuddling, this is not for you. This is a movie for 'Twi-hards', guys that want to make their girls happy, and young women that could only wish that someone would love them like that!! I believe if you have not read the books and have just watched the previous 3 films you will get more of the same,(meaning pacing). I know some people will be disappointed with some of the missing scenes from the book, but overall, I was very happy when I left the theater. I will definitely see it again another 2 or 3 times.",Null,2,9,19 November 2011
