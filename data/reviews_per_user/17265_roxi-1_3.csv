Sucker Punch," one of the worst film ever
","I went to this movie not expecting much, but still, it was a waste of money.Somebody compared this movie with Inception because it is a dream within a dream. That's the only similarity with Inception. What can I say: bad shooting, bad screenplay, bad action scenes; just very loud music, shooting up close, too close and a girl dressed up like a bad Japanese cartoon. About acting, I cannot say much, as there was no acting; just a few lines.(this may be a spoiler) Imagine a Buddhist temple and inside a wise monk. Guess what, the Buddhist monk is a wrinkled American guy full of clich√©s!Overall, I would not recommend this movie to anyone.",1,46,94,27 March 2011
Meet Joe Black," One of the best ever!
","I've seen this movie more than 10 times and I haven't get enough of it!
Death (Brad Pitt) decides to spend a few days as a mere mortal and his target is a wealthy men (Anthony Hopkins). Little does he know that he'll fall hard for Suzan, the daughter of his victim. Now, he is confronted with a dilemma: to listen to his heart (and love Suzan for the rest of his mortal life), or to listen to reason (and to become once again the angel of death).The end lives you a bitter-sweet taste in your mouth. One one hand you're happy that he didn't take her with him (she would have died), on the other hand you cannot help but feel sorry for him, because he has to live her, to go back and continue his lonely existence.Brad Pitt is great in the role of Death. He is, as Suzan says: 'shy in the most seductive way and yet powerful' When we think at Death we don't picture it as a blond handsome guy with a stunning smile. A men who likes peanut butter more than anything and who has the candor of a child. And this contrast is what makes the movie great.Anthony Hopkins is, as always, at his best. A elegant gentleman who has the wisdom of his age. A father who love his daughters more than anything. Who dares to face Death when he realizes that He wants to take Suzan with Him.Claire Forlani (Suzan) is perfect for this role. She knows nothing about Joe and yet she falls for him. She accepts him without any questions. I'll never forget th moment when she realizes who he is. The look on her face when she accepts the inevitable: 'you're Joe!' she says smiling through her tears.Ok, enough! As you can see I'm a sucker for this type of movies: a touch of mystery, a touch of love, a touch of supernatural and I'm hooked!",10,4,6,24 June 2003
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," one of the best movies ever seen
","This is movie is great. First i did not want to go, thinking it's movie for children, but i am not sorry i went. The plot is well done, the special effects are more than great. It's a movie about courage, friendship, discovering your inner strength, so it's a movie for everybody! My advice: go see it! You won't regret it!",10,0,0,9 January 2002
