Scarface," One of the best movies EVER!!!!
","10/10 This movie tells about the man, Tony Montana, (Al Pacino),who comes from Cuba as a refugee and he wants his rights. But he goes way to far! He ends up at the top of the cocaine empire and he gets the power he wants. The movie takes place in Miami. When you finish watching this movie, you will always remember the unforgettable performance that Al Pacino played as the ruthless criminal Tony Montana. The movie has two stuning scenes. One scene involves a drug deal but it ends up costing the life of Tony Montana's friend. BY A CHAINSAW!!! Another scene is when Tony Montana defends himself against hitmen sent by a man named Sosa. A MUST SEE!!!",10,0,1,26 June 2003
