It," Movie of the year
","What did i just watch? Original IT traumatized me back in 90's so bad that i started to fear clowns and hate horror movies. I just don't know why, but some voice in my head lured me back to the cinema and watch IT again.. Now i fear my own shadow, thanks to Bill Skarsg√•rd. This movie was so juicy and evil that i'm just speechless. Easily the best movie in 2017 so far.",9,5,12,9 September 2017
