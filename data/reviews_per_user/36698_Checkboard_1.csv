The Lobster," Slow, thoughtful, ultimately unsatisfying
","You know how there is pressure to conform, find a partner and live a 'normal life'? You know how those who don't conform appear to live unsatisfying lives whilst protesting that they are not? This film takes an hour to say that, then the second hour offers no answers and has an ambiguous and unsatisfying ending.",6,1,2,16 February 2018
