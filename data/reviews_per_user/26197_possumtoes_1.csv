Requiem for a Dream," beautiful.
","Like a knife into your skin that will leave a permanent and sadly remembered scar, but one you wouldn't want removed. [the best movie i've ever seen] It may even make you worry about your mother.No stereotypes, only very real people you came to care about falling away. The imagery, the music, it all fit together just right.",10,0,0,9 October 2000
