Ford v Ferrari," Striking and Compelling!
","There aren't too many movies that have come out in the last decade that were good enough for me to want to watch them again or buy them. This is definitely an exception and its a racing movie. Well, sort of a racing movie. The cast is pretty good. Matt Damon and Christian Bale kill it on their end. Its very compelling emotionally and can definitely make you empathize with the characters. Nice to see a movie that doesn't have a political message or underlying social message in 2019. You can go read the synopsis for this movie to find out what its about, but its a great movie for people that don't even like racing. The characters are predictable and the story is rather predictable as well, but it is based on a true story of which we know the outcome and the setting lends an idea of the kind of people you are going to see. This is probably one of the best movies about racing I have ever seen. You don't learn much on the historical side of things and, honestly, that is probably a good thing. If you are looking for the story without the entertainment then watch the documentary, but if you are looking for a fun and entertaining movie with badass cars, then, this movie is for you. Btw, this movie is visually striking and shot very well.",8,1,1,12 January 2020
LÃ©on: The Professional," The gem that everyone forgets!
","First and foremost, if you haven't seen this movie, go watch it now. You will not be disappointed. Its one of the best hitman movies ever made and definitely up there with the top action thrillers of the 90's. I won't spend too much time getting into the smaller details of what makes this a classic. Where would I start anyway? Natalie Portman is excellent in this as a kid and that isn't something that typically happens. Jean Reno is at the top of his game and this will arguably be the best movie he has ever done. Gary Oldman portrays arguably the best villain of his career. He is great as a villain, but this one sticks out more than the rest. The script is excellent and it allows you to get invested in the characters and empathize with their situations. This movie will definitely challenge you on a moral level as well. I can't really tell you too much that the synopsis doesn't already tell you about the plot, but I will say this has one of the best action sequences I have ever seen at the end of the movie. Its a tragedy that The Professional isn't more popular than it is. Enemy of the State is a little underrated as well.",9,2,3,21 November 2019
