The Benchwarmers," A fun, silly comedy.
","This film is a bit like a cake, it's a bit too sweet but it has the delicious jam filling inside.the Benchwarmers isn't really a film to watch causally, more of a film to watch with your older kids. The film isn't brilliant but it's a good comedy and the acting holds up throughout, even though some of the jokes are stale and cheesy and some may not get it's sense of humour.It was made by Happy Madison productions which is run by Adam Sandler, one of the best comedy actors in the last decade of film, but the Benchwarmers is no where near as good as some of Sandlers previous titles. (AKA: The master of disguise, Joe dirt or Grandmas boy.)This film isn't really a must see for anyone, but if you want a comedy with a good plot and some neat acting you should at least rent it.(I watched the DVD version)",6,0,0,15 April 2011
Source Code," The best film this year, indefinitely!!!!
","WOW, just wow. This is probably the best film I've watched in the last decade. I love this film, I love it more than Avatar, I love it more than Dodgeball and I love it more than Hot fuzz. It was a gripping, intense and a epic thrill ride throughout.The characters were lovable, and you could feel for them, the acting was brilliant from start to finish, when they stop the train from exploding everyone in the cinema cheered, and a few where crying, including me!I have NEVER connecting with characters as much as I did in source code because (almost) every 8 minutes all of them died, over and over and over!I gave this film a ten because I can't find any faults with it!(I watched Source code in the cinema without 3D or IMAX)",10,1,1,16 April 2011
Wayne's World," A comedy for the ages.
","Waynes world is an excellent Movie experience for any fan of the comedy genre. It's a fun filled experienced unmissable for comedy fans like myself, it gets all the good things about comedy and mixes it together with romance, action and music seamlessly blended together in a brilliant concoction of cinematography.The camera and voice acting are probably what I like most about Waynes world as they really convey Wayne and Garth's dilemma.What really doesn't do it for me is some of the plot and actors. They keep trying to parody things, which doesn't work to well and sometimes the plot goes off on tangents.(I watched the DVD version.)",8,0,0,16 April 2011
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Wow, a pretty much perfect pirate Movie!
","This film is amazing. It improves over the first one COMPLETELY, and gives the Movie a little feeling of horror (e.g. Davy Jones and his crew), But in the progress it kinda loses the charm of the first film, -Which I recommend you check out-, Well anyway, This film is a must have for anyone with a sense of adventure and loves pirate Movie's.The only thing I disliked is some of the characters, They brought the guy with the fake eye back along with that other guy who follows him everywhere, They also brought back the old crew of the black pearl, along with Will and Elizabeth and the commodore!All that is great but apart from Davy Jones and his crew (And maybe the cannibal islanders) film doesn't really has much originality,it uses the same formula as it's predecessor , which is great and all but, they could of changed something more.(I watched the DVD version)",8,0,2,16 April 2011
Pirate Radio," Brilliant!
","This film is a perfect example of Britain in the 60's, and it opened up to an incredible soundtrack, lovable and well played characters along with brilliant dialogue and a terrific story.The reason I gave this a 9 is because it was a brilliant experience from start to finish and I could really feel for the pirates and I always felt sorry for the protagonist and some of the other characters.It really drew me in near the end, I thought it would finish on sequel bait, But no! it has a well rounded and deserving ending.All in all the film is a must have for fans of comedy and the 60's, I couldn't not recommend it to anyone.(I watched the DVD version.)",9,4,6,17 April 2011
Jaws," A brilliant thrill ride!
","This was the first time i've seen jaws, and it blew me away! The acting was top notch, the action and special effects were grade A and it totally immersed me in the feeling of underwater horror. In my opinion the best scene by far is the shark cage scene, the realism of the shark was brilliant.The only reason I didn't give this marvellous piece of cinematography a ten was that some times the voice acting didn't hold up with the acting or the action.All in all this is definitely a brilliant film and a must have for fans of the thriller genre.
