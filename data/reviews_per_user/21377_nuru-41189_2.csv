The Avengers," If you loved infinity war - look away now! Terrible sequel
","Completely shocked at how bad this is. Thought marvel did a great job with infinity war, with character development and tying the story all together.Endgame is the exact opposite. Back to the cliche terrible jokes, no character development. Focus on the worst actors, almost no screen time for all the most talented members of the new marvel cast.Back to the drawing board required for next avengers movie.I think anybody giving this a 10/10 must either be 4 years old or a 'bot' paid for Disney to automatically give 10/10. Genuinely awful film!! So disappointed.",Null,0,6,3 May 2019
