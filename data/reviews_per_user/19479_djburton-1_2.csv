The King's Speech," Predictable but moderately satisfying drama
","This film is pitched perfectly at the fogey set, who should lap up its ham acting, conservative tone, mild humour and emotional clich√©s. The dramatic arc of the film is understandably predictable given its historical context, but the characterization and dialogue are often slightly jarring and deter from the film's plausibility. Geoffrey Rush's performance is overplayed, and his emotional signposting annoyingly obvious. The casting of Derek Jacobi, who played one of history's most famous stammerers in I, Claudius, is a knowing in-joke, but only serves to underline Colin Firth's own flabby effort as King George VI. Best get in and see this one before the award season hype becomes unbearable and raises expectations beyond what such a small scale and ultimately forgettable film can deliver.",7,4,13,26 December 2010
Midnight in Paris," Another nail in the coffin of Woody Allen's legacy
","So, what's a once brilliant but now soggy and complacent director to do when the only people crazy enough to lend him money anymore are European financiers who insist on one dimensional, flattering, sycophantic depictions of their capital cities ? The answer to this question can be most clearly appreciated in the over-hyped, lazily scripted 'Midnight in Paris'. It is an indictment of the quality of Allen's output over the past 20 years that this film is garnering such positive reviews, but also speaks to the desire of many to see this former great of American filmmaking fire up his old magic. The central conceit of this movie is whimsical enough but quickly evaporates as it becomes apparent the excruciatingly contrived dialog and poorly written characters are only getting worse. Owen Wilson acquits himself well, but can't really rise above such weak material. It begs the question - why do A-list actors willfully submit themselves to appearing in Allen's increasingly lazy movies for far less money they could otherwise earn for their time ? There is no cachet in appearing in a Woody Allen film anymore. People should stop indulging him. Audiences would be best served re-visiting his work pre-1992.",5,3,6,10 November 2011
