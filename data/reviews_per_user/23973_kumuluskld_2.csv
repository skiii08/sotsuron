Captain Phillips," I was on the edge of my seat....
","I have to give this movie a '10'. I remember when this incident occurred. I'm not going to provide a synopsis of the movie as IMDb has already provided that.***Side note: for those of you who write a complete and lengthy synopsis of the movie before offering your review, please stop. We don't need repeated synopses in each review. Just write your review of the movie itself. Please and thanks. Also, get off my lawn. Lol. Rant over. ;)*** Some people have complained that the movie was shot in a hand-held shaky-camera kind of way. I didn't even notice that AT ALL. I'm not going to get into inconsequential technical or minor accuracy stuff. And frankly, I wasn't even really aware of any - only that which I have read on here. Do I wish that a movie about a true story would be made that is 100% accurate and depicts things as they actually happened? Yes, of course. But I think that the movie depicted the captain and the pirates in a fair way. Some people have complained about really picky things. If that's all they can find wrong with this movie, then that tells you something - that this is a good movie.I watched this movie when I was tired and let me tell you, I DID NOT FALL ASLEEP. And I was laying (lying?) on the couch while watching, which is very conducive to falling asleep for me. The movie kept my attention the entire time. From the moment the pirates boarded the ship, I was pretty much always on the edge of my seat. Not only did the pirates take Captain Phillips hostage, they took me as well. I was pretty much crying at the end along with Captain Phillips. I really felt and understood his emotions.This movie was much better than I expected. Although I love Tom Hanks, I initially only thought it would be kind of good. I wasn't real keen on watching a movie with seemingly mostly Somali pirates, especially, tbh, skinny, sweaty & stinky-looking ones with bad teeth. Sorry. But I love Tom Hanks (who doesn't) and I had heard good comments about it from others, so I chose this one. I'm glad I did.Irish, I mean, Tom Hanks, you did it again. And boo to the Academy for not giving you an Oscar nod. The ending scene put the cherry on top and you should have received a nom for that alone. I was crying along with you. The scene seemed very real to me. To the person who played Muse, I saw you on a talk show and found you to be very likable. You did a great job in the movie and congratulations on all your success.And lastly, just seeing the military ops in the movie made me verklempt and brought tears to my eyes to know that there are people like this in real life who train and work hard to prepare for situations like this. Say what you want, but this is a great country and I am very proud of it and all those who serve it. THANK YOU Seeing only four pirates in a little tiny boat board that huge ship and take it hostage really boggled my mind. I can only hope that after that incident, those ships are now equipped with weapons for protection.Be sure to eat any popcorn you get before the movie starts and finish it at least within the first few minutes. Because once the pirates board that ship, you will forget all about any popcorn.",10,0,2,6 February 2014
Inception," Cosmos FTW!
","(Not sure if this is considered to contain spoilers, so I checked the box. Read at your own risk.)First of all, I'd like to thank all those who wrote the 1-star reviews. The ones I read were hilarious! Thanks for the laughs, and I mean that! Secondly, my review is that the movie isn't so awful if accompanied by several Cosmos and you only paid six dollars for the ticket. If only I'd remembered to bring a Snuggie. And hadn't eaten so many mini-corndogs. Plus popcorn. Let's just say I did not dream too well last night.**Comes back after Preview.** What? I have to write ten lines? OK. I think I have discovered part of the problem. One must create something based only on length, not necessarily content, thus, the inception of Inception, to wit: Movie studio: This screenplay will only compute into a movie that lasts fifty-seven minutes. Screenwriter: Uh, really? OK. So I need to add something. I know! I'll make it a dream within a dream. Movie studio: At one hour, 23 minutes, it's still not long enough. People won't think they got their money's worth. Screenwriter: OK, how about a dream within a dream within a dream. Movie studio: By George, I think you're on the right track! And with Leo and Caine, we will rule the Academy! Don't give Caine too many lines, though, he'll want more money. Screenwriter: Gotcha.",4,5,11,2 August 2010
