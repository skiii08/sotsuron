Mission: Impossible III," Mission: Almost Possible
","Director Brian De Palma turns the debut of Mission: Impossible series a classic. Hong Kong director John Woo takes M:I 2 to a higher ground, where people will remember Tom Cruise acting in a very Jong Woo way, with a touch of Woo's magic seen during the early days where Woo works with Chow Yun Fatt in his Hong Kong production.Now, Alias and Lost director JJ Abrams proves that he can take M:I 3 to a higher ground. With M:I 3 being his movie directorial debut, he did it, but it seems that Cruise has lost his charm compared to the previous 2 M:I franchise.When Cruise makes the plot of M:I 3 secretive, it makes the audience worth the 6 years wait for the most explosive, most thrilling and most exciting than the previous 2 M:I franchise. This time round, Ethan Hunt (Cruise) takes on a mission to retrieve Rabbit's Foot, a bio-toxin chemical from Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a fire-arm dealer, from selling the chemical to the terrorist. At the same time, he has to hide his identity from Julia (Michelle Monaghan), his wife. The plot is as simple as that.But as expected, the presentation is not that simple. Hunt has his team mates: Luther (Ving Rhames), Declan (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) and Zhen (HK's Maggie Q) to help him in stopping Davian from selling the chemical by kidnapping him. As for how it goes, see it for yourself.Abrams proves that he is no rookie when it comes to directing a movie, especially he was given the heavy task of upholding the reputation of M:I franchise. With the top grade scorecard from Alias and Lost, Abrams brings what is needed to bring excitement and thrill to the audience. He injects tonnes of explosive actions, cross fire, betrayal and stunts into the movie. Expect the exchange of fires between helicopters and shootings on the bridge in Rome, US and Shanghai. While the previous 2 M:I features Europe and US as part of the setting, Abrams and Cruise decided to add in a touch of Asia: Shanghai. This explains why you get to see Cruise throwing himself down from Bank of China in Shanghai in his mission.While Abrams might have do a good job in directing, Cruise has show signs of fatigue in M:I 3. You will still get hot actions from Cruise, thought he might have signs of fatigue written on his body. To reward the audience for the 6 years wait of the new M:I franchise, Cruise takes the risk to perform the stunts himself.Acdamy Award winner Philip Seymour Hoffman takes the role of Davian, the villain in M:I 3, after his memorable and remarkable role of Truman Capote in Capote. A great difference from his gay, fey and voice with some childishness, Hoffman turns into a fierce, ruthless and evil Davian, who vows to make sure that anyone who is nasty to him will die the same way on how he was treated. Hoffman did it, and he will now be remembered as evil Davian apart from the fey Capote.Maggie Q adds a touch of Asia to M:I 3, where she plays Zhen, a teammate in the IMF (Impossible Mission Force). She proves to be a hot babe with capabilities, but not a femme fatale. But given her young experience in the film industry, she proves that she can do it. Her name appears on the next Asian in a mission squad, after Michelle Yeoh as Wai Lin in James Bond's Tomorrow Never Dies and Adrian Pang, a Singapore actor who was seen in Tony Scott's Spy Game, playing a doctor with Brad Pitt in a rescue mission.Laurence Fishburne appears more on a special appearance basis rather than a supporting actor, with him playing John Brassel Theodore, one of Ehtna's superior. Somehow, if he was given more appearance in the film, it would be useful to explain some of the unanswered questions in the film.Overall, some fared well while some seems to have failed the audience in the new series of M:I. This leads me to the possible creation of the next M:I franchise. If Cruise can prove that the box office and the review speaks for itself, then he is on his way to create the next M:I franchise.",7,0,2,6 May 2006
Brokeback Mountain," Heartbreak Mountain
","Ang Lee turns the heartbreaking short story from Annie E. Prolux's Brokeback Mountain + Close Range into a heartbreaking drama that touches the heart of every man, with Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal as the heart breakers kept in the closet.It is really amazing for Ang Lee to turn a mere 55 pages short story into a 134min drama, of two cowboys who finds love among themselves during the period where they take care of a bunch of sheep in Brokeback Mountain. They found passion among each other and they shared their happiest moment together. Soon, their job comes to an end and they go separate ways.Both Ennis (Ledger) and Jack (Gyllenhaal)hide their feelings for one another during their respective marriage with Alma (Michelle Williams) and Lureen (Anne Hathaway). While Ennis is torn between his fidelity with Jack and Alma, Jack never seems to find satisfaction from Lureen, who has a well to do background. He finds fulfillment from the gigolos in Mexico, and that marks the threat to their relationship.Ang Lee is not selling homosexuality in Brokeback Mountain. More rather, he let us see how love can be powerful outside heterosexual context. Though i've not personally watched his previous homosexual-themed drama The Wedding Banquet, i could see that Brokeback is not your typical homosexual-themed drama or gay haha comedy, where a happy ending among a gay couple just simply passed off the whole film. It does not sell or glorifying homosexuality, but more rather, it reflects homosexuality and the pressure it faced during the 60's to the 80's. If Brokeback Mountain is just simply a gay drama that features nothing but endless gay sex, glorifying homosexuality through husband divorcing his wife and go live with another man, then Brokeback Mountain has failed terribly, and at the same time, defy Prolux's initial idea of penning down Brokeback Mountain. Compared to the novel, Ang Lee and his scriptwriter Larry McMurtry & Diana Ossana adds in more details to back up some points that surrounds the story, without destroying Prolux's idea. This further enhanced the film on the forbidden relationship that lasted for decades.Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal shines in the film, with Ledger as the more reserved Ennis, who puts his family in his first place on top of his love of the more talkative, outgoing Jack. While Gyllenhall took the role of Jack, his appearance to continue his relationship with Ennis not only makes Alma cry and kept Lureen back in the dark, but also putting their relations at jeopardy. He questions himself on his fulfillment in love and lust on both Ennis and Lureen, which earns himself a nomination for Best Supporting Acotr in 2006 Acdamy Awards. Michelle William's breakthrough role of Alma earns her an nomination for Best Supporting Actress, where her helpless cries on Ennis fidelity with a man could not be heard. She finds an escape to that through constant overtime work, which eventually ends her marriage with Ennis. For her breakthrough role, she is putting herself onto the world map from her previous unknown roles in her earlier movies.The film breaks the heart of the audience, and breaking the mountain into pieces means they are making several award statues for themselves as well. Brokeback Mountain is one of the rare gems that could make such a remarkable achievements.",9,25,29,24 February 2006
Pan's Labyrinth," The Labyrinth of A Innocent Child and Vicious Adults
","Pan's Labyrinth proves to be a fairy tale for adults and matured kids, or should i say, a fairy tale strictly for adults only? Guillermo Del Toro takes a very different approach in his 2nd tale revolving innocent children and adults with vicious hearts after his previous The Devil's Backbone. With both movies share the similar time line (where both stories were set in Spain during WW2), Del Toro once again brings the audience to the mysterious underworld, through the eyes of a child.Devil's Backbone tells us about ghosts. Pan's Labyrinth tells us about fairies and demons. OK, enough about wandering ghosts and spirits seeking vengeance. We had Ofelia, a little girl who was said to be the princess of the underworld, where fairies lives together. However, in real life, she was a daughter of a late tailor and a housewife who became a Captain's wife, who rules a army belonging to the Fascist power. When Ofelia discovers a labyrinth with a bug that was actually a transformation of a fairy, she was drawn into the other world where she found out that she was a princess. However, she must pass through 3 test to regain her position of a princess.Del Toro led the audience into a world of fantasy that was bizarre and amazing. Truly convincing and attractive, it draws the adult back into childhood memories, just like the bedtime stories told by the parents. However, Del Toro do not want to make the fantasy world too attractive, that people do not want to come back to the reality world. Thus, he blended and matches few characters, such as the Captain and Ofelia's mother, Mercedes (Captain's housekeeper) and Pedro, who are siblings joining the side of the guerrillas fighting against the Fascist power.Ofelia's innocence and Captain's cruelty makes the movie a big comparison of human beings inner world. While Ofelia goes all the way to pass through the test, the Captain would do anything to save himself and his power. Every single test everyone goes through in Pan's Labyrinth tells the audience that life is not a bed of rose, where everything comes with a price. And to survive, they have to pass through the test, just like how Ofelia gone through the test, and survival of the human beings during war time.The underworld puts the audience back to childhood, where Del Toro has successfully captured the heart of the audience, making them wanting to stay for the movie. However, reality seems to be longer than fantasy, as it was presented in the movie, where Ofelia's contact with the underworld takes up slightly lesser than half of the total duration of the film.The tour of the labyrinth gives the audience a not so sweet adventure, with distasteful scenes related to war violence. But still, it is fun and exciting to explore them.Take the opportunity to explore the labyrinth, and surprises awaits you.",8,2,4,20 January 2007
Closer," So close...that it's world apart
","The tag line of Closer states When you believe in love at first sight, you never stop looking. It lives to the tag line, but not everyone has the equal opportunity to showcase their talents in Mike Nicolas's latest drama.Natalie Portman steals the limelight in Closer from Julia Roberts. She has grown up from her previous role in Star Wars, where she was better known as Queen Amidala and Mathilda from Leon: The Profession. She takes the challenge of playing a woman looking for love in London, where she worked as a waitress and a stripper. Her role of a woman looking for love becomes the main attraction, where audience would focus on her over Roberts, who plays a photographer passing through the post-divorce phase. Robert's performance is plain, without giving more scenes to explore her talents further. Her role also explains why Portman over shines her.Jude Law is still the main focus in the film, even though Clive Owen is catching up. Playing a reporter and a doctor respectively, both are connected to Roberts in certain ways: Robert's was Law's photographer for his upcoming book, Owen is the victim of a prank by Law, where he was arranged to meet Roberts. In any case, the trio (Roberts, Portman and Owen) are related to Law, but the trio may not necessarily be close to each other. This results in a complex relationship the 4 involves, and bears the consequences they would never forget.Mike Nicolas brings the British drama play onto the big screen with confusion. The relationship itself is confusing, let alone the presentation itself. Flashbacks were inserted directly into the film, without any elaboration before the appearance of the flashback. In fact, certain issues were not mentioned, and it just happens. However, the plot has saved the movie from failing. The gripping performances of Portman and Owen has not only gained themselves an Golden Globe award each, but also makes the audience wants to go for more.The choice of using Damien Rice's The Blower's Daughter as the theme song is another factor why Closer deserves my 7/10 grades. 'I can't take my eyes for you'has sold the idea of the movie to the audience who is not too sure of the plot. The arrangement of the song at the end of the film also gives the movie a full round-up of the film.",7,1,1,4 March 2005
Burn After Reading," Destroy After Reading
","The Coen Brothers are back with Burn After Reading, after the Oscar winning thriller, No COuntry for Old Man.To create Burn After Reading, the brothers used the following formula to tell the story: Osbourne Cox (John Malkovich), an CIA agent, was dismissed by CIA + unhappiness with his wife, Katie (Tilda Swinton) = Obourne's decision to create a memoir.Katie's infidelity with her friend, Harry Pfarrer (George Clooney), behind Osbourne's back + Osbourne creating a memoir = Memoir burnt into a CD.CD - do not know how the CD ends up in a female lockers in a gym = CD landed into the hands of 2 gym workers, Chad (Brad Pitt) and Linda (Frances McDormand) CD x (Chad + Linda)+ thought of highly classified secrets = extortion from Osbourne.Extortion - failure to extort from Osbourne = sell the CD to Russian Embassy at a higher price.Katie removed Osbourne out of his life X acts to make his life miserable = Osbourne in frustration.(Linda X Harry)/ spying from some mysterious character = Terror and fear.Osbourne in frustration + Terror and fear + Selling the CD to Russian Embassy at a high price = Disaster.It takes time and patience to work out several complicated formulas, which gives you Burn After Reading. The Coen Brothers are quick to solve the formulas, but it seems that they might had missed out some details or two, which leaves several questions to the movie.Are they selling a dark comedy with the story that falls towards Fargo? Sort of. To me, Fargo and Burn deals a type of issue: one needs money (whether they need it desperately or greed makes them wants the money.)and gets the money through the wrong way, which ends up getting more than they bargained for.While Fargo features only McDormand and William H Macy as the leading cast, the Coen Brothers throws in more A-listed actors and actresses and eye candies to spice up the story. It is a good thing to have them, but too much of it and not handling them properly just spoils everything.No crossover between Clooney and Pitt, little crossover with Clonney and Malkovich. The lack of direct face to face interaction between the 3 leading actors just ruins the expectation from the audience. And why no face to face interaction between McDormand and Swinton? It is sad to say that with a list of A-listers, there are not much chemistry among each other. It seems that McDormand's interaction with Pitt and Clooney is the only reason that prevents the movie from getting a total failure.Burn After Reading seems to make one remember as a movie by Coen Brothers with a group of A-listed cast, but easily forgotten, compared to the impact the Coens created when Fargo was released to the public in 1995. So, one can simply destroy after reading it.",6,4,8,11 October 2008
Split," Split Personality, Confused Identity
","After exploring the lives of the boy who sees ghosts and the man who survived several man-made accidents, director M Night Shyamalan creates a thriller based on a person suffering from Disoriented Identity Disorder (DID). SPLIT was born under this idea, which aims to gives the audience a good understanding about DID, but ends up leaving the theater feeling confused. Three teenage girls – Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy), Claire (Haley Lu-Richardson) and Marcia (Jessica Sula) were abducted by Kevin (James McAvoy) at a car park. Locked in an unknown underground cellar, the three girls discovered that they were greeted by Kevin in different forms under different names: Kevin dressed up and acts like a straight man, a woman, a child and a gay guy. The girls soon discovers that Kevin is suffering from DID, which he lives with 23 personalities. Meanwhile, Dr Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley) is seeing Barry (one of the personalities under Kevin), a young artist who claims that he is suffering from some personality disorder. While Dr Fletcher is trying to prove that a person suffering from DID have the ability to change their physiology, the three girls are using his various personalities to rescue themselves, before Kevin's 24th personality comes after them. As the title suggests, SPLIT was interpreted as someone with DID is living with split personalities. Though it was understood that McAvoy's Kevin was living with 23 personalities, only 8 personalities were seen in the entire film. With 8 personalities on display, this is not only challenging to McAvoy in terms of interpreting the respective personalities, it is also challenging for the audience to digest and understand the reason behind the distorted personalities. Audience were treated to McAvoy's interpretation on the different personalities he is living in, and how his respective personalities interact with his victims. However, this has starts to bore the audience, which some will find it time consuming and lack of interest, since everyone has more or less expected what will happens next. The first five minutes of the movie gets straight to the point directly, showing how the girls were abducted without any reasons. While audience were expecting to see how the girls are finding their ways to escape from their abductors, Shyamalan works differently compared to other movies which talks about how victims find their way to escape from their abductors. Audience were given an exploration on the lives of Kevin through his counseling appointment with Dr Fletcher, which was intervene with Casey's childhood experiences. The only link that brought Casey's childhood into the movie was towards the last ten minutes, showing how is she escaping from Kevin's 24th personality. With the overall presentation not shown in sequence, it is easy to make the audience feeling confused and distorted. McAvoy's portrayal of Kevin lives under different names through his different personalities. While it was mentioned in the synopsis that Kevin is suffering from DID and lives with 23 personalities, only 8 different types of personalities were showcased in the film. From playing a straight man, a lonely man, a woman, a child to a beast, McAvoy's performance was the only reason that kept the story from going on. Anya Taylor-Joy's performance of Casey is more of a compliment to the story. Her wit not only helps her to understand Kevin, but also serves as a way of saving herself in the times of danger. Somehow, the intervention of Casey's childhood trauma fails to compliment the story well, which overall it drags the duration of the film. To sum up, SPLIT has a hard time to identify its identity, which the movie is rather confusing. While McAvoy's performance saves the day and Taylor-Joy gets more screen time, this is another movie which Shyamalan is having a hard time to connect with his audience and fans.",5,22,67,17 December 2016
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," It Makes Us Looking Forward to The Girl Who Set Fire on the Hornet's Nest
","It takes a great challenge for a movie director to do a remake of a popular movie, especially when it is based on best selling novel. David Fincher has taken the challenge to do a remake of the highly popular Millennium Trilogy, and he did it. He has delivered a splendid American remake of the Swedish drama series, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo. Daniel Craig takes up the role of Mikael Blomkervist, and Rooney Mara plays Lisbeth Salander. Together, the trio have given us the feel bad movie of Christmas.The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo marks the first chapter of Millennium Trilogy, with Mikael the journalist and Lisbeth, a computer hacker, working together to investigate the case of a missing girl, Harriet Vanger. Harriet was believed to be murdered by one of her family member when she goes missing 40 years ago. At the same time, Mikael is under trial for defamation of a entrepreneur, while Lisbeth is surviving from a rape which could have unlikely to happened on her.While Fincher gives a fully explained details in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2009), which was based on a short story written by F.Scott Fitzgerald, it takes a challenge to summarize a 644 pages story written by the late Swedish author Stieg Larsson into a 2hr 38 min movie. Fincher not only did it, but also makes the US remake truly lives up to the novel. Audience get a better understanding on Lisbeth's lifestyle and attitude towards her surrounding, such as being reserved at work, living as a bisexual computer hacker, survives from rape and develops affection on her working partner Mikael. To understand how Mikael turns Millennium magazine into a magazine that exposes corporate scandals, it can be seen from the way how he investigates the disappearance of Harriet Vanger. This is how we see Fincher wants to tell the audience on the working style for Mikael without repeating Mikael's working style, which was featured at the beginning of the novel.Editing plays a very important role in this US remake. In the first half of the movie, Mikael and Lisbeth were presented as two different persons with very different lifestyle, which goes concurrently without overlapping each other. Towards the next half of the film, both met each other by working in the investigation on the disappearance of Harriet Vanger, which eventually leads to the discovery of the sinister secrets of the Vanger family. The pace is fast, direct without making one feeling bored. Rather, it engages the audience, making them wanting to know more. This is another reason why the movie is a success. What it lacks, however, is a deeper exploration on Lisbeth's personality. While it was explained in the Swedish version of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, it was not seen in the US remake.In some way, the US remake makes up what was lacking in the Swedish version. The opening credits are created specially for the US remake, compared to the usual credits run over on movie scenes. This gives audience the reason they should arrive the theaters early to catch them. Observant audience will know that the opening credits covers the title of the trilogy: a dragon tattoo on the black female body (The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo), a burning matchstick and a burning body (The Girl Who Played With Fire) and hornets flying out of a girl's mouth (The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest). The credits are marvelously accompanied by Karen O, Trent Renzor and Atticus Ross modern reprise of Led Zeppelin's The Immigrant Song.With a marvelous US remake of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, it gives us the reason to look forward to the US remake of The Girl Who Played With Fire. Now, all we want is to revisit Mikael and Lisbeth, the unlikely pair, to unveil more dark secrets.",8,2,8,8 January 2012
Batman Begins," Masculinity rules here.
","Batman Begins is the only Batman episode where masculinity rules among the Batman series.Compared to the previous 4 Batman series, where we see heroines in the franchise, Batman begins is the only episode where no heroine is introduced. Katie Holmes is the only actress in this film, thus making this film unique. The rest of the cast? All males. More male roles and duologue's thus answer the headline: Masculinity Rules Here.While Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher directed the previous 4 series, director Christopher Nolan injects in excitement and fresh looks in the 1st chapter of Batman franchise. Christina Bale takes the role of Bruce Wayne/Batman, Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes and Cillian Murphy as Jonathan Crane. Not to forget the Japanese veteran actor Ken Watanabe, playing Ra's Al Ghul Compared to other comic book to big screen adaptation, Batman Begins has successfully pull the adult crowd into the cinema, with veteran actors such as Liam Neeson, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman and Tom Wilkinson taking the supporting roles. So far, this is the only adaptation where several veteran actors were placed together and given supporting roles which helps us to see the rise and fall of Wayne. It has proved that comic book adaptation are not mutually exclusive to teenage audience only.Christian Bale gives the audience 2 types of fresh look on Batman: 1) a young Batman in his early years, and 2) famous celebrity need not necessarily take the role of famous comic book characters. While Michael Keaton, George Clooney and Val Kilmer has taken the role of Batman in the previous series, the former child actor took the leading role despite his little popularity.One great thing to say about Batman Begins: Christopher Nolan has salvaged the rotten reputation of Batman/Catwoman series, proving that Batman series still rules in Hollywood, despite there are several comic book adaptations onto the big screen now. While Tim Burton creates a memorable and remarkably good series, Joel Schumacher and Pitof (director of Catwoman) pulls the series down, causing the audience to lose faith in Batman series. Nolan brings back the action, suspense, excitement and breath taking endings to the 1st chapter of the franchise.More effort has to be put in if there's going to be more Batman series in future, but Nolan has make audience want to go for more.",8,0,2,27 June 2005
Before Sunset," A short and sweet treat which can be longer.
","After they left 9 years ago in Vienna, Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are back in Paris, for a mere 80 mins in Before Sunset. Together with the director Richard Linklater, the trio continues in the short and sweet meetup, beginning from the bookstore in Paris. Comparing with their wildness in Before Sunrise, Jesse (Ethan) and Celine (Julie) shows maturity and responsibility has taken place after the 9 years separation, by listening to the topics they discussed: sex, love, romance, politics, and meanings of life. With a non-stop sequence of the 80min drama, Before Sunset shows us the 5 places both Jesse and Celine went to to talk about the meaning of life: cafe, park, small cruise on the river, Jesse's private car and finally, Celine's apartment. Before Sunset makes us think what we have done in our life, and the responsibility we shoulder as time goes by. It has indeed make a good drama on love and life, together with the beautiful scenery on streets of Paris and a short glimpse of French's lifestyle. However, it is a pity that the movie lasted only 80mins, as the story takes place on Jesse's short and little sparetime that he has before going to the airport, returning back to the US. Overall, Before Sunset has brought us good script, good cast and beautiful scenery, but the duration can definitely be lengthen.",9,0,0,9 November 2004
Revolutionary Road," Sailing Down to Revolutionary Road
","Sam Mendes make an adaptation on Richard Yates novel into a movie, and pairs the couple who melted the hearts of millions with the 1997 blockbuster, Titanic. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet had a reunion in Revolutionary Road, which finally, Jack and Rose has become husband and wife, under the name of Frank and April Wheeler.Set in the suburban of Connecticut during the 1950's, Revolutionary Road is an exploration on a couple seeking a better life, which is to fulfill their dreams by migrating to Paris. One can easily compared Revolutionary Road with Mendes first big screen work, American Beauty (1999.) Frank and April settles in Connecticut, with a big house, 2 lovely kids, a job that has no problem putting bread on the table. However, Frank do not like his job, while April is drowning herself in sadness when she is unsuccessful in becoming an actress. Things take a drastic change when both decided to migrate to Paris, with 2 issues hindering their plans: Frank getting a promotion and April getting pregnant. What falls ahead of them are countless challenges on their relationship of an unhappy matrimony.One will never be disappointed with any movies from Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, since both has never delivered disappointing performances. With their outstanding performance in Titanic, Revolutionary Road will never disappoint anyone who is expecting more from the couple.Sam Mendes discussed the issue of an American dream turned sour in American Beauty, where he introduces a failed husband seeking a breakthrough for himself, a wife who wants to break free from a loveless marriage, a daughter with growing up issues, infidelity, erotic dreams and drugs. Things take a turn in Revolutionary Road, where similar issues were discussed.Together with the scores composed by Thomas Newman, one could see the shadow of American Beauty in Revolutionary Road. The husband having a quarrel on the dinner table, the wife who wants to fulfill her dreams at the expense of her husband to a neighbor who is a former mental hospital patient, we could easily see the linkage between American Beauty and Revoultionary Road.While American Beauty begins with an brief introduction of The Burnham's family and their neighborhood, Revolutionary Road begins with how Frank and April knowing each other in a party. The next scene begins with Frank and April, now a married couple, facing the problems they had in their marriage. Mendes is taking a twist in terms of presentation for both movies discussing similar issues.Just like the environment in Revolutionary Road, it was peaceful and calm, where one would slow down their paces and enjoying what is around them. Mendes handles the nature of the story and present it in a way where one will not feel much harsh elements in Revolutionary Road, compared to the straight-to-your-face reality featured in American Beauty. This can be told by the unexpected ending for the movie.Sailing down to Revolutionary Road is not as disastrous compared to taking the maiden voyage in Titanic. While one will wrench in Titanic, they will appreciate the beauty of Revolutionary Road, which will not be easily forgotten.",7,0,1,22 April 2009
Million Dollar Baby," The baby who can't reach the million dollar target
","Million Dollar Baby is Clint Eastwood's most recent appearance on big screen after Bloodwork. Witb the strong cast of Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman together with Eastwood himself, it was supposed to be one of his best films he made.However, i would say i prefer his previous production, Mystic River.Million Dollar Baby is more of a journey of how Maggie Fitzgerald, which was portrayed by Hilary Swank, becomes a female boxer, whom she insisted to be trained by ex-fighter, Frankie Dunn (Eastwood), who now runs a old gym, together with his previous fighter, Eddie Scrap (Freeman). This somehow goes a distance from what the plot should be.Million Dollar Baby do not have the suspense of Mystic River, but magnifies the ugliness of human being. From the style of how the boxer fights, the training session in the gym to Maggie mother's attitude on preferring money over a new house when Maggie bought a new house for her family members, Eastwood brings in the ugliness to the audience through the group of less fortunates social level.Hilary Swank makes another excellent performance after her award winning role in Boy's Don't Cry. Morgan Freeman, on the other hand, seems to be suffering from malnutrition in terms of dialogue. He doesn't have much dialogue in the film, and neither did he make any breakthrough performances. However, he narrates the film, which will be discuss later.Now back to Eastwood. His performance as a former boxer cum Maggie's coach has not been affected by his 'cowboy image' from his previous well-known cowboy shows. But in terms of direction, it brings back the wordy dialogue, minus the suspense.What makes the movie watchable was the narration by Freeman. Beginning with how Eastwood becomes a trainer, Freeman tells the story of the main characters through his eyes and his experience. If the film was narrated by Eastwood, it would gives us another side of the story, which can make Million better.In all, the baby fails to earn an million, but managed to earned 3/5 of a million.There are times where",6,1,4,9 February 2005
The Dark Knight," Checkmate
","And the dark knight wins.With Christopher Nolan and his group of strong leading cast, he has proved The Dark Knight to be a sensation. Countless full house midnight and late night screening, rave reviews, strong supporters...it's no wonder that The Dark Knight has proved to be a favorite for most.Christian Bale is back as Bruce Wayne/Batman again. Together with his butler Alfred (Michael Caine), Lt Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman), his inventor Lucuis Fox (Morgan Freeman) and his all time love Rachel (Maggie Gyllenhaal), he has to fight against his new enemy: The Joker (Heath Ledger).In The Dark Knight, expect to see more action and personal conflict compared to Batman Begins. Here, The Joker wants Batman to reveal himself using the threats of killing innocent civilians before he creates havoc on Gotham. This has eventually boiled down into Bruce making the decision of revealing his identity. With the introduction of District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), who wants to pull down the crime rates of Gotham, Batman has another alliance to fight the crime.There won't be any dull moments in The Dark Knight. What you get is a 153 minutes fast paced thriller that will keep you going from the beginning to the end. And expect lots of explosion in the film.One of the main focus of the film is the superb performance delivered by the late Heath Ledger as The Joker. Here, we do not see The Joker commits a crime for the sake of doing so. He is a terrorist that puts Gotham into panic. Using the gangs and corrupted officials to achieve his goal,he wants to challenge, and ultimately, get rid of Batman. And it does not comes with a small price to pay for Ledger to bring Joker to live. In previous interviews, Ledger has done several researches, such as getting close with mentally disabled patients. This has been his best, and unfortunately, his last performance.WHY SO SERIOUS? : Christian Bale has also make Batman series a success. As Bruce Wayne, he is a smart successor who enjoys life, but also faces his deepest fear when The Joker shows up. As Batman, he will fight against The Joker at any cost. However, apart from fighting against The Joker, he will be faced with another new enemy: Two Face.I BELIEVE IN HARVEY DENT: Aaron Eckhart makes his Batman series debut as Harvey Dent, an attorney who will fight crime at all cost. Dent is another leading character whose role could be explored further, if not better in the film. Eckhart's role carry a weight to the overall performance of the film, but could be better. This has been Eckhart's best performance in his movie career.The change of actress for the role of Rachel did not affect the film, as Maggie Gyllenhaal delivers a performance with a punch. Not to forget the contribution of their performances from Caine, Freeman and Oldman too.Overall, it's worth the 3 years wait for The Dark Knight. And one last thing that we are curious: who is the next villain Batman will fight against?",9,2,6,19 July 2008
Grindhouse," Double Thrill and Scare for the Price of One
","When Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez created Grindhouse, they are bringing movie fans the culture of grindhouse cinema, which explores B-flicks, which usually accompanied with explicit sex and violence.Tarantino comes out with 'Death Proof', a thriller about 8 girls who met a psychotic stuntman coming after their lives with a car. Rodriguez whipped out with 'Planet Terror', about a group of human beings fighting their way out from human beings infected with a virus that turns them into zombies.And it is a 3 months difference for 'Death Proof' and 'Planet Terror' to be released in cinemas in Singapore, for Grindhouse was separated into 2 different movies outside US. But, at least, we are fortunate to watch 2 full length version of the movie.Quentin Tarantino - 'Death Proof': In summary, it is about 8 girls who had 2 different encounter with Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell), a diabolical movie stuntman who gets the thrill of killing girls in his stuntman car. The first encounter took place from a pub, where 5 girls meet up for a drink, and Stuntman Mike follows. He executes his plan and 14 months later, he picked up the other 3 girls from a convenient store.For fans of Tarantino, Death Proof is the mirror image of his 2 previous production, Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. The wordy conversations of the girls about men, career and life takes up most of the duration of the film. For those who are expecting thrills and actions seen in Kill Bill, you will be slightly disappointed, for there isn't much action over here. However, you will still get the thrill from the breath taking car-chasing scenes. Just bear with it if you are not used to wordy dialogues in Tarantino's movie.Robert Rodriguez - 'Planet Terror': About a group of military personnel lead by Lieutenant Muldoon (special appearance of Bruce Willis) which releases an experimental bio-weapon onto the town, which turns human beings into cannibalistic zombies once contracted to it. Cherry (Rose McGowan), a go-go dancer, lost her right leg to some zombies in an accident. She was send to the hospital by her boyfriend, El Wray (Freddy Rodriguez), where the hospital sees several people infected with the bio-weapon, showing symptoms of becoming a zombie. As more people becomes zombies, Cherry and Wray gathers the remaining survivor not infected by the virus, including a married lesbian doctor Dakota (Marley Shelton) and her father, Sheriff Hague (Michael Biehn), Lewis the cook and other surviving personnel. Together, they will have to get rid of all zombies and leave the town.Compared to 'Death Proof', 'Planet Terror' fills in more action, thrill, gore, sex and fun. Rodriguez do throw in interesting and witty dialogues in 'Planet Terror', so as not to make it look so dull, such as 'it's go go, not cry cry', as spoken by Cherry to a survivor when getting the truck from the zombies.But a Rodriguez movie without lots of action is not a Rodriguez movie. With the style of gun shooting from his El Mariachi trilogy and Sin City, you get something new in Planet Terror. For example, Cherry had a machine gun fixed on her right leg and with her go-go dance skills, she does a one-woman show against the zombies.Rodriguez also takes references in other classic horrors and thrillers, such as John Carpenter's Assault on Precident 13, George Romero's Land of the Dead and popular drama series, General Hospital. With the combination of the 3 show, you get one of the memorable scene, where the hospital turns into chaos, where zombies attack the human beings.Grindhouse: In whole, Tarantino and Rodriguez have revived the definition 'Grindhouse' in their feature. This was seen by creating scratchy prints on their movies, poor quality prints melted under the heat with the old projectors, discolored prints in certain scenes, and missing prints. This is something that is considered unacceptable and avoidable with today's technology. Grindhouse also means that the grindhouse cinema is part of the unique culture in the cinema history, where movies that were forgotten remains alive with the help of grindhouse cinemas, such as the Chinese kung fu classics from the 70's to the rare foreign fares that has little market value in the cinema industry.To make Grindhouse a real and memorable experience, 4 bogus trailers were created. Sad to say, only 'Machete' was featured before 'Planet Terror' in Singapore, while no trailers were seen before 'Death Proof'. 'Machete' is another B-thriller starring Danny Trejo as Machete, an ex-Federale who was betrayed by his boss who hires him to assassinate a senator. Survived from the attack, he gets his best friend, a priest, to take revenge on his boss.2 films and 4 bogus trailers for the price of one. This is a rare treat to movie lovers. For those who want some mindless fun, go for 'Planet Terror'. For those who want some space for thought, go for 'Death Proof'. If you want to have a great experience, go for Grindhouse. It will not disappoint you.",7,0,0,29 September 2007
The Departed," Asian Tale with American Life
","The 2 men behind the Hong Kong box office drama Infernal Affairs, Andrew Lau and Alan Mak, will be pleased with Martin Scorsese for giving new life to the Asian trilogy.The Departed is an adaptation of Infernal Affairs Trilogy, where Leonardo DiCaprio's Billy Costigan is the role of Tony Leung Chiu Wai's Chan Wing Yan, while Matt Damon's Colin Sullivan reprises the role of Andy Lau's Lau Kin Ming. Jack Nicholson's Frank Costello is an Italian mafia, which is an answer to Eric Tsang's Sam, a Hong Kong trial society's kingpin. Martin Sheen's Oliver Queenan is the equivalent to Anthony Wong's SP Wong in the American adaptation.Scorsese has given a new life to Infernal Affairs trilogy, where he concluded the whole story in 152 minutes, rather than making it into a trilogy adaptation.Firstly, it was a full American flavored, where the story was presented in American context, instead of sticking closely to the Hong Kong version. FBI, Italian mafia and grocery store is the answer to Hong Kong Police Force, trial society and illegal gambling dens. By using something that is closer to home, Scorsese tells a story from Asia with American background.Secondly, bits of elements from Infernal Affairs 2 and 3 was seen in The Departed, such as Costello being a womanizer and the short conversation between Queenan and Costello with Dignam (Mark Walhberg). This may not seem sticking close to the trilogy, but it shortens the time taken to know the tale behind the trilogy.DiCaprio, Damon and Nicholson may be the whole focus of the film, but it was Walberg's Dignam that leaves the audience with the deepest impression. A hot tempered and fouled mouth inspector, he was not seen in Infernal Affairs trilogy, which adds a new twist to The Departed. Vera Farmiga's Madolyn is the combination of Kelly Chen's Dr Lee Sum Yee, the psychiatrist Chan was seeing, and Mary, the lover of Lau.Scorsese ends the film with an unexpected twist, which has proved a success to The Departed. If Infernal Affairs has impress you, The Departed brings Infernal Affairs to a greater height.",8,0,1,14 October 2006
War of the Worlds," Spielberg+Cruise= Need to look out for areas of improvement
","Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise is a pair of fantastic duo when making sci-fi dramas. However, unlike their previous box office hit Minority Report, there are areas of improvement for War of the Worlds.They remake the Paramount classic, they turned a sci-fi fiction by H.G Wells from words to action, they used Dakota Fanning and Tim Robbins, and in the end, they need to look out for certain areas, cos War is not as great as Minority.First of all, the storyline is there, but it lacks details. We do not see Cruise playing an big screen hero, but more rather, a minor character who is escaping the attacks of alien tripod machine, together with his son and daughter from his ex-wife. The whole movie is about how a family escape from the invasion of alien tripod machines, which were hidden under the earth for millions of years. When the machines attack human beings, they began the journey of survival.The story may/may not sound common, but it has lacked details for certain scenes. What is the role of Tim Robbin's existence in the story? Who is he? How much does he help them? How does he know about the future of the earth? How does he knows that the alien tripod machine is coming after the human beings? The lacking of details in the film leads to the second point: it leaves the audience with loads of questions. Justin Chatwin, who plays Robbie, son of Tom Cruise, insisted on joining the army to fight against the tripod machine. An explosion follows. How does he survive? And when most of the cars are unable to function after several lighting strikes, why is it that the car found by them can function? What has happened to all of the tripod machines at the end of the film? It was not clearly explained. From the duration of 116min, the sci-fi thriller left several pointers unanswered.While Spielberg and Cruise has answered the pointers in Minority Report in detailed, nothing much was described on War of the Worlds. Even having a cast of experienced actors such as the young Fanning and Robbins, the Oscar winner, it does not help in covering up the faults found in the film.Compared to Minority Report, where the background was set in future, War of the Worlds do not have much visual effects. But there are some scenes that's worth waiting for. Look out for the scene where the tripod alien machines awakes from the earth, and attack the people. Also, look out for how the highway bridge collapse at the neighborhood when the Ferriers (Cruise, Fanning and Chatwin) are escaping.If more time was given to the duo and the casts and crews, War of the Worlds can exceed audience's expectations, and do much more better than Minority Report.",7,2,6,2 July 2005
The Reader," The Reader and His First Love, written and portrayed by a group of marvelous team!
","Chapter 1 - It was Berlin, 1958. A young, totally drenched Michael Berg (David Cross) left the bus and falls sick on the basement, at the block of apartments where he lives. Saw him feeling sick and in pain, Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet) brings him home.Chapter 2 - Few weeks later, a fully recovered Michael brought some flowers to thank Hanna for her help, and passion develops. From then onwards, Michael runs to Hanna's apartment for physical intimacy every time he had an opportunity.Chapter 3 - Each time Michael meets Hanna, he would read her a book. From The Odyssey by Homer, D.H Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover, to Anton Chehkov's The Lady and the Little Dog and Tintin the comic, Hanna widens her knowledge, and develops an interest with Michael and his reading session. But when the large age gap and the differences in viewing an issue, they were torn apart, and Hanna left the apartment, starting a new life.Chapter 4 - 8 years have passed. Michael, now a law student, attended a court hearing session on the trial of the Germans who had assisted in the massacre of the Jews during World War 2. To his surprised, he saw his long lost Hanna, now sitting together with a group of ladies, who were put on trial. What will Michael do? Based on Bernhard Schlink's Der Vorleser, The Reader is a American big screen translation of Schlink's novel on the search of true love and uncovering the truth. All told in a life span of 38 years (where the story begins from 1958 and ends at 1995), director Stephen Daldry enlivens the novel, through the smooth flow of the past to the present. With an excellent performance of Kate Winslet, Ralph Fiennes and David Cross, The Reader has live up to it's name of being a Oscar nominee for 5 awards, including Best Picture.Here, we are seeing how Michael, now a lawyer, is trying to help a illiterate Hanna to discover the wonder of books, and how it helps her to explore the outer world, rather than surrounding her life working as a dull and boring bus ticket conductor job. As a kid, his curiosity of exploring the opposite sex has driven him into a physical relationship with a lady who is 20 years older than him.To show the audience how Hanna explores the world of books and getting in touch with the world of reading and writing, Daldry presents to us a 30 something Hanna wanting to quench the thirst of literature through her almost daily physical intimacy with Michael, and starting to write at an old age, where the novels were read and recorded in cassette tapes. This is the important point where Hanna has found the meaning of her life towards her feelings for Michael.While Ralph Fiennes delivers a superb performance as adult Michael Berg, it was Kate Winslet and David Cross who has graped the heart of the audience. Kate Winslet portrays Hanna, where from young to old, she was looking for something to clear her conscience. David Cross as young Michael Berg, was seeking remedies to retain his first love and finding the truth on Hanna's decision. Fiennes's appearance as a adult Michael Berg was more on preserving the first relationship with Hanna.Not to mention that The Reader were produced by the late Anthony Minghella and Sydney Pollack, which both passed away before The Reader was completed. Of course, this makes The Reader a highly recommended drama to catch it on the big screen.The Reader was there for you to find out the truth, and to explore the world of the famous authors, who brought us classic literatures which no one would easily forget.",8,1,2,1 February 2009
The Wrestler," When a Man Falls...and Picks the Glory Back Again.
","Darren Aronofsky's The Wrestler marks his fourth full-length feature film. With Mickey Rourke to reprise the role of Randy 'The Ram' Robinson, a aged wrestler who is picking up the glory back again, The Wrestler has become one of the best film made in 2008.Aronofsky has been well-known for bringing surprises to the audience in his previous works, with Requiem for a Dream (2000) bagging several awards for his shock factors in the drama on the disaster due to over indulgence in drugs, sex and slimming pills. Today, The Wrestler will make audience see how a man brings back the glory he enjoyed 20 years ago thru violence, failed relationships and doing something he had never done before.Randy (Rourke) is a former wrestler who now teaches wrestling to school kids and in neighborhood areas. Once a famous wrestler, he no longer enjoyed much fame he had compared to 20 years ago. Occasionally making appearances in wrestling match, Randy suffers a heart attack which could have left him dead if he goes wrestling for another round.Thus, he decided to do something he has never done before. First, falling in love with a aged stripper Cassidy (Marisa Tomei in her most daring role ever). Second, to patch up his estranged relationship with his lesbian daughter, Stephanie (Evan Rachel Woods). Working as a supermarket worker in the delicatessen department as odd jobs, Randy wants to get back his pride that he has lost. When both relationships doesn't work out well, he decided to go back to wrestling, even though he knows he is taking the risk of playing a game with death for the second time.The Wrestler is a story on a fall of a man from his glorious times, and how he wanted to get back the pride he enjoys formally. Emotional struggles were presented in endless wrestling matches, frequent visits to strip club and unable to communicate with colleagues at work. These are some ways on how Aronofsky want to tell how a old wrestler who finds comfort in expressing his emotions, thru acts and habits he is familiar with.One shouldn't expect Aronofsky to tell the story in a very smoothing and pleasurable way, which is healthy for the eyes and the mind. Expect a fair amount of violence and sex in The Wrestler. Violence is something a professional wrestler will feel alright with, which is sad to say, a part of his job. The scene on Randy having a match with his opponent at a surrounding filled with shattered glass, barb wires, stapler and razors serves as a thrill for the fans, at the expense of their health and body.Randy's romance with Cassidy shows that he do not mind his lover's profession in a sleazy club which the main purpose is to service and satisfy man's most basic needs. It is sad to see that when a wrestler makes a living out of his body, he is falling in love with someone who is making a living out of displaying her body. Sad, but true. If anyone is looking for a very simple boy meets girl dating movie, The Wrestler will not be your choice.From their heydays to making lists of B-movies, Rourke and Tomei are making a comeback in The Wrestler. Rourke, famous for his classic performances in Adrian Lyne's 9 1/2 Weeks in 1986, is making a comeback in The Wrestler. With his experience in acting in B-listed movies for more than a decade, Rourke's experience has been put to a good use by Aronofsky. Using only 35 days to complete the shooting of The Wrestler, Rourke do not need much practice in playing a role of a wrestler getting back his glory. He is putting life into the story, which has truly gained him a Golden Globe Awards 2009 for Best Actor.Marisa Tomei makes a breakthrough as Cassidy, an aged stripped. It is not a wonder that many feels that being a B-listed actress, she appears naked in a role that serves as a sex object to the public. However, it is rare for such roles to gain a recognition by the juries of the Academy Awards, and Tomei has proved that she can do it.It is not easy to watch The Wrestler if one is simply looking for the thrill they want in a wrestling match. Yes, you got the action, the violence and the gore. But it was the sweat, tears, years of loneliness and struggle that makes The Wrestler the recipient of Golden Lion Awards in 2008 Venice Film Festival.One do not need to watch any wrestling competition to watch this independent movie. Knowing the emotions and struggles is more important than knowing the wrestling skills to watch the wrestling match in life.",7,0,0,14 February 2009
Inception," Inception: Where Human Minds Create Wonders
","Christopher Nolan has the penchant of playing mind games in his previous three movies: Memento (2000) , Insomnia (2002) and The Prestige (2006). Inception is Nolan's fourth production which brings mind games in the next higher level.The story of Inception is rather original, touching on areas which many have not explore before. It is further enhanced with a group of A-listed cast, including Leonard DiCaprio, Ken Watanabe, Marion Cotillard, Ellen Page, Cillian Murphy and Michael Caine. With Joseph Gordon-Levitt (of (500) Days of Summer) and TV actor Tom Hardy as the leading cast, Inception is a sci-fi thriller which is presented without much confusion due to the various characters involved in the story.Dom Cobb (DiCaprio) is a master thief who specializes in stealing ideas from the victim's dream, when the victim is in a sub-conscious state. After the plan of stealing an idea from Japanese businessman Saito (Watanabe) fails, he was given one last chance to redeem himself: not to steal, but to implant an idea on Saito's rival, Robert Fischer Jr (Murphy). With the help of his group of specialist (Gordon-Levitt, Hardy) and the recruitment of a student Ariadne (Page), the team began their heist on the implant of ideas, which comes with enemies they had never seen, or prepared for it.Inception is not your usual boring summer blockbuster flick which throws in loads of cliché plots and predictable endings. The concept may seen very similar, just like any other movie focusing on a heist. However, the catch is Nolan creates the story, using the background that not many filmmakers will touch on: dreams and state of consciousness. The Matrix Trilogy (2000 - 2003) had cover on dreams and consciousness, and no other movies has touched on similar issues. Now, these areas are once again, being explored and brought to a new level.Nolan awes the audience by creating state of sub-consciousness in layers, which means a dream within a dream. Ideas in real life becomes the setting and background for a person in their dream, where what has happened in real life will determine what will happen in the dream. An example created by Nolan in this case: a person will be flooded in their dream when he/she was woken up by water in real life. This seems magical, and at the same time, logical. Thus, to enhance the thrill the audience are experiencing, Nolan creates a new level of sub-conscious state the team will be experiencing by what is happening to them, which in someway, looks like a chain reaction in different sub-conscious levels.DiCaprio's role of Cobb is the center of the story, where his decision will affect the people around him, together with the outcome of the heist. While he is creating the most perfect crime to salvage himself, he will need to overcome the grief of the death of his wife, Mal (Cotillard), which can be his potential enemy. By implanting the role of Mal in the world of Cobb, we can see how Cobb is crippled by the thoughts of Mal, while trying to create the perfect heist.Both issues discussed above creates the labyrinth within the movie itself, where audience are brought to a labyrinth, and they have to figure out on ways of getting themselves out. While the labyrinth is created in the movie for the team to avoid and deter the attack of unknown enemies, the audience is brought to the labyrinth, where they need to figure out what happens next. Certain form of interaction between the team and the audience exists in Inception.Though the audience might not get much action sequence in Inception compared to Nolan's previous acclaimed production, The Dark Knight (2008), an interaction has been created for the audience, which is something that is very much lacking in the movies we are watching in cinemas today.If the summer blockbusters playing out there fails you, go for Inception. You will have fun and you will never regret, for there is always something new for you, waiting to be explored.",9,5,10,16 July 2010
Valkyrie," For the People, They Are Doing Something No One Will Ever Dream About
","Finally, director Bryan Singer has brought us something that is different from his previous comic adaptations.Entitled Valkyrie, he is putting a true story of the assassination of Adolf Hilter onto the big screen, telling us a World War 2 story not many people would know. Not forgetting that casting Tom Cruise as the leading character Colonel Claus Von Stauffenberg boasts a large selling point to the historical thriller.Together with 2 British veteran Kenneth Branagh and Bill Nighy as Major-General Henning Von Tresckow and General Friedrich Olbricht, the trio forms a team to make us of Operation Valkyrie, a emergency plan activated by Adolf Hilter when a coup takes place. Using the operation as the backdrop of an assassination, the trio are trying to take over Adolf Hilter when assassination is a success, so as to prevent the Germans from suffering under the hands of the Adolf Hilter under his regime, and spared from the punishments of the Allies should the Allies taken over Germany.In the previous comic adaptations by Singer, his movies features loads of explosion and action, which are the key factors contributing to the box office success. However, Singer skips the explosion and actions in Valkyrie. Keeping them to the minimum, he grab the attention of the audience by keeping the pace of the story tight and not lengthy.The film begins with Claus (Cruise) severely wounded during an attack in North Africa, leaving him with an blind eye and a broken hand. When he feels unjust on how he was treated by the Nazi party for his efforts in the war, he was recruited by General Friedrich (Nighy) into a plan to assassinate Adolf Hitler. At the same time, both are recruiting more military personnel's who are opposing Adolf Hitler.Knowing that the assassination could lead him to glory if he succeed, dead if it fails, he send his children and his beloved wife Nina (Carice Van Houten from Paul Verhoeven's Black Book) off before he began his assassination.All of these were kept short and direct, where audience were spared from details overloaded, leading to boredom and loss of concentration on the film. At the same time, details of the coup and the assassination were delivered in a smooth flow. Little explosions and exchange of fire were included in the film, thus sparing the audience from the unnecessary violence.Most would compare Valkyrie with Zhang Yimou's Hero (2002), where both story shares the same idea: to assassinate a country's leader who brings misery and endless war. As the presentation of the story is concern, Valkyrie provided a detailed historical facts where one can expect the assassination to be a failure. Hero, on the other hand, focuses on a fiction tale on the assassination of Emperor Qin Shihuang, China's first emperor.While Zhang Yimou presents the assassination of the Emperor in a much exaggerated sword fighting scenes, glittered with colorful and artistic visuals, the 90 minutes drama it has lose some audience who are seriously into a good story of a failed assassination. Valkyrie presents to us in a very direct, no frills presentation where human emotions and conflicts will keep your fingers crossed at all times. Even though one will expect Operation Valkyrie to be a failure, Singer spares us the pain that some would go thru in Hero.Cruise's role as Colonel Stauffenberg is a deja vu of his partner Carice Van Houten's previous role in Black Book. While both roles shares the same goal, Cruise seems to have failed to catch the emotions on his revenge for the country making him a handicap. More rather, his aggressive behavior makes him feel more like a general wanting to hold the dictatorship to rule a country.One will be disappointed if you want more of Houten's appearance after her remarkable performances in Black Book. Here, being the only leading female character, her appearance and lines were kept minimal. Kenneth Branagh and Bill Nighy, on the other hand, gains more exposure to the film.Overall, Operation Valkyrie might have failed, but it will definitely be something that people will remember, as a coup that overthrows Adolf Hitler, and a historical thriller that display's Singer's talent in his resume.",7,1,3,14 February 2009

V for Vendetta," V For Victory
","The Wachowski Brothers and their Matrix trilogy assistant director James McTeigue brings out a treat to the audience with V For Vendetta, after their previous disappointment The Matrix Revolutions.In the British-German production, they have marvelously used British actress Natalie Portman as Evey, a British TV Station crew as the sidekick of V, a victim of a failed experiment who was arrested for being a guerrilla terrorist with the skill of defense and deception, who later becomes the hero of V For Vendetta, leading the people to overthrow the tyranny and autocratic government. Australian actor Hugo Weaving takes the leading role of V, where his true look was never revealed in the film.It is set in the futuristic world, where England is ruled under autocratic power of the chancellor, Adam Sutler. No one in England had full freedom in their country, where curfews are imposed in the country with no mercy if one is caught on the streets during the curfew hours without a very good reason. Evey is one of the victims, who was saved by V.V took control of the TV Station Evey works in, and encourages the people to stand up and fight against their tyranny, Nazi-liked government for their freedom. V achieved his objectives through terrorism acts, and took revenge on the group of people who used him in an experiment which kills thousands of non-British in the experiment. As Evey slowly gets to know the story of V, she must also overcome her fear, where her parents died under the rules of the government for sharing the same idea as V.James McTeigue makes his directorial debut in V For Vendetta, where it amaze the audience with scenes on how V influence the people with his ideas and acts. If you are expecting the scene where thousands of people wear the mask that signify V in the trailer and the teaser poster, McTeigue do it for you, thanks to the experience he had when working in Matrix Revolutions. Together with The Wachowski Brothers and Joel Silver, who is also the producer of Matrix Trilogy, the tense and excitement from Matrix Trilogy has been brought into V For Vendetta.After seeing him playing the notorious Agent Smith in Matrix Trilogy, Hugo Weaving is casted as V, where we do not get to see his face in the film. We, as the audience of the film, was questioning ourselves: did he do the dubbing for his role, since he has to wear a mask throughout the whole film? It is a bit disappointing that we do not get to see the look of V under the mask.Being a British herself, Natalie Portman brings out the fear, agony and pain she suffers under the tyranny rule of the government. Not much of a breakthrough, but the scene where her hair was shaved when she was captured is definitely worth a watch.The film seems to be targeting against the rule of the Nazi power under the lead of the infamous dictator Adolf Hitler. The rule of Nazi power has been brought forward to the modern day England, where the advancement of society seems to have failed stopping the ideas of Nazism in the modern world, where Nazism has been condemned around the world. It is rather unique, or should i say, that terrorism is the remedy to Nazism. I am not influencing or encouraging terrorism attacks to achieve ones objective, but V For Vendetta presents to us how terrorism acts could destroy a rule of terror, but at the same time, questioning ourselves, do we want to live in a world of terror where no security exists among everybody? It is sad that V For Vendetta suffer cuts under the censorship in several countries for the idea of using terrorism to overthrow a tyranny government.V now marks Victory for the cast and crews to out stand itself above other boring commerical flicks.",7,3,15,14 March 2006
