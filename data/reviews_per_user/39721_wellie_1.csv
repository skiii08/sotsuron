Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Chinese Theater - question
","I really liked the movie. It's was for my special, because I saw the movie in Los Angeles. I flew on the 24th May early, my birthday, and I arrived (for the first time) in LA still on the 24th! and saw in the Chinese Theater the best movie of the nineties. In Holland this movie is due until 30 September!? I'm certain to see the movie for the fourth time in London on the 16th July.You can't compare it with the 'old' trilogy, you shouldn't, but the effects (Podrace scene) are great. Bravo Lucas!!!(stupid?) Question: why is Dark Sidious not mentioned on the credits. Is this the same character as the later to become the evil Empire?Best regards!",Null,0,0,17 June 1999
