The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Unfolding story of learning about our place in the world
","For many movies we see a lot of negative/positive comments, and that is to be expected in life, where few are the same, and uniqueness is rampant. When the plot involves love, something private for most of us , then it shouldn't be surprising to see often negative comments, about a otherwise wonderfully crafted movie both in terms of writing and acting , and everything in between.I fell in love with the entire series from the beginning, not because its sappy teen love or contains amazing special effects/makeup art, but because of the story it conveys to the reader/movie goer. It's not a story about superficial love and having sex, its about the journey of getting somewhere fulfilling and non superficial; of self discovery In this fast paced world, sometimes we forget there is more to love than just the act itself, that it embraces the better part of ourselves, that has no relation to hot lights & pornography , that instead its a story unfolding of interpersonal relationships and the growing as human beings in the process.I suspect like you, we am drawn to the charisma, the hope and the expectation that its going to have the proverbial 'happy ending'. Isn't that what most of us watch movies for honestly, to see some variation on that theme, and if we don't acquire it, hope that the movie contains some message about why ; because after all the happy ending isn't set in stone, and at least discovery, not always from ourselves can be a blessing in disguise as we all set out to discover who we are, and where we fit in in this sometimes fragile existence we call life.That's in part what entertainment is all about, and this latest offering in the series, does not let down.",10,2,8,1 March 2012
The Hunger Games," Poignant, and often gruesome modern day Roman gladiators ,asking should we
","In todays world , where classes divide people, we have middle income America, and on each end , the poor and the elite on the far end of the spectrum.Often the two rarely meet or have much in common, but no one cares when you enter a fight for your life, and in this movie those that are vying for the right to life, are but mere children. If that notion scares you as a mother or a teen, this movie may not be for you . I personally think that while the movie doesn't leap to the level of 'saw' or similar types, its enough to have possibly warranted a R rating. I would certainly think twice about taking a teenager, because some scenes are extremely vivid.That sad, while I went into the movie expecting horrific things, I admit to being overall impressed with the take away.The harsh reality sets in as a opulent and lavishly dressed 'announcer' shouts names from a list of teens to be involved in a gruesome last-teen-standing duel. We are then presented with a short 'video' explaining why all this has come to pass , and that those involved in this 'battle' most violent, are there due to a treasonous event of their ancestors. A high price to pay for civil disobedience, though we aren't told the details of any of it.You do not need details, when its rather clear why everyone is there and the cruelty about to unfold, and I suspect those details will be present in some 'sequel'.As I sat watching, I was pleasantly surprised to see not just another gruesome violent fest, but real philosophies being presented; as in out of the mouthes of babes . These aren't all just willing participants, but in a few cases, reluctant, sometimes to the point of rebellion at great risk of bodily peril.'Players' are thrust into a environment ( after coaching), not unlike the gladiators of ancient Rome. It's quite unsettling given the age group of the people involved, but it sets a proper tone for what is to come. The innocent of youth, thrust into the barbarity of war, and those 'in charge' with their opulence and extremes, poised over their materialism to the exclusion of the safety of those about to fight.The movie includes not only great acting from a young new cast, but exciting visuals, exciting if not basic plot line and amazing visuals of a world seeming full of technology, yet some questionable morals.To consider ones death yet remain true to their nature, as well as wishing a end to the sickness , where rooting for a victor , yet sadness when a entrant succombs, are expressed sentiments.This is no pure gore fest, but do take care in taking those young adults who may need to wait a few years before seeing something so visually troublesome. Everyone else will see a movie that on the outset may seem gruesome and violent, yet inside containing questions of us all, in a sometimes world where injustice and elitism rule the day.A decent see not for its violence, but the questions asked by the participants.",7,1,7,18 April 2012
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," disgusting and without merit:do not see this mess.
","If a movie is based on a true story, I give leniency to the content of course as long as the rating is accurate, but this one of course being fictional is just ridiculously over the top gruesome.I realize, as some have noted, that the blood is SO Hollywood , that it does descend into a a 'D rated movie effects budget' scenario, but still not even the brilliant acting of Depp and his cohort can pull off such a disgusting display of violence.I enjoyed the first half hour or so of the movie or so, as while it was clear the character was disturbed for reasons of sad injustice done to him, it does in no way defend the gratuitous use of violence and blood when its clear more impact ( and done in a way to allow it to retain a PG rating , and get more of a poignant point across ) from a musical point of view could have been achieved, along with the movies amazing use of mood.I really wanted to give a rating of at least 2, but even given a outstanding amount of acting in this film, I feel it was wasted 100% on nothing more than appealing to people who either want to scare their girlfriends, themselves or just sick people in general.Alfred Hitchcock did amazing things with the birds, and while it did yes contain some shocking scenes, it was at least within the realm of possibilities, while this film makes a point to avoid rationality and just go purely for the shock value to try to appeal as noted before, to a certain audience; shame on burton and depp.It's definitely not worth buying, but if you don't mind renting it and wasting $8~ ( for a movie thats only worth the first half hour or so ) that is fine as its a decent movie right up until the gratuitous slashing starts.",1,17,32,24 August 2008
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Good movies don't have to always be about unending violence
","I find it not only disturbing , utterly fascinating ( in a very bad way) and completely without logic that someone would complain , - and often with little or no indication of education based on use of grammar and foul language, that they didn't like a movie regardless of its thoughtfulness and amazing set direction, lighting , mood , great characters/acting, stunning action sequences, special effects and amazing storyline and set locations just because they are jealous that a romantic romp through the lives of two torn individuals manages to triumph in the end through seeming unachievable challenges somehow messes with their preset ideologies that movies must be only about gratuitous unending pulse-pounding violence and similarly shallow plots.The rest of us loved the movie because it showed commitment to another person, the better part of ourselves doing something we may not like, but that its the right thing to do and is the encapsulation of love in all its glory. The heroine understood the consequences, but accepted the reality of it based on faith in love and her ability , - with love in tow to rise above the murky dark facade that for a time alluded the struggle for happiness. No one in their right mind would suggest this is appropriate under all circumstances ( this could be very dangerous to try at home HM ) and we surely accept that along with our agility to sail through life with lessons learned under our belts and the better person we become for it, that some of us will grab a certain gusto of life possibly wrought with some degree of peril, not because our brains are hardwired for high risk at any cost, but because we are hardwired to want to love and be loved. This is not just a movie for teenage girls as some have provocatively and incorrectly suggested, but for any couple or any person yearning to see something clean and viscerally elegant because it speaks to our heart.If you don't get that then maybe you should consider some introspection, and look at the man(or woman) in the mirror, because the rest of us appreciate and admire a broad sweeping emotional love story because it just feels good when love triumphs in the face of possible adversity or learns some valuable lesson ; - our sail truly then set for success, running ( slight pun , slightly unintentional ) as a solid framework for the rest of our lives.",10,5,15,28 November 2009
Clash of the Titans," Entertaining flick about Greek mythology
","Hearing about the movie, as relates to 'wrath of the titans', I decided to see this, and I'm glad I did. I went into it , expecting what I got; pure adrenaline and entertainment. If you go into it looking for precise mythological representation, you may be disappointed, but then aren't most people disappointed when they see a movie after reading the book, - and given the small time period for a movie, why are you ? ;) I knew this going in, I sat there looking for entertainment, as most of us do when we goto the movies, and was most certainly not disappointed. The acting seemed a tad stiff in places as if a given actor was trying to find a reason to be excited about their role, but that's a very small nit, as overall the acting is wonderful, by a stellar cast.The plot is as you would expect from such a movie, as it does not delve too far into the mythos, yet gives you enough information, along with stunning visuals , to be clearly entertained for the entire 1.5 hours. The Greek mythos adage about gods not feeling loved enough is clear, is simple in its comprehension yet is great content for a action experience. I never felt like I wanted to leave the room, nor did anyone else. I remembered the original quite well, and while in some ways it was better than this remake, what's clear is the attempt to yet again, entertain and in that it achieved that quite well.I do think the snarky comment about the poor metal owl, though honestly semi humorous, was I thought a bit misplaced and in a way slightly ruined the energy the movie had going up to that point. It's not even close to a deal breaker, but having seen the 1981 original at least twice, felt like the owl omission was unfortunate, but I do understand that they were concentrating on other plot points and do not fault them for that per se. The owl, for me at least, gave the movie a distinct feeling of empathy, as I, like I imagine many others, were rooting for the owl, as the stalwart companion. We all love our animal companions after all, which brings us further into a position of empathy as movie goers, yet no matter, as they more than make up for it in other respects.I recommend seeing this if you liked the original, are okay with something unique regarding plot twists, and love special effects as they lend a hand to magical mythological portrayals.",7,0,1,3 April 2012
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," If you like a good romance novel full of special effects action scenes laced with edge of your seat horror, your in for a treat
","Hello movie going fans !If you are considering seeing this movie, look no further than this incredible review :Great , and expected continuation from last movie; no surprises there and also zero letdowns, as we see the plot unfold and the love triangle evolve very nicely, with a moving and mature moment near the end between script protagonists. Great acting with evolved actors and characters. Great special effects as you can imagine and this one continues to entertain without fail. A romantic action enhanced thrill ride you won't want to miss having seen last 2 movies, and if you are new to the series, make sure you catch up before seeing this one as you wont be disappointed since there is something here for everyone.I continue to be exceptionally appreciative of overall toned down horror visuals that otherwise could have been extreme and it reminds me a lot of Hitchcocks: 'the birds' which was also rated PG yet easily maintains that 'edge of your seat' theater without resorting to effects that insult the viewers intelligence. It proves we don't need over-the-top-gore to create incredible movie experiences. I love Jacob's character, regardless that they are all enthralling and I was hoping she would choose him honestly , because I would personally rather see her stay human at the end of this very rich plot, and if you are like me having not read the books, we shall just have to wait to see how things unfold in the last entry in the series.Highly recommended family viewing for morals portrayed , keeping in mind youngsters because the movie does earn its PG rating although with great class.Grab your favorite movie going companion and off you go! ;)",10,6,17,3 July 2010
