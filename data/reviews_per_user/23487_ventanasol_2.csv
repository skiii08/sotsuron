Men in Black 3," give this a miss
","I wasn't expecting much and I got less than I expected. a handful of smart one-liners doesn't make up for 90+ minutes of tedium. On the plus side Josh Brolin has TLJ's accent down to to a tee. On the other hand Emma Thompson is wasted. TLJ is definitely looking his age. Will Smith doesn't look that convincing either The insults to late 60s idealism are cheap and unfair. The whole thing reeks of a cheap attempt to make a few more bucks out of the franchise. The time-travel thing is a bit of a clich√©. Shame really because TLJ and WS have good chemistry. They need a fresh scriptwriter. Unimaginative movie, I should have just watched MIB I again.",4,11,24,30 May 2012
Molly's Game," An unexpected pleasure
","Just back from seeing this movie. I was hooked from beginning to end. Reminded me of Casino in two ways. First, both films focus on an individual whose income depends on gambling. Second, both lean heavily on an ongoing voiceover narrative by the main character (Robert de Niro, Jessica Chastain). Unconditional recommendation.",9,0,4,9 January 2018
