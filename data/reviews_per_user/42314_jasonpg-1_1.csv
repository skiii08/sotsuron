First Man," Great Subject Matter - Poor Cinematic Execution
","I'm a bit of a space junkie.I've traveled to Kennedy Space Center, and remember watching the Shuttle launches on the edge of my seat growing up.I love seeing the human side of Neil Armstrong, and the interplay between his family life and his professional life. Astronauts do extraordinary things, but at the end of the day, they're human, just like anyone else.What I didn't love was the execution, namely, the camera work. I saw this in a large format theater, and the hand-held camera work for the vast majority of this film was jarring. As a viewer, I shouldn't be aware of the camera. But in First Man, I was definitely aware. It was uncomfortable at times.The cinematography also felt claustrophobic at times.",7,6,13,15 October 2018
