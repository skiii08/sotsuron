The Ring," why is it scary?
","There are no words with which I can describe this movie. Maybe 'amazing' or 'brilliant'. The Ring is an absolutely perfect film about the 'invisible' which makes you scared. I think it has had a part in the movie-history with its innovation after the bloody horrors and own atmosphere which is the most depressing I have ever seen. Because you're afraid of something you cannot see.I was just 12 when I saw it the first time - everybody spoke about this film, how scary it is, and that it's a story about a tape which kills you when you watch it - and it was a memorable day for me. I had thought I would be afraid of it, but then I wouldn't. It was something else. With its blue-green hues and fantastic music has ever composed to a thriller, I just felt sadness and depress. And yeah, it was scary in an other way. But not in the word's normal meaning. It created such a kind of atmosphere that no movies have ever did and I think they won't. That's why it is a perfect creation. And this film is gonna be the movie like the X-Files which everybody saw and made them scared in their childhood.Having watched it I heard that it's a remake and years later I watched the original version. But I realized I don't care it's a remake. Who cares? The Ring is an excellent movie and to tell you the truth I didn't find the original film good. It was very different than the American version. It wasn't bad but the director understands the message in an other way than The Ring's. And Ringu is also based on a novel so it can be announced as a 'remake' too. Two film, two messages.The most interesting thing about The Ring is that actually you cannot explain what you afraid of. Are you afraid of a tape? A simple object? Ridiculous. But it is the truth. A tape makes you scared. With its disturbing pictures, noises, sounds and elements. I think that this short movie is a kind of art work. Fantastic how the director can transform everyday happenings into disturbing elements. It could have won an Oscar.I like the actors playing. I think David Dorfman acts very well as a child, and I don't think we have to discuss anything about Naomi Watts. She is perfect too. Nothing overacting. And when I watched it years later when I became older I found another message about The Ring.I found it sad. It is a sad story. A mother kills her daughter. Why? Because the horses bear themselves nervous? That's not enough. It is a sad story because a mum cannot stand her kid and she feels the only way to be quit of is death. And then she commits suicide. A series of deaths. Because of a little girl. Lots of unexplainable happenings. And with them I've told almost nothing about the movie.And why is it scary? I have no answer. Complicated, original, unexplainable, brilliant. The Ring itself is the answer.",10,1,2,17 September 2010
