Ford v Ferrari," Loved this movie!
",Rarely go to movies unless I have high expectations. I'm also a car nut so I already knew the story. This movie exceeded my expectations and dramatized the story perfectly. The interactions of Damon and Bale kept me glued to my seat along with excellent racing scenes. I never once noticed how long the movie is and now that I'm wished it was longer. Great entertainment!,10,3,6,16 November 2019
Drive," Mesmerizing!
",Just watched this movie and was shocked to find out it was made in 2011. This movie really should have made a bigger splash because it is awesome! Yes it is different and that explains the bad reviews from viewers who only want to see the usual formula. No thanks. This movie is edge of your seat but requires adult patience until the end. If you wait you will be rewarded slowly as the story unfolds. Every actor is well cast and 'gets' what the director is creating. Well done everybody! Pretty sure I'm going to have to see it again because I want more!,10,4,6,1 January 2020
