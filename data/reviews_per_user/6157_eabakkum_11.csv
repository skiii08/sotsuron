Saturday Night Fever," A working class tale
","I must definitely write a review about Saturday Night Fever. This film was the talk of the town in my teen years. Right after the release I saw the film once, together with a school mate, in the neighboring city. There was no cinema in our village, and our film journeys invariably transformed into a pleasant evening out. The usually preferred menu were James Bond films, but that time SNF was a must. We enjoyed ourselves. It has everything you could wish for. Music of a proved band. A new style of dancing that we could imitate (how little were our talents in this regard). Even sex. Enough chances for identification and enough stupidity to maintain a feeling of superiority. The guy who made a girl pregnant, but took aversion to marrying her and fell into a state of contempt of death. There are real character moments when Tony lacks power: Tony begging his boss to get advanced money. Or Tony, although among equals of a cool attitude, getting slapped by his parents and whining. About 25 years later I recorded the film on video, and watched him some seven times, at short time intervals. At first it was just nostalgia, a reminiscence of the good old times that are lost forever. Then it was the film itself: lots of movement and fun and actions. My involvement with SNF finished with an analysis of the intriguing relation between Tony and his new dance partner, and a dissemination of the dialogs (what do they say and why?). The characters are certainly credible and well-played. It seems to me that the film comes close to a working class tale and a criticism of American society: the apathy, lack of education, the brutal surroundings, the struggle for mental survival, and of course the desire to get out. It is essentially a good-natured film, which still portrayed some hope in the aftermath of flower power. The right film at the right time.",9,0,1,7 August 2010
Casablanca," A review should stick to the facts, and bar emotions
","I inherited the DVD Casablanca from my father. My parents belonged to the war generation and were liberated from the German occupation by the American army. Consequently in the fifties and sixties they received every American novelty with awe. American films had a cult status, and certainly Humphrey Bogart, and definitely the war film Casablanca. Bogard has a good name. He said rightly: 'You are not a star until they can spell your name in Karachi'. Dave Chasen said of him:'Bogey is a hell of a nice guy until 11.30 p.m. After that he thinks he is Bogart'. In Cacablanca an American hero turns out to be a veritable chevalier as well. So these are my tender emotions, when I watch the film. However, all generalizations are false. A review should stick to the facts, and bar emotions. And in the light of day the script of Casablanca looks a little shaky. The town is portrayed as the center of human trafficking, which is evidently a dirty business. Therefore it seems slightly unlikely that the local bar owner would have a heart of gold, like Bogart. Joke to make this review even better: a penguin walks into a bar, and asks the bartender: 'Have you seen my brother?' The bartender replies: 'I don't know. What does he look like?' In addition the film characters of Bogart and Bergman are somewhat unpleasant. Bogart keeps reproaching Bergman how she has hurt his feelings. A normal person would be glad to have gotten rid of her. Never buy a car you can't push. And Bergman is unable to chose between her two lovers. In the end she leaves the decision to Bogart, which is either preposterous or cunningly clever. Sometimes the best helping hand you can give is a good, firm push. A normal person would assume, that apparently her two lovers are both inadequate. Fortunately, even when a film has an unconvincing narrative, it can still be saved by the quality of the separate scenes. In this respect Casablanca has definitely some excellent moments to offer. A face can say so many things. Especially the mouth part. Therefore it still deserves a positive recommendation. Play it again. Don't forget to leave comments. I love it.",7,0,2,19 November 2015
Citizen Kane," The climax happens at the beginning
","Citizen Kane can be called a film with an outstanding reputation, and in addition fifteen years older than me. So I feel somewhat embarrassed that I did not watch the film before last month. This is even more so, since the political genre is my favorite. Now, after having done my duty, there is the mission to write an original critique. Hopefully at least my loyal followers will pardon this stale addition to the plethora of reviews. Actually the climax of Citizen Kane happens right at the beginning. A boy lives with his simple parents. Although the couple is not really degenerate, there is a hint that the father is a somewhat violent educator. Anyway, the mother is glad when a benevolent Maecenas offers to adopt the boy. Thus Kane is separated from his elderly home, which causes a mild shock. Nevertheless, he succeeds in making an excellent career for himself as a newspaper tycoon. His stories are dynamite (take a flea out to dinner; do you still enjoy my review?). The pen is mightier than the sword, and considerably easier to write with. But the love that he receives from other people can not fill the emptiness due to his lost childhood. He lives in a conspicuous wealth, but this fails to bring meaning to his life. He becomes adamant (the very first insect). But why continue to dilate (= live long)? In the end the bitterness has grown upon him, and he dies in total isolation. Thus the film is quite melodramatic. Maybe in those days the film producers still had a knack for theatrical techniques. Or perhaps some years after the great Depression, that is so thrillingly portrayed in The grapes of wrath, there really was a class society with appalling differences. True capitalism is survival of the fattest. And of course Orson Welles is a giant, the man who said: 'There is one thing worse than celibacy: marriage'. Don't forget to leave comments. I love it.",7,0,2,14 November 2015
MASH," An outcry of despair
","Mash is not merely a film, it is an institute! Nowadays it is difficult to imagine the dispiriting effect of the Vietnam war. A whole generation of young Americans grew up in fear of being drafted and killed in a senseless battle. After each presidential speech for peace more troops were sent to the front. Many famous films express this depressing experience in repulsive pictures: Apocalypse now, to begin with, but also The deer hunter, and Coming home. And yes, Mash. It describes the Korean war, but everybody knows it is about Vietnam. At least wars teach us geography. This film really solidified in the subsequent popular TV series. It is one of the rare attempts to make fun of the devastation on the Vietnamese battlefield. For this purpose a military hospital is chosen as the film set. Hospitals are good fun. The humour is of a bizarre type, which rejects the existing order and institutions. Patients can be misused for jokes. The condition of dead men is called 'stable'. A sucking chest wound is nature's way of telling you to slow down. The military hierarchy is also in the focus of the pranks. Superiors are ridiculed, in spite of the military demand for respect, even if he were your father. But the events are just as averse to marriage, fair play in sport, religion, prudery, honesty or private property. The middle-class morals are sacrificed, and no certainty is left. Even the nurses are offensive ('It is just a rash'). Evidently the army will never be a virtuous organization. It is true that military intelligence is a contradiction in terms. But Mash takes this mark to the extreme. Mash shows the wrongs of life. I admit that this can be helpful and beneficial. Moreover, the story contains many sentimental appeals, for instance to protect the weak and truly vulnerable. Nevertheless, the moral degeneration in Mash is painful to watch. Why not lecture by means of exemplary behavior? Still, although it may seem ambiguous, I recommend this illustrious film, since Mash so well embodies the then outcry of despair.",7,0,1,5 April 2017
The Polar Express," This haunts us in our dreams
","The cartoon film The Polar Express is not a conventional Christmas picture. Then the question is: what is wrong, the film or Christmas? I like The Polar Express, because it is a very spiritual story and film. It retells the events, that so often come to haunt us in our dreams. You board a train, although you doubt if its destination is right. You lose your ticket, and when you have found it, you lose it again. The conductor is an unpleasant fellow. During a snow storm you are compelled to crawl over the roof of the train. And after the arrival of the train in a funny town with lots of small alleys, of course you get lost. It is a tale of doubt, loss, fear of failure, and inevitability. As such it revives the old Christmas message, where a Saviour is born to lead the way. Christmas was meant to be a time of reflection on the purpose of life, and an ethical or religious experience. But somewhere in the nineteenth century the message became blurred. Perhaps it started with Dickens, who changed the choice between good and evil into a choice between consumerism and greed. And after WW2 we just wanted to be happy and even this unpleasant greed was wiped out. What remains is a thick hairy old man with a beard and a red suit, a silly fatty, whose sole purpose in life is to distribute gifts on one evening in the year. It is the present that counts! We got films like 'White Christmas', where Tiny Tim is replaced by a retired general. I welcome every attempt to regain something of the ancient Christmas spirit, with an honest incitement to search your soul and ponder over the road (not) taken. It is the human challenge to attempt to control your dreams. Imho The Polar Express sounds the right chord. I love the remark, that the destination of the train in itself is irrelevant: 'The important thing is to get on the train' - and make something of it. Some times are good, for instance when the hungry kids can avalanche in the train (pun intended). Upon arrival in the town the train forms a beautiful question mark. But the end misses the point, because out of a sea of light emerges the obligatory fat dad in red. He is an impolite (hint: imp), He gives a bell to X, the main character. Of course X is delighted to avenue one. But the poor reindeer toil and moil to move fatty's sleigh. In the air he dives on the crowd like a fighter-bomber. If he is supposed to portray the Holy Father or the Lord, than it is blasphemy. Let us call these scenes irony, and conclude that The Polar Express is recommendable for those who appreciate a travel to the inner self. I contrite a thing, but perhaps you still enjoy this review. Don't forget to check off the 'useful: yes' ballot. I love comments.",8,3,3,20 January 2014
The Grapes of Wrath," A drama about the expulsion of peasants from their tenant farm
","The Grapes of Wrath is an exceptional film, both in substance and as an artistic accomplishment. Since I did not read the book, my review is written without any prejudice. In the film we follow an extended family of small peasants, the Joads, who are expelled from their tenant farm. At first the story may seem a typical part of American history, which is of course true. For instance the illustrious folk singer Woody Guthrie had his roots in the Oklahoma dust bowl, and the eventual migration to California. I was truly fascinated by his biographic DVD 'This machine kills fascists'. But in fact the expulsion of small peasants is a universal theme. Already in the fifteenth century it started with the English enclosure movement. In the nineteenth century it was a recurring phenomenon in all parts of Europe. For instance, in 1903 the Flemish author Cyriel Buysse wrote a play about it ('Het gezin van Paemel'), and created one of the predecessors of Steinbeck's novel. Later a Flemish film version has been produced, which is highly recommendable. And then in the Bolshewist countries there was the forced transformation into collective farming. Although the Czechoslovak and Polish regimes shrunk from this move, which gives food for reflection. The making public of the American version through a book and subsequently a film was a courageous endeavor, since social critique is rarely welcomed (it could probably only be done because of the friendly New Deal atmosphere). Paricularly striking is the scene, where a farmer tries to prevent the demolition of his farm by threatening with a rifle. He asks the usher: 'Against who should I defend myself?' The land owner? No, it is only an enterprise. The director of the enterprise? No, he just does what he is told to do. The bank? No, it simply reacts to the demand of the market. Of course the usher puts up a sham, because each and every one of these institutions is to blame (evidently in the first place the director, who has made a willful decision to break up the long-lasting business relation). The homeless farmers migrate en bloc to California (!), hoping to make a living as pickers. They live in tent camps, and are murdered by villagers, the thugs of land owners, and even the local police (especially the deputies are accomplices of the wealthy land owners). The main character is the peasants son Tom Joad (impressively portrayed by Henry Fonda). He has just served six years in prison for man slaughter, and is freed on parole. Here we see a glimpse of the family pride. When Tom returns home to Oklahoma, his family assumes: 'Did you escape?' Especially grandfather is delighted: 'I told you so! They can't lock up a Joad!' He and many others hold that they have a right to the Oklahoma land, because many of them died there: 'It is our dust'. All peasant communities share this same common isolation, caused by an apparent independence and self-provision (my grandparents were also farmers). This tends to make them inflexible. Grandpa and Grandma die during the ride to California. This does not come as a surprise, and therefore the Stalin-like director of the land owning company does not go free here. Characteristic of the small and collective peasant world is the mother of the family, who complains that she sees her family falling apart. Again Tom kills a man, this time not in self-defense. Frankly, I don't understand this aspect of the narrative. On the one side, Tom is no more a criminal than the policeman, who for no reason fires with his gun in a crowded camp of migrants and seriously wounds an innocent woman. On the other hand, it impedes the feelings of empathy and identification of the viewer/reader, and images the Joads as culpable wrong-doers. As a matter of fact, it can be argued that the Joad family (just like the Paemels) have neglected the change of time,and the agricultural revolution. This is a central point. Too often the changing policy of the society elite is far-reaching to such an extent, that the common people get no fair chance to adapt. And this can truly be called a crime. In conclusion: The Grapes of Wrath is recommended (which it doesn't need). If you like social films, see Het gezin van Paemel. Or consider reading my other reviews.",8,0,0,5 January 2011
Doctor Zhivago," An impressive portrayal of the October Revolution
","It is a Hollywood habit to recommend many of the classic movies under the pretext of the ultimate love story. And invariably this classification proves to be a sham. You can only speculate about the reasons behind this lack of respect for the intellect of the addressed audience. Doctor Zhivago belongs to this category of films. For in truth we see a man (doctor Zhivago) time and again betraying his wife, without having the courage to separate and stay with his mistress. The musical score 'Lara's theme' (Somewhere my love) is an excellent find to reinforce the false romanticism. Neither is Doctor Zhivago an outstanding portrayal of WWI. On this subject there are clearly better creations, for instance the German film 'Westfront 1918' (which reverses the love story of Doctor Zhivago: a soldier is granted leave and finds his wife in bed with another man). Nevertheless, Doctor Zhivago deserves to remain a part of our film history (unfortunately I did not read the book; if I only had time...). For I do not know films that give a better account of the Russian October revolution, and the effects on the living conditions. The decay of society, the uncertainty and misery, the terror, the civil war. Zhivago belongs to the small upper middle class, that was emerging in the feudal Russia at the start of the twentieth century. The Tsar is still the absolute ruler, but his reign is festered with corruption and nepotism. His rule already obtained a staggering blow in 1905, during the turmoil after the lost war against Japan. In WWI the nearing defeat against Germany can only lead to his abdication. Zhivago is a promising poet, and happily married with his youth friend Tania. Lara is married to the revolutionary Pasha, but it is clear that she can never adapt to his lifestyle. Zhivago joins the army as a physician, and empathizes with the fate of the common soldiers. Here he again meets his acquaintance Lara, and a spark jumps over. Zhivago returns to Moscow, where the Bolshevists have seized power, They confiscate the apartments of Zhivago's family. In the mean time a civil war has erupted in Russia, between the Red Army and the White rebels (supported by the western powers, who have a strong disliking for a socialist experiment, I guess mainly because of the nationalizations). The Zhivago family decides to flee Moscow, and take a truly crowded train, which throws them into a primitive life. During a short stop, Zhivago takes a stroll and is seized by the Red Army of Trotski. They need him as a physician, and force him to participate in their battles. These are heart-rending scenes, since the Russian society is rapidly disintegrating, and the Bolshevist alternative is inadequate. Finally Zhivago can bear the brunt no more, and deserts. Fate reunites him with Lara. They flee to the summer residence of the Zhivagos, which in mid-winter looks like an fairy tale ice-palace. Amidst the collapse of society Zhivago and Lara possess the luxury to create their own dream. Here Zhivago reaches his greatest heights as a poet. And then, as a result of the revolutionary activities they are separated again. The harmonious life with his wife Tania has become impossible, and she flees the country. Zhivago remains back as a broken man. Somewhere else Lara bears his daughter, and it is suggested that Lara later becomes a victim of the indiscriminate Stalinist repression. A nice touch is, that the story is embedded into another short story, namely the life of his supposed daughter (many years later, during the Chrutshov era) as a fulfilled factory worker. So in conclusion, the revolutionary times are portrayed as the reign of brute violence, and I am pretty certain that this resembles the truth. It was a wretched experiment, and certainly not a time of hope. It was as unfortunate as Zhivago's affair. For me, this is the message of the film.

The Graduate," This film is perverse
","This film is perverse and the reasons are not what you think they are. The film was made in 1967 and the belief is widespread, that it portrays the atmosphere of the roaring sixties. I must admit that for some time this has been also my superficial impression. Indeed it can not be denied that the sweet music of Simon and Garfunkel is a hallmark of those days. And yes, the film advocates a liberal sexual behavior and clearing of taboos. Nevertheless, after a closer examination I must strongly disagree. It is true that the main character Ben says: 'I wanted to be different'. And he actually succeeds. But his devotion is definitely not directed towards the realization of civil rights, the abandonment of war, or even moral liberation and the mitigation of authority. In fact he and the other main juvenile character Elaine derail in a way, that makes the dysfunctionalities of their parents look insignificant. They develop morals, that are perverse by every reasonable standard. Although the film tries to trick you into believing in a happy end, as sure as eggs is eggs the social misfits Ben and Elaine will continue to wreak havoc. The elaboration on the character of Elaine can be short: she succeeds in convincing two men at the same time, that she will marry them. She actually marries one (the good Carl Smith), and immediately runs off with the other (Ben)! However, the really villainous character is Ben. Although only twenty-one years of age, he gets involved in sexual affairs with two married women. He has the brutality to say to the first (the illustrious mrs. Robinson): 'I enjoy it. I look forward to it. It's the one thing I look forward to' and to the second (Elaine): 'You're the first thing for so long that I like'. The unfolding tragedy gets apparent, when the first woman discloses that her marriage is hopeless, and she herself has since long become an alcoholic. Indeed her attitude is unsound, but she remains within conceivable boundaries. Her distress (aptly played by Anne Bancroft, and the best scenes in the film) does not stop Ben from eventually dropping her like a hot potato, without any signs of remorse. A long-lasting affair becomes less than a one-night stand. He even explains to her husband, that the affair was comparable to a handshake. In a fit of brilliance mr. Robinson replies 'You pardon me if I don't shake hands with you'. He makes the only sane remark in the film, when he accuses Ben of having a filthy mind. However the film-makers take sides by presenting mr. Robinson as a stumbling idiot. Ben's apparent childish drivel (played in an outstanding way by Dustin Hoffman) degenerates into a diabolic manipulation. The dialogs are rude, pieces of bad taste, and one might say violent. They make 'Deep throat' look bleak. For instance, Ben knows that in their youth the parents of Elaine had sexual intercourse in their car ('My God! In a Ford?'). One day Elaine tells him, that Carl Smith has proposed marriage: 'He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team'. Ben replies: 'Where did he do it? It wasn't in his car, was it?'. And I repeat: when he and Elaine elope, their relation is obviously doomed from the start. Still it could have been a quality film, if the makers had contented themselves with a reality approach. Instead they tried to deform the events into the shape of a romantic love affair. If this was an attempt to be cynical, then in my opinion it has failed dramatically, since even cynicism has its limits. In spite of excellent play by the actors, what remains is a perverse message, lacking any reasonable moral. It is an overt plea for impulsive and instrumental relationships, preying upon human weakness. My advice: spare yourself the disgust of this degenerate produce.",4,1,5,31 August 2010
All Quiet on the Western Front," The horrors in the trenches of WWI
","Each film has its own audience. Until today the war film 'Saving private Ryan' managed to attract more than 2000 reviews. I guess that the film 'All quiet on the Western front' draws a somewhat more advanced public. On careful consideration, it is the First World War that appeals most to the imagination when reflecting upon the horrors of war. After WWI war has never again been the same. With 'Im Westen nichts Neues' Remarque wrote an outstanding account of the misery in the trenches. This is the first try of a cinematic translation, and than there was a remake, in 'The Hallmark Hall of Fame'. Most reviews appreciate the 1930 version, but to me it seems that the remake more closely follows the narrative and the atmosphere of the book. I also found some comments lamenting that it is an English-spoken produce, and so the typical German expressiveness is lost. There is some truth in this critique, and in fact there is a really German counterpart. This is the film 'Westfront 1918', which was also made in the early thirties and based on a novel (titled 'Vier von der Infantry'). If you appreciated 'All quiet on the western front', then 'Westfront 1918' is definitely a film for you. The main difference between both films is that the German version has an almost documentary style. Both films have a similar main character (resp. Paul Brenner and Karl), but in 'Westfront 1918' the story line is even thinner. The central theme is war, trenches, barbed wire, death, destruction, and decay. I guess the documentary style of 'Westfront 1918' was inevitable, since the makers had been in the middle of the conflict and had experienced the horrors by themselves (even on the 'homefront'). Whereas the American makers of 'All quiet on the western front' maintain some distance and try to give an interpretation from a personal point of view, the makers of 'Westfront 1918' can only recount what happened. There is no room for empathy with anything. This makes in my opinion the latter film more impressive and horrific. Therefore I will probably not like 'Saving private Ryan', since it tries to transform the collective nature of war into an individual affair. Anyway, 'All quiet on the western front' goes like this. In 1914 Paul Baumer volunteers together with 20 of his classmates. At the front in France they soon discover the gruesome reality. They are confronted with the terrible routine in the trenches. A highly emotional aspect is the proximity of the conflict, since apart from the perpetuating anonymous shelling it is still largely a man-to-man fight with drawn bayonets and experimental flame-throwers. You can yet by accident find yourself in a bomb crater, together with an armed enemy volunteer. It also helps to place the film into the context of military history. In the second half of the nineteenth century the wars were often short encounters between professional armies, which hardly affected the population. However, by the end of the century the rise of imperialism had caused an arms race (something like the Cold War), which stupefied the common people. The mass destruction reached proportions, that surpassed the contemporary human imagination. Man lost what had remained of his innocence. It was this war, that ended the remaining absolute monarchies and even caused the birth of an entirely new society system in Russia. It created the first insane forms of art (Dada), and strongly furthered the foundation of pacifism and the League of Nations.",8,2,2,27 December 2010
There Will Be Blood," Based on the book??
","In fact, my interest in the film 'There will be blood' was aroused because they announce (fellow-foreigners, this is one-sixteenth of a pound), that it is based on the book Oil by Upton Sinclair. And I should add in the same breath, that this claim is misleading. In this review I want to compare the film and its professed source of inspiration, the book. The film tells the story of an oilman, who is smart enough to succeed in business, but who also suffers from a uncontrollable rage. He is adamant (the very first insect). He murders a subordinate, and disposes of the body. At the end of the film, he also murders a priest. Requital is near, for hell is torrid. Unfortunately, I don't see the point. The story does not contain any mental challenges. To be fair, the film deserves credit with inciting me to read Oil, in a Dutch translation from 1937. Joke to make this text more palatable: a man visits his psychiatrist. He complains: 'Each night I dream about English films. But what really irritates me are those Dutch subtitles'. The book of Sinclair does better than the film. In the book the oilman is a straightforward business man, who loves his work. The main purpose of the narrative is to show the adverse influence of capitalism on society. For it separates the people into two camps, the haves and the have-nots. The mutual relations polarize (=what penguins see with). The oilman and other rich people bribe the state, so that it will serve their interests. And the workers receive a miserable wage. This creates hostility, and brings the oilman into conflict with the emerging trade unions. Sinclair tries to show that everybody suffers from this system. The poor live in destitute conditions, and above all lack leisure time. The rich lead meaningless lives, while trying to impress each other with their luxury. Joke: a millionaire summons his servant: 'James, drive the fish under the bridge. It starts to rain'. Sinclair also describes how the social-democrats and the Leninists try to oppose the system. I don't know if Sinclair supported the socialist ideology, but I find his narrative fairly objective. In fact Sinclair portrays the oilman in such a way, that I like him. His character is not bad by nature. It is the system, that forces him to use harsh and even illegal methods. I believe that this message is worth reflecting upon, for it contains an element of truth. American never liked socialism, and they were right. But still capitalism needs to be reformed. Riddle: do you know a book with a sad ending? My deposit book. Perhaps now you understand why I dislike the film makers, who fooled me into buying their DVD. If there are merits in the film that justify its recommendation, I don't see them. Don't hesitate to leave a comment. I love it.",6,0,1,8 September 2015
The Truman Show," A warning against spying and oppression?
","I used the last days of December to watch some films, that had impressed me about a decade ago. The film The Truman Show was among them. Around 2000 I watched The Truman Show several times, and tried to analyze its contents. Like many modern movies, it contains an ambiguous message. Obviously the leading theme is the obtrusive invasion of our private life by the producers of television programs. The common life of individual people is transformed into entertainment, not just in the form of a single commentary, but by means of regular (weekly or even daily) broadcastings. At the time this type of entertainment was still a novelty. I even remember that shortly after The Truman Show a similar film about the topic was released, titled EdTV. Since 2000 the so-called reality TV has become a common vehicle of entertainment, probably because it is cheap and doesn't require any careful considerations. Nevertheless The Truman Show has withstood the ravages of time, and still succeeds in fascinating me. At the time, I interpreted the story as a critique on the unwanted invasion of your private living space by unknown outsiders. For passer-bys clearly and intentionally block Burbanks passage, when he is in a hurry, both in a hospital, on the sidewalk, or in the file on the highway. During a chance meeting a cop unexpectedly happens to know his name. When Burbank wishes to visit the Fijis, the posters in the local traveling agency try to instil a fear for flying, and the flights to the Fijis happen to be fully booked for at least a month. Burbank discovers that in an eternal procession the same group of strangers circulates around his house. As a whole the chance of an accidental conjunction of circumstances becomes negligible, and Burbank logically concludes that it is all premeditated. The only surprise is his slowness in the uptake, considering that he had already been encysted for thirty years, since his birth. In the end Burbank succeeds in escaping from his artificial, repressing and hostile world. But now, after another ten years, I doubt that this is really the leading theme. For we live in a world, where you can simply watch the home life of your neighbors by infiltrating their computer through the net and controlling their web-cam by means of spy-ware. And if you can not do this, your government or an ICT firm certainly can. Apparently The Truman Show is not so much a protest against a threatening future Big Brother society (after the narration of the totalitarian society by George Orwell), as a warning against the actual way of living, that develops around us. Thus the story becomes a hotchpotch of undesirable developments: for instance the intrusion of advertising in our lives. Or the social encysting and gossiping in the small community. Perhaps even the oppression by social conventions in general. Or the spying by the state and enterprises on their citizens and costumers, which in the professed age of terrorism has become unbounded. Apparently the narrative of The Truman Show is more a shower of grains of shot than a well-targeted critique. So although I still appreciate the film and its invitation to ponder, it is clearly not the monument of resistance that I presumed twelve years ago. A pity. Disappointing.",8,1,2,3 January 2012
