The Blair Witch Project," This is no Movie, This is Art
","This is really the most scary movie I've ever seen. It's so realistic! The whole film is only shot with the two camera's the film makers carried. During the whole movie you get never frightened, but you have to live with this great primary (life-)fear. That makes the force of this movie. It's filled with empty spot (actually the whole movie is an empty spot). Great Film-making guys!",9,1,2,6 August 2000
