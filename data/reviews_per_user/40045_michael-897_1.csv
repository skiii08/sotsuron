Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Sacha Baron Cohen is hilarious!
","Yeashamiz! Sacha Baron Cohen is probably one of the funniest comedians ever. All three of his characters on the Ali G Show are amazing. I would recommend renting, then buying both seasons of the Ali G Show. (Any chance of a third season? What do you say HBO? I'm sure there are a few interviews left) If this movie is patterned after the show it can't miss! The trailer seems near perfect. Found a few conflicting opening dates for the film; can anyone confirm opening date for Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan. Sacha, change nothing. Can't wait to see your film Big up yourself.Mike",10,7,32,5 September 2006
