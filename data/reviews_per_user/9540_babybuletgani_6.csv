Ford v Ferrari," If you're unfamiliar with the titular race, you won't slip behind
","If you're unfamiliar with the titular race, you won't slip behind. Le Mans '66 requires no prior interest in the sport in the same way that you don't need to be a boxing fanatic to enjoy Rocky. At heart, it's a character piece; a platonic romance between two men best able to express themselves behind the wheel. Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon, affable as ever) is a former racerturned-car designer. In the '60s he's hired by Ford to head up the ailing motor company's morale-boosting effort to win the famous 24 Hours Of Le Mans endurance race. And, more specifically, to beat the reigning Ferrari team while doing so.
Shelby brings in his buddy Ken Miles (Christian Bale) not only to help design the vehicle that Ford is betting the farm on, but also to drive it. The aptly named Miles is purely driven by his passion for the automotive arts and an unquenchable need for speed. Wayward Brummie accent aside, it's a lovely, warm performance from Bale. There's the trademark intensity - heightened by his geometrically sharp cheekbones - but here it's in service to a common goal, and a love of the sport. Miles doesn't suffer fools, but there's a sweetness to his family-man side and the sheer thrill he gets from racing, hooting things like 'Giddy-up!' as he pushes the rev counter to its limit. If Miles is the heart of the team, Shelby's the head, bringing his own racing expertise to bear while also managing the expectations of the suits upstairs, including the irascible Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) and smarmy marketing type Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas). (There's a barely hidden filmmaking analogy here, as the creative visionaries struggle to keep their ideas on track while placating the needs of the executives.) Throw in Jon Bernthal as another, more amenable, exec and the cast starts to feel a little bloated, especially given that the two-hours-30 runtime is generous for a film on a largely predictable track. Bernthal's good, but did we really need another middle-man in the mix, given that Shelby already occupies that negotiator role?
Le Mans '66 truly roars into life during the racing scenes, particularly the final act show-stopper. The visceral, pulsequickening laps instantly join the canon of great race sequences, and they're a testament to the skill of director James Mangold and his team, equalling the set-pieces in any more obviously 'bankable' blockbusters. But Mangold's film isn't quite as compelling when not behind the wheel of a record-breaking sports car. For one thing, the US title Ford V Ferrari is somewhat misleading - yes, Ford are looking to unseat the Italian giants, but the latter are so little seen that there's never a palpable sense of a head-to-head rivalry. In their minimal screentime, the Italians come across as scowling stereotypes. And on the subject of stereotypes, Outlander's Caitriona Balfe is lumbered with a limited supportive-wife role as Mollie Miles. It's clear she knows her way around an engine, but she's rarely required to do more that squint with concern at a radio while her husband races. The family scenes don't quite get under the skin of Miles' compulsions in the way that First Man explored the more selfish aspects of Neil Armstrong's pursuits. It's on the physical side that Le Mans '66 really delivers - not only in the aforementioned races, but in the lo-fi mechanics, and the pit stops that canon of great race sequences, and they're a testament to the skill of director James Mangold and his team, equalling the set-pieces in any more obviously 'bankable' blockbusters. But Mangold's film isn't quite as compelling when not behind the wheel of a record-breaking sports car. For one thing, the US title Ford V Ferrari is somewhat misleading - yes, Ford are looking to unseat the Italian giants, but the latter are so little seen take an eternity in comparison to modern-day refuelling methods. The film is a visual treat, an expertly crafted piece of sun-burnished Americana, with no shortage of big-screen thrills. Mangold's career to date has seen a mix of straightforward blockbusters (Knight And Day, The Wolverine) and character pieces (Girl, Interrupted, Cop Land, Walk The Line) but, for all its strengths, Le Mans '66 doesn't straddle that divide as effectively as Mangold's last film, Logan, did.",6,24,60,16 November 2019
In Bruges," Rivalling Withnail & I for quotability ('Two manky hookers and a racist dwarf. I'm headin' home')
","Rivalling Withnail & I for quotability ('Two manky hookers and a racist dwarf. I'm headin' home'), writer-director Martin McDonagh's endlessly entertaining and unexpectedly affecting debut feature about a pair of hitmen lying low in Bruges makes a welcome return to Blu-ray. While any image upgrades to the film itself are subtle, it's the improved bonus material - including an appealing HD presentation of McDonagh's deliciously dark and funny short Six Shooter, which won an Oscar in 2006 - that make this such a worthwhile double-dip.",10,0,1,13 November 2019
Rocketman," Sex, drugs, rock, roll, uncaring parents, callous lovers
","Sex, drugs, rock, roll, uncaring parents, callous lovers... for all the potency of the material, this Elton John portrait never quite scales the heights of Taron Egerton/ Dexter Fletcher's previous bespectacled biopic, Eddie The Eagle. Nonetheless, it's easy on the ear and blistering on the eye, whether it's the outre outfits (which naturally bag their own featurette) or the multiple musical set-pieces, flights (or, if you will, floats) of fancy that don't go breaking the narrative flow. With its select-song and sing-along options, the Blu-ray's ready-made for karaoke.",6,2,3,8 November 2019
Hotel Mumbai," REAL-WORLD ATROCITIES TOOLED FOR SENSORY IMPACT
","Despite its fierce punch, Hotel Mumbai - pulled from release in New Zealand following the Christchurch shootings - hits shaky ground as it couples real-world terrors with disaster movie conventions. Maras keeps the focus sharp initially, ranging with controlled fluency from instructions heard on Islamist militants' headphones to the meeting of disparate characters at the hotel. Employees include Dev Patel's steady waiter Arjun and his boss Oberoi (standout Anupam Kher); guests include spouses Nazanin Boniada and Armie Hammer, with baby and nanny (Tilda Cobham-Hervey).
When the attacks begin, the staging is nerve-shattering. DoP Nick Remy Matthews' tight-knuckle framing turns hotel corridors into sites of claustrophobic terror; meanwhile, the nanny's struggle to quieten the baby in hiding generates horror-grade chills. Yet this show of genre proficiency starts to seem over-calculated. Comedic asides are utilised for tension-andrelease effect, awkwardly. Geopolitical contexts receive less attention than Jason Isaacs' wobbly Russian accent, while white characters' deaths draw more attention than non-white ones.
Even if Oberoi's 'the guest is God' mantra nods to class themes, Maras seems more intent on serving perceived audience appetites for dramatic immersion than exploring them. As the in-the-moment impact increases, so does the queasy aftertaste.",8,1,11,21 October 2019
Joker," Radically different from contemporary comic-book cinema structurally
","Radically different from contemporary comic-book cinema structurally, tonally and morally, Joker has more in common with Taxi Driver and The King Of Comedy than it does with Avengers Assemble or The Dark Knight. On multiple levels, it's the most challenging, subversive and nihilistic comic-book movie ever made. Needless to say, pint-sized Bat-fans should steer clear. We're first introduced to Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) applying make-up in preparation for his day job as a clown-for-hire, his face contorted into a horrific half-smile, half-cry grimace - the result of a neurological condition that causes involuntary, pathological laughter. Arthur's therapist is providing little relief, and that's before the practice is shuttered. Living in a shabby apartment block with his infirm mum, and getting nowhere as a stand-up comedian, Arthur is habitually treated with contempt or outright hostility. But his life only truly starts to spiral after a violent encounter on a subway car kickstarts a terrifying transformation.
Mirroring Arthur's descent is Gotham's own decay. It's 1981. Rubbish is piling up, 'super rats' are having their fill and Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) is running for mayor. Far from the altruistic entrepreneur of Bat-dads past, Cullen's Wayne is a loathsome one-per-center who unapologetically declares Gotham's citizens 'clowns' on TV. At a time when the obscene economic divide between rich and poor grows greater by the second, Joker has its finger on the political and social pulse in daring ways. Simply put, Gotham is a powder keg and the Joker is perfectly placed to light the fuse. It should come as little surprise that Phoenix is staggeringly good here. That he's found a fresh take on a character as well worn as the Joker is one thing - that it feels just as definitive as Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger's indelible interpretations is another altogether. Physically and psychologically, it's a horrifyingly funny performance. Losing 52lb for the part, Phoenix twists his skeletal frame into unsettling configurations, while he runs in a broadly comic way that looks like he has oversized shoes stuck to his soles at all times. Rather than the gleefully sadistic criminal mastermind of the comics - this is an origin story, after all - Arthur's defining characteristic is that he's ill. Phoenix engenders such powerful empathy for Fleck that some of the horrifying setbacks he faces, including a mental-health care system that profoundly fails him, are genuinely upsetting. By the film's charged, devilishly brilliant final act, you feel Fleck's rage at the injustice of a bankrupt world so overwhelmingly that, while his actions can't be justified, they can be clearly understood.
That Joker was directed and co-written by Todd Phillips - best known for the Hangover trilogy - makes this all the more remarkable. Unexpectedly, Phillips and the Ace of Knaves have turned out to be the perfect marriage of filmmaker and material; practically every choice is on the money. The early '80s aesthetic is so convincing it almost feels like a film made by a Scorsese contemporary. And the precision deployment of numerous rug-pulling revelations only works because Phillips and co-writer Scott Silver are storytellers willing to kill DC's golden geese. If there's a shortcoming, it's that Joker exists squarely in Scorsese's shadow, but it gets away with brazen thievery by openly acknowledging this. In a knowing inversion of his role in The King Of Comedy, Robert De Niro plays a beloved late-night host on whose talk show Arthur dreams of appearing. Several supporting roles are also a little thin - Zazie Beetz as a neighbour who takes a shine to Arthur being the clearest example. But this is the Joker show from first final act, you feel Fleck's rage at the injustice of a bankrupt world so overwhelmingly that, while his actions can't be justified, they can be clearly understood. LONE STRANGER That Joker was directed and co-written by Todd Phillips - best known for the Hangover trilogy - makes this all the more remarkable. Unexpectedly, Phillips and the Ace of Knaves have turned out to be the perfect marriage of filmmaker and material; practically to last frame, and Phoenix brings the house down. Sure, he's not performing magic tricks with pencils, or bringing Gotham to its knees with laughing gas, but this Joker is every bit as valid and fascinating as the ones before him, and works better for not being chained to a larger universe. If the result of the DCEU's failure to hit on a successful, consistent tone in its films is radical standalones of this quality, it may be the once-struggling studio's smartest move.",10,0,3,22 October 2019
It Chapter Two," Opening back in 1989
","Opening back in 1989, as the Losers' Club enter a blood pact to again fight the shape-shifting evil of 'It' should Derry's streets and storm drains ever run red again, the action then jumps forward 27 years to the brutal death of Adrian Mellon (Xavier Dolan). Beaten in a homophobic attack, Adrian is thrown off a bridge into the churning river, only for a clown to appear on the bank and offer an outstretched hand...
Mike (Isaiah Mustafa), the only Loser who has remained in Derry, puts out calls to Bill (James McAvoy), Beverly (Jessica Chastain), Richie (Bill Hader), Eddie (James Ransone), Ben (Jay Ryan) and Stanley (Andy Bean). They are scattered, memories tattered, but Pennywise the Dancing Clown (Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd) is ready to greet them all. And he - it - remembers everything. Clocking in at nearly three hours (insert 'ballooning running time' gag here), It Chapter Two sees returning director Andy Muschietti craft a hugely ambitious horror blockbuster the like of which we've not seen since Kubrick's The Shining. Too long? Nah, its flaws lie elsewhere: the book's WTF ending works better on page than screen; Pennywise loses some of his scarefactor as his mythology is laid bare; the mid-section is episodic - a series of horror shorts laid end-to-end - as Pennywise terrorises each of the adult Losers in turn; and too many reality-bleeding-into-fantasy scenes featuring too much CGI make It Chapter Two resemble a latter-day Freddy Krueger movie. (A Nightmare On Elm Street 5 even plays at the pictures in one of the 1989 flashbacks.)
Still, huge kudos goes to Muschietti for once again capturing the essence of King's magnum opus. There are many glorious scenes here and a real frisson comes from seeing the adult Losers (all good, with Hader the standout) return to the Barrens, Keenes Pharmacy and, of course, the house of Neibolt Street. Themes of memory, identity and trauma run deep, and viewers can expect shivers aplenty; dread is just a part of it. The biggest shudders are of delight as It Chapter Two flip-flops between timeframes to chase the poignancy and sweet melancholy that King writes so well.",6,0,0,8 November 2019
