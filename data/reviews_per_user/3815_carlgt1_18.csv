Vertigo," A great movie with just a flaw (IMHO) in the love story.
","This is a great movie and an excellent example of the masterful Hitchcock touch.  Some of the cut scenes, the photography are really landmarks in film.  My favorite is when Scottie is in the hotel room with the girl embracing, the camera moves around them; the livery stable scene is in the background, then we're back to the hotel room.  I'm not so sure it's worthy of being #29 at IMDB.  But it is pretty darn good how the writers & Hitchcock were able to blend the supernatural element (through the story line as well as the cinematography) with the logical explanation at the end (sort of an uber-Scooby Doo episode ;-).I give it a 9 out of 10, just losing a point because I wasn't convinced by what seemed to be the rushed love interest with Scottie & Madeleine at first.  Would such a stand-up guy like Scottie be making out with his old college pal's wife after what seemed like two days of tailing here?  And it seemed a bit rushed or forced in the followup pursuit of Judy.  I suppose this rushed love interest was a necessary evil as the film would be 4 hours long if it developed normally?  And poor Midge seemed to be a pretty useless character.  But these are minor gripes overshadowed by the otherwise great story, photography, & direction by Hitchcock.",9,2,4,26 February 2001
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Pretty good though not the best Python
","This is a pretty good film although my least favorite of the Monty Python films (in ascending order I like Meaning of Life & Holy Grail better). Chapman does a great portrayal of the mistaken messiah Brian, and the rest of the cast does a great job of ridiculing the messiah crazy ancient times, but it just seems to drag for some reason.  It's a good showcase for the comic skills of the Python troupe as they each portray a few characters. Besides the irreverence which angered the church & sanctimonious people back in the day, the film does bring up some interesting points of hero-worship. And the idea that people want to believe in SOMETHING that carries down through to modern times.",8,1,4,4 November 2000
The Great Dictator," Funny & frightening.
","It's tough discovering Charlie Chaplin films like 'The Great Dictator' and even 'Modern Times.'  They put you through such a range of emotions from comedy through tragedy in one show that you feel schizophrenic.  I guess that's more power to the artistry of Chaplin.  'The Great Dictator' is obvious in it's sadness since it was done in 1940, and the movie finishes with such hope but looking back from our 'modern times' we all know that there were five more miserable years of Nazi facism, concentration camps, and misery.This is obviously a great propaganda piece, but there's much more to it than something like Olivier's jingoistic 'Henry V' (another excellent film of the period).  What I find refershing is how perceptive Chaplin is in his speech at the end to unite all religions and races etc.  Sadly enough it sounds dated to our 'modern' ears, sort of like John Lennon's 'All You Need Is Love' must sound in this era of right-wing talk-radio pundits pushing 'compassionate conservatism.'  PS -- There's so much in this film that's eternal it's awkward reading some of the misinformation in the reviews, and people whining about the costumes or whatever.  For instance, in the review from Aug 12, 2000 that they are using as the only review on the front page of IMDB.  It wasn't the Hynkel/Dictator who was 'endearing' in the gun & upside-down aeroplanes.  I thought it was obvious that was the barber, who after his antics as a soldier crashed with Schultz and had amnesia.",10,2,4,23 February 2001
X-Men," Good fun 8 of 10
",It's a pretty good fun movie especially if you're into that sci-fi comic book stuff.  It gets a little 'hokey' in spots but nowhere near as far as something like 'Starship Troopers' (which may just be trying to be 'campy' on purpose).  The acting from Ian McKellen & Patrick Stewart is very good; the rest are OK.  Special effects & audio (on the DVD at least) make this a good rental or buy to test out your system.,8,0,0,8 April 2001
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Fun movie, not really an epic Western
","I thought this was a fun movie (a solid 8 of 10) but I didn't get the feeling that it was a grand epic Western as some people say.  The Burt Bacharach music was nice but a little bit corny in the context of this movie.  The interlude with the old-style, sepia-toned photographs of their adventures in New York (while waiting for the ship to Bolivia) was well done.  Redford & Newman did a great job with their characters but I didn't really care for anybody else in the movie and it was pretty much just their show.",8,1,2,28 February 2001
Duck Soup," Funny though generations away
","I have finally seen this film (actually bought the DVD for $9 at the mall), and while I was raised on Monty Python & newer movies, I can honestly say that 'Duck Soup' is as good as everyone says.  You can't go into thinking as if you're going to see an Eddie Murphy movie or a modern (nastier?) movie. This movie was made in far different times from what we live in today; a divide that's wider than the almost 70 years that separates it from us.  I believe there is even a racial joke or two about 'darkies' to further date it.  But other than that, Groucho is still the master of the one-liner & put-down and slapstick humor has never gone wrong since the first caveman slipped on a banana peel.On another level, the film shows an evily sarcastic look at the politics of war (e.g. insults leading to war and mass destruction).  From the similar era, the Gershwin's & George Kaufman gave us the musicals such as 'Of Thee I Sing' and 'Let 'Em Eat Cake' which also showed us the absurdity of war & politics (albeit at a more cerebral level than the Marx Bros.).  But in this day and age of presidential 'scandals' and trumped up election results it's refreshing to take a pause and think that 70 years ago people seemed just as willing to doubt their politicians and even war (especially since this film & the Gershwin musicals falling between two so-called 'just' wars -- so that even Ira Gershwin had to rewrite 'Strike Up The Band' to have less offensive lyrics for WW2).Also, as a modern note, 'Duck Soup' played a part in a great practical joke on latter-day politicians via 'Spy' magazine.  They called up various politicians in DC and asked them 'What are you going to do about the ethnic-cleansing in Freedonia?'  As you can expect, they fell all over themselves saying either 'we should work hard to stop it, send troops' or 'we should not get involved' etc.  Nobody asked 'Where is Freedonia?' which of course exists only in 'Duck Soup!'",9,0,0,17 December 2000
The Last Emperor," Bertolucci's grand epic
","The thing that surprises me the most about this great film is that it's not even in IMDB's top 200 and the fact that so many close-minded people here can't appreciate it.  It's also funny seeing people 'second guess' Pu Yi as if a titular Chinese or Manchurian emperor (no pun intended) had some superhero powers to battle the superpowers.  I think IMDB viewers and backseat monarchs have been watching too many unrealistic action movies. When dreck like Bill Murray films ('Groundhog Day'?) are ranked in the top 250 yet 'The Last Emperor' isn't then there's something really wrong with people.  Then again, they voted for George 'Shrub' Bush I guess...",10,4,6,28 February 2001
2001: A Space Odyssey," One of the classics if not THE best sci-fi movie.
",So much has been written about this movie that all I can say is: team up writer Arthur C. Clarke with director Stanley Kubrick and you get a cinematic masterpiece that will last long after we're gone.  This is still the landmark film that all other serious 'sci-fi' films will have to be evaluated against.,10,1,3,4 November 2000
The Hurricane," A powerful film & a great portrayal by Denzel
","I just wanted to say to some of the people whining about making 'Hurricane' Carter a hero -- critique the movie & Denzel and stop trying to spin your politics & theories of Carter's case into the movie.  As far as the film goes, it was a very powerful look at the struggle that Carter went through to get his case heard.  His portrayal by Denzel Washington was excellently done in showing all sides of this complicated man.",9,0,3,19 December 2000
Some Like It Hot," A fun movie, but perhaps overrated?
","It's a funny movie but I'm a little amazed that it appears as the #1 comedy movie of all time with the AFI, and even at IMDB it's #50 (ahead of Chaplin & Marx Bros classics among others).  Yet compare the size of the 'memorable quotes' page from 'Duck Soup' to 'Some Like It Hot.'  The characters & love interests were all a bit shallow, and it wasn't a revolutionary film or anything like Chaplin & Marx Bros.  So I don't really understand what makes it a top-rated movie.  Is it a revolutionary film just because it had guys in drag in 1950's 'square' America?On the other hand, to answer another critic here, it's silly to compare a screen legend like Marylin Monroe to a 90's plastic-surgery legend and non-actress like Pamela Lee Anderson etc.  They had actresses back then, not aerobicized bimbos who's best performances were with Tommy Lee on Internet-downloaded movie clips.   'Some Like It Hot' is better than most dreck put out nowadays but I can't really see giving it higher than an 8 of 10, 3 of 4 stars, B grade, etc.",8,5,10,25 February 2001
A Hard Day's Night," Should be a top 200 film
","Well admittedly I'm a Beatle fan but I think this is an important enough film that should at least be in the 'top 200' on IMDB.  Especially since Gladiator is, what, #60?  Richard Lester is a great director, the Liverpudlian script by Alun Owen is very suitable for the boys and seems like ad-libs.  Also the black & white film format is perfect although supposedly it was done for monetary and not artistic reasons.  If there's any flaw perhaps it drags a bit at the 'concert' scene at the end (see if you can spot a child Phil Collins in the audience).This was the first teenage exploitation film to be far more than just a vehicle for some hit songs; although there are plenty of hits to go around. By today's 'N'Sync' and 'Brittany Spears' standards The Beatles in this movie are practically avant-garde with a little help from Lester & Owen. 
This is the best Beatle film; in 'Help' they are basically just stoned on pot the whole time with a terrible plot & characters, and 'Yellow Submarine' they hardly had any input other than some leftover songs.  And the less said about the 'Get Back/Let It Be' project and 'Magical Mystery Tour' the better.",10,5,7,28 December 2000
The Green Mile," Another great movie adaptation
","I've always sort of shrugged off Stephen King as a horror writer, and since I'm not into that genre I don't often read his stuff.  And the movies such as 'Children of the Corn,' an adaptation of his short story was so bad it wasn't much of an encouragement.  But with movies like 'The Green Mile' and 'The Shawshank Redemption' one has to give credit for coming up with very good stories that adapt well to the screen.  The acting in this movie is first rate.  And although there isn't an overt 'message' about the death penalty a la 'Dead Man Walking,' the story and depiction of the process is so good that it makes one really question the necessity of the state to consciously and legally kill.  This movie deserves to be on the top 100 list.",10,0,1,30 October 2000
Stalag 17," OK entertainment, not sure of the 'classic' status
","I really wanted to appreciate this film as a classic but it came off a bit goofy in my opinion.  I give it an 8 out of 10; good solid entertainment but not in the legendary, classic status you would think from it's IMDB rank of being the top #153 of all time.I could overlook the obvious jingoism and 'Germans bad, Americans good' since it's a product of its times, McCarthyism, and the Cold War.  But overall, as a war movie, I thought it was an insult to people in real prison camps!  I guess it's hard to take something too seriously which turned into 'Hogan's Heroes.'  Don't get me wrong, there are funny bits and the 'whodunit' story interwoven with the comic stuff is pretty good.  I especially liked the proud capitalist wanna-be-rich-guy meeting up with the proud capitalist already-rich-guy (enemies at first, partners at the end). Basically this movie is a propaganda piece, although by the time it was made the war was long over, and the only war was 'cold' with the Russians.  So it was a little odd that the Russians were OK in the film but the Germans were still 'dumb but not stupid' (Einstein, Bohr, et al would be glad to know that ;-).But the idea that Russian woman prisoners had nothing to do but giggle for strapping American lads to try and ogle them, or 'give a piece' for some silk stockings was a bit tough.  And the obvious buffoonery of the German soldiers was a bit silly although you can see the segue into the 'Hogan's Heroes' TV show.  I guess the only next step would be the 'Hoffman's Heroes' parody that Mad Magazine did years ago (concentration camp humor).So enjoy it for what it is, but I don't quite see how this is such a classic in the war film canon.  I prefer 'Duck Soup' by the Marx Brothers for comedy and a statement of the inanities of war.",8,3,6,1 March 2001
The Deer Hunter," Good Movie, But Perhaps Overrated?
","I took a long time to rent this movie; and I had always heard it was a classic.  The first I knew about it was the beautiful music, theme by Stanley Myers (I had the guitar sheet music).  So I was expecting a classic film. Well it is a good film but I thought there were a lot of holes in it.  The 'Russian roulette' theme gets pretty old (from POW jungle horror to Saigon gambling room) and unbelievable.  Stephen breaks his leg falling from a helicopter; and when you see him back in the USA he's a double amputee refusing to leave the VA hospital?  Nick becomes a brainwashed Russian roulette player/gambler exactly how?  And he inexplicably survives this dangerous career for years until Michael finally gets there as the US is leaving Saigon in '75?  Considering the pains the director took to show us the background of this Russian-American steeltown PA community I kind of thought it was odd to leave out so much.  And the relationship between Meryl Streep/DeNiro/Walken was so facile that the love triangle in 'Pearl Harbor' seemed more plausible.I don't mean to be too critical, it was good entertainment (I give it 8 of 10).  But there are better films about Vietnam, such as Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket.'",Null,4,8,17 January 2002
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Amazing how this low-budget film still holds up!
","I just rewatched this movie and I can't believe how well it stands up to today's big budget, special effects laden galas.  I guess it just goes to show that good writers & actor/comedians make up for a low budget.  Of course director Terry Gilliam went on to bigger budget and special effects laden galas.  But this first effort is still quite remarkable both in the zany & irreverent storyline as well as the hilarious performances from the Monty Python crew.  Even with the surprise ending (according to Gilliam the money had run out so they had little choice but a quick finish) the comedy still holds up well and will hopefully continue down the years.",10,0,0,4 November 2000
Gangs of New York," People Are Panning This, But Gushing Over Lord of the Rings?
","Now wait a minute, I love Tolkien and think the LOTR are great, but I'm shocked that 'Two Towers' is now ranked #10 on IMDB with a 9.0 rating and Gangs of New York is way down off the list at a (currently) 7.8 rating.  I thought Scorcese did an excellent job and although I am no fan of Leo, he wasn't all that bad.  Of course Daniel Day Lewis was great and the supporting actors were excellent.It was nice for once to see a historical movie of epic proportions that wasn't just a jingoistic postcard and showed America in all the nasty xenophobic and blood & guts glory.  And it allows you to draw parallels with current events and our own little xenophobia and political crimes of today, which is what good history should do no matter what Henry Ford said. Perhaps there was a bit too much gratuitous violence but then again can you really sugar-coat a Civil War battle or a lynch mob or just the mob in general?  Everybody was a villain in the film, just as often in real life there are no real heros to look up to.  Leo's character 'Amsterdam' was every bit as bloodthirsty as Lewis' Bill Cutting; if not worse since at least Bill fights in hand-to-hand combat while Leo prefers to sneak up through the ranks and presumably pull an 'inside job.'It's just too bad that so many people just looking for the latest 'shock & grab' miss some of the bigger themes of the movie; yet they presumably find all sorts of 'meaningful' things in 'Eight Mile' and LOTR.",9,0,0,29 December 2002
Braveheart," A good movie, I think it's overrated.
","Braveheart is a very good movie but I don't think it deserves to be in the 'top 100.'  Historically it's terrible, something Mel continued in 'The Patriot.'  It makes for OK entertainment but anybody getting nationalistic inspiration from this movie should get their head examined.  The English kings are portrayed too ridiculously one-dimensional (total evil) and I'm sure things were a lot more complicated; and the love story/affair is just too absurd.  This is probably the most inaccurate story of Britain since William Shakespeare penned 'Richard III.'  But of course this film is far from being anything the Bard would have done.",8,1,2,5 November 2000
Gladiator," Great entertainment, a bit overrated
","Don't get me wrong, this is a very enjoyable flick but as I write this it's ranked #76 of all time at IMDB?  That's a bit overrated.  I would put it as a very good movie of 2000 but that's about it.  It's more like an old Cecil B. Demille film (e.g. 'Ten Commandments') in that it's great entertainment with a huge budget & sets.  Or for a more modern analogy, it's more along the lines of the grandiose pomposity of the 'Titanic' movie or 'The Patriot.'  But it's far from being an important or classic movie in the canon (although admittedly in my opinion there are other duds in the 'Top 250' IMDB list, such as 'Braveheart' @ #66).",8,0,0,27 December 2000
