Requiem for a Dream," Main theme sound is superb...
","My opinion is that the soundtrack of this movie is one of the best ever made, i also saw a good soundtrack on Man of Fire movie but i think after u see this movie and listen the soundtrack u relive again the movie and even the chars fears.... Also i saw they have an album with all the songs from the movie. i think i'll buy it because it really deserve :DDo you know other shocking movies like this one.
