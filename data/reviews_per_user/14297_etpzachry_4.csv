Iron Man 3," Exceptionally well done and fun the entire time.
","I'll try to keep this brief because there are a lot of things I can say about the movie. First off, it's not like the comics. That's fine, it's not the comics. It takes ideas and themes from comics and makes it into something new. That's not a problem, it's just something new. If you had a problem with the spider in SpiderMan being genetically altered instead of radioactive, this is not the movie for you. The only complaint I can actually manage to form is that Tony Stark seems to have an issue with anxiety throughout most of the film and then it ends up going away because he begins tinkering around, even though he has been tinkering around the entire film. I'm not sure if it even goes away, because he seems to have no problem when faced with a real threat, only when he is out in public with no imminent danger.Graphics are amazing as always, I had some issues with the 3D being out of focus sometimes in the corner but I'm assuming it was a projector problem. Story line was easy to follow along with and I personally think well managed. It's very eventful and I can't really recall a moment that was boring. RDJ really does make the movie though and does an amazing job of keeping every scene lively and entertaining.",9,28,48,4 May 2013
This Is the End," Terrible at trying to relate to common people, but funny as heck
","Starting off the movie is incredibly slow. Over the first 20 minutes or so we are subjected to watching a bunch of successful drunk and stoned idiots, and they like to make that very apparent, enjoy the perks of wealth and fame. That's irritating for me. I've worked hard my entire life and don't get to go out and buy a 3D large screen television just so my friend can get high and play video games when he visits (That's an actual scene!). They spend a lot of time talking about how they want to make more movies so they can get drunk/high and hang out and be funny while making cart loads of money. They hang out a party filled with celebrities in a very luxurious house and we find out the owner is an idiot and just a bad person all around. They are supposed to be playing themselves and if that's true then I HATE them as people.However after that, it quickly ramps up and is actually pretty funny. It sometimes stretches jokes out too far or gets too dumb, but over all the movie is actually really good. Aside from the beginning the only other complaint I have is the end. They try to shoehorn in some of the worst morals ever and then follow up with the worst green-screen running effect I've seen recently and a completely unimaginative ending and jokes about how they like getting high and partying.If you just cut out the entire beginning scene, it's just Seth Rogen and a friend running to another friends house when the apocalypse starts, which is fine. I don't need any back story on why you guys are friends or exposition that goes out the window once survival is on the line. Cut out the last 8 minutes and it's ending on a perfect note. Remember, just because it's a comedy it doesn't have to end with a joke especially when it takes you 5 minutes to get there. I can't tell if it's padding or just bad writing and editing, but this movie was very close to being amazing if not a bit short.I won't give it higher marks because it's just so infuriating and I don't think that Seth Rogen could even comprehend why it's not entertaining to see complete failures enjoying so many luxuries and being able to party and get high all the time. I get it. You're rich. Now stop rubbing it in my face.",7,2,5,4 July 2013
Man of Steel," Ignore ratings lower than 4 and higher than 8
","First off I want to point out the ratings issue I'm having with this. The movie wasn't terrible to the point where it deserves less than 3 stars, it wasn't Battlefied Eart level of bad. Also it's not in anyway a 9+ movie, just too many small issues that really bring it down a bit. I think this movie is plagued with either Hate it (1 star! This movie literally gave me cancer now I have to schedule surgery) or love it (OMG! 10 STARS! Beats Citizen Kane!) syndrome.The movie itself has some issues that really seem to deter from the enjoyment of the film.Zod as a villain was a good pick and he was almost a great villain. He had the actor and the motivation, but the execution was off from becoming what could be one of the best movie villains. Zod begins the movie trying to save Krypton just like Jor-el but with slightly different execution, this is great. Zod and crew escape Krypton's death and go to search for any other signs of Kryptonian life only to find themselves alone, again wonderful and really sets the tone for his desire to save his race. When he appears on Earth he demands Kal-el to surrender or he will attack the planet, could have been a bit more soft spoken here. When they began their message they start with the message 'You are not alone' which is delivered in a rather ambiguous way, had they followed it with 'we are the last survivors of our planet and search for Krypton's lost son' and had Zod been interested in bringing Kal-el into his ship's crew it would have set a better tone. The final issue is that Zod wants to terraform the planet and kill all humans. Why? There is no motivation for him to do this outside of inconvenience to Kryptonians in Earth's atmosphere. There are several ways to handle this. Say Earth's atmosphere is poisonous to Kryptonians and shorten their long life span, or say that his ship is out of fuel for interplanetary travel and Earth is their absolute last chance to bring about a new Krypton. It could have been about two men trying to save their people, but only one of their people can survive. Instead Zod is almost comically evil at this point when he was an otherwise amazing villain. There is even a scene when Zod begs Superman not to damage one of the ships because it's the only one with a Genesis chamber (which will allow future Kryptonians to be born) and Superman lasers the ship in half. They portrayed both Superman and Zod's struggle rather poorly at this point.The romance between Superman and Lois Lane is a bit forced in there. Zod even has Lois Lane brought in with Superman, despite having absolutely no reason to do so and they just throw her into a storage room at their earliest opportunity. Then Superman decides to make out with Lois at ground zero of an alien invasion where there are several skyscrapers and office buildings in rubble around them. Nobody even seems to care that thousands are probably dead or injured.However the movie has many positive aspects going for it. The story and pacing can be a bit jarring with the changes in setting, time, and tone but overall is pulled off fairly well. The story itself sets up a good foundation for a franchise with an injured nation wondering if they can trust our adopted alien guard. Overall I think it's pretty good for a superhero movie and definitely worth seeing.",8,2,4,19 June 2013
Lucy," Bad Sci-fi + Bad Action = Waste of time.
","First off the character Lucy is the ultimate Mary Sue. Immediately after exposure to Plottainium she gets the powers of God. I'm not even joking. She has omnipresence and was able to control things from across the planet immediately after exposure. The second this happens all interest in the character is lost since she is unstoppable. Imagine Neo from the Matrix fighting an army of Paul Blart Mall Cops. To top it off she comes off as very wooden, which makes sense really since nothing will affect her so she might as well not care about anything.The fight scenes are actually rather forced in. I don't even know how to describe this part of the story. The drug dealers keep going after Lucy, but it doesn't matter since Lucy could fight off the Justice League while balancing the National Budget without blinking. This is an action movie where all action is pointless. Way to go!I can't even describe the sheer amount of apathy this movie has imbued upon me. Within such a short amount of time I found myself unable to care in the slightest because the main character is invincible and talks in such BS nonsense jargon that she may as well been speaking in Klingon without subtitles for all the good it would do. I can not honestly recommend this movie to anyone. If you like senseless violence with a strong female lead going around to get vengeance on organized criminals, go rent Kill Bill.",5,5,23,27 July 2014
