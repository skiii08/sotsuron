3:10 to Yuma," Director James Mangold is finally keeping his promise
","An inspired story packed with action, tension, plot twists, detailed and complex main characters as well as supporting ones that walk the walk and talk the talk, a very clever casting, and here you go: Director James Mangold has finally made good on the promise he gave us with 'Copland' ten years ago ('Walk The Line' in 2005, Jonny Cash's biography was the first sign of his redemption). '3:10 to Yuma' is one western that doesn't try to pay its respects to the genre or use it as a pretense: it's a bona fide action thriller but at the same time, it is totally modern in the way it poses some of the undying dilemmas humans may face in rough times. It even has an ending that permits the viewer to wonder about the next steps and the ultimate fate of those still standing -something Holywdood usually refrains from these days, preferring to show us everything at the end, so that we don't need to think or imagine about anything afterwards. I will remember this one.",9,3,7,24 March 2008
Blood Diamond," A film to be taught in Film schools
","'Blood Diamond' has essentially three endings, each representing a different era of Hollywood film-making -and these endings are sequenced in the same order that the periods they represent. I ticked 'contains spoiler' just in case, but I won't go into plot specifics. I think any mildly experienced viewer will recognize what I am referring to, while watching the film. The first ending is the Dramatic Hollywood, when people wanted to live drama for the shake of it, because drama intensified dreaming and people where a little more romantic than today. The second ending is the Family Hollywood, where the only thing of value in this wealthy world is family, its bonds, endurance and continuance. The third ending is Politically Correct Hollywood, where 'a few good (wo)men' stand up against evil corporations, and not only do they win their personal fight, but they change permanently they way business is done. These three endings, are sequenced in a totally linear and essentially unconnected way, and that's the weakness of this otherwise excellent and disturbing film, but also the reason why it should be taught or at least referenced in Film Schools.",7,0,0,24 March 2008
Inside Man," Not your std Bank Robbery
","Spike Lee peppers a standard master-mind bank robbery story with his socially-conscious director's eye - and the result is well worth seeing. The camera is a bit more focused on creating atmosphere than just shoving the action in your face, and characters are not what you would expect from a std production. Let's just mention black detective K.Frazier(D.Washington), with a dirty mouth and masterfully bordering on caricature (but since it is a black director shooting this, nobody will complain about political correctness!). Passing but clever and humorous social commentary on America's preconceptions works well with the action. Finally, would you nowadays expect to hear in a big-time movie somebody calling Jodie Foster a (excuse my language, but it is heard loud and clear on screen) 'magnificent c***'?",7,1,1,19 August 2006
