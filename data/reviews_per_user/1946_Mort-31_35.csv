Catch Me If You Can," A film about the consequences of divorce
","There are two reasons which made me unable to enjoy this original and amusing story from A to Z. One is Leonardo DiCaprio, who, unfortunately, has the leading part in this film. He plays an 17-year-old boy who looks ten years older than he is, all right but he absolutely failed to convince me that he is really only 17. Sometimes he tries to play particularly `childish' in order to emphasize his real age but everything else  marrying, cheating, etc.  he does like Leonardo would do it, not like a minor whose parents got divorced (no matter how super-intelligent this minor may be).The other problem is that this is a Steven Spielberg film. I was looking forward to see it because I thought maybe Spielberg has, for a change, chosen to tell a good-humoured story about a good-humoured sly fox in a good-humoured way. And I guess, any other director would have done so. But Spielberg would never get away from his crucial but corny theme: family. And he would make a family film out of every subject put in his hands. And this, in my opinion, harms the film very much. A movie based upon a true story can never be really true. So Spielberg had the chance to decide to skip famiy sentimentalities. But he didn't.If you want to see a good film on family, watch The Royal Tenenbaums or the Danish documentary Family. If you want to see Catch Me If You Can, do so. It is really entertaining, brilliantly filmed and well acted by the whole cast with the exception of Leonardo DiCaprio. But do not be so naïve to give Steven Spielberg a second chance.",6,1,3,3 April 2003
Meet the Parents," The simple every-dayembarrassments of life
","The ideal cast for the part of Gaylord Focker was Ben Stiller. We can imagine a girl wanting to marry him but we can't imagine a father wanting him to be his son-in-law. I think Ben Stiller just had to play himself. The characters in this movie are not exaggerated. They exist, believe me. And that's what I find so great about it: it discovers the simple every-day embarrassments of life. Life is not like in the movies: things do not simply work!I didn't laugh very often during the movie, but I grinned without interruption from MARRY ME MAP` right until the end. For me, Meet the Parents` is one of the most perfect romantic comedies since let's say Four Weddings and a Funeral`.",9,0,0,13 October 2001
The Big Lebowski," Couldn't follow - who cares?!
","After The Hudsucker Proxy`, this was the Coens' second movie that couldn't fully satisfy me. I like their films and this is also a very funny and unique one, but somehow I feel they didn't work very long with it, they didn't concentrate and it wasn't important for them. Funny, my critics about this one are exactly the opposite of those I have about O Brother, Where Art Thou?`. There, I felt they neglected the dialogue. Here, the dialogues are Coen-like (Give us ze munny Lebowski or we cut off your Johnson!`) but I missed the visual fascination of earlier movies. And the story is really, really confusing. I'm not sure, if they understood it themselves. But now let me get to the positive aspects: Carter Burwell's music always works; the actors are fabulous, especially John Goodman and  in a completely new kind of role  Steve Buscemi! The Coens can be lucky to have such a well-tempered cast and crew, consisting mainly of their closer friends they have already worked with several times. Jeff Bridges is also great. What else do you need? It's definitely not the right movie to explore the Coen universe  take Barton Fink`, Raising Arizona`, Miller's Crossing` or O Brother` instead. But if you just want an evening of non-mainstream-fun, watch Lebowski.",8,0,2,31 December 2000
Unbreakable," Rather equal
","An interesting question: If M. Night Shyamalan had made `Unbreakable' before `The Sixth Sense', what would have happened? I think, the world would have praised `Unbreakable', nominated it for some Academy Awards and then said about the second movie: Well, it's almost as good as the first one.In fact, I think these two Shyamalan movies are rather equal. The quality of cinematography, music and acting is the same in both pictures, the story is mysterious enough to hold one's breath for 100 minutes and the ending presents us with a more or less unexpected surprise. Only the fact that in `Unbreakable' there is no fascinating kid, and that after the unbelievable `6th Sense'-ending a more brilliant twist is impossible, gave `Unbreakable' small chance to succeed equally.I admit, the ending of this movie went completely wrong. I don't mean the plot twist, I mean the screenplay and the directing. After I knew the truth, I had the impression, Shyamalan was in a hurry to finish the movie. Suddenly it was over. And showing texts which tell us what happened to the protagonists later like in a true story drama, is a really stupid idea in a mystery thriller like this.But apart from that, I enjoyed Unbreakable`, although I was already familiar with this new` kind of mystery-thriller-drama.",7,0,0,6 January 2002
Citizen Kane," A perfect mix of famous final twists
","Surely a revolutionary movie, a classic, an above that a quite entertaining story about a real man's (Hearst's) fictitious life. The Rosebud` element rules the movie, for someone who doesn't know it, at some points it's the only reason to go on watching. The final solution is similar to the one in The Shawshank Redemption`, so to say the perfect mix between the Usual-Suspects`-twist and the Sixth Sense`-twist: it gives answers to questions one hasn't asked but also satisfies the viewer by telling him  in the very last moment  what kept him watching impatiently.I don't have to mention that Orson Welles did a great job as director, showing stunning visual creativity (by 1940), but also his acting performance is remarkable because I think he was 25 years old and played Charles Foster Kane over a period of more than forty years and was still convincing, unlike other young actors later who won Oscars for elderly` roles.Citizen Kane` is not the best film ever made for me, but it has some great moments and it was done by a talented young man in spite of many difficulties, so it became a legend.",10,0,2,3 August 2001
Memento," Feel-good movie
","`Memento' is what I call a feel-good movie in a positive sense because it offers you more little I-see-experiences during two hours than any other thriller or crime movie before was able to. By seeing half of the plot beginning with the chronologically last scene, every scene makes the viewer ask questions of more or less important character: `How did Leonard come there?' `Why is he doing this and that?', and in one of the following (=previous) scenes we get the answers, when we have actually just forgotten the question. Really, Christopher Nolan not only plays with the short-time memory of his main character, but also with ours!Of course, `Memento' is not a `great movie'; it's not revolutionary because it's hard to imitate it well (which is not at all a bad thing). But it's a completely unique movie like `Being John Malkovich' or `The Truman Show'. Strangely, this kind of movies has always been underrated, not by the audience but by critics and the Academy. `Memento' is absolutely constructed; the base idea itself is what rules the whole movie. And  particularly with Guy Pearce, that blonded, mimeless main actor  it remains cold. No warmth. That's why it is not a `great movie' for me, but it is a feel-good movie and shows absolute technical perfection. 9 out of 10.",9,0,1,12 November 2001
Lost in Translation," Strange encounter
","My favourite actors are those who have their own special hilarious humour and do not completely lose it when cast in a so-called 'serious' or 'sad' movie. Bill Murray is such an actor. My favourite films are those like Punch-Drunk Love and Lost in Translation, where directors have used comical actors in non-comedies in intelligent ways, using their well-known kind of humour and playing with audiences' expectations. Coppola has written the role of Bob Harris for Bill Murray, and no one else yet known would have done a better job than him.But not only when you focus on its male lead, Lost in Translation is a wonderful film. Scarlett Johansson (of whom I admit I had never heard before) is young but strong, beautiful and mysterious, the perfect cast for the strangely fragile Charlotte she portrays. The 'chemistry' between the two is fantastic, although they are of different age and experience.The first thirty minutes are funnier than most of what I saw this year. Afterwards the film retires a bit, becoming slower and more openly melancholic without giving up its humorous approach completely. How could it? The strange encounter between two strange people and a country which is even stranger must result in laughter at least a couple of times: be it a light or a depressed kind of laughter.And then there is Tokyo. I don't know how it comes but Coppola showed me this town quite like I imagined it to be (without ever having been there) but from very distant angles, which makes it appear really beautiful as well, not just gaudy, hectical and sterile.I think I should go to see this movie once again. But doing so, I believe, would only make me love it even more than I do now.And I should visit Tokyo.",8,0,0,18 October 2003
"Monsters, Inc."," Animation becomes ordinary
","Whereas much of the success of films like `Toy Story' or `A Bug's Life' is a result of the fact that the phenomenon of entire computer animation was a fairly new genre, now gradually this plus gets lost. More and more frequently, computer animated movies about various cute creatures are made and audiences aren't surprised any more about the endless possibilities of computer techniques. Moreover, I believe that with `Shrek', the genre already reached its climax as well as its ironic turn. What could follow?`Monsters, Inc.' provides less laughs than `Shrek', it doesn't have the sensational character of former computer animation features. Of course the monster world and its population are nice and imaginative, but the story started off a little too complicated. It is becoming harder and harder to fulfil the task of creating `human' situations in a world of non-humans, so the basic structures are getting more and more far-fetched. However, there were some surprising features, especially towards the end, which made this (children's) film something special, also for adults: the ice sequence for instance, and that magnificent door-machine. All in all, not more than a lovely evening at the movies.",7,1,3,7 May 2002
Bridget Jones's Diary," Ironic?
","MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS.Why is it that in `women's films' women appear particularly unable to survive without a man on their side? But I don't want to write a contribution to the battle of the sexes. I want to comment on this movie.I had a good laugh, I have to admit. Maybe I would have enjoyed myaself more, if there hadn't been two girls sitting beside me, close to a nervous breakdown each time Hugh Grant appeared on the screen. The most stunning effort is of course Renee Zellweger's courage to completely destroy her outward appearance and look like the `average woman' instead of a sexy super-model (I suppose, that was the idea). Hugh Grant, like him or not, has great fun in the part of the macho guy. And Colin Firth does a good job as a phlegmatic cynic, though I am not sure whether I wanted Bridget to decide for him rather than for Hugh Grant.The problem of the film is that while it is some kind of ironic response to romantic comedies, it turns out to be nothing else after some time. The ending is terrribly happy and conventional. But if you rent the film, don't turn off during the end credits! You would miss the very best joke of the whole film (`My name is Ellen.')!",6,0,0,31 July 2002
Fargo," It's that whiteness ...
","I always found that snow has something frightening. The Coen brothers were the first to make a film on it: huge plane areas covered with one colour that looks cleaner than all the white T-shirts in the washing powder commercials. Beginning with the very first scene, the brothers play with this image right until the end. And then: the red blood on the white snow... it seams like a picture but it's real. Many people say that it is their best film but that's only because it was the most successful. Most of the movies they made before were much better than Fargo`, but enough about that. It's a masterpiece: A great thriller, unconventional, black-humoured, nihilistic and very, very cruel. In this story, the best worked-out plans are senseless. There is no winner in the game. And in the end, many open questions ...",9,0,0,31 December 2000
American Beauty," I agree
","Among many critics of American Beauty` I found exactly one negative. Almost everybody likes this film and, although I have to agree with the author of that bad critic in a few points, it is really almost perfect. I would not say the story is new, it's just the old American-Dream-loser-story presented again in a quite exaggerated way, but who cares? The topic will be interesting as long as the American Dream exists and if there is a good film about it, it's this one. Kevin Spacey was the logical cast for the male lead, but Annette Bening gives a surprisingly superb performance as his wife. Also the young actors do a good job. The best stories are those you can't summarize in a few sentences. I don't think it's necessary to go too much into detail, I just wanted to add one more absolutely positive comment. If you haven't seen American Beauty` yet, go and watch it.",8,0,0,6 April 2001
The Patriot," One? A thousand!
","THE Patriot? This movie is full of patriots! And I hate this unbelievable idealistic stuff! The whole thing is even more absurd because they had the film directed by a German, Roland Emmerich.But as I'm neither American nor British nor a patriot I shouldn't go too deep into this aspect. And so I have to admit that it's a three hour movie during which I hardly ever looked at my watch. The fighting scenes were exciting and authentic, Mel Gibson acted the same as in all his previous films, the screenwriter put in some lovely humorous scenes, and the story - surprise, surprise! - was not always predictable: It was more 'cruel' for the viewer than the story in other mainstream movies. Entertainment factor: 9/10Did you notice that with landscapes the camera always started with the same move? First filming at a rather low level and then moving up. That shows that director Emmerich lacks ideas also in his newest movie. (It wasn't much better with 'Independence Day'.) Quality factor: 2/10Together that makes a rating of 6 out of 10.",7,2,3,5 September 2000
Being John Malkovich," Speechless
","When I saw this movie first, I was really speechless. I could only laugh. I love everything surrealistic but this movie breaks everything I saw before. First of all, there are amazing acting performances, especially by Catherine Keener and Cameron Diaz, but also by John Cusack and - people seem to forget about him - John Malkovich. Then the story is so crazy and insane but still offers thousands of possibilities to interpret it and to guess what sense it could make. This film should have won an Oscar, at least for its uniqueness. And Charles Kaufman and Spike Jonze should soon make another film together!",10,1,3,5 September 2000
Underground," Emir's home
","I only know the cinema version of this movie, I suppose the TV version which runs five hours, may be a little too long. Cut to two and a half hours, `Underground' is a wonderful cinematic experience, as far as visual perfection is concerned. One bizarre, great picture after the other, Emir Kusturica tells the history of his country concentrating on a family. But don't mind, you do not have to be interested in Yugoslavian history to like this movie. It's simply beautiful and powerful. The acting is a little exaggerated as usually in Kusturica's films, but maybe that's the temper of Yugoslavian people.",8,3,7,3 September 2001
The Usual Suspects," That's real crime stuff
","O, my God! We have seen so many films with gangster bosses and ordinary criminals and police officers and much more usual suspects! It's unbelievable that this movie is from the year 1995; judging by the plot it could be from the 1940s: so pure, so absolutely perfect in its being a thriller, a whodunnit, a riddle for the audience!The solution, of course, though presented in a visually stunning way, is not what I expect from a good  punch-line`. *******SPOILER HERE!******* I mean, they made things easy for themselves with the ending by negating the whole story, saying: All you've seen the last 90 minutes, it's not true.` It's that kind of solution, where you feel great when you see it, but later, thinking about it, you realize it wasn't that creative. It was so with me, at least. *******SPOILER OVER!*******However, this film is worth watching, not only because it's a classic example for its genre, but also in order to see Kevin Spacey in his first Oscar-role, playing a completely different kind of character then in his second, American Beauty`.",8,1,3,31 December 2000
Man on the Moon," For people who don't know Kaufman
","As I heard, the film Man on the Moon` tells Andy Kaufman's biography quite authentically. I didn't know the man before but he must have been really hard to handle. He provoked lots of ethic discussions, and the film corresponds to them. For people who haven't taken part in the excitements Kaufman caused at that time, the ethic questions appear during watching the film. Is it funny what Kaufman does? Does he intend anything special with it? How far can he go and when do we start feeling betrayed? Actually, Kaufman himself seems to have had more fun on stage than his audience.Man on the Moon` is not told like the biography of a man we already know. Maybe Kaufman fans will be bored because there are no surprises for them. But at the end and in the end Forman carries Kaufman's humour one step further and, by doing that, gives him an appropriate reference, I think: the way he directs Kaufman's death is as ambiguous as the way Kaufman would have done it: It outrages one part of the audiences and makes the other part smile sadistically. Well, I liked it.",9,0,0,3 August 2001
Good Will Hunting," A debut - a little immature, but okay
","Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, two good friends, as we all know, presented their first screenplay. It's about  not them but guys similar to them: young, intelligent, but very insecure concerning their future. I guess, this is how many script debuts are like. Luckily, they found some good actors with Minnie Driver and Robin Williams and a famous director, so they managed to make a solid movie that doesn't get boring and makes you think about life. It's a small film, with no particular peculiarites (except the fact that Will is a maths genius, a fact that doesn't dominate the film as much as I believed before I saw it). This makes it even more remarkable to me that it became so successful and won two Oscars. 6 stars out of 10.",6,4,8,3 February 2001
Mulholland Drive," Watch it twice or give up
","David Lynch says he doesn't want to manipulate his audience. I can't quite believe this. While I was watching the film and trying to understand, there was more than one moment where I could imagine Lynch sitting somewhere, watching us and laughing sadistically.But I don't grudge him that pleasure. Lynch has done a great job in thrilling his audience, which is actually not so easy any more. There are unforgettable scenes in `Mulholland Dr.', some of them even funny.But, although this film is almost beyond any possible criticism there is a bit left to criticise about it. If I hadn't known that it is a TV series pilot that was later re-cut as a movie for cinema, I could have guessed. Although I am far from `understanding' the deep meaning of the movie (to manage that, I would have to watch it a second time), I feel that there are somewhat too many unnecessary features, too much short scenes filmed just anyhow. And it's a pity that TV stations refused to produce Lynchs mystery series because as such it would have been absolutely brilliant and I would have watched every single episode. In cinema, `Mulholland Dr.' is also a great experience. But there is that one drop of bitterness that it actually doesn't belong there.",7,0,1,12 February 2002
A Clockwork Orange," A lot of Burgess
","A Clockwork Orange is probably the most merciless story about society, the most convincing of critical statements ever made. We awe it first to Anthony Burgess, then to Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick, while treating Burgess's text respectfully, made the very best out of the wonderful plot. He managed to bring it across visually with almost more wit and creativity than any reader of the book can imagine for himself. He crowds his stylish futuristic world with an excellent leading actor and with an uncountable number of (stereo)types that are so funny and so funnily played that the movie is not depressing despite its disturbing topic. When during the end credits the song `Singin' in the Rain' rings out, I will sing along jollily, despite what the song stands for in the movie. Generally, the music, virtuously conducted, is an important element in the film and  again  a brilliant one. And the production design! The Korova Milkbar alone is a masterpiece.A Clockwork Orange is Kubrick's most original film  although it does not have an original screenplay.",10,1,2,22 February 2003
Groundhog Day," Nothing could go wrong
","Once Harold Ramis had the base idea of this story, nothing could go wrong. These films that base on a completely new kind of plot framework are the most enjoyable ones because whatever happens, it cannot be corny. I'm talking about The Truman Show`, Being John Malkovich`, Forrest Gump` and also Groundhog Day`. These films HAVE to become classics.Bill Murray plays the character he always plays: cynical, cold and calculating, but likeable for the viewer. The dialogues are catching and hilarious, the ending is not a Hollywood ending, it can't be because  well, I already explained why. I couldn't help giving ten points to this film. It's one of the most creative and perfect comedies of the 1990s!",9,0,1,3 February 2001
The Red Violin," I don't know if I am interested in the fate of a musical instrument
","I was quite distressed, when they repeated the promising auction scene again and again, and, instead of continuing with it, they switched back to all these rather unnecessary episodes from the past, where all the characters were portrayed so roughly  obviously because there wasn't a lot of runtime left for each of the episodes  that the stories become, well, not interesting.As Jim Jarmusch has shown us in `Night on Earth', it is possible to give perfect character descriptions of two or three people within a small story of twenty minutes. The makers of `The Red Violin' could have achieved this as well, but they were not interested in people, they were interested in a musical instrument. I don't know if I am interested in the fate of a violin. In fact, the score of this movie is really beautiful and unusual. John Corigliano has absolutely deserved his Academy Award. It's for his music that I give this movie 4 points out of 10.",4,6,14,6 January 2002
Eyes Wide Shut," Being in old Stanley's brain
","Arthur Schnitzler's Traumnovelle` was the model Kubrick based his film upon, and after all those almost perverse details that were heard before Eye Wide Shut` was released, it's amazing how slavishly it sticks to that model. For me, this means nothing good because I was as unsuccessful in finding out what Schnitzler wanted to say as I was with Kubrick. Schnitzler had at least a fine, readable language, which of course gets lost in an English language film.I saw the film shortly after it was released here, but I remembered it when I saw The Cell` recently. The two movies belong to dissimilar genres and try to meet completely different requirements, but the intensity of their pictures and how they prefer them to everything else, even the story. The director of The Cell` justified himself by a reference to the genre he comes from (videoclips), Stanley Kubrick, being dead, couldn't justify himself any more, and I can't imagine what he would have said, if he was still alive. After his masterpieces Full Metal Jacket`, The Shining` and several others, Eyes Wide Shut` seems like the late work of an unenthusiastic old artist, lacking ideas, full of emotionalism and overwhealming pictures, obsessed with sex, visually and in the dialogues. Also the characters (Tom Cruise giving one of his weak performances and Nicole Kidman who is not more than a supporting actress here) seem to think about nothing else. Being in old Stanley Kubrick's brain.How badly will he rate this movie, some of you might ask. And here is the surprise: Speaking purely emotionally, remembering the feeling I had during watching the film and immediately afterwards, I must admit that the film was a) not boring and b) absolutely fascinating, and two years later I can't, I just can't tell why. Obviously, there was still something, something not tangible left of Kubrick's genius. However, it's a pity that he's not among us. 6 points out of",6,0,1,6 April 2001
It's a Wonderful Life," MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS: Don't read this if you believe the title doesn't take the ending away!
","I don't wonder why this movie is among the top 30 movies. It's an American classic, you don't need more. If this was a European movie, it would get bad critics and ratings. But with the Americans we tolerate it. They are like that. The film they like best is the film with the happiest happy-end that is so happy that it's already in the title. Where I live, they dare to show it once a year, at Christmas, and that's it. It's typical for the American people that they adore movies where someone is shown by  God Himself how much the world needs him! That's what gives them hope that their own life isn't meaningless. The problem is: That man the film is about has in most cases nothing to do with them. He is an angel himself, saved two people's life and gave homes to many poor people in a small village. Who else can say that about oneself? The plot is constructed, so the film isn't valuable to give you hope and people who realize that are rather made sad then happy.America doesn't realize and that's why it loves this movie. Fine. It's not a bad film at all! It's really enjoyable, even humorous at the beginning, and James Stewart is a great actor. But again, I'm sure this film would have been fallen into oblivion within 50 years of movie history if it was a European film. It's a Wonderful Life` is one of many bizarre drolleries of the American kitsch society.",6,8,19,31 December 2000
The Green Mile," Poor younger sibling
","Stephen King, Frank Darabont, jail. These are the key words that connect The Shawshank Redemption`, one of America's most popular movies and The Green Mile`. There are slight differences in the base ideas of the two films and for me  probably the greatest fan of Shawshank`  exactly these are also the differences in quality. Darabont's film no. 1 was too perfectly made and his no. 2 reminds too much of it without being able to compete with it. Somehow the fantastic elements in no. 2 appear disturbing to someone who remembers how well no. 1 worked without anything supernatural. Actually, it's not Frank Darabont's fault that The Green Mile` falls behind Shawshank`; it's Stephen King's. For instance, there is also a twist in the end in no. 2, but it's definitely not as great as the one in no. 1.Something Darabont hasn't forgot is how to tell a story in cinema and how to produce an authentic atmospehere, though I don't think that there were so many humane prison officers at that time. Michael Clark Duncan was a real fluke: He had no particularly great role at all but he stole the show from everybody. Unfortunately (or luckily), he has a too extraordinary look to get ordinary roles in the future; so we won't see him very often. Tom Hanks did a good job; of course, anyone else could have played his role equally well.The Green Mile` is a long, fascinatic epos with not two but many outstanding actors, slowly and patiently directed by a man who seems to specialize in makeing films of Stephen King's jail books. Logically, the next movie should come in 2004.",7,0,2,6 April 2001
The Shawshank Redemption," The best cinematic way of storytelling
","This is my favourite movie of all time. I saw it when it was first shown in German free-TV. I was gripped from the beginning because the story was told in the Stephen King-type epic slowness with always something happening. Then, about 100 minutes into the film, there was THE scene. Those who have seen the movie will know which one I mean. It was like a slap in the face but it didn't hurt. It was just inspiration. The feeling decreased very slowly because there were other, smaller slaps following. Since then, this has been my favourite film and I haven't seen any better. I wasn't surprised that it was nominated for seven Oscars!But when I looked it up in the IMDb I was surprised that it's among the top ten and so popular because I hadn't heard anything about it before. It was not successful at all in Europe. All the happier I was because I felt confirmed in my enthusiasm. I mean, I have to admit that the main reason for choosing this as my favourite was the finesse of the most satisfying punchline` in movie history. I like characters who are unbreakable because of their mental power. Yes, it's definitely a movie about hope. But it would be unfair to forget about all the other elements:Morgan Freeman is one of the most mature actors in the world. He always chooses roles with quality. And Tim Robbins is a very changeable actor: Just think about Cadillac Man` or Bull Durham` and the characters he played there. But also all the minor characters are described very precisely and integrated in the plot. It's not just a couple of episodes: it's one huge, magnificent story.Roger Deakins, the favourite cinematographer of (my favourite directors) Joel & Ethan Coen helps to make it not just an epic, also a cinematic masterpiece. And Frank Darabont is a fascinating director because he concentrates on the story and doesn't try to push himself to the fore by any facilities in directing, except THE scene I already mentioned. All of the seven Oscars should have been won by The Shawshank Redemption`. With all due respect for Forrest Gump`.",10,0,0,3 February 2001
Blow," Falling into biographical boredom
","I suppose the only reason, why I found so many comparisons to 'Traffic' among the user comments here, is that both movies deal with drugs. That's all they have in common because the way they deal with the topic and the attitude to it is completely different. And: 'Traffic' tells a bunch of more or less fictitious stories whereas 'Blow' is a biography.In the first half of the movie, I liked the acting, I liked the directing, it was a fast entertaining film and the fact it was a true story only made it more impressive. Later on, not abruptly but slowly, 'Blow' takes over that usual slight boredom of biographies. That's a pity because it might make us forget the movie quite soon but on the other hand, what did we expect? Real lifes don't have a screenplay. They are not always dramatically ideal. Still, we should tell them authentically.At last, I can add one more chapter to 'Don't let young actors play old people'. How old is Johnny Depp? How old is Ray Liotta? Sorry, I tried very hard but I was unable to imagine that Liotta is Depp's son, although this time the make-up, especially both their 'beer-bellies' were quite all right.",6,0,0,17 August 2001
Shrek," Everybody
","Actually, there is nothing to criticise about this movie. It couldn't care less about any existing conventions or unwritten laws. Dreamworks Pictures presents a sarcastic parody of Disney's pictures, some kind of an inside fight between the two companies, but the movie hasn't much of an inside joke. There is mainly one winner in this discordance: the audience. We enjoy the playfulness of the screenplay, the cuteness of the characters, who are ugly but sweet (which was impossible before: in cartoons the good and nice and likable ones had to be beautiful) and their hilarious expressions of their faces: a real actor  I have to admit it  couldn't have done better. Only this movie and 'The Simpsons', my favourite TV series, have chosen to use the possibilities animation offers in such a sophisticated way and with such inventitiveness.Lots of anachronisms, concerning music, set-decoration and dialogue give you a wonderfully relieved feeling, and of course, you are laughing all the time. And they are not trying to get everything out of one joke, but present the next one just a few seconds later. Rarely have I laughed so freely so often during 85 minutes. Everybody is going to like this movie: adults of any educational level, and children equally. Maybe the very little kids shouldn't watch 'Shrek' yet but wait till they are older. They might not get some of the really sarcastic gags, which would be a pity. But of course, there are enough jokes everybody is able to enjoy, and some of them are predictable at last  not many. It's fine that Hollywood is gaining some self-irony through its numberous inner disputes.",9,0,0,3 August 2001
The Silence of the Lambs," Some new aspects
","When I first saw this film, I was about 14, lying in my bed, watching it in German on TV late at night, with the lights on, and almost falling asleep (probably actually dozing for a couple of minutes now and then). When I was waking up once, noticing Hannibal Lecter on my television screen, looking at me with his alive, clear eyes and speaking to me about screaming lambs, that was surely one of the most exciting moments in my movie-interested life. So it is definitely a good idea to see this at night, with one's concentration wandering away.Now I saw it again (at daylight!), and many other things struck me. The character of Catherine Martin is actually really cool. The snobbish daughter of a famous politician reacts to the terrible things that are done to her in an unusually offensive way - it looks as if she was never giving up.And then did you notice how utterly serious this film is? There is not a single funny scene in it. And this is really great! Which other feature film today manages to be taken seriously by everybody and never being unintentionally funny although it does not have a single moment of irony? The humorous take-outs attached to the DVD version seem really weird and out of place when you are in the mood this unbelievable film creates.",9,2,3,9 October 2004
Sweet and Lowdown," Came exactly at the right time
","MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS. Woody Allen wanted to make a movie about his passion: jazz. He used his early techniques (interviews, playing different versions of a scene) and made something completely new with them: a biography. But Woody wouldn't be Woody, if the biography wasn't a complete lie. And he wouldn't be Woody, if the fact that the biography is a complete lie was not the main point of his movie.Emmet Ray, the second best jazz-guitar player in the world` doesn't exist and so his life, his character and his bizarre ideas lose a lot of their fascination. The cruel thing is that people who haven't read the critics or the comments on the movie, will believe every minute of the first part and then, when Allen's sadistic soul gets the better of him, they will realize that they have been fooled. I'm sure that this was Woody Allen's intention. Once Emmet Ray's made-up biography loses footing on the ice, Allen distracts the viewer's interest from him and begins to play with the possibilities of an author.The reason why the acting performances are so great, is that Allen instructs the actors, as if they were important. They are supposed to be real and to live in their roles, no matter how crazy and irreal the story becomes. The movie is the sadist's in the first place, but it's also about what it is about: jazz. We may not forget that, and we may not forget how fine Allen's casting is again: Sean Penn, Samantha Morton: brilliant!Sweet and Lowdown` came exactly at the right time. Woody Allen is a mature director now and so he can finally use the playful methods of his first period much better. At that time, the movies seemed somewhat immature; Sweet and Lowdown` doesn't, although it is as little serious as, for instance Take the Money and Run`. Sweet and Lowdown` is surely not Woody Allen's most important film, but one of his funniest and one of his very best.",9,0,0,3 August 2001
Identity," I don't understand the complaints
","!!! SPOILERS AHEAD !!!A lot has been written and interpreted about this movie, in user comments, external reviews and board posts. Many users have complained about the plot twist in this film. Not about the first plot twist which introduces the last third of the movie but about the final twist. Obviously, these people didn't like the ending because it was not happy!!! The moment they relaxed and believed that things had turned out well they were forced to see that the 'killer personality' hadn't been defeated and that more murders would happen - also in reality.Oh dear, what an awful ending in a horror thriller!?!?I am utterly unable to understand how anyone could have a problem with this kind of ending. First of all, an evil-eyed kid attacking a woman in a beautiful landscape with a rake is clearly meant ironically, which means that a too-serious approach to this ending reveals a lack of humour in the critic. Irony is, in my opinion, an excellent answer to the recent inflation of 'mental-plot-twist' movies.Second, what the **** do people expect of a horror film where people are stabbed with baseball bats and where audiences are supposed to be screaming out loud at the revelation of a dead body? People who do not like to see dark or evil things in movies should have left to see Bambi ten minutes after the film began, shouldn't they?So, for me this is a fantastic conceptual thriller, very well acted, moody, scary, suspenseful - and highly intelligent.",8,0,0,5 October 2003
The Sixth Sense," I like that - but ...
","It is very difficult to write a good review about 'The Sixth Sense' without letting out the ending. To those who haven't seen the film yet: The whole film would be meaningless with any other ending. It was made only because of the ending. Every single scene, every shot exists for no other reason than to give a hint or to prepare the very last scene. The consequence of this is that the film seems very artificial to me; it couldn't be more constructed. Shyamalan shows us exactly as many scenes as possible. Other scenes we expect we do not see because they would tell us too much about the solution.I admit I'm fond of these stories where at the end you sit there with an open mouth, speechless and then you think about the film again and again and you find answers to thousands of questions you didn't ask. My favourite film is 'The Shawshank Redemption' because it has the most brilliant point since 'The Planet of the Apes'. But there they didn't need any talking dead people to tell a gripping story.I mean, this was a nice little movie with an interesting atmosphere, some exceptional actors (I don't mean Willis, I mean Osment and Collette) and a little bit of black humour. But I don't agree with the Oscar nomination for Best Picture and with the hymns of praises 'The Sixth Sense' got.And now watch the movie and then read my review again and you'll understand what I mean.",6,0,0,30 October 2000
Jackie Brown," Calm
","Like in the Pulp Fiction` segment with John Travolta and Samuel Jackson, we experience a certain, deplaced calmness here. The movie runs two and a half hours and singular scenes are longer than usual. There are hardly any violent scenes in the movie, no bloodshed; language is the only reason why I couldn't watch the movie before I was sixteen. The music is from the seventies and also quite slow and melancholic. Pam Grier was famous in the seventies and Robert Forster himself even looks like coming straight from a twenty-year old TV series. This calmness  that is the result of all these facts  had a great fascination on me. It produced a fantastic suspense and if the dialogues were not typical for Tarantino I would say, it's a very Hitchcock-like film.If there was an Oscar for casting, this film would have won it. That unusual mix of well-known and coming-back actors, all together doing a great job, makes the film most interesting from the start. 9 stars out of 10.Actually, there is nothing to complain about, as long as you see the film only once. When I saw it a second time, the dialogues started to get a little tiring and I asked myself: Do they really have to be so long each? So don't watch it twice one after the other.",9,0,1,8 February 2001
Gladiator," HOW COULD THAT HAPPEN?!
","Initially, I didn't want to comment on Gladiator` at all, but now, as it won so many Oscars, I think I should:How could that happen?! How could Hollywood sink so low and nominate this monstrous combination of pure commercial thinking and perverse blood lust for twelve Academy Awards, especially Best Actor and Supporting Actor (???), Best Writing, Best Director, Best Music and  Best Picture? Or is the Best Picture nomination only a result of the number of other nominations?It really hurts seeing how the American audience ignored the terrible way history is treated in Hollywood. Ridley Scott commercialized the Ancient Rome so obviously that one might believe he meant it ironically. But the movie is deadly serious (as is Oscar-winning actor` Russell Crowe who moves his face I think three times during the whole film!), so we are really supposed to believe that Maximus the Gladiator was Christian and hoped to meet his family again in the Hereafter. The whole story is so dumb that even eight-year old children should say they are too old for such nonsense.It is no argument pro Ridley Scott that he gave a second birth to the genre of the sandal movie`. The real Roman movies were historically more accurate, more intelligent and not so overloaded with glaring computer-animated visual backgrounds. Those were movies. Gladiator` is more like a videogame. An absolute disgrace happened on March 25th. It showed how poor in quality pictures the year 2000 was.",4,0,1,6 April 2001
Contact," The most fascinating opening scene in history
","This film is worth watching because of Jodie Foster who is beautiful and convincing in every movie and because of the special effects which produce fascinating pictures and an interesting mood. Apart from that, this movie is a little bit over-rated. There is too much ado about something that is not quite spectacular any more, the idea of life on other planets. The film is very long and not always gripping.But the opening scene is great! Different sounds and melodies one knows are heard, and the camera moves away from them further and further. The scene is very long but it's so beautiful both visually and acustically that you don't dare to breathe until it's over.",8,1,3,31 December 2000
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," If you don't know Coen, go and watch it!
","For me, being a great admirer of the Coen Brothers' movies, it is hard to rate this movie justly. Let me express it like this: It is better than most other films in this world but as a Coen baby it's only average. I'm afraid the two guys are getting older and losing the density of dialogue they once had in films like Barton Fink` or Miller's Crossing`. Their characters are getting shallower, their point is not in the characters any more, only in the plot and mainly in weird, atmospheric moments, which they still do better than any other American director. They always used fantastic technical effects to the full  photography, music, post-production. But in O Brother` they rely too much on those effects and leave the dialogue behind. In Barton Fink` & Co. you could at least belive that the film has a deep meaning (even if it hadn't). O Brother` is only a comedy  a most entertaining one, however.They haven't made many films. Maybe I'm being unfair, and the next one will be brilliant again, I mean, not ordinary brilliant but Coen-brilliant. I hope so. Come on, Joel & Ethan! Don't sleep! Keep fit!",8,0,0,31 December 2000
