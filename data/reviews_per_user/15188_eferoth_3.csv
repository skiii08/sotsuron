Sucker Punch," Visual feast
","Snyder, the director, continues to amaze me. His big-budget movies, including this one, are and stay highly entertaining. None of them are movies to satisfy deep thinking, but I'm rarely so glad to have spent the money. Dawn of the Dead delivered an updated Zombie experience. 300 did what it promised to do (putting the graphic novel into fitting visual form) and then came Watchmen. The only comic adaption that didn't leave me dissatisfied by 'blockbuster changes' to the source material. The things that were changed were for the better (ending), the things left out (island of artists, pirate comic) I didn't miss at all in the context of a movie.Hence I looked forward to his first original work. (Snyder directed and scripted Sucker Punch). The trailer itself pretty much forced me to go and catch this movie, and did it ever deliver.The movie plays out in different realities. There's the 'real' world, institutionalizing the main heroine into an insane asylum by her evil (possibly child-molesting) step-dad after the death of her mother. Once there the movie enters a fantasy world, reflecting the real one, but taking place in a burlesque, moulin-rouge with-further-pleasures- sort of establishment. Here Babydoll (the heroine) meets four other girls and wins their aid to escape their imprisonment. To do this they need to find five things. Each of those five missions is presented in a third reality. A reality were giant samurai and orks and dragons are just as real as WW1 Germans and Zeppelins and Mechas and robots. Its sort of Inception but with babes and about 50 different sailor-suits for Babydoll. Its not as confusing as it sounds, and for a movie thats basically a B-movie affair, the story is pretty good. Especially the ending, making a nice tie to the beginning, comes as a surprise, but makes sense in a very satisfying way.The director obviously played a lot of video-games and saw a lot of anime. There are visual references all over the place.And this is the biggest flaw I see in this movie. There's too much of it. Its like KillBill on steroids. There's so much going on, so many different sceneries to explore, that I found myself actually tired after two thirds of the running-time. (And I didn't even tire with the Matrix sequels) A second, more relaxed view might be needed to appreciate the sheer mass of visuals that went into this. It is, as many have written before a video game that you don't play, but watch and it is a pleasure to do so.In the end, this world wouldn't be a worse place without Sucker Punch, but its something that wasn't there before, and demands to be seen by anyone interested in a ride thats nowhere near to anything seen before.",9,2,6,9 April 2011
Public Enemies," How Technique ruins everything...
","Well. I was looking forward to this,but missed in in theaters. Rented it now and just felt to write something about this almost great movie. Almost great but only half the score...yeah... I know.Let's start with the good things. Depp was awesome as most of the time, albeit a bit limited in the space he was given as an actor. But it was quite refreshing to see him as something else than a pirate in what felt like a decade. (I liked em but... you know...) So was Bale, whose role was all in all cut a bit short for my taste. We need more Christian Bale movies. Him in the lead... no costume... Machinist anyone?The sets and costumes felt authentic. And I do get a certain thrill to see cars of the 30's... let alone guns and nightclubs and music (sadly not enough of the latter in this one). Sort of Road to Perdition like.Well onto the bad which is basically one thing and that cost this movie three stars in my eyes (would've probably been an 8/10 otherwise).Camera. Excuse the language but the camera sucked for 70 percent of the movie. Now I guess this was an artistic choice, like making it feel more documentary... like. Let me tell you something. That approach works for three kinds of film. Things that didn't happen or probably won't happen (Blair Witch, Cloverfield, Rec, District 9), Action Movies (wichevers just on at the moment) and DOCUMENTARIES!!!It doesn't work for Hybrids. It especially doesn't work for movies with Stars in it we've all known for quite a while playing out a story we've sort of known for quite a while. I buy a documentary style camera, if: A: I don't quite know where we're headed and B: I shut off my brain at the start of the movie or C: I don't know almost every face on screen.None of this is true for this movie. The whole shaky-hand camera-over the shoulder-limited to non-existing depth of field - forcibly none color-corrected (but still color-corrected) scenes in this movie just ticked me off. I was in the movie for about thirty minutes, where everything was still stylized Hollywood goodness, and it felt like something like Gone with the wind for a while. You know, like an old movie, like something we all know. Sink into it and enjoy, just go with it. Like something we all love once in a while. Even the first two robberies still were filmed that way, and all was good. Then the story took a turn for the worse for Dillinger an suddenly (and I MEAN SUDDENLY, we're treated to shaking hell described above, almost up to the end) the final two scenes are stylized again, and thats a good thing but only remind me of what might have been an instant classic for me.Well its not. For about two thirds of the movie I was just thinking: 'Keep that damn camera still for once you bloody bastard or at least put it on a rail!!!' thus ripping me out of the movie, thus ruining the whole experience, thus minus three stars... and I'm still generous here.",5,0,0,21 January 2010
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Don't let the nitpickers fool you...
","This is a good movie. Why? Because its fun to watch. There's no deep story, character development or anything else worth an Oscar, but its fun. Indiana Jones kind of fun. Its like an Action movie out of the eighties. Sadly its a little toned down to get a PG 12, but still.I for my part was pleasantly surprised how much of the games they put into this. Key elements are present (sands, parcouring, princess, evil advisers) and its all been packed into an unsurprising but fun to watch storyline.The acting was up to to the task at hand. I was pleased by the main leads, although I do hope that Gyllenhall doesn't permanently stay in the Blockbuster field. He's too good for that.The CG is OK but there's never that much of it. (Well, there is, but rarely in that screen filling in your face kind of way.) Watch this. Its fun, and sometimes thats all you need for a movie.Now... why I'm even writing this: Who the hell is looking for historical accuracy in this kind of movie? (and by the way...history IS written by the winners...) Moreso... who thinks this movie carries a political message? How? Where? When? Nitpickers with too much time on their hands, thats who. I'd use worse language, but then this probably wouldn't get posted. Seriously... just grow up and get a life not bashing things lower than your own self-determined event horizon.PS: Watch it!",7,1,3,30 May 2010
