The Ring," Scariest movie I have ever seen
","If you're looking for a gore-fest, you haven't found it.  If you're looking for a really, really deep psychological horror movie, then you've come to the right place.This movie is scary, will make you jump more than once, and keeps you in suspense almost all the way through.A lot of people I went with complained that there were many loose ends and unexplained elements at the end.  To these criticisms I say only this: use your head.  The movie gives you a multitude of clues, but it does not lead you by the hand.  As is typical of Japanese Ghost Stories (of which this movie is one - look for the original), not everything is explained, but many of the little things can be explained if you think them through enough.I would like to say for the record that I have never found a movie scary before in my life.  This movie is the first.",10,0,0,19 October 2002
