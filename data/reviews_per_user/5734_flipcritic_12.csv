Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Scenes are visionary, Acting is flat.
","There are almost no memorable characters in this movie, except for Darth Maul.  But he is limited to being a martial expert rather than a true evil presence in the movie.  Everybody else seems to be so self-conscious of what roles they are playing than being the characters they are supposed to portray.The story is an adequate setup for entire series.  The visuals are astounding.  The podrace scene is the true marvel of this movie.  It captures the essence of how thrilling Star Wars really is.  It outdoes all other action sequences in the episodes IV, V and VI.  Lightsaber scenes are spectacular, although  its ending is too easy to believe.I commend George Lucas for his vision.  But the actors selected for this film are badly miscast.  Compare this cast with Han Solo, Princess Leia, and Luke Skywalker, and you'll go Quin Gon who?Seeing R2D2 again was great!",6,0,1,5 July 1999
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Attack of the clones is right.
","There is one point in Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of The Clones, where Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) comments, 'I've got a bad feeling about this.'  He couldn't have put it any better.  It is this kind of exhausted dialogue that permeates the movie, worsened by the fact that almost all the human characters display almost no vigor, no drive, no purpose. For all its dazzling imagery, AOTC is surprisingly boring, until the last 40 minutes that is.I've read several reviews claiming that the visual texture of the film along with the complexity of its plot make it the best of the series.  Why?  Is a science-fiction movie considered great because of its special effects? Hell no.  No matter how good a movie looks, it is the characters that drive the story, otherwise we might as well just be watching video games.  A good plot also matters, but if the characters cannot move it along at a pace which the audience finds acceptable, then it's dead in the water.I will not attempt to explain the plot since it is basically a labyrithian (but not incomprehensible).  Aside from a spectacular chase sequence, the first hour of the movie is as exciting as a fifth-grade history lesson. All the characters talk about what has happened, what is happening, and what might happen.  That's it.  Sure the transitions between dialogue show fantastic scenes, but what a waste.  The visual energy quickly dissipates into boredom once the politicians start to speak (perhaps this is the only realistic thing in the movie).Consider The Lord of The Rings: The Fellowship of The Ring.  Sure it was three hours, and a lot of explanation was required for many moviegoers to understand what was unfolding.  But every character had purpose, an identity.  It was as if something truly great was at stake.  In AOTC, the actors come and go.  They recite, not embody.  Their personalities are so similar that they themselves are clones in their own way.  I guess I cannot really blame them since almost all of their scenes require them to be performed in front of blue screens.The story is interesting, but told drearily.  It is supposed to revolve around the romance between Senator Amidala (Natalie Portman - The Professional) and Anakin Skywalker.  If you thought the first act was bad, the romance in the next is breathtakingly fake.  I haven't seen a love story this yucky since Pearl Harbor.  When Amidala tells Anakin, 'I love you...' I just don't buy it.  What did she see in him (other than a teenager whining all the time)?  This is what a former Queen (with term limits apparently) finds attractive?  And how could anybody fall for his flimsy lines?Amidala: How you've grown! Anakin: You've grown too.  Grown more beautiful.Then they have a scene where she runs through the plains painfully reminiscent of The Sound of Music (which really made me laugh).  He does a balancing act on an alien cow to impress her.  And they end up in each others arms rolling on the grass.Pardon me while I throw up.Consider Spider-Man, where the relationship between Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson really seems authentic.  Peter doesn't need hokey lines to get with MJ.  He shows his concern by encouraging her when she is down.  By being their when she needs him (it probably helps that they were both a couple in real life).  There is virtually no chemistry between Portman and Christensen to work with, that it's best just to look away.I have a major problem with Hayden Christensen and Ewan McGregor (Moulin Rouge).  They have disgraced their iconic characters.  If you disagree, watch Episodes IV, V, and VI to see the presence of both Alec Guinness (as Obi-Wan Kenobi) and Darth Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones and brought to life by David Prowse).  How these young versions will evolve into the later ones is a complete mystery to me.  After seeing the movie ask yourself these questions:  Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan?  Christensen as Darth Vader? McGregor seemed more Obi-like in Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace.  His performance here is more annoying.  Since when did Obi-Wan become a smart-ass?  As for Christensen, all I saw was whine whine whine.  I have to admit, he tries very hard, but he is wrong for the part.  I can understand how the movie shows the causes for the beginning of Anakin's fall to the dark side.  All the elements are there.  But his rage, passion, and presence are underwhelming.What truly amazed me is how the non-human characters have more depth than those that are human (not a good sign).  R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) is still the cute reliable and ingenious little robot that we all love.  C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) is still the arrogant chatterbox that he is.  Yes Jar Jar Binks (Ahmed Best) is still annoying, but at least he has a personality (try describing the traits of the human characters).  And Yoda (Frank Oz) is still the wise beloved icon that he is.  I'm glad that they animated him through CGI.  We are finally able to see him move, and in the film's climactic scenes, he becomes involved in an action sequence so unlikely, that is impossible not to smile at (even laugh at) upon seeing it.  He nearly saves the movie.The non-human characters are not the only things more lively than the human actors.  I have to admit that I have never seen better special effects in any movie, than in AOTC.  The visuals are jaw-droppingly rich, detailed, deep, and alive.  The city-chase sequence, the planet where it never stops raining, an alien arena, and the clone war battle scenes will have audiences agape with awe.  I especially liked a space-chase scene between Jango Fett (Temuera Morrison) and Obi-Wan through an asteroid field.  I could not believe the quality of the asteroids, each having their own path and rotation.  And the complexity of their collisions is magnificent.Technically, AOTC is a breakthrough.  It is probably the first film where an entire virtual world has been created with human actors inserted within (as opposed to the opposite which has been the prevailing trend).  The effects flow seamlessly, but sad to say, that doesn't mean they look real.  The more three-dimensional the effects become, the more unconvincing everything seems.  The alien gladiator action has all the impact of a G.I.Joe cartoon. And a sequence involving Anakin and Amidala within an alien assembly line left me feeling empty.  Yes, everything looked in order, but Anakin's movements looked too choreographed, when he's supposed to be avoiding danger.The best episode of the Star Wars series was V: The Empire Strikes Back. Not only was it a visual wonder at the time.  But its plot was completely unpredictable (what a shock it was to find out Darth Vader's secret!).  But AOTC is most of the time predictable.  Most of all, it has no life.  Where is the charming arrogance of Han Solo?  The determination and feistiness of Princess Leia?  The innocence and hope inspired by Luke Skywalker?  The calming wisdom of Ben Kenobi and Yoda?  And the menacing force of Darth Vader?  Where is the style?  The flair?  The joy?  These are what made Star Wars the greatest space-opera ever made.  Sure AOTC looks great, but like A. O. Scott (NYTimes) says, 'So what?'",5,0,1,16 May 2002
American Pie," Good message at the end... but tasteless nonetheless
","This film left a bad taste in my mouth (no pun intended).  It has some great comedic moments, and they are done very well, but most of them are unoriginal.  I'd like to comment on them further, but I would be revealing too much if I did.Despite what most people think, the movie does have a good message for teens at the end.  But it doesn't make up for most of the despicable things that were done during the rest of the film.This movie is very funny, but at what price?  Being tasteless.  Despite getting a laugh out of this one, I wish I never saw it.",6,0,0,6 September 1999
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," The best action movie of the decade...
","This scifi action epic is the standard which all other films of its kind are measured against.  It is to action as 'The Silence of the Lambs' is to suspense.  The movie of course is built around one man, Arnold Schwarzenneger, and is clearly his best movie.  A truly unique and absolutely thrilling movie experience.",8,0,0,25 August 1999
Saving Private Ryan," More than worthy of an Oscar...
","If the Pentagon and the U.S. Army could honor this film, how could this film not be recognized as the best of 1998?  This is more than a movie.  It is an incredible experience and a grim reminder:  of how horrible war can be, and the sacrifices that were made by those who fought for us to be free. Thank you Steven Spielberg for making this film.",10,0,0,25 August 1999
Transformers," A battle between nostalgia and common sense
","In my adolescence, I once thought that THE TRANSFORMERS: THE MOVIE (1986) was one of the best films ever made. Age and access had not yet tinged my movie-going experience. Such is youth, forever sentimentalizing our early lives and its subjects. Many of us who grew up on these Hasbro heroes still hold them in reverie, regardless of the profound silliness of it all. But we've all been young, and boys will be boys in love with their toys.For followers of the series, how much you love Michael Bay's TRANSFORMERS will depend on how much you have grown up (and probably how many decibels your eardrums can take). It seems natural that many of us who collected toy autobots and decepticons might have had great interest in the fields of science, as the mechanics of how these robots transform required inquiry during our younger years. So if you're like me, watching this movie may not only reveal an on screen battle between good and evil, but also one's own personal battle between nostalgia and common sense.I know that I shouldn't be applying logic against a concept that was never meant to be logical. Optimus Prime, Megatron and their ilk were not meant to be opposing leaders of a mechanical alien race set against a space epic. They're cool toys representing the fanciful idea of having normal everyday vehicles transform into humanoid mechas. That's killing two birds with one stone in toy marketing.The problem is that the level of detail and seriousness the film initially builds up begs us to consider its plausibility. The movie's opening sequence of where a decepticon infiltrates a US military base (apparently in the Middle East) is well-executed and as convincing as can be. Explanations on how these mechas are able to speak English are humorous but (barely) believable. And the initial electronic strategies the decepticons use to hamper US defense systems make sense.But when the deeper questions are asked, the house of cards falls apart. These robots transform to blend into earth's general populace, but why did they ever need to transform in the first place? Was there an evolutionary advantage that morphing gave them on their home world or are they just God's toys? Why do they speak to communicate as they are electronic beings? If they can reach the earth through space, why do they travel slowly as grounded transport? Couldn't they all have chosen aircraft functions to replicate? And why in one inexplicable scene are they reduced to comedic stooges hiding from a kid's parents in his backyard? Surely these and other queries are supposed to be ignored, but my inquisitive side keeps on tugging on my id. If your inner child wins out however, there are worthy sights to behold. The transformers themselves have been bravely redesigned, which is refreshingly the correct choice as opposed to keeping their original forms. Though some characters from the cartoon series will be familiar, the vehicular alter-egos have been totally revamped to fit current tastes (and toy franchising needs). Mecha battles engaged in Los Angeles are at times breathtaking, none more than Starscream's low-flying dogfighting maneuvers. Fans will likely warm to some in-jokes (a decepticon police car motto), a jab at 'My Little Pony' (a fellow Hasbro franchise), and surely, hearing Peter Cullen's voicing of Prime.Speaking of which, this gloriously authoritative father-figure lacks presence and warmth. Animated characters by their very nature more stylized and symbolic; highlighting their traits to an almost elemental level. How ironic that Optimus Prime in all his CGI glory projects less heroism and gravitas than his hand-drawn version. Perhaps it is our youth that taints our view, plus the all-to realistic detail of the film's special effects makes him look more of a machine and less of a hero (or maybe it's because now we can see his mouth move?). Shia LaBeouf, as the young Sam Witwicky who stumbles onto the robotic conflict, is the only well-rounded character worth following. He keeps it interesting, but can only do so much.From a cinematic view, Michael Bay was born to direct this movie. He just loves toys, as not one of his films to date has had an unexploded vehicle. In filming convincing human dynamics however, he hasn't got a clue, as evidenced in one scene where he tries miserably and awkwardly in getting us to feel bad for an autobot's capture. His methods have deteriorated as he irritatingly refuses to stop using shaky camera movements during conflict, and dozens of slow motion sequences, mistaking disorientation and distraction for a frenzied perspective. For the life of me, I don't understand why he cannot just let the action speak for itself.As you can see, I've grown up a bit too far from my guilelessness to enjoy TRANSFORMERS. I do not disdain this kind of entertainment. Truth be told, its writing is better than I thought it would be, but its fancy façade can't hide its flaws for those who want more substance. I find Prime deserving of better treatment, but considering its source, this might be as good as it gets. So enjoy it if you can. I tried and couldn't.",5,7,15,1 July 2007
Dumb and Dumber," It may be dumb...
","But this film has very very few peers in making one laugh out loud.  Very few films have been able to make me laugh uncontrollably as did this one. And I never expected to take the movie seriously (Hey!  Look at the title!!).  If you don't laugh in this movie, you're devoid of humor.  It's a high hit with it's low (and I mean low) comedy.I'm still smiling as I think of its sequences.  Go see it!",8,0,0,25 August 1999
2001: A Space Odyssey," Beyond filmmaking...
","Perhaps Roger Ebert said it best... 'Kubrick's goal here is not to thrill us, but to fill us with a sense of awe.'  And no film I have ever seen captures man's universal meaning in a film as does '2001: A Space Odyssey.' From man's beginning to his probable destiny, Kubrick has captured the essential milestones that may have and what could still shape the very essence of humanity.  And he does so very very much with so very little. This film, without computer graphics and hitech special effects, accomplishes more for the science fiction genre, than any other film of its kind, including the Star Wars Trilogy, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and Contact.For me, this is definitely the best motion picture of all time.  ***** out of ****.",10,8,15,25 August 1999
Raging Bull," The 80's best movie...
","A must see.  The greatest movie of the 1980's.  Robert De Niro gives his most memorable performance since Taxi Driver.  How does he do it?  A real tragic story, which is characterized by most of Scorsese's works.  But powerful.  And how many actors would gain 40 lbs. for a role?",10,2,2,17 September 1999
The Silence of the Lambs," Scariest movie of the 90's
","'The Silence of the Lambs' is quite simply... the most suspensful and frightening movie of this decade.  Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) is the most subtly terrifying psychotic movie villain (monster if you like) since Norman Bates.  Though Anthony Hopkins only had a screen time of 45 minutes, his presence was the most powerful of any of his films.  This is truly a scary cinematic masterpiece.",Null,0,0,7 April 1999
The Matrix," Dark City is better...
","All the technical aspects of 'The Matrix' are excellently done.  The energy of this movie absolutely surges through its viewers.  And the concept of how machines utilize human beings is intriguing.  But it seems like a third act is missing.  I desperately wanted to know what would happen if the heroes won, instead of having an open ending which seemed so unfair to the audience.  After carrying the audience through a wonderful ride, 'The Matrix' stops short of delivering a knockout punch.  If you want to see a movie that is just as well done with an incredible ending and similar story line... see Dark City.'The Matrix' could have been so much better... a souped-up version of Dark City... but it is still a visually intoxicating movie with an interesting plot.  It is worth seeing.  But if you've seen Dark City... you might be disappointed.",8,0,0,26 May 1999
Tarzan," As of this writing, the best film of 1999.
","This movie draws a sense of awe throughout the entire story.  Though its plot may be formulaic, it executes better than any other formulaic movie this year.  This is the best animated film  I have seen in the last 5 years since 'The Lion King'.  The images are absolutely wonderful to look at. The music by Phil Collins is so powerful that it energizes the whole movie making you feel emotionally charged all throughout.  I feel this film could have never been made in live action, since it gives a totally new perspective on what Tarzan may actually have been like, his movement, his upbringing, and most of all, his interaction with jungle family.  The musical sequences by the gorillas were silly, but entertaining (it is a Disney film isn't it?).  And Tarzan's movement through the jungle is so spectacular that it makes Aladdin's flying carpet escape from the lamp's abyss seem pale in comparison.Though most of Tarzan's leaping, swinging, and tree surfing seem unrealistic, we have to keep in mind that this is an animated film, and since it is Disney's, thrills will be expected.  Tarzan delivers exciting thrills, fills you with awe through the entire film, without sacrificing the story and the underlying theme.  This is a WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL FILM.  Go see it.If you have to decide between Star Wars I and Tarzan, it's no contest... Tarzan is the film Star Wars I should have been.",8,26,39,11 July 1999
