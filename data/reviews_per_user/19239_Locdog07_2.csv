The Blair Witch Project," Brilliant and much more than meets the eye
","A lot of people who do badmouth this film haven't done any real research into the movie's background. It's just not enough to watch the movie in a theather and blocking your mind off from whatever happens on the screen so you can walk out and say 'That wasn't scary'. The whole point of the film is to be scared, it's a horror, so why not let it happen? A lot of these people might have actually been scared but not realized it. But I'm speculating.The film itself is incredible, a work of genius. It's inspired so many people to argue and debate over what actually happened to these three students, even though by now we all know it was fake. Those people who say 'It's dumb cause it wasn't real', are they actually saying they wanted to see three students hunted down a probably murdered? So much effort went into making this film possible, some of which even came from the fans themself before the film was even released. I've done a lot of research into the film's background and secrets that I can't help but love it, and there are so many people who limit themselves to simply watching the film with a stone mind and not letting any of the imagination the movie creates seep into their brain.My second favorite film of all time, it will always be a classic to me.

Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Brilliant Installment
","I went to see this film after having been told by many other viewers of the film that either the movie is amazing, or totally the opposite. I knew exactly what was to happen, having read the book, seen spoiler after spoiler on the internet, and basically having been told by other fans. Therefore, I expected to be disappointed. I was not.Special effects wise, the movie couldn't have been better. I think the pod race and the light-saber duel at the end will go down in history as some of the greatest moments in history. The acting, apart from maybe Jake Lloyd (Who I can forgive), was better than I had expected since Lucas hasn't directed for over 20 years. Neeson was brilliant, and McGregor portrayed Kenobi better than most other actors could have. Portman was really great, and I can see her going on to do much in her career no matter what she chooses to pursue. But perhaps my favorite performance in the movie had to be Ian McDiarmid as Senator Palpatine. A very dazzling, wonderful installment to the Star Wars saga, I give it a 10 out of 10.",10,0,0,17 July 1999
