The Blair Witch Project," Excellent horror film, great acting, awesome ending.
","A very stylish, original and exciting movie, one of the best horror films ever made. Performances by the young actors Donahue, Williams and Leonard are pretty believable. This movie is already a modern day classic and will stand from the rest horror films in concept and context. The idea of making a movie of this type and all the buzz it created on the Internet was good. There were some people who actually believe that the events in the movie took place. In the end, Blair Witch was a cool concept, not only in horror, but in the film industry in general... taking its root back to the 80s controversial Cannibal Holocaust in its way of marketing the film.",8,1,1,8 September 1999
The Ring," Total Disappointment
","The Ring was a total disappointment.  It's amazing how most of the comments indicate that this is a very scary film.  I think not.  The movie lacks so many factors to be consider a great horror film.  It is so predictable, it uses the same theme other movies have used to uncover the death of someone. It's been done, it's pointless, it's not so creative.  There are only 3 good points to this film: 1)The atmosphere:  the forest, the cabins, the island, the barn.  2)The tape is pretty creepy (the first time only).   3)Samara coming out of the TV, that was great! and the only scene worthy to be consider horror.
To all those viewers that consider this the scariest movie of all time I recommend the following movies, to be watched at night, alone preferably: The Evil Dead, The Shining, Suspiria, The House by the Cemetery, just to mention a few.  These are jewels in the horror genre, you wont be disappointed.",Null,0,0,5 November 2002
Hot Fuzz," Hot Fuzz: A film review
","Hot Fuzz explores the sides of dark comedies like no other film. It is a combination of wit, action, horror, violence and blood. It is a simple movie, but executed in a way that no other has been done. It captures the essence of the English country side and the performances by Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are excellent, as usual.Many compare this to Shaun of the Dead and say that this is even a better film, but I disagree. I think both are excellent films and cannot be compared because they are different genres. Shaun combines comedy with horror, but horror is its main genre. Fuzz combines comedy with action and violence, but action is its main genre. Anyways, both films are awesome.The action scenes in Hof Fuzz are very enjoyable to watch. The script is smart and witty. The little tones of horror are great and unexpected! Let's hope that these trio continues to make awesome films such as the Shaun 'odyssey' and Hot Fuzz.",10,0,1,28 September 2007
The Others," Interesting Ghost Film
","This story develops inside a mansion; it's set in England in the 19th century.  It starts off somewhat slow, but still it has the ability to grab the attention of the audience as the plot develops.  Since the start of the movie, the tension is present and as the story expands the tension grows and becomes omniscient in the film, transmitting the message to the audience.  It's an original ghost story.  It also has the elements for a good horror film: the silence, the fog, the darkness, the house, , the doors, the trees, the pond, the cold, the elderly, the madness, the children, the graves, and the most morbid photographs.  The director combined all these elements into a tasteful dish of the macabre!The Others is an interesting and intelligent ghost film.  In the horror genre, ghost stories masterfully created are amazing because they are creepy and many times send the audience the full effect that only the beautiful genre, that is HORROR, can transmit.* * * * *",Null,0,0,7 November 2001
Snatch," Bullets, Great Acting, Laughs, Bullets and More Bullets...
","Snatch is just a great film.  From the opening to the closing.  Its got edge, it's all edge!  The characters are cool and the acting is just splendid.  Brad Pitt as the pikey, in one of his best performances. The fact that there are so many characters in the film and that somehow they are all connected through one huge diamond makes this movie unique.  I know this has been done before in many films; such as Pulp Fiction, Magnolia or Amores Perros,amongst others, but the way Snatch is told is what makes it extremely enjoyable and the audience can just savor the dialogues, the camera work and even the one liners!  Which give the film part of its edge. I guess a writer and director must know that one liners can be truly funny or truly devastating in a film.  In this case Guy Ritchie had the right actor, the right scene and the right one liner to elevate the potential of this awesome film. ***** 5 stars",10,0,1,20 November 2002
Pan's Labyrinth," Fantastic
","El Laberinto del Fauno is a true tale of fantasy and imagery. It mixes the fantasy world of a small girl and the cruelty of the war in a very subtle manner. This film captures all the magical elements in a fairy tale and it is presented in an exquisite and elegant manner by Guillermo del Toro, which I might add is the greatest Mexican filmmaker today.I do not recall any other Mexican films that deal with the fantasy/horror genre like this one does. As a matter of fact, most Mexican films are always trying to be controversial by using sexual scenes and bad language and also by showing us the corruption, politics and poverty of Mexico.El Laberinto del Fauno does none of the above. This film is just pure pleasure to the eyesight and the rest of the senses. It is a magical tale for adults and it is a delight to see the imagination and originality of the best Mexican filmmaker.",10,4,9,24 January 2007
Final Destination 2," Waste of Time
","I can only say that this film is a total waste of time and an insult to the Horror Genre.   It is so unrealistic that I even found it funny to  certain points.  The deaths are so fake and exaggerated.  The characters are lame and empty; nonetheless the actors, specially the state trooper... he beat everyone as the worst actor.Anyway, the film lacks credibility, the way the people die is just not realistic:  pigeons, hooks, wires, stairs, trees?  Besides all these nonsense, the dialogue is very hollow and absurd.  What's even funnier is the way how everything fits into place and everything is so obvious to every character.  The gore in the film is not even that cool and the ending could definitely be ranked as one of the stupidiest endings in a horror film.  I know that it is only a film and it is only to entertain the audience, well I was entertained, but in a humoristic way.I do not recommend this film to horror-buffs.  Instead keep it old school with 70's and early 80's classics.  Many good horror films were done during parts of these 2 decades.  Check out something done by Italian director Dario Argento, you will not be disappointed...",Null,0,0,6 August 2003
The Orphanage," A Brilliant and Stylish Horror Film
","In a few short and simple words, El Orfanato is a disturbing, frightening and very eerie film... It's a simple movie with strong character development, excellent acting, a very creepy atmosphere and a very well executed story with an intelligent script. All the actors in the film give outstanding performances and every scene is done magnificently.There are many horror films in the world being made nowadays, not sure how many, but it must be a number somewhere in the thousands per year, but a very high percentage of those films are garbage. Bad scripts, bad acting, bad ideas, movies stealing from other movies and the worst Japanese remakes.Where any other movie fails, El Orfanato emerges victoriously. I have stated this before in some of my other reviews: 'Horror is a genre that needs to be handled with care' because If it is overdone, then it falls into ridicule. If it is too light, then it is not scary. If it is too gory then, it is too graphic and most critics kill it, and this list goes on and onEl Orfanato does none of the above; it stays loyal to the genre and does it with elegance and style. There are no monsters, no creatures, no gore, no torture, and no grotesque scenes. No need for any of these, with such a brilliant script, musical score and direction. The film grabs the audience from start to finish.Highly recommended. A+",10,2,6,19 February 2008
Van Helsing," Boring and Disappointing
","After viewing the trailer some months ago I thought this was going to be a good film.  I am completely aware of all the trash that the big studios produce nowadays... somehow I thought this would be different, but instead it turned into a boring film with obnoxious one-liners and too much CGI. 
Now, the actor that played Dracula just didn't fit.  Dracula is suppose to be a dark-powerful being and inspire fear and respect, as well as sex appeal.  Even with all the CGI this Dracula did none of the above.
Dr. Jekill/Mr. Hyde also seemed to be extra, it could have been a deleted scene.CGI is another factor that bothered me.  It's good to have special effects in films, but when it's overdone it looses the effect.  Whatever happened to the make-up department?   In the old days there were films that portrayed vampires, zombies or other evil entities simply with make-up effects; some looked fake and stupid, but others were truly terrifying.I suggest to any serious film enthusiast to stay away from Van Helsing.  If you still want to watch it, do it only for fun.  Just don't expect too much.",6,0,0,10 May 2004
Spider-Man," The Amazing Spider-Man: 20 Years Later!
","I have been a fan of Spider-Man since I was in grade school.  I devoured all those comics one after another.  My whole world revolved around my favorite superhero.  I'd watch the cartoons every Saturday, and as time went by I wonder how come nobody ever did a Spider-Man movie?  Well, 20 years later my expectations have been met.  This film meets all what a Spider-Man fan could ask for. Director Sam Raimi, Stan Lee and all the people that worked together to bring this comic to life really worked hard to accomplish this task.I had a smile in my face as I watched Spidey swing and bounce through the buildings.  The way he moved arms and legs, his yells as he hold to the spider-web, the way he sat on top of the buildings, even when he grabbed to the flag pole, it was as if I was living the comic again!  All his moves were so well coordinated to resemble the comic book.  Even when the cops want to catch him and Jameson hating him...it is all part of the comic...that is what Spider-Man is: a misunderstood hero.The ending is just great, not what many people would have want or the typical Hollywood ending.  But again is just what Spider-Man is, it is what he has, it is what he feels.The rest of the characters were also very good: The Goblin, Mary Jane, Aunt May and Uncle Ben and the petulant, complaining, ambitious J.J. Jameson. For those not familiar with the comic my lines probably don't make any sense, but for the Spidey-Fan.... well you know exactly what I mean.Great Film *****",Null,0,0,6 May 2002
Resident Evil," Not a true HORROR film, but still entertaining
","Personally, Resident Evil caused me somewhat of a disappointment.  Being that I am a fan of horror and consider myself to be a connoisseur in the genre, I went to the movie theatre with the idea that I was going to see real zombies; such as those in George Romero's trilogy or Lucio Fulci's Zombi 2, even like those in the classic B movie Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things.  But it was nothing like that.  On the contrary, the zombies in Resident Evil looked stupid and not scary at all.  What happened to the classic zombie moans and humming?  The facial close-ups?  The gore? The explicit zombie attacks? The loud bites and zombie appetite?  And the list can go on just to compare what a classic zombie movie should be versus the new zombies such as the ones portrayed in Resident Evil where even some of the zombies faces were computer generated.
It seems like good horror films will not make a come back to the big screen. There have been many, such as Scream, Urban Legend, I Know what you did Last Summer, Disturbing Behavior, Jeepers Creepers and so many more recent films, but none are true to the genre.  There will probably never be another Suspiria, Evil Dead, Inferno, Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Phenomena among others.Now taking Resident Evil from a different point of view: it is an OK Hollywood movie, entertaining and very similar to the video game (T-virus, killer Dobermans, Train, Licker, Umbrella).  Milla Jovovich beauty enlightens the screen and her performance is pretty good.  Overall the film is watchable, not the greatest but still entertaining.",Null,0,0,20 March 2002
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," 'With my last breath...'
","This is a film about martial arts, fantasy, drama and romance.  It is magnificent in every aspect.  The acting is great, the story is excellent and the scenery is beautiful.  This film contains very profound and powerful scenes; breath-taking lines and dialogue. It does not follow a repetitive plot, it does not try to be another film, it is original in all proportions.  Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a great film from start to finish. It captured every minute of my attention and the ending was just marvelous.  It should definitely be a serious academy award contender.",Null,0,0,6 February 2001
The Evil Dead," Once you've experienced The Evil Dead, your idea of horror films will change forever...
","I saw this movie 10 years ago for the 1st time and it scared me. I saw it again the year after that and it had the same effect. Time went by and I decided to experience it one more time, the movie had the same effect. The Evil Dead is unique in its kind, there are other horror movies one watches one time and are scary, but the second time are not. Evil Dead never loses its magic, this movie will make your hands sweaty, the music will make you nervous, and the demonic laughter will make you want to turn of your TV. Evil Dead is the best horror film, ever made. Yes, there are others like The Exorcist or Rosemary's Baby that are all frightful movies. But Evil Dead is much better than those. The scene at the end, when Bruce Campbell is walking around the cabin all covered in blood is exquisite. He walks around scared, and while he's walking the music is slowly fading until it reaches total silence. Here's where the audience knows something is going to happen and it is just great when the two arms brake the front door and grab him from the back. Also the camera work is extraordinary. I recommend this movie to anyone wishing to watch an excellent horror movie.",10,0,0,8 September 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," A mixture of suspense and eroticism
","Good movie, very sexy and spooky at the same time.  Wonderfully directed, good music, even though it is too monotonous it is very effective and frightening.  Many people didn't like, many people said it didn't have a plot- not true-  the film is another masterpiece created by S. Kubrick, watch it and experience it yourselves.",Null,0,0,9 September 1999
Rosemary's Baby," Truly Creepy and Demonic
","This is definitely one of the best horror films ever made.  The conspiracy that Rosemary goes throughout the film is truly creepy.  What makes it so scary is that she goes trusting her husband and 'friends' without any idea of what really is happening to her.  The rape scene is horrifying, very intense and at its best for the horror genre.  'Rosemary's Baby' is a great horror film, there are no posessions, no gore, but the film is intense in content.  It has power to make the audience nervous, tense and very scared. -********** A perfect 10.",Null,97,135,11 June 2000
30 Days of Night," 30 Days of Night: A Film Review
","30 Days of Night is a film that delivers a few scary moments, creepy looking predator-vampires and nothing else more. There is no story or no answers as to Who are the vampires? Where do they come from? What do they want? besides the obvious... Who is the creepy looking man in the opening scene of the movie who later gets thrown in jail?These and much more questions are left unexplained through the movie. Perhaps one needs to read the comics first to understand the film? My opinion is that they could have done so much better, being that idea of filming in Alaska in darkness is great... the filmmakers could have done more character development and a decent story.Gore, creepiness and violence were up to level for today's horror standards; as well as make up and costumes... Like I said the setting and idea were great, but if a story would have been developed, this film could have become a vampire favorite, not just one of many attempts to make modern horror movies.Too bad...",3,2,9,5 November 2007
1408," 1408 lacks horror, suspense, creepiness... and by no means should be compared to The Shining!!!
","There are way too many positive comments about this movie. Hundreds of users praise this movie as being true horror and there are some that have the indecency to compare it to Kubrick's masterpiece The Shining. This is all wrong... 1408 is just another Stephen King story, there is nothing special about it... no horror, no suspense, not one single moment of creepiness. Cusak gives an OK performance, but the director does not manage to create an unsettling atmosphere for the story. 1408 is not a horror movie and the PG-13 rating does not help at all. It is difficult to create an effective horror story nowadays, especially to a generation that either gets scared on teen slasher films or the opposite, grizzly violence and torture films. 1408 does none of the above, but tries to explore supernatural phenomena failing undoubtedly. It takes more than computer generated ghostly images and a sense of madness to develop an effective horror film. For example, Dario Argento, captured the essence of the supernatural in his films Suspirira and Inferno. But one does not have to go back to the 70s or 80s to find good horror movies... some recent great horror: House of 1000 Corpses, Dog Soldiers, Cabin Fever, Hostel, May, 28 Days Later.1408 delivers nothing special for the passionate horror connoisseur.",2,14,29,10 July 2007
