Captain Phillips," A disappointment but not for what you think
","Spoiler alert included. That any ship, cargo or what have you, would go to sea knowing pirates are out there, especially in that part of the ocean, without sufficient training, proper equipment and weaponry is unbelievable in this day and age. With our technology this incident should not have happened. I applaud the actors and director, especially Tom Hanks and in particular the inexperienced Somali actors who gave a realistic chilling performance! It is a story well told; however, the premise - apparently based on an actual occurrence - is a blow to my intelligence. Trying to fake radio assistance? Hoses as a deterrent? Seriously? Of course I don't claim to be an expert on maritime law but perhaps it's time to revise it to include sufficient means to prevent this type of piracy from happening. From my view it was completely unnecessary. (Kudos to the real Captain Phillips. He apparently did the best with what he had - precious little.)",4,1,1,17 March 2016
