First Man," Seems my friends & I are only ones who didn't get this movie?
","Normally love all things space/NASA but this was just too drawn out, too dull. There wasn't a single character that was interesting , that lite up the screen.. all pretty drab. Unfortunately there was no banter amongst the characters.. There was lots of long pauses and 'dead air'. We were disappointed after the rave reviews the movie received.",4,2,4,29 October 2018
