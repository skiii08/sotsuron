Miracle," PHIL VERCHOTA AND MIKE ERUZIONE
","They really need to be in the movie more. Mike Eruzione, because he's cute, and Phil Verchota.....well......only because my dad works with him at the bank. Phil is huge, but he is so cool. He was the guy that was checking out the blondes in section 2 during the movie. And Mike Eruzione..... Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! You have to agree, Mike (Patrick O'Brian Demsey) should have been in there more. He was such a good actor, too. I also hoped to see more of Jim Craig, because he seemed to be the sports freak type. But then again, so am I, at least when it comes to the University of North Dakota hockey team.  And if anyone from the real 1980 team or whoever played them in the movie is reading this..... I LOVE YOU!",Null,0,0,28 February 2004
