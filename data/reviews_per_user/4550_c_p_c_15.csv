The Ring," One Videotape I Want To Own!!!
","I have to say that I am a big fan of horror movies and when such a movie comes along that is done right, it gets really exciting.  THE RING is a great thriller that really gets your blood pumping.  Each scene is one suspense master after the next.A great thing about this movie is the fact that there is actually some thought in it.  The plot advances as the film goes, which is usually unlikely in horror movies and to my surprise this film did not base its scares on gore (for the most part).I have heard some people compare this movie to this years earlier release FEARDOTCOM.  This movie is nothing like FEARDOTCOM and to compare it to such a horribly made movie is an insult.  THE RING takes the audience and while proving to be an effectively scary movie, it really keeps you interested from start to finish.My only complaint about this movie is that there are a lot of questions that were never answered, or things that just did not make sense.  The movie ends with a great compilation scene however, you realize that there are a lot of holes that did not fill.  Although, it did make for great discussion on the way home.This movie will definitely be on my to buy list and is quite worth the price of admissionA great horror flick but because of the unanswered points to the movie I give THE RING a 8/10",8,0,0,19 November 2002
Dawn of the Dead," The Sun's Up Here!!!
","This year seems to be the Year of the Horror Movie Remake.  Beginning with TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE back in October, and now with DAWN OF THE DEAD, many can only imagine what other concepts are being thought up.However, if any future remake has the stamina that this remake has, then the horror genre may revive itself.  DAWN OF THE DEAD is in no sense a breakthrough movie with an inventive plot.  Actually we never learn of the reason zombies exist in the first place (it is a remake of the follow up of NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, where the plot is revealed).  But it is the excitement and relentlessness that this film brings about it.From the fun and intense opening to the finale (which is a little predictable, I should add I have never seen the original all the way through), there is always something going on.The actors in this film, while several of them have names (particularly Ving Rhames and Mekhi Pheifer), are all decent in the parts they play.  They each offer something different to the movie.The message of consumerism that spawned from the first one is still used here, but not does not remain a main focus.For having a great sense of style, some intense scenes, and overall fun DAWN OF THE DEAD (2004) rates as a  6/10.",6,0,0,31 March 2004
The Others," A Movie Worth Seeing
","Creepy, spine-tingling, twisting, etc...these words plus many more could describe the nature of this film.  Set in an erie, remote house, this film uses psychology to thrill as opposed to blood and gore.  It uses the thoughts on what happens when you die and plays around with them, ultimately delivering a very pleasing film.  While in my opinion it took a little to long to get started, the scary enviroment, jump-scenes (not to many but when they occur, watch out), and the overall ending was worth the time spent.Overall, if you are looking for a suspenseful and respectable (not to often do you see those two words together when talking about a horror film) thriller, this is a good bet.  Creepy and crazy, when this movie is over you will be thinking about it for hours.7/10 - Points were subtracted for the while it took to get started (in my opinion the makers took to long to set the background), plus they needed a few more jump scenes.",7,0,0,25 February 2002
Final Destination 2," A 'Bloody' Good Time
","First off, to enjoy this movie you have to take it for face value.  It is not attempting to be like THE RING or anything of that matter.  This movie is clearly made so the audience can watch people die in crazy ways (I know its a little twisted).  It really in a way is a comedic/horror picture.Unlike its predecessor, this movie realized the farfetched plot and runs with it.  The first one was good, but it took its topic to seriously.  The deaths are overly creative and drawn out to great legths in some cases, all given for shock value.  Before long the audience finds itself, 'I wonder how the next person is going to die?'  It brings about a lot of fun anticipation.  This sequel is good in part due to the fact that is doesn't have much to live up to, I mean the first movie was about the same thing, except in the sequel 'Death' becomes a little more creative. 
The acting talent is none to remember, but that is what makes it fun is the fact that you don't care to much about the characters as they get picked off.  The movie does throw a few plot twists in the mix just to make things more interesting, and it works.Beware, this movie isn't for those with weak stomachs.  Along with the elaborate death scenes comes a very elaborate amount of blood.  Clearly the filmakers were hoping to win on shock value, and in this case they do.  The opening crash sequence is like none I have seen before.  IT is absolutely amazing and becomes very intense.This movie is fun.  It is in no way a movie that will go down on the top 10 horror movies of all time, but for what the filmakers were trying to achieve, they did a great job.For a great 'bloody' time at the movies, I give FINAL DESTINATIOn 2 a 7/10.",7,0,0,17 February 2003
Wanted," Not a bit of substance...but, who cares?
","Putting it bluntly, 'WANTED' was a rather formulaic and predictable outing. A loserly, office shut-in with the help of a hot babe learns about his past and is suddenly thrust into the world of assassination, a world of flipping cars, extreme gun fights, and mind-altering stunts, thus shedding every bit of his shy, weak self. This we've all seen before.Where 'WANTED' stands apart from any other action film I've seen is in its style. The director has upped the ante on how the action is portrayed. Gone are any sort of boundaries. This is a world where people can flawlessly flip cars over others and land perfectly upright on the other side, where people can shoot from miles away hitting nothing but their target, where people can put such a curve on bullets that they hit multiple targets standing on different planes all with one shot. If people can really do this, perhaps I'm living the same existence as Wesley, and I'm missing out. The film's major selling point is its style and its worth a viewing simply for that.The A-List cast delivers solid performances, but the script they are given - with the exception of the last line uttered in the film - is mostly generic. James McAvoy is sympathetic and relatable as the guy who is overwhelmingly bored with his life but doesn't know how to change it - something many people understand. His transformation into tough guy is effortless and convincing. Angelina Jolie is Fox - a name quite fitting as Jolie looks fantastic; however, we've seen this character on her before. Still, she does it well. Freeman, as usual, injects intelligence into his role, playing the solemn leader of The Fraternity.However, for all the edgy extreme events the film contains, the film is hurt by some pieces that are just plain odd and are never fully explained. For one, The Fraternity gets their targets from a secret code that is woven into tapestries by The Loom of Fate. Sounding like something from a Monty Python sketch, it is never revealed who - if anyone - controls the loom or where it derives its powers. Names are simply revealed through code and the members of The Fraternity don't ask questions. The members of The Fraternity are fully human, but seemingly invincible thanks to some sort of special wax bath devised to heal wounds very quickly. It's the film's easy out that allows them to deliver the goods on all the high-octane action they desire. Lastly, the film turns a very predictable corner that many will see coming from miles away.When the film ends you will realize how simple it is and how ridiculous it is about 75% of the time, but you won't care. The film makes up for every flaw by smearing the screen with mind-bending stunts, unique filmography, and breathtaking visuals - yes, Ms. Jolie is one of them. It will be painfully obvious that all the simple plot details were just the framework and the real substance of the film lies not in its intricate story, but in the execution of its stunts and action. 7/10.",7,93,156,8 December 2008
Spider-Man," This could be the start of a great line of summer movies for 2002
","This movie has everything going for it, a great and loved hero, an all star cast (any movie with Kirsten Dunst can't be all that bad, awesome visual effects, and a great appeal. Everything in this movie seemed so real, and I don't mean Toby Maguire climbing up walls, I mean the action and the fight scenes were incredible. The visual effects in this movie will send you for a major ride.I think this movie could be a great start to a summer of good releases. The acting is good, the characters are believable, they make spider-man look really cool, and after seeing it you will want to swing through the buildings in your city.However, there is one thing in the end that bothered many people. I won't say what it is for the sake of not giving anything away, but if they changed it the movie would be perfect.Because the entire 2 hours before the ending were absolutely awesome I give Spider-man a 7/10.",10,0,0,6 May 2002
Meet the Fockers," Charming, but you could play Battleship with all the hits and misses in this film
","MEET THE PARENTS had to be one of the top comedies of 2000. Now, four years later the tables have turned as we 'meet the Fockers.' The humor has lowered a bit as we mostly are thrown sex joke after sex joke; however, the film is still enjoyable.Sequels like this only work if you liked the first round. Anyone who didn't like PARENTS will not find this endeavor any more appealing; however, fans of the original will most likely enjoy this offering.DeNiro is still the hard and ultra-serious character who does not find the Focker's particularly amusing. Stiller once again tries to impress Jack, but his immature plans only backfire. Danner is again funny as Pam's spacey mother who follows Jack but wishes he would lighten up. Polo is always present, but not as utilized as she was in the original. It's the addition of Hoffman and Streisand that give this film the charm it needs to stay afloat. The on screen energy the two show is addicting and it's great to see two people who really do love each other and are not afraid to show it, albeit, somewhat inappropriately at times. They are where the fun is at.FOCKERS at times tries a little too hard to be funny and at others hits the nail right on the head. For the most part the film balances hits and misses and does not disappoint, although this is definitely not the original. However, it is great to see these two spectrum end different families collide and come together.Overall, a charming effort, but one that will always live in the shadows of its predecessor, MEET THE FOCKERS rates a 6/10.",6,1,3,22 January 2005
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," A decent sequel to a hard to beat original
","There is one thing that Hollywood does to screw itself up, and that is to create a movie that they know will generate sequels, but they make the original too good that it will make the sequels look bad.  Such is the case with The Lost World, it had a lot to uphold to.Although this film is not a total disaster, not in the least, it is very entertaining, it does fall into some of the sequel faults.  Such as trying to be more extreme than the first (bringing the monsters to mainland, and more detailed chase and kill scenes).Although I was not expecting near to the brilliance as the first, and you can't expect that, I thought it this movie would support the first one better than it did.Although not as good as the first, this movie does entertain and is likeable and thus rates a 6/10.",6,1,1,5 October 2002
8 Mile," Not the Milestone It Was Said to Be...
","Granted, this movie was not horrible and I was surprised to see that Eminem could actually act.  While watching this movie I was entertained and did actually care about the characters.  It was when the movie ended I became indifferent about it.For about a week and a half before the movie released in theaters, movie critics from all over were hailing this film and giving out accolades like water in a marathon.  Because of all this I went to this movie with relatively high expectations and they were not met.  Sure the movie is entertaining for the 2 hours it runs and it does have some neat rap/flow scenes, but in the end I did not really see the point the movie was trying to stress.  For the type of movie it is it left you hanging and wondering about it too much.  It seems as if the film makers wanted to make this film as real as possible (which they successfully did) that they forgot the reason that they were making the movie.Now, I did enjoy the movie for the most part, but I kept waiting for something to happen that would turn the plot and it never did.  It is not a movie I would watch again nor would I recommend it (the audience who will appreciate it for what it is worth is a definite younger audience).Because the movie kept me decently entertained but really put out no substance I give 8 MILE a 6/10.",6,0,1,19 November 2002
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Burton cooks up a winner
","I was never doubtful of Burton's capability to pull together this movie. The book's satirical and playful twistedness fits right into Burton's M.O. It is quite evident that Burton had a vision is his mind for this film and for the most part he delivers a fun and satisfying film that serves for great escapism, even though we have seen most of the content before in the original.While we've heard the story before and know exactly what happens to each character, it is still fun to get a tour of Wonka's factory through Burton's vision. The set crew has crafted some visually astounding sets from the Bucket's home to the colorful factory. Scenes that we will recall from the original, such as the boat ride, are more fun and exciting to watch. The original was very solemn, but here things are pretty fast paced.With the exception of Depp playing Wonka, all the actors/actresses are duplicating the roles of the characters in the original. Each child plays up their signature bad character trait and Freddie Highmore is perfect as Charlie. Helena Bonham Carter is always a delight in Burton's films and does well here as Charlie's mother. It is Depp's performance that is significantly different from his counterpart. I consider Depp to be one of the best character actors in Hollywood at this time. He adapts well and commits to his characters. However, I found his Wonka at times a bit off. Depp opted to go for the same sarcastic oddity we found with Wilder's Wonka, but he also decided to be more childish and 'punky' for a lack of better terms. His character is humorous for a bit, but the act gets old after a while. Nevertheless, it by no means ruins the movie and some people will probably really like the character.Thankfully, the lamentful singing is replaced by the eccentric Oompa Loompa musical numbers. Each number is different and completely funny to watch.Lastly, what is also fun about this film is that you can see glimpses of Burton's other films on display here. The opening credits, which consist of a tour through Wonka's odd chocolate bar assembly line reminded me a lot of the cookie maker machine in EDWARD SCISSORHANDS. Also, the Bucket's house looks like it was directly lifted out of BIG FISH with its odd slant. Just a few things Burton added in to bring together his style.In the end, CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY's plot is reused from the original, but what else did you expect. A few things have been changed to follow more closely to the book. While Depp's performance is somewhat off, it certainly is not disastrous to the film in any way. The film is fun, colorful and entertaining. I give it a 7/10.",7,3,7,16 July 2005
Grindhouse," Two parts amazing, One part lame
","Moviegoers are always looking for something different--especially in an age of remakes and sequels--and when it came out that Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarrantino were working together on a throw-back double feature which would capture the feeling of grindhouse cinema people were curious, especially fans of the two directors.Although it will be considered a flop and future projects of this type may be put on hold or axed, 'Grindhouse' starts strong with tons of attitude but seems to come to a dead stop about two-thirds the way through.The film's opener, 'Planet Terror' is by far the superior film. It's a simple horror film that has an abundance of atmosphere, multi-dimensional characters and a quick, thrilling pace. Everything is over-the-top, but it's in this completely gritty and unrealistic world that's where all the fun lies. It plays with the audience's expectations and delivers an experience that demands attention.An unusual but welcomed addition to the film is the inclusion of faux film trailers. Each trailer mocks a convention of the horror genre with hilarious and, often, repulsing results. Some are a bit self-indulgent, but in the context of the film do add to the grindhouse motif.It is Tarantino's submission, 'Death Proof' that brings the film to a dead halt. Tarantino has become far too comfortable in his own success and is at the point where he feels he can do no wrong. This film proves otherwise. From start to finish, 'Death Proof' is a bore, lacking the flavorful dialogue and witty situations Tarantino's films usually contain. We are given about 15 minutes of senseless car chasing to combat the 45 minutes of girl talk, which might have well been written by a sorority girl. It doesn't help his film that it also follows about 2 hours of in-your-face action and violence. Tarantino should have rethought his portion of the film.For whatever reason 'Grindhouse' as a whole flopped (its not wholly Tarantino's film). Perhaps it was the Good Friday release or the fact that a good portion of the film's targeted audience is too young to buy a ticket to an Rated R film on their own or that the generation that once enjoyed these romps has grown out of it. However, this film, or at least the first two hours are entirely entertaining. You may choose to watch Tarantino's effort, but Rodriguez's film as well as the off-the-wall trailers are complete enough to enjoy on their own. It's a shame that something this different didn't do well, as it will discourage future attempts.As it stands, 'Grindhouse' rates a 7 out of 10.",7,8,14,26 April 2007
Scream 2," Another Round of all the Screams!!!
","It is hard to avoid the fact that Scream 2 is a lot like the first one, same plot line, different setting, victims, and of course killers.That being said, this is not a bad movie.  If you enjoyed the first one, you will like this one just as well.  The body count is a little higher in this movie and of course everything is a little drawn out,as sequels tend to do. However, the clever acting, dialogue, and scary scenes are all still there. Craven and his team deserve a little respect for making a decent addition to the horror genre and not screwing up what the original SCREAM had going.A little more exaggerated, but still filled with plenty of screams, SCREAM 2 rates a 6/10",6,0,0,23 April 2003
Bring It On," Entertaining, but no masterpiece!
","This movie, as anyone could expect from a teen film, is mediocre.  It does it's job to entertain, while trying to put some form of plot line/twist into the movie, however, they should have just left it with the cheerleading competition and not the cheating factor.It is a fun movie to watch, and it is one of those movies that you can watch over and over again and still be amused.Overall I give it a 6/10",6,0,0,23 February 2002
Scream," Pure fun!!!
","I love scary movies!  They are absolutely the most fun to watch!  However, the genre seems to be cursed in that it is very hard to put out a decent horror film.  Scream has done it!!!Creatively done, a mix of humor and scare, Scream is fun from start to finish.  What makes it even better is that this film does not derive its scares from blood and gore (although there is a fair amount of it, especially in the opening scene), but it truly does have you in suspense in many of the scenes.  What also adds to this benefit is that the film actually has a plot aside from the slashing that tends to dominate these films.  Because of that this film is a whole lot more interesting and captivating.  The slashing almost becomes a side part, but still offers a lot of fun to the movie.So for great scares and a whole lot of fun, Scream rates a 7/10",7,0,0,26 October 2002
Jurassic Park," One great amusement!
","Jurassic Park had its credit due when it was discovered that Steven Spielberg was directing it.  The sheer brilliance and fun of this film is incredible.  Filled with colorful and realistic looking dinosaurs, this movie is one event after another.  This movie literally keeps you on the edge of your seat.  The action sequences are great and intense and there are quite a lot of them.  This film is a masterpiece surely to not die anytime soon.Wonderful filmaking and another achievement by Spielberg, 8/10",8,1,2,5 October 2002
