First Man," Slow, Boring, and Predictible
","I had high expectations for this movie. Afterall, it is about moon landing. The story however focuses too much on the family life on Neil Armstrong, played by an emotionless, boring, and cold Ryan Gosling. He looked annoyed and unhappy throughout the movie, even after returning to earth and seeing his wife. He actually makes you dislike Neil Armstrong. What a disappointing movie!",5,12,19,19 February 2019
A Star Is Born," Predictible, Cliché, and Redundant
","I had not seen any of the 'A Star is Born' movies before. This was my first, and yet, it felt I have seen this story over and over. I like Bradley Cooper a lot, but his movie was so cliché and predictable. Their love, their fight, her glory and his misery, all of them were expected and they all happened. Sam Elliott's role was plain and added no value to the story.",5,1,4,19 February 2019
The Irishman," A true masterpiece of the past 10 years
","I watched The Irishman twice this week. The first time was in a movie theater and the second time on Netflix. After I watched it the first time, I found it a good movie which was a bit too long and slow and it did not match the quality of Good Fellas or Casino for me. But then I watched it for a second time....I watched it for the second time at home, alone and with subtitles on; and I enjoyed it on a whole different level. I was able to understand what the right way to watch this movie is. This is not an action movie where the actors are explosive and fiery. This is a movie where conversations are extremely important. You need to pay attention to what the actors say to each other, or what the narrator says. Another element that really stood out on the second viewing was the music. It is subtle, but present in most scenes and it is so amazing. This is undoubtedly one of the movies which will be talked about in years to come.If you decide to watch this movie, do yourself a favor: put your phone away and dedicate 3 hours of your focus to this movie and let it entertain you slowly but surely.",10,6,14,29 November 2019
