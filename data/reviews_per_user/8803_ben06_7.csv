Mission: Impossible III," Great, if you don't have a brain...
","Typically what to expect from a mission impossible film. boringly predictable with no story, just a bunch of amazing special effects and explosions and crap jokes. Nothing bad about that if you want to sit back and watch that kind of thing. The issue is its the same thing over and over which film makers are likely to cash in on for years to come. Can't wait for MI15 to come out!",3,0,2,20 September 2019
Dead Poets Society," Was expecting better after the hyped reviews.
","I had heard this film was a classic and was expecting to get drawn in and mesmorised by an amazing story. Sadly an hour into the film I failed to see the hype. The issue, was it just appeared to be a flat boring story about some well behaved kids of privelege at a school where an unorthodox English teacher who enthusiastically opens their minds and views to how poetry is romantic and can 'change the world' with all that Carpe DM BS... sorry but in the real world iv seen alot of people that are still holding onto that attitiude 'live for today don't think about tomorrow' are alcoholic, skint, singletons... Anyway I digress... the kids believe every word of it without argument and the plot never really went anywhere, the kids were neither rebellious nor transformed in their attitudes by poetry. It was just boring. I just failed to see what was so amazing about it.",3,2,7,20 April 2019
Bird Box," What has happened to cinema
","Great special effects made to look like people killing themselves with a really non thought out storyline.
The story itself think a 2 hour version of the walking dead (without the zombies) and how our heroes survive, However the acting is so corny! For example, guys wife burns herself alive while guy stands and watches from the window (doesn't really seem all that bothered by it). Bullocks Sister kills herself IN FRONT of her, however again, there is no real reaction just a bit upset. imo this is a painfully long story about some unknown supernatural identity which you never find out about that makes really corny actors kill themselves. Plus a bunch of totally unrealistic elements. Sandra Bullock rowing down a river for 48 hours straight with a blindfold on, on her own, she gets attacked and stabs the guy with a machete (blindfold still on) after wasting her bullets shooting. Goes down white water rapids with 2 kids called 'boy' and 'girl' (yep! Way to stretch the imagination there) with boat, tips, boat tips over yet they end up coming right up in shore and follow birds in the woods to a blind school (blindfolds still on) and end up living happily ever after! What the mysterious entity is you never find out, how the blind people live in the woods and get food, you never find out.... Flat out... Total rubbish.",1,2,3,4 November 2019
Gone Girl," Not bad but not good
","Where to begin... Ok the bad and then we can end on the good.
Firstly the plot as it unfolds is predictable at best, there aren't really too many omg I never thought that would happen moments. More like...oh... I kind of thought that was gonna happen. The story gradually just gets more and more ridiculous to the point where you just think why am I still putting myself through this. Plus the plot lines just full of holes. For one Afflek calls the police before even checking with anyone else where his wife might be and then they launch a press release and a statewide manhunt inside a week of her 'vanishing' he THEN calls her parents to see if she's with them.. Ok he does a really crud job pretending he's sad she's dissappeared but then they were looking to get a divorce so that could be allowed. Moving on we find out that his wife has staged her death to frame him so he gets lethal injection just becuase they had a few marital problems, then runs away only to get busted, meet her ex, slit his throat pretend she was raped and then return back to Affleck somehow insemminating herself with his semen when she didn't want kids!!!!! On a positive note, the camera work and special effects are decent. Story line is mediocre but it does keep you gripped until the end... Certainly nothing to write home about.",5,2,3,7 April 2019
Midsommar," Still staring at the TV in awe and shock.
","Well, didn't see that one coming. The story had me absolutley hooked from the offset and carried on right through to the end. As the plot line and characters develop the story progresses seamlessly getting and more horrific right up until the penultimate climax. Definitely worth a watch if you want to be challenged, entertained and taken by surprise!",8,1,2,6 October 2019
The Fly," How is this only 7.5?!
","What an unbelievably awesome film! Goldblums performance was incredible, believable and so intriguing, not only with how he adopted physiological changes but the psychological implications of himself and how all around him were indeed impacted. Performances were intwined nicely and every scene offered gripping suspense right from the start to the very end! Paveing the way for future cinema. Phoenominal. Will definitley put it up there with films such as Alien.",10,0,0,31 March 2019
Rosemary's Baby," They don't make them like this anymore!
",Simply a masterpiece of a story in the way it slowly draws you in and along Rosemary's psychological journey is absolutley outstanding. Constant up and downs and hints leaving you wondering whether she's going totally insane or whether there really is something incredibly sinister going on. I wouldn't say this is 'scary' but the thing I really loved about the film was the fact I had to keep guessing making it a brilliant psychological horror and a gripping watch.,8,0,0,29 September 2019
