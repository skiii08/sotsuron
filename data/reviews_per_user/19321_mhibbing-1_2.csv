Hereditary," Headed for cult status of the 'so bad it's good' variety
","Saw this film with my teenage kids and it was without question one of the dumbest, non-scary, pretentious, horror movies that I have ever seen. The acting is insanely over the top, the plot was just plain stupid, it dragged on endlessly while all the while appearing to go nowhere. Then the unthinkable 'happened'.... and SAVED the entire evening! The movie got so bizarre and so bad that it became 'good'. Seriously folks, I was furious up to that point feeling duped by all of the obvious shill reviews and then the plot took a 'hard right' and the audience was in fits of laughter as a result. Without revealing any 'spoilers' (and trust me there is no such thing as 'SPOILERS' when it comes to this movie) it gets so incomprehensibly bad that the entire audience lost their collective lunches. There were jokes flying and howling right through to the credits. Under normal circumstances this would have annoyed me, having paid over $85.00 for admittance and concessions only to have people making jokes and screaming loudly. But oddly enough, it actually salvaged what was to that point an awfully traumatic movie going experience. In fact, me and the kids laughed all the way home. Yes, it's THAT bad.
 If you don't believe me, look up all the reviews from people who did NOT like this film and see how many of their reviews mention the unintentional comedy at films end and the audiences reaction to it. It's so bad that it's not to be believed.
 My experience watching this film reminded me of the scene in the movie 'The Producers' where the audiences initial response to 'Springtime for Hitler' was one of utter disbelief, only to end in uproarious laughter by the plays intermission. This was me and the kid's experience EXACTLY. 
 So, to sum up: if your looking for a genuinely scary horror film with a great plot and capable acting that'll have you on the edge of your seat, stay as far away as humanly possible from this hot mess. However, if your looking for 'The Room' with a supposed horror theme, this movie is for YOU!",1,2,6,4 October 2018
La La Land," One of the best movies I've seen this year! (or any other year for that matter)
","I've always been a fan, not just of fine acting in a movie, but of well written movie as well. In both instances La La Land does not disappoint. From the opening scene to the end credits, La La Land is one of the most Thought provoking, emotionally fulfilling, and romantic films in recent memory. The pacing is perfect. The acting and writing so good, that the movie seemed a lot shorter than it's actual run-time (around two hours). Yes, it's that good.It's funny too, because Jazz is one of my least favorite musical genres. However, this did not adversely affect my enjoyment of the film one bit. It was simply Sebastian's passion (Ryan Gosling) as Mia's (Emma Stone)was acting. This film has won many awards and deservedly so. It's not by accident that the scores on IMDb, Rotton tomatoes, and metacritic are off the charts. I understand that universal acclaim does not guarantee that one will enjoy this film, as I myself have seen films in the past that were wildly popular that I did not enjoy as much as the majority. But the fact of this films success should grab your attention at least.I guess what it comes down to is whether you like Musicals with original songs that are actually memorable long after the movies over. Or whether you enjoy an intelligent movie that's well written and executed to near perfection. Or if you enjoy the work of Emma Stone or Ryan Gosling. Because if you like all or only some of the above things than your almost assuredly going to enjoy La La Land!",10,11,21,20 January 2017
