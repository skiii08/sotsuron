Mission: Impossible III," Smart, Gritty and Brilliant!
","I admit to not having seen the previous two film in the series, so I wasn't really sure of what I was about to see. I was in for a surprise, as M:I:3 turned out to be the best action film of the year so far. Splashed with unforgettable action scenes and tension, it has definitely earned itself a position in my Top Ten of the year.The plot starts with pulse-pounding scene in which Owen Davian is threatening Ethan Hunt's wife. The film then takes us back to show us what led up to that event. It is really all about something called the 'Rabbit's Foot' which Owen wants at all costs. The plot is simple, but it develops throughout leaving you to try and guess who is in league with Owen.Tom Cruise is Agent Ethan Hunt for the third time, and I must confess that I have a grand admiration for him, even though he has never yet won a golden statuette. Also in the film are couple of characters, which aren't that developed, mainly Ethan Hunt's associates and Philip Seymour Hoffman (fresh from his Oscar winning interpretation of Truman Capote) as the criminal mastermind Owen Davian. The latter was an inappropriate casting for the role mainly due to his. well. physical attributes. Yes, he is way too fat to be a proper rival in hand-to-hand combat with Tom Cruise. Ethan's team-mates are different, but they lack much depth which could have been present. Michelle Monaghan's portrayal of Julia was slightly mediocre, but it didn't really matter. As I have just mentioned, it is Tom Cruise's film and he has proved to still be a gifted actor. After being overshadowed by young Dakota Fanning's terrific (screaming) performance, he has finally been given the opportunity to excel.However, the core of the film is its breathtaking action sequences. Starting off with a loud and original helicopter chase in a wind farm after the escape from the factory, the film immediately finds its pace and from then on, we are given an action sequence almost every ten minutes. Arguably, the mission isn't impossible until the third act, but it is still an interesting action spectacle. Another scene which piqued my interest was the scene in the Vatican City. What I liked about it was that it was a one of those sophisticated pre-planned sequences, present in 'Ocean's Eleven/Twelve'. Therefore, you may be slightly disappointed to find that the action becomes rather clumsy in the final scenes.A problem I found whilst viewing it at the cinema, was that I lost track of what was happening and there was a lot of confusion towards the end when the tables are turned. It is a minor flaw, though, so it shouldn't be an excuse not to see the film. Another slight problem was that the relationship between Ethan Hunt and Julia was rather vague and we didn't get to see the turmoil in their relationship, when Julia becomes suspicious. This was a mistake done to increase the number of explosive action scenes in the film. However, the action is top notch, so once again, this isn't a major problem.Another thing, which I approved of, was that there is a different scenario for every scene, and this elevated the viewer's interest in virtually every scene  from the dazzling night lights of Eastern Asia, to the class and beauty of the Vatican. It literally takes you from one place to another and intensifies the action places, by setting the scene in places you are unlikely to visit, such as the Vatican underground.Verdict All I can say is that this one great movie which shall leave its imprint on you. Not to be missed!",9,0,2,31 March 2007
Over the Hedge," Brilliant
","Despite being my favorite animated film of the year, opening against the mush talked-about 'The Da Vinci Code' certainly didn't help it become a major success. Nevertheless, I must say that I am slightly shocked to see that it was overlooked at many award giving ceremonies and prizes. Apart from sporting an over-the-top voice cast, the film also appeals to all ages. The animation is cute and of unprecedented beauty. The characters are also great fun and they are voiced to perfection by the likes of Bruce Willis, Avril Lavigne, Eugene Levy, and Catherine O'Hara. Oh, and that's not mentioning Steve Carrel who had my sides aching with laughter, as his turn as the hyper-active squirrel easily becomes an all-time favorite character. As I have previously mentioned there is huge fun and I loved the ironic twist on many ordinary things.VerdictIn my opinion, this was the best cartoon film of the year, boasting a great look and some of the best voice talents in the business.",9,1,2,31 March 2007
The Illusionist," 2006' Hidden Gem
","Each year, an underdog movie proves to be very successful and critically acclaimed. This year the post was covered by The Illusionist, a beautiful period romance with enough suspense and mystery to give The Prestige a run for its money.Young Edward has abnormal powers and is a gifted illusionist. He begins a relationship with a noble young girl Sophie, but their relationship is forbidden, and when they are discovered they are forced never to see each other again. Many years later, Edward returns to Vienna for a performance, where he meets Sophie once again. She is about to marry the heir to the throne, but her love for Edward is too strong, forcing her to plan an escape to run away with Edward.Being a low-budget picture, the performances are somewhat vital and The Illusionist easily suits this criteria. As Edward, Edward Norton gives a remarkably touching performance, aided by Jessica Biel, who swaps beauty for tears, in a role which gives the film credibility and emotion. Paul Giamatti has once again been overlooked by many critics in a role which he deals with in an excellent, if not perfect, manner. Another role which is very important is that of Rupert Everett as the Prince. He can switch from sneaky to menacing in a second and he brings terror to the light, Somehow, apart from these characters, others have no significant importance devoting the story to them.Unlike many other movies, this manages to keep you on the edge of your seat without making use of any amazing special effects. When Eisenheim (Edward), is aided by Sophie to perform the mirror trick, the simple yet haunting red cloak makes the trick visually unforgettable; a risk any other blockbuster movie, The Prestige, would've unlikely taken. Nevertheless, if you don't think that simplicity is an asset, I advise you to steer clear from this picture.As for the story, based on a short novel, it is unexpectedly smart, and whilst the audience may work out the enigma, which is thankfully credible. The suspense is incredible, and whilst the audience is nearly always prepared for what is about to happen, you can still feel a gnawing sensation in your stomach. However, I advise you not to try and work the mystery out, as you shall probably be disappointed by the sudden twists.VerdictA beautiful and captivating romantic mystery from start to finish. Definitely one of this year's hidden gem.",9,0,0,25 March 2007
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," It's Not Flawless, but is a Triumph Over the Original
","In a summer in which each sequel has proved to be disappointing and less stunning than its predecessors, Silver Surfer is like a ray of hope. Spiderman may have drawn the crowd, but its intense marketing left fans and others viewers expecting more. Surfer on the other hand has been an underdog story. With little yet sufficient marketing campaigns, FF2 may truly be the sleeper hit of the summer.At the beginning of the film we find luckless Sue and Reed trying to tie the knot when a mysterious force ruins their wedding day. Driven by this, the four heroes begin their intensive research and start attempting to catch the enigmatic Silver Surfer. All seems to be going well, until an old friend returns from Latevria.Performances in FF were weak, and I cannot say that they have improved so much. Nevertheless, this time they somehow become more than simply awesome humans for children. Ioan Gruffudd is back as the Silver Surfer, and I am in favor of the writers' decision to bring him out like a proper nerd, which he is the comics. Jessica Alba falls into that category of actresses which have looks, but little talent, even though this kind of blandness is evident in Sue too. Chris Evans is definitely one of the most up and coming stars of Hollywood, and whilst judging him on his acting isn't that easy, he's got that charisma and charm which easily makes him an audience favorite. In the last film, Michael Chiklis, as the Thing, had a far more interesting role, as he was insecure and ashamed of how he was, and whilst it's certainly a nice change to have a superhero film without these internal conflicts, his character is ignored.In terms of action sequences, the film delivers, and whilst it certainly is becoming boring to see Sue Storm producing force fields, the Silver Surfer is extremely welcome, as he pumps up the action. From the thrilling city chase to the evasion of rockets during his capture, every moment in which he's on the screen, the film sees a colossal improvement. Dr. Doom has lost his charm and his final showdown is rather disappointing. And even though Galactus isn't as awe inspiring as in the comics, the scale is huge and it gives rise to much more exciting sequences.The special effects have improved and whilst the Silver Surfer is the main highlight, Galactus is also a feast for the eyes. However, my favorite special effects sequence has to the creation of the crater in the river Thames. The scene was climatic and you could for once feel the tension and fear of the citizens.A disappointment in the film has to be the lack of emotion. When Sue and Reed plan to abandon the group you'd expect some more drama, but everything is shallow and the film goes on without giving any importance to these scenes which could be emotional heavyweights.VerdictFantastic Four 2 has its flaws, but unless you are one of those people who start freaking out as soon as they see something that is different from the comic, then you'll find this film to be a relaxing and fun treat, coupled with a priceless 93 minute running time.",8,17,35,1 July 2007
Transformers," Action, Humour.......and More Action
","Transformers Finally a non-sequel!!! It's not that this year's sequels weren't good, but you have to admit that the vast number of franchises was getting stale. In comes Transformers with as much hype to fill in the entire world's theatres, and whilst this film is not for girls, it is one hell of a ride for fans of the original animated series and even to those who didn't know who the hell Meagatron was!In Qatar the American military forces, are attacked by a mysterious and unknown force, which leaves many dead with the sole exceptions of Captain Lennox (Josh Duhamel) and his team. Meanwhile, back in the 'normal' world, luckless Sam gets his first car, which incidentally turns out to be an autobot with the name Bumblebee. Eager to impress high-school hottie Mikela, Sam offers her a ride, but when things start to go wrong and Sam is attacked by one of the Deceptions, Sam and Mikela must put aside their prejudices and work alongside the Autobots led by the legendary Optimus Prime in an epic battle against the Deceptions under the commands of the menacing Megatron.I wasn't expecting any superb acting turns from this movie, but I was surprised to find that the film sported many good performances. Shia LeBeouf is an excellent choice for the role of Sam WitWicky, giving a performance bustling with charisma and crackling with energy. He has been rightly tagged as Hollywood's next big thing! Megan Fox is a newcomer, but even though when she was on screen, her acting skills were the last thing I was thinking about. Still, her character is ruddy brilliant, and Michael Bay gad already used this technique with Scalett Johannsen on The Island. Josh Duhamel isn't bad either, even though his problems and inner conflict are hardly hinted at. Jon Voigt's character is unnecessary and is in my opinion miscast as his role should have gone to a younger, more menacing actor. But overall, this is a very good haul, with the young leads obviously standing out.The screenplay is decent, and the dialogue is classic Michael Bay. What bothers me is that when important topics are raised these are drained by an explosion or any other form of noisy distraction. Pity though! Also the film is unbelievably humorous, and whilst most of its humour is dark, the jokes centre on awkwardness and embarrassment instead of the usual slapstick humour. The film also goes around the usual boy meets girl fun, and this played quite well, with LeBeouf easily making us sympathize with him.The special effects are unprecedented, and this is because it is much more difficult to use special effects with robots which are huge and made up of a good many things, than with let's say Spiderman. The effects are put to good use, but they never take complete control. Megatron is obviously the film's tour-de-force and the Autobots are similarly good, even though the voice acting could've been far better. Still, their ridiculousness had me roaring with laughter! The final battle is epic, but it's a little to.busyto truly stand out. Mini battles happen within the big battle which causes confusion.Verdict If treated as a comedy, this film will go down in film history books, as an action movie, it is the mother of all, but as the best film of the year, it needs more drama to go down with the brilliant humour and action.",9,5,9,3 August 2007
Blood Diamond," An Interesting Approach to the Blood Diamond Industry
","2006 floundered with brilliant politically motivated flicks. Now with 2007 just beginning to blossom, Blood Diamond can call itself the first proper and serious movie of the year.Solomon lives a normal life, working as a fisherman, but when his family is taken away by the rebel forces, his life is dramatically changed. His fate gets worse when he discovers a huge diamond, which is desired by everyone. In the meantime, a professional diamond smuggler learns about the diamond and bargains with Solomon that he will help him find his family in exchange for the diamond's whereabouts. Also joining the small traveling duo is an American journalist desperately searching for some information about the blood diamond industry.In a film featuring three Oscar-nominated actors and two for the film itself, Blood Diamond cannot help, but benefit from its stunning performances. At the helm is Leonardo DiCaprio, who develops a South-African accent, and gives his most mature and yet touching performance to date. Another worthy performer is Djimon Hounsou, who has been previously seen in a brief role in the remarkable 'The Island'. His performance is brave and despite the fact that the viewer may not side for him for most of the film, one can still feel his pain and suffering. Unfortunately, the understated Jennifer Connelly, isn't given as ample screen tome, as her fellow actors. She is very convincing as a journalist who truly cares about what is happening in these nations. Other actors who occasionally pop in aren't unwelcome either.Despite having a very dramatic subject, the film still allows itself a series of breathtaking and entirely engaging sequence, which vary from wild street shootouts to an explosion in a diamond mine. These frequent scenes are handled with ease and the actors easily transmit their emotions even in these adrenalin pumped sequences. Some seem out of place, but in my opinion they help this film become a rather exciting feature rather than a two-hour long lecture. The only problem with these scenes is that they are not given a Hollywood touch, but are confined to some endless blind shooting by the rebels and the government. Blood flows like water, and corpses linger around every corner.Finally, I also applaud the movie for its ability to tug at a few heartstrings every now and then. Teens and adults who are not aware of what is happening are urged to see this film as it raises many important issues which aren't normally tackled in such a manner. It is isn't enough to make you feel the dirt rubbing against your diamond-laden fingers, but is enough to make think twice before buying a diamond which has been imported from Africa. In fact, the audience shall be shocked to see children chanting war raves, and shooting mercilessly at innocent and helpless civilians which simply want to get on with their normal lives.Verdict What could have been a long and tiring documentary about the troubles in Sierra Leone is turned into a star-powered vehicle with raises some very important issues. Smart, searing and seemingly ruthless, this is a must-see if not for its laid back action sequences.",9,0,1,25 March 2007
Casino Royale," The Best Bond film in Ages
","As soon as Daniel Craig was picked as the new Bond, many fans started tearing their hair off in. rage. Nobody was ready for a change, but now, the film has been released and has shut everyone's mouth up.At the center of the plot is Le Chiffre a terrorist trafficker. Recently promoted Bond is assigned to find him and stop him. However, even when the case seems closed, this nemesis still keeps turning up making this one of most pulse pounding Bond adventures ever.Don't listen to rumors! This new James Blond is top notch. He may look awkward in a formal dinner jacket, but Daniel Craig handles each action scene with ease. This new Bond cracks a couple of joke every now and then and this suits him well. Even better is Eva Green, who is truly unforgettable as Bond's love interest, Vesper Lynd. Finally a girl with brains! I mean, Halle Berry handled a similar role well, but she doesn't compare. I just wished she knew how to handle a gun. Then there is also Danish superstar Mads MIkkelsen as the rather menacing Le Chiffre. He has an impeccable English accent and this makes it easier for the viewer to comprehend what is being said. Italian model Caterina Murino also has a brief role in the film as Solange. However, her inclusion is unnecessary as she has no crucial role in the story. It's also good to see Dame Judi Dench back as M, but other signature Bond characters such as Q and Ms. Moneypenny are nowhere to be seen.Apart from very talented acting, the film also has some memorable action sequences. The airport scene may prove to be overlong and pointless, but the brutal torture scene and the final clash in Venice turn out to be excellent. The violence in the movie is quite strong, which is a good thing seeing that barely any blood is shed in many recent action movies.The screenplay is also very good. In fact it was polished by Crash director Paul Haggis. It packs a dozen of unexpected surprises which sometimes make you stutter in disbelief and dread. However, as I have previously mentioned, the film's most remarkable feat is the touching relationship between Vesper and Bond. The bone-crunching climax had me in tears. Now that is something nearly impossible to achieve! The film's locations are all déjà vu, especially the beautiful beach in Madagascar, which resembles the bay in Cuba which was featured in Die Another Day.Verdict Overall, the film is a huge triumph especially for newcomer Daniel Craig. However, it is Eva Green's character which ultimately leaves its imprint on you.",10,0,4,25 March 2007
Happy Feet," A Film from the Heart
","Whilst his film certainly didn't deserve the Oscar it won, it would be somehow wrong to give the film black looks. This is mainly because the film has a lovely color palette and the musical numbers certainly succeeded in melting my heart. Had this film concentrated on its music, I am sure it would have fared better. However, the film goes on to give a lecture on global warming and kindness towards penguins. And that is where Happy Feet looses track. The theme of an outcast becoming a hero has already been used in the much inferior 'The Ant Bully', but it somehow steers slightly away from it only to find itself where 'Finding Nemo' had already treaded. The voice cast is decent, and the mildly perilous sequences aren't shameful either. However, the film still lacks novelty value.VerdictThis is a keen attempt to cash in on the buzz created by 'March of the Penguins'  not my kind of fun.",5,0,1,31 March 2007
V for Vendetta," One of the best comic book adaptations
","As soon as the first few posters of V appeared at the local multiplexes, everyone knew that it was going to be something special. Then you see it was produced by the producers of League of Extraordinary Gentleman. That film was almost risible and so yet another Alan Moore comic-book adaptation went wrong. The only hope that Moore's work would be finely adapted was in V for Vendetta, which turns out to be everything that the other ones were not. Set in the future, the film shows a country ruled by a fascist government headed by the scheming High Chancellor. The people are so clouded by fear that they do not rebel. That is until the cloaked V shows up to wreck havoc and to bring the government's wrong doings to the light. In his plan to do so, he is aided by the innocent Evey, who after being rescued by V, is introduced to a world she had never seen before. To maximize a good film to the full, there is need of a good cast, and V unfortunately falls short of reasonably good performances. Natalie Portman is as good as ever, and her portrayal of Evey stood out next to the others, which were by far more mediocre. She effortlessly handles that typical British accent, and even though I doubt you will ever be moved by her tears, she was still credible for most of the film. The real problem is V. Hugo Weaving does an adequate job of expressing his with sinister nods and head tilts, but there was still very little emotion and it was therefore very wooden. He handles his action scenes very well, but that is still not enough to make his character not beg for belief. John Hurt's interpretation as the High Chancellor is also one of those few who excel. His scenes overflow with menace and hidden desperation. That said, the film is good on many accounts. The action is limited, but the few scenes are violent and blood is plentiful, which is not so common these days. The slow-mo knife-time sequences are brilliant as are the few big explosions in the film. The film also has an interesting political background, which gave the film a more realistic image. The problem is that the film rarely probes into some questions which arise, and it fails to give some scenes the adequate emotional content. However, a couple of scenes speak for themselves. The scene in which V loads an underground train with loads of explosives reminded me of the terrible underground terrorist attacks in London a year ago. This thought was enough to give me the chills. I also admire the director's decision to never take of V's mask. Thus, this avoided the common Phantom of the Opera shock and the identity revelation as in Spiderman 2 and Batman Begins. Instead, we are left to imagine how his face and ultimately, his whole body, may look like. Speaking of appearances, it is also horrific to see Evey tortured and have her hair shaved off. Yet these startling images help fortify the message the film tries to deliver. Good and to the point, V for Vendetta drives its point home easily. Pity it doesn't have a better cast.",10,1,4,25 March 2007
