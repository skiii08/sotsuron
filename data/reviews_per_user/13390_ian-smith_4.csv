Requiem for a Dream," The Requiem for A Dream
","This movie, without question, is in my top 3. The only two that top it are the first two Godfather movies, which I see as classics in the overall genre of film. But, for those who only see Requiem for a Dream as a drug related movie, I say 'Wake up!' The movie focuses on four main characters: Sara Goldfarb, an aging elderly woman who has no one special in her life but her son, and is a widow, and tries to fill the void in her life by watching television. After receiving a phone call (most likely a hoax) from a television company which 'discovers' (ha yeah right....just like i win a free laptop by picking out a picture of Paris hilton) stars and talents for television stars...finally finds some meaning in her life aside from her only son, Harry (Jared Leto). Meanwhile, three drug junkies....Harry Goldfarb, Tyrone C. Love (Marlon Wyans, in my opinion, the only worthwhile performance he's ever given) and Marion Silver (Jennifer Connelly) each face different dreams: Harrry's dreams of making it big, to not have to haul off his mother's TV every week to make bread to deal with his increasing drug addiction and to put it in his own words, to just make his mother happy.....Tryone's dream of becoming something more than just a street peddler, and Marion's dream of being loved by her parents', to replace her parents love of money with something tangible...like their daughter. Each dream is shattered by a complex unraveling of the said dreams....ruined and drowned by their own addictions. The cinematography is the best I have ever seen...and the acting is by far, superior. I won't give away anything else...only to let reader's know I have been a serious viewer of movies for 10 plus years now...and I find 'Requiem for a Dream' to be one of a kind and my third favorite movie of more than close to 500 I have watched. For the love of GOD watch this movie if you haven't before. It will change your perspective.",10,3,6,28 February 2007
The Godfather: Part II," A Very Close Call
","When I first saw Godfather Part I, I was a little skeptical about the sequel. There really didn't seem to be a lot to build on. Now, a couple of years later, and far wiser, I must say that in my humble opinion, that Godfather Part II is just a little bit better than the first. Again, the same cast is here, save for the characters who passed away in the first chapter. Once again, I believe that the actors gave unscrupulous performances, some far better than they gave in the first Godfather. Talia Shire, for example: sure her character gets a lot more screen time in this one, however she seemed much more grounded and into character in this sequel. Al Pacino completely takes Michael Corleone to a completely new and fantastic level, completely making a 360 degree turn from the Michael we first met as a Marine Corps Captain who wanted nothing to do with the family business. He actually becomes a feared and somewhat hated character in these movies. In this sense, hated is not a bad thing. You want to hate him for killing his brother. You want to hate him for the way he treats his wife. The dramatic turn of events between Michael and Kay is so powerful it is awe-inspiring. And how can you not love the story that is also being told at the same time of a young Vito Corleone? A marvelous performance by a young Robert De Niro, who brings to life the beginnings of who would become the unquestioned lord of legalized crime. De Niro is marvelous, and the only actor who could have possibly pulled it off better is Marlon Brando himself, but for obvious reasons could not play this role. You see a young Vito witness the deaths of his mother, father, and older brother and escape from the local crime boss in Corleone, Italy on a ship bound for America. You see him as a young man, graciously losing his job because he had to be let go, and then gaining friends and earning respect whenever he himself kills the 'Black Hand', a figure in the New York slums who took full advantage of his high position. The reason I believe this movie is better than the first is only because of the more complex story and the dramatic, bittersweet climax of the characters. This movie is truly brilliant, and it is a very close call between this one and the first which one is the best. Truly beautiful.",10,0,2,6 July 2005
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," A Memorable Story
","This movie is a love story, except if you go in to see it, it's anything but ordinary. First things first, you must let your imagination roam a little bit. The whole process of being able to actually be inside your own mind as you slowly watch the love of your life being erased in front of your very eyes can be a bit much if you don't use your imagination. Best thing to do, put yourself, whether your male or female, in Joel Barrish's (Jim Carey) shoes. Now, the basics of the story are very relatable. Man and woman meet, opposites attract, and they fall in love. However, as with all things in life, they come to part ways. Joel discovers rather quickly, after running into his former girlfriend Clementine (Kate Winslet), that she has had him permanently erased from her memory. Confused, Joel seeks out the doctor who performed the procedure, and in a fit of anger, possibly even revenge, he decides to have the procedure done himself. However, as the procedure takes place, as he moves from the last memory of Clementine (a wonderful scene mixed with harsh feelings and dialogue) backwards to the memories of when the relationship was at it's peak, he begins to realize that in his heart he still loves her. Joel panics, and begins to think of every way possible to change the track of his memories so that Clementine will still be there in his mind whenever he wakes up. Fate, nonetheless, does not conspire with him, and he finally comes to the last (or in this case, the first) memory; the one where he and Clementine first met. The following scene is absolutely wonderful. This is where it all comes together...everything that has happened in the story, with the addition of the strong feeling's Joel has for Clementine (and in Clementine's case, the feelings she may still have for Joel), it all climax's in this beautiful scene, highlighted with:Clementine: This is it, Joel...it's going to be gone soon. Joel: I know... Clementine: What should we do? Joel: (pauses) Enjoy it.This scene comes crashing down and gave me such a great case of emotion, because Joel, even after trying to hide from having Clementine erased learns this simple lesson: Life is fleeting. Life, and the people you meet and love, is a gift. And even though he knows he is about to lose her forever, instead of trying to run and hide, he swallows those feelings back, and tells himself to 'enjoy it,' a truly mature and engaging line that will bring chills down your spine. And the final scene in the house, brings the climax to it's end in a truly remarkable way. As they say their final goodbyes inside an old house on the beach, as Joel's character let's out every single emotion and thought inside of his heart out. Not only is the dialogue amazing, but the image of that memory being erased and the fact that he is losing her is amplified by the fact that as the scene slowly progresses, the house begins to fall apart. You begin to feel such an apathy for these characters, and maybe it's because we've all been there before. Everyone of us. This story is so relatable it forces you to become immersed in the story's emotions and characters. The writing and directing simply phenomenal, my hat's go off to Micheal Gondry. The only reason I give this movie a nine of ten is the ending. I won't give away too many details, because the ending makes the story. I would've changed the ending slightly and not have gone into the ending like the story portrays. However, my opinions aside, if you haven't seen this movie, you must. It may be confusing at first, but you'll get it. Watch it again if you need to. But if after watching this movie, if you don't re-examine certain aspects of your life, if this movie doesn't make you love your significant other ever more or make you pine for the lost love of your life, then unfortunately you didn't get the point. Watch it one more time. For those of you who do feel as if you have watched an eye-opener, take life by the horns and 'enjoy it.'",9,1,3,15 August 2005
The Godfather," Brilliantly Haunting
","To begin with, I had not seen the Godfather, nor its subsequent sequels, until about two years ago. I have only one thing to say about this: Why? Why did I not see this sooner? Francis Ford Coppolla creates a brilliantly haunting masterpiece, full of drama, and perfectly sets the mood, entrancing you frame by frame into the world of legalized crime. Marlon Brando shines in quite possibly his greatest performance ever as the Don Vito Corleone. While he may not appear to be a truly menacing figure, as the viewer you instantly respect him with the way he carries himself and his words. Brando's range of emotions, the way every line he speaks is with conviction of a man who is so wise, truly defines the character that I'm not sure anyone originally thought could be so strong. The next main cast standout is Al Pacino, who gives here a staggering performance as Vito's youngest son, Michael. The transformation of his character is absolutely incredible, from the mild-mannered Captain in the United States Marine Corps, to the future and eventual Godfather of the Corleone Family. Pacino completely grasps his role and takes on an entirely different life himself, to the point where we forget he is an actor. The rest of the cast is extremely superb, all the way down to the most minute character. Perhaps the two most touching scenes are 1) When Michael visit's his father in the hospital after the attempted murder at the hands of the Tattaglia family, and 2) After James Caan's character, Santino 'Sonny' Corleone, is albeit brutally shot numerous times, and Vito Corleone asks the mortuary to 'use all of his powers' to fix his son, because he 'didn't want his mother to see him like this.' This is truly a magnificent story, filled with betrayal, family loyalty, and eventual heartbreak. A marvelous masterpiece from both Copolla and Mario Puzo, who wrote the screenplay (and the later who wrote the novel). And to think that Paramount almost fired both Copolla and Pacino because they weren't the first choices! That would have been an insult! If that had happened, I would not be here, commenting on this movie, because it would not have been anywhere near as beautiful of a film. If you haven't seen this yet, see it now! Don't wait another minute! If you have, watch it again. And again. And again. Now, I'm going to end this review, and watch it myself.",10,0,2,6 July 2005
