Mission: Impossible III," MI-3:Nothing is Impossible!! It totally rocks!!
","Wait till you see MI-3 and i would not blame you if you forget the first two parts after seeing this one.The best of the trilogy so far without a shadow of a doubt!!! When you see the first action sequence in Germany, you think it couldn't be topped.But then comes sequence after sequence which blows you away with the final sequence in Shanghai totally blows you off your feet! The best action flick from Cruise in a long long time..And boy oh boy what a guy t ocast opposite him..the Oscar winner himself and he totally rocks..His body language and mannerisms are apt! I don't like to give too much details as i think you have to watch it to enjoy it!! Go for it immediately!!",9,6,11,3 May 2006
