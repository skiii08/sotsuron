Hereditary," The worst sci-fi thriller since Attack of the Killer Tomatoes
","While some of the special effects were well done, this movie takes you down a road of confusion and absolute silliness!!! This story leaves the viewer with no satisfaction of any kind. The writers were obviously short on material and added fillers of please, please, please, on two different occasions in the movie, what a disappointment!!! I don't understand how this movie has received the accolades it has!!!
I beg that the producers and writers ask for forgiveness and go back to the drawing board and produce something that's worth paying $15 for!!!",1,20,45,17 June 2018
