Requiem for a Dream," Oh Goodie, another drug flick!
","'Requiem for a Dream' (hereafter 'Requiem') may be well-acted, expertly-directed, and perfectly explicative of the situation drug users find themselves in but I'm not in a position to tell you about any of those things. I know nearly nothing about making movies and know even less about drugs. So instead of singing praises for how well this film portrays a certain kind of lifestyle, or for discussing its artistic merit, I'll restrict my comments to experience watching the film. In short, it was boring.The film has very little plot. It's quite evident from the beginning that it sets up a parallel between drug abuse by the mother of the main character, the main character himself, and his friends. The film makes it quite clear that it'll track their comings and goings as they sink further into addiction and watch the substance of their lives slip away. It tries to weave these parallel stories together in a way that dramatizes their experience. It turns out that this is not a really engaging way to arrange the events of an film. It's kind of, well, boring.The film uses lots of dizzying imagery to, I suppose, express what the drug-influenced characters may be feeling. These effects irritate the senses. There's nothing interesting about watching a character on screen act kinda crazy and see his fridge come to life. Similarly, it's not fun to be subjected to erratic camera movement or any of the film's other visual effects. When time is condensed and the camera moves about the scene swiftly, the viewer is often left remembering why he or she doesn't spin in offices chairs for fun: because being dizzy is not enlightening or interesting, it just makes one feel sick.Let me close by saying that I really don't understand the drug film genre. Films of this type often seek to tell us how awful our lives can be if we become addicted to drugs. But I don't think this is such a valuable service. I, for one, I already knew that; reason helped me conclude such without Hollywood's help. I therefore cannot imagine that films like this can actually be deterrents, instead they stand as documentation of what it must be like to live a horrible existence. These films can't really be artistic, per se, they can just give us a look into a much worse life than reason allows us to pursue. If that kind of thing gives you your kicks, by all means watch the film. If, however, you prefer films that tell stories about complexities inherent in living reasoned, well-examined lives this film will prove to be just a bore. Skip it and watch a film that offers substance instead of pseudo-experience.",2,3,6,20 January 2007
Pan's Labyrinth," Don't Drink the Kool-Aid: Pan Sucks
","Pan's Labyrinth (hereafter 'Pan') is, perhaps, the most disappointing film I've seen this year. This is so largely because of the sweeping praise the film has received by both critics and the general public. (As of this writing the film is at #47 on IMDb's top 250 list; how tragic).The film is difficult to categorize because of its strange blend of seemingly incompatible elements. The grotesque violence -- akin to that of gangster films like Goodfellas and The Departed -- is an ill fit for a fantasy film that aims to charm the viewer with ferries and a plot driven by an adolescent girl's interaction with a fantasy world. This really is a film that scatters wartime action scenes amidst Narnia-style childish indulgences. To my ethnocentric American mind, this seems like a tremendous mistake. Does this strange mix work for the rest of the world? Pan also fails to deliver a visually-appealing viewer experience. Most of the film feels soiled, dark, sticky, and unappealing. This might have worked if the foul scenery of Spain were contrasted with surreal fantasy scenes, but the film misses that boat entirely. The few minutes we spend in fantasy scenes are nearly as dismal as the time we spend engulfed in lackluster forests and a grungy military installation. The fantasy characters, too, are nearly as vile and detestable as the human villains in the film. The movie fails to give the viewer anything to hope for but the closing credits. This seriously inhibits any hope the viewer might have developed for a pleasant outcome for the film's more likable characters.I concede that the story was not completely contrived and banal. But just because it wasn't familiar doesn't mean it was interesting. Unfortunately, Pan fails to engage the viewer enough that even unpredictable fantasy events can be found exciting. Where's the adventure in the little girl's trials in the labyrinth? Where is the suspense in her escape from the silly underground creature? Why do I find it so difficult to care for the girl's welfare as she is pursued by the evil Captain at the end? It is, of course, because this film is simply mediocre. But its European setting would suggest otherwise to the average American mind.After watching the film I understand the current surge of film-lust I've seen for Pan. I think the fact that this film sports a more novel, albeit boring, plot than films we commonly see in this country helps some to inflate its better qualities. What would otherwise be considered just good performances are given high accolades. Silly special effects and awful c.g. become passable (seriously people, that frog character and the growing root effects could be generated on my P.C. over lunch). To be honest, I think this film benefited a great deal from its distribution in Spanish: to the starry-eyed American viewer it takes on an exotic feel. If presented in a more average American mode, perhaps its fan-boys would've found this film as empty and unengaging as I did.",1,25,56,22 October 2007
