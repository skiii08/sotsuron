Sucker Punch," If the movie takes hold of you it's one stunning wild dream
","I must say that this movie really took hold of me. The cinematography is stunningly beautiful, the music is painfully fitting and the entire movie is one wild dream. However, as the credits also state, it's 'Cruel and uneasy' and slightly uncomfortable to watch and this movie will leave your mind wandering for days.Ignore all the comments on acting and the plot, this movie IS really affecting, but only on a completely different way then the standard drama movies and many people fail to understand this because they lack the open mind to watch a film that does not follow the Hollywood formula and that is unlike any other film you will see.And if you have this open mind, you end up wanting to watch it again for all the fine metaphors and nuances of the intertwining realities in this film.",9,4,7,23 June 2012
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," True star wars fan is inspired again :)
","So basically I decided not to watch this movie after reading all the sad reviews that are super negative. It expresses how silly reactions on the internet can sometimes turn out.I loved the movie it was magical, and from all 8 star wars movies I watched (i'm not excluding the side stories here...) I felt that this had one of the most exquisite beautiful magical scores of all of them possessing more depth and beauty than earlier John Williams' works. It definitely has a most poetic score.Poetry was also strongly found in visual star wars landscapes and big themes. However it sometimes turned out a little bit over dramatic and funny or off in a way that acting or director's choice of humour was diminishing storytelling. Especially Luke Skywalkers' acting felt mostly weak or at times a bit silly.However being a true star wars fan, I do not get put away by things as poor acting. The classical Star Wars feel, magical worlds, characters, story telling and drama (although slightly overdone ;) are still all there and god, I enjoyed watching that for 150 minutes! And I can't wait for the next and final star wars movie to be out in the cinema!",8,4,24,9 October 2018
