The Avengers," Avengers....ASSEMBLED !! (contains spoilers)
","Back in 2005 since Marvel Studios had just been formed they were toying with the idea of making an 'Avengers' film.At first they provided subtle hints in some after credits and well as in-movie scenes.Nick Fury appearing at the end of Iron Man and Stark appearing at the end of Incredible Hulk movie'(both talking about the avengers initiative) -we already knew what was in store for us.Finally after 5 films and a wait of 11 years (in total) we get this great film from Joss Whedon (of Buffy:TVS fame) who takes the foundation that was built in prior films and brings together the greatest team of superheroes in film history.Seriously I cant even begin to review this movie and i fear i wont be able to write much about this EPIC movie.This movie has to be seen to be believed .So ill just write down what i loved (or hated) about the movie character wise.LOKI Tom Hiddlestone gives an excellent portrayal of Loki. He appears more evil this time around compared to Thor movie.My favorite Loki scene is where he demands the people of the city to kneel before him.reminded me of ''KNEEL BEFFOORE ZOD''Capn America Portrayed by Chris Evans.This time his character is more likable compared to CA:TFA .He has the best dialogs (apart from RDJ) .The image of Chris as Human Torch is entirely wiped out from your mind, Best Capn scene :''Why should i take orders from you?'' scene.Black Widow: portrayed by Scarlett Johansson .She has a better role this time compared to Iron Man 2.Wasp should have been in the film instead of her.Hawkeye. Weakest Character of the movie.(and i am not talking strength wise or anything) Little to none back story provided.Didn't get a film based on him apart from a few minutes in THOR. Also got converted into being Loki's minion pretty fast . But the scene where he shoots at the Chitauri army without even aiming is bad-ass.Thor. portrayed by Chris Hemsworth. Simply awesome. He has the best entrance scene in the film. Fav Thor scene : Are you afraid of a little lightening ?'...'No i am afraid of what comes later'' sceneNick Fury played by Muthaf***king Samuel Jackson .Finally he gets his own movie.His mother will be proud.And why was he trying to shoot the jet with a pistol?Who does he think he is ? Tintin?Maria Hill played by Cobie Smulders. Kids back in the summer of 2012 your aunt Robin decided to join the Avengers. She had a good role BTW.Iron Man played by Robert Downey Jr.On second thoughts he doesn't even play the character.Robert Downey IS Tony Stark.Many people I know have just seen the Iron man movies and will go to see Avengers just to see him. Plays the character efficiently and wisecracking at his best . Fav Iron man scene : Suiting up Mark VII Trivia:(he wears a black sabbath shirt in this movie. Black sabbath wrote Iron Man theme in the first movie)Hulk/Bruce Banner Easily the best character of this movie.Mark Ruffalo surpasses Edward Norton in his portrayal of the green giant.Each and every scene he is in is awesome. Finally we get to see a good hulk after two mediocre HULK films. Fave hulk scene : Loki Rag doll scene.Final mention to : AGENT COULSON portrayed by Clark Gregg. R.I.P Phil Coulson ! Marvel has lost a great character with his death. His death is perhaps the biggest shock of this movie .And he couldn't even get his capn cards signed :'(But at least he died with a bang. Agent Sitwell makes a brief appearance. fave Coulson scene ? all of em.. Trivia:Joss Whedon is known fr killing of beloved characters in his shows.Technically speaking :By Hollywood standards This movie shouldn't even exist because it is way too risky. But somehow they have managed to pull it off flawlessly Marvel has already announced Iron Man 3, Thor 2 and Avengers 2 (where its pretty evident that the main villain is Thanos). They should bring War Machine back in Iron man 3.his absence is noticeable. Honestly I don't think any other 2012 movie can beat this one (though the DARK KNIGHT RISES might just do it)BTW speaking of team up movies ...does anyone remember the live action JLA movie of 1997 :p",10,3,8,28 April 2012
