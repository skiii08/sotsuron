Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Great riff on General Motors as well as a great movie
","Around the 1920s, General Motors decided it was a good idea for everyone to drive cars. Their response to this blue sky thinking was to buy up all the trolly companies that they could and close them, putting thousands of trolly workers out of their jobs across the country. Robert Zemekis' 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit?' is a brilliant allegory to the actions of General Motors in the 1920s and 30s. Think about it: An untrustworthy corporation, Cloverleaf, buys up all of the Red Car companies and plans on demolishing Toon Town in preparation for the construction of a highway. BRILLIANT! I was able to enjoy this film as a kid, laughing at the toxic relationship that exists between Eddie Valiant and Roger. Now, as an adult, I am able to enjoy it in different ways (historical, sociologically context) while still being able to laugh at the jokes. 10/10!",10,1,2,3 March 2005
The Big Lebowski," Perfect Pick-Me-Up
","If only I could count how many times this film has been able to cheer me up, I could probably only then begin to thank the Coen brothers for this gem of a film.  Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, and John Turturro fit perfectly into their characters while a stellar cast of supporting actors (Steve Buscemi, Julianne Moore, Sam Elliot) give quirky and hilarious performances.  The script is possibly the best coen script to date.  I know there was a backlash when this was first released with people looking for Fargo 2 but in my opinion this is the better film. Ten out of ten in my opinion, but for those who are offended by a few hundred curse words I suggest you steer clear of this one and rent...i don't know...goldmember or something. Anyway, see it or dont see it either way the dude will continue to abide.",10,1,2,4 March 2004
