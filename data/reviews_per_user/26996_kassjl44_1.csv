Men in Black 3," Brolin is brilliant, Smith.. not so much
","Brolin could've been nominated for an Oscar for his turn as a young Agent Kay. On the other hand, Smith made me wish that had cast Jay Pharoah as a younger version of Agent Jay, 'cause at least Pharoah is funny. The '69 Mets tie-in was great also. Overall, a solid sci-if comedy if you can overlook Smith's smattering of dud jokes and not so fresh acting. Let's Go Mets!",7,0,2,13 March 2018
