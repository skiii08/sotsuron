Walk the Line," not a good legacy for Cash
","I saw this movie and wasn't very impressed. I am in my late 50's and always liked johnny;s music, but didn't know his story now I do and now I don't like his music cause I don't like him anymore. The movie depicts Johnny Cash as I drug addict, wife beating, child hating, parent disrespecting, self centered, loser all characteristics I don't care for in a person. Watching this movie was painful and many times i just wanted to get up and leave. Reese Witherspoon deserved her Oscar but Juaquin was no Johnny cash not looks at all not voice or even mannerisms. The only time the music sounded good was at the Folsom Prison before Johnny got on the stage the prelude beat music got me pumped until Joaquin started to sing and he ruined it. I rated this movie a 5 and was to generous.",5,3,6,25 April 2006
