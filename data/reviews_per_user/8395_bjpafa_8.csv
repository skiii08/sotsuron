Hereditary," To revisit and discover
","Solid, coherent work, wider than a genre. One should subscribe the critics, it's a pleasure when an agreement takes place.
Although the ending could have been simplified, the movie is about human relations, family interactions, violent death, and all these different aspects are well defined within simbolic parameters. From expressions and maneirisms of the characters to Marquette art, all is a plus.To be revisited and reinterpreted.",8,15,29,23 August 2018
Deadpool 2," Now it is rolling.
","Plausible humor, laughability assured. That distorted X men view has finally consolidated with new recruits, a good script, an impressive result. It is genuine, insane and cute. Great work. It not understood why some prefer the first movie. Now one can feel the comics ambience surfacing.",8,1,2,18 September 2018
The Favourite," Burlesque and illness
","Although I greatly admired the lead actresses performance, I'm not sure what was the purpose of such a show of deviance and bad character, blackmail, manipulation and treachery. One arrives with a moral compass and join the forces of take it all. Another relies into an outside and forgets her softer nature. Other ultimately abuses of everyone, plays the weak, as compensation of trauma and a life of unquestioned power. Good sets, a wordrobe full, and what's this?
Burlesque satire? A comedy drama? An historical demonstration that the female of the species is more dangerous than the male?
My guess is that this is only a mess, a bad exemple to suggestionable minds.
Who am I, although, not to say that it catches the eye?
The zeitgeist wouldn't allow them three coming into terms... being nice and understanding is not selling tickets or much streaming, anyway...
An impressive ensemble.
Well, it is a show of E. I. and deception.
I guess cinema should provoke.
Today, actually, most people fell impotent facing life whithout drinking the wine. House on the hill...the children...they will...(lyrics)",7,2,5,18 July 2019
Moulin Rouge!," 18 years have past
","I guess I'm a little late. The lead couple was wonderful, maybe it seems strange to say this, but maybe that great actress, which has proven herself since so many times, should have not appeared so... perfect. Although she was and could. The other disagreement adresses the option for excess in colour, operatic excess, like a rococó experience. Why have by express choice waited such a long time to see the movie... devil may care. Congratulations and especially to our Diva. All was wonderful but maybe, too much? That was a direction decision, and has satisfied the most. I would opt for something a little more sober about the portrait of that historic location...",8,0,0,10 July 2019
Singin' in the Rain," Changing Paradigms, Reinventing Movies.
","The next twenty years will interwave cinema, television, special effects, digital arts, animation western/oriental styles, games, graphic novels, creating models we cannot see even so near to 'the Singularity' as we are.
Last century, between belle époque, art déco, art nouveau, surrealism to dadaïsme, literature from late influences of romanticism through symbolism, passing by magic realism, cubism, Kerouac, Kalo, Kandinsky only to use three of the same as Kino. Cinema has changed its parameters from mute to the first soundtrack experiences reaching this century surpassing THX already.
Singing in the rain is a colorful testimony of a black and white world gaining voice, a crucial period of adapt or stay aside.
Excelente art direction by the main male character and pal, new techniques of post war first big leap.
It was a time of wonders.
And now we can see the twentieth century's masterpieces restored, colour or not, remastered sound Dolby Digital at least.
Like the version I had the privilege of having seen tonight. Not one but Two, (if not the best musicals ever), this marvelous Singing in the rain and George Cukor's 1964 Pygmalion's Musical, with that magical duo and a quality crew like this more than a decade before.
Every day is a day of wonder at the place where dreams came into being, and so many perish.
Singing in the rain is a song most of the old timers sing from the early youth...
It was an honour seeing it remastered.
Congratulations, it's important to light the bright side to deal with 'stuff'...
Let's congratulate once more.
I never get tired to give praise to those who deserve, named or unnoticed but part of the whole...",9,0,0,25 July 2019
La La Land," À la recherche d'un grand film
","How late and awkward is a review, in a tone of surrender, tainted with delusion and with a touch of personal despair. One can have so many expectations...
I felt betrayed by such an ending. 
I was led to a insane hope in an timeless masterpiece. 
Even those lead roles didn't convinced me. 
At the city of angels gods are expected.
As provincianism may fit the shoe, only after the Oscar ceremony gaffe I begun to understand my feelings about the movie. 
Well, I thought, the winner was a good movie, but...
As a cinema observer, one may put our expectations too high, and I believe that the same has happened with many over the continents. 
So, with a tone of apology, I rest my humble review. 
Soundtrack, Choreographie, lead roles, script, and much more. 
Could It be a cut avoiding that somewhat flavorless finale? Could it be happy happy? 
I must expect such a special Cut. 
To the pursue of the perfect achievement, hail.
Best film among the year's nominees. About hope and romance, dreams that not always come truth, even when they do. 
An outstanding piece of cinematography!",9,1,2,17 September 2018
Kong: Skull Island," Sitting on a plateau over a tumultuous sea
","When you can focus on that view from the island plateau, sensing destiny destroying your bridges and still see everlasting beauty, you can accept that some parts could be discarded but still be a part of the whole. 
It relates with KKong. What else?
It's about greed and ambition, yes it is.
As I see it, all those great fights and insects, all that egotistical unsensibility are there to underline the fact that their unique relation was indestructible and meant to be.
Isn't that what's cinema is all about?
I consider the oeuvre more than a remake. 
Technically impecable. A good thing, not a senseless repetition of already made scenes. 
To those who care about cinema should bring some sense of fulfillment.",8,3,5,19 September 2018
Inception," The top of the hill
","You cannot surpass that kind of forward leap. Historically it constitutes a mark, then you may say, after Inception only a few relevant pieces are there to show. There are undervalued movies like the recent Mortal Engines that lack innovation on a level but offer beautiful takes and effects. But the masterpiece has a deep, intricate, understandable, coherent line of development from start to end. Maybe there are questions unanswered, maybe it is a common place regarding the children, but the ensemble is highly positioned among its pairs. Good arquitecture!",10,0,1,10 February 2019
