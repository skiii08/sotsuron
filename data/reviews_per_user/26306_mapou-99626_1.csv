Hereditary," One of the worst movies I ever saw
","Why do I give it one star? It does not deserve any! All along I kept watching, hoping that at some point something would happen to excuse the non-acting-like-a-real-family/human-beings'-behaviour from actors that I yet respected.The unstitched senario,the lack of a good understandable and followable story, unlike what was depicted in the trailer, and many other little details like the total lack of relevant facts made me put it on pause many times going like 'really?, they must be kidding!'imdb 7,5????? I can't believe it! This is the worst movie I've ever seen since The Neon Demon. Total loss of time! This movie wouldn't have been considered good 40 years ago. It's a shame that somebody thought it would be good in 2018. A shame!!!",1,1,6,28 August 2018
