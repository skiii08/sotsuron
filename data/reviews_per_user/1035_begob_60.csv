The Blair Witch Project," Lost in unreality
","A documentary crew enter the woods to investigate the legend of a local witch, but find themselves in uncharted territory ...Just about my favourite horror. There have been plenty of thoughtful reviews, so I'll leave one idea that I've grown to appreciate over the years.There is a meta theme, raised when the documentary director is challenged for hiding behind the camera: she uses it to filter reality. This is reinforced with her handling of the map even as the crew becomes hopelessly lost. The thought that springs to mind: 'The map is not the territory' - life is not what you expected. Even in the final scene the theme comes through, where the camera belongs to the director, yet her voice is distant - who is behind the camera? That gap within reality gives us a dark and spooky depth.A final point - the tension is largely created by the distress in the voices of the victims. Not once do we hear the voice of the witch. Just victims.10/10.",10,0,0,17 June 2020
Insidious: Chapter 2," Decent, but pulls punches
","Decent ghost story that plays its tricks pretty well. Plenty of jump scares, but nothing outstanding.It's too elaborate to be a classic. You end up with a poltergeist scenario, complete with a detailed 'other side'. In the end the threat is in psychopath human form, which isn't scary - especially since the killer has loads of opportunity to kill yet everyone survives in the end. Plus they add some inappropriate ghostbusters type humour, which really drains the tension even as the climax approaches.The score is good, though not as effective as in the first movie, which opened with an amazing witches' shriek.And the OMG line at the end - most blatant sequel bait of all time?",6,0,0,2 October 2014
Black Swan," Ugly duckling: the angst years
","Anxious dancer strives for perfection. Will she pay a price? And is it melodrama? The story wraps itself around the tragedy of Swan Lake, but replaces love lost with self-regard. Early on a strong note of horror is introduced, with a mysterious doppleganger and very deliberate sound effects. Then comes the decay of personality, with psychotic episodes, and you sense the heroine is not meant for this world.The lead actress exudes anxiety from her poor little face, and even her desperate breathing is conveyed in the rehearsal scenes. Then she makes those mad eyes to camera as the black swan, and you find out later what she's done to earn it. The lead actor adds good authority, and all round the cast plays it well.The music does what you'd expect, with great scenes where the camera circles the dancers, but it's too dramatic during the violent scenes, contrasting with the horror vibe from earlier on.The story feels like a tightrope act by the director, between melodrama and horror, and it comes down on one side. There is a sub-genre in horror of Hollywood wannabe descending into Hell, but this one doesn't fit in. And as a portrait of mental illness it's not quite as good as, say, Magic Magic - maybe because the heroine has the tidy and not so disturbing aim of making a beautiful corpse.Overall, impressive but doesn't hit the spot.",7,0,2,19 May 2015
Come and See," Surprising
","I heard this was a great anti-war film and that it was brutal.Compared to a slasher movie not at all brutal. And I'm not sure it was anti-war, but more a grim picaresque story in the middle of conflict.I loved the stumbling from one bizarre scene to the next. That makes it better than Private Ryan - in that film there's one scene where the soldiers come across a family living on the top floor of a house that's been cut in half, open to the elements, and I remember wishing there were more scenes like it. Come and See is stuffed with that kind of detail, including one with a cow and tracer bullets.Plus there's quite a lot of humour. One brilliant scene is of a group photo near the beginning full of laughter and energy, then a weird sequence with an effigy of Hitler made from a skull, a German police officer who basically acts like a rodeo clown, a dotty old woman who smiles when the killers leave her alive for breeding, and plenty of earthy jokes.So it comes across with a touch of the hallucinations. But then the action scenes are obviously very dangerous for the actors, so that creates a sense of reality. You can see that in the next group scene, when an einsatz squad emerges from the mist to burn down a village. This is the cruellest part of the film, but even then there's great energy and enjoyment amongst the killers - a strange effect.The story is told entirely from the POV of the young hero, and I'm not sure he carries it off completely. There's an awkward scene between him and Glashsa in the first act, where they really force the laughter. But that's OK, doesn't harm the overall effect.The soundtrack is mostly excellent: a constant background of eerie, scratchy noises, and some very effective music.Pity it wasn't shot in widescreen (or did I see a pan & scan version?). The final sequence, while interesting in its reversal of historical scenes, didn't do it for me (although it answers the question, Would you strangle Hitler at birth?), so I should mark it down a point but I won't.This is powerful, and the humour and the two group scenes will stay with me. So it's a 9.",9,4,5,27 October 2014
Resident Evil: Afterlife," Is that any way to treat a girl?
","A super-heroine's assault on an evil corporation is foiled, so she teams up with a desperate group of survivors to battle through a zombie horde and finish the job.Alice continues her quest for Arcadia in a decent addition to the series. The director delivers his usual excellent pace and action set pieces, and the lead actress is always perfect in her icy, fists-on-hips compassion. But the story is a bit diffuse, with too many locations and characters, plus enough gaps in the logic to take you out of the story. Did it need the second strong female? The giant axe-wielding zombie? Nope. And what's with the silver dollars - an appeal to survivalists? Overall, it rolls along with lots of flames and fury, and a few touches of humour, ending in a swirl of optimism and pessimism. For fans only - which includes me.",6,1,3,23 July 2015
It," Brilliant first half
","After his little brother is taken by a ghoulish clown, a teenage boy and his gang of loser friends are threatened by visions of the killer and must uncover the secret past of their town to figure out how to defy him.First instalment of an adaptation of a big, fat novel. I remember reading this way back, finding it a great story while skipping much of the overwritten prose. Then came the mini-series, which was OK but didn't do justice etc. So with all the hype, and budget, and marketing I was expecting this to be a bit bloated, and defanged in a James Wan kind of way.But Woh! The first half is brilliantly rich and balanced. The opening sequence introduces the scares immediately, with a wonderful re-imagining of the clown, including rabbit teeth and a voice that melts from candy to bile. Then the small-town environment is introduced as we meet the characters growing up with the constant threat of bullying and adult oppression. Yet there is some lovely humour over teen awkwardness and young love - one scene has a passionate little fella trudging off with his headphones trailing on the ground. Reminded me of Homer Simpson in his tattered rags. And another where the lads gaze at the sleeping dreamy girl, only to look away when she opens her eyes.So lots of themes and interactions are delivered, interspersed with the frights, and I don't think I've ever been as happy watching a horror movie at the 60 min mark. After that we get a climax, then suck it up and go again for a second final act. This is where the movie reaches for the big set piece, and it works well, not perfectly, with good pacing.One thing that may have been misjudged was the synagogue scene with the strange painting, as it seemed to introduce a religious element that wasn't necessary - perhaps they were laying pipe. Whatever - there is plenty to build on for the next instalment. And one joke I thought they missed: the writing on the cast should have spelled out LOOSER.Acting all round is good, with some stand out performances from the kids - I liked the actors playing Bev and Ben. Photography is good, but a lot depends on CGI despite the early brevity of the fright scenes. The music and sound are lavish but not overwhelming.Overall: Brilliant introduction, plenty to chew on, and hopefully the next one reaches and maintains that standard for the whole movie.",8,1,1,11 December 2017
In Bruges," 'Tis a six
","I hate films that use midgets to make a point. It's something about midgets.This is pretty good, although the absence of laughs felt awkward.What's with Colin Farrell's eyebrows? Like wind-wipers with a jammed motor.I would have enjoyed the contrast between his character and Gleeson's if they both had different philosophies. So the scene in the blood chapel was the crucial bit, but there was nothing outside their selfish concerns.I thought Bruges & Brueghel would inform the characters, maybe set a pattern for them to break, but the actors just reacted to each other like father and son.The love interest was pointless. The film-within had potential, but it just served what turned out to be a melodrama. Fiennes was good as an east-end gangster, but the best performer was Luke Kelly (bell-tower scene): '- On Raglan Road on an autumn day I met her first and knew That her dark hair would weave a snare that I might one day rue; I saw the danger, yet I walked along the enchanted way, And I said, let grief be a fallen leaf at the dawning of the day.'",6,0,3,8 October 2014
Unbreakable," I broke it
","A man who mysteriously survives a train wreck gropes for the purpose of his life after meeting a stranger who sees the fantastic in the ordinary.A superhero story that emphasises the ordinary and mundane, as the hero plods along in the acceptance that his life is failing - from a compromised marriage, awkward fatherhood, and sacrifice of ambition. The anti-hero cuts across this with the insight that cartoon drama is just an exaggeration of the truth and that wonderful things really can happen. Sounds good? I guess, but it's underdeveloped and badly written.The first forty five minutes have excellent cinematography, with the camera moving around the frame in a way that adds so much to the story: the side to side in the train carriage, the depth of perspective in the hospital treatment room, the use of the colosseum stadium etc. It's worth it just for that.But none of the relationships hold up - a physiotherapist wife who never realised her hubbie wasn't really injured in the fateful accident? None of it is true and clear, so the actors have to ham their way through daft dialogue while swelling strings cover up the weakness of the story. I like the idea of bringing hope to the complications of adult life, but the result is juvenile.They missed out one laugh - a scene where the babysitter explains her sister phoned to say she just got a perm that makes her look like ... But the script cut her off. Like Richard Simmons?Overall, the story rides its big production values until it gets swamped.",5,3,5,7 October 2015
Fury," Okay
","Heroic tale of valour in the face of huge odds.The battle scenes in this are great, and the final conflict is legendary. As usual the enemy runs into bullets, while bullets run away from the hero, but it did have an emotional kick.There is moral ambiguity, so it avoids the boredom of goodies v baddies. But the scene in an apartment with a mother and daughter, intended to intensify the characters, doesn't work.Tracer bullets are amazing on screen, but not a single frame of this equals the cow scene in Come And See. The score is full of strong choral stuff, so it gives an epic feel.Overall this needed less of the morals, especially the bible riffs, and more lunacy. I don't think Brad Pitt does lunacy.",6,0,4,3 January 2015
Train to Busan," Moar sombeez
","A dead-beat dad is forced to choose his daughter over his work, but as they settle into their train journey a zombie sneaks aboard ...Bit of a plod as it sets up the emotional stuff, but once the action gets going the story never lets up. This is much better than Snowpiercer, and conveys the zombie satire of society every bit as well as Romero. Plus the emotional moments are truly good. Plenty of humour, but no laughs for me - all in the translation, except the final scene was crying out for a close up on the sniper's face as he heard the singing.Performances are good, with an impressive turn by the little girl.Music, editing - good. And the pile-on effects with zombie corpses were effective.Overall: Good zombiness.",7,1,2,4 March 2017
The Maze Runner," Great pace and shallowness
","The pace of this is great - the scenes join up like a sprint relay, with the tension mounting all the time.The characters were fairly well marked out, although the introduction of the girl showed the lack of ambition of the story - that should have caused some funny reactions amongst a group of 50 sex starved boys. The only faint laugh was the 'girls are awesome' scene.The ending is sequel bait, but at least it left you guessing. Even to the point you wonder if the hero is really a plant.Lack of humour is a weakness throughout. The scenario is interesting. But the big failing is that in that kind of world the future will not be technological - more feudal.",6,1,2,1 December 2014
Dawn of the Dead," Perfect
","An overworked nurse kicks back after her tiresome shift, only to find next morning her world has turned into the zombie apocalypse. How will she survive?Perfect horror. The opening sequence is a master class in movie making, mixing tension with enjoyable character, and when we pitch into the main story the simple dialogue and performances keep the show going with wonderful pace. And after a hectic climax we're treated to the greatest end-credits ever.Plenty of gore and gun-blasting, but always humour - especially through the music - and so many character arcs and pay-offs from the excellent writing. Also a healthy dose of satire on religion.I come to praise. But there is a mystery - the director and writer joined the Hollywood clown show after this, so how did they come up with such brilliance in the first place? Logically, it must be Romero's influence as co-writer, but I don't buy that. (ps. The script was re-written by two uncredited writers.)Overall: thankful it got made, however it got made - as enjoyable to re-watch as Jaws and The Shining.",10,2,4,6 September 2016
Star Trek Into Darkness," Dumb
","A reckless young battleship commander hunts down the assassin of his mentor, but needs the assassin's help to counter a threat from within.Flashy action story with a confused concept. The opening sequence addresses the clash between the ethics of the organisation and the swashbucklng of our hero, but it makes a mockery of the thoughtful side of Star Trek and doesn't tie in with the rest of the plot. After that we're left with something like Top Gun - a barely disguised homage to American military might without any insight on the responsibilities of power or the potential of human collaboration. There is nothing to explain how the organisation could become so corrupted that it promotes war, and the threat from the villain seems to come from nowhere - I don't know much about the Star Trek universe, so I'm just commenting on the internal logic of the story, but the year 1945 seems to have significance.The drama is limited, with simple-minded relationships, and the actors don't need to do much. Best performances are from the villain, with the usual icy British superiority, and a bit of steam rising from Uhuru's passion.The director fits the pieces together fairly tight and throws in plenty of punch-ups, but there's not much of interest.Overall: nothing to distinguish this from a dumb action movie.",6,2,3,6 June 2017
The Babadook," Not a horror
","This shouldn't have been pitched as a horror. It's a study in the developing psychosis of a poor single mother with an ungovernable child.The pace is slow, colours mostly drained and grey, and the mood is depressing. The two main characters are sympathetic, especially the boy who is played really well. I actually had a twinge of concern for the actor at one point, wondering if it was appropriate to have an adult screaming at him. The other characters were poorly drawn and didn't really fit in. Why have two social workers instead of one, why was the babadook in the parkinson's lady's house, why wasn't the sister involved in the end? None of them really matters to the story.So after an hour you have a story perfectly consistent with a depressed woman under pressure who begins to have hallucinations and poses a threat to her child. Why not play that out?Instead we get a flimsy supernatural intervention and a tacked on ending to what was a realistic story. By that point the child's behavioural problems have been externalised after a couple of nights on sedatives, and the mother has switched to full blown mental collapse after being infected by The Thing in the shadows. Bit of a mess, really - although I did enjoy the twist where the boy ties his mother up to save her.Some of the sound was good. I liked the moaning wind. The shadows were good, and the time lapse on the mother's face under the sheet as night passed was impressive.ps. Thanks to nybred4 for the anagram of the title. I hadn't twigged that - doh! Is nybred an anagram?pps. Interesting link of a psychological review - I'll have to watch again: http://the-artifice.com/the-babadook-mental-illness/",4,24,60,16 November 2014
The Girl Next Door," Overpriced
","Goody goody student perverts sex into profit.The deep depravity of the Reaganite fairytale. This looks like an update of Ferris Bueller, but fails at every level - zero laughs, zero innocence. And the story telling is poor.At about halfway I checked to see how much time was left - always a bad sign - and there were still 50 mins to go. Ouch.High production value and good acting, but so many jokes missed, so much irony ignored. The romance didn't matter to the story at all, so there you have it: people are just c^nts and pr*cks that come at a price - lovely.Plus 1 for the soundtrack, but we really need to reject this sh*t.",2,2,5,24 April 2015
Don Jon," Not a dime
","Boy finds the girl of his parents' dreams. Then a woman finds him.Interesting rom-com that doesn't lead the laughs home. The best moment was when he interrupted his singing to a gay song as his car came to a halt next to some girls. There's lots of structure and repetition, and you can see how it might work on paper, so I guess the miss is down to the direction.Wonderful actors, but Moore and Headly should have had more developed characters. The sister was interesting - always withdrawn to her phone screen, then delivers a word of reality. I liked that, but didn't she have problems similar to her brother? The highlight was Johansson in an icy/steamy role.Pace was fine, music whimsical.Always a bad sign when you start discussing the actors. Still, it was good - but not that good.",6,1,2,2 July 2015
Midnight in Paris," An American optimist in Paris
","On a vacation in Paris with his fiancée a dissatisfied writer finds the ability to step back in time to the 1920s literary heyday of that city and explores his passions ...Amusing fantasy that relies on the good natured sweetness of its lead actor. The conceit is nice, although the set pieces with the famous figures of the past didn't make me laugh out loud. The main themes are wrapped up well - nostalgia inducing a sense of grass-is-always-greener and the responsibility of art to overcome despair - while the pacing helps achieve a lightness of touch.The lead actor does channel the Woody Allen persona, but there's nothing whiny in his performance and he delivers a very likable romantic hero. Other performances are good, Kathy Bates being the standout, but nothing remarkable. The streets and architecture of the city add great charm, and the director obviously has a tourist's love of the sheen of the cobblestones in the rain.Music is mostly Cole Porter.Overall: Upbeat and airy, a gentle comedy.",7,0,0,26 June 2017
Pan's Labyrinth," Disappointing
","I think this is two fairy tales - one tells the story of the heroine's three tasks in Pan's labyrinth, and the other the fight between good communists and bad fascists. In the end the final task corresponds with the defeat of the fascists.The production and acting are very good, the fantasy scenes are imaginative, and overall it's good to watch. The only violence I had problems with was the amputation scene - had to turn away. I had a problem with a couple of plot points- the heroine breaks the rules, which seems out of character for her + as a consequence Pan says the game's up, but then returns to give her another chance. The second bit does get resolved, but it bugged me.The story's not really satisfying because it's a total fairy tale - no true insight for the audience. Plus it seems to me the heroine's completion of her fantasy tasks produces the kind of hierarchical system that the goodies have been fighting against in the other fairy tale. So that makes it politically naive.I hadn't watched this before because it's subtitled + had a reputation for being weird. I wish it had been genuinely weird.",5,3,6,31 August 2014
Shutter Island," Unconvincing
","The first half of this movie is a fantasy, which gets solved in the second half by old-fashioned psychological here's-what-really-happened.The lead looks too fresh to carry off the tragic role, and some of his delivery of the cartoonish lines is really poor (although may not be his fault). The fantasy part is half-baked with some clumsy clues, and then we get memories of the holocaust to illuminate the hero's past. Was that really necessary? I was thinking Jacob's Ladder, but I didn't like that either and it was a better movie than this.The figuring-out part is like an '80s Hercules Poirot episode - neither scary nor emotive, just flipping over the cards as it suits the dealer. On top of his holocaust experience, the hero also had a mad homicidal wife. Bloody hell! The final flashback is awkward, and there's no effort to make us hurt for the children. The ending is ... 'led off in handcuffs'. Duh duh duuuuh! Way too elaborate for a simple story.",4,4,6,19 August 2014
Interstellar," Faith in the unpossible
","Ooo - what a disappointment. I expected something new, not this.I was looking for back story on the state of the climate, but it didn't come. Doubt set in when the exploration theme was raised, with the teacher denying the moon landing. Totally out of left-field, nothing to do with the story. Then the hero turns up at the NASA base - I know it's not random and that this thing loops back on itself, but it just felt odd rather than intriguing.Then the main theme is set up - love may be the ultimate survival adaptation. But they did nothing with it.Then we're through the wormhole, but the story shows almost total lack of curiosity about this new environment. No real attempt to present strange worlds. A big wave in ankle deep water - fair enough. A frozen planet - uuuh, Norway?At this point I was hungry for a bit of action. And we did get treachery - clearly flagged (no touchy my computer) - leading to a ... punch up. Exciting.The end is nice and safe, with double-optimism all around. But don't mention the fact we're already running out of cheap oil. Without that the best we can manage is inter-village hog barter with hand-crank shower units. Do I lack faith?",5,4,7,1 February 2015
American Hustle," Lots of energy, but dull
","I was looking forward to this. The hype made it look like a banker for entertainment, but it mostly fails to deliver.Lots of comic elements, but they don't gel. Some stuff was amusing, but I think the only laugh I got was when the FBI agent was told not to eat in the bathroom. You can sense the actors' lack of conviction.The promise of violence was not delivered on - they copped out with a simple The Sting type deception. You don't invite his holiness De Niro into your house and expect him to leave quietly. I suppose that's because it's partly based on a true story.The conman is too subdued, the FBI agent too demented. Why the heart pills? Random. Most interesting character is Rosalyn, who resents her life and delivers perfect self-justifying lines. She has a nice scene where she fears she'll die before she changes, but it's hard to like her.The ambiguity over politics and money is an interesting slant, but I didn't get anything from it.The final pay off is middle class respectability. Zzzzz.",5,0,1,21 September 2014
Nightcrawler," Mostly excellent
","First Gyllenhal movie I've enjoyed - he does a lot of interesting stuff and directors clearly prefer him, but I find him dull.This time he plays a vicious character who escapes justice - and yet someone we approve of. Really engaging story.Great to see Renee Russo again - face a little heavy, but still a babe. I would have enjoyed the end of her story, but the editors chickened out.Overall the themes were substantial, and the corporate cynicism summed up how we live today: a bullying negotiation. Good guys are always on the ballot, but we keep voting for the psychos.Pace was spot on. Music spot on.",8,1,2,5 December 2014
The Last Legion," Doesn't add up
","The infant emperor of Rome turns to a faithful legionnaire to rescue him from captivity and assist his flight to a far off land ...The story is based on a novel, which I bet was plenty fat. There is a huge amount of history and incident packed into a very slim 105m run time, to the point where our heroes survey a snowy Alpine pass for a moment before a map-montage of Transalpine Gaul flashes up to represent their epic journey to Britannia, where they conveniently step to shore from a boat. And it turns out this is a prequel to a very famous myth, promoted to the status of legend by its Roman associations.So the story is hugely ambitious but with only a fraction of the resources needed to deliver a satisfying production. At least that's the way it feels, yet it has a stellar cast and a huge budget. And the script is by a renowned playwright, and some of the locations are interesting (especially the recreation of the Isle of Capri). Something doesn't add up.It's not just that the dialogue is painfully plain, but the editing and writing keeps hurrying us along through what should be a fascinating land of oddities and magical encounters. For some reason the story is coy about magic, only hinting that it's anything more than a clever hoax, and the climactic battle is extras in a field spinning and kicking and roaring, while the showdown with the nemesis opens with a 'startled!' sound effect as a little girl looks around and ... he's there! Just bizarrely bad. I imagine the screenplay came in at 180 pages, and the producer said, 'Great - cut it in half. With a sword.'The cast do OK with stiff lines, and the actress with the amazing blue eyes has less difficulty convincing us she's the unlikeliest all-action knife twirler than that she enjoys any chemistry with the glum leading man. The music is lavish orchestral stuff, but no big deal.Overall: Interesting concept, underwhelming delivery.",5,2,6,18 October 2017
Split," Splat
","A troubled girl is kidnapped by a strange man and must reveal her past in the struggle to escape.Standard captive-captor plot enlivened by a fascinating conceit over multiple personalities, and well performed by the lead actors. Almost two hours long, but it flies by at great pace despite the mostly claustrophobic sequences. The story is well put together, but it's not a horror and nowhere near as creepy as the director's last outing in The Visit. Nor does it give its violent moments real life, which is typical of this director. Only three characters, with the minor parts badly underwritten, and mostly it's a two-hander with an interesting antagonism. A few plot holes, and a couple of implausible plot points involving locks. In the end the director adds a decent twist, but then he reveals his ambition and I was left shrugging my shoulders.I looked forward to the lead actor's performance after his showing in Scum, and he does really well, but the lightweight mood drains his power, and the whole thing falls way short of, say, the basement scenes in Silence Of The Lambs. The lead actress is very good in close up.Music is atmospheric but laid on too thick, especially over some dialogue scenes that should have been more powerful with simple delivery. Photography is good, and the editing and writing keep up an excellent pace.Overall: fascinating premise, but the director wimps out on the horror.",7,2,10,24 March 2017
Knowing," Nonsense on stilts
","Wow - a movie that's crazier than Nicholas Cage. Someone should make a movie about it.Can't believe I'm saying this, but he's too restrained, especially in the relationship with his son - cold and bossy. There should have been an early scene where they have fun with numbers and science, and that could have been mirrored in the parting scene at the end.I guess it's Noah's Ark dressed up in bogus sci-fi. A serious film would have taken on the issue of determinism full frontal, but this is just a fairy tale.I reckon it's 20 mins too long, and snort-laugh overblown. But watchable.Best thing about it? The Beethoven at beginning and end.",4,3,5,17 January 2015
The Orphanage," Powerful ending
","A wife returns with her husband and child to live at the old orphanage from which she was adopted, but the secrets of the past return to haunt her family ...A tragic tale that delivers not just on ghostly menace but on pathos and humanity too. A slow build up is punctuated with a few effective jump scares, but the story changes gear during an imaginative treasure hunt and comes to its climax with near perfection.The plot is a little underdeveloped, leaving the odd hole, and some of the dialogue is misjudged - especially in a Q&A scene at about 40 mins - but all that is forgiven as the director brings it home on a wave of emotion.The performances are good, and the lead actress is outstanding: not just fascinating in close-up but a treat for the eyes as well.Music was sometimes too playful - in a horror that can be a sign of the director losing his nerve, but it didn't spoil the tone. Photography was good, with beautiful locations and a stylish circling pan of the actress in a crucial scene towards the end.Overall: a little shaky, but a pleasure for even seasoned horrorists.",8,0,3,17 November 2016
Shrek Forever After," Perfectish joy
","Beautiful story, told brilliantly.I saw the first movie years ago, but hadn't followed the series. This is even better than the original.Everything about it hits the mark. Pace, character, humour, setbacks, tension. If there's a standout it's the hilarious Puss in Boots.A few tiny reservations. Animation for the dance scenes could be even better - the witches rave is an awesome idea and should blow the roof off. Overall there should have been some darker touches in the music selection. About halfway through the tension slacks off a nudge, I think because it feels like the Kiss is inevitable - but they pile on the trouble after that and nothing is certain.Huge entertainment. I luvsed it.",10,1,1,27 February 2015
X-Men: Days of Future Past," ... off a penguin's p*ss

Wolverine shows some humour when he turns up in lava-lamp world, but what are Stewart and McKellen doing but picking up their pay chegues? So so depressing. There are thousands of better movies produced on pennies compared to this thing.

The Conjuring 2," Wholesome Christian fun
","A ghostbusting couple decides to give it a rest after a demon comes too close, but are drawn irresistibly across the Atlantic by the cries for help from an English family haunted by the spirit of an old man, where things get even closer.Hectic story that rolls out all the tricks to reasonable effect. While Wan does put bums on seats, he's considered a bit safe and does the expected here. But there is some edge to this standard story of puberty possession, with violent entities piercing through the shadows with demonic intent. Early on the scares come through sound jumps, but the visual weirdness takes over and delivers some good stuff.The acting is good, particularly the wife. There is one afterthought scene before the third act, which starts with a false line about taking the music away and develops into a decent tribute to Elvis while failing to deliver any horror effect. That's probably the biggest blip in the pacing of a story that doesn't have enough psychological strength or coherent demon myth to outrun 100 mins.The Christian angle would be nauseating, except there's no sincerity and it fizzles out with maudlin reassurance for the teen audience.The English accents are from drama school, although there is a fair attempt at setting the contemporary scene from 1977 - not sure Maggie called herself the Iron Lady until two years later.Sound design early on was interesting, but after that it's mostly Scorsese-style dropping in of popular old tunes that sets the tone.Overall, more robust from Wan but still safe as houses.

Tropic Thunder," Swallow the gravy
","Flaccid early on (director's cut), but it comes good.Best performance was by the little drug lord - amazing aggression in his face. Tom Cruise busts a move, but still white bread. Couldn't understand much of Downey's dialogue. Stiller reprises his mock-nobility from Zoolander.The story could have gone anywhere, so it's a wild ride. The major characters do find satisfaction in the end, but the lack of rhythm in the laughs makes it fall short.Overall it probably needed vile humour, but the target audience wouldn't have that I guess. Is that ironic?",6,0,0,20 February 2015
Inside Out," Slightly grim, slightly funny
","A young girl's emotions set out on a rescue mission when she becomes increasingly sad following her family's move to the big city to start a new life.Disney brings the concept of the Numskulls to a new level. The animation explores a sometimes nightmarish world, where a simplified set of emotions is personified in a team of bumbling characters that negotiates a landscape of threatening imagination and cold, industrialised memory processes.The pace is pretty good, with an escalating roller-coaster ride of challenges and defeats as the emotions struggle to restore the girl to her vibrant happy self, only to find another self is emerging. This kept veering into a darker narrative, and I guess the writers constantly had to push back into more wholesome territory with the girl's personal story overwhelmed by the more hectic experiences of team emotion.Editing and performances are good, and the music hardly noticeable. Some decent laughs, but nothing great. Best scene is in the memory dump.Overall, good and imaginative with a satisfying ending, but the plot maybe lacks a bit of drive as the link between the trauma of the move and the growing sadness lacks some truth and difficulty. I suppose this comes through in the upbeat preachiness and downbeat interference, respectively, of the characters Joy and Sadness.",7,1,19,22 February 2016
Resident Evil," The need to feed
","Woman rages against the machine, but the machine won't stand for rage.Lovely resistance movie. After 13 years it's still crisp and pacey. Two great close-up actresses, Jovovich and Rodriguez, and the director/writer knows just how to use those images and the music to keep the rhythm going.The story is good and clear, and the theme of humanity betrayed by the corporate collective is even more urgent today. Not a great movie, but still has a lot to say, and it gets me every time - I guess time will tell.I suppose the CGI is the only thing that ages it, but trying to update this with superior tech would be pointless.Overall, great entertainment.",9,4,7,31 May 2015
The Grand Budapest Hotel," One laugh
","Oh noes. I was looking forward to this.It creates a charming world, the production is great, big name actors.But I got just one laugh, and that was in the trailer - when the concierge said to the police, 'I knew there was something fishy', and ran away.It's basically a Mel Brooks comedy - clever, self-conscious, increasingly absurd, but deep down ideological. Plus the music is always arch, turning every scene into a cartoon.Ralph Fiennes was brilliant at first, but the cunning of his concierge became less important as the story went on, when I was expecting more. And although it became a bit gay and join-hands-together, there was no interesting female role.The Nazi slant in the end may have been necessary, but weren't the nasty relatives sufficient?ps. I had no idea Tilda Swinton was in the cast.",6,3,6,19 September 2014
It Follows," Kuhreepyish
","Teen catches a deadly curse from a deceptive lover, and her friends help her flee a relentless pursuit by random malevolent weirdos.Where to start? This has got a big reaction, but nobody can figure it out.Most striking thing is the music - lots of background radiation, then big '80s synth vibe. I loved it, although it often stands in for action and pace.Production and performances were good. Strangely coy in the sex scenes, given that sex was the transmission mechanism. And no real reflection on love. I didn't get the scene on the lake with three men in a boat - did I miss something? On the horror ... The notion of a mysterious, distant figure pursuing with malevolent intent goes back to MR James. Some say the infection element is a metaphor for sexual promiscuity. Meh. Others think the references to Dostoevsky and Eliot show alienation, with the quotes addressing death without consolation.I'll tell you: American youth lost in the decay of their society brought about through decades of voodoo economics. Up yours, baby boom-fckers. Maybe that's the point of the film - read into it what you want. But it is striking how many indie horrors from the US use the crumbling built environment for locations - this is set in the bankrupt municipalities of Michigan.Overall a spooky film that relies too much on its soundtrack but makes ya fink. But not spooky enough, so I give it a 6.",6,12,28,7 May 2015
Get Out," Guess who?
","On a visit to his white girlfriend's parents a black guy finds his hosts have more than just a few awkward moments planned for him ...Well paced thriller, with some creepy moments and a fair amount of gore, but not a real horror. The set up is nice and snappy, and we settle into a weekend that escalates from social antagonism to outright exploitation. The mood is developed through the alienated existence of the weird black characters, and there's plenty material on the theme of race, but the whole thing is let down by a ludicrously elaborate plot. There are echoes of the disturbing Skeleton Key, but this experience falls short by comparison.The performances are solid, most memorable being from the actress playing the maid, who delivers some genuine weirdness. One character designed for comic relief is too deliberate, and fails to fit in to the plot at the very end. Direction and photography are good, and the music is cool.Overall: well told story, but the concept is over the top.",7,2,5,5 June 2017
Ex Machina," God is dead
","Alcoholic Google ... ooops, search engine creator invites wannabe genius to test his robot and see if it can pass for real.I've read a bit about the Turing test, so this seemed to fit the bill of serious sci-fi where people try to adapt to new technology. The opening sequence is great story telling, and the drama that follows is pretty good, with twists and deceptions all the way.The photography is amazing, and the director does some beautiful things with perspective and lighting and mirrors. And the acting is good. Plus a surreally smooth stabbing.The problem I had with it is slack pace and tension. I did look at my watch a few times.Is this about AI, or the successful completion of an elaborate programme? Sadly, Benedict Cumberbatch killed himself in The Imitation Game, so we might never know.Maybe Her is better sci-fi, because it addresses the singularity.",6,0,2,15 May 2015
Evil Dead," Relentless until it stumbles
","The best review for this was by Admarple on p.48.I'll just add that this movie is relentless horror until a complete switch of tone at about 75 mins - the mood music goes all violins and we end up with a different hero. I suspect the producers overruled the director. So the Three Labours of Hercules (MacGyver style) that had been set earlier in the movie went to the sister instead of the brother. Basically turned into a chick flick, with a Caravaggio chainsaw slaughter at the end.Not sure it was worth remaking, even with a more grim/less camp approach - nothing really original added, although the addiction rehab was a good idea that didn't have time to develop. And the blond was mysteriously pointless - did she die? I forget.I was thinking 7/10 halfway through, but it ended up as a 5.",5,2,2,16 August 2014
The Imitation Game," How is that not like talking
","Entertaining, but it spreads itself too thin.This man's life seems very complex, and the film touches on a lot of difficult themes without nailing them.The story of breaking the cypher is well done, with the right degree of set-back and struggle. The eureka sequence is good, although the celebration of their success is uninspired. What follows is full of potential, as the deceptiveness of the state crushes the individual. I wish they'd tied this in with Turing's view on violence. How would that reflect on war, on the winners of the war? How does Turing's statistical approach affect our notions of good and evil? Serious stuff.But instead of an anti-war film they gave us a tragic tale of bigotry, and it peters out with his sad life.Not being too critical. It's just a difficult story to handle.Apart from that the two leads play really well together. There are a few bum notes. The joke he didn't get wasn't a joke. Knightley doesn't really seem to help with the code breaking. And the 'deep' line about those we least expect is used like a sledgehammer. ps. His intro to cryptography is a nice observation on subtext. Careful talk costs lives - there's your irony.",7,1,5,7 January 2015
From Dusk Till Dawn," Second thoughts on re-watch
","Two brothers flee for the border after robbing a bank and slaughtering a bunch of cops, but their only way through is by hijacking a family of doubting christians, and across the border a worse fate lies in store.Real sloppy comedy horror, where the laughs are fairly thin. Lots of good elements, but they don't come together, and you can tell this was an opportunity grasped by film-makers who still didn't know what they were about.It's fun to see so many good actors, but the characters aren't up to their talent, and Clooney is way too clean cut. The director doesn't have the skill of the screenwriter, and the screenwriter seemed more interested in getting his big face on film.Amusing gore, but the comedy beats are off and the pace drags. Music was surprisingly tame too.Overall, a great title with nice ideas, but it doesn't work.",5,1,3,14 July 2015
Prisoners," Snakes in my brain
","153 mins. Why?The opening sequence is joyful. I got a laugh when black dad couldn't play the trumpet, and the kids were happy. Then the disturbing disappearance.It's intense, it's elaborate. But it's just an extended episode of a cop show - and there's loads of unrealistic scenes where the cop investigates on his own. That's denial of pension rights there.One great thing is the performance of aunt Holly, but the director cut it short. What about a chase scene where a lithe granny outshoots a dull detective? Never seen that before.And one great irony was the torture of the child-man by the desperate parents - how could they ignore this in the end of the story? Nuts.I've read great stuff about this director, but it felt ordinary (except for the snake thing - like the spider in Enemy?).",5,4,6,28 November 2014
Elysium," Revolting
","Unimaginative crack at how capitalism tends toward tyranny. So you get gang-bangers v billionaires.Almost every scene raises the question, 'But how come ...?'Why human workers when there are robots? If there's enough energy supply for a giant space station, why isn't there wealth on earth, where the supply comes from? Maybe it's like Saudi Arabia. Why don't the billionaires all have the defensive force-field the mercenary have? Why that Sid Ifrikin iksint?I'm sympathetic to the message, because we have a version of this story developing now with the adolescent politics of right-libertarianism: I can do it on my own and I don't need anyone else - because I'm worth it (especially when I rig the political and monetary system in my favour).There are much better ways of telling the story.And Jodie Foster's take on Christine Lagarde is not magnifique.",4,11,19,29 September 2014
Sinister," Dextrous Sinister
","Very effective haunted house story.The soundtrack plays a big part, but without being obvious. The suspense is very strong, and I got to a point where I dreaded what was coming next - uncomfortable to watch. The acting was good throughout, and there are several good jump scares.It takes about 40 mins to confirm the supernatural element - up to then it's a serial killer investigation. Then there's an element of the protagonist losing his mind, and eventually the spirits are revealed. After that point some of the sinister element was lost, and I definitely could have done without Mr Boogie in the flesh - much better when he was a crude image in the background. If you judge a horror by the final effect, then this disappoints as the final scenes felt like a relief from the creepiness that went before.A few other weaknesses. It's a little too long, should have come in under 100 mins. Second the son's night terrors don't tie into the plot, and he's almost forgotten after the first hour. Some reviewers couldn't get past the decision to stay in the house, and the constant darkness, but that was OK for me and created a claustrophobic atmosphere.",7,0,0,20 September 2014
The Fountain," Bit slow for me
","Well, I thought this must be by del Toro, because structure and tone is similar to Pan's Labyrinth and the strong Spanish element. But no.I prefer this since it leaves us with a reflection on life and death rather than the simple tying together of fairy tales.There's plenty of repetition of imagery and scenes, and the music is well done throughout. The acting was good, although not much for Weisz to get her teeth into, and some of the barging through the lab was a bit scenery chewing. Problem for me was the pace - it didn't really keep my attention, even with the short running time.",6,1,3,17 February 2015
Zombieland," Twee
","I tried to watch this before, but gave up after a half hour (at about the Hummer point) because the voice-over, with its twee rules, was so annoying.It really does narrate stuff that's already on screen. Why? WHY? And is so self-satisfied I wanted zombie jaws to clench on the narrator's windpipe.There were some laughs to break up my long sighs of boredom. All delivered by Harrelson, then Murray. Apart from that it's children running wild, and nobody gets hurt.For me comedy-horror is horror laced with comedy. Black jokes, black irony. When Plymouth Rock lands on us. For others it's the absurdity of ordinary things getting out of control.This is just Scooby Doo.",2,6,12,21 February 2015
Joker," They're not laughing now ...
","In a city seething with class antagonism, the mental illness of a struggling clown flourishes into messianic and murderous insanity.Woah! That's a bold story, and the lead role does it justice, as the character becomes a sort of hall-of-mirrors reprise of Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver, with uncanny poses and dance moves. And of course, de Niro is present too, with shades of The King Of Comedy.But you can see the problem right there, with all the emphasis on the actors and not so much on story or theme. It is engaging, and well paced and edited, but a bit linear and simplistic. Maybe comic book heroes are fit only for comic books, and expecting them to take on the injustices of the American Way is to ask too much. At least they had the guts to go for it.On reflection, I think maybe the concept started in too low a gear - if you state that we live in a crazy, mixed-up system, the audience is already with you. What we really want to see is the dawning of the Age of Joker, as the mantra Life Is A Joke infects everything, even the most innocent thing, until we realise Joker is an inevitable outgrowth of the jokers who run this system.The sound is very good, with a constant hubbub of tinny TVs, the guy in the apartment upstairs shouting, 'Shut up!', and the din of Gotham's chaotic streets. Also, the music keeps reminding you of Sinatra's genius for hitting unexpected notes that are just right. Most interesting part of the cinematography is the giant architecture.Overall: Interesting, not awesome.ps. The best line is a clever gag nicked from Bob Monkhouse: 'When I was growing up I told them I wanted to become a comedian. They laughed at me then ....'",7,2,3,3 February 2020
Edge of Tomorrow," Good stuff
","Good Groundhog Day concept, set in a European war against invading aliens.It started out undercooked. We got a quick exposition by network news montage, then a really implausible dilemma for the hero, which was made worse by an unbelievably relaxed military base on the eve of a D-Day style invasion.Lots of details got me thinking that would never happen, never! At this point it felt like the whole thing was held together with sticky tape.The invasion sequence is Saving Private Ryan all over again, but not so much. And then ... the concept kicks in, and it becomes a great story, There's plenty of humour, but it's all gogogo action and the pace hardly flags. The aliens are menacing, better than Starship Trooper.The acting was good, although I think Gleeson was miscast, and the rag-tag troops are a bit lightweight. The hero goes from glib coward to determined saviour, but there's nothing to show why (rather than how) he clicks into action.I know some things have to be glossed over, but there's no explanation of how the rogue troops sneaked off base with a hulking great airplane for the final mission.So I mark it down to 7 for that, but still very enjoyable.",7,0,2,6 September 2014
Whiplash," Sweaty duel
","I once sat at a full drum kit with the sticks in hand. Couldn't do a thing. Completely daunted.So this is an overcoming-obstacles melodrama. I know that because the hero not only survived a driver's side t-bone collision with a truck but then raced to the concert with blood dripping from his scalp.For that reason I can't take this film as seriously as many other reviewers.The story is taut and focuses so heavily on pupil and teacher that the other characters don't get much of a look in. Everything looks and sounds good, and I liked the abrupt ending.Usually this kind of thing is heart-warming, but this one aimed for brutal oneness. It succeeded, but I was expecting something more than a duel and a Buddy Rich speed contest.",6,0,2,12 January 2015
"Hail, Caesar!"," Romans before slaves
","Two days in the life of a fixer-producer for a Hollywood studio, when he's confronted with the potential scandal of a pregnant starlet, having to shoe-horn a rodeo clown into the lead part in a sophisticated drama, and - worst of all - recovering his biggest star from the clutches of kidnappers before the production of Hail Caesar collapses.Quality comedy that could have done with a bit more edge. Not laugh-a- minute, but there are some great scenes - the stand out is the tap- dancing sailors who, after lamenting the prospect of life at sea without dames, are told they're 'gonna have to beat it'. Also the scene where the religious leaders squabble over the depiction of Jesus in film.Lots of nice performances in mostly nod-'n-wink gags about the period. The lead plays a similar role to that in Inherent Vice. But strangely Johansson makes another underpowered pop-up appearance.Looks superb and sounds good. Big themes too - capitalism, communism, Marxism, Christianity speaking truth to power, the choice between creation and destruction. As usual the Coens give plenty to chew over in the way they dramatise the intellectual content.Overall, a bit short - could have done with tying all the plot lines together in a mind boggling maze of insanity. Plus I would have preferred more of a noir vibe, with some real menace. But it's a good movie and doesn't deserve all the criticism thrown its way.",8,2,4,1 August 2016
1408," Cusack, Jackson ... Yay! But give it a miss
","Alcoholic writer expects everyone to put up with his hallucinations. Yes, another Stephen King story.Overall it's corny, but with some genius weird moments + way too many bloviations. In the end, nothing is explained. But we do get the sentimental back story - Daddy, do you still love me? - and the long suffering wife (very beautiful).I haven't enjoyed a King story since I was fourteen years old, but he clearly adapts brilliantly to cinema. IMDb loves that prison movie ... you know, the one I think is just OK.The pace was really off - at 40 mins I wondered how much further the story could go without a swift end. Eventually it slacked off to give a contrast of reality, but always with the sense we'd get back to the hallucinations. Which we did, but minus any twist or wit.I got the sense Cusack was trying to sophisticate this up - he mentioned Kafka and looked like a puffy drunk. And what about Jackson in the final funeral scene? Appearance fee? Watchable because of Cusack - but no scares, no jumps, no insight.",4,1,2,9 September 2014
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Fairly good
","On vacation in Spain two American girlfriends meet a tall, dark and handsome artist who satisfies their needs in unexpected ways.A curious little romance that putters along until about the halfway mark, when the introduction of a new character adds some tension and darkness. The sensibility is middle class - safe and responsible - so nothing really dramatic is promised and the story resolves on a minor note: not too comfortable, restrained in emotion.The performances are good, particularly from the ex-wife. Locations are idyllic. Music is gorgeous. Only complaint is the odd voice-over of the narrator, which lords it over the story and is very much tell-don't-show.Overall: fairly interesting, fairly engaging.",7,1,1,6 October 2017
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," Ouch
","A single woman is adored by idiot film-makers.Poor romantic propaganda - and then we have to put up with Clive Owen too. Curses! And I have yet to see a good recreation of the Spanish Armada.This story is stuffed with Anglo bolloxology and completely fails to get to the heart of an amazing person. Blanchett plays the role well, but Elizabeth was a swat and a bitch + none of the humour of her privileged life comes across.Plus Burghley was the major influence on her life, not the totalitarian Walsingham. I'm getting too specific. But Clive Owen? Pshaw!",4,2,2,14 June 2015
Jojo Rabbit," Free the Rabbit-Hutch One!
","An earnest boy in a comically violent society finds himself in a dilemma when he discovers one of the enemy a bit too close to home.Unusual comedy that swings between Gunther Grass and Mel Brooks, with a touch of Terry Gilliam, but finds its own peculiar rhythm. I think its main strength is in taking familiar aspects of the end of the war in Germany and giving them a unique angle. As for the comedy, plenty of fruitful set pieces. but only one genuine scream of a laugh just before the final scene. And there is a very touching scene involving shoes and a gallows.Thematically, the only disappointment is that it didn't nail the lie of race - while it impishly mocked Aryanism and Aryan notions of Jewishness, it shied away from Jewish biblicalism.There are some problems with the casting, because they use a few known comedians who aren't really film actors, and the lead actor starts off a little wobbly before hitting his stride. Even so, the imaginary friend device works perfectly. Otherwise, the performances are very good, with Rockwell the pick of the bunch.There is the novelty, for me, of two famous songs performed in German by the original artists, and overall the soundtrack is excellent, not obtrusive. The cinematography is fine, with the Czech urban locations dominating the visual feast.Overall: light touch on a heavy subject, but the only true movie on this subject remains Come And See.ps.for fans of J-horror, I think there was a Ju-on joke in there, but it didn't quite work.",8,1,3,9 February 2020
Looper," Good, a bit muddled
","Terminator meets Witness.If you don't think too hard about the time travel conundrum this is good entertainment.Once you accept the premise it cracks along at a good pace. It's a violent America, where people shoot for little reason and speed through the streets, forcing pedestrians to leap out of the way. And for some reason, in a technologically advancing world, gold and silver are the currency.The pace slacks off when Bruce Willis turns up from thirty years in the future. His younger self, Gordon Levitt (very convincing as a confident hit-man) then morphs into the older man, although about half way through he does a Mickey Rourke impression.There are two fine blonds in this, which was overkill. And a scary little boy, who does great angry faces.One thing I didn't understand - why did the older Seth disintegrate as he was racing to make the date mysteriously etched on his forearm? You could say the same thing is happening to Bruce too, but not in this movie.",7,0,1,15 September 2014
What We Do in the Shadows," Nice one
","A bit gentle in the first half, when the vampires might as well be a gang of goths. The funniest bits were the fight over the dishes and the werewolf hassle. After that the vampire powers kick off and it's consistently good with lovable characters. The fight scenes reminded me of the karate in Team America, and the scenes with the police made me crack up.Pity the slave doesn't have a bigger part - maybe an extended interview broken up through the narrative. Reminded me of a Catherine Tate character (airport arrivals in a Burke). Plus I'd love a scene where social welfare call around to interrogate them about their income - incompetence with money is always good for laughs (though terribly sad, of course).Love the Balkan brass - homage to Bulgarian Chicks? (google it on dailymotion) - and the music overall was well judged.I suppose Stu can carry on being a software analyst.",7,5,9,6 January 2015
Deadpool," Floating face down
","A wise-cracking gun for hire finds love in the underworld, but cancer robs him of his bliss - until he strikes a devilish bargain with a gene-mutating doctor.Stuffed with gags about the movie process, gets tiring, and a couple of superhero characters are thrown in because ... the IP rights were granted by the studio. Don't have to look far for the problem: written and produced by the same guys responsible for the overworked wordfest that was Zombieland. And again they chose a whining, self-satisfied lead actor.The intro is interesting, action pacy, but the formula keeps repeating until the editing runs out of imagination and a giant sigh of boredom is released at about the hour mark.Music is standard, with the worrying fact that a teen movie keeps harping back to stuff from 30 years ago. And the unfunniest post credits gag ever. Yes, you will gag.Surprised they didn't include a midget in a clown suit and an ugly pet. Plus the boob cover up was pure, 'How much can't we get away with - hehehe!'Overall: Lots of energy, but tiresome. Like Saturday Night Live.",4,6,12,28 June 2016
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Clubbed to death
","A private club of assassins locks horns with an effete billionaire bent on world depopulation, so the club turns to an underdog recruit to see off the beastly chap.Good acting and pace. Humour is a bit patchy - there's a flash of porn ass at the very end, so clearly Carry On humour just ... carries on. But the final third is a complete riot, from the scene in the church onward - I guess thanks to the director's worship of Hong Kong action films. Colin Firth did his own stunts. LOL. The fights are a bit repetitive in style, although amazing to behold, and it goes full 007 parody in the end. Overall, though, it lacks the satire of the equally ambitious Iron Sky.The problem I have is with the politics. This is a real London film - loads of money to deliver a stylish, full-on neoliberal message that Big Men Rule, democracy and liberty are sideshows. The members of the club might as well be sitting round the cabinet table in Downing Street.At one point the hero says saving Thatcher from assassination was a pity, but Thatcherism runs right through this story. All that east-end stuff? It's a fantasy - a great chunk of London's population has been deported from The Great Wen tax haven in the last 10 years because of neoliberal policies. At least there are clubbable heroes to save us from ... the corporate club.Samantha Janus is still a babe. And did I spot Paloma Faith?",6,1,5,16 May 2015
Moon," Plot holes
","I enjoyed the pace and mood of this, but the plot was unsatisfying.It's a good set up, but you wonder why the base isn't fully automated, why replacing the caretaker every three years is more expensive than supplying hundreds of clones, and how the hero is expected to survive in the escape pod.Also there was a suggestion of menace from the robot early on, but later it became so helpful you'd think it was there for exposition: 'Yes, you are a clone. And yes, I won't tell my masters you have figured out their game'.And finally - what was with the hallucination of the girl in the armchair in the first few minutes? It gave the impression of the supernatural, but the story was about skinflint corporate deception.The lead does a great job playing a double hand, and the moonscapes were cool.Plus there's a nice alarm clock gag.",6,0,6,11 September 2014
Her," Good but slow
","Interesting romantic sci-fi, with good humour. Not a comedy.I enjoyed the pace because the technology kept revealing new possibilities, putting a different slant on the usual way a couple gets on in a relationship.After about 40 mins the emphasis is on the romance, so it slows down quite a bit, then picks up again when the tech side is brought back and the operating systems reach the singularity.The ending is a bit flat for my taste - I was hoping the singularity would lead to some conflict. Overall I thought the movie was stretched out a little too long.Of course the OS's voice drew a lot of praise, and the actress is very endearing as a lover. At one point, when they go on a double date, I think there was an unintended Man-With-Two-Brains feel to the relationship. Plus I wondered about the male lead's voice - sounded sometimes like he had a speech defect.Very good, but a bit sentimental and slow for me.",7,0,1,2 September 2014
Mad Max: Fury Road," Ish a shiksh
","To escape the dungeon of a mad tyrant, a gun-toting loner teams up with a rebellious princess in her flight to paradise. Pursued by thousands of mad, mutant baxtards.115 minutes of car chase, with a brief interlude to reflect at the start of act three. The pace is amazing, the locations spectacular, as the hunt whizzes along - assault vehicles that look like prickly dinosaurs, wan war-boys celebrating their jihadi death wish, and bizarro guitaro licks from a ship's figurehead.The first part of the chase is like an old sea battle, as the tanker- galleon heaves across the desert ocean under heavy sniping fire. The second part is more like an aerial dogfight, with pole-fighters raining bombs from the air.For all the fury, there is an attempt to set up different zones, different civilisations, as in any epic quest - but it doesn't work. Simply not enough care in the plotting and characterisation, although there is a degree of development. The actors are OK, but they can't deliver much to care about, and the interlude where the action gives way to motivation is very poor. In the end even the locations turn out monotonous, and a scene where the green place comes into view is far too brief and, I think, misplaced. And all the time I was thinking about one of the anchors of the plot - the water supply - that doesn't make sense in its steampunk setting. Also the epilogue is disgustingly reactionary - reminds me of Pan's Labyrinth.Music is hectic, nothing special.Overall: Pacy and bland. Definitely not worth the Oscar hype.ps. I guess all that milk should turn into human cheese. Weird, but tasty and nutritious.",6,0,0,12 August 2016
Atonement," Mixed bag
","At a gathering in a country house a jealous little girl meddles in her sister's love life, and things will never be the same ...From an interesting novel that had an engrossing first half but, for me, trailed off in the second. So I had a different experience with the film adaptation, where the country house scenes are not quite satisfying but the following war story is brilliantly told. The narrator is a fascinating little character, but looking back I think her motivation needed to be colder and her atonement more problematic. In the end the story is wrapped up with a talking head, which I guess was unavoidable but not the mark of a great movie.The long tracking shot on the beach at Dunkirk is amazing - not only a technical marvel (the amount of ground covered, the multiple interactions) but it creates a great sense of chaos and despair.Performances are good, and it's no wonder people raved about Ronan. The music is excellent and plays about with the rhythm of a tapping type writer. Photography too, although I didn't get the sense of oppressive heat in the first act.Overall: interesting and impressive, but some big flaws.",7,3,3,30 September 2017
