The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Brilliant
","This is my favourite film and i absolutely enjoyed watching it. I've seen this film about 10 times and whenever i have a friend round i would always watch this film and they too would enjoy it. This film is amazing and is really emotional and it would be something you would cry at every time you watch it. I have read the book and i must admit the book does have so much more to offer. The book will obviously have more to bring that wasn't brought into the film and i would recommend reading it even if you're not much of a reader. This is a film that you would definitely relate to if you're feeling down or low at school, and films that you can relate to are always great to watch. Watch this film its great!!!",10,1,3,20 September 2013
About Time," Brilliant in every aspect
","This film is definitely going into my top films. The things i loved about the film was the emotion put into it that the characters gave and portrayed excellently. The story for me was great and it would touch anyone who saw it. This is a really funny film as well as giving soft emotions. When i first saw the trailer the film looked good, when i watched it it was excellent. Zooey Deschanel was meant to be playing the role of the main character which i think she wouldve done great in but Rachel McAdams was just the best choice for this. I love her because shes just a brilliant actor. There was one thing that didn't really make it interesting was there was no climax to the film until the end when he had to make that sacrifice for a new child or his father. That bit was really sad and emotional having to tell his dad that that would be the last time ever to see him. It was such a great film and you should recommend this to all your friends.",9,2,4,11 September 2013
