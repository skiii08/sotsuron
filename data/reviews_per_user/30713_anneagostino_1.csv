Requiem for a Dream," You people need to calm down!
","Yes this film is sad however you people need to wake up and smell the coffee, question; what do you think this film would have been without the blaring depressing music and the quick cut scenes, CRAP! that's what it would have been, maybe you people don't realize this but you were cheated into thinking that this depressing garbage was any good. Aronofsky short-cutted his way into making this film and fortunately for him his simple minded audience made him millions. You want to see a sad movie watch Platoon or Deer Hunter, those are two movies that are worthy or calling sad.
