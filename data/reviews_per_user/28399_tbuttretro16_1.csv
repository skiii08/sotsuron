Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Tarantino bounces back with his continuation of the story of The Bride
","When I say 'bounce-back,' don't let that fool you completely. I thought Kill Bill: Vol.1 was decent, but for the great Quentin Tarantino, that's not strong enough. Kill Bill: Vol.2 is simply everything missing from the first volume. No Crazy 88? No over-the- top blood spewing battles? No problem. This is made up with more excellent Tarantino writing. David Carradine gets a thumbs up performance as the fiendish Bill. His strong presence gives new life to the movie. Not so strong however was Michael Madsen, as Bill's brother Budd. Yes, he was very memorable in Reservoir Dogs, but in this film I found him to be a bore. There were many scenes in the movie that I couldn't get into at all. Then later on, many scenes (like the training with Pai Mei) filled the holes of the story and created much character development. I can't write this review without mentioning the outstanding Beatrix 'The Bride' (or Black Mamba, whatever suits) Kiddo played by Uma Thurman. In the follow- up, she shows even more color to her character, besides of course red and yellow. If your concerned about the lack of crazy action like the previous volume, don't sweat it. You'll get more out of Kill Bill: Vol.2 than you'd think.",8,1,2,24 October 2014
