10 Cloverfield Lane," That was original but a bit far fetched!
","Really nicely done! I will try not to give out any spoilers (you will see the warning when I do). This movie was a bit predictable when the trailer came out. Going to the movies, I found out that predictable is the only thing the movie is not. Goodman was amazing as were the other actors that played with. He was really really good, from words to expressions even to breathing! The story is a captivating one, I mean it includes a bunker! What else do you need?It was tense throughout, nicely done with its moments of tension but also the relaxed ones that kind of led you to think that everything would be OK, just around the time that something new happened! I do have my objections for some parts but I think that the overall feeling was good.I really think that in their efforts to try and keep the ending a bit unpredictable, the script was kind of confusing with chemical warfare, conspiracies and other incidents that they seemed a bit out of place and just there to confuse. (spoiler alert) I mean that the guy built the bunker only recently but then how did he keep this girl from the local school as a prisoner there when she was little or something? It's kind of out of the context and time. Anyway, the one thing that I did not like and did not appreciate was the ending with the aliens that seemed a bit stupid and far fetched! I mean, it's a solid movie and then you show that she actually threw a bottle of whiskey (talk about a baseball throw) into the mouth of the monster and then she survived the fall. Yes, that's plausible. And then when she escaped she decided, having all this experience from throwing the bottle to join forces and fight for humanity. These last couple of scenes threw the movie from a solid 9 to a marginal 7 for me...",7,0,4,11 April 2016
War Dogs," As real as it gets
","I was not aware of anything related to this movie till I watched it. Not even the story behind it. I just watched it and was amazed about the story told. It is amazing how two guys in their early 20s could pull all of this off. And how stupidly the American army procurement was taking place. It's really breathtaking that someone could pull this off, making as much money as they did. Both main actors were amazing. As was Bradley Cooper for the little amount of screen time he got. I really believe that these two are within the most promising actors of their generation. The movie itself is high pace, really concentrated, with lots of things going on all the time. It was intense at moments and really powerful at others. I really enjoyed it and to be honest, was quite pleased with the way things turned out in the movie!",8,0,0,22 November 2016
Deepwater Horizon," Amazing
","Given the fact that this movie is about a tragedy, both on the human side but also on the environmental, maybe the word 'amazing' is not the best to entitle my review. But in any case, this movie is really worth watching. It's about the courage needed to face adversities and come out of them in one piece. But it's also about standing up for what you believe to be true, no matter what others might say. This movie was about the worst oil spill in the history of the US and at many points it's really shocking. I particularly felt my stomach in a knot when this seagull entered the bridge of the ship near the rig. Mark Walberg was amazing but Kurt Russel was also breathtaking. I was also impressed by all the mechanics and technology involved in the process which are usually a black box for people that are not involved in this business. Overall, a really informative movie with some really interesting acting from all the actors involved and of course a really inconvenient truth that has to become a lesson for all of us.",8,0,0,16 January 2017
John Wick," If you like the genre, this is a must
","I was really in-between 7 and 8, as a score for the movie. To be honest, this is a relative rating for me. I have rated better movies with less, but this movie, in relation to others of the genre is simply awesome! To attempt to break down the logic of the movie a bit... The reasons why Keanu goes after this pathetic excuse of a son are not logical. Any reasonable person would expect him to accept the mobster's offer and get the car back and a new dog. Well, guess what! If he had done what was reasonable, we would not have a movie in the end! What happens after that is actually against all logic and it's what I love about the movie. He goes into impossible situations, just to survive and some more! In my mind, he could be a Tarantino character this guy. I assume that no one would complain then. Overall, his character, the situations and the discussions in the movie, seem to me like reading a comic or graphic novel of some kind. His face, his way of moving, everything, generated still images of a comic book in my mind. This is what I loved about the movie and this special flavor in the end made me love it. It was watching a movie and reading a good graphic novel all in one. The acting from the father-crime lord is from my point of view, exemplary for any type of movie and of course I loved the addition as the receptionist of the guy from Fringe TV Series (I am really bad with names!). The ending is satisfactory for me although I would have liked more (a) a slower death for the son and (b) a quicker death for the mobster father, since he gave him all this crap in the movie. Overall a nice way to spend your evening if you are not up for a really mind-puzzling movie. Keanu Reeves was really good for the first time after quite some movies.",8,6,13,9 March 2015
Lone Survivor," Better than expected
","When you see a movie that depicts any kind of war conflict it usually borders on propaganda or something similar. It's inevitable. Having said that, I really enjoyed this movie as it seems and was more real than many others that I have watched! You can say whatever you like for the training and tactics of the Marines and you can agree or not, or find this really unnecessary and violent or whatever. But what's true is that what you see is what actually happens in the real world. And being inspired from a true story, makes this movie really really worthwhile. The fact that these four guys are left against all these enemies and the way in which the fight for their lives is truly remarkable and well depicted! It's not your usual thing where the lead man always dodges bullets and gets out of a gun fight without a scratch. As far as war movies are concerned, it's a 7.5 for me, closer to 8 than to 7... If you like this kind of movies, you will definitely love it!",8,2,3,11 January 2016
Memento," Original! Even so many years after...
","Yes, I was like the one in a thousand that had not seen this movie when it came out, or even 10-15 years later! So, time came to sit down and watch it! It was mind-blowing! The idea behind it was so clever and so ahead of its time even for today I think. It seems like memento was one of the reasons why film-makers started thinking of 'tricks' like this one in movies that came after it. No worries, no spoilers here! Will not ruin it for you! Instead, I will give some practical directions for you to enjoy the movie without losing your mind or forgetting stuff along the way. First of all, don't turn it off in the first 20-30 minutes! It may be a bit confusing and upsetting, but it's worth to stick with it! Try to be as sober and rested as possible while watching it. Don't put it on with one eye open cause you'll probably fall asleep and miss all the movie cues along the way even if you end up watching it till the end! So, eyes open, alert and paying attention to the details. Watching this movie and keeping a straight face about it is difficult but it pays off in the end!",8,0,1,9 November 2015
Pirate Radio," Sweet, rock, humour, the right amount!
","Amazing movie! Just awesome! Really interesting story behind it, amazing cast, nice scenario and lots and lots of laughs! The soundtrack of the movie may as well be among one of the best of all times! I am already looking for the OST to listen to it. I liked the ending, so much, especially when the tragedy was avoided and especially when the Count survived, even if it looked like a long shot! Pretty girls, nerds, music, humor... What else do you need to have a good time? One of the best music-related movies of all times! Up there with the Solist, Pianist, Legend of 1900, etc.",8,2,2,2 July 2015
"I Love You, Man"," It's a really good one!
","Did not expect to like this movie that much. It's a nice idea to begin with. Having a guy with no guy friends to hang with and having your future wife begging you to find some buddies... That's almost sci-fi, but it was good! Nice acting, loved the extra characters that surrounded the main cast (J.K. Simmons was brilliant one more time). I had such a fun watching the movie, lots of laughs and a really weird but still special bond between these two guys. It's not the one that will get you on the floor, laughing your a.. off, but it's still good! Give it a chance and it will definitely be worth your while!",7,1,1,29 January 2016
Creed," For its kind it's OK, but it was not great...
","If you love rocky, then you probably rated this with more than eight out of ten. I didn't but I still gave it a seven. It was an intense movie. I did not buy the fact that this guy was doing amazing in a company and he just gave it all up to become a boxer cause it was in his gut to do so... I just don't think it's realistic! But he did, and then he went into the strange boxing world of Philly, back to his roots, to find himself. And then he finds a girl that just like Adrian had some kind of serious health problem. Why? Was that really necessary? Boxing wise the movie had everything the average fan would like to see. I don't know how close to the reality it was but for me it was close enough. Liked the occasional joke here and there and I have to say that Stalone was born for this part. For all his parts in Rocky and Creed. Nothing more. But for those roles he was the best there could ever be. The lymphoma twist was OK but again it was not explored as much as it could have been so it remained fairly superficial apart from some powerful scenes in the house where he is being carried to the toilet to vomit. The fight in the end was as expected as the end in a Disney story, but still it was intense. A bit far fetched again, but this is the trademark of the series so I was fine. Could have been a lot better than it was, but it was pretty decent still. Not a chance for an Oscar Sylvester, sorry, no matter how heart breaking it is to see you come back with this movie, 35 or something years after the first.",7,0,1,21 March 2016
Orphan," Yes, it's a decent thriller!
","I had watched it some time ago, but did not actually remember what happened (comes with age!). I re-watched it recently and it was as fun as I could remember from the first time. It drives you to start yelling at the TV at some scenes! Not a really really happy ending, suspense, agony, all the ingredients for a good thriller. What I especially appreciated was the fact that there's always evidence of something supernatural in the atmosphere, despite the final explanation of the entire thing... The kid was amazing in acting as was the rest of the crew, although the father, as an actor in general, is not my favorite. He was too indifferent for my taste, from all aspects. He acted fine and everything, but I just think that this was not his kind of role. Wrong face for the part... The small girl was awesome as well as the boy! I think this is one of the thrillers that define the genre. You sit at the edge of your seat waiting what will come next! Nice! Really nice!",7,1,2,7 January 2016
Spotlight," Hard topic, brilliant movie
","Well, when you choose to watch a movie with such a 'difficult' topic, you're always kind of 'on the fence'. I have to say that I really enjoyed every minute of the movie (as much as enjoy can be used as a verb in this type of cases). Amazing acting, wonderful cast and a truly breathtaking story that no matter how inconvenient it might be, it was 100% true. Mark Ruffalo and Liev Schreiber were truly amazing as was Stanley Tucci who's one of my all time favorite 'chameleon-like' actors. Especially the character of Marty Baron was a weird one, as you instinctively disliked him in the beginning but for me, as the movie went on, he became one of my favorites. I would highly recommend the movie, even if you're not in the mood for something really deep or with lots of moral questions. I actually wanted to watch a cartoon instead but the movie captivated me from the first minute to its last...",9,0,0,14 September 2016
500 Days of Summer," Not that deep... Still good!
","Well, this is one of the movies that have escaped my attention for quite some time. Decided to watch it the other day and I have to say that I really have mixed feelings. As far as production, direction, actors, etc, goes, the movie was great! Really liked the back and forth of the story and how the mood of the movie changed from one moment to the next. I liked the way the romance evolved and also the moments, the awkward moments of problems were depicted nicely.Having said that, I really expected some more insight from the movie. It makes a specific point that everyone is bound to find someone they will love, out of luck and coincidence. And no matter how much against relationships and commitment you are, there will come someone that will sweep you off your feet. OK, got that and really agree. The movie leaves destiny in the sideline and this is something I really believe also. All in all, the movie makes a valid point for relationships, and I really liked the fact that this was not yet another love story... I did not appreciate the character of this weird guy that seems to have nothing going on in his life, no interest whatsoever, working in a mediocre job, making cards and being miserable about it and about everything else around him. He tries to compensate for his miserable life by falling for this amazing, full of life girl that seems to have too many things going on for her. He's desperate to cling on to her and she's clearly the joy of life that in the end, evades him to move on. She was into him for his looks, or cause sometimes girl like this are being attracted by these mysterious, weird guys, only to find out that they are being dragged in their misery in the end. I think that this aspect of the movie is not pointed out enough. I mean, of course it would not work. Of course she would eventually move on. But why? How does the result relate to the initial situation? Is it her fault? And then, when he flashes back in their relationship and sees all the small moments that indicated the end, what's about that? That was completely and utterly irrelevant. These moments exist in every relationship. The signs can always be found, both the good and the bad ones. I really think that this movie should have focused more on timing, compatibility of characters, life-theories, etc., to explain why some things just don't work, instead of focusing on the randomness of relationships. PS: Really hated the 'Autumn' metaphor in the end of the movie... For God's sake, this was not what the movie needed in the closing...",7,0,0,20 January 2016
The Hateful Eight," Golden standard, everything you expect and more!
","It's a Tarantino movie, on the same golden standards like all the rest. It's kind of long but it's worth it and it doesn't drag too much. There are some points when I felt it was a bit slow, but it was a really good movie!The plot was well thought, the mystery of what actually happened was well preserved till the end, and all the actors that were in it were brilliant! It was a bit harsh in many occasions but this is my kind of movie. It was harsh, realistic and graphic. The movie punched you in the stomach more than one and it gave a really strong historical background. Samuel Jackson was my favorite but I also liked Walton Goggins who goes on my watch list from now on. It's a movie worth your time, provided that you are not too sleepy when you start watching the DVD.",8,2,6,28 March 2016
Black Mass," The 'true story' effect!
","Well, I am always a sucker for true story movies and this was not any different! I loved it! First of all, Johnny Depp was awesome! Make up or not, crazy eyes or whatever, he was phenomenal in this role! I adored the scenery and the whole 80's-90's feeling of the movie. Really well-directed and with an excellent cast of really talented actors! Interesting faces, so much that you actually think that these guys were the actual gangsters. The violent scenes were really plausible yet tasteful enough to remain within what you could handle seeing. I can't find anything wrong with this movie leaving the theater. Nothing. I am not a big fan of the genre but I enjoy similar movies, so it's an easy eight for me. I can't say what it would need to get to 9 or 10. I think that this is the ceiling here, and it's not a low one. It's a movie that you will definitely enjoy. You will be afraid of this guy for sure, cause the makeup alone was enough to terrify, even not throwing the crazy look into the equation. This is a must-see!",8,0,1,26 October 2015
Suicide Squad," Weird and confusing but good enough
","First of all, this was a really good idea if you ask me. Secondly, it was really well-made in many parts of the movie. But there was something that didn't fit. Fist things first. I really jumped at the opportunity to watch a movie with all of these antiheroes in it. Loved the concept (not aware of the related comics, so don't judge me for that). When the movie started showing the background of the villains, some of the information about them although playfully presented, were a bit all over the place. Seemed like some things were too much even for such kind of a movie. Didn't appreciate the element of these beings as well. The movie could have been a perfectly nice one, without the addition of the supernatural element in this sense. The story was plausible but on the other hand it seemed like something they cooked up so that they can make a movie. Nothing too special behind it. Overall, it's a seven, only based on the fact that I love this kind of movies. If it was not a DC-Marvel-like movie, it would have gotten a five at best. Should work a bit harder next time though. For the time being, this was a big disappointment for me.",7,0,1,17 October 2016
Doctor Strange," Welcome Mr., Master, Dr. Strange!
","Amazing! As I have pointed out in more than one occasions, I am really a sucker for Marvel movies. I am. But this one was brilliant as well. Filled with action, a nice plot, cool superpowers (or more like human powers) and quite some sense of humor that didn't hurt the story line. This was an amazing addition to the Marvel universe. A really amazing one. Enjoyed the movie from beginning to end (stay for the last shot a while after the ending titles, as always). Benedict Cumberbatch was a worthy Dr. Strange, indeed, and I can't wait to see him in the next movie that his character will be involved. Mads Mikkelsen was also brilliant as was Tilda Swinton who was the ideal candidate for the role she had. Could not imagine anyone else in her part. No one! If you haven't caught the movie yet, hurry cause it won't be around for much longer and then you'll have to wait for the DVDs to come out! Brilliant!",9,0,1,5 December 2016
Interstellar," Interesting, human, fantasy and fantastic at the same time!
","Well, if you are a fan of the science fiction genre, 10 will not be enough for you to rate this movie. I am a fan somewhat, but I also get a bit 'down' when it comes to thinking about the endless of the universe and our ultimate fate, dying. I have always watched such movies with great anticipation but always felt a bit bad in the end, thinking all of this. Well, this movie had it all. It was about a really really serious problem, the actual fatality of the entire human race. What can be worse than that? I enjoyed the acting of all actors involved with no exceptions. Matthew McConaughey is 'on fire' for a couple of years now and he just picked it up from there. It was an amazing performance. The concept was so nice and interesting, the script was awesome and the way it was presented it was so captivating that I found myself wanting the movie to continue so that I would see what will happen with Mathew and the astronaut-lady! It seemed too long a movie, but with all the storyline being firm and exciting, it really did not feel like that long, despite the fact that it was. The ending was a bit difficult to come in terms with and consider it plausible, but in the end it was one of these nice endings that you come to appreciate. The power of the final scenes of the movie was actually immense. Seeing his daughter at this age, talking to her and touching her, was really really breathtaking. It was a movie to remember and I do hope that there could be a way for a sequel and then a prequel, etc. Many things are left unexplained about how we reached that point. It could be a prequel... Just throwing the idea out there... Overall, a movie that challenges your intellect, your basic instincts, everything. It's a must-see movie folks...",9,2,5,16 April 2015
American Sniper," Nicely done - Amazing story
","Well, this was one of the movies that really shook me. I did not see the end coming as I did not know this guy's story and I don't like reading the plot before the movie. So, watching it without knowing, really left me with an open mouth in the end. Apart from that, it seemed kind of going on forever without needing to. I could have done with some less duration and some more emphasis towards the end. Apart from that, this was an amazing movie, as are all movies based on true stories from my part. I really liked the way the soldier was depicted. Eastwood did not hesitate to make him look as the typical American soldier (or any soldier for that matter) that is sent to war believing the lies and propaganda of his country. If he made him any other way it would not have been realistic but still you have to give him the credit that this is not yet another American-biased or nation-biased movie. The guy was one of these people that are good in everything they do, since they are passionate about it. He is the kind of guy that gets obsessed with anything he does and that does extremely well. He excelled in all his life settings and became an example, even without any deep and really sophisticated thinking and character. He just got the job done. And one day he came home, doing what he thought was best for his country to be killed by one of his own. I think that irony is one of the main parts of this film that makes any viewer jump out of his/her seat in the end. Overall, a really really nice movie!",8,9,20,26 January 2015
Ant-Man," Did not see that coming, literally!
","Well, it was the only marvel movie that I wasn't crazed about after watching the trailer! Even for Ghost Rider and other similar movies, once I saw the trailer I was like 'I have to see this'! Apart from Green Lantern of course! With Ant-Man, I decided that I wouldn't throw my money at this movie, no matter the cast that seemed really good and promising (Michael Douglas alone was enough). And then I just went to see if with some friends that insisted... The movie blew my mind! Loved the concept and the technology behind it and after all, this guy was even more masculine than both spider-mans...! I was completely overwhelmed with the connection with Tony Stark and the Avengers connection and I am so looking forward to the sequel or even better to seeing Ant-Man be a part of Avengers! OK, the concept is a bit far-fetched but come on with this need to rationalize everything and make them plausible in a marvel movie! For God's sake! Ant-Man is awesome in his own way and is better than many many other super-marvel-heroes with better concepts and powers that came and vanished!",8,4,9,24 November 2015
Incendies," Words seem useless
","When you rate a movie with 10/10, it's usually really really difficult to find the words to describe it. This one was one of the most impactful movies I have ever seen. Can't stop thinking it since yesterday and I am sure I won't stop thinking it for a long time.First of all, the actors were all brilliant. All of them. The story was breathtaking and the slow evolution of the movie leading to the climax in the end, renders you speechless and motionless to say the least. I have to admit that although I assumed such an ending, I did not think it was plausible as the movie leaves out the element of time and kind of confused me. I could not make out the exact age of the lady who sings during the stages of the movie, so I was kind of like doing the math over and over again in the end to make sure I was not mistaken!Overall, a terrible story in its core, but one that shows how life can be in its extremes and how people can rise above such horrible events like war and its crimes and show the kind of attitude this woman showed through her letters. This is a movie that no one should miss!",10,1,4,3 December 2015
Nightcrawler," Different, good different
","To begin with, I have to admit that I was not the biggest fan of Jake Gyllenhaal... After watching this movie, I added him to the list of the actors whose movies I will definitely watch out for. I was reluctant to watch the movie in the beginning, but as it unwinded, it really grew on me. I loved the idea to begin with. Looking at how the night crawlers make a living in the streets of L.A., was really really interesting and thrilling at the same time. The way Jake depicts his character, his mania, his drive and perfectionist character, is immaculate. Even this weird look on his face and the moments he seems to be on the edge of freaking out but does not, were breathtaking. I found myself actually being frightened about what might happen next. The entire movie was a roallercoaster for the viewer. Being on his side, then wishing he is caught for what he does, then again not. His co-actor/helper was also brilliant. The movie was quite long (approx. 2 hours) but it did not seem like it at all. If you are looking for a nice thriller to spend your evening watching, this is one heck of a choice.",8,0,0,16 March 2015
The Revenant," Not Oscar material but it was amazing!
","Well, I am one of those guys that truly believe that Leo should have taken an Oscar for quite some time now. I am guessing he will get it for this one but this won't be his best work. Overall, the film was really really good. Breathtaking photography and realistic as hell in every aspect, from everyday life to the fighting scenes (especially the one with the bear).I am still trying to wrap my head around the kind of quick recovery that Leo had, after being attacked by the bear, but it's OK. I mean, one of his fingers was stripped of its skin and then it was OK after I don't know, a month or something, which would be hard even for Wolverine! Despite that, some of the scenes in the movie were really really clever and breathtaking, like the scene with the horse, the bear fight and a couple more. I would say that the movie could have been 20 minutes shorter with no effect on the plot whatsoever, but overall it was a very good movie!",8,0,2,28 January 2016
Bridge of Spies," Excellent! Tom Hanks delivers once again
","After watching Sully, I went back to see some movies with Tom Hanks that I had skipped. Bridge of Spies was brilliant. The way in which a civilian, although a lawyer, was dragged into this whole thing and the way in which he handled it, was amazing and thrilling to watch. Mark Rylance was also breathtaking in his role as Rudolf Abel. The movie had a really nice plot behind it, amazing scenery and photography in general, and it did keep you at the edge of your seat. It was quite long, but still I felt like it could have used some extra time towards the end. My favorite moments were of course towards the end of the movie, when all loose ends are tied up one way or the other. Overall it was a performance by all actors but also by Tom Hanks in particular that was up there with all the major roles he has portrayed so far.",8,1,1,19 September 2016
The Lego Movie," Interesting idea, but no thanks..
","Well, first of all, when you hear about a Lego Movie you think to yourself 'this will be fun'! In the end, it was not. Nicely done for small children I guess, although sometimes the humor was more 'adult'. I enjoyed only a handful of scenes that were nicely done but nothing more than that. The script was nice but needless to say that I just watched one hour and then switched the TV off. Nice messages and approach for the society we live in, but in some way it just was not good enough. Don't waste your time on it. I am really baffled by the really high score of the movie. I don't know, maybe I missed something that all the others see (apart from the end of the movie!).",5,3,5,28 March 2016
Captain America: Civil War," That's why you pay the ticket!
","Well, nothing to say there, apart from the title of my comment. That's exactly why we still pay tickets to see movies like this, beyond our thirties and even in our forties! Packed with action, right dose of humor, amazing acting and truly breathtaking battles.When during such a movie you really feel like you're playing a video game yourself and you are cheering with excitement, then this is a movie well made. Having taken one for the team with the not so nice 'Batman VS Superman', this was actually a movie worth watching. The plot was there, the story was captivating and all the elements that someone would look for were present. I adored the fact that all the superheroes were treated as equals (although some may overpower others in 'reality'). The fights and the way that the pros and cons of each one came out, was really nicely done.My personal favorite was Spiderman. Although this franchise has been a bit torn and abused so far, this guy seems quite legit. It would be nice to see a good spiderman movie after that. If you haven't watched it yet, get a ticket and go on...",10,8,18,16 May 2016
The Conjuring 2," Best one in years!
","I am a fan of thrillers and horror movies. It's been quite some time since I last saw a horror movie like this one. It was a delight to watch this one! I am a sucker for true stories and seeing that this one originated from parts of a real story, was all I needed! The movie had all the necessary elements and classical standards of horror movies. Jump scares, visual effects, sudden noises, atmosphere, the works! The cast was amazing and the acting in all levels was amazing. I really like the children that were all up to the task. The depiction of the era and the costumes and everything were really high quality. I watched this in a cinema and despite all those stupid teenagers that laugh for no reason, it managed to captivate me and have me at the edge of my seat. I can recall more than ten times when I was really scared which was the first time after so many lousy movies that try to scare you with stupid effects. This movie has atmosphere, it is nicely crafted and it's really worth your time! If your girlfriend is kind of scared easily, don't take her with, better go with some friends instead. And choose times when the movie theater will be a bit empty, so that you really have the silence to get into the movie.",10,1,4,12 June 2016
Inside Out," Awesome! Not for small kids, but awesome!
","First of all, I was really concerned when watching it, if I could get a five or six year-old to watch it...Having said that, this movie was awesome as an idea. I loved the way that the workings of the brain were paralleled to the characters of the movie and in general the graphics, etc. Plenty moments of laughs, although not hysterical as in other movies, but still lots of laughs!Loved the anger character as well as disgust! Loved them! I really liked the small clips in the end where they show how the brains of other people work, as long as the brain of a dog and a cat (this last one was to die for!). Overall, when a movie is as good as this one, you don't need to write much. Definitely worth watching with you kid, I would say ages 9 and up, and for sure worth watching as an adult, still hang up on animated movies! ;-)",8,27,66,26 October 2015
Foxcatcher," Wow! Slow and then boom!
","My rating here reflects exactly the feeling I got towards the final moments of the movie. It was a rather slow film that might get many of you uninterested after half an hour, but it not that simple. It's a well-made drama with lots of different characters, being affected and driven by their demons, hopes and dreams, in ways that intertwine their fates in an extraordinary way. Brother issues, mother-son issues and so on and so forth, in a movie that no cast member fell behind. All of them reached high performances throughout the movie, especially Steve Carell which was a huge surprise to say the least. This is a must-watch that took me a long time to get my hands on, but it's definitely worth your time!",9,1,1,24 November 2015
Gone Girl," Amazing from beginning to end
","At last a really really good film! Amazing storyline, beautiful acting, nice plot! I really enjoyed it! Although quite long, I did not lose interest at any point which is really hard for a movie that long. The idea behind it was also amazing. I really liked Affleck from day 1 and I was convinced that his wife was the crazy one, but still, the way it all turned out in the end, was just breathtaking. Although I would have loved for her to be caught and thrown into jail, the ending that took place after all, was even more appealing and 'just' in a way. I can't stop thinking about the movie even after two days of watching it. If you are planning on watching it, make sure you are not sleepy and that you have all you need with you, cause this movie will not let you leave your chair for a moment!",10,1,6,5 January 2015
The Theory of Everything," Not exactly a Stephen Hawking movie
","To sort things out from the beginning, if you're looking for a movie for SH the Physicist, this is not one. This is a movie for SH the man and partly the Physicist. It's a well-made movie, focusing on his relationship with his first wife with whom they have three children. It's more or less a film about a relationship where one of the two partners is seriously ill and the other tries to support and be there. And then again, it's not completely about that. It seems to me that the intention was to portray this, but with SH being who he is, it could not be just a movie about his relationship. They had to have some background about him and his work. But then, incorporating this in the film, it inevitably took away time and depth from the depiction of the relationship and all its ups and downs. The result for me is indeed a touching movie with all the elements there, or at least most of them, and with an amazing role being performed in the best way possible. Apart from that, it seems that the movie remains superficial around the topics of the relationship, leaving out many elements of the cruel reality that could serve the purpose of the movie. We never got to find out how they coped, we never got to find out about the actual and real problems of the couple and the children. They are being heavily implied but not tackled with directly. Instead of that, the movie just shows the picture of Professor SH running around on his chair with the children hanging from it. I also missed the participation of the respective families in this or the declaration of their absence. His father and mother seem really distant from everything else other than some family gatherings, which looks odd when we do not have any indication of them having some tension or problems in their relationship. I mean, if your child goes through that, you are there the whole time, something we never saw in the movie. Don't let me be misunderstood, I really loved the movie. But, I would expect something more from it, given that it does have a really interesting and powerful story in its core. My problem is that in a way the director or maybe the script writer, chose the mainstream/in between path, of creating a film that shows a little bit of everything to capture diverse audiences, whereas this film should be about the relationship in all its depth and width... I would highly recommend watching it! And if a comparison could be made with the Imitation Game, which kind of resembles it in a way, I would give thumbs up to the Imitation Game any day of the week.",7,0,0,24 February 2015
Room," Now, that's a story there!
","The story behind the movie is breathtaking on its own. Being held up in a room for that long and not going insane is by itself a miracle and a triumph of mind over matter. I loved the fact that the movie focused on what happens after, which is a big deal on its own. Everyone seems to think that it's all about getting out of a hardship when it's also about handling the aftermath and making it over such an experience. This was not a sad movie. It was a movie about courage, about never letting go and keeping it together. I will forever remember the dialogue when she says to the kid 'I am not a good mom' and he replies, 'well, you're mom'. This was the one phrase that defined the movie. Nothing more needed there. This movie, while not a 9 or a 10, it's one of these movies that will stay with you forever.",8,1,6,29 February 2016
X-Men: Apocalypse," It's goooood!
","Have been reading quite some reviews before deciding to write my own. My opinion? I think that this one was probably one of the best X-Men movies of all time. I mean, if you take out the first one that I watched when I was half my age now and I was amazed by it, I think the others are pretty much below this one. I read comments about the CGI, the costumes, etc. I am all for it. I also agree that the X-Men franchise has been struggling a lot with costumes and effects, more than someone would expect. I mean, we have seen nice CGI elsewhere that also looked as realistic as they can get (Deadpool for one). I can't understand why they can't make Psylocke look real when she is running on that rooftop in the final battle. This was disappointing as hell. And of course, it seems like Mystique was better off with CGI and not with this weird costume that looks like it came out of a cheap rental for Halloween. Other than that, the movie had the funny element, albeit not that much as avengers or deadpool of course, but it was nicely made. I completely digged the story about the first mutant and I liked it a lot (would be amazing to have this in ancient Greece, no?). The cast was good in their roles, although I would like to see someone else as Jean Grey. Sophie Turner did a great job but I think her looks just wasn't enough for me. I think that the previous Jean Grey cannot be surpassed. The scenario was really good also but I felt at times that the movie was too much spread out all over the place. Maybe keeping things more tight would be better for the movie. Overall, it had so much material that the easiest thing to do is to find loose ends. But that's beyond the point of such movies. For example, I also didn't like the fact that they magically build the house back and I don't think that their powers allow them to do such things, but anyways, I won't sit down and nag about the plausibility of such thing in a superhero movie!Looking at the movie afterwards, you can say lots of things and really go into details and miss the essence. My feeling while seeing it was that this is 8.5/10. I can't give halves, so I bump it down to 8 cause 9 seems too much. Apart from one or two scenes, I was truly immersed and I enjoyed every part. And of course, the nice connection in the end with the next movie was worth waiting for. This was a nicely done movie and it would be rated even higher if it wasn't so closely released with Deadpool or Civil War.",8,22,38,2 June 2016
Ex Machina," Well, it's really in the middle. Nothing special
","6 out of 10 comes mainly cause I am somewhat of a fan of AI related movies and it's really really generous. The acting was not that special on any part or level. Nice concept, nice idea and an amazing setting for the movie. Other than that, nothing. It was really really frustrating that a no-brain that was chosen to carry out a test, managed to completely screw things up for a guy that had all the mind in the world to build his own empire but had no mind at all for making the place he worked and lived in safer.He was the best programmer money could buy and yet this other guy that new just the average stuff there is to know, managed to hack him and change his security system. And then you get the amazingly clever AI robot that manages to seduce a guy that has spent lots and lots of hours on illegal websites as it seems, to open the cage and let the beast out! And the best of all is that in the end, this guy that works out every day and was really super strong, cannot muster some courage to hit back the flimsy robot and survive. None whatsoever! I am all for fairytale, but sometimes, the power in made-up stories comes from real facts in them. This movie is close to reality, it is plausible, but the critical parts, where the outcome of the movie hangs by a thread, are not realistic at all, and lack lots and lots of evidence if you will. Tried to provide this review a week after watching the movie so that I get a bit calmer, but it seems that frustration comes back every time I think about it, so I will stop here. My overall recommendation, rent it when it comes out on DVD. Don't waste your money on going to the movies for it, you're not missing out on anything. PS: A note to all the movie/script writers out there: A.I. has been done hundreds of times in movies, following the same basic pattern. Robots are evil and they will be the end of humanity, blah blah blah. Or on the other hand, robots also turn into 'humans' eventually. To be able to create something original within all this 'already-made' cloud of movies, you have to go the extra mile and I am sad to say that 'Ex Machina' did not.",6,17,36,3 April 2015
The Imitation Game," What an awesome and sad story...
","Although when you see the trailer you may focus on glorious wins over the Germans and amazing code-braking skills, this movie is so much more than that. Benedict Cumberbatch performs amazingly a role that is really close to the TV series Sherlock in many aspects. I think that the movie could have done without the changes in the historic events that took place, but still, a really nice movie that I will remember for a long time. Keira Knightley is also breathtaking adding another amazing performance in her - already filled - resume. The entire movie really gave out the feeling of the era, with amazing costumes and excellent photography. All and all it was amazing to see the story of this gifted individual that played such a major role in the world history. If you plan on seeing it, make sure you are in the mood and allow no 'talkers' in the company as the movie demands complete silence and dedication to really absorb the tension and drama it brings with.",9,2,6,27 January 2015
Jurassic World," When you're a fan, it really doesn't matter. But...
","Well, to be honest, I just decided to go and see the movie more or less for the memories. I was merely 10 years old when the first one came out and by the time Jurassic Park III was out, I was eighteen. At age 32, I wanted to see whether or not I would be as impressed. I just watched it yesterday and then sat down on the computer and searched for the trailers of the old ones. I expected them to be too obvious and far fetched and 'in the past'. No. It was the other way around. I am now looking forward to seeing the old ones again. I do!The Jurassic World was OK. But when you're a fiction fanatic, you don't aim for 'OK'. You aim for f*** awesome! Well, that's not the one if you aiming that high. The acting was mediocre. I did not like Chris Pratt. I think that the character depicted by Sam Neil was much more appealing in this context. I don't think the movie needed a pumped up macho guy that is a dinosaur-lover and a commando. Bryce Dallas Howard was awesome as she is Jurassic material, following in the footsteps of the previous women in the series. I liked her overall as I liked the eccentric billionaire. On the other hand, Vincent D'Onofrio was too weak and did not manage to showcase a really bad guy. Failed to be exact. The cast was overall too weak. When in the previous ones you had Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum and Julianne Moore, there's nothing more to be said. I also did not like some of the scenes where the protagonists just look in the horizon and the camera just shows their face. It was too anachronistic and weird. In general, directing and what else, was not of the known standards. You saw the huge dinosaur walking next to Chris Pratt, with I don't know how many tons, and the ground did not even move a bit. I missed the effect with the water in the glasses or on the ground, rippling from the steps of a dinosaur. These things are done already but they are also the crown jewels of this trilogy. Don't leave them out! Or the tapping of the claw of the velociraptor on the kitchen floor... In other scenes, you saw the actors walking around fighting dinosaurs, like any human in their right mind would walk between the feet of a T-Rex! And weirdly enough, manage to escape as they did. And then, when there's no original thought, you see the sea creature just jumping out of the water, eating the big enemy. Too convenient, too easy, too predictable. Fight scenes needed some wider angles so that the viewer could get the entire fight. They also needed some better directing and positioning of the actors. That's mainly the reason why we pay the ticket. Make it worth, please! I will now look for the bundle of the first three movies in a DVD and sit down and watch them. This one really made me appreciate the old ones more. At least, the promise of a sequel to this one was something to hope for. And I would LOVE to see J.K. Simmons in it!",7,12,41,25 June 2015
Logan," It's sad but that's life... Even for Logan!
","Went to see this movie with a knot in my gut. With a realization that this is the end of the line. Come on, this is not a spoiler, we all know it already! Logan is not dead either way, as new iterations of the X-Men could come at any time.. Wolverine gave life to Hugh Jackman as he gave life to the role. No matter who comes along, Jackman will always be the first one that came so close. Just like the comics were sketched after him...! The movie was awesome. It kind of grabbed you by the hand from minute one and never let go. It was dark and gloomy and it kept crushing your hopes over and over again, when you tried to think that a miraculous comeback could take place.In movies like that, I feel that there is no room for actor critique, for long and exhausting analyses, etc. Logan was f*** awesome! It is an end of an era, till proved otherwise at least, and it's dark as dark night was in a sense. Just get out there and go watch it...",9,1,5,6 March 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," This is why you pay the ticket!
","Well, I watched it last night and I am still amazed and thinking about it! Truly one of the greatest marvel movies. I read some of the negative reviews from other users and I have to say that I don't understand them. Sometimes it feels like they paid a ticket to see a marvel movie, and then they expected some kind of Oscar winning performance and some deep and meaningful life-inspiring story. No. That's not it. If you expect that, look for another movie. For me, this kind of movies is like having single-flavor smoothies, like lemon or orange or strawberry, and then, one day a guy comes and says, 'do you want them all in one?'. That's actually it. Iron man, Thor, Hulk and Captain America, some very successful characters, all-in-one! What more can you ask for? I really liked the depiction of the different characters and how they all blended and interact with one another. It's really nice how each character keeps its own uniqueness and how they also blend together, creating some amazing moments. I really appreciated the humor of the movie which was really useful to break the tension in many points during the story. The Ultron was AMAZING as a villain as well as the Vision. The movie was packed with action and had an amazing flow that made you think you were already 1h30m into the movie, when it was actually only 45 minutes. Scenes that were too much even for such a movie were significantly less than the first movie. I really liked the way some parallel stories evolve and I was really happy to see in the end how the movie leaves room for another one.",10,35,70,7 May 2015
Everest," Mindblown by the movie and human stupidity
","This movie needs no reviews whatsoever. It is an amazing piece of work! All the actors, the setting, the directing, everything was as good as they get! I am not a fan of climbing and the related stories, but if I was, this would easily get a 9/10! All the actors portrayed their characters in the best possible way and I especially loved Jason Clarke, Jake Gyllenhaal and Josh Brolin who's becoming one of my favorites of late!On top of everything, thinking that this is an actual true story, gives you the chills. It's an easy going movie in the beginning when they begin the ascent, but as it progresses things get really tense and you're actually in the edge of your seat!Although I am having a hard time understanding why these people spend 65.000 to put themselves in danger or even die, is beyond me. Not the reasons but the stubborn way in which they pursue their dream without even having the right physical condition for it. Anyway, I think that merely the fact that I do feel like that, irritated, impressed, annoyed, etc. shows that this movie will certainly not leave you indifferent. It's a movie that gets you discussing and thinking about things which I think is the ultimate goal of every movie!",8,0,1,10 November 2015
3 Idiots," Unexpected
","Finding this movie and checking out the ratings, I was left a bit confused and wondering whether or not they came from all the Indians watching it. As it turns out, they didn't. This was an amazing movie, a movie that tackles more than one topics but focuses on the anxiety of young people studying, wondering what they are going to do with their lives. This is a global phenomenon and this is a great movie to watch early in your lifetime. I am not 20 or so, but it still taught me a thing or two and allowed me to objectively assess my situation in my work. I loved it. Humor is there in large doses, the scenery and landscapes are amazing and the movie is optimistic but also realistic at points. There are moments in the movie when you're laughing and in an instant you may find yourself crying. It was long but justified to be and it was never tiring, not at any point during the film. The actors were just brilliant and I think that this is one of the finest movies on Indian culture I have ever seen. If you also managed to miss it as I did, when it came out, now's the time to look for it and rent it. It's a must!",9,5,7,25 January 2016
Woman in Gold," Amazing - A punch to the stomach
","I think it's the best movie I have seen this year! Helen Mirren was simply breathtaking! A movie filled with history and amazing scenes from the Nazi era in Austria, a movie filled with the sense of justice and the longing for making things right. Ryan Reynolds was up to the task, although I was kind of fearful of whether or not he would manage to stand beside this great lady. I enjoyed the flashbacks of the movie, and really sympathized with the drama of the Jews of Austria. An amazing movie coming in a time when the extreme parties around Europe are growing exponentially, to show us what really matters in the end and how the horrific actions of the Nazis have ruined the life of so many people. In the end of the movie, you feel moved, you feel complete and you feel warm in the inside. I think that any movie that can offer these three things, is absolutely a '9' for me!",9,10,12,5 January 2016
Steve Jobs," Lacks a lot of background
","Michael Fassbender was awesome. I think that there will never be a better embodiment of Steve Jobs. I do. Kate Winslet (one of the most beautiful actresses for me) was also breathtaking. Apart from that, the movie itself was nothing special. I mean, if you don't know (and why should you) the story of apple inside out, there's no point in viewing this movie! I found the story really really confusing at times, which left me wondering about almost everything that was going on. First of all, I didn't appreciate the giant leaps that the movie took, breaching the continuity of the script. One of the factors that made me get lost this one. Apart from that, I am kind of confused what they are trying to depict here. Cause if it's the father-daughter relationship, then they failed. And if it was the mind-games, the plots, etc. behind Jobs' career, they failed again. Too many stuff in too little of screen time overall. What is the director after? Showing how Jobs was transformed as a father from a negative paternal figure to a positive one? This was not the case. The guy was only good to his child when she was playing with the Mac or later when he made it big time with the launch of the iMac. In the meantime, he was a shitty father. No role model there, no example for no one! Throughout the movie, Jobs was completely incapable of rising above his own misery or success, to face the needs of his child. And by the way, saying that he will put his daughter's music in her pocket, was not at all awesome or worth mentioning in the end. It did not mend anything. His child was just accepting his lousy character all along. I suppose that we will be expecting more and more Jobs movies in the years to come. I would wish the opposite. Why? Cause some stories are not worth telling, no matter how many apples are attached to them...",6,1,2,29 February 2016
Sausage Party," Had something going on but not anything special
","I am being generous with this rating I think. I am not an extreme hater or an avid fan. I would place myself in the middle of the spectrum. The movie has a really really interesting concept. I really liked the fact that food in the supermarket is kind of a metaphor for the human race (amazing work with the food by the way - amazing artwork there). I like the fact that religion is also part of the discussion etc. There were more than one times during the first half hour of the movie that I was actually impressed by the metaphors and the plot. After the first half hour though, the movie became a repetition of the same thing, totally predictable, with some glimpses of laughter and went down the hill overall. The ending was also as pointless as it could be. I think that this was one of these movies that kind of aims to go into depth with things and till a certain point it does, but in the end it goes too deep for anyone's taste. I would watch it again cause it seems like a movie I wouldn't want to miss, but the feeling in the end is that the movie promised more than it could deliver, or to be on the same context as the movie, it bit more than it could chew!",4,1,5,10 January 2017
Edge of Tomorrow," Although not a fan of Cruise, this movie rocked!
","I am not a fan of Tom Cruise, on the contrary I usually skip movies with him starring. This one was an exception for sure! I decided to give it a try and was not disappointed! He is really good in his role as is his co-star! It was a really really clever story! A sci-fi film that will surely pay off the time you spend watching it. Amazing effects, nothing too far fetched and overall really good acting and directing. It may be a bit dull in the beginning with the repetition that goes on, but once this is over, everything makes sense. Either you're his fan or not, give this movie a try and you will not be disappointed!",8,0,2,20 September 2015
Whiplash," Wow and then some more...!
","To be honest, at first I was a bit disappointed by the end, as I do not appreciate abrupt endings without some explanation or closure if you will. Then, returning home, I just sat on the couch smoking for nearly an hour, motionless, contemplating about the movie. The next morning, the same thing happened and since then, from times to times I go back and think of it again and again. This is how I know that this movie is at least a '9/10' for me. It's not that often that movies have a tremendous impact on me like this one. The movie itself was as fast-paced as a jazz masterpiece, mixing up emotions, changing pace and then leaving you with a feeling of awe. Simmons was AMAZING! Words cannot describe his acting in this one. Especially in the scene where he threatens to 'demolish' the guy entering his stage before a concert, was hilarious and intense at the same time! He managed to convey a character that really exists out there, pouring poison into the love of many many young artists for their art. All the cast gave their best effort, painting a canvas of intense emotions for the viewer. I easily put the movie up there with all the great 'music-themed' movies like the Pianist, the Red Violin, the Solist, the Legend of 1900, etc. I am not a jazz player or an instrument player whatsoever, so having a movie 'get to me' so much proves that this is a must see for everyone!",9,0,2,12 February 2015
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Nothing special - Overadvertised
","I sat down with great anticipation about the movie, I really did! In the end I just decided it was more or less a waste of my time. Not everything was that bad though. I really liked the photography and direction of the movie. Some of the shots were really really nice but overall I was left with a feeling of dizziness from all the weird angles. The storyline was OK but nothing special I would say. The acting from Keaton was exemplary as was the one from Norton and Galifianakis, but they alone could not save a movie that was (a) script less and (b) all over the place during most of the film. I did not appreciate the constant noise from drums and other instruments and I definitely did not like all this constant confusion. I liked the effect with the special powers and they way in which the director handled the taxi scene where you understand that he's just a man after all. I did not care for the mixed up ending as well. From my point of view, I think that what happened after the gun shot, was in his mind for this brief moment before he passed away. He did not shoot his nose from point blank and he did not miraculously lived from that! He can't have. This is a nice finding as well but we could do with a more concrete proof that indeed that's the ending. Having his daughter looking low and then high in the air and seeing him fly or not. No, that's just something I don't care about. I like my movies to end in the end and not go online and search about it, thank you very much. I did not like all the emphasis on the movie critic. She actually pushed him to suicide, doing nothing more in the movie, sitting there and drinking in the same bar, actually having 4-5 lines. What's that about? Is it to blame it on the theater critics in general? Is this a statement? I think not. As for Keaton, he is also a really fragile and strong character at the same time, with no will to live, hanging, barely on his own breath, trying to survive minute by minute. He has depicted really well his character, indeed, but it's the character himself that I did not like. What's he about? He's miserable and pathetic and then a theater critic pushes him over the edge and he just kills himself... Really? In general, all the characters were depicted on a superficial level (someone would expect the opposite them being actors and all) not allowing the viewer to relate or merely to understand their actions and pick sides. Having watched all the other Oscar nominated actors and movies, Birdman was a true disappointment of a movie. The only thing that saves the day is the performance of Keaton, even playing a character not worthy of much.",3,14,30,2 February 2015
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Just like a group of fans on acid brainstormed!
","Well, when you're a fan of the genre, no matter how much a movie sucks, you still find it hard to rate below 6. That's my case here. I went to the cinema on the premiere day for the 3D version, psyched about what I was about to see. In the end, I kind had half a smile on my face about it. Wow moments? Lots! Ben Affleck (CGI or not), was pumped! I am on the side of those that think that he was a decent, even more than that, batman. Have seen lots that were worse, I think Affleck is No2 behind Christian Bale. Another wow moment came with Wonder Woman. Nicely casted, gorgeous, almost taken out of a comic book! Other than that, superman was OK, but Jesse Eisenberg was awesome. I mean, this guy can act. From Social Network to Now You See Me, he has been so good! Overall, it seemed like the story was too much and too overloaded with stuff. The story of superman, the story of batman, then Lex Luthos with his plots, the story of Wonder Woman and so many additional things that paved the way for the sequel. It was too much to follow and it kind of broke the action and the storyline in too many fragmented pieces that you could barely follow. The fight in the end was nicely done although it could have been better and more realistic. It was too many explosions here and there and too much noise rather than good old fashioned fighting. Batman was poorly incorporated in it and only Wonder Woman kept her part. Don't go to the movies, wait for the DVD, but on the other hand, rating it below 6 is just mean on my part.",7,5,10,28 March 2016
Flight," You have to draw the line somewhere
","Flight is a really really provocative movie. It's an epic story of a man that is torn in the inside. Denzel Washington's performance is textbook. He's amazing, breathtaking. Throughout the movie, he's the most hateful character in my opinion, but at the same time he's a hero. A really well balanced movie between two extremes. A movie that balances between divine and devastation. He's probably the worst and biggest enemy of himself. He's many things but when the lies pile up that much, and when time comes to show if he'll once more let everyone down, he makes the right decision and gets rewarded for it. A reward that is not material in nature but more of a moral one. This movie is highly recommended. Highly!",8,1,2,5 December 2016
The Purge," Plain and simple amazing!
","When you hear about this movie, one thing sticks in your head. It's the concept of having a purge day (or a purge night if you will) every year. I mean, I am no fan, but it's some brilliant thinking right there on the part of the script writer. As an idea, it kind of immediately puts you in the center of the movie, starting to think what you would do in such a case.It also immediately sets the scene for the entire movie in an unparalleled way. I mean, you start of a sci-fi thriller with houses on lock down and a bunch of psychopaths roaming the streets with guns, with no police or law enforcement stopping them. That's the recipe for success right there. I loved the first one. Both Lena Headey and Ethan Hawke were amazing I think and the plot was also really interesting. Will not spoil anything, but it seems that the movie had the best possible ending. Overall, the concept will challenge the way we think about our civilized society. I mean, could you possibly think what would happen if this was also applied in real life? I am afraid to think. This movie kept me at the edge of my seat for the entire duration and this is something that I haven't said for a similar movie for quite some time.",9,0,5,12 July 2016
Deadpool," More than made up for Green Lantern!
","Amazing! One word. Amazing! This movie was by far one of the most action packed, funny and thrilling marvel movies I have seen in a very long time! Deadpool is an amazing character to begin with. Ryan Reynolds more than made up for the fiasco of Green Lantern with this one! I can't wait for a sequel! The movie had it all. Nice storyline, flashbacks that explained the history of the hero and lots and lots of jokes, funny, racial, you name it. A movie with no clichés, looking at the spectator more than once and with a decent result. Other movies that have tried to bring down the fourth wall have not made it - this one did!Would love to see more X-men in the movie but it's fine! As long as I see deadpool in the next X-men movie, I will be happy! Hurry and get to the cinema before it's out cause even the special effects are worth it! And then, just buy a DVD to have in your house! You'll never get tired of watching this one!",9,8,25,3 March 2016
Cloud Atlas," Special... Weird but special...!
","This movie is one of these that you need some time after the end to let them sink with you. It's a unique story, or more of a bundle of stories in different eras. I have to admit that during the three hours (15 minute short of 3 hours) of the film, I was constantly struggling to understand it! The stories themselves were pretty clear on their own but somehow I was not really into the message that the movie was trying to pass. It was really difficult to follow during the movie and to connect the dots. Tom Hanks was brilliant. For me, this movie served as a reminder of his greatness as an actor and his chameleon ability that has made him what he is. The effects were awesome and it was quite unique to see all these eras blending in one big story. I think that it was too spread out for my taste or in general. It was difficult for the viewer to keep a coherent perception in his mind while watching the film. It left me with a nice feeling, but still it's a bit cloudy even now, some days after watching.",8,1,2,26 July 2016
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Well, that's a different one...
","Well, this was a really nice movie! It started off as a really really serious movie with spies and everything and as it evolved, it also incorporated some humor along the way. It felt at sometimes as a movie that is targeted to teens, you know, the ones that are usually aired around lunch time on weekends. Overall it was this kind of a movie for me but one with a bit more realistic effects and nicer performances as far as the cast is concerned. It would be a 6 out of 10 for me but Colin Firth kind of saved it for me. I don't know why on earth he would do such a movie but then again, Piers Brosnan did the other one with the Greek gods (Persi or sth). Overall it was a nice feeling watching the movie but it's certainly one of those movies that you know that the trailer is as good as it gets and no matter what's in it, you won't be amazed by it. Especially some of the director's findings in the end, as well as the way he portrayed some of the killings in the end were not for my taste. Watch it if you have some time while you're eating your lunch on a Saturday afternoon. Nothing more, nothing less. Don't pay a cent to go to the movie theatre for this one. Not worth it, definitely not.",7,0,6,2 June 2015
Minions," No no no. You can do better...
","Well, needless to say, I love minions! From the first time they appeared on screen, I got really really obsessed with them. I think that along with the Penguins from Madagascar and Scrat from the Ice Age they are the best 'supporting' figures in such movies. When the movie was out, I rushed to the cinemas to watch it, along with some other 30 something geeks and of course lots of parents with their children, with the same immaturity I guess but with an excuse at least... The movie was disappointing. Apart from a few laughs at the beginning, at some point all this made-up language of the minions was too much and it began to tire me. The story was nothing too elaborate or crafted. It seemed like the simplest scenario they could get to get the movie out. I cannot pin point exactly what it was that did not cut it for me, but I think that the language part was quite significant. I would expect something more adult-appropriate, as let's face it, these movies are not just for kids anymore. It's a really really generous 6/10 from me for this one.",6,1,1,29 September 2015
Spectre," This is no James Bond
","No way. As much as I adored the previous one, this one was a complete and utter failure. Too complicated, with little if any assistance for the viewer to catch up with the previous. Too many effects with no substance. Poorly written and poorly executed. You would think that the James Bond recipe is simple and straightforward but as it seems, it's not. James Bond should be a fairly athletic lad, with some spy skills that kind of gets out of these situations using his mind. A pumped up, bodybuilder, ugly, not that clever altogether, that mainly uses the gismos of Q to do what is necessary, is a bad start. Daniel Craig is not James Bond material and this became more apparent in this movie where he didn't have the supporting cast needed or the script that would save the day... I did not appreciate the movie altogether and I really hope that this was his last movie so that the francise can pick up on its former glory and give us a good movie or two...",3,3,7,16 February 2016
The Nice Guys," Brilliant! Unexpected Ryan Gosling!
","I really enjoyed this movie. Really! The plot of the movie was a little confusing in the beginning but then it was pure pleasure! The characters were depicted by the leading actors in an amazing way. I really liked Russell Crowe that showed some of his comedy talents that were apparent already but I think that this was the first time I really enjoyed him in such a movie. Ryan Gosling was better than I expected, not that he's not a good actor but I was afraid that Crowe would overshadow him, which did not happen in the end. A really nice movie to watch, from another time with really nice costumes and overall a nice approach. Would really recommend for a relaxing evening with some laughs. The only downside was the plausibility of some things that happened in the movie that could be avoided keeping it more realistic.",8,2,5,25 August 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," Intense from second 1 to last...
","I was really really young when the first movie of Mad Max came out and it was kind of weird. I liked it back then but for obvious reasons it kind of scared me, so it was a bittersweet feeling back then. Watching this one, I kind of went down the memory lane and really enjoyed it! It was both nostalgic but also intense for me, and it did not let me down in terms of effects or the general feeling I had imprinted in my mind! The acting was OK, and I am not sure if it really matters. The movie is so action packed and intense that even less talented actors could have pulled it off I think. I was amazed by the costumes, the make up, the vehicles, everything! The music of the movie was so good! I liked the 'bad guys' as they seemed and were really really bad and I enjoyed every minute of the chase that goes on for almost the entire movie! The fiction part was there, but it's something you expect in such movies.I was really really close to rate it with a 9 out of 10, but I decided that an 8 is closer to the truth based on other movies of the genre. If I could, I would give an 8.5 to it!",8,1,8,21 September 2015
Warcraft," A bit lower than rated, but still solid
","Warcraft is an amazing theme upon which you can make a movie. It has really left a mark on millions of players worldwide, most of whom are now in their early or late thirties (or even more). I was amazed to see it come out and I was really intrigued by the trailer.In the end, having watched it, I think that the trailer promised a lot that the movie could not deliver upon. The movie lacked a nice introduction to the entire universe, the way LOTR was able to do it. There are tons of elements to show and explain and the movie just cut to the chase, which was something I did not appreciate. It could have built on the story more. The movie itself was nice. Really nice CGI, horrifying monsters, the works. I enjoyed every moment, although it could be a bit more stretched. Maybe even have a first part and a second one, all with the content from this one movie. Costumes were great, actors were also really nice, but still, it was a little to less compared to what the trailer offered.",8,1,1,11 October 2016
Me Before You," Real and fairy tale at the same time
","This was one of these movies that you find yourself trying to constantly remember that this is just a movie and that this is not happening in real life. Although this story is revolving around the serious injury of a person, it's really 'light' in the beginning and it actually gets more than some laughs out of you. And I think that when everything climaxes towards the end, this is the reason why you feel even sadder. Clarke was awesome as was her co-protagonist. All the cast was brilliant if you ask me. The questions set forth by the movie and the morals that are 'promoted' are irrelevant if you ask me. OK, it's always about living your life etc in movies like that. Doing things while you still can, not wasting time etc. But the thing that stuck with me in the end, is the feeling of this otherwise energetic young man, when he wakes every single day, having dreamed his life as it was before, just to realize that he's still in his bed, not able to walk, or take care of himself. I think that for me, that was the punch in the stomach. And with all this going on, to fall in love with a girl that embodies life itself, in such a unique way. His attitude and how he held together till the end, was the most touching part of the movie for me. The movie was brilliant. If you do decide to watch it, make sure that you're not in a really bad mood cause if you are, I can promise that it will really get you.",9,3,5,14 July 2016
Sully," Oops, they did it again!
","Well, Sally is one of those movies where you can just tell from the cast and director that it's going to be a heck of a movie! You just know.. I was reluctant myself to go to the movies and watch it cause it seemed more of a pay-per-view film to watch at home. It's not.It's masterfully made, keeps the sense of suspense high and although the movie is not revolving around the specific time that the accident took place, but goes beyond that point in time, it's still amazing. I loved all the flashbacks and leaps in time. Tom Hanks seems to be raising the bar over and over again and it won't be a surprise to see him get an Oscar for this. He depicted a determined, professional but deeply human pilot that managed to do what no one thought could be done. This movie is all about surpassing human limits and living up and beyond expectations. It's a movie about the real world and a real movie at the same time. It's a high-quality, high-fidelity and high- standard one. It's the best movie I've seen so far within 2016.",9,0,1,15 September 2016
Valkyrie," Nicely done! Thrilling!
","Haven't watched this one, although it's pretty old! I saw a trailer the other day and decided to watch it. Amazing movie. A really nice outlook on an aspect of Hitler's Germany that not many are aware of. I don't know if this is a propaganda or how much of the movie is true, but still it shows an aspect that is really interesting. The movie keeps you at the edge of your seat, anticipating what will happen next. It's amazing to see how Hitler affected Germany and how diverse were the feelings and opinions about him, even in his own ranks. It would be great to also see some of the inside secrets of the German dictator at the time, although the movie already shows enough. The actor playing Hitler was also pretty good!Nicely done with nice costumes and an incredible cast! Tom Cruze was really really good. I also loved Bill Nighy in his role. It's a movie that you must see!",7,0,1,31 October 2016
Draft Day," Classic sports' movie! Nice!
","I usually love any movie that is sport related, no matter the sport. This one was not an exception! Kevin Costner, was brilliant as was the remaining of the cast. I loved the countdown to the draft and especially how the movie was really intense during its final moments.A movie well-made with all the personal relationships being in the epicenter of the developments along with the cruel and pragmatic world of the draft. It was amazing to see how this process affects the life of everyone involved. The characters were depicted brilliantly by all actors and especially Kevin Costner and Denis Leary were awesome. A really nice movie to watch, especially if you're a fan of related films, but a movie that is also easy to watch by the non-fanatics, even if they have no clue about the sport itself.",7,1,3,26 July 2016
The Martian," Never wanted it to end!
","I took the time to read some of the criticism for this movie. I was amazed on how much people think they know, about physics, etc, and when they write two lines it's apparent that they would not know their left hand from their right one. But still, they go about it and write whatever comes on their mind. Yes, the movie may be a bit far fetched at some parts, but do you really think that the script writers did not have consultants from NASA or some kind of physicists? Really? I mean, OK some things were far-fetched but I guess they are all plausible or at least probable. Anyway, I am not a physicist, but a computer geek, and as such, I really enjoyed the movie and did not over think about Matt Damon's 'poop' or anything else. The movie is filled with nice humour, nice punch lines all over, and an amazing plot. The effects were amazing and overall it was an amazing package throughout, with nice acting, Matt Damon being literally transformed through the movie. I would watch it again given the chance! And please, please, stop whining about everything and just enjoy a sci-fi movie. It's called like that for a reason!",9,10,19,25 December 2015
