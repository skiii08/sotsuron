The Ring," Cheap Copy
","I have to say that I started in the wrong way. I say this because this was the first movie of the 'Ring series'(?) that I saw. I was truly disappointed as I exit from the movie theatre... I thought to myself if the novel itself was that bad. I considered various thing in 'The Ring' awful: the bits of story that were cut out (probably to make a revelation on the sequel), the cheap camera angles and the comic(!) terror scenes (it is the best qualification I can give them). Now, a week later I saw 'Ringu' and... I couldn't even TRY to compare! The fantastic camera angles, the unexpected (complete) story, the jump-of-your-sofa terror scenes and the symbolic stops (in which I mention - with applause -  the scene where father and son stop in the rain, which in The Ring has no special meaning).So, seeing 'The Ring', in my opinion, is a waste of time and I give it with no regret 2/10 (in the other hand, I highly recommend seeing 'Ringu' - 10/10!)",Null,0,1,14 March 2004
