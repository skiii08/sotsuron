Saturday Night Fever," Big, but only so-so
","Anyone living in the 70's saw this film, either at the theater (as I did originally) or later, on video (as I have also done). This film gave the world a new type of music that was hugely popular - that being, of course, disco. The Bee Gees, a struggling trio, revived their careers with disco. Other musicians made it big in disco. The music was, I believe, this film's strength. The acting was decent, but not great. The story, with variations, has been done ad nauseum. I thought some of the dialog was poorly written, stereotypical and condescending. There is a sense of desperation to 'make their mark' among the young people in the film that was pretty well portrayed. The dancing is pretty good, if you like that sort of thing (I don't, really). However, the rest of the film just doesn't have anything going for it. I think this is a decent flick but has a weak story with fair acting. Overall, not too bad, but hugely overrated, in my opinion.",6,1,2,8 March 2005
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A definite step backward
","This film came so long after the first group that many of it's viewers had never seen the first 3 episodes. The film is a step back in time and shows some of the characters at an earlier time than the previous 3 episodes. However, it's also a step backwards in quality. The script in this one is strong, but that strength just doesn't come across on the screen. Don't get me wrong...it's still a really good film, but it just isn't 'great' like the first 3. Perhaps our judgment is clouded by the fact that Lucas made everyone mad by making us wait so dadgum long for this film to appear. But at least the acting is marginally better than it was in Episode 1 and it is overall slightly better, but it still lags behind its older brethren. And that stupid Jar Jar is still in there.",6,2,4,27 November 2002
Ghost," A great tear-jerker
","Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore are perfectly cast as lovers in this film. Whoopi Goldberg as the Psychic is absolutely fantastic. The remainder of the cast also put in great performances. The film is about the ghost of a murdered man (Swayze) who is trying to protect his love (Moore) from the villian. He contacts the psychic (Goldberg) and uses her for various parts of his plan. Demi Moore's work in this film is about the best I have ever seen from her. The story moves along at a fairly decent clip, although there are a couple of short periods where I thought it dragged just a bit. The musical score is very good, with a stroke of brilliance in using the old Righteous Brothers Unchained Melody. Overall, a very well done flick and definitely worth a watch. I have read several other people's comments and I will join them in saying that I found that my eyes were leaking some sort of strange moisture after seeing this film. Well done!",Null,1,2,20 February 2001
Raiders of the Lost Ark," WOW! Whatta thriller!
","This film starts out fast and then picks up speed! There is action, drama and suspense throughout nearly all of the film. The viewer is barely able to catch his or her breath and off we go again! Harrison Ford is brilliant and maintains great intensity throughout the entire length of the adventure. And what an adventure they wrote for him to have! The lovely Karen Allen comes along for the ride and gets caught up in the adventure, too. There were three Indiana Jones films made and this one is the best of the lot. It's probably the most believable story, and the pace is, as I said, very fast. The basic story is that the Ark of the Covenant, containing the 10 Commandments, is in danger of being found by the Nazis. Indiana Jones goes on a journey to snatch this prize out from under the collective German noses. There is suspense, just a hint of humor and more action than a 10-ring circus. Steven Spielberg has another notch in his gun with this one. Altogether, a breathtaking achievement!",9,0,0,3 December 2002
United 93," Well done
","The events of 9-11 unfold in this film about one of the 4 hijacked planes that fateful day. While the other three aircraft hit their intended targets, the twin towers of the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, the fourth plane did not. It did not because the passengers took matters into their own hands and prevented it. The hijackers apparently didn't make any attempt to stop the passengers from talking on the 'air phones' and cell phones, and they learned from loved ones that America was under attack by hijacked planes. They (the passengers), of course, knew that yet another American target would be hit if they didn't act. They made the decision to attempt the wrest the plane back from the hijackers. Ultimately, the plane crashed in a field in Pennsylvania, but it didn't attack an American target. The acting in this film is really good, and the story well-written for the screen. Of course, the screenplay really works on the emotions of the viewer and it succeeds. I found it to be a very well-produced and directed drama.",8,2,4,15 June 2007
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," So good!
","This is one of a continuing string of blockbusters for director Steven Spielberg. ET is a well written, well executed, well acted, well directed, etc. film. The real stars of the film are all child actors and actresses, yet they all pull it off beautifully. The storyline is pretty basic: an ExtraTerrestrial (ET) is left behind on earth when it's space ship is nearly discovered by human scientists hot on their trail. The scientists discover that at least one being was abandoned and begin searching for it/them. Meanwhile, ET is looking for a place to hide and is discovered by a young boy, played by Henry Thomas. He takes ET in and hides him from his family. Meanwhile, the scientists are still trying to locate ET and are rapidly closing in. The result is a madcap chase that is part suspense, part magic. This is a truly great film and, although it's now over 20 years old, is still a favorite of a lot of people. Overall, an excellent FAMILY movie!",8,0,0,29 January 2005
Inglourious Basterds," WOW - what an action film!
","To say this film is a good film is to completely understate how good it really is. The basic plot has been reviewed by dozens of reviewers before me, so I'll not bother to wear my fingers out typing it again. I think that the best sequence in the film is the somewhat long one in the bar when the SS officer joins the commandos. You just know that 'it's' going to hit the fan any minute. It was drawn out just long enough to generate real tension yet not too long that the film drags. However, my favorite part was actually near the end, when the cooperative German officer gets his 'punishment'. Poetic, I'd call it. A great action yarn that will keep you entertained and that's a fact!",8,1,2,24 August 2012
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Swashbuckling good time
","I half expected Errol Flynn to appear at any time. Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightley head a fine cast in this rollicking adventure about a cursed pirate crew and their quest to undo the curse. I don't want to give the story away too much, but suffice it to say that Bloom figures prominently if unwillingly in that quest. Plenty of action and adventure along with excellent at-sea shots make this a well executed film. All in all, a great time!",7,1,2,2 February 2004
Happy Gilmore," Typical Adam Sandler
","....which means, dumb humor. There isn't a whole lot to recommend this film. It does have some funny moments, but overall, it's just silly, which is the genre in which Adam Sandler has excelled. This is the story of a guy named Happy Gilmore (Sandler) who believes he's a great hockey player just waiting to be discovered. Year after year he tries out for hockey teams and always fails. Basically, he's no good in hockey. His Grandmother's house, in the meantime, is in danger of being auctioned because Granny hasn't paid her taxes in several years. By accident, Happy Gilmore discovers that, using an unorthodox golf swing, he can hit the ball 2-3 times farther than the golf pros can. Ultimately, he ends up on the tour, trying to make enough money to save his Grandmother's home for her. Unfortunately, Happy's also in possession of a very hot raging temper, and this threatens to have him dismissed from the golf tour before he can raise the money. Overall, fairly well written and performed but just too dumb for my taste. I didn't realize that Carl Weathers, who plays a golf instructor in this one, needed the work that badly. I'm afraid I've got to give this one a thumbs down.",5,1,7,27 February 2006
Finding Nemo," Overall pretty good
","This is a well-executed film that is pretty entertaining. The animation is great (kudos to Pixar again) and the folks who provided the voices were spot on - except one, that is. The character Crush sounded like a VERY poor imitation of Sean Penn's Jeff Spicoli from Fast Times at Ridgemont High. I'm a huge fan of that film and so I didn't take to the imitation. Other than that, this is a thoroughly entertaining piece of work, and one that the folks who put it together can be proud of.",7,0,1,24 January 2004
Alexander," Alexander Great, Movie Stink
","This film was poorly written and directed. I was bored several times by overly long dialog leading to absolutely nothing. The battle scenes, called epic by some, are just plain too dang long. If epic means too long, then they are indeed epic. I felt that his mother had far too many scenes after he became grown and had taken off on his conquests. She wasn't adding anything necessary to the film in those scenes, so why keep them? There was definitely bisexuality in Alexander's relationships and it wasn't skipped over at all. Historically it seems to have been fairly accurate, and Alexander's story is a true classic. However, inept adaptation to the big screen along with uncharacteristically poor direction from Oliver Stone, lead to a film that is not only disappointing, but downright poor. Boring, boring, boring. I'm afraid this film just doesn't live up to all of it's hype.",4,3,4,27 September 2005
Troy," hyped and nearly lives up to it
","This film was heavily hyped and I believe many people were expecting more than they saw. Certainly this film was epic in scope and I thought was technically very well done. The story is the classic Iliad story as told by Homer. The acting is absolutely top-notch. Look for fantastic performances from Brian Cox, Brad Pitt, Diane Kruger, Peter O'Toole, Eric Bana and Brendan Gleeson. I don't see what caused people to give this film lower ratings. I thought it was quite good. There is awesome scenery, epic set design, love, action, battle, blood and gore aplenty, beautiful women, intrigue and suspense. What more can one film provide? Yet there is something missing, apparently. While initial Box Office returns were healthy, the film's final total was a disappointment to the Producer(s). DVD sales, however, seem to be fairly brisk. So this was a film NOT to see in the theater, but to see at home. I only gave this film an 8. I can't quite figure out what was missing but something was. (Stupid review, isn't it?). Overall, this is a very good film, but it just isn't quite what I expected it to be. Am I sorry I bought it? Not at all. I will watch this film at least 2-3 more times. Who knows, maybe I'll decide I like it better next time. Meanwhile, I give it an 8 and I think it'll be a popular film on DVD.",7,0,1,8 January 2005
Dead Poets Society," Yawn
","Perhaps I was not far enough removed from Robin Williams, the stand-up comic. Perhaps I was expecting some humor. Perhaps I was expecting a little life from the film. Instead, I was so bored, if I hadn't been with my wife, I'd have left the theater. Williams, for all his brilliance as a stand-up, is not funny in scripted roles. His acting is mechanical and no one else in this film stands out either. A total waste of two hours of your life.",Null,1,4,19 February 2001
Brokeback Mountain," Highly overrated
","This film was greatly overblown. I now wonder why it garnered so many Oscar nominations. It just didn't do much for me. This film is supposed to be this great emotional roller-coaster, but I wasn't able to get involved with the characters very much. I'm not quite sure where it went wrong for me. Perhaps the homosexuality did it, since, in my moral upbringing, that's a terrible sin. The acting wasn't at fault, as it was quite good. The cinematography shows a lot of beautiful scenery and that part was enjoyable. The story is pretty good as well. So I think the problem is just me thinking all the time that these guys are going straight to hell. And it just ruined the film for me. I've heard that if you're not bawling your eyes out at the end of this, you aren't human. Guess I'm a donkey or something, because my eyes were dry. Sorry, it just didn't click for me.",6,1,25,1 August 2006
Insomnia," Pretty absorbing film
","This film is a pretty good one. It's absorbing insofar that it draws in the viewer. The acting is pretty good by everyone, but no one really shines in this one. That often hurts a film with a big name in it (in this case, Pacino), but not in this case. Rather, it's a collaborative effort and the film benefits from the combination of talents. The story is engrossing enough to hold the viewer and the sheer beauty of Alaska definitely helps in keeping the viewer's interest, too. Definitely worth a rental.",7,0,0,28 November 2002
The Day After Tomorrow," Good
","This is entertaining, though difficult to believe. Basically, the earth's climate changes abruptly (like nearly overnight). While I believe that global warming is a reality, this is too much. However, if you can ignore the fantastic, the film is OK. The acting is adequate, although no one particularly shines. The special effects are pretty decent, although the sudden freezing of everything isn't terribly good. The story is pretty well written, and should be a warning to everyone that our climate is changing because of our insatiable demand for fossil fuels. It's definitely an ecological wake-up call. I almost bought this but decided to rent instead and am glad I did. It's not a 'keeper' for me. Others will really enjoy it more than I did. It's definitely not a bad flick, but it misses the chance to be better.",7,0,1,13 October 2004
A Bridge Too Far," OK but not particularly good
","One of the most glaring problems with this film is that Ryan O'Neal was far too young looking to be a General. Otherwise, it's a pretty fair but long film. This is the true story of Operation Market Garden, an assault that was designed to propel the Allies deep into German-held territory and capture key bridges over canals and rivers. I think the combat scenes were overall pretty well done. Michael Caine does a fine job in his role as the leader of the ground assault that is supposed to relieve the paratroopers. Trouble is, those pesky Germans put up a lot more of a fight than was expected (mainly due to faulty Allied intelligence as far as what German units were in the area). There was also some stupidity portrayed on the Allied side. Result, the ground units never reached the British paratroopers at the last bridge. (Hence the title A Bridge too Far). As I said, the film is overall pretty well done. This film just didn't grab me and I consider it to be a run of the mill (albeit LONG) war film. I gave it a 6.",5,3,9,14 November 2002
The Terminator," Good action flick
","This is the opening act of the highly successful Terminator series. A machine, programmed to kill a certain target, is sent back from the future. In the future, machines have taken over the world and are exterminating the human race in a huge war. Arnold Schwartzenegger stars as the Terminator and Linda Hamilton as one of the targets. The machine's incessant behavior is excellently portrayed by Arnold and he is definitely one bad boy in this film. He kills everyone in a police station to get at his target. There's lots of good action and the story is excellent. There's also a bit of a caveat for man - don't give machines too much power over you! Overall, pretty good!",7,1,3,8 March 2004
Gettysburg," Wow!
","What a film! This one grabs you right from the start and keeps you. And it needs to-it's a long film. The film is fairly accurate, historically, and was shot partially on location. The performances of Martin Sheen as General Robert E. Lee and Tom Berenger as General James Longstreet are nothing to get excited about, especially during one scene where both of them deliver their lines very woodenly. Nearly everyone else in the film is great! The most galvanizing performance is that of Jeff Daniels as Colonel Joshua Chamberlain. I'd have followed him into hell, which his men did. The battle scenes in this film are truly epic in size and the cinematography is brilliantly executed. When all those dozens of Confederate cannon fire one by one, it made me feel as if those cannonballs were headed for me. The soundtrack is spectacular, particularly if you have DTS 5.1! I gave it a 9 only because I felt that Sheen & Berenger could have done a little better. But it is truly one of the great war films of all time.",9,7,7,5 September 2000
We Were Soldiers," Pretty decent
","Why does everyone have to compare every Mel Gibson film to Braveheart?Based on a book by the same title, it is a decent film that deals truthfully with the first major battle between US Army soldiers and the North Vietnamese Army. The book was written by Col. Hal Moore (Mel Gibson) and Joe Galloway (Barry Pepper). The film is balanced in it's approach in that it is related from both sides. The way it was written shows a great deal of respect for the commanders and troops on both sides. It is brutally bloody, with liberal use of blood spatters on the camera lens and definitely earns it's R rating. It is a story of leadership and brotherhood. Before going off to 'Nam, Col. Moore (Gibson) tells his men that they will eventually be fighting for each other. During the training of his officers, he keeps stressing teamwork, brotherhood and respect for the men. The film continues to pound that thread home and all of the men learn to appreciate that fact in battle. This film is set in 1965, when the first combat troops were sent over to protect the advisors. The military wasn't prepared for the losses incurred; there was no plan in place to notify the families of those killed in action. Instead, the Yellow Cab company was used. I felt sorry for the cabbie in this film who had to deliver the bad news all too often. The film starts with us meeting some of the characters, their wives and children, so when bad news arrives for some of the wives, it's more emotional for the viewer as well. An altogether decent Vietnam film (FINALLY!). The acting is, for the most part, pretty decent, especially by Barry Pepper and Sam Elliot among the men and Madeline Stowe and Keri Russell among the women. The combat sequences are huge, prolonged, bloody and quite brutal, and it shows the bravery of both the American troops and the North Vietnamese as well. Those of us who weren't there can't possibly comment on how accurate this story is. In the special features, the men who were there say it's pretty accurate and I believe them. It's a significant film that's well worth a watch.",8,1,2,25 August 2002
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Absolutely absurdly wonderful
","I thought I had seen this film a long time ago, but I hadn't. So I just got around to seeing it. This is a great film. The late, great Peter Sellers plays 3 different roles and does them all beautifully. George C. Scott also stars in this this farce. A mad US General gives his airborne aircraft the go-ahead to deliver a nuclear strike against the Soviet Union. Slim Pickens is the aircraft commander who doesn't receive the recall command and continues onward towards his target. The film is in black and white, which adds to it's overall affect, taking place during the Cold War. It also serves as a reminder that very few things, including nuclear war, are black and white. Overall, a film that is destined to become a classic, if it isn't already.",9,0,1,14 July 2006
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Yet another great film
","This film continues in the same vein as Episodes IV and V and appeared initially to be more or less 'The End'. Rumors abounded that no more Star Wars films would be made. Of course, that turned out to be untrue and the series continues, but XVI (16) long years would pass between Episode VI and Episode I. Anyway, back to Episode VI. The SFX, basically unchanged since the first film 6 years earlier, are by now beginning to pale in comparison to other films, yet somehow, they are still adequate for this one. This film also marked the end of our now-familiar characters, Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader, Han Solo, Chewbacca and Princess Leia. Lucas sure left us hanging at the end of this one. Would the series continue? Whatever became of Luke and company? It looks like we'll have to wait until Episode VII comes out!",8,0,1,27 November 2002
MASH," I prefer the TV series
","I hate to be a wet noodle, in contrast to most of the other comments, but I didn't see the film until after I'd seen a couple of seasons of the TV series. By that time, only Alan Alda could be Hawkeye, etc. The characters in the film make more fun of the patients than they did on TV. The only character that came through pretty much the same was Sally Kellerman's Hot Lips Houlihan. She and Loretta Swit must have gone to the same acting school. I was unable to identify with the film characters as much as I had already connected with the TV characters of mostly the same names. Now don't get me wrong...this film is very good and has many memorable scenes in it. I just saw the film a lot later than many others did and that has affected my review.",6,10,20,1 January 2003
Alien," Wow!
","This is the benchmark for Science Fiction films to aspire to attain. The film's Director, Ridley Scott, already a 'known', was catapulted into the forefront with this one, along with the entire cast. The acting in this film is superb by the entire cast, but most especially Sigourney Weaver, Tom Skerrit and Ian Holm. The fact that the entire cast consists of only 9 or 10 characters must have made it easy to work together. The special effects work is absolutely first-rate also. The action comes thick and fast after a sort of slow but necessary start. Once it begins, hold onto your hat! Alien is, far and away, the best film of it's genre that I've seen in years.",8,0,1,28 January 2005
The Doors," sort of OK but disjointed
","This film tells the story primarily of Jim Morrison, the singer/poet leader of The Doors and they would prove to be one of the most influential rock groups of the 1960's. Their songs were mainly based on Morrison's poems as lyrics and touched the social conscience of America. It didn't take long for Morrison to embrace drugs and alcohol as a means to 'expand his mind' and he became unpredictable, unstable and he began to withdraw from reality. As the drugs began to affect him, his lyrics became blacker; increasingly rambling, violent and focusing on sex and death. Onstage, his performances became the stuff of legend, vulgar and nonsensical at times and he began a downhill spiral in his personal life as well as popularity with the fans. The drugs and alcohol ultimately killed him at age 27. The film, directed by Oliver Stone, is a stuttering thing, perhaps mirroring Morrison's life. The descent into hard drugs, his alcohol excesses, sexual escapades and depravity are all portrayed very well. I think that Mr. Stone actually overdid some of the excesses, but perhaps it is more truthful this way. I believe that the film was well-cast and acted. Val Kilmer pulls off Morrison well and Meg Ryan does a creditable job as Pam, the long-term love interest. The musical score is, of course, mainly Doors music.",6,4,8,11 July 2005
Full Metal Jacket," A lot of you missed the point
","Many of those who have written comments about this film have talked at length about how absurd the use of the Mickey Mouse club song by Kubrick. One of the major terms used in the military in general to refer to the usual military B.S. is 'Mickey Mouse'. Some have commented on the obscenity and childishness of the marching songs sung during boot camp. Well, those are PRECISELY the songs we sang while marching. Kubrick has created a really realistic film here and many of the commenters are not qualified to write about it since they never experienced it. So, that said, the performances of the entire cast are brilliantly executed. A true stroke of genius was casting Lee Ermey as SSgt. Hartman, the Senior Drill Instructor. He was recently retired from the Marine Corps and was very convincing! The main star of the film was Matthew Modine, whom I regard as one of the finer actors around today. His performance generated a real personality on screen for Private Joker, such as  sitting around the barracks just before they are attacked by the NVA talking tough, but moments later saying he's not ready for combat. Kubrick very skillfully uses the first half of the film to show the transformation of the recruits from civilians to Marines. We don't get to know the recruits very well, excepting Privates Joker and Pyle, but the mix of characters is carefully selected. The fact that we don't know these recruits very well reflects the fact that they are all bald and that boot camp dehumanizes people. Contrast that with the second half, which depicts the horror of the Vietnam War. The character mix in the second half is more important as that in the first and the characters are more developed. Overall, Kubrick's best film ever. A solid 9.9999999 out of 10.",Null,0,0,24 January 2002
Glory," Glory-ous!
","This is a terrific semi-historical film set during the Civil War. Matthew Broderick portrays Colonel Robert Gould Shaw, who trained the first fully combat-ready Black Regiment for the US Army. This film depicts the history of the 54th Massachusetts and how they (including the White officers leading them) were disliked and even hated on BOTH sides. I think many people assume that the citizens of the North all loved black people and wanted to see them freed. The truth is, there were a lot of Northerners who were at best disinterested in the plight of the black people. Shaw had to fight a great deal of racism to get his men any basic equipment, uniforms and the right to become combat soldiers and subsequently to actually be utilized in battle. The Regiment ultimately made a strong contribution to the Union war effort. The film is superbly cast and very well acted. There are few really memorable scenes in the film, but there is one great scene between Trip (Denzel Washington) and Rawlins (Morgan Freeman). I thought that Jihmi Kennedy did a fine job as Jupiter Sharts as did Andre Braugher as Thomas Searles. I highly recommend this film to anyone!",9,0,0,21 December 2000
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Almost Ho-Hum
","Alas, it had to happen. Lucas made a Star Wars film that, to my mind, was almost boring. The films execution is OK...pretty much average for a film made in 2002, so it's not state-of-the-art. First time THAT'S happened. The acting in this film is actually pretty lame. NO ONE stands out in this film. All the others had some great acting but not this one. Yoda didn't SOUND like Yoda. Sure they used the same guy to do the voice, but he didn't sound the same. Still, the film has bright spots in it and it serves to pique the interest in the next one. I just hope it's a little better than this one was. I probably won't buy this one. I may rent it again sometime. And what the heck is an idiotic character like Jar Jar doing in it - it's presence only serves to take away from any seriousness the film might have had.",6,1,2,27 November 2002
Forrest Gump," Good but not great
","I found this to be an entertaining film, certainly. However, I just don't see it as one of the top 250 films of all time. Tom Hanks does a great job playing Forrest Gump throughout the film. Sally Field as his mother is also quite good, so the problem isn't with the acting. The story is a shade weak, I think. It skips around a good bit and ends up slightly disjointed. Overall, the story is OK, but not 6 Academy Awards worth. It's trying to preach a sermon about ordinary (or less) people being able to make it, yet the message gets lost in the rambling story. I just don't think it was quite in the league that it currently finds itself in. All in all, a very good film, but not a great one. Looks like I'm in the minority, though!",7,2,5,30 January 2004
"Monsters, Inc."," This is a great film!
","I'm not big on animated films but I truly like this one! The story revolves around monsters who must scare human children to get their screams since screams provide all the electrical power for the monster society. Monsters utilize the child's closet door as a portal. However, children don't scare easily anymore and production has dropped off. There's also the fact that monsters believe that human children can kill a monster with just one touch. So there's great danger when a child actually comes through the closet door and into monster society! One monster befriends the lost human and is trying to return her to her own bed. But there's evil afoot at Monsters, Inc, the monsters power company and the bad monsters want to keep the child. This is a cute film, and I liked it!",8,0,1,22 March 2003
The Godfather: Part II," A *great* sequel!
","I've never seen a sequel that was as good as the original...until now. This film is every bit as good as The Godfather and it's because it features nearly everyone from the original film. Obviously, since their characters died, neither Marlon Brando nor James Caan are back (except a little in flashbacks), but Al Pacino reprises Michael Corleone, James Cazale is Fredo, Robert Duvall is Tom, Diane Keaton is Kay and Talia Shire is still Connie. Very importantly, also back is Francis Ford Coppola as director! The acting is again first-rate as is the direction from Coppola. The script is again powerfully written and that power comes through on screen. This film goes back into the Corleone family background in Sicily and has a bit less action than the first film. There isn't as much violence, but if you've seen the first film, you know all about that already, so it's not really as necessary. I believe that this film more or less presupposes that you've seen the first film. However, this one never drags! It's a great film and I intend to own a copy as long as I live!",10,0,1,2 February 2003
The Bourne Identity," A shell of the book
","In some cases, the film is better than the book, but this isn't one of them. This isn't a bad film, it's just that the book is much better, mainly due to details. The film lacks many of the small details that Ludlum so carefully adds to his writing. What this film has is an excellent cast, Matt Damon, Chris Cooper, Brian Cox and US-unknown Franka Potente. These folks all do a creditable job in this film and the basic story is a strong one, but it just lacks so many details that Jason's story is never told in any depth...of course, in a way, that's the premise of the film. Still, the film is only a shell of the book. Ludlum writes a lot of detail into his books and that's what makes them so interesting. I might watch this film again, but I won't hurry to do so.",6,0,1,3 March 2003
The Italian Job," Decent remake
","This is a remake, albeit with a slightly different heist, of the 1969 film by the same name starring Michael Caine. The thieves still use Mini Coopers for their getaway, true to the original film. Drop-dead gorgeous Charlize Theron and Mark Wahlberg are the two main characters if you don't count the cars! !! SPOILER ALERT !! I'd hoped to see more of one of my favorites, Donald Sutherland, but his character (Bridger) gets killed fairly early in the film. After a heist, a gang member double-crosses the rest and kills Sutherlands character and believes he's killed the rest. The remainder survive and plot their revenge. They enlist the aid of a beautiful safecracker (Theron), who happens to be the daughter of Sutherlands character, Bridger. What happens next is detailed planning and execution of their heist to extract their revenge. Will they pull it off?",6,0,1,14 December 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A great film
","I've been a Tolkien fan for thirty years, having worn out a couple of copies of each of the books. One regret is that Jackson chose not to make The Hobbit first...it would have been fun to follow Bilbo to the Lonely Mountain to see Smaug and learn more in-depth about the Ring. Alas, he didn't...however, he did a great job with the Fellowship of the Ring! The production is grand in both scale and execution. The SFX are, for the most part, very good. Makeup and costuming for the host of Orcs and the Uruk-Hai, is fantastic. The location (New Zealand) was superb and the cinematography is first-rate. The film varies from the book a little, to it's (slight) detriment, I believe. The theatrical version leaves Tom Bombadil out completely, skips Gimli's infatuation with Galadriel and Galadriels gifts to the Fellowship members, some of which are important later. The extended DVD version puts some of that back in plus other interesting stuff. There is some other material that had to be omitted simply to keep the film to a manageable length. However, the remainder of the film is a fantastic achievement, fairly true to the book, that ended all too soon. I am anxiously awaiting The Two Towers! I've heard that the second chapter of the trilogy is even more grand than the first. I can't wait!",8,0,0,17 December 2002
Radio," Super film
","I avoided watching this film for a while because it had what I thought was a kind of stupid title. I now rate the film among my favorites. I should have known it would be a great one. Any film with either Cuba Gooding or Ed Harris is going to be good and this film has not one, but both of them. The film is based on a true story. Gooding is superb as the 'town dummy', a mentally-retarded teen aged boy who is fascinated by a radio (hence the name) and the local high school football team. The kids on the team, being dumb teen aged boys, pick on him, eventually going a bit too far for the coach's (Ed Harris) liking. He disciplines the ringleaders and, to add insult to injury, gives Radio a job with the team. As time goes on, the team learns to accept him and he still does that job today, a couple decades later. I hate to use the word 'heartwarming' since that usually means 'sappy', but this one isn't at all sappy. All in all, a totally enjoyable film!",8,2,2,6 March 2007
Cast Away," Excellent movie!
","Tom Hanks makes another blockbuster...how do he do dat? Pretty much anything that Hanks touches is a huge hit! Sure, he's a great actor, but that can't explain his phenomenal success. Anyway, this is yet another great film starring Tom Hanks. He's by far the major player in this film, considering that he's alone on an island for much of the film. He's cast perfectly and he delivers perfectly. The story has been reviewed dozens of times, I'm certain, so I'll not go into that. The film is a commentary on the resiliency of man. And casting Hanks was a very smart move!",8,0,0,20 December 2002
Armageddon," Interesting
","A pretty good story with a decent cast, this film is pretty entertaining. The acting is pretty good throughout and the story is sort of realistic. I suppose most of what they did could be done given today's technology. Michael Clarke Duncan is noticeable in this film, even though it was shot a year before his blockbuster, The Green Mile. Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck, Billy Bob Thornton and Liv Tyler all turn in pretty good performances as well. Overall, an entertaining flick and one that I think most folks would enjoy.",7,1,2,29 January 2004
Cold Mountain," Over-hyped
","This film is NOTHING like the previews, which sucked me in believing I was going to see a war/romance flick. There's very little war in it. After 55+ years, I should learn to ignore previews! This film is mostly about an improbably sappy romance between Jude Law's character and Nicole Kidman's character. They barely know each other yet profess eternal love, etc. Law goes off to fight on the Confederate side of the Civil War, leaving poor Kidman to wait for him. Then Kidman's father, well portrayed by Donald Sutherland, dies, leaving poor Nicole all alone and unprepared to run the family farm. Law is seriously wounded, but in true hero fashion, DESERTS the army and begins the journey home to his squeeze. Meanwhile, Renee Zellweger's character shows up to help Nicole Kidman with the farm. The contrast between the two characters is very sharp and interesting. This film is OK but I sure would like to know what all the fuss was about. It's good, but not THAT good. I don't understand all the Academy Award nominations. I saw no glaring errors in the film and the historical part (that little bit of war that they showed) was pretty accurate with regards their treatment of the 'Battle of the Crater'. I gave this film a 6 and that's what it deserves. It is good but definitely not great.",8,1,1,8 July 2004
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Ho-hum
","The Terminator series went one film too far and this was that film. This film lacks the cohesion that it's older brethren had. The acting is so-so, the plot boringly similar to the other two. The film has plenty of action, as all the Terminators do, but other than that, it's just not a keeper. Hopefully no one will resurrect this series when Gov. Arnold is finished saving California. This series should be TERMINATED!",6,0,0,13 January 2004
Doctor Zhivago," A masterpiece
","This is one of the great films of all time. It is a love story, set in Russia with the backdrop of World War One and the Russian revolution. It is a beautiful love story, yet at the same time, is one of the most depressing films I've ever seen. The story and the acting are extremely powerful. Julie Christie gives the performance of her life as does Omar Sharif. The cinematography is spectacular and the screenplay one of the best ever. Altogether, a strong package and one not to be missed!",8,1,2,14 December 2003
U-571," Not bad, not great
","U-571 is a pretty fair yarn. There are a few plot holes, not the least of which is that it was the British, not the Americans, who grabbed an Enigma machine. There were a couple more technical problems, but nothing that couldn't be overcome. The acting was pretty doggone good, I thought. I thought the best performances came from Bill Paxton, Jon Bon Jovi, Harvey Keitel and Matthew McConaughy. The basic story has been covered by others, so I'll not bother with it here. There is enough drama and action to keep anyone interested (well, people who like that sort of thing anyway). It's a story of survival, of courage, respect and teamwork. Overall, it's an entertaining piece of work. This is a film well worth a rental when you're in the mood for some adventure.",7,1,2,16 October 2000
"I, Robot"," Not bad at all
","8 out of 10 for a well-written and executed story. The cast does a good job, although there are only 3 real stars, Will Smith, Bridget Moynahan and Alan Tudyk. This is the latest (but certainly won't be the last) in a long series of books and films dealing with machines deciding that they've had quite enough of human chicanery. Isaac Asimov's book is well adapted to film, with enough detail getting through to make the film work. Best of all, it doesn't ever SEEM like they're feeding you this detail. The film is set in the future (circa 2035), when robots are fast becoming accepted and, in some instances, irreplaceable. Then, a murder occurs and it appears to have been committed by a rogue robot. Only Will Smith (a Detective), believes this. Everyone else is convinced that robots must obey the 3 laws which would prevent them from harming a human. As Smith investigates a bit further, aided by Moynahan, albeit reluctantly at first, the truth becomes even more frightening. Have the robots been programmed to ignore the 3 laws in order to take over control? Smith must get to the bottom of things before the new line of robots takes over the earth!",8,0,1,4 April 2006
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Change of role
","In the first film, Arnold Schwartzenegger's character is sent back to kill John Connor by killing his mother before John is born. The second installment has Arnold coming back still as a Terminator, but now his job is to protect a now teenaged John Connor from a more advanced Terminator. Linda Hamilton reprises her role as Sarah Connor, John's mother. The film has lots of action and is certainly not going to put anybody to sleep! I believe this film is actually better than the original, which is a rarity for a sequel. The acting is better and I think the special effects are much better. The advanced Terminator is made of liquid metal and some of it's tricks are definitely cool! I like this flick.",7,1,2,8 March 2004
Apocalypse Now," Whew!
","This is one powerful antiwar film! The production was nearly derailed by a number of events (typhoon, major star (Martin Sheen) having a heart attack during production, other major star (Marlon Brando) showing up not ready, going way over budget), but I'm thankful that it was ultimately completed. The film world is a better place because of this film's existence. The film is very 'deep' and can't fully be understood or enjoyed in one viewing. You should see it, think about it for a few weeks or months, then see it again. This film has several combat scenes but make no mistake, it is an ANTIwar film. I feel that the depiction of many of the US soldiers as spaced-out, drunk, unruly and overall un-military is way overdone. Certainly there were a few like that, but the majority of the US military at that time were a definite step above that level (I know - I served alongside them). All in all, Coppola's production came out brilliantly. Judging by the fact that it was recently RE-shown at the Cannes Film Festival, others also think so. Watch this one - TWICE! It's a significant film!",9,1,1,20 December 2002
The Patriot," Braveheart with muskets
","Only a 6 for this one. I hate to compare it to Braveheart, (since nearly every Mel Gibson action movie is) but the similarities are too obvious not to. The two films start basically the same, with Gibson playing a pacifist. Both have epic-proportion battle scenes that take up too much of the film and make the film overly long. There are a few inaccuracies also. By this late in the war, the Continental Army and the Militia were in dire need of all sorts of military equipment, such as uniforms, shoes, etc. None of which is reflected in this film, with everyone being well fed and dressed. The acting is pretty fair, with surprisingly strong performances from the children. Jason Isaacs as Col. Tavington, also gave a very good performance. I rented this film and may do so again, but it is not a great film. It is, however, a good one. I'll stick by my original statement - it's Braveheart with muskets.",6,0,2,16 December 2000
Face_Off," Highly overrated
","I don't see why this film is rated so highly here. The acting is decent, but with Travolta and Gage, I would expect that. The story is pretty lame, the script slow and altogether, it nearly put me to sleep. I believe this one is overrated. There isn't really much of a reason to see this film at all, in my opinion. A real sleeper - YOU, not the film. YAWN!",5,1,3,30 January 2004
Jarhead," Hoo-rah...not!
","If this is really what the Marine Corps is like today, it's no wonder everybody's kicking the US's butt wherever we go. These guys were portrayed as weak in many cases. These guys were cracking up before they went into combat at all. I'm sorry, but when I was in, the Corps was a bunch of tough men. Vietnam was our war...and there was beaucoup action there! The depiction of those Marines in this film almost made me sick. Sure, Marines are human beings and have feelings. Sure there are Dear John letters from the girl who was going to wait for you. But you get over it and move out. This clown got all crazy and he wasn't the only one. Gunney Washburn, PLEASE WHIP THESE WIMPS INTO SHAPE because someone didn't do it. As for the film....well, it was pretty well photographed. It was, overall, a very depressing thing for me to see. I guess the acting was good to evoke such a response from me.

Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Hmmmmmm
","This is not the Harry Potter that we've come to expect. This kid, and his friends Hermione and Ron, have become rebellious...like todays teens. Of course, they ARE teens now. But they've actually become disrespectful, yelling SHUT UP to adults and generally acting a bit too much like I see kids doing everywhere. It make it a bit more difficult to actually LIKE the kids the way we have in the past. The story is, as usual, very good, the acting first-rate and the special effects are better than the previous films. There is a little less 'wonder' built in, with emphasis on the story and characters rather than the magical stuff at Hogwarts (floating candles and the like). The tone of this film is a good bit darker than the previous two also. However, I still enjoyed watching it and will, as always, eagerly await the next installment of the Harry Potter series. However, I only gave it a 7 out of 10 because of what I cited about the attitudes of the kids.",7,1,7,26 December 2004
Gandhi," Kingsley's best work to date
","Ben Kingsley stars as Gandhi, who nearly singlehandedly won the independence for India from the British Empire. Kingsley gives an extremely powerful performance in this as the peaceful but determined Gandhi. In fact, I believe that this is probably the best acting I've seen him do - ever! Candice Bergen portrays Margaret Bourke-White, a highly respected and talented photographer, who was there to record parts of the drama for the world to see. Directed by Richard Attenborough, it won the 1982 Best Picture award, winning over the blockbuster ET, which was expected to win the big award.",9,4,9,30 January 2004
Pearl Harbor," Not as good as it should have been
","Read my lips - too dang long! The story is weakened mainly because of the length. It would have been much more intense had it been shorter. The acting is for the most part good, although I thought Alex Baldwin was asleep at the wheel as Jimmy Doolittle. This is countered by strong performances from Kate Beckinsale, Josh Hartnett, Ben Affleck and a truly outstanding job by Jon Voight as President Roosevelt. The ships used in the film were all wrong, with the aircraft carriers having angled flight decks, which were not developed until after the war (and then by the British). In addition, none of the Japanese carriers which took part in the Pearl Harbor raid had large portside island structures, which the ones in the film had. The ships shown at Pearl Harbor before the raid included modern US Navy Perry-class frigates. They should have used models for reality! But overall, the film tried to encompass too much of the war. It could have been a much more powerful film if they'd ended it as Roosevelt was declaring war. But they had to keep going and went way too far. The entire second half of the film occurred several months after the Pearl Harbor attack and therefore didn't belong in this film at all.",7,0,1,15 December 2001
Dirty Dancing," Altogether enjoyable!
","The basic plot's been written up several times, so I'll not write it up again. This film has excellent music and dance - plain and simple! The relationship between Baby and Johnny is in there for the women, who demand some romance in every film. The film is mainly about how hung up everyone was in the early 60s and how kids used to 'dirty dance' behind their parents' collective backs. I grew up in this time, although the dancing that my friends and I did wasn't quite as 'dirty' as what was depicted in this film. But it was still 'lewd' according to the older generation. Remember, these were the folks who wouldn't allow Elvis to be shown below the waist on TV for another couple of years. So I knew the whole mindset and the scene firsthand and it brought back a few memories! I loved this film and gave it a solid 8.",8,1,2,14 December 2003
The Dirty Dozen," A good 'un
","As we say in the South, this is a good 'un. The film has an all-star cast, including Lee Marvin, George Kennedy (albeit briefly), Clint  Walker, Jim Brown, Donald Sutherland, Telly Savalas and Charles Bronson. The plot: take a bunch of hardened and/or condemned military criminals and turn them loose on the Nazi High Command. Along the way, they have to prove themselves to their commander (Marvin) and the American commanders. There are a few comic moments, but most of the film is straight-away action. I like it!",7,3,7,19 March 2003
Gone with the Wind," Vivian Leigh's best work
","This is a stunning film, especially considering it's vintage. Vivian Leigh does the best work of her career in this film. Clark Gable is pretty fair in this as well, but this isn't his crowning moment, at least in my opinion. The story is grand, the characters all larger than life and the cinematography is among the best ever done. Leslie Howard as Ashley Wilkes and Olivia de Havilland as Melanie also give strong performances. This one should be the standard against which all other films are judged - it's that good!",8,1,2,4 February 2004
Days of Thunder," So-so
","The role of Cole Trickle was perfect for Tom Cruise - PERFECT! And he played it nearly perfectly. The acting by everybody (Duvall, Kidman, Thompson) is all very good. I can't quite figure out where this one goes wrong. The story isn't great but it's pretty fair. Bottom line, I just didn't think much of it. Sorry, but that's the way I feel.",6,4,8,3 August 2003
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," A poor endeavor
","Jackson and company took such great pains to remain true to the books in their rendition of The Lord of the Rings, but apparently had no such attachment to The Hobbit. Making The Lord of the Rings (aka the Trilogy) as 3 films was a no-brainer, since it encompasses 3 books in most printed versions. The Hobbit is, in contrast, a single book, yet they're milking the project for every penny by stretching it out (and BORINGLY SO) to 3 films. The first half of this film is a complete snorer! Far, far too long with no action other than a bit of a food fight in Bag End. Next, while the Trilogy had lovable characters in Aragorn, who is noble, yet humble. The 4 hobbits in that film were all well-developed character-wise and thus became popular due to their love of the hero, Frodo, brave but reluctant. In this film, we're supposed to love a batch of dwarfs who are coarse, boisterous, and only after gold. There is nothing noble in their quest at all. Richard Taylor and company did a great job again with the props and the weapons, but I thought the animation, particularly some of the digital work, was below the standard set by the Trilogy. Once the pace picked up, the action picked up as well, with lots of fighting. Unfortunately, I found some of the fights to be too kung-fu movie like. Some of the falls, such as the fall of the bridge in the Goblins lair, would have definitely killed any living thing, yet the dwarfs all hop up and start fighting again without so much as a groan. Too many characters who shouldn't be in The Hobbit appear, I think to stretch the films length and because they were popular in the Trilogy. I was very disappointed in this film. I'm not certain I'll even bother with the next 2, but I probably will since I'm a huge Tolkien fan. But I won't spend any of my money to see it in a theater. I'll wait for the DVDs to come out.",4,2,3,27 February 2014
Zulu," Excellent, but.......
","I really like this film. It is destined to be one of the greats, I think. Overall, the acting is quite good (save one), the story well-written and the cinematography is well done. My major complaint about the film is one of directorship. There are several scenes where the camera focuses on individuals fighting at close quarters. Very often, a British soldier is seen to 'bayonet' a Zulu warrior, only the camera very, very visibly shows that there was no contact between the bayonet and the Zulu. What I'm saying is, if you can't be realistic about something like that, perhaps they should have just cut away at the last instant and shown only a grimace on the face of the warrior as he is being 'stabbed'. My other major complaint is regarding the acting of Jack Hawkins as Rev. Witt. His acting is pretty bad in this one, which is surprising, since he's usually quite good (witness 'The Cruel Sea'). Enough about the acting. The story is a true one - 2,000 Zulu warriors attacked a puny force (slightly over 100) British soldiers from a Welsh regiment. The soldier earned 11 Victoria's Crosses during the battle. At the end of the battle, the Zulus saluted the British soldiers and then left the field. Overall, a pretty good flick. I only wish that Jack Hawkins had been up to par on this one.",8,0,2,11 May 2004
Seabiscuit," Wow
","This film came highly recommended to me and it didn't disappoint. At the very beginning of the film, there is nothing about horses and I began to wonder when the horses would come into play. Eventually, of course, they did. And once they did, this film becomes positively engrossing! Cast, acted and shot perfectly, this film tells the old story of the underdog in triumph at the same time that the nation was on its knees. The great depression figures prominently and is certainly a character in this film in and of itself. This is a story not of just a horse, but of the people who own, love and race this horse, from the owners to the stable hands, the trainer and the jockeys. But it's also the story of how this (unlikely) little horse and it's (unlikely) huge jockey brought hope to the US citizens in their time of great need. Jeff Bridges as Seabiscuit's owner and Tobey Maguire as the main jockey both shine in this film. But I believe the best performance was turned in by Chris Cooper as the eccentric trainer Tom Smith. Cooper is doing his best work to date recently and he really does a great job in this film.",8,0,0,12 January 2004
1941," Absolutely LOVED it!
","This is a classic funny film. John Belushi, Dan Akroyd, Slim Pickens and Toshiro Mifune (YES! in a comedy!) are great in this spoof of most WWII movies. Look for a young John Candy as well. This is a funny look at the invasion jitters that set in on the US west coast right after the Pearl Harbor raid. A Japanese submarine cruising up and down the coast causes all sorts of hilarious panic. This is one NOT to be missed! I LOVE IT!",8,3,8,30 January 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Double WOW!
","The only caveat I have about this film is: DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT SEEING THIS ONE UNTIL YOU'VE SEEN THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING. There is absolutely no 'things that occurred up to now' in this film. It simply takes off where the first one left off. So unless you've seen the first, you'd be lost in this film. I think that was a mistake. There are approximately 38 people on the face of the earth who didn't see the first film and they wouldn't have a clue as to what it's all about. There's no explanation as to why the Hobbits left the Shire, why they're going to Mordor or what power the ring has. However, as one who has seen the first (many times) and read the books (many times), I can say this film was MAGNIFICENTLY done. Jackson has another great film to his credit, although this one had to have been very difficult to design, plan and film. Much of this is due to the way the books were written. The film would require significant adaption and revision. It simply couldn't be filmed as it was written. See the first one, then see this one!",9,0,0,30 December 2002
Schindler's List," Superlative
",This is a superb true story starring a superb actor in a wonderful production. This film certainly deserves all the accolades it's received and probably then some. Liam Neeson is perfectly cast in this story of a German industrialist who risked everything to save at least a few Jews from the death camps. Outstanding in every way! This is a future classic film and one to buy and keep!,9,9,13,12 February 2004
The Elephant Man," Magnificent film
","This is a more or less true story, from what I understand. It is the sad story of a man named John Merrick who was horribly deformed by a disease. He spent a large part of his life as a circus or sideshow freak attraction. Shunned by nearly everybody, he was beaten and mistreated in nearly every imaginable way. Merrick is masterfully played by John Hurt. He is eventually discovered and rescued from that awful existence by a physician named Dr. Frederick Treves, played beautifully by Anthony Hopkins. The film deals partly with deformity but also partly with Merrick struggling to regain some sort of identity as a man instead of just a freak. Dr. Treves is a great ally. However, even as a man who can now move among an abbreviated clique of people, Merrick discovers that his disease is still a terrible affliction. That it was produced in black and white adds to the sad ambiance of the film and helps draw powerful emotions out. IMDb users have voted this film a spot in the top 250 films of all time and it certainly belongs to be in that company. This is Director David Lynch's finest work to date. The Elephant Man is a film that has and will continue to stand the test of time.",9,2,2,12 January 2005
K-19: The Widowmaker," Sad but true
","I'll not comment on the basic plot since that's already been well covered by other commenters. This is a well-executed film based on a true story. The acting is excellent and overall the set design is OK. I say OK only because the film doesn't convey the actual living conditions aboard a submarine of that era. The space depicted in the film is far too wide to be an actual submarine. There was also none of the condensation that was so prevalent on submarines of the time. Other than that, it was a great story and was more or less true to fact, according to what I have read. They didn't try to pull any punches and the story is brutally honest. The acting is pretty darn good by nearly everyone. You expect that from the stars, Liam Neeson and Harrison Ford, but everyone else (many of whom I'd never heard of before) also does a great job. This film is definitely worth a look!",6,1,2,30 December 2002
The Longest Day," Best War film ever made
","....and, yes, that INCLUDES Saving Private Ryan. The Longest Day outshines every other war film ever made. Talk about an all-star cast! The list of stars is amazing - Eddie Albert, John Wayne, Henry Fonda, Kurt Jurgens, Fabian, Red Buttons, Richard Burton, Peter Lawford and the list goes on! This film is also proof that you don't need a lot of blood and gore to make a film great - there is little blood and no gore in this one! The film is long - nearly 3 hours, but worth every second of it. This is a more or less factual film about the D-Day landing at Normandy. It includes many of the mistakes made on both sides during that fateful day. The story is told evenly - from all angles, American, British, French and German. The Resistance is given great weight also, as they played very key roles before and during the invasion. The Germans in the film all speak German with subtitles, which is fine and doesn't take away from the film at all. The only 'I wish' that I have about this film is that I wish it had been filmed in color. But even in B&W, I gave this film a 9. Watch it!",9,2,6,23 February 2003
Moulin Rouge!," Not bad
","This is an interesting film, set in the early 20th century but using late 20th century music. Starring Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor, both prove that they can carry a tune. Neither is a great singer but both do well enough. Once the film gets started, it can hold the viewer's interest pretty well. The story has been reviewed several times over by others so I'll not go into it much here, but suffice it to say it's a musical that's mainly a love story. It has elements of comedy and tragedy but doesn't completely fit in either genre. There is an underlying theme, which is 'the show must go on' as well as the main love story. All in all, pretty good!",7,2,3,8 March 2004
Patton," Very Good
","I own few films, but this is one of them. George C. Scott is absolutely perfect in this role. In my opinion, it is the best performance of his life. The film focuses on Gen. George S. Patton during WWII in Africa and Europe. There are enough combat scenes in the film to allow it to be called a war movie, but it is actually a biography. Patton was brilliant as a General and very eccentric and complex as a man. He was glorified and vilified, reshipped and abhorred. He was a natural warrior and Scott is able to convince the audience that HE is Patton. He convinced me, anyway! There is an excellent supporting cast, led by Karl Malden as General Omar Bradley. The film takes the viewer through all of General Patton's actions in WWII and is quite long. However, the story is fascinating and does not seem long at all. It is well-written, honest, and well-executed on film. It's destined to be one of the great ones!",9,1,3,26 January 2001
Men in Black II," *Sigh* typical sequel
","When will the studios learn? Sequels almost always stink in comparison with the original film. MIB2 is, unfortunately, no exception. As soon as I saw that stupid dog, I just knew it was going to talk. It was inevitable. I had no idea it would be such a major character. Dumb. This film is not nearly as entertaining as the first one...typical sequel fare. The good guys are largely the same but the aliens are different this time, and the stakes are higher. However, the film's writing is poor and inclusion of a talking dog is totally stupid. There's a decent bit of action in this, as you'd expect from a Will Smith film. Tommy Lee Jones is back as K (once his memory has been restored) and Rip Torn's back as Zed. And all of them are decent enough in the acting department. It's the script, basic story and screenplay that leave this one wanting. Sorry, but this film's a stinker.",4,1,3,20 August 2006
Kelly's Heroes," Positive waves!
","This is a truly humorous film. A drunken German Officer reveals the existence of 16,000 gold bars to a US soldier and the word gets around that it's there for the taking. There's just one problem - the gold is behind German lines and in a bank. So what? Off our guys go to liberate this gold from the Nazis. By the middle of the film, there are a fair number of hangers-on who also want some of this gold. One of them is Oddball, played by Donald Sutherland. His is the funniest part and his character's name is well deserved. Even during some of the definitely non-funny combat scenes, he provides some comic relief. Also starring are Clint Eastwood, Telly Savalas, Don Rickles and Carroll O'Connor. This is one film to buy and keep. Pull it out a couple times a year, pop some corn and enjoy!",9,1,2,30 October 2000
Caddyshack," So silly that it's great fun!
","This film stars Bill Murray, Ted Knight and Rodney Dangerfield in a story that centers on an exclusive (read 'snooty')  private golf course. Bill Murray is perfect as Carl, the (really) psychotic groundskeeper. Ted Knight as Judge Smalls is, well, ....Ted. It's Rodney Dangerfield as Al, who steals the show. Al is the most obnoxious individual I've ever seen and I loved the character! Dangerfield excels at delivering one-liner insults to everyone in the film. One of the tragedies in the film is the role played by Chevy Chase as Ty. Ty could have been left out of the film entirely and no one would have noticed. This was a waste of talent. However, the rest of the film is great and I recommend it to anyone who thinks golf is 'stuffy'.",Null,0,1,19 February 2001
Shrek 2," very good sequel
","Sequels are usually not as good as the originals, but this one breaks that mold. It is every bit as entertaining as Shrek was. The fact that there is continuity between them, and the characters all have the same voices as in Shrek really helps. Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz and Eddie Murphy all reprise their roles as Shrek, Fiona and Donkey. The basic story is that Pricess Fiona and Shrek have gotten married and have been invited back to the Princess's parents kingdom to celebrate the marriage. Howver, the King doesn't like the fact that Fiona married and ogre and has also become one all the time herself. She was supposed to have married Prince Charming, who would have broken the ogre spell for her. There is a wicked fairy godmother to contend with as well. The animation is wonderful and nearly looks real. It's a well written story with enough going on to keep the viewer's interest. Overall, a great sequel (and I rarely say THAT!).",7,0,0,26 December 2004
2001: A Space Odyssey," Stunning film
","This truly deserves to be in the top 25 films of all time. It's ranked 56 out of 250 here and so is just a little low, I believe. Looking at the voting, as of today, 40% of people who rated this film rated it a solid 10...few films score that highly! This film was absolutely mind-boggling back in 1968 and it has stood the test of time. Stanley Kubrick has a knack for making immortal films and this is definitely one of those! The SFX were quite advanced for their day and the visuals still hold up well. The mix of music was perfect! Who'd have thought of a classic Blue Danube Waltz while docking a space craft? I truly love this film and I intend to buy and keep it!",9,0,3,2 February 2003
Invictus," Pretty good, but...
","This film is about the birth of unity within the new South Africa after the minority white government had been voted out and the nations' first black President took the oath of office. Everyone had to learn to work together, and they were having difficulty doing so. There was a predominantly white rugby team that had a dismal record, but was still followed passionately mostly by the white people in the country. The new President, Nelson Mandela, took the opportunity to get the team to play for the entire country instead of just for the white minority. Along the way, national pride swelled as the nations' black majority, who hadn't cared about rugby before, began to back the team. Look for some good acting, but, I must say that the performance I liked the least was Morgan Freemans as Nelson Mandela. They had him affecting a sort of accent and I believe it hurt his performance. He is usually by far the best actor in any film. But other than the fake accent, this is a very good film, directed well by Clint Eastwood.",8,0,0,13 September 2010
The Last Samurai," Quite good but purloined, methinks
","Does anybody else think this may be a rewrite of the old SHOGUN? The book, SHOGUN, is superb, but I didn't care much for the film. Obviously, the plot is somewhat different, but the basic story line is the same. We have a Westerner teaching the Japanese, who before used only the bow and the sword, to use guns in war. Westerner learns to love the ancient Japanese culture, turning his back on his awful western ways. Sound familiar? This is much better written than SHOGUN (the film) and in my opinion, has superior acting (but then even I can act better than Richard Chamberlain). Cruise is excellent, but Ken Watanabe as the warlord Katsumoto steals the show from Tom. A beautiful Japanese actress Koyuki also does an excellent acting job. A lot of the dialog is in Japanese with English subtitles, but somehow that's not too much of a distraction; it adds to the realism. There are a couple of large battle scenes and, yes, it gets very bloody. But when you hack someone's arm off, they're going to bleed! Overall, very well done but some borrowed or recycled material.",7,0,1,25 May 2004
National Treasure," Fairly entertaining
","I am NOT, repeat, NOT, a Nicolas Cage fan, mainly because he relies too much on action to carry his films (instead of his acting), but this is a pretty decent flick. There is enough action and suspense to keep the viewer's interest and also to maintain the pace of the film. There's actually not very much actual violence (strange for a Cage film!), but the story is so well-written that even Cage can pull it off without any gore. The basic story has been reviewed several times, but it's the continuation of a 200 year old treasure hunt. Cage must solve riddle after riddle to find the ultimate clue to the treasure's whereabouts. The clue is finally determined to be on the back of the Declaration of Independence. How Cage figures the clue that leads him there is pretty far-fetched but its the key to the story. If you buy into that, the rest of the riddles are acceptable. There's also a double cross plot headed by the great Sean Bean that provides a lot of the action. The lovely Diane Kruger portrays the poor lady who gets caught up in the middle of all this intrigue. Overall, except for the figuring out of the clue found in the ship (the viewer just has to assume that he's that far above the rest of us in intelligence), a pretty exciting film with a little something for everyone.",7,95,130,30 November 2004
The Da Vinci Code," Excellently done
","Ron Howard's adaptation of Dan Brown's The DaVinci Code is as good as an adaptation of a very popular book can be. Anyone who knows anything about film making knows that no film can achieve the depth of a book. There simply isn't time to establish all the little character nuances and idiosyncrasies that a book can. The job of the film maker is to keep the basic story as intact as possible, add as little as possible that's not in the book, and still make an entertaining, coherent film. Trust me, it ain't as easy as it sounds. I've read this book enough to know that the film makers left out some stuff. But, examination of what they left out reveals that it wasn't really necessary at all. So the screenplay, direction and scripting left adequate information for the viewer to know exactly what they need to know to follow and enjoy the film. The acting throughout the film was excellent. Tom Hanks is super as Professor Langdon. I'd not heard of the French actress Audry Tautou before, but she was great as his collaborator. This is a truly international cast, purposely cast as such since the film takes place in various parts of the world. Sir Ian McKellan portrays the expert Teabing. Paul Bettany is excellent as 'the ghost' Silas. Altogether, this is a fascinating film. I'm not going into the plot, since it has more twists than a drunken snake. Enjoy it!",8,3,4,16 November 2006
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Greatly entertaining!
","This is a great yarn put together very nicely on film. I think this and the second film are both excellent entertainment. They are wonderful family films although not for very small children. Any child over 8 shouldn't have any problem with these films. The acting is first rate, even by the children. Special effects are, for the most part, very well done. Somehow Fluffy just didn't seem quite real, but that didn't bother me at all. The flying scenes are wonderful. I'm waiting for the 3rd film to come out soon! Good stuff!",8,0,0,18 January 2004
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Decent condensation
",".....and, short of making a 6-hour film, a condensation is what this film is. The script must have been absolutely rotten to write. What to leave in? What to leave out? JK Rowling's books are so full of totally imaginative magical things and creatures. But they left in enough magical moments to make the film work. The film is executed beautifully. Some of the art department's work, particularly the Yule Ball set, is stunning. Wardrobe also did a fantastic job on all the finery for the ball. The young main characters, now seasoned actors, are coming along in their acting abilities. The adult actors, as usual, are terrific. Alan Rickman as Professor Snape scares me every time I see him! The direction is first-rate. Overall, a very enjoyable film. I'm not going to complain about what was left out. When you try to make a 2-1/2 hour film from a 700 page book, some things just gotta go. I did want to see what a blast-ended skrewt looked like, though! Very little of real import was left out of the film vs the book. I believe that anyone who follows just the films should be able to keep up. Left in, and so importantly so, is the young wizards growing up. Their relationships are now taking on more adult-like characteristics. They are (in some cases, rather reluctantly) discovering the opposite sex. They're moodier than before. They're, well, they're Teenagers! I did think that the special effects in this film left me feeling that they should have been much better, and that's my major complaint about the film. The mood of this film, while having a lot of lighter moments, turns very, very dark toward the end. Death is now reality for the students of Hogwarts. Readers of the books can just fill in the blanks and embellish the film with all the little goodies that there just wasn't time for. I'm looking forward to the Order of the Phoenix! I just wish they wouldn't make us all wait so damned long between films!",7,0,0,8 March 2006
The Untouchables," A Pretty fair flick
","Kevin Costner as Eliot Ness didn't shine in this film, but Sean Connery did. His depiction of Malone, a tough Irish cop, is right on the money. This is the story of Eliot Ness and his small band of men against Alphonse Capone and his empire. The film depicts the 'Feds' in some of their raids on Capone's empire. Some of them weren't successful and Ness and crew were the subjects of much ridicule in the press. This is no spoiler, but eventually they got Capone on a tax evasion charge. There is plenty of violence if you like that sort of thing. The film is told almost totally from the law's side, but, in the end, that was the only side that mattered. Robert De Niro shows how great an actor he is and is downright scary as Capone! Charles Martin Smith and Andy Garcia also star. I don't know how factual this film is, but I truly enjoyed it.",8,0,1,1 November 2000
The Godfather: Part III," Falls short of the other two
","This film, however, would have been considered a very good film were it not for it's two older siblings, both of which were fantastic! This film MUST be judged against the other two (duh!) and it falls short. Not too far, but still short. This film just lacks the power that the other two films exude. This film just doesn't 'grab' the viewer like the other two did. Francis Ford Coppola did a great job, as did the cast, but they couldn't make a story that is just a little bit weaker than the other Godfather stories into a great film. Thankfully, this was the last of the Godfather trilogy. Al Pacino returns as Michael Corleone, Talia Shire as Connie and Diane Keaton as Kay. Robert Duvall bailed out. Sofia Coppola (yes, his daughter!) is in this as Michael's daughter. She's a much better director than she is an actress. So the acting suffers just a little in this one also. Pacino's performance was OK but not up to his usual standards. Diane Keaton gets a deeper part in this than any of the other films. Andy Garcia joins the cast in this one and steals the show, in my opinion. As I said, standing on it's own, it would have been judged a better film. This film suffers from the company it keeps. I own it and will always own it. But I'll probably watch this one a bit less than the other two.",8,1,2,2 February 2003
A Beautiful Mind," Good film, lousy title
","Ron Howard has another great film notch in his gun. This film is one that I put off seeing (mainly because of it's lousy title). It's just not a title that grabs you. I can't think of a better one, but this title stinks. Anyway, the film doesn't stink. It's the true story about John Nash, a mathematician who is brilliant and also quite schizophrenic. He saw secret codes everywhere, including many that weren't there. I haven't read much about Nash, so am not certain how factual this is. This is Russell Crowe's best work yet. It's difficult to play an insane person, but he pulls off playing John Nash very nicely. Jennifer Connelly does excellent work as Nash's (beautiful) wife, and who sticks with him through the madness and a few other trials. In support, Christopher Plummer, Ed Harris and Paul Bettany round out a great cast. This is one not to be missed.",8,0,2,30 November 2002
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Not bad
","This is a pretty well-made fantasy film. I'm surprised at the quality of the acting, considering that over half the cast are children. But everyone did a pretty good job and the story is excellent. I usually don't care for films such as this but this one is good.",7,0,1,3 August 2003
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Not bad, not bad
","Mr. and Mrs. Smith was one of those films that, just looking at the teasers on TV, made me think 'I'll wait for the video'. I was right. While it's a completely enjoyable flick, I'm glad I didn't pay to go see it. It's good, but not worth a ridiculously-priced theater ticket. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie star as two hit people who meet, fall in love and get married without any knowledge of what the other REALLY does for a living. There are some circumstances that lead up to an inevitable showdown between the two and the result is dramatic humor of the first-rate kind. Parts of the film are hilarious, others sad, most are dramatic. The film's script manages to blend all these elements together pretty well. The two major stars work well together and the result is something decent to watch. This film is well worth a rental fee and I'd recommend it to anyone old enough to watch it.",7,0,1,3 January 2006
War of the Worlds," Decent but no more
","This film, a remake of a Hollywood classic, could have been so much better. The film has all the right ingredients, save one. It has the actors and actresses...Tom Cruise, Dakota Fanning, and the Director, Spielberg. What it lacks is a decent script. And much of the script is good (not great, but good). But the ending of the film is a complete failure. The action and suspense very abruptly end. There's no indication previous to the very end that the invaders are being affected by Earth's germs and viruses until, all of a sudden, they're falling over. One would think that, as sickness began to take the invaders, that their behavior might become a bit erratic, but there's no sign of that. Also, all of a sudden, Cruise and Fanning find themselves on a street full of nice, neat, untouched little brownstone houses. There's no indication that the city around them is completely devastated. There are no survivors clamoring to get under the shelter in one or more of these surviving homes. And the son surviving the fireball on the other side of the hill is implausible. Then, of course, we must have the requisite and sickening reconciliation between father and son. ACK! 6 out of 10 only for the first 3/4 of the film. The last quarter is a 1 out of 10; it simply becomes too laughable to take seriously. A wasted opportunity to remake an old favorite.",6,0,1,16 January 2006
All Quiet on the Western Front," Superb!
","This film is everything that most of the reviewers have said...and then some. I believe it to be among the greatest war films ever made. Don't be fooled, this is not a war movie, but an anti-war movie. It's about the destruction of both life and innocence, the magnificence and futility of war. In the next war, Gen. George S. Patton, US Army was quoted as saying, 'Compared to war, all other forms of human endeavor pale to insignificance'. And he was right - man pours more time, effort and money into war than any other pursuit. When the soldiers on both sides of World War I marched off to war, some even called it 'a lovely little war'. When it stalled into a stalemate that resulted in the slaughter of millions of people, it was no longer lovely. This film follows some German soldiers through from enlistment till the end. There is a great deal of emotion in this film and it comes through to the viewer. There was a fine remake of this film starring Richard Thomas and Ernest Borgnine, but it pales next to this one. This is truly one of the epic best films of all time. Watch this one, then the remake. Both are good.",9,2,4,26 February 2004
Ice Age," Cute film
","I watched this film with a bit of trepidation, since I don't normally care for films of this genre. However, I found myself mildly surprised at the quality of this one. While the animation isn't terribly great, the story pulls the film along nicely. It's paced properly, with no wasted time. There is little need for violence, so there's very little of it. Drama and humor are the major elements in the film. Much of the humor is provided almost as a sidebar by a prehistoric saber-toothed squirrel named Scrat. He has the worst time keeping up with an acorn that he's trying to store away. The dramatic element is provided by an unlikely trio trying to return a lost human infant to it's 'herd'. The trio, a woolly mammoth, a sloth and a saber-toothed tiger, face several trials and some outside interference to try to accomplish their task. This was a pretty enjoyable flick and I'd recommend it to everybody, especially children.",7,0,2,3 January 2006
Man on Fire," Pretty decent Denzel flick
","(But then, aren't pretty much ALL his flicks pretty decent?). Anyway, this is your basic action film, and it has a goodly bit of it. I thought the beginning was a bit too long. I realize the importance of creating a bond between the the bodyguard (Denzel Washington) and the subject being guarded (Dakota Fanning). However, I thought they took just a few minutes too long to establish that relationship. I don't know how they could have cut it down and still made it work, but basically, I believe the film starts a bit too slowly. The plot has been hashed over several times, so there are no spoilers here. Once the kidnap plot against the girl (Fanning) actually occurs, the action picks up nicely. There is gratuitous violence, torture, death and, of course, lots of shooting. The film doesn't drag once the action starts, and can definitely keep the viewer interested. I enjoyed the film overall, especially after getting through the slower and overlong beginning. Denzel puts in his usual excellent performance. Look for good work also from Rutger Hauer and Dakota Fanning. Overall worth a watch but very violent. Not for the kiddies.",8,0,2,19 October 2004
The Green Mile," A masterpiece
","This film, adapted from a book by Stephen King, is full of surprises. One thing which is NOT a surprise is the acting from this entire cast. They are all superb! Tom Hanks leads this outstanding cast, but no one really outdoes the others...they are simply all great. The film is set in 1935, at a prison in Louisiana, and focuses on Death Row, called the Green Mile. There are a couple of pretty gruesome scenes of executions, including one badly botched one. There is enough character development for the viewer to establish a relationship with all of the characters. Some of these characters are odious, to say the least. A couple are truly lovable. One character, that of John Coffey, played by Michael Clarke Duncan, is an amazing person. I'll not spoil the film for you, but I will say this particular character is the most lovable of all. You need to see this film at least one time! I think that once you've seen it, you will want to see it again. It is magical!",8,0,1,20 February 2001
Jaws," A terrifyingly real film
","This film kept thousands of people out of the ocean for several years. (And then it's sequel came out!) This is a cinematic triumph - what else do you expect from Steven Spielberg? This film sparked more shark-mania than any other shark story in history (before or since). Peter Benchley has actually expressed regret at having written this (and it's commercial success) since it sparked shark genocide on a huge scale. This film is so well-made that it had that sort of impact. The cast is excellent, the story first-rate and Spielberg's execution of the story is unmatched!",8,1,3,30 January 2003
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," lost my interest
","Lucas's grand finale was a grand fizzle. The story to end all the others stories just fell flat. The script was good, and the acting absolutely first-rate. I could tell that they took great pains to make certain that there was continuity between this film and Episode IV. Near the end, when Darth Vader's helmet is placed on his head and he draws that first very audible breath, was a 'goose bump' scene. There simply weren't very many of them in the film. There is one major continuity issue that I noticed. In Episode IV, Princess Leia talks about her mother as if she knew her as a child, and mentions her being sad. But in this film, Padme (Leia's mother) dies immediately after giving birth, so Leia couldn't have known her mother. That didn't bother me too much, though. What DID fall flat were the special effects. Nothing in this film can compare with the work of Weta Digital in the LOtR trilogy. I'm afraid that ILM just hasn't quite caught up with the Kiwis. Lucasfilms relies on technology that's been superseded. The entire lava planet fight scene, which is the 'kick butt' sequence, looks so faked that I couldn't get into it. That's where the film lost me...and it never regained my interest. Sorry, George. I gave it only a 6 and I think that's being generous.",6,3,6,5 November 2005
Shooter," May contain spoilers
","Mark Wahlberg stars in yet another action flick.Ho hum, you say. But fasten your seat belts and hang on. This film will keep the viewer guessing what's coming next. There are plot twists and turn enough to satisfy anyone. There is a bit of romance with a very awesome lady (naturally!) And, if you want pyrotechnics, they're in this film in abundance. The action is nearly constant, and I was never tempted to watch something else. Once you start this film, you're in it until the end. I didn't see any plot holes, so I believe the script and screenplay were well-written. Acting and direction were great. Special effects (the aforementioned pyrotechnics, especially) were well-done as well. All in all, it's a sort of mindless entertainment action film, but this one stands above most, I think.",8,1,1,14 July 2013
Lord of War," Fair, and barely that
","This is the kind of film that makes me not think much of Nicolas Cage. The film has such promise, but in the end it just comes up very short. The basic story is fine (and, at the end, the credits state that it's based on true events). It's Nicolas's acting that gets in the way. He just isn't cut out for this type of part. In this film, he sells guns, but doesn't use them. And that's all wrong for Nick. The rest of the cast is pretty decent so it's Cage that's holding it back. Cage becomes very successful at selling arms and staying just one tiny (sometimes comically so) step ahead of the Feds. Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms are very interested in his dealings. The film actually tries to show that most of these weapons end up in the hands of villagers or warlords who then slaughter villagers. It shows that the arms dealer, who sees some of the violence wrought by his wares, is able to distance himself from it. The one decent thing that this film has going for it is that fact that, at the end of the film, Yuri still hasn't seen the error of his ways and is still in business. Had this film starred someone other than Nicolas, I probably would have liked it much better. I gave it a 6.",6,0,2,23 January 2006
The Terminal," A bit underrated
","Tom Hanks sure has a knack for picking the right scripts. Or perhaps Hanks makes the film. I'm not sure, but this is another Hanks success. This is the story of a foreigner who, while in mid-flight to the US, becomes a man without a country when his country falls in a revolution. He therefore does not now have a valid visa to enter the US, nor can he go home since he never actually entered the US. He is forced to live in the airport terminal. The film really doesn't give the viewer a sense of how long he's been there until, at one point, someone mentions 9 months! Hanks is befriended by nearly all of the airport workers and manages to survive very nicely through ingenuity after an awkward start. He falls in love with a flight attendant, the gorgeous Catherine Zeta-Jones. Look for very good acting from the entire cast and a well-written story and screenplay. The only weakness I saw in the film was that his character, who arrives speaking very little English, seems to learn it fairly quickly. Then we find out how long he's been there, so it's not that hard to believe after all. All in all, an enjoyable film and well worth a watch.",8,1,2,21 February 2005
The Shawshank Redemption," WHOA! Whatta film!
","I don't know why it took me so long to see this film but I finally did. I've seen a lotta films in my day, but I think this is definitely one of the top 10. Indeed, it's rated by the viewers as the #2 film of all-time on this database, just behind The Godfather. This film is a powerful story of hope and despair, love and hate, institutionalization and corruption. There's not much violence in it, although there is strong (homo)sexual content. This story takes place almost entirely in a maximum-security prison. The story would be powerful even with no 'brand-name' actors in it, but Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins both do a magnificent job in this film. This is a film that should not be missed!",10,0,1,19 February 2003
Back to the Future Part II," Not up with the first film
","This is the second film in the series and it, like most sequels, lags behind the first film. I think most sequels just lack the originality that was present in the first film. This film definitely has its moments and is, overall, quite entertaining. It just isn't quite as good as the first. For the most part, the important characters are all back. Michael J. Fox obviously enjoyed doing these films (he made 3 of them!) and he is the best actor in the series, this one included. This is NOT a waste of time - it's just not quite up there with the first.",6,1,3,16 April 2003

Vanilla Sky," Huh?
","I have to admit that I just don't understand this film. I'm an intelligent person, but it just didn't make much sense to me. Yes, everything was explained at the end, but I found this film too disjointed. I'm sure that it was meant to be that way, but it was too much so for me. I was lost for a good part of the film and only the beauty of Cameron Diaz and Penelope Cruz kept me interested. I wasn't terribly impressed with Tom Cruise in this one and he's usually very good. Kurt Russell did the best acting job in the film as the psychologist. Maybe I'm just getting dumb in my old age, but this one just didn't do it for me.",5,0,1,10 October 2002
Tombstone," I like this film
","I like it, but more than it actually deserves. The acting by the entire cast is very good. Kurt Russell plays Wyatt very well. Dana Delaney is stunningly beautiful and Val Kilmer's performance as the seriously ill Doc Holliday is brilliant. But the best performance is by Michael Biehn as Johnny Ringo. He was convincing and made me undeerstand that Johnny Ringo was totally evil. The character of Curly Bill Brocious was poorly written in that he chuckled too much to be taken seriously. I believe the film begins to go downhill a bit at the end. The part where US Marshall Earp, Doc and his Deputies finally mop up the Cowboys is just a little too neat, too choreographed. There was a bit too much showmanship there. The final cleanup of the cowboys was actually a difficult, bloody process. The cowboys didn't give up since they knew they'd be hanged if they did. Consequently, most of them had to be hunted down individually. So for that lapse in the ending, I dropped it to a 7. The rest of the film is absolutely excellent, however!",8,0,0,30 October 2000
Blade Runner," Weird. Good, but weird
","This is a pretty freaky flick. Harrison Ford sure stepped out of his box to make this one! The film centers on Ford, who is a sort of a terminator for human clones who've gone astray. Cloning is common but it is very difficult to tell a clone from a real human. Only a special eye scan test taken under questioning can tell. It takes place only about 20 years in the future, so the special effects are minimal. This isn't a typical high budget Ford film. It's totally different from anything else you've ever seen him do. Director Ridley Scott did a good job, but it's pretty much out of his usual genre also. The film also stars the gorgeous Sean Young and Darryl Hannah. Also giving a good performance is the always good Rutger Hauer. It's weird. Just plain weird. Good, but definitely in the twilight zone.",7,1,2,2 February 2004
Ben-Hur," Epic in the true sense of the word
","I had to rate this film a 9 (extremely high from me!). This despite the fact the I consider the films biggest star a poor actor. Charlton Heston (the aforementioned poor actor) stars as Judah Ben Hur, a wealthy and powerful Jewish prince and merchant in first century (AD) Rome. When his old boyhood friend comes to power as governor, the two find that they are more or less polar opposites now. Eventually, Ben Hur is enslaved and his entire family thrown in prison. Ben Hur manages to battle his way back and eventually becomes a star in the arena. The climactic scene in the film is the big chariot race. I recall a persistent rumor that circulated for years after this film's release that someone had died during the filming of the legendary chariot race, but no one did. In fact, there were no serious injuries either. This film was the first to win 11 Academy Awards, though not the last. It certainly deserved each one of them. This film is a true classic and has stood the test of time. Excellent!",9,0,2,28 January 2005

The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Another triumph for Jackson
","I finally saw this film and it's spectacular, but perhaps just a tiny bit less so than 'The Two Towers', which is my favorite of the trilogy. This film is still fantastic. Much has been made of the leaving out of Christopher Lee, but the truth is, his part was unnecessary to the Return of the King. I would have liked to have seen him again but I'm sure he'll be in the DVD version (yes, he is). I also missed seeing the scouring of the Shire. However, overall this is a great film and one that I believe should certainly garner Best Picture honors! The cast and crew, special effects, costume, makeup, Howard Shore's score, and everything else that makes up this film are all first-rate. I believe these folks have done some career-best work in many cases. Jackson will certainly be hard-pressed to top this trilogy. I hope that many of these actors don't end up typecast. It would be a pity to see some of these folks not be able to find good roles because of their superb work in these films.",9,0,0,13 January 2004
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," the one that started them all
","Fantastic for it's day. The SFX were spectacular and the acting superb. The fact that Lucas was able to snare some big names (such as Alec Guiness, Harrison Ford (a rising star) and Carrie Fisher) attests to his salesmanship of the script. His execution of the script is flawless and the result is a triumph. Its success has led to further films in the series and I can't wait for the next one.",8,1,1,27 November 2002
Hart's War," Tries too hard
","First off, let me say I didn't hate this film, but neither can I give it high marks. It quite simply fails, mostly. It tries to be a war movie, but it isn't really about war. It tries to be a POW movie, but it fails (miserably). It tries to be a movie about racism and there it only partially succeeds, because the setting is just so wrong. The setting is a German Stalag (POW camp). There are Allied prisoners there, both Russian and American. The film is mostly set on the American side of the camp. The German guards are remarkably nice to the American prisoners, which is very unrealistic. Life in the camp is good for the most part and all the Americans look very well-fed (also unrealistic). Then two American fighter pilots, both black, are brought into the camp and the racism part begins. No one wants them in their barracks, which is realistic. One of them is set up by the other prisoners and is summarily executed. The other is then accused of murdering another prisoner. The prisoners are then allowed to hold an American Court-martial! LUDICROUS! No German commander would allow something like this to happen in their camp. He even helps the defending attorney (who had been a Yale law student pre-war). Turns out, the Kommandant is a Yale graduate - how convenient! In short, the entire plot is so full of holes that you could drain spaghetti with it. However, there are a couple of bright spots...look for good performances from Colin Farrell as Hart and Marcel Iures as the Kommandant. I wouldn't spend too much money to watch this film, but it might fill in a couple hours if you're bored.",5,1,2,16 July 2002
300," Overly hyped
","This film, initially, wasn't touted as much...then it won a couple of awards and all of a sudden, it was the 'sleeper of the year'. I thought it was decent, but overly hyped. The film was, apparently, an blend of live action with a computer-generated background. It's the background, I believe that really left me cold. There's plenty of violence, blood and death, even a little sex and toplessness. The major problem is that the background (excepting the precious few indoor shots, which, I guess were shot in a studio) doesn't look real at all. I'm talking completely UNREAL looking. I didn't realize how important a realistic looking background is until this film. The vast majority of the story takes place outdoors and it hurt what could have been a very good film. The actors are, for the most part, relative unknowns, yet they all did a very good job. I had hoped for something a bit better.",6,4,5,31 August 2007
Apollo 13," A truly great film
","This Ron Howard film is his best yet and that's saying a lot. Howard seems to always be in the right place at the right time and his directorship of this film is no exception. The acting is excellent by the stars and all the supporting cast. The stars are such that one can only expect great things from them. There's Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton and Kevin Bacon. There's also Gary Sinise, Ed Harris and Kathleen Quinlan. This, folks, is an all-star cast and the acting definitely reflects that. A good touch was letting us get to know the Lovell family, which added to the drama and poignancy of the story. The story is true and I believe that I heard that there is very little artistic license taken in this film...it was made to be realistic. Howard has another masterpiece on his hands! This is a film to acquire for your film library!",8,0,0,28 November 2002
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," just barely below the first one
","Another Lucas masterpiece. This film is just a little bit weaker than the first, or perhaps the impact of some of the SFX was lessened by the fact that they were pretty much the same as the Episode IV. While they were novel in the first film, they were expected in this film. Still, a great film. This entire series is destined to become 'Classic', et al. I think that people went into this film with high expectations and were not disappointed. I wasn't, not really - it's a great film. Still, as I said, just a LITTLE bit less great than the first one.",7,2,4,27 November 2002
Aladdin," Hilarious
","I think this is one of the funniest films that Disney has ever done. This is due entirely to Robin William's brilliant voice of the Genie. He is wonderful in this role. I think the animation is pretty fair although I dislike the 'generic' people that Disney's shop is putting out these days. They all share the same basic facial structure and eyes, so there is not much difference between any of the characters. It's not like Sleepy, Doc and Sneezy, who all looked very different. Still, this is a great and funny film. It is totally clean and not very violent so it is appropriate for every member of the family. Give this one a try and you'll have a great time watching it!",7,65,86,7 February 2001
Gangs of New York," Pretty fair but misses being great
","This is a drawn-out story of the battle of the Irish to be accepted in NY. I mentioned drawn-out because that's its main flaw - it's too long. The story could be shortened and the film would gain by losing some footage. The acting is pretty decent throughout, though nobody is particularly outstanding in this one. The strongest performance is by Daniel Day-Lewis as Bill the Butcher, and he outshines both Pitt and Diaz. Overall, I'm not sorry I watched it, but I'm really glad I didn't pay more than a rental fee to see it.",6,0,1,26 July 2003
Windtalkers," Ridiculous
","I thought this was a film about Navajo code talkers. Well, it's not.  While there are a couple of Navajos in the film, the story revolves  around Nicolas Cage winning WWII all by himself. This guy's incredible  and makes John Wayne look like a wimp. Every time the Marines are in  trouble, up jumps good old Nicolas Cage with his Thompson and POOF! the  battle is WON! I wonder how we won WWII without Nicolas Cage? The film  has a LOT of combat footage and most of that is very well done. That  alone is worth a watch but don't expect to learn much of anything about  the Navajo code talkers. You should read about them, because theirs was  an important part of history, but they're a minor part in this film. I  gave it a 6, only because of the good combat footage.",6,182,243,26 October 2002
Braveheart," An epic film
","I have heard some complain about how bloody this film is. Well, folks, this is a war movie, plain and simple and war is bloody. The Gulf War was bloody....you just didn't see it. This film is very real as it depicts how horrible war is. William Wallace was a warrior and warriors make people bleed. Enough about that. The film is magnificent. The facts are somewhat stretched and some artistic license is taken, but the film is a more or less accurate description of life in Scotland at that time. Wallace is the national hero of Scotland to this day and his fight to free the Scots from the English yoke is the stuff of legend. This film attempts to capture the essence of that legend. Never mind that there are some inaccuracies...the film is a work of art. Mel Gibson as Wallace (and director) really shines in this work. Wallace is shown to be a man, one who tried to live quietly and peacefully. However, it was not to be and he and his men ended up fighting the entire English army (and the Scottish Nobles). The battle scenes are indeed bloody (if perhaps a bit too long) and realistic. The story also revolves around the ascention of Robert the Bruce, who eventually became King of Scotland. This is a long and ambitious work and Gibson the actor and director made it work beautifully. The cinematography is truly great, the scenery magnificent and the story undeniably a classic. If you don't own this film, buy it now!",Null,1,2,19 February 2001
The Breakfast Club," Funny-sad
","This must be one of the best 'teen' films ever made. I resisted watching it for a while because 'it looked boring'. It's not boring! This work explores the depths of feeling of 5 teenagers in a way that is totally realistic. The dialog and interaction between the characters is perfectly done, exactly as teens would have done it. There are 5 totally distinct personalities and they begin to understand one another as they talk out pretty much anything and everything. Some of the dialog is serious, some inane. Don't try to think of it as a comedy, because it isn't. There are some moments of levity, but this is a serious film! Watch this in one sitting and you will enjoy it better.",Null,0,1,22 February 2001
Gladiator," A really great film
","Russell Crowe's best work (until A Beautiful Mind). Crowe stars as a brilliant Roman General who is double-crossed by a treacherous prince. Crowe becomes a Gladiator for reasons not fully explained (to my satisfaction at least) and manages to become the greatest Gladiator over a period of time (well, DUH!...it wouldn't be much of a film if he got killed early on, now would it?). The film is very well filmed and Crowe is excellent in this one. This is a don't-miss!",9,0,1,6 February 2003
The Wedding Singer," Cute film
","Chick flicks are not my thing (but then, I'm not a chick). This one's OK for a chick flick. The acting seems pretty natural from everyone involved and it has a few twists in the plot to keep things moving. The story has already been reviewed so I'll not bother with it here but I enjoyed this film!",6,0,1,4 December 2003
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Not bad, not bad
","This film is MUCH MUCH better than Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom but not as good as Raiders of the Lost Ark. Guess that puts it right in the middle. This one is superbly acted but the thing that hurts this film a little is the unbelievablilty of the story. Still, it sports the 'Raiders-esque' action, drama and suspense. It's overall a very good film. Harrison Ford and Sean Connery are both great in this. Will there be another Indy film? I surely hope so!",6,1,3,3 December 2002
Back to the Future," Very funny film
","This is a classic! Michael J. Fox travels back in time and, by accident, the then teenage girl who will become his Mom falls for him. This can't happen, since it would prevent his parents from falling in love and that means he'll never be born. There are many humorous twists in the plot. Towards the end, Fox stands in with the band at a school dance and shows that he can play a guitar! His music turns out to be a little too 80's for the crowd but he's GOOD! I like this movie!",6,3,16,16 April 2003
Shark Tale," Only fair
","I found myself disappointed with this film. The animation is terrific and the story itself should be very good. However, the voice work just left something to be desired. Considering the big names behind the voices, I expected something better. They did OK, but this cast should have done much, much better. Will Smith, Robert DeNiro, Renee Zellweger, Angelina Jolie, Katie Couric, Peter Falk, what a list! And they all just left me with a bland feeling. I didn't really feel much of anything one way or the other about any of them. They didn't make me love them or hate them. I just felt indifferent about all the characters. And, excuse me, a vegetarian shark? Where have we seen that one before? Does Finding Nemo sound familiar ('Fish are friends, not food')? I watched this film with great anticipation and was really let down. I gave it a 6 for the strength of the animation and the story itself, but the voice work just left me cold.",6,1,5,21 February 2005
Jurassic Park," not sure what the fuss was about
","Possible spoilers for the one or two people in the world who haven't seen this one yet. OK - it's OK. But I'm not sure why the sequels. It's not THAT good. I heard all sorts of ranting and raving about this film at one time. It took me several years to see it and maybe I just expected too much. It certainly isn't bad, but neither is it great. The special effects are OK but nothing to get excited about. Especially the dinosaurs...and that's bad because this is a film about dinosaurs. If the dinos aren't real, the film won't seem real. They just don't look that real. They somehow look and act mechanical. I thought the acting was pretty good throughout, but certainly nothing to write home about. Overall, I was very disappointed with what I saw vs what I was expecting. I just don't see what all the fuss was about.",6,3,9,2 February 2004
Beetlejuice," Great film!
","This is a great film! Michael Keaton, Alec Baldwin and (cute!) Geena Davis are wonderful in this film. It's Baldwin's best work (I think he's a below-average actor anyway). I'm not a huge dark comedy fan, but I really like this one. From what I understand, it wasn't originally planned to be a comedy at all, but Keaton inspired comedy and it really worked! The film moves along very nicely, with no dead spots in it at all. This is not one for the young, but anybody over 12 or so should be able to handle the SFX, some of which are scary or gross. Overall, a very good dark comedy - I LIKE IT!",8,1,2,20 December 2002
Valkyrie," Main character miscast
","Yes. Tom Cruise was miscast in this film. The story of the Valkyrie plot against Hitler has been told many times and there's pretty much no derivation from the actual events in this film. The problem arises with the casting of Tom Cruise. He simply did not or could not carry the powerful character of Claus Von Stauffenberg and the entire film suffered from it. Everyone else in the film did a creditable job and thus the film doesn't actually venture into the 'bad' category, but it's close. I was expecting a powerful performance from Cruise but it just isn't there in this case. Heck, Cruise even bears a slight resemblance to Von Stauffenberg. Overall, I was quite disappointed in what should have been a good film. Perhaps others will see it differently, but I'd skip it if reruns of nearly anything else were on TV.",6,0,1,24 August 2012
The Godfather," Greatest film yet made
","BAR NONE! As of now, this film is the greatest film ever made. I'm sure something will eventually surpass it, but it'll really take a spectacular movie to do it. This film has it all - an extremely powerful, believable story, an all-star cast and a director (Francis Ford Coppola) who made the effort and took the time to do it right! The story is of a Mafia family in the 30's through the 60's and the events that catapult a son into control of the family's empire. Al Pacino, in particular, did a fantastic job as Michael Corleone, son of his father, although he didn't intend it to be that way. There is a lot of violence, but it's not there for violence's sake. The world of organized crime was much more violent in the past than it seems to be now and the violence is depicted as more or less just a part of doing business. This is perhaps Marlon Brando's greatest performance (as the father) ever. Other great actors include James Caan, Robert Duvall, John Cazale, Diane Keaton and Talia Shire. This is one of the best-cast films I've ever seen. I intend to always own a copy of this film!",10,1,4,2 February 2003
