Moneyball," Entertaining film, though it does dodge some issues...
","Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill make for a very entertaining, likable dynamic duo, and the character actors they've chosen to fill out the rest of the cast all work great together with the leads. I question the authenticity of everything that is put on display here, but i do have to admit that this makes for a very entertaining 'what if?' look into the world of a General Manager. Are they this impulsive? Are they truly more critical to the operation of a team then a manager is? This film paints the Manager as being a rather useless facade of a position.I do find it a bit glaring that they don't even mention the fact that the A's had a three-headed monster of Tim Hudson-Barry Zito-Mark Mulder that was unarguably the most dominant pitching trio of that era. With pitching in baseball, your team ALWAYS has a chance. This movie tries to paint the picture that Oakland didn't stand a prayer after losing Damon, Giambi and Isringhausen. With that pitching trio, they were always in competition.Also, dodging the Steroid issue and it's importance to Beane's MONEYBALL theoretics is a bit disingenuous. Still, it is a very entertaining film. Great performances from Pitt and Hill.I liked the movie. I don't know that it's entirely factual, but it does make for an interesting glimpse into the General Manager's world.",9,2,4,25 September 2011
Men in Black 3," Liked the first half, 2nd half was mediocre..
","...course, i've felt this way about all the MIB films. Ever since the first one, i remember going into it being super-excited and really wanting to love it, and i came out going 'Meh.'.. Same for MIB 2.... MIB 3 actually had a pretty good first half. In fact i made it to the midway point and felt like this was THE best MIB film.. Everything about the opening, the setup with the mystery of K and what he knows about J but won't tell.. Him disappearing.. The whole chocolate milk thing being an indicator for a fracture in the space-time continuum was out there and very neat. Heck traveling back in time and seeing MIB in the 60's was good, and Brolin nailed it as a young Tommy Lee Jones. Then along comes the 2nd half of the movie, that just feels SO rushed...The reveal of the mystery behind what K wasn't telling J was really handled poorly. That should have had more of an impact... Heck the whole bit at Cape Kennedy was just a real rushed finale with plenty of issues, and the father bit was really weak (not that it existed, but how he died.) Boris started off as the most interesting MIB villain, but by the end he was a sideshow. Once again, i walk away from one of these movies feeling 'meh' about it. I do not understand why they are so popular.",6,2,4,12 December 2012
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Liked the first film, loved this one!
","..saw this one at a late show last night... Have to say, as much as I enjoyed the first film (and I did very much enjoy Ritchie's take on Holmes!) this one just takes everything that was good and fun about the original and amps it up to 11.The chemistry between Law and Downey is just crackling. It is so much fun to watch these 2 natter at each other. The mutual love and respect is spoken thru actions, deeds and performance. Very well executed by both actors.The action sequences, a bit heavy-handed in the first film, are perfected in this one. Each and every one is an edge-of-your-seat affair, tremendously shot and executed.Stylish, yes, but the style doesn't make them as clunky as they were in the first film.Really hope there is a third entry in the series. The trio of Ritchie, Downey and Law are obviously having a lot of fun!",9,0,6,21 December 2011
Iron Man 3," Uneven entry, but more good then bad
","I should start this review by saying I continue to be surprised by just how positively the IRON MAN series has been received. I guess it's a tribute to the charisma of Robert Downey Jr. I felt the first film was GOOD, but not spectacular, yet Downey's performance seemed to be the key to making the movie accessible to the masses. I'm cool with that, as he's an incredible talent.The 2nd film in the series was pretty darned forgettable. I still have only watched it once and doubt i will ever watch it again. All i recall about it was the climactic fight was really a letdown.A lot of the stuff in 3 seemed pretty ham-fisted and unnecessary (squeezing a cutesy kid in for no real good reason, the Tony Stark anxiety attacks), and i'm not sure what to make of the end where they leave Stark's character. And all the Pepper stuff.... However the action sequences are top-notch, especially the Air Force One sequence and the finale. And the buddy-cop style scenes between Downey and Cheadle are ridiculously entertaining. It's a shame Cheadle is featured so little in the film until the final quarter. He was really strong. And finally Guy Pearce as the villain. I must say, it's a pretty poorly written character, but Pearce plays it with gusto. This guy should be bigger then he is. He's a wonderful actor who isn't afraid to take a chance.I've never been a huge reader of the IRON MAN comics, so i must say i can't get upset about the Mandarin stuff. Ben Kingsley has always been among my favourite actors, so it's always a plus when he shows up. I felt he did well with what he had. Overall I think it's a better entry then #2, but not quite up to the standard set by #1. It is a solid popcorn flick with some great action and a few decent one-liners.",7,0,1,11 May 2013
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," I really wanted to like this....
","...i found the novel to be an entertaining diversion... I've been a fan of Timur Bekmambetov's films 'NIGHT WATCH' and, especially 'WANTED..I really thought there was the potential for something pretty special here...A b-movie classic in the making.. Sadly the film really doesn't come close to living up to it's potential. This is probably the poorest editing I have seen in a feature film in quite some time. I was really looking forward to the action sequences, but all you got was a lot of grey mist and blurring.The script was really dopey, too. I'm not a huge fan of the stuff they added for the sake of action sequences to the story, because it was all REALLY dumb. I also don't much care for the ending they opted for here. The ending of the book had a whole lot more going for it. I loved the theme of 'Some men are just too interesting to die.'One giant surprise, though, was the performance from Benjamin Walker. This guy really knocks this role out of the ballpark. He has the acting chops to be a major star. It's too bad it was wasted on this poorly edited mess!",6,8,16,24 June 2012
Gravity," Visual feast, but a bit overrated
","..so after being told by a multitude of acquaintances that you just HAD to see this movie on the big screen, i finally caved and checked it out.I guess first off the good: This movie DOES warrant being seen on the big screen simply for the visuals. It has tremendous cinematography, and definitely has a bit of a different 'feel' then most space-based films. I've read that the director revolutionized how this type of movie was shot, and i can't disagree. And despite any complaints, this movie is never boring.It is, however, pretty ridiculous. As a kid growing up the space program was something that grabbed my attention and i absolutely drank up anything i could find on it. For someone who does their homework even on the most basic level, it's hard to take pretty much anything that happens in this movie seriously. And it all starts with the main character of Ryan Stone. I find it so hard to believe that someone like this would have passed the testing required to BE an astronaut. Yet, after we see all her deficiencies in plain view, we are then asked to believe that she could pull off stuff that even the best of the best would struggle with? Yikes. No, beautiful film, but i think it's REALLY overrated by the critics. It'll probably win a bunch of Oscars because it's hip and the industry loves Sandra, but i think that in 10 years it'll just be a footnote.",7,0,3,11 November 2013
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," The Final Act is incredible
","The way this movie sets up where the original Star Wars starts off is incredible. It would be nice if they had the time to establish the secondary characters a bit more, but i was actually impressed with how much they were able to establish for everyone given that this is a 1 and done story. There is not a wasted moment on the screen. Everything has a purpose of propelling the characters forward.There are some very surprisingly well-executed cameos, and a final scene that is everything us boys of the 70's and 80's have wanted in Star Wars since we first saw the thing.Really solid entry overall in the Star Wars saga. I have renewed faith in these suggested 'Side-story' films, now...",8,1,6,15 December 2016
World War Z," Great first half, so-so second...
","..So i was a fan of the original Max Brooks novel, but had heard enough about this movie going in to know not to expect it to be anything like that...So I went into this movie with no expectations, and honestly was pretty impressed for the first half. This was a real smart, intense, gritty portrayal of how the world and its governments could react to an outbreak such as this. I find it very telling to learn that pretty much everything in this movie after Israel was a re-write and re-shoot, because i found the tone and intelligence of the film took a dramatic shift with the plane sequence. Still, this is a fairly entertaining action picture that involves zombies. I would not call it horror, as it is shot to be very PG-13, but still the film is effective.",7,1,2,16 March 2014
Star Trek Into Darkness," One heck of a ride!
","..just got back from seeing Star Trek: Into Darkness in IMAX 3D (which, by the way, this movie is TOTALLY worth seeing in true IMAX 3D. Really gorgeous to look at.)I was a big fan of JJ Abrams first Star Trek flick, and went into this one as my most eagerly anticipated film of the summer. I am so gosh- darned happy to report that it did NOT disappoint. In fact it nearly shattered all of my expectations.The crew of the first film is back and in fine form. Tremendous chemistry and witty banter abound in the midst of chaotic action. The stand-outs here are Chris Pine's Kirk, Zach Quinto's Spock and Simon Pegg's Scotty. The burgeoning friendship of Spock and Kirk is on display here with more intensity and sincerity then i think has ever been shown before in any version of Trek. And I would be remiss if I did not mention the incredible performance from Benedict Cumberbatch. His villain (or...is he?) was just tremendous fun to watch. The plot has more plot twists then you can shake a stick at, and I must say this movie went places i never expected it too. My only real complaint is the predictability of the final act. Once we started paying homage to a certain-previous Trek film it became painfully obvious where it was headed. But the first 3/4's of this flick are a real solid and keep you guessing.So far this is the best film of the Summer.",9,4,9,21 May 2013
Ted," Good....but not great...
","...i have to admit i went into Ted with some moderately high expectations. Everyone i spoke to said it was hilarious..To be honest, though, i was a bit disappointed. It takes the same recycled FAMILY GUY style of joke, and cranks it at you for an hour and a half. Sometimes they hit, sometimes they miss, but i very rarely got a huge laugh out of this movie. More just chuckles here and there.The one GLARING exception is the scene with a certain star of an infamous campy sci-fi epic. THAT part had me rolling.Everything else in the movie just felt like stale Family Guy.I do have to admit that my admiration for Mark Wahlberg as an actor grows. He was a real sport going along with this concept.",7,1,4,8 July 2012
Fast & Furious 6," From guilty pleasure to quality heist film!
","I had kinda given up on these movies after 2 Fast, 2 Furious, skipping Tokyo Drift.. When Fast Five came out i had SO many people at work telling me 'oh it was awesome' and with all the buzz Fast 6 was getting, i splurged on the Best Buy 10 buck deal and picked up Fast 4 and 5 and watched them... They were entertaining... Fast 6, though, really does take it to a whole new level. The action and stunt choreography were incredible, the twist of who the mole was in Hobbes' team was a legit surprise, and Giselle's death really caught me off-guard and struck me emotionally. You knew Han had to die eventually (he had become my favourite character in the 3 films), and i think i might actually go back to watch Tokyo Drift just to see the end of his character properly. This was a really good movie. Justin Lin has got to be one of the most underrated action directors going right now!",8,5,8,23 August 2013
Suicide Squad," It was okay, but could have been more
","...i was 1 of the few who enjoyed 'Batman Vs. Superman' (was not such a huge fan of 'Man of Steel'), so I was interested in seeing the next step in this new DC theatrical universe..For the most part it was okay. Decently entertaining. Margot Robbie predictably steals the movie, but Viola Davis is quite good playing a very cool and efficient Amanda Waller. Will Smith is serviceable as Deadshot. The eye-opener for me was Cara Delevingne. Her Enchantress character, in the early going, was very intriguing. I think the most disappointing performance in the movie was Jared Leto's Joker. Maybe it is because he didn't really have much to work with, but he was really kind of a non-entity for me. I didn't find him interesting in the slightest, which is about the worst thing i think you could say about a character like The Joker. The movie itself is stronger in its first half then it is in its second. I preferred the DIRTY DOZEN-esque recruitment scenes, when you didn't really know who you could trust, or when Amanda would kill someone. The second half of the film becomes a paint by numbers 'Everyone comes together to save the day' super hero flick. That was disappointing. Still, most of the characters were colourful and interesting, and it leaves off at a point where i am interested in seeing what comes next for the DCU.I'm still in for the long haul.",7,3,6,4 August 2016
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Marvel Phase 2 finally has a great one
","The first IRON MAN was the movie that put the MARVEL franchise on the map, but i always felt like the best film of the cycle was, surprisingly, the first THOR. It came out of nowhere to really blow me away, as I was never really much of a THOR fan.Going into Phase 2.0 of the Marvel flicks i have to admit that I'd been disappointed with the offerings so far. IRON MAN 3 probably stands as the worst film in the franchise thus-far, and my high hopes for a repeat of THOR's success was sadly letdown by THOR 2.I started to wonder if the Marvel movies hadn't lost a step. I shouldn't have worried, as CAPTAIN America: THE WINTER SOLDIER has arrived. With tremendous action, great characters and a smart script that respects its audience, i have to say that this could very well be THE best Avengers movie yet. Nevermind the next AVENGERS movie (which of course i am excited for), but I can't wait for CAPTAIN America 3, and the search for the Winter Soldier!!Great job, Marvel!",9,2,4,4 April 2014
Pacific Rim," One of those movies that you walk out of, and immediately want to go and watch it again...
","....i loved this movie. A WHOLE bunch. When you hear the description of a movie as 'giant monsters fight giant robots', Guillermo Del Toro managed to realize EVERY thing i could have possibly imagined in my head as a dreamt about what such a beast would be like...and then he turned it to 11.The entire 2nd half of this movie has more wicked-awesome action moments then all the other films i have seen this year combined. A bombastic score. Capable cast of mostly TV actors who play their roles well, and are likable, and Ron Perlman in one of his greatest bit- parts that i have ever seen.I will be picking this up on Blu-Ray the day it is released, as i imagine it will deliver a GREAT experience on a quality home theatre system.",10,1,8,14 July 2013
Ant-Man," Solid entry in the Marvel catalogue
","Like many, i was first excited to hear that Edgar Wright was making a Marvel movie, and then disappointed when he left it at the 11th hour. I went into Ant-Man cautiously optimistic, but came out having thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Paul Rudd and Michael Pena steal the show. They both have incredible comedic timing. Any time the film starts to head down the road of stale clichés, 1 of those 2 enters the scene to keep thing sharp and fresh. Evangeline Lily is a nice addition to the Marvel stable, as well. I look forward to her in future installments. The action sequences are very imaginative, and top-notch, and the interplay between the main-players is very entertaining. About the only weak point of the movie is the villain. He reminds me very much of Jeff Bridges character in the original Iron Man. He's really just there as a foil to give our heroes purpose. He's adequate, but hardly memorable. Ant-Man is a nice addition to the MCU films.",8,5,14,16 July 2015
Oblivion," Are you an effective team?
","Yes, this movie is a mishmash of a number of other sci-fi flicks, but it tells it's story competently and is an absolute incredible feast for the eyes. Joseph Kosinski sure does know how to make a beautiful looking flick. Cruise, Kurylenko and especially Andrea Riseborough all give terrific performances. Kudos, as well, to the score by M83. Overall it is a very enjoyable sensory experience. If you have any desire to see this i highly recommend checking it out on the big screen, and preferably in IMAX. Really solid flick.",8,9,14,21 April 2013
Man of Steel," Disappointment
","So normally i am a Zack Snyder fan (and in recent years, let me tell ya, that hasn't been easy to defend with most!) I loved 'DAWN OF THE DEAD', enjoyed '300', really liked his adaptation of 'WATCHMEN', and....well, did like the action sequences in 'Suckerpunch'... (admittedly it was a weak flick in other areas..)Going into 'Man of Steel' was hoping for the best, and i came out with what arguably dukes it out with 'Suckerpunch' as Snyder's worst film. Saw MoS in 3D IMAX, and let's get this off the top right away, the 3D was terrible. It added nothing to the movie, other then pretty much draining it of all colour. I did like Cavill as Superman and Shannon as Zod. Heck, i liked Crowe as Jor-El as well. The Krypton stuff was pretty interesting to open the movie. I think i had real issues with the writing. Everything seemed unnecessarily convoluted when it came to the powers of the Kryptonians. So it's the atmosphere that gives them super powers? But their suits still give them super abilities, too? On the ship, when Jor-El adjusts the atmosphere to give Clark his powers back, shouldn't the entire ship have been filled with choking super-freaks with heat vision shooting all over the place? I also really disliked the death of Jonathan Kent. Poorly conceived and written, and actually does more to HURT the character of Martha then anything else. For the rest of the movie any time she is dishing out advice to Clark all i can think is 'Don't listen to her, remember she sent Jonathan back for the dog!'My final gripe is with the Lois/Clark dynamic. It was rushed and poorly executed. It doesn't help that Adams is way too old for the part. I like her, and think 10 years ago she would have been great, but she is too old for Cavill. There was just no believable chemistry between the 2. When she says 'it's all downhill after the first kiss', all you can think to respond with was 'it wasn't really flying to begin with, honey.'The action sequences are murky and confusing (though that may be due heavily to the terrible 3D conversion.) There's a lot of CGI of explosions and buildings getting demolished, but the shots are from such a distance that it's hard to tell who or what is causing it..Overall, pretty disappointed in this effort. I think Cavill could serve as a pretty good Superman down the road... Hopefully the next movie gets it right?",6,2,5,23 June 2013
Ender's Game," Fan of the book, and finally watched the movie...
","..and actually was surprised to say i kinda liked it.. I mean, it doesn't come anywhere close to including all the depth and complexity of the novel.. There are definitely many things that get glossed over (like the Valentine/Peter stuff), but at the same time i don't think you could realistically cram ALL of that into one film. But i felt like it did a decent job of giving a cliff-notes version of the tale of Ender in a fairly satisfying format. The ending is a bit rushed, i think they could have done with some more characterization of what Ender was really trying to do, becoming Speaker for the Dead, but... Otherwise.. It did a decent job of realizing the settings of the Battle School and the Ansible battles pretty well.",8,0,1,18 February 2014
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Among the best of the X-men movies..
","...seeing Bryan Singer back here REALLY makes you wonder what kind of movie he might've been able to craft out of X-Men 3..It is so nice to have him back at the helm of this franchise. In my mind X-Men 2 and X-Men: First Class are neck and neck as the best entries in the franchise, and i'm happy to report that Days of Future Past manages a happy medium between these 2, and propels itself into that same tier.The film has a pretty tight script for a subject that is so complicated. It handles the back and forth through time quite well.Above all else it's the cast and characters that make this movie work. Michael Fassbender, James McAvoy, Hugh Jackman and Jennifer Lawrence carry the majority of the load here, and they are all in fine form. Of course you have living legends in Ian Mackellen and Patrick Stewart who never disappoint, and finally you've got Peter Dinklage who is another class act, new to this series. I do miss the musical score from First Class, but otherwise this is an incredibly solid entry in the pantheon of comicbook cinema. Can't wait for the next one!",8,1,2,23 May 2014
Captain America: Civil War," Winter Soldier was the best Marvel movie....until now
","This is how you do a comicbook fight movie. Every character's motivations is well-defined and completely believable. Why are Cap and Tony on different sides? Why is Cap so protective of the Winter Soldier? Why is Black Panther after the Winter Soldier? Why is Tony? All of this stuff is explained well, and some of the explanations will surprise you. Friends side against friends. People that don't particularly like each other join forces, and it is all so well done.The intro of Spider-man is exciting, and Ant-man has about the most incredible moment in the movie (and that is saying something.)The Marvel Franchise still has A LOT of juice left in it.",9,3,8,5 May 2016
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," I liked the first one more...
","There were some good sequences, and this WAS a good film, don't get me wrong! But i found that there was more emotional connection and impact with the characters in the first HOBBIT then there was here...That barrel sequence was really well-executed and thought out....most of the rest of the action was a bit lame, though i did like Evangeline Lily's character a whole lot more then i thought i was going to.And Smaug was really excellent to see on the big screen.Overall, though, the movie did seem a BIT padded out. I really think they could've done this in 2. Still, it was decent enjoyment.",7,0,3,18 December 2013
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Fiennes knocks this one out of the park!
","I expected to enjoy 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' because Wes Anderson is a filmmaker who is generally considered 'an acquired taste', and I have quite simply acquired it.I did not expect, however, to love the film as much as I did. Ralph Fiennes gives an incredible performance at the centre of this movie. What inspired casting. I really hope he becomes a regular in Anderson's stable of actors, because he takes this movie and runs with it with seemingly no effort. M. Gustave is just a fantastic, fascinating character. The rest of the cast, as you would expect, is quite solid, but make no mistake this is Fiennes' vehicle and he drives this one straight to pay- dirt.Of course, with Anderson, you can expect a certain level of fairy-tale quirkiness and a set-design and sense of colour that is virtually un- matched in this day and age. 'LIFE AQUATIC WITH STEVE ZISSOU' has stood tall for many years as my favourite of Anderson's works, but i think that in 'GRAND BUDAPEST' we may FINALLY have a challenger to the throne..",9,0,3,30 March 2014
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Disappointed
","I have to admit that when I heard Brad Bird was doing a Mission Impossible film, i got excited. I have loved all of Bird's animated efforts, especially 'THE INCREDIBLES', which was a tremendous action flick in it's own right that obviously owed a lot to James Bond. The idea of him getting to do a spy movie like MI seemed like a match made in heaven.It pains me to have to say, after the fact, that i was a bit disappointed in this effort. It suffers from the same issues that MI: III had, mainly too many cheesy, forced and hokey elements.There are some decent action sequences, to be sure, but there is so much wasted potential here for something that truly could have been great.As it stands, it's another forgettable blockbuster.Very surprised by all of the positive reviews. This is very middle of the road.",6,2,7,27 December 2011
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Surprisingly driven by emotions and character
","I have to admit, when i first saw the trailer for this one i thought it looked awfully silly and quite honestly figured it would bomb.I was really surprised to hear so much positive critical attention as we approached the launch date, and so I rolled the dice and decided to check this one out.I have to say the trailer does not do it justice. You have no real concept of what the film is about.The effects group at WETA really outdid themselves this time, as did Andy Serkis. It's so nice to see such a likable guy produce such quality stuff.I was completely floored by what a great flick this was.",9,2,4,8 August 2011
Drive," Understated, intense and surprisingly poignant
","...just got back from seeing 'DRIVE'...Loved the performances from Carey Mulligan and Ryan Gosling. The things that they said with just a look, or a shifting of the lips, or even the touch of a smile.... One of my favourite on-screen romances of the past 5 years.Great soundtrack. Great direction. Great cinematography and great performances all the way around (Albert Brooks gives a great turn, as does the always impressive Bryan Crantson!) Add to that some of the most intense, brilliantly shot car scenes that i can recall seeing.What else could you ask for in a movie?",10,3,8,18 September 2011
Frozen," My soon-to-be 5 year old daughter was blown away by this
","..took my family of wife, 7 year old son and 4.80 year old daughter to see FROZEN today..And what an absolute blast it was for all involved. My 7 year old, usually grumpy when it comes to the 'girly' flicks came away really enjoying the comedic stylings of Olaf the snowman, but my daughter... OH man did this movie grip my daughter and not let her go. She was wide- eyed, totally enraptured by what was on screen. As we walked out of the theatre she was singing all of Elsa's songs to herself, and this performance continued the entire ride home, through bath and now into bed time..The 3D is top-notch, there is good humour for everyone (shouldn't someone tell Olaf about the summer...?) I can't recommend this highly enough as a family experience..The kids quite enjoyed the Mickey Mouse short beforehand, too, which was actually a very imaginative and well-executed effort.",9,4,10,1 December 2013
The Bourne Legacy," Pretty solid entry in the Bourne series...
","..just got back from seeing this one...I've enjoyed all of the previous Bourne films, but went into this one with some lowered expectations due to the August release date (this is usually trash time). I have to say i came out thoroughly impressed with the effort that was put forward. It's a very solid entry in the Bourne series.The action sequences are intense and top notch, one sequence in particular that takes place in a science lab was actually fairly harrowing.. You could hear a pin drop in the theatre. There's some very good acting from Rachel Weisz there. Jeremy Renner does a solid job stepping into the lead (though this is a different character from Jason Bourne.) Edward Norton, as always, gives a great performance as the government head hounding our heroes.Overall, a very solid summer flick. Worth checking out if you enjoyed the previous films.",7,2,7,10 August 2012
X-Men: Apocalypse," Another solid X-Men movie
","...For a long time i felt like X2: X-Men United was the best comicbook movie i had ever seen, but both Marvel and Matthew Vaughn have raised the bar significantly, so now I feel like Bryan Singer tends to 'play it safe'. And that's what he does here with X-Men: Apocalypse. It is a good film. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender continue to be a tremendous Xavier-Magneto tandem, and Oscar Isaac is a solid villain. Evan Peters' Quicksilver steals the show (again), but Sophie Turner's Jean Grey is a surprisingly intriguing character. They handle Jean well. It is also nice to finally get Scott Summers on the team, as he is the quintessential X-Man. That being said, Olivia Munn is underwhelming as Psylocke, and they really waste Archangel. Jennifer Lawrence really mails this one in, but I feel like there just isn't much left for them to do with Mystique, outside of killing her (which they SHOULD do.) Overall a solid film, and worth watching if you are an X-Fan.",7,8,18,27 May 2016
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," One of the better Spidey films!
","Just got back from a matinée showing of 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2'.Actually feel like it is an improvement over the first TASM film in many regards. First off: The 3D is spectacular. They use it to great effect with Spider-Man vaulting through the city. This is one of the few films that I think really should be seen in 3D. There was one scene where some glass fell towards the screen that actually made me flinch and blink!Next up: Andrew Garfield is tremendous as Spider-man. As much as I liked Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker, Garfield's Spidey just never shuts his mouth and constantly has a wise-crack with 3 more ready to go... THIS is the Spider-man from the comics, and i love him for it.I'm not the world's biggest Jaime Foxx fan, and i was kinda dreading what the trailers made his Electro look like, but i actually felt he was an effective villain with well-established motivations. I also really enjoyed Dane DeHaan's Harry Osborne. Really looking forward to seeing the Osborne-Parker rivalry play out in future films. This movie has a good heart, and some very real emotional punch. I would list it as the best Spider-man film in the franchise.....2nd only to Raimi's 'Spider-Man 2'.",8,1,6,2 May 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy," Just a rip-roaring good time!
","With James Gunn at the helm i was expecting something different, quirky and smart. What i wasn't prepared for was a movie with such heart-felt emotion. You really wind up loving these characters, and rooting for them. They are truly the underdog group that really has no business being at the Marvel party table, but gosh-darnit they are just impertinent enough to crash the party and take it over with style.The 3D in this was stellar. A lot of movies aren't worth the extra price of a 3D ticket, but this one is definitely worth your time. The 3D is very well-done. Finally I have to give kudos to the one-liners. There are some great, great one-liners here that are setup well and hit home with authority. This could very well be the best movie of the Summer. Who would've guessed it?",8,1,4,1 August 2014
Evil Dead," Actually surprised by how well this captures the spirit of the original
","...i have to admit i fell in love with Sam Raimi with the first film of his I saw, 'Army of Darkness' (saw it at a 2nd run theatre in Warren, Michigan way back in the day!) When i found out this was actually the 3rd in a trilogy, i immediately set out finding the first 2 parts to watch them. Boy was i surprised to discover that the original EVIL DEAD would be one of the most sadistic roller-coaster rides of horror that I would ever experience...Now i was someone who, upon hearing about a remake, had the immediate reaction of 'SACRILEGE!' It seemed like such an insanely bad idea. The original is one of those iconic flicks in horror history. Why remake it?I put off seeing it for the first 4 weekends of it's release, but when I needed an excuse to get out to the movies this weekend, it was the only one on the docket i was remotely interested in, so in I went.And gosh-darnit if i didn't have a darned similar experience to the one i had the first time i watched EVIL DEAD. The violence on screen was deliciously stomach-churning at times, exactly as the original film had made me feel. It was lacking in the kinetic, comicbook style of Raimi's original, instead opting for the darker, grainier look of the modern horror film, but the violence was unrelenting. Just when you thought it couldn't get worse in a scene, it always managed to. That's how the original finale of Raimi's classic made me feel. It was like 'Gore upon gore upon gore'. This won't replace Raimi's classic, but it did a much better job of capturing the feel of the original then I ever thought it would or could.",7,10,27,27 April 2013
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Solid, if slightly flawed, entry in the Marvel Universe
","...Phase 2 of the Marvel movies had been batting .500 for me. I did not enjoy Iron Man 3 or Thor: Dark World, but really dug Guardians of the Galaxy and Captain America: Winter Soldier (Cap 2 is probably the best film in the entire Marvel series!)Based on that, I don't think I am surprised that I came out of Age of Ultron with mixed feelings. Overall it is a solid entry, but it is by no means flawless. The good:Really liked the intro of Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver. I liked the horror-movie tropes tied to Scarlet Witch (she is a Witch afterall!) and Aaron Taylor-Johnson's Quicksilver had a lot of personality.The action, of course, was great. And Hawkeye actually had something to do in this film. The Vision: They did such an incredible job building mystique around this character.The Bad:Wasn't a fan of that extended scene at the Farm. That stopped the movie cold. I know some people say 'It was necessary for character development', but the previous films had done such a poor job of giving Hawkeye any character that seeing him on the Farm did absolutely nothing for me.The romance: Ugh. Talk about forced. I like Ruffalo's Banner. I really do. I was surprised how much i did in the first Avengers, cause i'm usually not a Ruffalo fan. But I just did not see any chemistry between Ruffalo and Scar-Jo. And where was the build-up to this? Last time we saw these 2 together Hulk was trying to smash Black Widow. Marvel needs to work on their female-story lines.Ultron was kind of a lame villain. I don't think there was enough build-up for him. He just sorta showed up and was evil.Overall: Is it worth seeing in the theatre? Yes of course it is. But it is not without its flaws, and sure doesn't top Cap 2.",8,73,127,4 May 2015
Hotel Transylvania," Solid Family Entertainment
","..took my family to see this one today, 6 year old son, 3 year old daughter..Both of them really enjoyed the experience, though to be honest i think my daughter connected with the movie more because of the plight of Dracula's young daughter being the focal point of the story. That really surprised me!Any horror fan with kids will get a real kick out of this one. And even non-horror fans should find the story cute. Sandler and company really pull it together for this one, after their last couple of films were less then stellar.Definitely a pleasant surprise, and good fun for the whole family.",7,44,64,8 October 2012
Elysium," Wanted to love it, only wound up kinda liking it..
","...like everyone else, i came out of DISTRICT 9 absolutely blown away, and dying for the next project to come from this new talent with the name like a James Bond villain..When the first trailers came for 'Elysium' I was excited. Talents like Matt Damon and Jodie Foster were onboard! I was ready to absolutely LOVE this movie..After having seen it, i must say i was...not necessarily disappointed, but underwhelmed would be a good word to describe it.Oh there is some good action, but it's not AS good as the action in D9. The characters are likable enough, but not anywhere near as likable or interesting as the characters in D9.The movie has tremendous fx, and a great sense of stylistic design, but the movie is very paint by numbers, and actually felt a bit rushed in it's finale. Too much time spent on the fx, i think, and not enough fleshing out the characterization and the story. Too bad, because this REALLY could have been something special. As it stands, i would call it 'the sophomore slump'.",7,0,2,17 August 2013
Zero Dark Thirty," Good film, not a great. Yet I can't stop thinking about it....
","So i must confess that I feel the same way about 'Zero Dark Thirty' as i did about 'THE HURT LOCKER'. Both are good films that are competently made, but they both seem to be lacking that character-investment factor that REALLY elevates a good movie to a great one. Outside of Jessica Chastain's character (which, you can't deny, is a terrific performance and a great role-model for independent women!) there is NO one else in this movie that you can connect with. No other character is developed in any way. Like when the Seal Team shows up. They show up and you are almost immediately thrown into an action sequence where we are expected to care about these people, but we have NO connection to them whatsoever. All that being said, my initial reaction to the film was underwhelming. Not surprised, really, as after her previous film i went into this one expecting to be underwhelmed, and Ms. Bigelow didn't disappoint.And yet.....I find that 3 days after i saw the movie i am still thinking about it. I am still coming on these boards and discussing it. So maybe its' a better movie then i give it credit for.There are some silly moments, to be sure (one attack in particular is presented with some very glaring issues of stupidity), but overall it is a good film. Not the best of the year by any stretch, but it is pretty good.",7,1,7,14 January 2013
Hercules," Very underrated Disney entry.
","So i picked this one up for 50% off at one of the local big box stores. My 4 year old daughter is in a real Disney phase right now, just devouring everything. We were at the point where we were picking up the more obscure Disney flicks from the 90's, like HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME and TARZAN (which we have found for dirt cheap!) I remembered seeing this back when it first came out in 97, and remember feeling like it was more of a boy movie, but for the price i figured 'eh, if she even watches it once we got our money's worth out of it.'My daughter had worn the DVDs for 'SLEEPING BEAUTY' and 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' right out, but neither of them compare to how much she loves 'HERCULES'! Ever since i bought the movie a week ago she has watched the movie 2 times a day, each day, since then. It has trumped her love of every other Disney movie! I know a lot of people feel like Meg is a side character who doesn't really connect with most young girls, but my daughter looks at her as the absolute best Disney Princess of them all.I also have to say that 'I won't say I'm in Love' has gotta be near the top of the list of the most under-appreciated, underrated Disney songs. My daughter keeps asking for me to replay that song over and over and over, and she dances up a storm to it. If you're thinking this movie might not appeal to the young Disney Princess in your life, think again.Really a gem for what you pay for it, right now!",8,1,3,6 January 2013
The Conjuring," I guess horror is subjective...
","....because i really didn't find this movie particularly scary.. It was actually pretty by-the-numbers... The best sequence was ruined because of the trailers showing it (the whole hand clapping bit.)I liked the cast. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga are 2 actors who i seem to like in everything. And there were SOME neat bits (like when Lili Taylor is covered with the sheet, and then vomits blood on it from the inside) but overall i found the whole thing pretty predictable. Everything that will happen is spelt out for you far in advance. It was technically well-made, i suppose. James Wan knows how to make a movie LOOK good, but i feel like it was a bit over-hyped as far as 'great horror' goes.",7,0,0,16 March 2014
Prometheus," Ridley Scott still has it
","...I have to admit that, when I heard about Prometheus, i was EXCITED, but cautiously so. Mr. Scott had made some exceptional films over the years, and that he was somehow revisiting the universe which really put him on the map, way back in 1979, i was quite intrigued.At the same time, Mr. Scott's more recent efforts (Kingdom of Heaven, Robin Hood, American Gangster, A Good Year) hadn't exactly been spectacular (I know many people tell me to watch the director's cut of Kingdom, but i was so thoroughly disappointed by the theatrical cut that i just can't bring myself to risk it.)My excitement got the better of me so I decided to go to an opening IMAX 3D screening of this one, and boy... Am I glad i did.Ridley absolutely still has some big time films in him. To take a film billing itself as a prequel to ALIEN, and turn it into a grandiose adventure to attempt to meet our g(G)od(s) was just incredibly unexpected and bold.But good gosh, what a beautifully shot, cinematic adventure!More science fiction then horror, there ARE a couple of segments that will turn the stomach of the unprepared, including one scene that i swear hearkens back to the intensity and stomach-churning horror of that classic scene in ALIEN...The best thing i can say about this film: When it was finished i wanted to get back in line and see it again. A must-see on the big screen.",9,8,17,9 June 2012
The Wolverine," Surprisingly good!
",".. i must admit that X-Men: The Last Stand and X-Men Origins: Wolverine had left a real bad taste in my mouth with regards to anything related to this character. X-Men: First Class was a good step in righting the franchise again, but when i saw there was another Wolverine movie i had zero motivation to check it out.Found the Blu-Ray on-sale for 10 bucks, however, and being the comic nerd that I am, i finally decided to give it a chance.Colour me surprised to say I actually quite enjoyed it. It's much less action-oriented and more on the character-driven side, which was refreshing.Mariko and Yukio were both really well-realized characters. I really enjoyed the by-play and chemistry between Wolverine and Yukio. I was happy to see the setup for them to be adventuring together moving forward. Hope that Mangold and company stick with that.Good film! Hopefully X-Men: Days of Future Past can build on this and continue the upturn.",8,1,2,1 May 2014
The Croods," Surprisingly touching, fine entertainment for the entire family
","... i have to admit that THE CROODS really did nothing for me during it's primary theatrical run. I had no desire to see it, and honestly it didn't appear to hold any appeal for my 6 year old and 4 year old children.However, it was playing at a second run theatre in Michigan, and it's the summer time, so I bit the bullet, paid 4.50 and took my 2 kids to see it and man am i ever glad i did.Surprisingly touching film about a family with some great messages for EVERY member that is told in an entertaining manner that managed to hold the attentions of BOTH of my kids (not always an easy task!)The message and humour works on all levels, and i have to say that even i had a bit of a tear in my eye during the finale.A surprisingly cute film that wound up being a great way to spend a summer afternoon with the kids.",7,1,1,10 July 2013
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Honestly surprised how much i liked it.
","....i should start off with admitting i was not a fan of 'MAN OF STEEL'. Henry Cavill has the chiseled look of SUPERMAN, but had about as much charisma as a plank of wood. I felt like he and Amy Adams had zero chemistry, and that really let that film down. I also felt like we would never see anyone that could top Christian Bale's Bruce Wayne.Going into Batman vs. Superman i wasn't expecting much. The first thing they did right: Make this more a Batman movie then a Superman movie. Shifting the focus to Ben Affleck was the right move for a film of this magnitude. He actually has the ability to carry this material. I also like the approach they took with Batman. His humanity really gives this movie heart. You understand and empathize with his motivations. He makes no apologies for who and what he is, and i think that really is a fresh take for the character. Basically: Affleck's Batman is a huge win here. I think they've planted some very intriguing seeds for other films, moving forward. Yes there was a lot to cram into this movie, but i actually feel like they did about as good a job as you could hope for. Actually a decent film to build on for future installments.",8,12,21,25 March 2016
Thor: The Dark World," Hiddleston steals the entire show
","In the original run of Marvel movies i think the one that i expected the least from was the first THOR. I was surprised when that one actually came out as the BEST of the Marvel flicks leading up to AVENGERS. Heading into 'THOR: THE DARK WORLD' my expectations were significantly higher (though after Iron Man 3, maybe I should have tapered them), and thus i came out of this one slightly disappointed. Hemsworth's Thor really doesn't have much character development in this one. He was much more enjoyable as the spoiled-boy prince who earns the right to wield Mjolnir. Here he's kinda wooden as the wounded-puppy longing for Jane Foster. And when you see what Foster has been up to you really wonder what the guy could ever see in her. Honestly, the human characters in Thor 2 are the weakest link. Too much bad writing and too many cheap jokes that fall flat. Kat Dennings brings her '2 Broke Girls' shtick to the movie and it bombs badly. Portman's Foster is a pretty unlikable witch of a character. And what have they done to Stellan Skarsgard?Chris O'Dowd appears to be written as a poor sap of a nice guy who is being passed over for He-of-the-golden-locks, but he actually comes out as someone you root for and want to tell 'Hey, buddy, it's okay. You're better then her anyways!'That's the real problem with the movie, the only person you really root for is Loki!!And how easy that is, as Hiddleston just chews this movie up and eats it for breakfast. Anytime he is on screen, the enjoyment factor goes up.The bad guys have a real cool look to them, but they aren't really developed to any point where they felt like a threat. And while interesting in concept, the final fight is head-scratchingly yawn inducing.It was nice to see Rene Russo actually have something to do here, and Hopkins was once again solid as Odin. And thank goodness for that saw-it-coming-but-still-lovely-to-see twist ending.I liked it. It was okay. But it wasn't as good as the first Thor.High hopes for CAPTAIN America:WINTER SOLDIER.",7,1,3,8 November 2013
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," New cast is strong in a decent Star Wars outing
","Force Awakens is a nice start for the Disney-era of Star Wars. Its not the greatest Star Wars movie ever made, but they put together a very solid nucleus of young actors to build the new trilogy on.Daisy Ridley and John Boyega are the best parts about the movie. Their performances and chemistry are very fun to watch. You really root for these 2.I also like Adam Driver's performance as the conflicted Kylo Ren. He is a tortured soul, and that comes across very well.I liked what we saw from Oscar Isaac as well, though i hope we get more of him in future entries.The plot kinda recycles old school Star Wars plot lines, but that isn't so bad. This is a good start for Disney.",8,3,17,18 December 2015
The Purge," Interesting concept, lame execution, but still kinda watchable.
","...When i first heard about the concept of this film i thought 'well, that sounds neat.'I like dreary, dark '20 minutes into the future' type social commentaries. Add in Lena Headey and Ethan Hawke and i admit i'll give your movie a chance. And the setup for this movie is really a game breaker for most. Either you can buy that a government would come to the conclusion that an event like THE PURGE is beneficial to society and therefore you can 'go with' the film, or you think its ridiculously stupid and check out right at the start.I was the former. Yes the film is flawed, and it iss somewhat questionable that any child raised in this environment would behave the way the boy in this film did, but i felt like there was enough action and tension that my interest was held throughout. Not a great movie, but a solid b-style suspense/thriller.",7,0,0,9 March 2014
Godzilla," Less is more
","..the flavour of the day with GODZILLA 2014 is that less is more.Having loved Gareth Edwards' 'MONSTERS', i was quite excited when i heard he was helming this new GODZILLA-entry. Tack on the incredible acting names that he pulled (Ken Watanabe, Bryan Cranston, Elizabeth Olsen, David Strathairn) and i gotta say i expected more then your average Godzilla entry.And boy did we get it. I really liked how the Monsters had personality, and really they weren't BAD guys. They just paid us no heed, really, as we are like ants to them. Its all very similar to 'MONSTERS' in that regard. They are really just trying to exist in this world.The action set-pieces were awe-inspiring in their scale. Very exciting, and the build-up to the final fight was incredible. I really hope Gareth Edwards is involved with the next film in the series. He knows how to bring a rare humanity to giant-monster-scifi!",8,4,9,22 May 2014
Deadpool," Surprisingly....great?
","I must confess i went into Deadpool with low expectations. I like the character, and felt like Ryan Reynolds was good casting, but the February release date had me a bit nervous..... tack on the lackluster commercial campaign with what seemed like forced-laughs and i have to admit i was a bit nervous...After seeing the movie you totally get WHY the commercials were so iffy: All of the best stuff was completely inappropriate for a commercial. This one goes all out, full throttle for that R-rating, and thank goodness it did! What a tremendously fun film with a surprising amount of heart.. The love story is quite touching.Also, i think this may be Stan Lee's best cameo yet. Very good movie. Look forward to the sequel!!",8,5,16,12 February 2016
Inside Llewyn Davis," The Coens need a hug!
","Won tickets to a special sneak-peek of INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS.Coming from the Coens, of course, it is an incredibly well-made picture that's deeper then the surface tale suggests. Goodness gracious me, though, their past couple of films have been awfully down on how we interact with the universe!Oscar Issac gives a tremendous performance at the core of the movie, with deeply emotional folk music performances. The rest of the ensemble is solid, but i think pretty much all the other performers really classify as supporting characters, as they all take turns fading in and out of the story. Oscar is the films rock, it's heart and it's soul. He's the one who we go on this incredible journey with, and he is up to the task.Deeply ruminating film that is more then worth a look. Probably worth multiple viewings.",8,1,2,18 December 2013
The Cabin in the Woods," If you are a true blue horror fan, you owe it to yourself to see this...
","....I have to admit that initially, the title 'The Cabin in the Woods' didn't really do anything for me.Then i saw a trailer for the film, and it looked like just your average cheesy horror flick, BUT THEN i saw that clip with the bird smacking into some sort of force field, and i thought 'hmm, maybe there's more to it...' And then i saw 'JOSS WHEDON', and i was all in. The guy who brought us stuff like 'Firefly' and 'Dr. Horrible' is doing what looks to be an Evil-Deadish horror flick? I'm in...Of course it's scope winds up being SO much more then just a standard slasher flick..The makers obviously have a huge love for ALL things horror... I don't want to say much more without spoilers, but i will say there are laughs, there are shocks, and there are breasts.And terrific performances from top to bottom. Do yourself a favour and check it out.",9,1,10,14 April 2012
Warcraft," Flawed, but finishes strong
","So I played Warcraft II and III as a kid. I put 6+ Years into the World of Warcraft. I am a fan.That being said, I found this movie to be bit of a mixed bag. It is rather bloated. I can't tell if it was overlong, or if there was just too much story to tell in the time allotted. At times it felt rushed, and other times it seemed a bit slow. They do do a good job of developing the characters. By the final quarter of the film you are invested and care about these people. And boy that final quarter REALLY is strong. The movie ends very well, with a lot of action and denouement, and then a LOT of setups for sequels. And I left the theatre WANTING to see those sequels. There is a lot of fan service here, and most of it is very smartly done. Overall, as a fan of the franchise, i was pleased with the film. It wasn't spectacular, but it is a good start for what are hopefully going to be more movies.",7,2,3,9 June 2016
