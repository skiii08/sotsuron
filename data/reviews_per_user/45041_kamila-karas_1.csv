Black Swan," Not too impressed
","A love-it-or-hate-it movie. Aronofsky blurs the line between reality and fantasy, turning the film into a Gothic horror show that is fascinating and disappointing in equal measure. Nothing is perfect; Mark Heyman, Andres Heinz, and John J. McLaughlin's script does have beautiful and organic (and almost poetic) dialogue, but the film does have its moments where it feels over-saturated and some superfluous plot devices could have been scrapped. In addition, some minor side characters were a bit underdeveloped.Regardless of its flaws, none of which are necessarily damning, Black Swan marks an important chapter in director Darren Aronofsky's career. His direction (which reminded me of Stanley Kubrick's trademark technique â€” a compliment no doubt), alongside a beautiful score which consists of some of Swan Lake's most famous tunes, tie the film up very nicely, making it a true herculean masterpiece.",Null,1,2,1 April 2014
