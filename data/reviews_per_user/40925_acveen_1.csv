Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A masterpiece, but some people don't understand it.
","It's not the best Star Wars movie, but it's certainly a masterpiece. It shows a totaly new concept of scenography and special efects, but also keeps traditional Star Wars atmosphere. Maybe it look a little bit naive, but almost every word in TPM has it's own hidden meaning. For example, the connection between the sentence 'you have brought hope to those who have no hope' by Shmi Skywalker and the title of Episode IV, 'A New Hope'. Try to think about that for a while!",10,0,0,2 January 2000
