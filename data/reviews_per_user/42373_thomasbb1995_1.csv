The Blair Witch Project," What A Shocker!!!
","I was not part of the generation who would have known all about the Blair witch project and so when my friend told me about it i didn't really want to watch it.my dad is a movie buff and knows almost every movie out there is out there and told me that when this movie came out that there was huge speculation over whether it was real or not, so i borrowed the movie off of my cousin and looking at the cover i thought oh god what a cheap movie it is going to be crap! but i was wrong although this movie looks cheap and probably is, it has the effect on you that it is achually real because o the camera quality , and if Hollywood had made the movie from scratch it would not have the same effect on people as this one does! this movie starts off as 3 young film makers heading into the burkitsville forest to make a documentary on a legend called the Blair witch,but things don't turn out the way its supposed to. heather gets them lost in the woods and we see the 2 male characters turning on her which adds to the realism of the movie! by the end of the movie we feel allot of sympathy for the 2 remaining characters as they are lost in the woods with a witch stalking and watching their every move and also a missing friend!! the end of the movie is one to wait for as it is really achually terrifying even though there are no 'pop-outs' or ghosts or even witches it is just the sense that you know something is going to happen and although the very end could have done with a little more imagination it is still very frightening at the same time!! as i say i was not part of the generation to have grown up with this movie as i am only 15 but i would strongly recommend this movie to absolutely everyone as this movie although didn't have a huge budget like the movies nowadays it has a lasting effect on you that all the money in Hollywood cannot buy!!",9,1,3,20 November 2010
