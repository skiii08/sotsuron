It," This is It
","As a big fan of Stephen King, and in love with the original series, I had high expectations when I saw this movie yesterday. When Pennywise said Hello down from the sewers, I was stuck! I've read that some people thought the movie boring, and not scary enough. But I was just glad that they mostly skipped jump scares, because IT is more then cheap scares. And this remake really captured the true nature of Pennywise the Dancing clown! This movie stayed true to the original and to Stephen King, and made sure that the characters was well played. Also, the actors did a fantastic job! And even if Tim Curry was my first Pennywise, Bill Skarsg√•rd makes a bloody brilliant version. So, if you've not seen the original series, read the book, don't know of how Stephen King works and just want jump scares then this might not be for you. But this movie is really good, and you'll float to if you just give it a chance.",9,4,8,18 September 2017
