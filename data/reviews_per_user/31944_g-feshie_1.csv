Moneyball," You need to understand baseball to understand this film
","Dull. Slow. Shallow. If you have watched a baseball game then this might be a half way decent film. But then who, outside the US ever watches this game? Moneyball is a highly detailed, tedious slice of baseball history, 'Moneyball' will appeal only to sports aficionados and those who understand the rules and trivia concerning this obscure North American sport. This is the true story of how a manager met the challenge of a small budget and beat the odds, but that fails to draw the casual viewer into the film. Three of us sat down to watch this film lured by the quality of the cast and all of us ran out of steam. We simply did not care how it ended and the last ten minutes of the film became a discussion of its shortcomings. If you happen to be a baseball 'trainspotter' then take the risk of investing an evening in this film. Othewise, don't waste your time",3,5,8,1 August 2012
