The Mask," The Mask we all want to have some time
","Great fantasy comedy.Jim Carrey makes use of all possible grins to give life to one of the characters she has given birth raunchy film.While the plot does not offer any real originality about situations in which Carrey is possessed by the Mask supplement any deficiency, that is, in this film, so spectacular and fun that result.Peter Green as convincing villain role, but you are missing something over black humor on their part and Cameron Diaz, newcomer at the time, it is sexy and funny.Adult tone that marks the whole film is much appreciated, as The Mask is no way a child character, in fact who has read the original comic know that this is a much darker and violent paint him as a character in the film and was subsequently in the animated series just a year later.The character itself, is fascinating. It represents the hidden fantasies of each of us and we possess powers that make us physically invincible, resilient, immune to bullets, superhuman speed and strength and freedom to do whatever we want, without fear of reprisal or police rules state etc ... in a nutshell winners, a world where we do not close the doors of the best club in town for being a nobody like the good Ipkiss, having the most hot girl, the best table, spread tickets like candy at a Christmas parade, in short, be the mambo Kings, as they say.The visual effects, even today are still very good, being deservedly nominated for an Oscar and other awards in that category.It also highlights the very successful and catchy songs like Coco Bongo Pachuco ¨ or ¨ Cuban Pete, police soundtrack.Nothing more to say about a film that won her debut year and has already become a cult film and fondly remembered for those lucky enough to live intensely the last decade of the 90s.",7,0,0,14 November 2014
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Pirates of the Caribbean or The Adventures of Jack Sparrow?
","Well, here we have the fourth Pirates of the Caribbean and said by the way, the worst of all. I am a true fan of this series, but I can not defend this disaster sequel too. After the original trilogy, and now turn to independent adventures of Jack Sparrow. Orlando Bloom is not. Well, I do not dislike the character and the actor, but neither will get to have really missed. Keira Knightley is not. Well sorry, but at this if I miss a lot. For me this girl is immensely more beautiful, sweet and best actress Penelope Cruz very overrated. The original crew, except Mr. Gibbs, disappears along with the Black Pearl. Neither Mr. Cotton, and the sympathetic bald dwarf, or those two pirates with you were your initial case in the three movies, nothing. So we find in this new film? Johny Deep as Jack Sparrow if he returns. Well, unsurprisingly, not the movie directly there. Keep up a good performance and is once again the best of the film, as it should be. Geoffrey Rush. Essential. This character really should not be missing in any sequel because with Deep, who is unable to start more laughter and sympathy among the public. May this great actor last and last to delight us with his talent. Penelope Cruz. No disappoints. The truth is that their performance is quite correct. What I do not understand is why his character seems at first that you will have an important role and then be slowly reduced. Her character is interesting and half the writers have failed to draw with too much confidence. Ian Mcshane. Disappointing. So clear. I was expecting a really scary and imposing Blackbeard but has not. The dubbing is terrible to start putting a ridiculous voice that did not hit anything with the character. Then there is the performance Mcshane, great actor by the way, just as he convinces that scenes, while others are low intensity seen on their part. Davy Jones was cool in every scene and every sentence he said, was memorable, but this does not convince really terrified. Very disappointing. Kevin McNally as Mr. Gibbs. I must say that this character is the prettiest and funniest of the series, and for me it has become imperative. I hope to continue in the following parts. The other actors are largely untapped. Uncle Vernon in Harry Potter appears as King George, only very briefly, in spite of being quite comical. completely wasted. The legendary Judi Dench only makes a cameo, so there's nothing to say. Oscar Jaenada only appears briefly at the beginning and end, as the Spanish ¨ ¨ without much to say the truth. Keith Richards is also very sporadic although it irremediably sympathetic dad Jackie. The film as a whole? For very loose truth. Nothing impresses nor really surprised, sometimes it is boring and uninteresting, and only wins when Deep Rush and appear together on screen. The subplot between the missionary and the mermaid is revolting and not interested or god. The sequences in Blackbeard's ship look promising, but ultimately nothing happens remarkable, except a fight shot with very little skill. Rob Marshall is not a bad director, but has failed to make us forget Gore Verbinski, especially its lack of energy when providing strength, humor and interest to the film, something not seen in previous. Interestingly photography becomes as in the first, bright and colorful, leaving aside the greyness and more off of the two sequels. The soundtrack becomes the same, with additions of Spanish guitar. Finally, a fourth part, which I was quite disappointed, despite having a good start, and more or less correct outcome, lacks true epic visual spectacle as were his predecessors, and the lack of previous cast members make it less attractive to the viewer. A sequel that's actually not such, but a spin-off of Jack Sparrow for the moment has not convinced me or fun as I expected. We will have to wait for the fifth, ¨ Dead Men Tell Tales ¨, to see if this was just a little bump unimportant, or notice of an inevitable decline. I really hope it's the former. Thank you.",6,0,0,19 July 2014
Ghost," Love transcends death
","Movie intelligently mixing fantasy with romantic drama.The couple Swayze-Moore exudes a warm and excellent chemical being especially famous scenes in which the two merge their hands to the sound of the legendary song 'unchained melody'.Woopi Goldberg uses his great qualities as a comedian to achieve likable down to viewers, being a lovable character and hard to forget.Surely the great merit of Ghost is the mix some different genres, but none comes annul the other, although it remains a highly dramatic film but it tastes good moments interspersed with humor and fanciful creating an atmosphere of pessimism, despair and turn hope.A really nice and sweet film, as tragic and funny at the same time.Recommended.",7,2,3,14 November 2014
Raiders of the Lost Ark," A search of the lost ark
","Absolute masterpiece of adventure movies. Lucas and Spielberg created from nothing to a character who has become an icon and stereotype adventurer hero, hat, whip and stir, being copied and imitated ad satiety, but never matched with the same magnificence that we saw in this film. And that is because Harrison Ford was able to give the character of all his charisma with that air of seductive and mischievous style of his other immortal character, Han Solo As Han Solo, and Jones is brave, but never cast behind your reasoning says otherwise, seductive, slaughtered and prepared to fight and die for what you believe. Spielberg, young, talented and with all the energy of which he was capable, he gave us an example of how to tell an affair with a mastery of time and fast-paced, with a nerve in the action scenes, especially the persecution, worthy of a teacher, and above all, with a sense of the sublime and great show, never missing the touches of humor that has always characterized all the films in the series. The side are all wonderful, and hard to forget, the lovely Marion Ravenwood, Sallah good-natured and friendly, the magnificent villain Toth Nazi spy, played perfectly by Ronald Lacey, the best I've seen on film, without forgetting Marcus, captain Katanga, the late Satipo ...... well, all unforgettable. With an argument of Lucas himself and exquisite production design by Norman Reynolds, is one of the best movie sagas and history, Lucas finally wrote his name with golden letters in the industry, as creative genius, as he had cast before his War Galaxies while Spielberg made ​​it clear who was the new king Midas of Hollywood. Artwork, which will spend more than the years but never ages like fine wine, better yet known. To your health!!",9,2,5,19 July 2014
The Terminator," Are you waiting for?
","A legendary title simply repeat, legendary . Terminator is and will always be one of my favorite movies of all time.The story is just great and heartbreaking . That apocalyptic world devastated and dominated and destroyed by the machines even today continues scaring great time.That impossible to escape from the main characters of that brutal and merciless machine , played by a monstrous, absolutely brilliant Schwarzenegger keeps you glued to the screen in a total state of tension.This is because as Kyle Reese says the Terminator can not talk, is a killing machine , no pain , no fear, no remorse, will never end . spoiler In my memory it has been forever etched scenes assault the Terminator to the police station , where fatal effectiveness brushing each and every one of the cops , as Kyle says , do not preclude a machine made to exterminate crosses who in their way.This, my friends, is a classic, a great movie , A TEACHER ! WORK !Are you still reading ? Are you waiting for ? Wear it but now!!",10,3,5,23 May 2014
Avengers: Age of Ultron," More of the same
","Well, first I say that neither I nor detractor follower Los ¨ Vengers, but I've seen both films as mere amateur ¨ Some comics and superhero films in order to spend time entertainment and escape.The first film, so exalted and deified ¨ can be said for most of the globe I found it an acceptable, entertaining film in perspective but quite cold and leaden in many cases, and superheroes, I confess, are not really saints my devotion, Thor, Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk etc .... I have always been other heroes and adults darker Batman, Spawn or Conan among others ..., so see the Avengers in feel much enthusiasm or feeling by its protagonists.Analyze this film really is not very difficult as its premise, and development situations is almost identical to its predecessor. The same words, same performances caught by the hair, except to Downey Junior Achiever always a fun and refreshing and Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye, the rest as I said is correct and left in little more, and Samuel L. Jackson wears me I tired a lot.Whedon address? Mediocre. I said and say again, this saga, because it will become a saga lose much with this useless manager, that manager has very, very little experience and trade. And it Wheddon is unable to provide true intensity and force the stories, the action scenes or performances, all are equally cold and pain in the ass than the previous, which is worth much fx and such, but again the same, not kill, not impressed, nothing, everything is already past the ending as you stay at first. Nothing memorable or do you plan to open the mouth! Wow that last! , Or joke. Epic failure, real emotion. Whedon does not work, and I hope they deviate to one side, but given the commercial success of both films, I see almost impossible.The villain Ultron, it sucks. I find it pathetic, ridiculous and uninteresting, and the final battle as it was predictable, a succession of leaps, explosions, falls, blows, pithy phrases and graciosillas and little ... little more.Certainly they give it a slightly darker tone than before, and in regard to rhythm, this is better off, being less lighter in his diálogos, which is appreciated, and after all entertain, entertaining, but that is the end all, not innovate or offer anything new, the script repeats the above schemes, misses a great epic and emotional level, the direction of Whedon still own a television film, taking away many points to the film, and Fx .. sí I repeat myself, I think I already know what he would say no?As a sequel that's fine, as movie is better than the first, but we must find a director with real talent, give a more dark and violent film pitch, a script with more guts and not go to the topic and easy, and maybe it can be considered truly an awesome movie to the next installment.Thank you.",5,8,18,2 June 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," Wacky Madnees on Wheels
","Both good and bad.That's how I define this Remake.The film is visually a joy, it can not be denied. His photography, staging, installation, chase sequences are shot with force and showmanship by George Miller, no doubt its commitment to offer adrenalin pace and tone really delusional, crazy and wild.But in counterpoint I have to say that history is guilty of being extremely simple, he says pointless.The film itself is silent. A succession of stunts, explosions amid a deafening noise, but here it's all over, there is no real storytelling, a sense of adventure, emotion is as if they had been too afraid to be sliced ​​head with an original story, some witty dialog and situations that really impact, no, the whole film is a continuous evolution of sterile action, the end usual with the dead and the living and bad heroes end. Not that I seek a philosophical film not a melodrama or anything like that, but at least a story to tell me something, I could get involved with the characters or with which they could identify, but has not been well, everything is pure artifice, circus show for the masses. A film seeking our approval with blows of effect, as if to hypnotize us with their action tirelessly to not see the disturbingly empty content that really treasures.The performances ? Charlize Theron is notable for its makeover but his performance is all horrible, poor lighting, with little charisma and strength. Tom Hardy is a flat actor head to toe, is cold and not transmitting anything, and certainly not reach wing Gibson and soles of shoes.But I can not stop this new Mad Max. Because the truth is that his delusional and crazy visual style of futuristic western, his furious and wild rhythm, well shot action gets my approval, a very entertaining and estimable B series, but nowhere near the I consider, as they are already doing hundreds , a work of art.No way.But I like it, mind you.",6,3,10,2 June 2015
