Ford v Ferrari," Loved every bit of it
","Funny Wenn needed sad and Hart felt Wenn needed and good sound and crashes, ackting from baile and mat was awesome including bailes voice acting was definitely worth the watch",10,1,3,30 December 2019
Midway," This is not just a copy of the original but a little improvement
","Storytelling is good, casting was outstanding and very fitting to the original people, the movie was definitely better than that pearl harbor movie don't get me wrong menny explosions but just about acceptable, the only thing that was missing to me was the connection to the ships themselves and sometimes hard to tell what ships were in the seen could of done with names, this was definitely more a aviation movie than involving ships/aircraft carriers but that's all I can fault it for besides that as a war movie it's definitely a good watch",9,0,0,4 February 2020
