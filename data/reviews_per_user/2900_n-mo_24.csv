Skyfall," If this is modernity, count me out.
","Part of the appeal of the original James Bond, as conceived by Ian Fleming and as depicted in all 007 films up to 'Licence to Kill,' is the way in which it plays to a sort of quirky imperial British nationalistic chauvinism in its twilight but kept alive and polite by the fact that the successor Great Power was a descendant of England (the United States - more on this later) embroiled in a nasty griplock with one of the most horrific superpowers ever seen (Ronald Reagan may have been a cretin, but unless you're a member of the French Communist Party, which famously reacted to news of the Gulag Archipelago by ignoring it and precipitating its own decline, you must admit his speechwriters certainly got the 'evil empire' bit right on the money) - and to a sort of male chauvinism very peculiar to Britain. N.B.: Indiana Jones played on post-war American optimism and nationalist chauvinism in much the same way.However, owing to cultural changes, 'Skyfall' could never have lived up to the best ambiance of the 007 franchise, and the filmmakers' attempts to juice it up with modern meaning only serve to hasten the day of reckoning.As the 1990s unrolled, overt sophisticated jingoism became increasingly less acceptable in the eyes of polite educated company, and the memory of the Hays Code was distant enough that directors need not fear slipping subversive undertones into their films, provided they steered clear of anything that would too overtly offend most of the inattentive box office-goers whose pockets they yearned to empty. Hence 'Goldeneye' could only make it to the box office if it were to be touted the 'modernization' of the James Bond movies (replete with hammer-and-sickle symbolism neatly planted into the opening credits of a film in which the protagonist is supposedly anti-communist and a feminist dressing-down of said protagonist), and the newest Indiana Jones movie couldn't depict an anti-communist protagonist without showing that a capitalist was just as bad.And since 'Goldeneye,' the 007-series has been well unrecognizable. For if the quirky British and male-chauvinist bent of the old Bond films has a kind of quaint charm as an historical relic that excuses 'sophisticated' folk for taking guilty pleasure in them, even a rabid reactionary, if honest, would concede that a similar ambiance could not today be captured on film, at least not in any contemporary setting. It's not just that it would be offensive (and to the professional victim class, it would be), or that it wouldn't be plausible (Bond stories have never had a problem dispensing with the limits of plausibility): it would be completely out of order and cheesily laughable.Arguably, the wise thing to do would have been to throw in the towel and stop creating new installments for a fictional universe which can no longer proceed from the order of things in Britain or the world. But the 007 franchise was too hot to give its last gasp without cashing in, and so the producers castrated it. All of the quirky charm of Old Britain, with all of its flaws and all of its dignity, is gone. What's left is bloodshed and high-paced action. The problem is that bloodshed and high-paced action are each a dime a dozen in cinema. Accordingly, all Bond films since and including 'Goldeneye' were predictably bland and boring.The producers of 'Skyfall' surely understood this, for they decided to turn the formula around and 'deconstruct' the classic Bond: giving him emotion, injecting anguish over the deaths of his parents, turning the 'Bond Girl' fixation into a weird and stupid and possibly depian mommy-attachment, even hinting at homo-eroticism beneath that aggressive womanizing. Some have praised this turn of events for the literary and cinematic richness it breaths to the film and, by extension, to the script.Please allow me to respectfully dissent, on the following grounds:'Deconstructionists' are notorious for taking superficial things and turning them into objects of contemplation. In France there is a well-known psychiatrist who wrote a psychoanalysis of the child's love for a McDonald's hamburger as surrogate breast-food. The bottom line is that James Bond is silly and superficial and just a quirky, personal-fantastic guilty pleasure: while the better-crafted of the novels and classic films certainly showcase a few fun-to-contemplate aspects of culture and the world, they are pure entertainment and have absolutely no didactic value, not even incidentally, not even as libertine works. There is absolutely no fun in seeing them deconstructed, and if one is cone-headed enough to take the the deconstruction seriously, one risks having all the previous films retroactively ruined as well.In the end, the Bond universe is such that anything that aspires to be anything other than simply entertaining is doomed to abject failure. These ridiculous subtexts are so obviously retrofitted onto the character and setting that one is tempted to see this film as a parody of deconstructionism.But it gets worse. Because the film is so fixated on its the uninteresting and unamusing themes, it fails to advance a sympathetic or conceivable plot. Nothing makes sense; nothing is put together; no progression can be seen - and so throughout the action scenes that so ungracefully intersperse the postmodern drawl, one cannot feel that sort of breathless tension. One is simply not able to make oneself care.See 'The Hangover part 3' for another example of a recent movie that cut the guts out of a purely entertaining universe to try and tried to inject conscious meaning. This has not been a good season for big-name film franchises. Indeed, one might suspect that even the name 'deconstruction' is, minus the '-con-,' a harbinger for the future of a civilization which insists upon tearing all its own treasures, even the silly trinkets such as James Bond or The Hangover, to bits. Be old-fashioned. Save your money and rent the old flicks.",3,6,14,25 June 2013
Ghost," Worth a good try
","There are many movies which deal with death and the afterlife. The problem with most of them is that their unwillingness to respect any established boundaries of moral theology ungrounds the entire universe and leaves a product that is unhuman.'Ghost' does not make that mistake. Although the metaphysics are clearly fantastical, we can suspend disbelief, because it is quite clear throughout that love and good works are the path to salvation, while hatred and evil deeds are the path to damnation. While there is no overt religious iconography, there are still a few satisfying if amorphous suggestive elements that a discerning eye can easily connect to formal religious doctrine.Whoopi Goldberg's Oda Mae is often written off as just another 'Magical Negro' trope. It is true that hers is a black supporting character whose role in the primary plot is to expedite, through (highly) extraordinary means, the resolution of the white protagonists' conflict. However, Oda Mae is a far more interesting character than either Sam or Molly, both in personality and in backstory, and is also, unlike Sam and Molly, dynamic: along the way to getting them out of their glut, she is forced to confront her rotten past as a charlatan and turn her life around. There is a partial inversion of the trope here, for it is the undeveloped, static and almost supernaturally angelic Sam who ends up leading the formerly banally criminal Oda Mae to salvation, and she repays him by helping to save Molly, the woman he loves.Although, it's not entirely clear that Sam was actually meant to be so bland, and indeed, if you're watching the movie looking for personal inspiration, he and Molly might not be the best in terms of making an emotional connection. It's clear that they love each other very deeply, and for many people that may well be enough to make an emotional connection. I would have liked a little something more, but then, I've never tried to watch this as a date movie. At the least, your girlfriend won't suspect you only wanted to watch it for the incredible special effects, which do not exist. Have fun!",7,1,2,10 June 2013
The Godfather: Part II," The least-good of the bunch, but still good.
","It pains me to give any installment of The Goldfather' only 8 out of 10. The trilogy is definitely one of my leitmotifs and I rewatch all three about every six months or so. Nevertheless, Part II is probably the least enjoyable to watch, though I would never skip over it.Why exactly is this? The acting is superb; the cinematography is great; thematically, the film furthers and develops all the notes hit in the first. Nevertheless, the story, while 'good' such as it is, it doesn't quite deliver the gripping goods of the first. The backstory of erstwhile Godfather Vito Corleone and the development of his career was worth telling and artistically interesting to contrast with Michael's own headship of the family. Interspersing the two as the editors did may or may not have been a great choice, as it arguably cuts into the building tension of the younger Don's journey.Still, it's not clear that that journey would, uninterrupted, have made for a gripping drama on par with that of Part I. The first doled out a lot of lavish character development and courtly intrigue with just the right amount of shocking action punctuated in. Whatever the inaccuracies with respect to the real-world mafia, the first certainly captured the dynamic of real-world diplomacy and warfare (whether conventional or criminal) in bouts of rising pressure and preparation sometimes - usually with little of any warning - giving way to open battle. There isn't a ton of action in this one, certainly not on the level of the first.Still, it makes for a good evening. I tend nowadays to be doing chores when I have it on - I've seen it often enough - but it's not unpleasant to watch and as with the first there is always a lot of 'new' stuff to catch or forgotten stuff to rediscover upon rewatch. These are big, dense films, and should leave the real aficionados satisfies in any event.",8,1,1,24 December 2019
10 Things I Hate About You," If there's a way to hackney Shakespeare...
","Any movie that uses as its base such strong source material as a William Shakespeare play can't be completely written off. Still, while 10 Things I Hate about You followed the heels of Clueless in adapting popular classic fiction to the then-flagging teen/chick genre, it ultimately sputtered on poor writing and sloppy characterisation so that anyone sophisticated enough to appreciate its literary heritage will moan and groan at the paradoxical plot headaches.First of all, I really have to suspend disbelief to imagine that an OB-GYN like Dr. Stratford who, after seeing too many teenage pregnancies and being left to raise his two children all alone, is so tightly-wound as not to let his daughters date until they graduate, would continue sending them to a coeducational school, much less a *public* school where the 'same little ***wipes'-****-for-brains' roams every hallway, in the words of Padua High's own guidance counselor.Second, while it is hard to complain about seeing Julia Stiles and Larisa Oleynik for a couple of hours, their characters really needed more than this script gave them. All of the characters are written up verbally to add a bit of Elizabethan flavour, and Stiles' Katerina is portrayed as a rebel against meaningless pop-consumer culture and seeking a more nuanced intellectual path... yet at the end she turns out a poem that reads like something I wrote at age fifteen. She plays herself up as so much more mature than her classmates and she's going to school on the opposite coast in a few months, yet even after she discovers she's been set up to fulfill her ex-lover's Playboy fantasies with her sister, she slides almost immediately back into a relationship with a willfully complicit boyfriend she'll probably never see again. This was so perfectly satired, by the way, at the end of Not Another Teen Movie.And, hey, the original ending of The Taming of the Shrew showed Katherina coming to terms with convention--but on a more profound level than the ordinary wife. She submitted to her husband because he subjected himself to her torments. But the play never condemned traditional society, whereas the film's parallel 'convention,' teenage smarm culture, is expressly condemned throughout the movie, by Katarina and others, and yet it's vindicated by the end.The development of her sister Bianca is equally fragmented. She falls in love with the 'good guy,' Cameron, long before Katarina's lecture on the terrible truth of her former hotrod, Joey. So what does she have to learn from her sister? Does she even learn anything at all? What didn't she know to begin with? Even at that point, she's still sitting in her room pining away for the prom in front of MTV. (And wouldn't an uptight, frustrated, paranoid OB-GYN cut the cable, as well? I know I sure would...)How pitiful. HOWEVER... when all is said and done, it *is* a modern adaptation of a Shakespeare play, it's one of the films where Heath Ledger's presence does not elicit disgust, and the occasional spitball hurled at contemporary teenage life is indescribably amusing. So, too, is guidance counselor Ms. Perky (at whose indiscretions I ought not amuse myself, but I can't help it). How many public school teachers not-so-secretly want that, I wonder? It's not quite as stylish or subtle as it sometimes thinks itself, but it has its moments. Don't expect Shakespeare, though.",5,4,8,15 April 2008
American Beauty," Spielberg and company go to the art-house
","Ever since the relentless suburbanization of America in the post-world war era, a solid indictment of its banality, escapism, hypocrisy, wastefulness, artificiality, effeminacy, and ultimate futility has been long overdue. Sadly, this film is not that indictment. (Critics of suburbia have abounded, but largely from a left-libertine standpoint. This is ironic, given that suburbanites are as likely to include aging hippie university professors as culturally indifferent white-collar professionals.)It is not surprising that Steven Spielberg, probably the most overrated and undeservedly successful filmmaker alive, would have hand-picked this film and its director. A socially critical art-house flick was clearly beyond the abilities of the whole trio, but then, Hollywood has always been more about egos than talent.Sure enough, Alan Ball and Sam Mendes fall into the same sort of stereotyping, clichés, and flat, off-the-mark storytelling as Spielberg himself. Dysfunctional suburban couples do indeed abound, but from my experience, more often than not suburbanites do not take marriage seriously enough not to divorce over petty niceties. And do we really need another film in which the homophobic alpha male is secretly harboring same-sex tendencies?Ultimately, too, the ending negates any depiction of suburban life is inherently harmful to its adherents, choosing as it does to depict a family destroyed by outside force rather than its own internal stupidity. The nod toward sophistication is clearly a mere nod. Steve, my lad, let's go back to Jurassic Park, shall we?",3,1,4,16 August 2007
Enchanted," Insipid meets cynical
","'Enchanted' is a parody in the true sense of the word. Too many parodies these days ruin the fun with either mocking or filth (see 'Scary Movie'), but 'Enchanted' works because it stays true to the Disney fairy tale genre while exposing said genre's more ridiculous edges to the harsh reality of life in that physically and psychologically roughest of world cities, New York. It tells us that, as any adult knows, real life is nothing like a Disney movie, but even at their most insipidly idyllic moments, they can provide just enough brightness to lift our spirits.And in maintaining the integrity of the genre it satirizes, 'Enchanted' turns out some amazingly strong characters (including, surprisingly, Pip the chipmunk). In a weaker take, a spoofed Disney Princess could easily be some stupid, slutty bimbo, but Amy Adams's Giselle is genuinely deep and good-hearted. Her idyllic nature is tested in a hostile environment, and she never loses her sweetness or musicality. She's an inspiration, and a beautiful thing to behold for single guys like me.So naturally I sympathized with Patrick Dempsey's Robert. He's straight-laced, hard-working, caring of his daughter Morgan--and rather cynical. He does his best to steer Morgan away from the world of fantasy-princess literature that would give her unrealistic hopes--and just when they needs it the most, this family is jerked out of his bleak pessimism and finds a world of sweetness and light.'Enchanted' is more than a satire of or tribute to the fairy-tale genre. It is a statement about idealism versus realism, optimism versus pessimism, naïveté versus cynicism. The real world is neither ideal nor hell; the real world is harsh but there is hope for the future; and neither Pollyanna's curiosity nor the pride of knowing too much will move us forward. 'Enchanted' is about Giselle and Robert moving from these laughable extremes, so characteristic of most Hollywood cinema, to a happy equilibrium, a much-welcomed respite.I have scarcely touched on the visuals--computer animation is by now completely non-offensive and the film takes full advantage of this. So, too, do they capture the very best neo-Gothic and Classical architecture in New York City. The whole film is eye candy, an all-around inspiration.",8,1,2,22 December 2007
Gone with the Wind," Gone with the Wind moments
","A dear friend of mine said she'd definitely had a few of those during her sojourn in Atlanta, but frankly, you don't need to go all the way there to understand what that means. 'Gone with the Wind' is a film about life: heaven and hell, heroes and villains, rich and poor, authority and obedience, love and hatred, civilisation and barbarism. Some deny that distinctions exist or ought to exist; others believe steadfastly that they are always on one side or the other, but as Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn knew, and as 'Gone with the Wind' shows, there is indeed a line and it oscillates not between humans but within every human heart.Some, like the foreman, choose to eclipse any light totally in this world before going to hell, indulging without heed in vice and avarice. Some, like Melanie, conscientiously shine as brightly as possible, aware of their own weaknesses and working with them. Then there is every level in between: Belle, who lives in the dark but admires and even longs for the light that she can't bring herself to reach out and take; Ashley, who lives in the light and loves it passionately but whose sensibility allows him to tiptoe indulgently into the darkness...... and, of course, Scarlet and Rhett, who strike the balance. Of course, the difference is that Scarlet will not come to terms with what she is, for that would force her to change. Rhett confesses his dark side openly and thinks it a necessary sacrifice... but one he hopes to overcome, some way, somehow.But it is the setting of 'Gone with the Wind,' in a civilisation in peril, that is essential to the understanding of the entire film. The balance of civilisation versus barbarism is the windpipe upon which this entire piece is tuned. One cannot appreciate 'Gone with the Wind' without having tasted true civilisation, and so I fear its popularity may decline if my generation of Americans continues living in stifling, bland suburbs, never petting a real horse, seeing truly decorative art outside a museum or hearing liturgical music in a real Church--and insulating itself whenever it comes close to (the remnants of) a civilisation, and if Europe continues to sell itself to Americanist infatuations (which it has recommenced in vigour since the end of last year).Those of us who intend to preserve some sort of civilisation, however, can only love 'Gone with the Wind,' and can only speak of its strengths.",10,2,4,29 July 2009
The Illusionist," The Pretentionist
","My friend Rob asked me to tell him about the film The Illusionist. I answered that I was quite impressed by the way those Viennese spoke perfect English throughout the whole movie. He concurred with my frustration: 'Plausibility is a major problem for me with a lot of movies.' Obviously not every movie requires plausibility to work, but The Illusionist, wants us to take it far too seriously to allow such suspension of disbelief.Set in the last decades of the splintering Austro-Hungarian Empire, this film tells the story of Eisenheim, a talented magician who is in love with his childhood friend Sophie, destined to become by marriage Kronprinzessin über Österreich-Ungarn. (I used more High German in that last sentence than any character during the two hours of the film.) Actually, they were in love since childhood, but her parents objected, being as she was an aristocrat in love with a peasant.Sound familiar? One thinks of The Princess Bride, The Notebook, Titanic, or any other tale of forbidden cross-class love. One would think we got the point by now. But The Princess Bride had a sort of romantic wholesomeness about it, The Notebook had provincial New World charm and a nice twist and even Titanic at least boasted a fun setting and a host of impressive visual effects. The Illusionist tries to emulate some of that but fails miserably. If the story of Titanic was wanting in believability, the very setting of The Illusionist is mentally insulting. The costumes are good and the special effects are fun but there is no flashy cinematography showing off the splendor of the Empire.Indeed, one would scarcely be aware that this is Imperial Austria we are dealing with if it weren't for the subplot of Kronprinz Leopoldan abusive alcoholic woman-beaterhatching a plot to overthrow his father with the help of his fiancée. (Regarding the writers' treatment of this man, enough has been said by other and better reviewers such as Erik Gloor. I shall let the dry disconnect of my style speak for itself.) Leopold grows to hate Eisenheim one night after the magician gives him a spin of anxiety during a magic trick and his animosity is, needless to say, not helped by the discovery that his fiancée is sleeping with the man. Then when Sophie attempts to leave him, we see her riding out of his country estate on a horse limp and blood-stained. At this point we began to wonder if perhaps the writers did have some spunkthey actually killed the girl, and with a whole hour left! Alas, it is not to be.There is a rather sketchy anti-monarchical undertone about this movie, difficult to articulate due to its incoherence, but we can be sure it's there. Some readers will take objection to my criticism on the grounds that this was not the main theme of the movie, which is true, but the creators took that theme far enough to warrant critical examination of their treatment. As in Titanic and The Notebook, we are supposed to be outraged because the aristocratic classes possess a sort of unwarranted snobbery acting as the main obstacle to our protagonists' heartfelt ambitions (yawn), but while those films simply played off the concept of class segregation, The Illusionist actually makes statements against aristocracy but at best halfhearted attempts at continuity and consistency from layer to layer. When the magician attempts to prove that Leopold murdered his lover and is a traitor to his father, the chief of police advises him that he 'cannot bring down the monarchy.' (By exposing a traitor to the crown? Maybe there's some sort of irony here, but to me it's plain stupid.)It gets worse. When the magician's tricks turn to apparent divination, the humanists hail the end to this horrible period of scientific rationalism and the ushering in of a new 'spiritual republic' to replace the old empirethe writers assuming, quite rightly, that an American audience would miss the ironic stupidity. (Rationalism and materialism likened to a Catholic monarchy? I doubt it.) And then they subsequently undermine their repudiation of monarchy when Eisenheim later advises his loyal followers that his spectacles are indeed mere tricks and not truly spiritual experiences, which should impart upon us that it would be wrong to follow the spiritual path to the enlightened republic. So what was the point of showing the humanists' lightweight oration? Putting the story in context clearly went out the window long ago.But they don't stop there. At the end it becomes clear how much they take our gullibility for granted. The Kronprinz, his conspiracy exposed by his man-in-arms the Chief of Police and standing accused of murder, shoots himself. Then the Chief realizes via a hint that the death of Sophie wassurprise!yet another illusion on the part of the great Eisenheim! And we finish with our magician riding off to the countryside, where his loverregrettably, very much not deadhas traded the tasteful gowns she ported throughout the movie for a nice pair of riding pants. Women's liberation! Freedom and democracy! Down with Danubian tyranny! What exactly is the message here? That the virtues of liberation can be attained by deliberately implicating a man in a crime that never took place? Why should we desire to attain such liberation? More fundamentally, why should we have any sympathy with these most disingenuous protagonists?What we have here is a hypocritically moralizing tome set against an Anglophone Habsburg Empire. The stage entertainment is amusing, but you're definitely better off investing in tickets to an actual magic show. The real illusion in The Illusionist stems not from the magic tricks, but from the fact that, like Titanic, it looks historical and classy and so dupes its audience into believing they are taking part in something highly culturedonly in this case, there is no effective recapturing even in part of either history or class. It's so pretentious and implausible that even its pretension strains plausibility.",1,33,73,8 September 2006
Million Dollar Baby," I know so many have said this before, but... WHY is there not a ZERO on IMDb??!!
","Between 'Million Dollar Baby' and 'The Sea Inside,' the 2004 Oscars were really giving the euthanasia theme a run for its money. All the same, it would be wrong to label 'Million Dollar Baby' as euthanasia propaganda. For one thing, it cannot hold a candle to 'The Sea Inside,' a film which, as disgusting as it may have been morally, accomplished its mission much more elegantly on both a literal level (characters, plot, cinematography, direction/acting) and a figurative level (politics, left-wing: euthanasia). I don't know why, but Latin filmmakers just seem so much more adept at weaving beautiful productions out of banal leftist tripe than are their Anglo counterparts (see 'Motorcycle Diaries' versus 'The Wind That Shakes the Barley' for a more explicitly Marxist example).Having said that, I don't believe that 'Million Dollar Baby' was even conceived as a 'pro-euthanasia' film. I know Clint Eastwood has had run-ins with disability organizations and perhaps his sense of humour is sick enough that he thought this a funny way of spitting in their faces. It is not, of course, a comedy on any level, and no one will laugh at any time during this film unless it be out of pity for poor Mr. Eastwood. Probably the only solid point in the movie is its lambasting of generations-removed Irish-Americans' obsession with 'the home country,' but even that is too heavy-handed to really be all that comic.Let's start with Maggie. Hilary Swank, who was terrific as the bimbo Kimberly in 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' (the good one; i.e., the movie, not the show), can never be anything but annoying, and therefore ruins any character we are supposed to take seriously. However, the character of Maggie is also annoying AS WRITTEN—now, mind you, this would be fine if this were intentional and comic, but it is not. Eastwood actually seems to expect us to take Maggie seriously. Or does he? Perhaps Eastwood, like me, finds the idea that some sweet-little 32-year-old trailer-park child would become a world-class boxer absolutely ludicrous. Perhaps, then, the more overtly ridiculous scenes with Maggie's family weren't so out of place. Perhaps there is real comedy in the fact that all the critics and Oscar voters actually took this seriously—and perhaps this comedy is what Eastwood wanted all along.The same could be said of Frankie. Tormented by the mountain of returned unopened letters he sends to his daughter, he babies poor little Maggie as though she were his own Karate Action Barbie doll and, when she's had enough of everything in life, struggles between granting this unrealistic poupée one truly uninspiring request and following the solid advice of an equally unrealistic priest. Once Frankie makes his decision, it is clear that he is unhappy with himself. So the movie actually makes no statement whatsoever about euthanasia or about the Catholic Church; the whole last 45 minutes are just a sort of farcical pornography of controversy. Idiotic critics and audiences just drool over this brand of emotional manipulation, thus explaining the obscene amount of cash raked in as well as the wholly undeserved Oscar.In all this, then, Eastwood shows himself to be as nihilistic as he did in 'Mystic River,' only that film actually had me convinced almost up until the ending and at least waited until then to collapse on itself and induce vomit from the viewers. 'Million Dollar Baby' is unbelievable from the very start. If you haven't yet seen it, may I suggest that you preserve your virgin eyes; there is nothing in here of value to the canon of cinema.",1,0,5,21 August 2010
Up," ... am I supposed to care?
","For the most part, Pixar films seem almost totally immune to criticism. I'm not really sure what it is, but Liam Colle might have given us a hint when he said of the studio's repertoire: 'These are not kids movies that parents can sit through. Pixar makes grown-up movies that parents don't feel guilty about letting their kids watch.' I think people think they're SUPPOSED to like them because of the 'cute' factor, and I also think that the 3-D animation ties into this.Because, let's face it: Disney animated classics such as 'Sleeping Beauty' would not have worked so well or at all with live actors. Neither would Pixar's. But Disney of old (and I insist well on this point!) could get away with the flashy, fantastical, imaginative storyboards precisely because the animation was beautiful and fluid. Pixar's is flat, sterile and robotic. The elements all look plastic. This is just part of the limitation of 3-D rendering. Sure, this worked for Toy Story, because all the characters WERE plastic toys.But stories about actual characters fall flat, because we simply can't relate to the characters. That leaves the cuteness and threadbare humor (if you are the sort who finds this stuff funny, and I am not) to sustain the film, and I have to opine that it is a really sad state of affairs when the adults of our society consider cuteness sufficient power for sustaining a dramatic narrative.Now for 'Up' itself. The beginning part is dreadfully depressing, and might work for a live-action art house film, but I can't imagine a child (again, this is NOT a kids' film, but it is marketed as such) sitting through it without crying. The second half of the movie leaves us with a grumpy old man and an incredibly annoying kid stuck in a tangle on an extraordinary adventure, trying to extricate themselves from a problem that the kid caused. There is no meaning, no feeling: just cuteness, if you aren't sufficiently annoyed by this point.'Up' really should have been two movies: one picturesque live-action film about the old man, with no extra-possible situations, and one plasticky CGI film about a random lonely old man and a kid. The latter would have been utterly ignorable but still would have garnered the praise of critics. And such a cleavage would have avoided the film we actually got, which was the latter with connotations of pretension toward the former, adding insult to injury.Pixar... just go away, please?",1,10,38,11 November 2013
Eyes Wide Shut," An excellent drunken date after-party
","Eyes Wide Shut is a bad movie, but not in the sense that you couldn't enjoy it in a kind of mystery science theater setting. I asked my buddy what on Earth had possessed him to buy this DVD, and he responded that his (now ex-)girlfriend had seen it in the store and that she had been curious to watch it. I responded that 'this DOES seem like a Walter and Fiona (names changed to protect the innocent) movie,' especially considering that girl was a mental headcase. (In fact, according to Walter, the conversation that punctuated a wildly funny scene of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman toking it up and fondling each other rather resembled his conversations with Fiona.)And that's just the thing about this type of film: if anyone actually thought this was amazing, he would probably not be the kind of person you would want to meet. But the sort of people who THINK they should like this belong to the bored, bland, postmodern American bourgeoisie so easily duped into believing that to watch decadent pictures set against beautiful Italianate and beaux-arts architecture and sprinkled with profanity will bring enlightenment and sophistication. There are few things more hilarious or entertaining than to watch American yuppies ape this shallow conception of European culture.To be sure, Eyes Wide Shut is stunningly filmed, though it was difficult for me to place the location at first. I was not surprised to learn subsequently that Stanley Kubrick filmed this on sets rather than the actual streets of New York. The outdoor shots clearly lack the requisite atmosphere--though perhaps that was done intentionally so as to convey the 'dreamy' sensibility so dwelt upon by fawning reviewers.Genuine or not, however, great cinematography cannot save this inordinately poorly written story. We are expected to believe that Cruise is so seriously traumatized by the discovery that his wife had fantasized about sleeping with another man (and had been relieved when he had left and removed the temptation) that he must go on a quest to understand the dark side of human sexuality. To the filmmakers' credit, they resist the temptation to make him give in to this darkness, which would have been all too easy in the era of moral nihilism. Still, this is a shaky premise at best, implying that for a physician, Cruise's character is terribly naïve about fleshly impulses.A similarly shoddy point deals with the antics of Kidman, who only dreams about what her husband witnesses. Awakened from her fit of laughter, she laments her horrifying nightmare where 'people were ****ing! And I was ****ing them! And I was making FUN of you!' But this is so stupid as to actually be quite enjoyable: I would like to know, was she crying because she was traumatized by the thought of betraying her husband, or because she awoke from a rather pleasant dream to see her beloved at her side? Cruise and Kidman are not known for their acting abilities, but when they get the chance to ham it up at these campy moments, which are littered throughout the script, they shine, and brighten the movie just that much more. The last line was an absolute hoot, and ironically, the only logical ending to this preposterous mess.One more aspect ought to be dealt with: the nudity. Even with the U.S. edits to pass for an 'R' rating, in my mind this still qualifies, quite easily, for NC-17. The gratuitousness of it all further dilutes and overwhelms what should have been Cruise's remarkable resistance to the subsuming forces of sexual deviance. Granting that it is difficult to depict a stylish, ritualized orgy, so central to this plot, without removing the actors' clothing, one has to question whether, if such drastic measures are necessary, there is really anything meaningful to say with this story (there is not). And the fact that this was one long in-your-face flesh fest from the opening act proves that it was meant to provoke and to 'be bad,' which is no longer that shocking by today's lowered standards. Neither is the whole premise of an exclusive, high-society sex cult really that outlandish--most conspiracy theories are false, of course, but I've heard enough sordid tales of the American élite to know that some must be true. A well-educated urbanite like Cruise shouldn't be so shocked.Apparently this is based on a late-nineteenth century Austrian novella, which I have not read. I'm not sure how it was in its own context--perhaps it was nothing more than provocation or perversion--but this version is irredeemably marred by sloppy writing and wanton pretension to seriousness. In response to the reviewer(s) who said, 'Be prepared to think!' I say, don't waste too many brain cells. The sheer volume of profanity, campiness and nudity precludes any possibility that a real human being could take this seriously, but watching Kubrick trip over himself to attain that end will produce no small amount of laughter. So just enjoy the guilty ride.",5,2,5,7 October 2007
Beauty and the Beast," How can anyone sit still in front of this senatorial assault?!
","This was the most hyped of Disney's live-action remakes thus far, and eventually I caved. Why not try it, at least? Sadly, I barely lasted a couple of minutes, for two reasons. The first one is that the sets look fake. Everything is grandiose, rococo, oversaturated, stiff and overly symmetrical and 'theoretical.' I can suspend such disbelief in a theatrical setting, but not on screen.The second reason, as you may have guessed, is Emma Watson. You can tick off the number of problems with her performance:<ul><li>She can't sing. She just CAN'T. She can carry a tune because she was taught to do so specifically for the film, but she has absolutely no natural musical talent, no seductive sweetness. No way could I listen to this for two hours.</li><li>There's no verisimilitude to her acting. She's overly expressive; her emotions are exaggerated; her accentuation is artificial. But it's not just her: pretty much everyone on screen has the same annoying affectation. Again, this might work if they were in the Broadway musical. It fails, here.</li><li>She doesn't exactly have a pretty face. Sorry to be superficial, but the title is 'BEAUTY and the Beast' and she's playing a character named 'Beauty.' There's *just* no excuse for this one.</li></ul>As one forum poster said shortly before the initial release, the concept was clearly to sell the public tickets to 'Come and see Hermione play Belle!' and it worked. She was clearly miscast, though, even for the Broadway musical, which everyone on screen seems to think they were playing in.I obviously can't comment on the actual dramatic storyline (though I did catch glimpses of obvious anachronisms such as black peasant girls alongside white counterparts in 17th-century France) but from what I've heard it's an (overly) 'extended' version of the 1991 animated film, which for all its faults was at least highly entertaining. If they had focused on replicating the original story in live-action without any addendums they might have thought to pay attention to casting and directing. It wouldn't have been easy to reproduce the whimsical idiosyncratic fun of a musical project now so widely known, but with appropriate talent and enough willpower it shouldn't have been impossible, either.As it is they seem to have been determined to create something so grandiose that they not only allowed theatrical affect: they also encouraged it. I actually think a YouTube video of the Broadway musical would be easier to get through. Heck, I'd go for a high school performance: at least the medium would leave no subconscious expectations to disappoint.I give it a very generous two starts for WANTING to look good and having some vague idea of what that might be in theory.",2,1,4,12 March 2019
Pretty Woman," Light fare in a much darker context than you'd expect
","'Pretty Woman' is kind of a blend of 'Cinderella' on the one hand and 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' on the other, albeit without any sort of family dynamic or any pretense to honesty about the dark side of human nature. What's left doesn't amount to anything more than a yuppie fantasy, a time-wasting crowd pleaser memorable only for finally rocketing the career of Julia Roberts into orbit. At best, the glamorous and unrealistic portrayal of prostitution enraged feminists, whose own angry demeanor has put them off to men and whose worthless Women's Studies degrees have rendered them barely unemployable, thus putting them one step away from the streets themselves.At worst, 'Pretty Woman' marks the start of the entry of softcore for women - previously confined to bodice-ripper novels read in dank closets - into the respectable mainstream. Throughout the next couple of decades it was followed up by any number of equally bland clones (notably by Richard Curtis), paralleled at the lower level by 'Trash TV' and at the higher level by 'Outlander,' the trend culminating of course in the '50 Shades of Grey' sensation in 2011.'Pretty Woman' is a hot mess, an important relic of Hollywood and pop-culture history and part of the puzzle to understanding how the entertainment industry has helped metamorphose the mother (chiefly) of the family from guardian of manners and traditional mores into defender of gay rights and champion of perpetual childhood (the 'coddled millennials' we're always hearing about trying to 'find themselves'). Ironically, while this is the sort of tripe serious film buffs would have scuffed at upon its initial release, it's difficult now to see how it could be of interest to anyone but a serious student of cinema and pop culture. However, I would keep it as far away from my own family as possible.",4,0,3,8 April 2020
Titanic," Shame, shame, shame on you, James Cameron
","I will not accuse this of being the most over-rated film I've yet seen, because, first, it has its share of redeeming qualities, and second, that honor has to go to The Illusionist (which in many ways was actually a lame attempt to ape the Titanic formula, but I've already blasted that one into the ground). Neither can I fault it for grossing so much: a film that shamelessly panders to over-emoted teenage girls is bound to produce a good showing at the box-office. But the fact that a sloppy period piece that insults the period it pays tribute to could earn such lavish sycophantic adulation from nearly all reviewers (especially celebrity film writers) is just more evidence that America's thought-élitejournalists, politicians, and academics alikehave got to be the most degenerate, gullible, and monolithic in the Western world.There are two intertwined reasons why Titanic is on balance worth seeing: the historical setting and the special effects. Enough has been written on the latter, and on the former, as well, but as an Atlantic historian I cannot express enough love for anything so exquisitely and meticulously designed floating on the ocean of my heritage, just around the time my family was making its way over from Europe. Older Rose's remark that, 'It was the ship of dreams. And it was. It really was,' ring so true. I beseech my readers: regard the volume of immigrant ship traffic in the era, admire the interior of the ship and the costumes of the passengers and contrast them to the most luxurious modern cruise liners, in an era where ships are often not a necessity, and consider how much the Western world lost in less than a century. (This sort of aesthetic history lesson is the same reason I love Chariots of Fire.)Regard, admire, compare and consider... if, that is, you can get past a script that hangs together like a soggy potato chip and pays not the least attention to real historical personages.Our two protagonists are at best naïvely laughable and at worst totally unsympathetic, their antagonists little more than cartoon characters. That the former speak like modern teenagers is quite appropriate, because they clearly ARE modern teenagers pitted against the backward old fogies of the era. Jack is a romanticized Bohemian bum with little that could possibly seduce a beautiful young Anglo-American socialite away from her privileged life. Rose wants us to believeand she convinces Jack, somehowthat deep down she's some sort of fiery rebel, yet what I saw was a girl alternating between doing the bidding of her wealthy, domineering cardboard-cutout fiancé Cal and the bidding of her impoverished, sappy, cardboard-looking loverboy Jack. There's so much ham and cheese at work you'll want to take a fork and start eating.And there is something utterly vile about their story, which, again, is clearly aimed at adolescent females, and that fact makes Titanic's moral tone all the more disturbing. This is a film with an agenda: all the authority figures are stupid murderous bigots, the 17-year-old heroine is glorified for rebelling against her mother and fornicating with a wild rover, and don't forget that wicked cabin church excluding third-class passengers from attending the Sunday service on that fateful last day of Titanic's voyage.In reality, the whole ship was completely segregated. I am told church services were excepted, though I have my doubts, but not because of snobbery on anyone's part. Third-class passengers were largely immigrants without medical certificates and in that era of the great migrations, were required to register at Ellis Island; hence U.S. law required complete segregation on all inbound European ships. And, on these grounds, it scarcely needs saying, such a liaison between Jack and Rose, far from stupid and implausible, was quite impossible.Finally, despite the segregation, Doug Phillips has pointed out, 'there is no credible evidence that first-class passengers were given priority seating rights. To the contrary, there are numerous accounts of first-class passengers giving up their seats and assisting third-class passengers into lifeboats.'There are plenty of other factual gaffes, many of them less severe (such as the bad British accents), but by far the most appalling is the libelous depiction of the ship's crew. There is no evidence that William Murdoch accepted bribes from a cowardly aristocrat, nor that he shot two men, nor that he subsequently committed suicide, and so far as I know, such a portrayal was a completely ad hoc invention on the writers' part. (James Cameron's apology to the Murdoch family was too little, too late.) The surviving passengers testified that the crew performed their duties sacrificially and heroically that evening. That is the biggest sin of this film: the real heroes of the Titanic tragedy (with the exception of Thomas Andrews) are washed over or even villanized in favor of capricious brats, only one of whom gets his comeuppance.Even so, towards the ship's final gasp of life, we do get a good sense of the imminent terror not only in Jack and Rose, but in all 1,500 souls who perished that evening. The worst moment had to be the power outage: it's those last, frightening milestones on the road to destruction that remind you where you are headed irreversibly, and the scene of the actual sinking captures this perfectly. The true story of the RMS Titanic, from its building to its sinking, and even its aftermath as grown Belfast men whose labor on that ship had been the pride and joy of their city wept in the streets at the news of her demise, is beautifully tragic and inspirational. Would that this film had captured more than a few minutes of that.",3,5,9,21 July 2007
The Godfather: Part III," Worthy of its place
","Detractors of The Godfather part III have two main gripes: the most obvious is Sofia Coppola's acting skills as Mary Corleone, and the second is the character of Michael Corleone, who bears less resemblance to the cold, calculating criminal mastermind of the first two films. Regarding the first point, I have to agree that Sofia Coppola is insufferable in this film. Thankfully, she had little screen time. However, she looked wonderful: she was convincing enough as a 'cute little lovestruck innocent daughter' that I could believe she meant a lot to her family and her father in particular.As to the second point, some things need to be born in mind. The Michael Corleone of the first two films had descended into the lowest possible place, yes, murdering his own brother (among others) by the end. He had become everything he did not want to be and worse: his reign over his family's criminal empire was Machiavellian on a level his father had never dreamed of nor would ever have allowed.But by the beginning of this film, a decade and a half had passed since he had crossed the terrible trough of fratricide. Michael's parents and brothers were all dead during this time, Tom Hagan passed away (although the loss of the character was a tragedy, it served the story very well to accent Michael's sense of isolation) and Connie was clearly far too unstable and too much of a yes-woman to ever provide true companionship. Michael was not a man easily resigned to being alone and he had a fierce protective instinct--even if it could be overrode by his jealous vengeful nature--for 'his own.' Remember that in Part I, he always hoped to return to the States as soon as possible and when this seemed a tenebrous goal, he sought a marriage and a new life in Sicily. Throughout Part II, he lost two more members of his family and his wife left him. It is not hard to imagine that the murder of Freddo would in fact be his moral trough, that the pent-up guilt could have spilt over into guilt at having deprived his young children of their mother and perhaps even a fear that they would grow up in his shadow, so he gave them up, even though he knew it meant further isolation.But he knew all along that his cold, calculating criminality had taken him to this horrible place, and so he has spent the years since sloughing through the long marsh out while yet keeping his own person intact and out of prison. Obviously, given how much he aged from Part II to Part III, such a task has taken its toll, both physically and psychologically, and this is portrayed brilliantly. And what of Michael's sudden lavishness? I can tell you from personal experience that when you experience extreme isolation from those you love, you often cling as never before to the greatest treasures of your ethnic and religious heritage, cultivating them with the utmost sincerity partly because these are reminders that you are a real human connected with others and that you belong somewhere. The need to belong somewhere and to something and someone more concrete than the 'global citizenry' is universal, and I don't know how either Puzo or Coppola could have known about this, but they did an amazing job.'What good is Confession if you don't repent?' Good question. Michael longs for redemption and forgiveness, but almost to the end he seeks legitimacy on his own terms, a quiet retirement from the Mafia. The result is a subtle illustration of the observation of the Curé d'Ambricourt in Robert Bresson's Le journal d'un Curé de campagne: 'You can't bargain with God. You must give yourself up to Him, all at once, as you are.' Michael's sins live on apart from him, and by the end are visited full circle on the people he loves.But the ending is cryptic enough that we have to ask: was Michael redeemed? Did truth and justice ultimately prevail at the Vatican? Will they ever prevail anywhere, even imperfectly, before the next life?When Anthony Corleone asks of Sicily, 'Why is such a beautiful country so violent?' he opens up yet another flood of mysteries. How to resign ourselves to living in a world of so much beautiful treasure and yet so much of it born in great crime (think, for example, of the great Deicide, of Christ redeeming mankind, nailed to the Cross)--and how and in what circumstances can they be ours for the legitimate taking and cherishing? The Godfather part III provokes such difficult questions in all those willing to see and ponder them.If the acting and cinematography are not as polished as in the second installment, a film set anywhere in Italy needs little visual embellishment, and the music sets the mood for each scene perfectly. The Godfather part III reminds us of the world ever-present outside the closed sphere of Cosa Nostra and captures the struggle of one man teetering on the high-current edge. If you are unwilling to expand your mind beyond criminal exploits and into the personal anguish of their effects on real human beings, stay away. If, however, you have even a slight appreciation for psychology and/or Roman Catholic moral theology, you will welcome this rounding out of one of the greatest sagas ever invented.",9,4,8,8 October 2008
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," I still think George Lucas is becoming senile, but someone did SOMETHING right.
","The problem with the prequel 'Star Wars' trilogy is obvious: it is largely, if not entirely, an orgy of hyperrealistic and inordinately expensive special effects capitalising on a hugely successful and endearing franchise with little attention paid to the basic framework for what makes a good movie, well, good. Of course, it all starts with the scripts, which overall are remarkably poorly written: no special effects could gloss over this tripe; nor could the fabulous talent of Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen possibly shine through these mousy lines; nor could any actor convincingly portray a character so incongruously contrived as Anakin Skywalker. Episode III is not an exception and judged objectively as a film it is not a great one.Nevertheless, 'Revenge of the Sith' succeeds impressively from a literary standpoint, emerging as arguably the most pivotal and even, in spite of its script, the most interesting installment of the 'Star Wars' franchise. For one thing, it is here that we see the emergence of everything so ubiquitous of the original Trilogy: the toppling of the Republic and the establishment of the Palpatinian Galactic Empire, the near-extinction of the Jedi, Obi-Wan the hermit, the anonymous twins Luke and Leia Skywalker, Darth Vader, the Death Star, etc. ad infinitum. Sure, in so doing the scriptwriters commit blatant breaches of continuity (didn't Leia remember her 'real mother'?) and as in Episode II trip over themselves waving, to paraphrase an acquaintance, the magic pen ('We've always talked of adopting a little girl') to accomplish what everyone knew what was going to happen anyway, but they got the job done, and everything was tied together in a fashion that was aesthetically pleasing (if nothing else). And as mightily as they tried, they couldn't undo the coolness of Obi-Wan Kenobi or Ewan McGregor.But Episode III does more than tie the saga together: it gives it at last a human and social context to which Earthlings can relate on a deep level. The allusions to the growth of presidential power were obvious to everyone (although if he claims that, 'Only the Sith deal in absolutes!' then Obi-Wan is either a Sith or a liar). The more politically and historically savvy will catch the close parallels to the imperialisation of Rome (though that was not entirely negative), the Communist coups d'état and the destruction of religion and the priestly caste, and so forth. Episode III goes into far more depth than any other film about the role of morality, religion (in this case, something straddling a wide and bizarre gulf between Roman Catholicism and Buddhism), parenthood and politics both in personal life and in society writ large in the 'Star Wars' universe. In the process there is a great deal of intelligent (if asininely delivered) commentary about the beauty, fragility and necessity of traditional order in society. (Romantics will also appreciate the swordsman's remark of the clumsy firearm, 'How uncivilised!')I give 'Episode III' a 6 out of 10 because it is not a 'great,' nor even objectively 'good,' movie: its success rests entirely on the strength of its franchise. But it rides that wave well, if lazily, and adds its own essential colour that makes the wave truly worth beholding, at least briefly.",6,4,8,10 July 2008
The Good Shepherd," Pretty good overall
","'The Good Shepherd' is at its best when it sticks to nuts-and-bolts cinematic fundamentals: good acting, good shots, engrossing characters, engaging story lines. It is at its worst when it descends into 'evolutive' political moralizing: the Cold War was a crack, the Soviets were never a menace, all the U.S. wanted was to keep up its military-industrial complex, the WASP was desperate to keep the Irish Catholic and the Jew out of the rungs of power, etc. etc..All the same, the film manages to pay tribute both to American history and sociology as well as to the greatness of American cinema. Taking care to show a good cross-section of the post-war U.S. society, the film manages a good send-up of the worst of Old Yankee Puritan society in chronicling the devastating effects of hard-line, Manichean detachment on life. Matt Damon's character is appropriately cold and dehumanized, unable to respond to his dutiful and perceptive ('Bonesmen first; God second') wife, played brilliantly by Angelina Jolie. The melodramatic music recounts to great effect the banal but lovable blockbusters of the 1990s, before giving way to the chilling silence of the rude awakening along the path to sophistication.Overall a carefully if a bit too cynically crafted work. It does make for an excellent diversion on an evening when one is feeling nostalgic for times past long before one was in fact born. I certainly enjoyed it on a solitary holiday in NYC on 31 December 2006.",7,1,2,16 December 2015
Cinderella," It's Disney.
","First of all, let's discuss the positives of this film, namely the production value. The drawings and the animation are gorgeous, and the music is catchy and perfectly-crafted. It's not for nothing that people speak of 'Disney magic,' and what else would come to mind but a fairy godmother and a beautiful girl? Disney's Cinderella is certainly a cultural icon.And that's really unfortunate for our culture. Because, you see, the writers of the script decided to favor the synthesis of the eye candy magic over the essence of the original story. Disney's Cinderella appears to be an unwilling captive in a situation so bad we cannot understand why she does not run away: she IS shown to be of at least moderately illustrious ascendancy and surely she could at least start out in a more worthy setting somewhere else before her masters take note that she's perhaps issue of an education not quite comparable to that of the other scullery maids?Charles Perrault's Cinderella was rather clearer on this point. Cinderella loved her father and even though his second wife and stepdaughters were cruel to her, she stayed behind to look after them out of love for her father, knowing he wanted his two families to love each other and to meld together. This is made clear at the first ball (in the Disney version, there is only one, and the story is robbed of commensurate death): the prince takes notice of Cinderella and gives her a plateau of oranges and lemons (a rarity in 17th-century France), and she immediately finds her stepsisters and shares the dessert with them. The message is that Cinderella had it all to move up in the world, deep interior beauty as well as outer beauty, and just a little bit of divine intervention (through her fairy godmother) cleaned up and allowed people to look past an otherwise soot-laden exterior. She was noble both in birth and in character and she deserved the royal treatment she ended up getting.But Disney's Cinderella does... nothing. Not even talk. And she gets the prince's attention. And what, did she just leave her father's second family behind once she got into the palace? Not that they didn't deserve it (they deserved much, much worse, of course!). But the whole meaning of the original is lost. Her stepmother and stepsisters are not seen at the wedding. Disney's Cinderella is just a pretty but ordinary 'nice girl' who happens to be of noble birth and possesses little gray matter.What's the point?? I mean, seriously, this stuff is porno for little girls. Yes, everyone wants to move up, everyone wants to be royal. And I'm NOT a feminist. But this kind of passive corset-stringing is not a good role model. The message is, 'Bide your time and be pretty and someone will come to rescue you.' What about developing the kind of loving and thoughtful character and self-esteem that will attract a decent man - and touch the lives of others while you're at it?Overally, really not a constructive addition to the film canon, whatever its technical merits.",5,4,12,8 December 2013
The Hangover Part III," A failure
","About the only good thing that can be said about 'The Hangover part III' is that it did not repeat the error of 'The Hangover part II' in rehashing a very funny story (from the original 'The Hangover') whose comedic timing depended entirely on elemental shock and could offer nothing to up the ante except more raunch and more violence. The problem is that what it had to offer in this stead was completely stupid and pointless.Alan is the foil, the deliberate but well-intentioned anti-hero of this movie, as he is in the first two movies. The difference is that the character in the first two is static, never progressing and just being his plain old dumb dangerous lovable self, hints but never express data communicated with respect to the psychiatric malaise that makes him the oaf he is. The third film attempts to transform him into a dynamic character, one who becomes conscious of the evil he does, but this time the evil is entirely unforeseen and there is no intention.The problem is that once we understand Alan's real problem and lose the ambiguity, the original concept is retroactively destroyed and we forget all about the humor that made us fall in love with these characters in the first place. We end up just flat-out NOT CARING in the end. The simple fact is that the universe of 'The Hangover' was not set up to handle the sort of drawn-out, complex emotional melodrama that this film wants to be without killing the quirky charm that made the original hit such a crisp note with so many people the world over in the first place.A few people have suggested that simply expanding on the cliffhanger ending, which resembles the initial rising action moment in the first two films in the midst of the hangover after a Very Bad Trip (the title of the franchise in France), would have made for a more entertaining film. There are two problems with this suggestion. First of all, there is no reason to think that doing so would have ended up producing something funny, unless you are the type who thinks that Part II was on par with the original. Second, the very premise on which the scene turns depends on the climax, falling action and dénouement of Part III as it is made, so deleting this development would make such an expansion totally incomprehensible.But as it is, the ending is problematic as an extension of Part III, because it suggests either that Alan is at fault, in which case the preceding dynamic action on his character is entirely negated, or that this happened despite and not because of him, in which case we conclude that either he or the group is cursed and that therefore nothing he does to change will ever make a difference, thereby negating any meaning of the preceding dynamic action.Basically, to make a long story short, as is sometimes the case with great, spontaneous fiction, the creators of the first film hadn't a clue what they created, or how to handle it without breaking it. We suspected as much with Part II, and were it not for rent-seeking Hollywood speculators who by necessity line up to cash in on popular franchises, we would wonder how they could have had the shamelessness to prove as much once and for all in Part III. But even this plan seems to have backfired when Part III took in $30 million less in its opening weekend than originally expected.And that little piece of trivia inspires me to write this little note to Los Angeles: you no longer have a quasi-monopoly on the film business, and the experience of other brands-turned-commodities (think the broadcast trio, think Kodak, think Microsoft) strongly suggests that once your commanding lead begins to fade, your share can go downhill much faster than you anticipate. The ordinary consumers who pony up for the tickets the sales of which make movies into blockbusters might well be stupid, but they're probably not as stupid as you think. Probably a good time to stop being so dismissive toward your breadbasket, huh? For example, by not re-exploiting a tired franchise.",1,5,10,9 June 2013
Sin City," Legally obscene
","Sin City is pornography. And I am not referring to the small bit of nudity: I am referring to the wanton, senseless, nihilistic violence throughout the entire tome. It is pornographic because it is an escapist fantasy; as others have pointed out, it would be unacceptable shot in full-color.The lack of color is not merely an interesting visual technique: it is a metaphor for the colorlessness of most of these characters, which is why they blend together and the 'plot,' if you will call it that, hangs together like a soggy potato chip.Do we really need another movie in which the Christian cleric and the Crucifix-sporting brat are the bad guys? We are all well-aware that Hollywood is full of immoral Christophobes, so without any meaningful commentary, is there any point?If you're looking for eye candy, you can do better. If you're looking for a good story, about the only thing below this is 'Batman Returns.'",3,2,7,9 October 2007
Gangs of New York," Quality gets MPD
","Gangs of New York suffers from Multiple Personality Disorder in terms of its quality. We have, on the one hand, the masterful talent of Martin Scorcese, Daniel Day-Lewis and (though he is drastically underused here) Liam Neeson, a setting in the dynamic and brilliantly reconstructed New York City of the mid-nineteenth century, the themes of Civil War Draft Riots and a rapidly expanding and industrializing country attempting to cope with sudden and massive expansion and waves of European immigration. For anyone who has lived in the northeast and whose forefathers crossed through Ellis Island, there is nothing more we could ask for.Unfortunately, we also have the sometimes talented but dreadfully miscast Leonardo DiCaprio aping an awful Irish accent across a horrifically made up Cameron Diaz (whose accent is equally awful). In spite of the great visual recreations, the film tacitly ignores some important historical points, and not merely by bending dates and character traits: the idea that Irish or other poor European immigrants would have associated with Chinese (almost non-existent in the Manhattan of the day) or blacks is downright laughable. The great climactic action scene is rather dry, nuanced, and thoughtlessly executed. In fact, the film's action takes place only at a few checkpoints throughout, and meantime we are forced to sit through two and a half hours of incomprehensible intrigue and completely unsympathetic characters.And yet, to add further confusion, we are told that internal disputes had forced Scorcese to make 'damaging' cuts to the release version of this film, and that fans have been clamoring for him to release an even more painfully dragged-out director's cut (a request which he has firmly resisted). So in the end, Gangs of New York is a very pretty and awful mess, much like the actual city of New York must have been in the 1860's. Scorcese's nostalgia for the old New York City is one I fully sympathize with, but this nostalgia hardly suffices to cement a solid film.",6,1,3,2 December 2007
The Wedding Singer," Like a kiddie ride at the county fair: somewhat fun, but comes up short of a 'thrill'
","This movie is a rather obvious product of a washed-up 30-something nostalgic for the glory days of late high school/early college. Given the pace and pop culture of everyday life in 1998's America wasn't yet all that different from what it had been in 1985 (though consumer purchases were more frequent and bigger-ticket and the music scene a bit drowsier thirteen years on), there wasn't much room to do anything imaginative with the film's setting, which allows for at most some funky hairdos and a few references to the specific pop entertainment acts of the time, not all of which hit the mark.(On the other hand, Alexis Arquette as an obsessed perennial Boy George LARPer was perhaps an appropriate touch - well, about as 'appropriate' as one can get in a movie destined for cinemas planted in single-family-unit-dominated neighborhoods - for paying tribute to an era. My, how the times have changed! Nowadays any movie which portrayed androgynous behavior as anything but supremely normal would never make the censors today. The Catholic Legion of Decency in Golden-era Hollywood clearly had different priorities from those of the thought police of our day, but I don't think they were ever anywhere near as hammer-fisted.)So the treatment needed to be put on hold for another 15 years, at least, but it also needed a more imaginative writer. The plot is a completely formulaic and predictable mishmash of love triangles and early-adulthood angst. Unable to really milk its still-green period's idiosyncracies, the film appeals for humor to the lowest common denominator of the time of release (although, this would quickly be relegated to the ranks of the much tamer after the following year unleashed upon the world the likes of 'American Pie' and 'Austin Powers: the Spy Who Shagged Me').However, all is not in vain. The main characters are for the most part fun and charming. Drew Barrymore and Christine Taylor ooze charm and sweetness as the cheery waitress heroine and her free-wheeling cousin, while Adam Sandler proves he can convincingly portray a 'normal' boy-next-door lead. Matthew Glave as the self-inflated fiancé isn't given much but has fun making his character as loathsome as possible; the female variant by Angela Featherstone is equally delightful to hate, probably the brightest spot in the movie, to be honest. Too bad you can count her minutes on screen on your hands.Overall, worth your time if you want some light fare and really cannot think of anything else to watch. The musical nostalgia aspect has aged well enough, even though with hindsight the soundtrack didn't necessarily incorporate the songs or artists with the most enduring legacies (and some of the best ones they DID include didn't make either of the accompanying soundtracks). Still, I wouldn't mind seeing a more thoughtful 80s-set romantic comedy with a bit spicier period music, sharper idiosyncratic references and a bit of commentary on the period contrasts (mostly in favor of that period against ours, but those who know my sociopolitical leanings won't be surprised I tend to think the past was better). I think such a piece would be pretty marketable. Hollywood, you listening?",6,2,4,13 June 2019
Valkyrie," A racy film that insults these great and truly NOBLE men
","Valkyrie is a racy film that keeps you on the edge of your seat, although of course we all know how this story turns out. Unfortunately, it is told in such a way as to advance the post-modern agenda, continuing--albeit passively--the massive destruction of the Nazis into the post-Nazi era. Occidental civilisation is still committing suicide, and cultural barons such as these filmmakers are the reasons why. In no particular order:1. It is true that the Nazis' systematic internment and gassing of millions of Jews was a horrid crime. So was the similar treatment they gave to an unknown number--probably millions--of non-Jews. So was their brutal bulldozing of Ukraine and European Russia. Klaus von Stauffenberg's memorial makes it sound as though the gassing of Jews was Hitler's only crime. It was not.Now before you cast me as a closet anti-Semite, my objection is not to the depiction of the Jews as victims but to the shameless post-modern exploitation of racism, sexism, 'ageism' and 'homophobia' for profit, or worse--a grievous sin against both productivity and fairness. Look up 'Southern Poverty Law Center' and 'ACORN.' Incidentally, one of my closest friends--an agnostic Jewess--is in agreement with me about the disgusting and exploitive 'Holocaust Industry.'2. Klaus von Stauffenberg was first and foremost a pious man and a pedigreed aristocrat who believed above all in the supreme authority of God and in the legitimacy of terrestrial rulers. His beliefs were deeply seated from a transmission of many generations of faith and legitimate power. He was aware that tyrannicide is a delicate matter in Catholic theology and only justifiable under the gravest circumstances.You would never know that from watching this film. Stauffenberg's Catholic religion is glossed over in the beginning and then never mentioned again, as though God had abandoned these great Christians in their noble struggle. (My own theory, based on my limited knowledge of Maistre, is that their failure was allowed as a punishment on Europe for turning its back on God. But God never abandoned these great men: they are, today, in a place where they no longer suffer the treachery of us, their colourless subjects.) Nor is Stauffenberg shown to consult, as he did, with Cardinal Count Preysing of Berlin, who advised Stauffenberg of the morality of this move and even risked his own life to help the plot.3. Tom Cruise cannot act in any role except Ethan Hunt. Casting him as the great aristocrat Klaus von Stauffenberg is an insult to this latter man's memory.Shame, shame, shame, shame. Any chance you get to overheat the film lamp or throw a DVD in the microwave, take it. Wipe this shameful underreporting off the map of history.",3,3,7,5 October 2009
The Godfather," Apparently it's popular with its subject matter, even...
","Everything about The Godfather is brilliantly framed--well, almost. The depiction of Sicilian country life is, perhaps, a bit crass. Even so, its insular depiction of the world of Cosa Nostra was true enough to life to win the laud even of members of the criminal organisation.In the first place, 'The Godfather' does an excellent job of weaving together the literal and metaphorical world of the mafia. Within the mafia, traditional institutions are given a warped, double meaning in which to frame illicit activity. For example, 'mafioso' literally means, 'man of honour,' but 'honour' refers to a loyalty to an entirely different set of rules than those to which any Christian (or post-Christian) would consider even remotely acceptable. 'Famiglia,' as used in Cosa Nostra, means a criminal corporation. 'Cristiano' in the Sicilian tongue often designates not merely a Christian but any human being; to CN it signifies any ordinary man of honor. As for 'godfather,' one mafioso standing godfather to another's son is often a formalisation of an illegal business pact.Puzo's and Coppola's Corleonesci, however, carry the double-edged sword of actually showing both meanings of these loaded words. The mafia family here IS a literal family; the men of honor, portrayed as they are in a closed word, CAN actually be viewed sympathetically as 'honourable.' (Of course in real life most mafiosi are literally Catholics {albeit sham Catholics}.) Here, the closed world so carefully guarded through layers of command in real life is given further immunity and legitimacy by actually being what it publicly claims to be--and so much more.Little needs to be said about the performances, which are by and large stellar; the casting of Al Pacino is of course a near sure sign that the film will succeed. Perhaps Diane Keaton may not be much to look at, but she does not play a major role in this installment. Neither do the cinematography, the score, the high-level tension, etc. ad infinitum, require further laud than has already been heaped upon this film. If you haven't seen it yet, you've probably been living under a rock. Immaculate taste and Latin sophistication await, all ye primitives...",10,2,4,2 May 2008
