Lucky Number Slevin," Slevin (Hartnett) is catapulted into an awful case of mistaken identity going between two rival mobsters of New York (Freeman and Kingsley).
","This movie was amazing. It was witty all around and Hartnett, Willis, and Freeman, being some of my favorite actors, were perfect fits for their roles. Everything came together in the end and it all made sense. It really was a thinker so if you aren't in the mood to think, this isn't really the movie for you. But if you love action, suspense, humor, action violence, and everything that goes along with it, you're in luck. You will like this movie if you liked 'Fight Club' and 'V for Vendetta'. Sure it was a little predictable, but hey, it makes you feel good about yourself that you could put two and two together. Lots of twists and turns. A top notch movie.",10,2,9,7 April 2006
