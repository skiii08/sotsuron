The King's Speech," The best film I have seen in ages!!!!
","Having read a few reviews regarding the film of the moment 'The Kings Speech', I went to my local cinema to see it today. Not quite sure what I was letting myself in for really, as most of the audience was of a certain age but none the less we all sat there with intrigue and anticipation waiting for the film to start. Not sure what it was that took over my thoughts and desires but I was in desperate need to see this film. From the moment it started I was mesmerized. I was trans-fixed on the screen. The film is filled with moments of sadness, frustration and humour all of which I felt whilst watching the movie. The actors are BRILLIANT, every single one of them. Colin Firth and Helena Bonham Carter were amazing. I have even seen Timothy Spall in a new light, although he had a small part- very good indeed. Although I was not born in that era, I certainly felt as if I was there especially seeing what London would have been like at that time. At the end of the movie, all I could hear was members of the audience commenting on how good the film was. It seemed everyone was satsified.Cant wait for the DVD to be released, may even go to the cinema and see it again. As I have said the best film I have seen for some time and is truly brilliant. I came away feeling satisifed that I have spent money on ever increasing cinema fees and had the most wonderful time. I feel the cast and crew have done the UK proud in this movie and would be keen to know what the Royal Family think about it. If it does not sweep the awards ceremonies then I would be shocked and devastated. Everyone must see this movie. It is BRILLIANT BRILLIANT BRILLIANT, love it, love it, love it.",10,1,5,11 January 2011
