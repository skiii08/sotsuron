Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The best kids movie in a long time
","Queueing up for tickets for the most eagerly awaited movie of all time I took a minute to look around at all the other people waiting in the queue, I do not think there were any children there. Do we all forget it is a children's movie, which is why we all loved the original movies when we were kids we all pretended to be Luke Skywalker and Han Solo in the back yard. 'The Phantom Menace' has a good story line, granted some of the dialogue in the film leaves much to be desired but allot of the dialogue in the original trilogy is the same. The effects are superb not on a par with 'Matrix' but not far behind. George Lucas could of made the movie a higher rated film and had lots of bloodshed but that is not the essence of star wars it is a children's fantasy film, it wasn't written for adults. The fact is 'The Phantom Menace' never could have lived up to expectations it is unfortunately a victim of the success of the franchise.",10,15,22,14 August 2001
Unbreakable," Good story? Bad Ending?
","I listened to the build up, entered the theater with great hopes sat down and started to get involved in a decent story line. The on screen connection between Willis and Jackson is excellent you can tell the men have worked together before. The story builds up slowly but strongly until half an hour before the end of the film and then it falls to pieces. It seems as if the writer got block and couldn't figure out where to go and decided to write the dismal climax, the worst ending to a potentially excellent movie. Its a shame that such a potentially good film was destroyed again. Is it just that producers and film writers are getting sloppy?",2,0,1,12 August 2001
