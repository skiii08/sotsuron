Mission: Impossible III," Mission Impossible: Alias
","I thought the new Mission Impossible film was mediocre. The characters were not developed. The story had potential and Philip Seymore Hoffman was great but overall it just wasn't that exciting. Also, for those who have been following J.J. Abrams work Mission: Impossible III bared a striking resemblance to the pilot episode of Alias. The narrative structure and the story were all very similar. I know J. J. Abrams was only one of three writers on the film but it definitely seemed like he just revamped his five year old pilot and reversed the gender roles and made Mission Impossible III..4/10",4,1,1,12 May 2006
