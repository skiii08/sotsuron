The Avengers," Marvel Studios has finally brought the whole team together
","Marvel Studios has finally brought the whole team together, after years of hinting at the Avengers initiative coming to fruition to fight united against evil, they have done it. The Avengers was not only a reunion of Marvel's best loved superheroes, but it is a fun and funny, action-packed blockbuster movie to kick off the Summer movie season as it opened to an astounding $207.4 million, the single biggest grossing domestic film opening weekend of all time. It topped Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 by more than $38 million, the previous record holder. Why has this film done so well? Everyone loves it! The critics love it (93% Rotten Tomatoes rating) and Marvel fans love it and the average moviegoer has loved it. The film is almost completely devoid of romance and sex which hurts some of the draw of female audiences, but its non-stop action, fast-paced storyline and awesome special effects keeps viewers engaged. The odd joke thrown in here and there is a brilliant touch that does irritate, but instead adds to the experience.

The Hunger Games," 'May the odds be ever in your favor.'
","'May the odds be ever in your favor.'Check out my full review at: http://reelstorymovies.blogspot.com/2012/04/hunger-games.htmlThe Hunger Games was a disturbing sci-fi dystopian tale of futuristic North America, that has been replaced by Panem, a country made up of 12 districts ruled by a dictatorship called the Capitol, who yearly pits one male and one female (ages 14-19 years old) from each district against each other in an arena in a battle to the death until one child remains.Visually, the movie is beautiful and has cool special effects as described in the young adult novel published with the same name. However, the disturbing plot is the less brilliant aspect of the film. The movie takes a long time to get into the meat of the story, namely, the Hunger Games. Much of the time, the film feels more like someone is reading you a (more boring) book instead of actually watching it.This is not a compliment. The movie feels like it follows very closely with the book (something I have read), but there are parts where instead of connecting emotionally with the characters and really feeling the fear, the exhilaration, or the remorse of the 'games'.Part of the problem with the film is that much of the book consists of Katniss, the lead character, and her thoughts and emotions running through her. The author, Suzanne Collins (a writer for Emmy-nominated children's hits Clarissa Explains it All and The Mystery Files of Shelby Woo among other things) uses the countless thoughts and emotions surging through Katniss' brain to tell the tale of her emotions and of how she copes with the horrors of living in the impoverished Seam of District 12, how she disobeys the Capitol by hunting in the off-limits forest nearby her home, and her feelings towards marriage, raising kids in a terrifying world like Panem, and her interests in two male friends.These thoughts were not provided in the film to its detriment. Collins captures in her novels so seamlessly who Katniss really is that as readers we can relate to her, feel for her and understand her fears in such a world, whereas the movie feels more emotionally distant. It's much harder in the film to really understand these 'kids' fighting against one another and oftentimes as observers, the viewers are more just watching what goes on, on the screen and reacting.The movie lacks character development and love interests between the main characters. It struggles to really connect viewers to the grotesque acts on the scene and it really hurts the movie as a whole.Still, millions of viewers have flocked to the film the past couple of weeks, as it has earned over $250 million at the box office in its opening two weeks, however, the film was a bit disappointing in some of the areas that are most important areas.Jennifer Lawrence plays a terrific Katniss Everdeen and Woody Harrelson gives a memorable performance as the bumbling drunk, Haymitch Abernathy. The others give an average performance and are forgettable.For me, I left the theater feeling disappointed at Gary Ross' attempts to re-create the same feeling Collins created in her novels. Instead of feeling for these poor kids, I feel nauseous.My Score – Overall Rating: 6.75 out of 10 Plot: 7 out of 10 Character Development: 6 out of 10 Acting: 6 out of 10 Audio/Visuals: 8 out of 10",7,2,9,11 April 2012
The Irishman," Three-Plus Hour Mafia Epic
","'The Irishman' directed by Martin Scorsese, starring Robert DeNiro as Frank Sheeran, Joe Pesci as Russ Bufalino, and Al Pacino as Jimmy Hoffa.'The Irishman' is a three-plus hour epic about Italian mafia families in the northeast Philadelphia-area. It is reminiscent of Scorsese's earlier critically-acclaimed mafia movie, 'Goodfellas,' also starring DeNiro and Pesci.I thought some of the hype on this year's Netflix contender was overblown. The story is a dramatization of Charles Brandt's book, 'I Heard You Paint Houses' a tell-all book of the mafia's criminal activities in the mid-twentieth century.The film ties together some of the conspiracy theories of John F. Kennedy's assassination and the disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa. The actors' performances, the screenwriting and directing were all superb, but as a whole it was all a little too much. Two or three times I was looking at my watch saying, 'how much longer is this movie?' I feel like after watching this film, I felt sick to my stomach and didn't have to watch another mafia movie again in my life. Yuck!While I am sure it is destined to win some awards in February, it isn't going to be my pick or preference. There are much better ways to spend more than three hours of your time.",7,1,6,2 January 2020
The Adventures of Tintin," 'You care about something, you fight for it. You hit a wall, you push through it.'
","'You care about something, you fight for it. You hit a wall, you push through it.' – Captain Haddock.Check out my full review at: http://reelstorymovies.blogspot.com/2012/04/adventures-of-tintin.htmlSteven Spielberg's computer animated children's movie, 'The Adventures of Tintin' is a fun, thrill ride, which is suitable for older kids and adults all the same. The movie, fashioned from the most popular European comics in the 20th century, is a dazzling rendition of the famous Belgian artist Georges Remi (1907–1983), who published the series of comic albums under the pen name of Hergé.As far as source material is concerned, Spielberg's adaptation of Remi's famous work revolves around the story of meeting, and then collaborating with the drunken, and kidnapped Captain Haddock, who has had his ship taken from him after a mutiny.The classic Tintin character, Captain Haddock, played by Andy Serkis, escapes with Tintin and snowy (his white fox terrier dog) and embark on an adventure together to find Captain Haddock's grandfather's sunken treasure on the Unicorn.The tale is engaging and exciting. It was well-directed and was filled with suspense. The action scenes, while implausible and hearkening back to Spielberg's days directing Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, draw you into the fantasy world unfolding on the screen.The most impactful point of the movie is when it appears like all hope is lost. The bad guys have gotten away with the secret message Haddock left, Tintin and Haddock are stranded, and Haddock gives a rousing speech to encourage Tintin to push through this 'wall' they face: 'Failed. There are plenty of others willing to call you a failure. A fool. A loser. A hopeless souse. Don't you ever say it of yourself. You send out the wrong signal, that is what people pick up. Don't you understand? You care about something, you fight for it. You hit a wall, you push through it. There's something you need to know about failure, Tintin. You can never let it defeat you.'While the animation is similar to any other animated film, it lacks Hergé's signature ligne claire style, which characterized his comics. Tintin is easily recognizable by his red hair, and the front which sticks up, but Hergé's signature style is largely absent in the animation of Tintin.Tintin and Haddock's 'stick-to-it-ness' is a highlight of the movie as they endure impossible odds, are faced with countless detours and missteps, yet continue on in their pursuit of the goal.It reminds me a lot of the Christian life. That it is a marathon, not a sprint. That there are ups and downs, there are failures and successes, and to continue to run the race, pursue the goal, that is key. That is and will always be the point: to never give up and to continue on until the end.In Philippians 3, Paul urges his fellow followers of Jesus to press on, like him, even a great apostle who has planted several churches with great results. He tells the Philippians: Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already arrived at my goal, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me. Brothers and sisters, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead, I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus. - Philippians 3:12-14As Christians today, we need to follow Paul's example. We need to exhibit this same type of never give up, never say die attitude that Captain Haddock spurs Tintin on to, even when it looks like all hope is lost.I also liked the team that Haddock, Tintin, and little snowy, formed as Haddock was a lost and drunken soul, desiring adventure and purpose, and snowy was a little dog, but both played a very important role in the trio finding what they sought: treasure.In order for us, as Christians, to go the distance we need each other. We need people to keep us focused on what really matters. We need those around us to encourage us to continue when we are ready to give up. We need someone to tell us that we can do it and we must go on, and not let us settle for failure.Haddock's word ring true for us too in this life: 'There's something you need to know about failure, you can never let it defeat you.'My Score – Overall Rating: 8.25 out of 10 Plot: 9 out of 10 Character Development: 7 out of 10 Acting: 8 out of 10 Audio/Visuals: 8 out of 10",8,0,0,11 April 2012
21 Jump Street," 21 Jump Street is a cool, relevant, and hilarious re-make
","21 Jump Street is a cool, relevant, and hilarious re-make of the classic teen TV series of the same name. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum carry the film with their crazy antics which both pokes fun at the 80's and adds their own enjoyable comedy. They pull off one of the hardest things in film: turning a thing of the past into something that is both exciting and worth your time and money to see. The film manages to both connect with this generation which is into 'green' initiatives, texting, and feelings, something that previous generations scoffed at and mocked. I thoroughly enjoyed the acting by Tatum and Hill as they generated some good chemistry as they return to their own years as high-school students, but with their roles reversed.

","The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a heart-pumping thriller that captures you in its grip of horror and intrigue until the final second.Check out my full review here at: http://reelstorymovies.blogspot.com/2012/04/girl-with- dragon- tattoo.htmlIt is methodically calculating as it counts down to the discovery of the wolf in sheep's clothing. The cast is phenomenal. Rooney Mara (Lisbeth Salander) steals the show with her brilliant intellect, her seductive appeal, and her ruthless defense of the defenseless. She stands apart among a top cast in David Fincher's masterpiece. Daniel Craig (Mikael Blomkvist) plays an embattled journalist who has been tricked into trading in his credibility for a story. He is a great investigative journalist who has a vulnerable side.The ageless Christopher Plummer (Henrik Vanger) is the wary, kind uncle (and former CEO of the family business) who has been searching for the murderer of his dear niece who vanished years before from the island Henrik and his family (and relatives) have occupied for decades. On the day of her murder only family members were present on the island, all of them together in one place, and no particular evidence pointing any one person in particular.After the embarrassing imprisonment of Blomkvist after losing his libel case made against Hans-Eric Wennerström, a Swedish billionaire industrialist, his Millennium magazine is faltering and Blomkvist is approached by Henrik to investigate the murder of his niece, Harriet. Blomkvist takes a step down from Millennium with the promise of a hefty compensation and solid evidence against Wennerström if he can crack the cold case of Harriet's murder. He is welcomed to the family's isolated and frigid island, off the coast of Sweden.Blomkvist interviews the remaining family members living on the island searching for clues. His investigation really heats up after he finds photographs of Harriet the morning of her murder in town attending a parade. He further ascertains that he needs access to the company's records in order to discover who the killer is. In order to comb the family business' archives, he hires Lisbeth Salander, a pierced, tattooed, goth computer hacker and private investigator, and the same young woman who investigated his past before Henrik hired him.Blomkvist and Salander have a complicated relationship in the film, as partners, lovers, and confidants. As they research all of the details surrounding the murder, they discover that it isn't just Harriet who has been murdered but woman all over the country that have been marked as cold cases are cropping up with ties to Harriet and Harriet's family. The rising action in the film builds enormous tension as Blomkvist pokes around somewhere he shouldn't be and Salander uncovers dark secrets of her own.Director David Fincher does a remarkable job with the horrifying discovery of the perpetrator of the murders and then the character's realization of how deep they've gotten themselves. It is terrible and wonderful all at the same time.The film has graphic sexual content which is not suitable for younger audiences or anyone sensitive to sexual content. It is persistent throughout the film.My Score – Overall Rating: 9.75 out of 10 Plot: 9 out of 10 Character Development: 10 out of 10 Acting: 10 out of 10 Audio/Visuals: 10 out of 10",10,2,9,17 April 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," The Amazing Spider-Man is better than the original
","The Amazing Spider-Man is better than the original.The film is a re-boot of a franchise that is exactly a decade old, but offers a new and fresh look at the part man, part arachnid that is Peter Parker. The film greatly benefits from its stellar cast led by Andrew Garfield (Social Network) as Peter Parker and Emma Stone (The Help) as Gwen Stacy, who shine in their roles as teenage love interests.Andrew Garfield brings a completely different feel to Peter Parker as an awkward but caring teen who wants to help others, but is also trying to figure out what he really wants. Questions continue to swirl around his parents' mysterious disappearance and Parker wrestles with his feeling of abandonment.Check out my full review here: http://reelstorymovies.blogspot.com/2012/07/amazing-spider-man.html",8,1,5,12 July 2012
Goon," Goon is funny but also has surprising substance
","Goon is a funny comedy about hockey with some surprising substance. Despite its limited cast featuring Jay Baruchel and Seann William Scott as well as Liev Schreiber and a couple of other people you may have heard of or seen in other random movies, the story transcends the blood and gore and focuses on Doug Glatt (Seann William Scott), a hockey goon, who finds his true purpose in life: beating the snot out of people. It's a story about finding your calling, sticking together as a team, and being the best you can be, even if that's being a hockey goon.Check out my full review here: http://reelstorymovies.blogspot.com/2012/06/goon.html",8,3,3,29 June 2012
No Strings Attached," No Strings Attached is a funny, feel-good romantic comedy
","Spoiler Alert: Some of the commentary here may contain information that might spoil the ending. No Strings Attached is a funny, feel-good romantic comedy about a couple who learn about the benefits of commitment in a relationship. While some married couples, who already enjoy the benefits of their lifelong commitment that they have made with their spouses and scoff at a film such as this one, which unashamedly glorifies one night stands, hooking up, and friends with benefits, the film's central message is one that points anyone interested in finding meaning and purpose in a relationship to real love, which is a choice. Real love is the choice of commitment. It is about a vow, something sacred and solemn that cannot be broken. Real love is about sticking with it when things are hard. Real love is about accepting one another's foibles and mistakes and still loving.

1917," Tense War Movie Filmed in a Single Shot
","One of the frontrunners for this year's Oscar for Best Picture is Sam Mendes' epic World War I film, 1917, starring Dean-Charles Chapman, George MacKay, Daniel Mays, Colin Firth and Benedict Cumberbatch among others.Mendes (Director of Skyfall, Road to Perdition and American Beauty) helms this film, which has been nominated for ten Oscars including: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Makeup/Hairstyling, Best Production Design, Best Original Score, Best Visual Effects, Best Sound Mixing and Best Sound Editing. The film already took home wins at the Golden Globes in Best Picture-Drama, and Best Director.The film is a taut thriller filled with non-stop tense moments as Lance Corporal Blake and Lance Corporal Schofield, officers in the British army are tasked with going through no man's land, behind enemy lines, through a web of peril to deliver a message to their fellow soldiers to call off an offensive as where they plan to attack is a trap. The attack is planned for the following morning at dawn and time is short.One of the most unique parts of the film is how it is shot as a 'single shot.' Meaning the entire film is one continuous scene. It shows the soldiers on the run through the multitude of dangers without stopping. There are a few places where the scenes were 'cut' when it transitions from outside to underground in the trench, but the feel of the movie is a non-stop, pulse-pounding, action-packed stream that never lets up.Mendes, who also had a hand in the screenplay, co-written with Krysty Wilson-Cairns, is based on stories of the Great War from his own grandfather, Lance Corporal Alfred Hubert Mendes.Mendes commented on his inspiration for the film:
'Our film is fiction, but certain scenes and aspects of it are drawn from stories he told me, and ones told him by his fellow soldiers. This simple kernel of an idea-of a single man carrying a message from one place to another-stayed with me and became the starting point for 1917.'The film, like many modern war films that precede it, focuses on both the hellish nature of war, especially trench warfare, but also the heroism and willingness of soldiers to sacrifice their own lives for the fellow countrymen and the cause. There are also some similarities to Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan set in the First World War.I really enjoyed the film. I think the cinematography and the single shot approach was unique and impacting. The story was compelling. The acting was superb. There were a lot of things the film did well. The score and sound brought an atmospheric feeling enhancing the drama and tension building on the screen.Definitely recommend this film for anyone who enjoys action, thrillers and war films.",9,5,8,24 January 2020
Joker," Disturbing Film that Celebrates the Sociopath Villain
","I just saw 'Joker' starring Joaquin Phoenix, as the titular character, directed by Todd Phillip, because of its Oscar nomination for Best Picture, and the great odds that Phoenix will win the Oscar for Best Actor for his performance.That being said, I had a lot of apprehension going into it. I had put off watching it for more than four months, as it released on October 4. The movie, as expected, was very dark and very violent. The gun violence in particular is a disturbingly prominent component of the movie.A central theme of the film was mental illness and society's ignorance and lack of concern for people with very real needs. The unfolding of the horror on screen highlights some of the complicated issues involved. There are certainly no easy answers or quick fixes.Another theme was pitting the rich against the poor. Arthur Fleck, aka Joker, is a struggling comedian, living in a rundown apartment with his aging mom. Thomas Wayne is a wealthy philanthropist, who speaks out against the murder of three Wall Street stockbrokers on the subway. The film revives the ongoing discussion of wealth inequality of the 1%, movements like Occupy Wall Street, and films like 'V for Vendetta.' Fleck, though an outcast, bullied his entire life, laughed at (not for the jokes), becomes a symbol for the poor and downtrodden to stand up against the oppression of the wealthy.The film portrays him both as heinous villain and unlikely hero. The ugly crimes he commits make you turn away, but also causes you to pause. Joker becomes the leader of a revolution, however, you can see that revolution through violence and hate leads to a dark, destructive path.The film also stars Robert DeNiro, Zazie Beetz and Frances Conroy, among others. It was nominated for 11 Oscars including: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Makeup/Hairstyling, Best Original Score, Best Film Editing, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Sound Editing.How do I feel about the film? Joaquin Phoenix was an excellent sociopath.But I wouldn't watch it again.The movie depicts how scary anarchism could really become if people chose to rise up and follow someone like Joker. I think there are some terrifying parallels between someone like Hitler and Joker. People filled with hate, who experience a taste of power, and then decide to wield that power to carry out their own personal vengeance against the object of their ire. The fabric of society tears apart at the seams as hate overtakes all reason.",7,0,2,28 January 2020
