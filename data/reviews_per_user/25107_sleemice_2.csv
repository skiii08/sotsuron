Hereditary," It really is the scariest movie of the year
","Expect the unexpected!!! I just finished watching it and I don't think I can watch it again. It's just too scary for me. It's scary, in a good way, but maybe too much for wimps like me.",10,6,15,16 June 2018
The Exorcist," Best horror movie of all time
","This movie set the standard for most of the best horror movies coming out these days i.e. guts , gore and decapitation aren't necessary to make a good horror. This movie is not for the young and easy to scare people because it has these unexpected horrific scenes that scare the living daylights out of you.The fact that exorcism has always existed in real life makes you wonder if this movie is based on some form of reality and that is what makes it even scarier. The acting is superb and everything about this movie is great. Yes it is a horror/ drama but I think you can't have a horror without a good base/ storyline.",10,2,3,2 January 2018
