The Ring," Blissful horror....
","One can safely comment that this movie is absorbing and highly entertaining..The concept that the viewing of a videotape leads to a certain death 7 days later and the struggle to prevent such demise in the meantime while time is steadily running out attracts the attention and interest of the viewer who is captured by the charm of the dark life threatening secret from the first scene and is not released until the end or long after it even...The acting is solid ,the characters behavior not always 'smart' but believable , the visual effects convincing ,the atmosphere impressive and it maintains both the agony and the guesswork in your mind active throughout.'Im scared but i love it ' would be an accurate description of the experience. I wont reveal the exact plot but i will make a couple of general comments on it so if you belong to the category of viewers that don't wish to know anything about the storyline don't read any further.The first observation is that the actual killings are not shown while committed .This 'just before and after' approach which is handled well gives the film a less bloody profile and effectively helps to remove of it the label of 'another horror movie' since bloodbaths have become very much a cliché that provokes disgust but not necessarily fear. But is the movie a thriller proper? Well , if you expect at the end of it to leave the movie theatre with all the answers you will be a little bit disappointed.As in most movies that employ the supernatural as part of the explanation more questions than the ones answered are created and that for me is not a triviality.. If on the other hand you are not bothered with such approaches you can be sure that you will be in happy agony for 2 hours .It is certain that you wont regret your choice to see this otherwise impressive piece of film making. i would rate it 7.5/10",7,0,0,21 February 2003
Shutter Island," Eerie but lacking...
","No need to write a comprehensive review as details of the plot etc can be found elsewhere and i don't like spoilers. Di Caprio's acting is as good as usual and the rest of the cast do pretty well ( Michelle Williams being the almost sad exception).The production values are high , still the film is not as convincing as it should/could have been. The element of surprise is somehow weakened by some elements that 'warn' the experienced viewer of what will eventually folllow. The obvious of some observations or conclusions prevents you from really identify with the main character in his emotions and approach. In some scenes the characters appear pretentious or simplistic . The film is also ridden with many thriller/horror clichés. And is it just me or is it the case that some plot holes or loose ends are not covered/ answered sufficiently in the end? Bottomline : If in view of the high ratings you are expecting to see a film in par with say seven or the sixth sense , you need to lower your expectations. It's the only way to enjoy it fot what it is. A no brainer entertaining thriller suitable for a rainy winter night.",7,1,3,30 August 2010
Schindler's List," A superb 2/3 movie...
","This is one of the most successful attempts of Spielberg to create his masterpiece and it's just off the mark..It suffers from what appears to haunt most Spielberg's efforts that is the 2/3 syndrome.For almost two hours the movie is appropriately realistic raw even and its plot is clever and absorbing .The acting is mostly top class especially from Neeson who balances superbly between shroudness and kindness and Ralph Fieness who incarnates the brutality and insanity of the third Reich and considers Jews subhumans. The cinematography is wonderful as usual and the camera work exemplary.The anti war message is conveyed in a strong shocking manner as is the message for human compassion in the middle of the holocaust.Similar qualities graced 'The empire of the sun' .But as it happened in that movie as well , the balance gradually gets lost.Not due to miscalculation but due to a conscious submission to the melodramatic ...The public gets what the public wants? Maybe from a commercial point of view Spielberg's approach is more appealing to the patriotic or peace loving audience that loves the melodramatic. Not so if you belong to the group of people that don't like art to be reduced to a preaching to the converted.Not if you consider realism a virtue in this type of films.Not if you don't like mellow approaches. You can't fault the first two thirds of the movie.The movie is as it is exceptional, but not a masterpiece, by choice..I admire Spielberg for what he can create and has partly created but not what he chose to do to the end of potentially one of the best movies of all times for definitely non artistic reasons.. 7.5 out of 10 (10/10 for the first two thirds and 3/10 for the rest)",7,1,3,16 March 2003
Black Hawk Down," Realistic enough but ultimately not absorbing....
","The battle scenes that are the major part of the film look more real and less 'heroic' than most Hollywood productions.At times a raw anti war rather than patriotic message is conveyed. This is good in my book. The main problem is that the character build up is lacking and the viewer is not given the opportunity to identify with any of them.And that is a crucial shortcoming ..You don't get to know them ,you don't get to feel for them....The acting itself is sufficient for supporting acts but no performance is particularly strong.The whole experience of watching this film is not a waste of time, but it leaves a lot to be desired.If you are a fan of no nonsense, non epic war films you can proceed. With caution....",6,0,1,14 March 2003
Pulp Fiction," Perverted cinematic perfection
","This is a superb movie and definitely one of my favorites of all time.The action is intense and highly entertaining, the characters cool but mortal, the acting close to perfect by an all star cast that shines throughout ,the dialogues  clever and Tarantino's disturbed genius provides a cinematic spectacle not to be missed by any fan of the art.The film has everything except from 'true love'.You can find the non stop struggle to survive or to gain power and money ,sex ,drugs, rock and roll,an instantly 'classic' dance scene,moral dilemmas,clever back and forth plot twists even touches of distorted romance and existential concerns.The pace ranges from slow to frantic..   Maybe there is too much violence for the conservative viewer.But who needs conservatism when it comes to judging art? The creative madness of the gifted director in this gangster film combines humor , coolness , realism and an almost cartoonish at times surrealism accompanied by a suitable soundtrack that contributes immensely to the whole larger than life atmosphere.The heroes are likeable and their strengths and weaknesses despite their seemingly cool behavior are exposed in their moments of glory and decline (not necessarily in a chronological order) in a masterful manner. Chance can determine their fate and nobody is above the realities of a cruel merciless world in their quest for well, hedonism rather than happiness...No faults,just sheer cinematic enjoyment for the open minded cinema lover..10 out of 10...",10,1,2,3 March 2003
Wedding Crashers," Come on...
","OK ,i did find the premise interesting , but come on, the acting is frequently over the top, the characters reactions extreme and unbelievable and so is the ease by which the central heroes 'score' with women looking better than top models, as well as their total 'immunity' to the occasionally 'out of this world' beauty and heavenly figure of some of their 'victims' until the 'right' one comes along...Needless to say that despite it's somewhat original premise ,the film is ridden with clichés and of course a cheesy 'happy' end...The movie tries hard to not be too sleazy, but sleazy enough for teenagers but the result is not so attractive... On the other hand, there are some clever lines and funny scenes and likable protagonists. Overall though unconvincing and unsatisfactory and therefore, overrated...",6,4,6,3 January 2007
The Shawshank Redemption," Good but overrated...
",My impression is that since the early ninenties and especially  after 'green fried tomatoes' was released movies regarding human relations and/or tragedy and using narative as their spine became fashionable..Countless movies followed that i dont care to mention most of them inferior than the original they tried to follow and one of them is Shawshank redemption.Sure it is not a mellow love story but about life in prison that is objectively hard.But somehow the typical ingredients are there.The film is mostly sad and melodramatic and one can even consider it romantic in a way.Despite its strong cast and a good storyline it does not avoid all these characteristic cliches that sadly deprive it from any real replay value.Rent it on dvd and you wont be disapointed by viewing it but the second best movie of all times it aint and you will know this because you wont feel the need to watch it now and then as it happens at least to me  with movies that are really classics...Not a bad movie but highly overrated....3 out of five stars.,6,2,5,3 March 2003
Amélie," European cinema at it's delightful best...
","This light extremely pleasant movie is full of virtues.The European artistic approach is more than obvious in each scene where every single detail is planned, the colors are superb,the soundtrack by Tiersen excellent with some of the most memorable music accompanying a film you'll ever hear (i actually bought the soundtrack BEFORE seeing the film)and the acting is funny and convincingly 'cute' in a way that only the french can achieve...The movie as a whole is a beautiful fairy tale executed in a witty manner by people who enjoy what they are doing with imagination and faith .And the end result is sheer cinematic magic to anybody who is ready to watch with an open heart and mind.A journey into the beauty of a young woman's 'soul' and the dreamlike clarity of her world-view. It's as if Amelie sheds her light to everybody and everything surrounding her rendering them interesting to the viewer as part of her world.Nothing groundbreaking, or dramatic or really 'important' happens in the film..But the plot can't be criticized.Nor the depth factor if we want to be fair...The movie is after all and in all it's immense artistic beauty a ( somewhat romantic)comedy .The dialog and narration are very witty as is the surprise ending.And as in other European movies artistic references are also present. The effort to understand the inner emotions of a girl in portrait by Renoir is an obvious example.Asking for more would probably be something similar to asking more salt in a cake... So is it perfect? Well to me in it's genre is as close to cinematic perfection as anyone ever reached.The replay value of the movie is also very high .You will go back to it from time to time.All in all a solid 10/10.Enjoy without reservations...",10,0,2,13 April 2003
