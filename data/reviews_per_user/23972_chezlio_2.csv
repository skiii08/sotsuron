10 Cloverfield Lane," Almost Perfect
","I'm not going to write about the story in detail because it's a good one and pretty well told. It keeps you cringing and grinding your teeth, sometimes uneasy, at other times happily relieved. And there is some seriously good acting too! I only think that it should have ended on Michelle's discovery of the truth. Right after she sees 'IT' above the field. She should end on 'You must be kidding me'. BAM! Credits. It would have been, in my opinion, the perfect ending. Leaving the viewer aghast, jaw dripping, thinking: 'I didn't see that coming'. Instead the whole mood of the story suddenly changes and makes Michelle the female Lethal Weapon... it's a bit ridiculous, embarrassing even.who said you can't stop on a high note? Check out the movie REC for an idea of the perfect ending.",9,0,1,29 November 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," Marvel super heroes... only without the story
","This movie is simply not a movie... it's a music video without the music. Big images of impossible landscapes, characters that are caricatures without an inch of depth. I left the theater after an hour. The street outside was more interesting.It didn't start well: I tire of the superhero-type with eyes that can see behind his back and the sensory equipment of a feline. Then it got worse, the impossible landscapes that looked so good in Avatar or Star Wars seem completely out of place in the post-apocalyptic world of Mad Max. I mean Mad Max, the Road Warrior! That felt real, a world with people fighting for petrol and survival! Mad Max : Fury Road is way off the reality chart. Whoever came up with the world must have come straight out the video game industry. The visual effects are unbelievable (literally): they look fake. Some scenes inside the truck look so off that it's impossible to get caught by the story (or its absence in this occurrence). If you want to see an impossible crazy movie with no story at all but depth of characters try Jan Kounen's Dobermann. At least the characters are interesting. Well... here stops the bashing. Spending more time on it would be an either greater waste of the time I've spent on this movie. Cheers and good luck watching it if you do.Did anybody else found the dude with the electric guitar completely out of place?",2,24,47,14 August 2015
