The Devil's Advocate," Devil meets devil euhm...lawyer
","I was really curious about this movie. Not only because Al Pacino is one of my favorite actors but also because the subject made me curious. There have been quite a few 'devil movies', so I wondered why another one? What can this one offer that the others couldn't? The answer is quite simple... another side of the devil: his human side. Pacino does a great job portraying the devil and learns us that there is a bit of the devil in all of us. But in the end we can choose our own path and destiny. It is also the end of the movie that I will always remember because it wasn't the usual (clich√©) ending you get to see in so many thrillers. This movie is a must see for everyone who loves Pacino, but also for people who like to see a bit more than just the average thriller because this one is a lot more than just that! Also worth mentioning is the great performance of Charlize Theron in the role of Kevin's (Keanu) wife, Mary Ann.",Null,0,1,4 January 2001
