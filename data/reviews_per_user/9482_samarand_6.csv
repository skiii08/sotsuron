The Blair Witch Project," Not so much, not so little
","When I was in high school I had a classmate whose boyfriend made amateur horror movies. I never got to see them, but those who did said they were awful. When I first heard of The Blair Witch Project and the way it had been made, I expected something like that; so, since I did not expect much, the fact that I liked it probably doesn't mean much anyway. I didn't think it was brilliant, but I did like it. I found it well done: the pseudo-documentary feel does not slip up in any glaring way, and I can see why some of the people who saw it first could not believe it was fake. The off-kilter camera and the unpolished look only adds to its plausibility. Also, the dialogue probably will not enter any intelligence contest, but you have to agree that if people in that situation started reciting sage lines, that would not be very believable. Anyway it is no worse than some lines I've heard in movies supposed to be 'high art.' And, although I cannot say I felt very scared (except by the ending, maybe), the movie does have an eerie atmosphere that is very unsettling.The format of the movie itself does have a problem: it does seem odd that they should keep on shooting images, even after things are beginning to unravel. Heather's explanation about this being the only thing left to them sounds silly, simply because we know the real explanation, that is, that if they did not keep the camera going, there would not be any movie anyway. The explanation about how the map gets lost is completely ridiculous: if they had said that the Blair Witch had grabbed it in person it would have been more believable. But taking it as a whole my opinion is positive. I think that the best thing to do about this movie is forget the hype, remember that this is NOT a Hollywood megabudget production and that there are NO special effects, and try to judge the movie on its merits. It is neither a complete disaster nor the best thing invented after pizza. It is just a clever little movie.",Null,0,1,5 May 2000
Sleepy Hollow," Wow!
","I suppose any comment from me will be suspect, because I usually like Tim Burton's movies (even Mars Attacks!, 'nuff said!). I went to see this movie because it was by Burton: I like Washington Irving's stories in general, but I always considered Sleepy Hollow as a rather stupid story. Just in case you loved the movie and wish to check out the book, I say, well, don't. If I remember correctly in the story Ichabod Crane is a highly irritating schoolmaster, Katrina is a stolid but good-looking future Hausfrau, and Brom is just like in the movie, only it's he who gets the girl in the end. The screenplay by Andrew Kevin Walker (he of Se7en), very intelligently turns the story into a fairy-talish comic-horror whodunit, Ichabod into an all-questioning detective whose superiors can't wait to get rid of, and Katrina into a smart witch apprentice. Johnny Depp plays his Ichabod with comic zest, Christina Ricci proves once again to be a quite talented young lady, and the rest of the cast is also excellent, including a stunning Christopher Walken as the Hessian Horseman (in an uncredited appearance, I believe), and  Christopher Lee and Martin Landau also shine in small parts. The Gothic-Old Flemish atmosphere is superb. This is quite the movie for you if you like your movies to be unusual and unpredictable.",10,3,4,16 March 2000
American Beauty," Ugly, cheap and yet moving
","'American Beauty' is the name of a kind of rose that doesn't have either thorns or scent. As such, it stands as a symbol of Lester's life, a life without peril (other than being threatened by the possibility of being laid off by a kid half his age), but also without charm or passion. The ways in which Lester seeks to escape such a life may strike us as puerile, but the fact is they are not important. The important thing is the call for personal freedom, and the refusal to live according to unacceptable standards simply in exchange of pretty things, like a big house, a neat garden and an Italian silk sofa.The characters are all certainly clichÃ©s, but nevertheless they come through as real people: the fact that we have seen the man suffering a middle-age crisis, the unsatisfied wife, the beautiful but empty headed beauty queen, the disciplinarian marine, etc. in a hundred movies doesn't mean that such people doesn't exist in real life, and unlike other such movies, they are not presented to us here as beasts with curious habits to be shocked about, or as caricatures to be laughed at, but essentially as human beings that deserve our compassion. They are not heroes: like the flying plastic bag, they are ugly and cheap, but they are ultimately moving and poetic.The performances are all brilliant, especially Kevin Spacey's: he wins all our sympathy, something that is not as easy as you may suppose, since his character's embarrassing and cheap side is shown to us in all its ridiculous glory. I don't know if he'll win the Oscar (which after all is mostly about studio politics), but his is one of the best performances I have seen in the last years. A few small sillinesses of the movie (such as Lester spitting his beer when he hears that Angela is going to spend the night in his house, or the Marine watching old Reagan movies) are not bad enough to spoil the general effect. I must say it is nice to see a movie that tells us how precious and unique life is, and does that without pouring the saccharine in. Hope it starts a trend.",10,0,0,24 February 2000
Event Horizon," Intriguing concept, but flawed results
","This movie is certainly not big in originality: most of its components are filched from different other sources, most notably the alien life force that probes the minds of humans and uses their guilty feelings against them, featured in Stanislav Lem's book Solaris (or maybe the movie based in it). This doesn't prevent it from being quite entertaining and indeed very scary, until more or less the middle, when suddenly the movie is plunged into sloppiness. It is as if they reached a certain point and didn't know very well how to go on from there. It is a pity, because this much inferior second part completely spoils the movie's effectiveness.",Null,0,0,28 February 2000
There's Something About Mary," The problem is, it is not funny
","This movie must have something I'm illiterate about, because I cannot see the reason for all the fuss. When the movie ended I realized I hadn't laughed a single time, and since this is labeled as a comedy, this is bad, right? Before you start wondering if I am the kind of person who only gets laughs out of Woody Allen, let me tell you that I did laugh with, say, Beavis and Butthead Do America, so gross comedy is not a problem with me. The problem isn't the movie's very low-brow, or its highly-touted political incorrectness (which after all is pretty harmless), the problem is the jokes' timing. Even if you hadn't been told the jokes already, you could see them coming from a mile away, and then they are stretched out beyond breaking point. The best thing about this movie is Cameron Diaz, who proves to be an able and charismatic comedian, and not simply a 'bombshell.' She manages to convince us that there is indeed 'something' about a Mary who otherwise is not very remarkable.",2,1,2,28 February 2000
The Matrix," Good action, bland metaphysics
","The awe the subject of this movie inspired on audiences must be the proof that nobody reads serious science-fiction anymore. If they did, they would already be very familiar with the subject of virtual reality, including virtual reality used to mask an unbearable truth. Also, they would have seen it presented in a definitely more profound manner. If you think about it the holes of the concept become evident, and the fact that our heroes are able to manipulate the Matrix to a point does take a lot of bite from it. However, I can't say I didn't enjoy this movie. Even if it isn't as highly metaphysical as some people seem to believe, it is still a good action movie, and, considering what passes for sci-fi in movies these days, it is rather nice to see a movie that, even if it is not serious science-fiction, at least more or less tries to resemble it.",Null,0,0,1 November 2000
