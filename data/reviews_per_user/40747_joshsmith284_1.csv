Angels & Demons," Good but not as good as the book!
","I would of given this film a better review had I watched it before reading the book, but considering how much is missed out in the film version I can't rate this any higher. There were so many key bits missed out in the film that really frustrate me but the things that actually are in there are done well. I highly recommend this film if you have not read the book but if you have I'm warning you now, YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED. Now the bad points are out of the way I'll focus on the good parts. The acting was very good in my opinion and Tom Hanks especially as Robert Langdon, gets my plaudits. The film is executed very well and the key story-line is consistent throughout so I have no issues with that.Again I will stress though, IF YOU HAVE READ THE BOOK YOU MAY BE DISAPPOINTED, but if you haven't it is a very good film which keeps you thinking all the way through!",8,0,1,9 February 2014
