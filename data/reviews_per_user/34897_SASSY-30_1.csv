The Blair Witch Project," So good I think I will see it again (unless I talk myself back to sanity)
",I thought the movie was in a different league than what we consider a normal 'scary movie.'  When I left the theater I though 'well that was different.' I didn't think it was really scary until I was at home alone in the dark. Yikes!  I couldn't sleep even with my lights on.  So if you live alone you may consider having a friend or family sleep over - it helps.So the next time you are all alone in the dark - think - are you really alone????,Null,1,1,27 July 1999
