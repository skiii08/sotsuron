Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Flawed, but worth seeing
","I just saw 'Phantom Menace' and have to agree with a lot of the basic consensus on the film.  The special effects were outstanding, and I was thrilled to see the huge amount of light saber action in this film.  The set designs were a wonderful eyeful of imagination and art.  Also, the movie held that 'Star Wars' kind of magic - irresistibly exciting and eventful.Some flaws:1.  This episode lacked the ominous sense of evil the others had.  The main dark presence, Darth Maul, was barely a character (he seemed more out of WWF or a violent video game).2.  I didn't feel like rooting much for any of the good characters; they simply weren't developed well.  For a character who's going to be in the next two, Obi-Wan remains a dull mystery.  I side with those who didn't particularly like young Anakin (or at least, Lloyd's acting) - he came off as a cocky  kid and his line-delivery was rather strained and whiny.  Portman, Neeson, and McGregor were formidable, but boring.  I don't even want to go into the annoying inclusion of Jar Jar Binks (I couldn't understand a word he said and just wanted him to go away).3.  The tempo of the movie was very inconsistent.  At times, scenes passed too slowly and I couldn't wait until they were over. Although exciting at first, the pod race scene became tedious after a few minutes. At other times, the scenes were too frenetic and fast-paced and I found it difficult to keep up with the action. The political subplot was distracting and confusing, and I craved more scenes with the Jedi Counsel (Yoda!!).See it, but remember it's an entertaining event movie, not necessarily a 'great' one.",7,4,6,19 May 1999
