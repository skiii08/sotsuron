Sucker Punch," WTF did I just watch
","Skateboard! Video Game! I hate my parents! Rap remix classic songs! Zombie Nazi super ninja! Power Puff Girl Power! Tits and Ass! Robots! Adults just don't understand! Emo Bad Ass....eh I give up. Sucker Punch is visually stunning, but takes itself so seriously in every other respect that it fails on story, character development, plot, etc. Take aspects from all popular video games and put them all together at once with 'punk'-wannabe versions of songs...in every scene. Little girl is a poor victim that no one understands or bothers to help and is utterly helpless. But no, she is an ultra super bad-ass that is invincible with mad ninja fighting skills. But she's special, and attractive, a unique snowflake, so no explanation is necessary. I get the swaps between 'reality' and fantasy, but they make no sense. A quiet swap of a map is portrayed by compressing every WWII, Vietnam, and Terminator war movie into five minutes. The unbeatable enemy is after me! One slow-mo back-flip dragged to two full minutes equals sudden defeat for no reason. I don't know what the f**k I'm trying to say, but I make a hell of a lot more sense than Sucker Punch. I can't believe each character doesn't have three iPhones. It looks great though. Girl Power!!",5,1,3,20 August 2011
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," I like funny, but this ain't it
","How this movie has such a high rating so far I have no idea. I'm guessing IMDb has been taken over by 14 year olds. I didn't expect comedy redefined or anything, but I certainly expected Will Ferrell to make me laugh! This was pretty bad. it would have been absolutely worthless without my boy, Steve Carrell. The reviewer describing this as an 'alum' movie had it right; these guys weren't even trying. There were a few (5?) pretty good laughs, but this flick needed to be put down and sent to the glue factory. If I could go back in time to when I was asking for the tickets I would have asked for another movie. Okay that line was forced, but this has to be 10 lines. And Anchorman doesn't really deserve 10 lines of commentary.",3,3,6,11 July 2004
