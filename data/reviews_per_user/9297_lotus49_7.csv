Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," 4 Down, 5 Still to Go.. Give me Strength, oh Dark One!!
","You'll have to take these comments with a grain of salt, because I was one of the only people I know my age who didn't like the first Star Wars when it first came out. I'm therefore no longer in the target age group nor among the nostalgia seekers that Lucas is counting on to make his mega billions to finance 2 more of these fiascos (obviously he got my money anyway!). Every generation needs myths but even myths should be coherent. There are lot of good small sci fi movies that came out in the period of the first trilogy (Silent Running, Blade Runner, Alien come to mind), which provide the homage and class to the dark prescience displayed by the best of this genre. This movie is pure fantasy, propelled by pretentious moral overtones and special effects overdone to point of pure monotony. An earlier reviewer proposed this film should be viewed as an old Saturday Matinee Serial, with a complete suspension of belief, but even the Republic Serials had a tongue in cheek, self deprecating humour and irony about them. That's all lost in the sheer pompous self delusion of this movie. I wouldn't be so critical if it weren't for the fact that Star Wars and the other money besotted megaliths have skewed the business and dried up the funding for smaller sci fi films which engage the intellect instead of plastering the senses.",Null,0,1,14 June 1999
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Preserving and Protecting our Precious Bodily Fluids..
","I would not have expected this film to age well, since its vocabulary and characters are so quintessentially made of Cold War material. It takes a bit of suspension of current reality and a good memory to get all the gags, but Kubrik's consummate attention to detail and methodical plot and character development still makes this a completely enjoyable black comedy. The humour in this movie is attended by a chill, as one realizes how very close to reality the fanatic red baiting of General Ripper or the clinical warmongering of General Turgidson are to the fact of the times. Strangelove himself is a peculiar dramatic construct reflecting the outrageous rationalizations of the Cold War gone completely over the deep end. The film is a little overextended in its comedy in parts, moving from intellectual satire, to sight and name puns, to some really obtuse character sketches. The great scenes inside the B52, though, or the battle sequence, which look like completely authentic newsreel footage, and the stark cinemetography of the War Room,  shows you what a perfectionist and what a finely crafted product this great film maker put out.",Null,2,4,18 July 1999
Predator," An action film that is both simple and fun
","Somehow this pared down to basics action flik works. It builds on a very simple premise of hunted men and keeps a steady tension, good visual effects, some great action and one liners. It shows that you need not have a convoluted plot or over the edge fireworks to produce a completely enjoyable action film.",Null,0,0,30 November 1998
Paths of Glory," A milestone of film history
","I'm not sure Kubrik ever surpassed himself in this passionate, angry indictment of the absurdity of war. The slow methodical unfolding of the inevitable tragic conclusion of this film.. in order to protect the vanity and careers of the incompetent generals is dense in its portrayal of human failings and cruelty in the commission of war. General Mireau's response to Dax's ultimate outrage and accusation of the injustice is so stunning in its brevity, sophistry and sheer careless self righteousness that one feels at a loss to answer it. The final scene of the young German girl singing in the tavern to Dax's troops before they are sent back to the front is among the most moving in all cinema.",Null,0,0,18 July 1999
The Thin Red Line," ingredients are there.. maybe too few cooks spoil the broth
","There were times, while i was watching this film, that I thought it was going to break through into a truly great, cerebral and subjective perspective on War.. in a class with Das Boot. It somehow got a little too wrapped up in its poetic aspirations, though. The acting is very good, the cinematography is great, the characters are interesting and authentic, but somehow the chemistry just doesn't mix. A better editing job (shortening and simplifying it) would have helped, a more cohesive plot line focussed on fewer characters. The final scene of the defeat of the Japanese, showing them begging and pleading, looks ridiculous to anyone who knows of the grim and stoic determination of the Japanese soldiers in the Pacific theatre. It does, I think, capture the fog of war for the common grunt, its story line is not contrived like Saving Private Ryan, it really is an idea and film that could have worked, but missed..",Null,0,0,8 July 1999
Gladiator," Yeah lot's of problems- but on the Big Screen- Total Entertainment!!
","A quite impressive take on the Roman epic, but very Hollywood. By that I mean it uses cliches of celebrity heroes pandering to cheering audiences and slimey bad guys, both without much complexity or shading, and a fairly predictable plot. Ridley hasn't really tested our intelligence since Blade Runner (if you don't include the 1984 Mac Intro Super Bowl Commercial). Still the visuals are stunning, the dialogue at least bordering on eloquence at times. The battle and forum scenes are terrific even with the enervating slo mo's and some apparent computer generated enhancements.  It's the type of film that you can see with your father as a kid and remember for the rest of your life, which makes up for whatever it lacks in sophistication. ABSOLUTELY necessary to see this on a large screen, with a 'big' sound system.",Null,0,0,2 June 2000
Goodfellas," A gangster film with a definite element of reality
","The Godfather series never rang completely true, with its glamorized portrayal of noblesse oblige within the criminal underworld. GoodFella's does with its portrayal of petty criminals and psychopaths who's noblesse is completely self serving and without compassion in dealing with anything that comes in their way. Deniro and Pesci are brilliant in their roles as wise guys (sociopath and psychopath respectively). Ray Liotta is good as a small time hood with a bit of heart who deals drugs and turns informer. His role is probably more sympathetic than is the real Henry Hill on whom the character is based, but it does provide an emotional bridge for the audience into a world of brutality, retribution, greed and treachery. A very well constructed movie.",Null,0,0,30 November 1998
