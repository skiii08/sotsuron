Alien 3," Don't know why this gets the hate it gets
",No weapons. Trapped with the worst prisoners. An alien is on the loose. Love this sequel. Is it the original or Aliens? No. Don't buy into the hype by critics. Give it a chance. Nicely paced as well.,8,0,1,4 April 2020
Rocketman," Superb!!
","Loved the fact that they didn't stick to the straightforward biopic formula. Acting was incredible. Two hours was a perfect running time. Highly recommended!! You felt his agony. Boy, this was great!!",10,2,3,11 August 2019
The Irishman," Incredible piece of filmmaking.
","Scorsese at his best. Unlike Casino, it's not a carbon copy of Goodfellas (for the most part) in terms of story telling. He's the best at telling stories of those who cross into the world of illegal acts. 'Goodfellas' level quality. The anti-aging is a little off putting at the beginning. But after the first couple of passes you get used to this. Great to see Pesci back at it again. Pacino is excellent. Deniro is excellent. You don't like any of the characters or see humor in their portrayals. You actually hate them for what they do. They are cold blooded killers or ruthless thieves.This is a dense, long movie. But man, it's well worth the time. Hope they release it as a stand-alone Blu Ray release. Heavy on dialogue at times but it keeps you riveted. 3 1/2 hours. Highly recommended. 10/10.",10,5,13,29 November 2019
Aquaman," DC finally equals Marvel
",Great action. Great story. Not a slow moment. A+++,10,3,7,1 January 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," I Don't Know What Movie You All Saw But...
","The Rise of Skywalker was incredible! Action, lots of action!! For those who said they couldn't follow the story, you're dopey!! Great twists and no hackney, corny dialogue. You want lightsaber fights? There's a truckload!! You want Force Power on display? Yup! Not a wasted moment. You will love it! Do not listen to the critics. They are twisted shut-ins who never created anything in their lives. A nice final epic. 17 out of 10.",10,10,32,22 December 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," See it in 3D!!!
",Loved this movie. Great action. 3D was awesome since it's in cartoon format. Will go see it again.,10,35,65,14 December 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Might be one of the most tedious movies I've seen since 'HAIL CAESER'
",Don't waste your time or $$$. It's a slow 2.5 hour death march. Boring from start to finish. I really would give this a '0' if allowed. Margot Robbie. Would have been nice to see her more. A hard pass...,1,4,10,23 November 2019
Joker," Will be seeing this again..
","This movie was in your face and violent. Did it 'borrow' from Taxi Driver, King of Comedy and Requiem for a Dream. It absolutely did. Some direct ripoffs. But a great movie. Joaquin Phoenix was amazing. Not for the kiddies whatsoever. This ain't a DC movie. It takes shape at the end in reference to the DC mythology. 10/10. A+++.",10,2,4,5 October 2019
It Chapter Two," Almost...
",Should have had more Pennywise. He's the 'E' ticket of the movie. Somewhat disjointed flow. Too much relying on jump scares as opposed to building tension. This is a lazy film trick used as a crutch used in most every modern day horror movie. If they cut 30-40 minutes from the almost 3 hour running time and tightened the narrative it would have been a 10. It's longer than The Godfather. There is a tad bit of meandering in the second act of the movie. That could have been easily cut. The final act seemed very rushed. Like they realized the movie was going to be over 3 hours and they just pulled the plug. I may enjoy it more the more I see it but I have a few reservations.,7,3,6,7 September 2019
Annihilation," Loved it!
",Loved the weirdness of this movie. Great piece of film making..,8,1,4,27 May 2018
