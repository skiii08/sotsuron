The Blair Witch Project," rubbish
","if you go to see this film expecting to be scared forget it. its dire,its got nothing going for it.the only reason it did so well is people listening to all the hype then going to see it. its one of the worst films i have seen,plan 9 from outer space was more entertaining ,if you like a good night at the cinema this is not it",1,49,96,21 November 2000
