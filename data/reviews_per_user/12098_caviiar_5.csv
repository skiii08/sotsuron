The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Mocking Moviegoers - What a Horrible Movie
","The screenwriter team for this movie was obviously under pressure to extend beyond reason the simplistic narrative of this movie. The result: over two hours of acting without substance. I cannot complain about the actors, for they did what they were paid to do, but COME ON, did it have to be so melodramatic and empty? Emotions are simply not credible, and only inspire scorn.I want my money back. I want my time back. What a waste of effort to extend this film beyond one installment. Had they compacted the movie in 1 hour, then probably all the bad cinematography would have been eliminated.Sure producers will make a profit at the expense of unsuspected viewers and several (perhaps demolishing) hits on actors careers. I will NOT view the last installment. I refuse to give my money away for nothing.The saddest part is that this movie could have been great. The acting talent was there. Technical resources were available. But he most inexpensive part of the production was neglected beyond belief: storytelling. The screenwriters in this movie are not idiots. It is obvious that artificial constraints were placed to extend the story to two parts.SAVE YOUR TIME, SAVE YOUR MONEY, DO NOT WATCH THIS BAD, BAD MOVIE.",1,176,313,6 December 2014
Insidious," Crunch time
","Normally I review very good or really, really bad movies. This falls in the good category. We have to admit that making an original movie is specially difficult; there are too many common places, and while this movie visits quite a few of them, it introduces twists and surprises that takes you unprepared.The initial scene only makes sense once you have watched the last one, bringing the whole tale full-circle. The high-pitch music delivered with the initial title and then repetition with the closing title have devastating effects on your nerves. The depth of the title becomes more and more apparent as the final credits roll. Slowly you start thinking 'that was an insidious b...'. The execution of this film is superb.This is not to say that the movie is without flaws. There are several lost opportunities, and towards the end some of the carefully crafted eeriness dissolves... but only for a moment. This movie is a great piece that honors a crowded genre.",9,9,18,30 March 2011
Avatar," What a weak plot!
","WHAT A WEAK PLOT!!!! Too much hype for this movie. Yes, it has impressive special effects... and that is about it. The protagonist has a problem with authority (always an asset in teenager movies), is saved by the princess of the 'others', becomes accepted into the 'others', and in less than three months does everything better than the natives AND the PhDs who spent decades training. The essence of the anecdote, of course, is that this punk kisses the girl, saves the planet, and becomes king. WT#. W.T.#.! After spending tens of millions in special effect, Cameron could have spent just a few thousand in a decent screenplay; or, for that matter, he could have gotten a better one for free. About the world, this movie simply adds an extra pair of something to all animals: horses with six legs, birds with four wings, beasts with four eyes; makes you wonder about the love scene. Watching this movies is unavoidable if you are into sci-fi, or just an avid moviegoer. However, while Avatar provides visual entertainment, it is clearly the weakest and sloppiest screenplay in all Cameron's movies; the end result is a disappointing experience. You have been warned: watch it enjoy the visual feast, but PLEASE, do not come out saying this is the best movie ever.",1,9,28,10 January 2010
Lucy," Excellent Sci-Fi Movie
","This movie truly is a masterpiece of science fiction, that is, it fictionalizes what happens if the limits of science are expanded. And it does that at a carefully measured pace. I was surprised that many 'critics' (i.e. parasites of opinion that compete for the meanest words to retain readers) point quickly to the inaccuracy of the science behind Lucy, but they do not care to point to the physical impossibility of let say Captain America. This is not your average Marvel movie... it is much better. There is the sexy girl, the exciting action scenes, and some profound questions without trying to give mystical answers. You can just sit down, relax, and enjoy an action sci-fi flick that is outside the predictable and formulaic Hollywood bunch (some of which I also enjoy greatly). This movie is a refreshing view on an old topic. There are many cultural references in this movie (to movies, arts, science, the crown of french archaeological findings, etc.) that you might miss if you do not pay enough attention; even if you do, you need to have vast knowledge to pick them all up. I am sure I missed many. For example, there is an elegant reference to Michelangelo's 'The Creation of Adam', and another clever fundamental scene with Lucy drinking water happens in what looks like Gorges de l'Ard√®che, where the Cahuvet Cave guards the oldest human paintings. Pay attention to the statue destroyed at the University. Perhaps many references are unintentional, and simply reflect the spirit of our time. In any case, Lucy takes you on a ride that will last long after the lights are back on. LUCY IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",10,33,69,13 August 2014
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Dark of the Movies: What a waste of time and money (mine, of course)
","There is no redemption for this movie. It is by far the worse in the series. LaBeouf gives a solid performance and that is about all the movie has to offer. Huntington-Whiteley is beyond plain... a cup of coffee is more expressive than she is. All others are very, very forgettable. This is bad movie because even though there are great special effects, the story sucks big time... too many loose ends, too many undeveloped characters, too many inconsistencies. This is an action movie, and as such we do not expect great psychological complexity; HOWEVER, movie goers are not THAT stupid (learn from e.g. X-men First Class). It feels like the marketing team put too many demands on the story (appeal to this group... and this other... and this other...), and the plot dissolved in thin air. Now all good guys (I mean machines) have thick very identifiable thick accents. I could not tell you how did it all end, because I left by one hour and 50 minutes into the movie. Give my my $10 back! The worst is that time is the most valuable asset a person possesses, for once gone it never can be recovered... I wasted nearly two hours of my life.",2,4,12,1 July 2011
