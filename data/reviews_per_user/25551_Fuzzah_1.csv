Lucky Number Slevin," Fantastic
","It's really one of those movies that grabs you and pulls you in. Though, this isn't a movie you want to go take a break and get a drink or popcorn in. You have to pay full attention or really, the movie is lost. I like this about it, I can see how a lot of people wouldn't however.Josh Hartnett does a very fantastic job in his role and really makes you feel bad that he got stuck in the wrong place at the wrong time. Morgan Freeman and Bruce Willis both do a fantastic job as well. Overall the acting is grand and I think it's a movie everyone should try and see. I think this is going to be one the best movies of 2006 without a doubt.",9,3,12,27 April 2006
