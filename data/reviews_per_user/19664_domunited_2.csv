Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Funny...funny...funny.......
","It is not for prudes. It is not for 'sensitive' types. It is not for the easily offended. It is not for 'up-tight' people. It is not for people who occupy the moral 'high ground'. It is not for people who,in my view, are BORING BORING BORING.It involves testicles (big round ones), drunk people, mad people and, .........., very sane people. It is these sane people who worry me ..... not Sacha.What some people seem to forget is that this is FICTION, it is NOT THE REAL WORLD. He wants to make us LAUGH and he wants to make some MONEY.It is funny.",10,2,13,2 March 2007
Alien," 3 decades old, but it still packs a punch
","Don't forget, this film was made nearly 30 years ago. It was also made 'on the cheap'. When you look at it this way, then you have to say that the results are nothing short of incredible.There is a very short list of films that have a 'haunting' quality - combining undoubted visual treats with a memorable soundtrack.......The Third Man, The Godfather, Don't Look Now, The Shining, to name a few.........and you must add Alien.Alien is memorable for the way in which it takes time to build tension. The landscape is vast, the concept fresh (it is easy now to look back and say that it was not), the special effects are outstanding given the budget, and the acting is first class.This was a massive step forward for both science fiction and horror.",10,1,3,18 May 2007
