Source Code," An original and movie drenched in sagacity
","The majority of films today will either have an idea that they use to compel their story and have originality, or they have an idea not so unheard of but their acting, cinematography, and screenplay will make it easy to overlook. Sometimes they will have half and half or divvy it up, but it's not often that you come across a movie that throws all of it at you at once, yet organizes and flows luxuriously. With Source Code, it seizes your attention with not just action and fast cuts, it makes you excited, it makes you sad and mourn, it takes you to somewhere that puts you in the 'body' of Gyllenhaal as he so effortlessly jumps into the shoes of a confused and real person. He makes it seem as though he was literally put in the position of the movie with no past knowledge, he resembles all of us with the fear, anger, and all emotions that come with being put in the Source Code. In a word this movie is original, yet not just a cool idea, the acting and the techniques used by Duncan make it seem more like the source code already is real, and we are just now learning. The movie is great and I would recommend it to anyone that likes a good movie.",7,2,4,2 October 2015
