Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Best Star Wars Movie
","It beats all the Star Wars movies because 1. Better special effects.2.Great music 3.Better picture quality.You can feel the movie, that's why it's a must-see theater movie. Don't expect a better movie in the next 3 years. George Lucas did it again,but this time it's going to win best picture. The only part I didn't like was Anakin. who was too nice and you couldn't hate him.",10,0,0,20 May 1999
