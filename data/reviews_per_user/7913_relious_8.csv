The Ring," A video tape containing nightmarish images causes anyone who watches it to die in seven days
",The Ring was a great film because I have always liked scary movies and this one happens to be very scary. The effects were really good but the end was kind of fishy but other than that it was a great movie and scared the beans out of me when I first saw it. Naomi Watts Starr's in this movie as well as the award winning King Kong directed by Peter Jackson. The Ring really has a spooky plot and is scary every time I watch it. If you like scary movies than I suggest you see The Ring because it will definitely keep you on the edge of your seat. The plot was excellent and is most certainly a movie I would watch again and again.,8,1,2,23 July 2007
The Bourne Identity," Bourne (Damon) finds his past after a fatal amnesia attack
","This was the best Matt Damon movie I have seen for a long time, this was such a great movie I want to buy twenty copies of it. There's not too much action but there's enough to keep you on the edge of your seat the whole movie. After you plug the DVD in you DVD player you'll not stop till it's over. Matt Damon was in a lot of great movies starting off with The Departed which was great experience too. All in all if you don't have this movie, get it. It is definitely worth watching over and over. This is definitely Matt Damon at his best, the suspense was the thing that kept me watching, if you look away for a moment you will miss something important. Great Movie!",9,2,2,29 January 2008
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Sam and Frodo begin their journey to destroy an evil ring
","This was a great movie, may be just a little long but it's worth sitting through the whole thing. The thing I like most is that Frodo is chosen with the hardest task of all, to destroy the One Ring. The story begins in the shire where Frodo and his gardener Sam live. The wizard Gandalf is sent to warm Frodo of the danger the ring posses. They have to avoid all of the followers of Mordor (where the ring was made) because the ring can only be destroyed in the fires where it was once made. The movie in it's self was a fantastic experience both for me and for my family. The other two conclude the quest for Frodo and Sam. All in all, a great movie and if you don't have it(I doubt you don't) get it.",10,0,0,31 January 2008
Pitch Black," A group of space Marines try to survive on a sun-scorched planet
","Not what you would call my favorite but is very good for the time being. While Pitch Black falls a little bit in the horror section, it is very entertaining. I really liked the action sequences but it seemed that Riddick was held prisoner for almost the whole movie. I really like Vin Diesel in other movies like The Pacifier and of coarse xxxi. This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat and take you on the thrill ride of your life. I really liked this movie because it's scary, but not too scary and definitely has great taste in rock solid action. I thought Vin Diesel was really funny in The Pacifier and liked how he took care of the kids while he was on a mission.",9,3,4,27 July 2007
The Hills Have Eyes," A standard family falls prey to a freakish clan of blood thirsty mutants.
","This was one of my favorite movies, it is definitely one of the scariest, bloodiest that I have seen. If you like blood then watch this, if once is not enough then watch it again. The Hills Have Eyes has great effects and will keep you on the edge of your seat. This movie remind me of the Devil's Rejects because it is just about as bloody. I really think this movie is better than the remake. Another movie it reminds me of is Risident Evil because they are fighting zombies and this movie is pretty much the same thing. I think that it is really cool and advise people who love horror to watch this when given the chance.",7,0,1,3 October 2007
School of Rock," A wanna be rocker poses as a substitute teacher at a prep school and tries to turn the class into a rock-band
","First off, I would like to say that I really enjoyed this movie not only because I am a huge fan of Jack Black but just how great the movie was. It all starts with Miranda Cosgrove, she is my favorite celebrity of all time and I am way too obsessed with iCarly. So, I found out that Miranda Cosgrove was in this movie I immediately wanted to by this movie. So without even seeing it, I went and bout School of Rock and let me tell you this may be the best movie I have ever seen in my entire life. Jack Black is perfect for playing the role of a wanna be rocker, and I also remember Jack Black from the film Kung Fu Panda. Also, the kids all had funny stuff to say throughout the movie, especially Miranda Cosgrove, wow, she was young in that movie. All in all, I am definitely the movie I am going to watch when I am in a bad mood, I'd give it 4 billion stars but there was no option to do so, so I gave it a 10/10 easily. This movie kept me laughing the entire time mainly because Jack Black is such a nut. Miss out on this movie and the jokes on you.",10,0,0,14 September 2009
Fantastic Four," a group of people get caught in a cosmic storm which result in them have superhuman powers
","Fantastic 4 is another great movie if you're in the Marvel company. I have always liked the action sequences and thought all of their powers were cool. Some parts were a little slow a boring but I definitely recommend this movie to any one who loves Marvel comics. Yes Everybody knows Jessica Alba was in other movies that I love. Fantastic 4 has some great action scenes and thought the effects were spectacular. Fantastic 4 has a great ending and is a must see adventure, even though there are a number of awesome things in this movie you will find lots of funny humor. All in all Fantastic 4 is a great movie and should not be missed.",9,1,2,23 July 2007
The Bourne Supremacy," Jason Bourne is framed and is forced to wield the skills of an assassin
","I really liked this movie because for one Mat Damon is a really good actor and have liked him in The Bourne Identity, I think anyone who likes assassins and should give this movie a look. I have really liked assassins and really enjoy these kinds of movies. There is a pretty good amount of violence and probably would not be for children but is good to watch with your friend or so. The first movie was really good I thought because it had really great action through out and who doesn't like action? I know I do and these movies are definitely ones I will watch over and over again. All in all this movie was great and really cant wait for the fourth one.",8,1,3,8 April 2008
