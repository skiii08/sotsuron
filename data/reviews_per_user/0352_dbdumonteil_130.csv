The Devil's Advocate," Satan accepted Kevil Lomax's soul...
","American justice has always been at the heart of many American films. A lot of them have showed lawyers as main protagonists who defend victims with respect of justice. 'The Devil's Advocate' (1997) which presents a new and worthy variation on the myth of Faust exploits an idea we have rarely seen on the screen: a lawyer ready to do anything to succeed, even to defend doubtful cases. Moreover, if the supernatural is an integral part of the whole, we can expect to watch a promising movie. So, here's the story: Keanu Reeves acts a young and ambitious lawyer, Kevin Lomax who can pride himself of not having lost a sole trial throughout his career. One day, he gets in touch with a prestigious law firm in New York run by the charismatic and mysterious John Milton (Al Pacino) who offers him a golden job doubled with a comfortable income. Of course, Lomax doesn't think twice before accepting and so he leaves his natal Florida with her bride Mary-Ann (Charlize Theron) to live in New York. After this, the young lawyer thinks he has reached the top but in the meantime, doubt gnaws away at him until he discovers terrible truths: he has defended criminals, his private life is broken and Milton's real identity will reveal itself before his eyes.If I'm not totally satisfied with 'the Devil's Advocate', it's because I think the outcome is largely telegraphed. Besides, even before seeing the movie, you can guess how it is going to end: the title and especially the cover speak volume about the conclusion: a benevolent Al Pacino taking Keanu Reeves under his wing. In another extent, if I look into the movie's references I realize that they are echoes of 'Angel Heart' (1987) by Alan Parker and the story heavily borrows from 'Rosemary's Baby' (1968) Roman Polanski's masterpiece. Indeed, Charlize Theron's attitude is strongly reminiscent of Mia Farrow's. And just look at the big and somewhat disturbing apartment in which she and Reeves settle. It resembles a lot to the one in 'Rosemary...'. But on the other hand, 'the Devil's Advocate' will influence a few forthcoming movies like 'End of Days' (1999).In spite of all, I don't intend to slag 'the Devil's Advocate' off. The director Taylor Hackford well fulfilled his pledges and delivers, here a well-crafted thriller in spite of the foreseeable nature that clutters it up. As for the scriptwriters, they don't do properly one of their main jobs which is to write a suspenseful script as much as possible. There are also a few holes and one can judge the last images as a little incoherent with the rest of the story. But the authors make up for it by favoring a slow but sure rise of anxiety through Reeves' descent into hell marked out by Theron's progressive madness. And by delaying as much as possible the final revelation, they hold the viewer breathless all the time of the movie. And concerning the dialogs, let's hail some well found cues (I am an humanist!).Among the other qualities we can attribute to Hackford's movie: a good use of secondary characters like Lomax's mother. We could expect her to occupy a decorative part and however her role is indispensable to light and to understand certain points of the story. In another extent, 'the Devil's Advocate' is supported by a very careful photography which confers the movie a strong visual appeal, notably through New York's buildings and the interior of Milton's law firm as big as the devastating corruption which reigns in them. To a second degree, Hackford's movie can be read as a biting denunciation of the American judicial system's abuses and injustices. This critic is directed at unscrupulous lawyers carried away by success and money and ready to defend accused people guilty of a more or less serious offense who are eventually acquitted. In this way, Hackford's bitter critic kicks the bull's eye and at the end of the movie, there's a quite relevant morals which aims a positive objective.At last, about the cast, there's nothing to say about Al Pacino, the role of Satan suits him well and concerning Keanu Reeves, it is his second best performance to date after 'Matrix' (1999). So, 'the Devil's Advocate' (1997) isn't free from shortcomings but the above-mentioned positive aspects are eloquent to make you want to watch this film.",7,1,2,23 February 2005
The Blair Witch Project," Tom Thumb has a picnic at hanging rock.
","This movie,along with 'the sixth sense' and some recent other ones ,is the volte-face of the fantasy and horror genre.The disappearance of these special effects which has been defacing the 'scary movies' since ,say,'the exorcist'.A return to pure psychological suspense.Like Don Siegel 's 'invasion of the body snatchers'(1956),there are here no stars,and a shoestring budget.The form is unique,for it is an amateur camera work,almost a draft,giving the terrible feeling the heroes have really been through it all.The fears we feel in this work recall childhood terrors:the forest,when you are small may be beguiling ,but it's also an unknown world.Who has never been afraid of getting lost in this maze of trees and bushes?That's Tom Thumb syndrome:in the movie,the heroine's map is an equivalent of Tom Thumb's stones.These stones which the three lads find in front of the tent might be a nod in the direction of Charles Perrault;as the (witch's?) house might be a hint at Grimm's 'Hansel and Gretel'.Most of the terror happens in the midday sun:a fantasy and horror movie does not necessarily mean darkness.I would go as far as saying that the scenes in the daylight are the scariest:Peter Weir opened up the way in 1977 with his classic 'picnic at hanging rock'.The three characters 'roaming round this quiet place , waiting for SOMETHING to happen,all this is  extremely disturbing.There's an impending menace,but we do not know exactly what it is,and our fears are  increased tenfold.Strange signs along the way ,a gruesome treasure hunt. At night,the screen becomes sometimes completely black:in all,about five minutes(!),enough to put the spectator in a cold sweat.Like 'picnic at hanging's rock' or'the haunting' (1963),the ending leaves you in front of a huge hole.A movie to treasure.",9,3,8,14 January 2002
The Mask," When I wear this mask, I can be whatever I want...
","A quite important number of movies paid a tribute to Tex Avery's cartoons like 'who framed Roger Rabbit?'. 'The Mask' ranks among them and is a great success, although this movie takes back some characteristics suitable to American movies and particularly this one: the transition for a character from a low level to the degree of hero. Here, the main protagonist (Jim Carrey) is introduced as a clumsy person in the beginning. But the discovery of a weird mask will turn his life upside down and make him become the hero of 'Edge City'. This mask will also allow him to conquer Cameron Diaz's heart and to triumph over a gang who wished to take the city under control.As a consequence, the movie uses a globally thin and convenient screenplay but fortunately, it's compensated by the funny moments where 'the Mask' tops the bill and this is the occasion to intervene a fanciful, but efficient humor that finds again the devastating tone of the cartoons from the forties and the fifties. It also doesn't hesitate in parodying the gangster movies from the thirties and even 'gone with the wind'.Jim Carrey's performance remains one of his best to date. He's well directed and never hams it up unlike the silly 'Ace Ventura in Africa'. Let's add an amusing description of the Kellaway cop (Peter Riegert).A movie eventually entertaining enough to sustain the interest in spite of its weaknesses.",7,1,3,22 April 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," the adventures of the Bride, round 2
","Here comes the Bride again in what was one of the most-anticipated films of 2004 which like its elder brother 'Kill Bill: Vol. 1' (2003) generated much hype. So far, she killed two important enemies (and many more into the bargain) and so erased two names on her list. There are still three left including Bill who will come last.Through its title, 'Kill Bill: Vol. 2' is both a sequel and a non-sequel. The Bride perseveres in her vengeful adventure still related in a chronological disorder but in some chapters or telling flashbacks, Quentin Tarantino reveals us some facts of her past life, notably how she became an expert at martial arts and so how she acquired her knowledge in this domain. Otherwise, this second installment is here to illustrate the famous sentence: 'revenge is a dish best served cold'. And like its elder brother 'Kill Bill: Vol. 1' (2003), it's still painstakingly shot. The composition of every sequence, the way they interlock even the position of the characters. Everything is precise, set in a pedantic manner and filled with neat visual or scenarist ideas. About this, I would like to mention the first sequence, the key one which is the origin of the Bride's bloody, vengeful adventure. It's of course, the famous massacre scene in the church isolated in the desert. Tarantino favored off-camera so we will see almost nothing of it but the sounds of the massacre. Another scene is the fight between Uma Thurman and Daryl Hannah. Tarantino pulls it off with gusto to insert a violent fight in a cramped place which is a trailer. Then like in the great tradition of the film in which two antagonist protagonists confront each other, the filmmaker delays the final, decisive meeting between them until the end and when this moment will arrive, it won't be what the audience will expect in its construction and its evolution.Like in its elder companion, the Bride perseveres in her desire of revenge and its fulfillment and as for Tarantino, he continues in his quest to pay homage to essentially the samurai film and the spaghetti western. Thus, 'Kill Bill: Vol. 2' is filled with cinema-going details, borrowings or influences, here mainly linked to the second cinematographic genre. John Ford and Sergio Leone's worlds are quoted and in another extent, I wonder whether the scene when Budd buries alive the Bride in the ground wasn't influenced by George Sluizier's chilling 'Spoorloos' (1988).But 'Kill Bill: Vol. 2' differs from its elder brother on numerous points. About the influences, if the samurai film was essentially to the fore in the first installment, the second one favors the spaghetti western, would it be only by the scenery and the barren landscapes. And as many users pointed out before, violent fights were the most momentous scenes in 'Kill Bill: Vol. 1', at least the scenes which were the most vivid to the audience. These scenes take a back seat in 'Kill Bill: Vol. 2' in spite of the admirable fight sequence I mentioned above. An increasing psychological tension in the confrontations between the characters reigns during a good part of the movie. Besides, the first sequence which partly showcases a long conversation between the Bride and her worst enemy Bill sets the scene for this chosen perspective. So, action and stunts are relegated to a position of secondary importance to leave the place to long, chatty sequences but Tarantino could have deleted Bill's superfluous words about Superman. Be that as it may, it was maybe the best choice from Tarantino because these long conversations have several functions: to act as a counterbalance to the choreographed action scenes, to unveil the characters' motivations and for the Bride, eloquent bribes of her past.This assumed side from Tarantino to put the accent on the dialogs (very good in most of them) enables to appreciate the performances of the whole cast and this, perhaps more than in the debut opus. Minor characters aren't forgotten and I would grant a distinction to Michael Madsen as Budd, perhaps the best of the batch. The pinnacle of his acting has to be found in the scene when he's about to bury alive the Bride, he just has to say simple but formidable words to tame her.I repeat it: I'm not really a Tarantino devotee but I have a warm spot on these two 'Kill Bill' movies and I would trade 'Pulp Fiction' (1994) for this duo of films. Various influences from diverse horizons were melded to give two well-rounded flicks which in spite of their different contents complete themselves. Was it wise from Tarantino to release it on two volumes? I think so because if the two films had been bridged end to end, it would have given a spotty, irregular film. So, it was perhaps necessary to divide two distinct parts.",9,1,4,12 August 2006
Vertigo," Among the very best.
","In Boileau-Narcejac's French novel 'D'Entre les Morts'= from among the Dead'),the revelation only comes in the last pages,but Hitchcock lets the cat out of the bag long before the end. Boileau-Narcejac's novel is a pure detective story,but the Master wanted more:the movie already outdistances the book in a first part visually wonderful,with memorable scenes,wrapped in mystery ,such as the one with the sequoia,symbol of immortality or the one down by the sea,to rival with the best romantic movies of all time.In the second part,Hitchcock explains in the Truffaut's book,we know but Scottie( James Stewart) does not .And he tries to recreate a dead woman,to transform Judy into Madeleine.This folie à deux ends where the first tragedy occurred ,which gives the movie a strength that the book had not.Read it and you'll realize how its end ,speaking in terms of cinema,had to be modified for the screen.That's Hitchcock's genius.When Boileau/Narcejac learned that Hitchcock wanted to transfer 'Celle Qui N'Etait PLus ' (=les Diaboliques' )to the screen,they immediately wrote 'D'Entre les Morts ' on the same pattern for Hitchcock to direct.",10,76,127,12 August 2001
Requiem for a Dream," when dreams and nightmares collide...
","My God! 'Requiem for a Dream' (2000), what a movie! It's always difficult to write reviews about perfect movies but I'm going to try. First, there are three adjectives which come to my mind to describe this movie and they're the ones which everyone thinks of: powerful, harrowing and heart-breaking and certain sequences remain engraved in the memories like for example, Jared Leto's wounded arm caused by drug.To watch 'Requiem for a Dream' is like being punched in the face. It's the kind of movie which can't leave indifferent. It is impossible to come out of this horrifying movie unharmed. It was made by a young director Darren Aronofsky whose previous movie 'Pi' (1998) was very hailed. I must admit that I wasn't fully convinced by this indie movie but here, without a doubt, the director entirely hypnotized me and I thank him for that.The movie was made from a novel written by Hubert Selby Jr. It isn't the first time that a work from this novelist is adapted for the screen. Indeed, in 1989, Uli Edel had shot 'Last Exit to Brooklyn' which developed a nightmarish and apocalyptic vision of a mankind who lived in hell. Here, the movie focuses on 4 main characters. There's Harry Goldfarb. He, his girlfriend Marion Silver and his best mate Tyrone C Love plan to become high-rolling smack dealers. In the meantime, his mother Sarah Goldfarb has got her head in the clouds. She received a call and she learned that she's going to appear on television. At the beginning of the film, the 4 characters' hopes amazingly answers the shiny weather of the summer. But as we usually say: best things have an end. Summer will go away to leave place to fall and winter. Just like the dreams will slowly but surely shatter and the 4 main protagonists will embark on an endless suffering. A vertiginous descent into hell like we have never seen one and which will reach its climax in winter in the last half-hour of the movie. From this moment, the film presents a flood of incredible pictures; they are so painful so much that they make the view unbearable. However, you watch it flabbergasted with both repulsion and fascination.Darren Aronofsky invites us to a climbing in the morbid. 'Requiem for a Dream' strikes by its visual and sonorous frenzy. Through, accelerated frenetic sequences, hysterical split-screens, parallel images, the director doesn't pull his punches to describe this diving in absolute horror for the 4 characters. However, in his crazy making, there's none form of unwarranted nature. The features previously quoted may be disturbing but necessary to answer several things which aren't pleasant to hear like for example, to denounce the omnipresence of the consumer society. These abuses express themselves, here, by the crushing presence of objects, perfectly representative of this society like the television or the refrigerator. The another goals of the film: to make us share the physical and moral sufferings of a drug addict, notably through the deterioration of their visual and sonorous perceptions. But also to show us in a straight-forward and rough way, the dependence of a drug addict on his drug. Aronofsky's message is simple to understand. There's not only the drug like cocaine or amphetamines that make dependent but also simple objects apparently harmless which can become dangerous like the television or the refrigerator. They can destroy our faculties of reasoning and judgment. In a way 'Requiem for a Dream' illustrates very well Brad Pitt's key cue in 'Fight Club' (1999): 'things you own end up owning you...'. On the other hand, if we put the stress on drug, the least we can say is that the moments of shooting, the withdrawal times are showed with a realism and bluntness rarely reached. True, 'Trainspotting' (1996) had already presented similar scenes but Darren Aronofsky isn't afraid to go further in daring.It would be unfair to neglect the terrific cast. Beginning with Ellen Burstyn who in all respects gives a dazzling performance. She renders very well the degeneration of her character. In the beginning, she is a normal old lady but in the end, she looks like a senseless living dead. Why didn't she get her Oscar in 2001 instead of Julia Roberts in 'Erin Brockovich' (2000)? Then, concerning Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly well their sensitiveness and fragility are impressive. But the biggest surprise is Marlon Wayans. Who could have thought that he could be at ease in a comic role (Scary Movie) as well as in a dramatic role? These 4 actors make particularly harrowing the very last sequences of the film which show them forever in the depths of despair or madness where pain, humiliation and misery suffer into them. And then, during the final credits, we can hear the sea with a little of relief as if we had just made a nightmare.But what is extraordinary in Aronofsky's work is that he manages to find a little place for humor which acts in an efficient way. In conclusion, this young film-maker has shot a film with a real emotional power. I must confess that I almost shed a tear several times. 'Requiem for a Dream' is a movie I highly recommend but beware! It's not a movie for everyone and for the spectators who didn't watch it, I advise you not to see it if you are in a sad mood. It demands a strong stomach and I think the people who say they weren't afraid during the projection are liars. Don't forget your handkerchief.",10,20,33,20 February 2005
Marie Antoinette," Those were the days in Versailles
","The kings have all departed Their servants are nowhere We burned out all their mansions In the name of Robespierre.(Al Stewart,'the palace of Versailles') But Versailles is intact today.The title is a misnomer.A right one would be 'Marie-Antoinette: the Versailles years' since the screenplay stops in 1789,with 'Le Retour du Boulanger,De la Boulangère Et du Petit Mitron' .Sofia Coppola's umpteenth film about the unfortunate last real queen of France is a visual splendor.Filmed on location in the place where the events took place -anyway,it's not an innovation:Sacha Guitry had already done that fifty years ago in 'Si Versailles M'Etait Conté' -,it's a dazzling work.But it's also a superficial one.Marie-Antoinette is not only that greedy woman ,stuffing herself with pastries.Oh and she almost never drank wine.Historically ,there are good things:the script writers insist it's the war in America which was the main cause for the government's bankruptcy,not the queen's expenses;The Austrian Empress's (an unrecognizable Marianne Faithful)stranglehold on her daughter is not passed over in silence.But,because this is a la mode,much time is given over to the sexual problems.And of course Fersen sleeps with the queen (many historians wrote that their affair remained platonic).Oddly,the affair of the necklace is not even mentioned ,perhaps because of the film starring Hilary Swank that came before.The film about Marie-Antoinette is yet to be done.Like this?Try these 'L'Autrichienne' Pierre Granier-Deferre ,1990: the trial 'Marie-Antoinette' Jean Delannoy 1955 'Marie-Antoinette ' W.S.

The Ring," scary, thoughtful and satisfying which is fine with me
","These last years, apart from the rendering of popular comic strips and the adaptation of TV series for the big screen, American cinema feels a vivacious interest for Oriental culture, especially the Japanese one. Quentin Tarantino's violent and hollow 'Kill Bill' (2003/2004) was supposed to be an homage to the samurai movie (but I'm not a Tarantino buff by a long shot). In the derivative 'the Last Samurai' (2003), Tom Cruise discovered the secrets and treasures of Japanese civilization while Sofia Coppola used the city of Tokyo as the backdrop for her triumphant 'Lost in Translation' (2003). Gore Verbinski chose a more direct and easy way to get interested in Japanese culture: to make a remake of a Japanese movie which became a sleeper: 'Ringu' (1998). Against all odds, he made a killing with it although he's an uneven director. 'Mousehunt' (1997) was a formulaic but enjoyable comedy but 'the Mexican' (2001) was a lame movie. Some friends had told me: 'don't watch 'the Ring', it's a hokey movie'. I think they misjudged it and I found this supernatural thriller quite intriguing and gripping. It has enough commendable stuff in store to grab the audience. I haven't seen the original movie and so I will avoid any comparison.The starting point promises great things and Verbinski will deliver them throughout his flick. The main character, Rachel wants to investigate about a mysterious and cursed videotape which causes the death of the viewer seven days after the latter watched it. What do these outlandish and eerie images mean? What lies beneath them? At her own risk, she and her son watch the video. She has one week to find out the meaning and the omen of the video. 'The Ring' could well illustrate this famous premise: 'to understand evil, we've got to go back to the sources...'.What distinguishes 'the Ring' from other horror stuff of these last years is that there's a solid scenario which holds water until the very last minutes of Rachel's adventure and shelves quite an important number of formulaic ingredients. Special effects which have seemed to become the backbone for many horror flicks are used only when necessary and without flashy effects. Still better, Verbinski shows respect for the audience by clarifying as much as possible obscure points of the story. On an unhurried pace, Verbinski takes all his time to film Rachel's investigation. His directing is also worth the price of admission. It is well-crafted and set with clockwork precision for the schedule of spooky moments. Besides, what is notable in 'the Ring' is that Verbinski delays as much as possible chilling sequences to better play with the viewer's nerves. This entails an unsettling aura which helps to convey a latent tension. Lighting and makeup shouldn't also be forgotten.The thrust of 'the Ring' isn't only to entertain and to make shiver. It is also doubled by a reflexion on the power of the image. One of the images of the film depicts a woman in front of a mirror looking at the camera. So, she's also looking at the viewer. This is unhealthy voyeurism that the movie denounces like the insensible media which expose to the mainstream, woes and sorrows of the victims and so manipulate the viewers' fears. The sequence during which Ann Morgan's husband is incensed by Rachel's will to learn more about Samara rings thoroughly true. Moreover, these seemingly maladjusted images embody symbols: the chair and the lighthouse illustrate loneliness, the figure at the window (a hint at 'Psycho'?, 1960) might symbolize parental severity.That said, Verbinski's genteel piece of work isn't exempted of drawbacks. Rachel's little boy is a cardboard character, a vague cousin of Haley Joel Osment in 'the Sixth Sense' (1999). When Samara gets out of the well and the screen to kill Rachel's companion, it's nearly Punch and Judy and the first sequence with the two female students in their twenties something, all alone in a house in which strange phenomena and false alarms occur... well, you get the picture. But they're minor quibble and don't overflow too much on the thrill of the vision.I repeat it: I haven't seen the Japanese ambassador but when a remake is able both to scare with reserve, without flashy special effects and to make the viewer think about what he watches, it can be gratifying. And in the case of 'the Ring', rightly so...A sequel 'the Ring 2' opened last year. Is it worthwhile?",7,58,93,2 January 2006
Raiders of the Lost Ark," not the worst of the trilogy and not the best
","'Raiders of the lost ark' is arguably the movie that in 1981 gave back to the adventure movie its credibility around three points: exoticism, action and effectiveness.

Training Day," Death is certain ,life is not.
","Pervasive language indeed!One of the only sentences which does not include a swearword is the one tattooed on Washington's arm which I use for my title .A motto which sums up a movie which somewhat renews the 'two-cop team' routine.When the movie begins,I was thinking 'another film where two very different cops -the veteran and the rookie- team up for the best and the worst'.I was wrong.It's not '48 hours' all over again either.Actually everything happens in the short space of one day ,it actually ends in the middle of the night,so the title is thoroughly appropriate .Hawkes portrays an idealist whose ideas will be put to the test in a very violent way.'I was like you are now' says Washington.You can forgive some implausibilities (the cousinand the wallet is the biggest) and enjoy the excellent haunting soundtrack (the final cast and credits avoid the obligatory 'rock' or 'rap ' track and opts for an ominous (almost dirge -like ) music.Tom Berenger is the third name in the final credits,but ,oddly his part does not exceed three minutes and he's got only one or two lines.",7,1,17,14 July 2004
Erin Brockovich," Success story.
","In real life ,the main character was arguably an admirable woman;in the movie,the character is given a treatment which is by no means convincing.First of all,Julia Roberts overplays :the rest of the cast is completely wasted,and serves as a foil to her;look at paunchy aging Finney:he has become his own caricature;Peter Coyote's part is scarcely more than a walk-on and what can we say about his female counterpart,a sexually repressed(?) earnest educated woman?Roberts' long-haired partner barely dares to say a word as well.The intentions are very dubious ;sometimes,it seems that Roberts is not at all some Florence Nightingale,but rather a go-getter who wants to do her walk of life:the last scene ,focussing on money ,is sheer bad taste .We're supposed to find her likable because she's always swearing like a trouper.But her swagger is in direct contrast to that:wherever and whenever she moves, pursuing cockroaches or meeting chic people,she seems to go out of a beauty parlor.Directing is undistinguished,recalling made-for-TV quality.Word to the wise:(if there's any of us left)try 'Silkwood ' instead:Meryl Streep is a much better thespian than Roberts,and the woman she plays did not fight for money but for dear life,because,unlike Erin,she was a victim from the start.",Null,6,11,9 March 2003
Meet the Parents," parental advisory
","This is another topic which has been extremely used in cinema: a young man who wishes to marry his girlfriend but first he's got to ask her parents the permission. And sometimes things don't go as they are expected...By making this movie, it's clear that the director Jay Roach gave the actors a free hand perhaps so as to try to compensate an unremarkable plot. The success of the movie rests on their shoulders. I would grant a special award to Ben Stiller and of course to Robert De Niro who shows that as an actor he's always at ease and excellent after all these years spent in the cinema. Of course, we're obliged to recognize that the humor isn't always subtle, certain characters are nearly stereotyped (Owen Wilson) and the sequence where De Niro blames Stiller for not being honest whereas honesty isn't his strong point appears quite conventional. As Jack Lemmon said in 'Some like it hot' (1959): 'Nobody's perfect'. But there are quite a lot of funny situations and hilarious gags.So, a mastered topic that gives a spirited comedy.",7,0,2,17 January 2004
Se7en," Devil (Kevin Spacey) is seven!
","'Seven' by David Fincher: a movie that attracted a lot of attention and made Fincher go down in history. His efforts devoted to this very original thriller were rewarded since it was one of the most successful movies made in 1995. 'Seven' is probably one of the peaks of the film noir. It's based on a clever and especially devilish screenplay. This devilish side is particularly obvious by certain moments during the movie (notably the end): when Kevin Spacey (the killer) is leaving some clues at places where he committed his murders. He's leaving clues so that Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt can pick up his trail but he's also mocking at police.
Moreover, can we really consider the end as a happy-end. Freeman, once says: 'this isn't going to have a happy-end'. He's partly true. Spacey died but he managed to achieve his grim intention and he broke Pitt's life. When you look at his face in the last pictures, you might think he went mad...The movie is also wrapped in a sordid, dreary even stifling atmosphere. The kinds of feelings you must feel by living such a story. Like 'Psycho' by Alfred Hitchcock, by moments, the movie is plunged into horror (the discovery of the murders).At last, a dazzling performance comes to crown it all: a confident and a tiny bit conceited Brad Pitt teams up with a wistful and disillusioned Morgan Freeman. Both makes a perfect duet. And I think Kevin Spacey's performance is definitely his best one to date.A thriller sometimes violent but always entrancing.",8,2,6,4 June 2003
Unbreakable," Is this Bruce Willis or the movie that is unbreakable?
","By making this movie, M Night Shyamalan certainly felt like renewing with the artistic and commercial success of 'the sixth sense'. At the beginning, 'unbreakable''s got all the elements to become a great fantastic movie in the tradition of 'the sixth sense'. This time it's not the little Halet Joel Osment who's suffering but Bruce Willis himself! He's the only one having survived to a train crash and he hasn't got any broken bone. You can guess it: this situation makes him worried, his family becomes mistrustful, especially his son but more important, a museum director (Samuel L. Jackson) takes an interest in him. Maybe, will he reveal him the truth about the train crash... During a long part, the movie is fascinating. Night Shyamalan makes several odd sequences succeed (the oddest one is probably the first one which is Jackson's birth). These scenes abound in little unseemly details that make the plot progress. Moreover, the director succeeds in giving birth to an anguished climate. We don't see the train crash but everything contributes to distil anxiety. We arrive at the end and this is where the movie lacks of its attraction. Very simply, the conclusion fits badly with the plot and seems simplistic, puerile. Of course, 'unbreakable' is not so far from 'the sixth sense', Bruce Willis is always excellent as he was in his previous movie and Samuel L. Jackson is scheming because he hides a mysterious secret too. But however, you can't help feeling a certain disappointment after having seen 'unbreakable'. For lack of being extraordinary, it's an honourable success but that's all.",Null,1,3,17 January 2003
Fight Club," The things you own ends up owning you.
","What's fascinating in David Fincher's work,is that it seems we deal with an auteur.He created his own universe,a nocturnal and filthy one,and a bit misogynous too:it's glaring in this movie;outside Bonham-Carter-made look ugly and dressed as a 1977 punk-,only a black woman has a line to say.Almost everywhere,it is a man's man's world where no women appear even in the settings.This movie was influenced by famous and not-so-famous predecessors:of course 'Dr Jekill and Mister Hide' to which Bonham Carter hints at in the restaurant,'a clockwork orange' ,'rebel without a cause' 'bad influence' and Joel Schumacher's 'falling down',the latter seems with hindsight to have been overlooked and underrated.So why does this movie seem so original?it owes a lot to E.Norton (more than Pitt)who had already overshadowed R.Gere in 'primal fear'.Here he plays a very strange kind of peeping tom:watching mental suffering (therapy groups ,dealing almost essentially with male problems),then physical sufferings,eventually enduring them.Does he do that as he would opt for yoga,Buddhism or psychotherapy,to escape from a routine work?To get free from the material world?As Pitt says 'the things you...'The problem is that Norton does not seem to be so free.At first,he may be, when he's only a simple spectator-and the scenes in the restaurant and in the projection room are peaks of black humor-,but,he's potentially a Stevensonian hero.There's a big coup de theatre in this movie, a breathtaking and unexpected twist ,à la 'sixth sense' ,'Jacob's ladder' or' Usual suspects' ,and it's difficult to comment this movie :all you say is questioned when you KNOW.Of course I won't reveal it,but I think it's the biggest flaw of the movie.Unlike the three mentioned works,this does not seem logical,because of the lack of 'clues':the only one ,regarding Bonham-Carter, is not really convincing.The last picture seems now terrifying.",10,6,17,27 September 2001
Memento," A movie easy to admire but difficult to like!
","Anyone who is fond of detective films will eager to watch 'Memento'. Besides, at first sight, Christopher Nolan's movie is alluring thanks to the story. Indeed, the story of the movie is worthy of any detective film and this is the kind of story that several directors who are past masters in suspense (Hitchcock of course) wouldn't repudiate at all.This is the story of a man Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) which the woman has been killed. You can guess it easily: his first intention is to track down the killer back and it's not an easy job. It's all the more difficult as he's got a big problem: he suffers from amnesia. Will he succeed in tracking down the murderer?But this is where things are getting difficult: the story is told upside down! At the beginning of the movie we know the murderer and during the movie we must discover his motive. But with such a device, it's very difficult to follow the story because it obeys a logic that is completely unusual in a movie. And this logic is likely to slip the spectator's attention. It happened with me.In 1997, when U2 launched their album 'Pop', 'Rolling Stone' said that it was an album easy to admire but difficult to appreciate. The same critic could be said for 'Memento'. It remains an original movie but it also demands a big intellectual effort and it's perhaps due to this that the movie was a relative commercial failure. Nonetheless, congratulations to Christopher Nolan who managed to make such a movie that exploits very well recurring themas in detective films. For example, amnesia.",Null,3,10,17 October 2003
12 Monkeys," these monkeys will go to heaven...
","'Twelve monkeys''s got all the elements to become Terry Gilliam's masterpiece. An outstanding screenplay, a sustained rhythm, clever sometimes ironic dialogs. Moreover, he had a good nose about the cast. 'Twelve monkeys' is also the first movie where Bruce Willis stands back from the kind of character he used to play in his previous movies. Here, a jaded and hopeless character which you could nickname a prisoner took over from a fearless and invincible hero (as it was the case in 'Die hard'). No matter how he tries, he's a prisoner of the time. The movie contains a very thrilling end too. It's got a real dramatic power. But this terrific movie is also a reflection about man, the dangers he dreads (notably, the ones that could cause the end of the world and here, these are virus that can create illnesses). No matter how long it will take, 'twelve monkeys' will be estimated at its true value: one of the masterpieces made in the nineties.",9,235,294,13 June 2003
Au Revoir les Enfants," and hello again Louis Malle!
","Possible SPOILERS. After having led a roaming and chaotic life during more than ten years abroad, Louis Malle came back in France and made the movie he was always to make. This one was rewarded in Venise where it won the golden Lion in 1987. 'au revoir les enfants' tells the story of a friendship between the son of a wealthy family, Julien and a Jew boy, Jean Bonnet hidden under a false identity. However, at first sight, nothing lets see the start of a friendship between Julien and Jean. Julien feels admiration and curiosity towards this new student but we don't really know why and Jean pretends not to see him. A few events will bring them closer, especially a treasure hunt in the woods... It's a touching, moving and finally tragic story because the intervention of the Gestapo will lead this friendship to an end between the two boys. It's not the first time that a Louis Malle's movie takes place during the second world war. In 1974, 'Lacombe Lucien' told the story of a young peasant who found his place in the Gestapo. If this movie had divided the French public, 'au revoir les enfants' will provoke the unanimity. Both movies are successful and strong but 'Lacombe Lucien' is a rough fiction whereas the other one is partly autobiographical. With this movie, Malle eagered to recall a memory that upset him when he was at school: the arrest of a few Jew children who were hidden under a false identity. This is this memory that he filmed in the last sequence. This last one is carefully prepared and filmed in the minute details as if Malle wanted to recall exactly what he saw it and then don't think about it definitely. This is one of Malle's most beautiful movies and his last great one.",Null,31,38,23 February 2003
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," didn't deserve so much hype in the Summer 2003
","Like musicals, the pirate movie fell a little into oblivion these last years. There were endeavors to revive it but ended either in artistic failure. 'Pirates' (1986) by Roman Polanski enters this category, a project whose preparation was long and arduous and in the end, it was a very impersonal amount and Polanski's absolute nadir of his career with the desultory 'What?' (1972). Then, 'Cutthroat Island' (1995) was a contender for the genre but ended in a financial fiasco. Nearly a decade later, Gore Verbinski with whom, a good majority of cine buffs had unearthed in him palpable skills in directing with the chilling 'the Ring' (2002) and under the command of the Disney firm embarked on a new ship. Direction: the pirate island with the well-intentioned will to restore once for all the reputation of the pirate movie. Unfortunately, he didn't arrive at the end of his trip. His ship fell through. It was a profitable blockbuster for the mighty producer Jerry Bruckheimer who once again lined his pockets. Artistically, well let's be as nice as possible and it will be hard because I had relied on the director of 'the Ring' to rejuvenate the pirate movie and to deliver a solid entertaining film. My hopes were blighted.It was maybe a mistake to have entrusted him a big-budget film. He seems to have been dwarfed by Bruckheimer's omnipotence. However the latter's trademark is present in virtually each shot, each image of the venture and there's nothing wrong about it: exotic landscapes, lush scenery, lavish costumes, grand score, a whiff of epic movie, pursuits galore, naval engagements, a dash of fight and fusillades sequences and of course, perhaps the indispensable element: swashbuckler which was a specialty of French cinema in the sixties, helped by the unparalleled Jean Marais. There was everything in the same package which brought out a conducive odor to entice and charm the greatest number of viewers.Alas! 'Pirates of the Caribbean: the Curse of the Black Pearl' is partly plagued by a derivative directing which can't live up to the enormous means and budget the film had at its disposal. Verbinski had been more inspired with 'the Ring'. However, one can feel a buoyant will from Verbinski to film his story. It's true, there's a perennial humor difficult to resist, fast-paced action. There were also visible efforts on the costumes and scenery. Everything to inspire a good amount to dream, liberty to the audience. But Verbinski sedately shoots Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and Will Turner (Orlando Bloom)'s adventure to find again Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) and in the end, the whole smells the reheated. The movie also could have gained by being curtailed of about half an hour.Verbinski's vehicle is also handicapped by its scenario and it's perhaps what hampers most the success of the film. 'The Ring' had a quite strong screenplay in store but here, it's a snap, slick one. Yes, there are some neat twists to keep the audience interested until the tail end but it also encapsulates major, unacceptable drawbacks which are nonsensical in the story as a whole. So, the malicious pirates took Elizabeth hostage to help them to find a treasure which would make them human beings again (at night, they turn into living dead) but isn't it an excellent opportunity for them to reinforce and establish their power? No, instead they want to become mortal, flesh and blood men again. Then, in the first minutes of the film, after Elizabeth took Will in, she's looking at the sea and as the mist clears away, she can see a pirate ship because of the black flag. The pirate ship is close enough to enable the crew on board to see Elizabeth's ship, so why isn't there a naval engagement? It's also hard to swallow the story of Will's father and the scenarists could have found a better and less far-fetched way to make Depp and Knightley meet. The latter wears a dress with a more than fitted waist and because of this, she falls (from a high height) into the sea (you have to see the sequence to understand it and to realize how ludicrous it is). But fortunately, Depp was in the surroundings... you can guess the rest. There's also some filler in the scenario (when Depp and Knightley are on the desert island).The actors partially redeem the whole. Johnny Depp plays his game well. His mix of gravity and mockery spices up the story. Geoffrey Rush also takes the lion's share about the quality of the acting. But Orlando Bloom delivers a rather wooden acting and Keira Knightley doesn't really display skills of thespian.'Pirates of the Carabbean: the Curse of the Black Pearl' is plagued by a shoddy story which should have been more stringent. There are also flashy special effects and a mundane directing. To some extent, some qualities of 'the Ring' which had contributed in cementing its stance of winner have turned into drawbacks here. Once again, there's no accounting for taste but this blockbuster isn't the guarantee of a quality entertaining movie. But the majority of the audience doesn't seem to have this problem. A sequel will reach the streets this summer. Will it be worthwhile?",5,3,11,29 March 2006
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," so gross, so extravagant, so enjoyable
","For the ones who have never heard about the cult series 'South Park' and if you don't know what you're going to watch, don't expect a product from the Disney firm! On the other hand, if you're familiar with this series which was extremely popular at the dusk of the nineties in the USA but also in France, then you're going to be rejoiced by its contents. I must admit that before watching this black diamond, I had watched some installments of 'South Park' and was both deeply amused and shocked.So, in the wake of the triumph of the series, its creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone could only produce its movie and one thing is sure: they must have had a tremendous time penning it and the amount is highly exhilarating. Just have a look at the wacky and a little join-the-dots story (the second epithet is not meant pejoratively). Cartman, Stan, Kyle and the ill-fated Kenny managed to go to the movies to watch a film rated 'R' because it's filled with filthy language and coarse actions. This screening had a big influence on them and reproduce this language to their pals. As it was expected, their parents and especially their mothers are scandalized. An organization of meetings, discussions could lead to the death sentence of Terrence and Philip but also to a world war. It's all the more serious as the devil flanked by his egoistic lover Saddam Hussein contemplates to conquer and dominate the whole world.This summary of the story is incomplete. It would take a few more paragraphs to assess its contents. But it's nearly a mainspring for the authors of the series to deliver a scathing critic of the puritan, right-thinking America ready to behave in a reactionary way when their values, customs are challenged. But Trey Parker and Matt Stone have more than one string to their bows. Why not letting the faults, sickening aspects of America show through? And the targets are numerous, either it is for instance the army or the American families, institutions. It's partly on these points that 'South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut' draws a devastating strength. But it would be nearly a crime to pass over in silence what makes this animation film both so gross and so enjoyable: filthy language galore, black humor as one could wish ('Kenny we have replaced your heart with a potato!'), a story which becomes more and more extravagant and I wonder whether the sequence when a doctor announces he has found a treatment to stop children to tell swearwords and experiences it on poor Cartman isn't a spoof of 'a Clockwork Orange' (1971)...The authors' intentions were perfectly fulfilled with this film. Here willing intentions gave a highly rumbustious, exquisitely offending gem which won't cater for all tastes. The viewers who hate being shocked, you'd better turn away from it and I wouldn't recommend the film to children at all or otherwise as Parker and Stone said: 'parents have to decide themselves whether their children are mature enough to watch the film'.",8,3,3,7 July 2006
Spider-Man 2," I didn't see the first Spider-Man but I really enjoyed the second!
","Possible spoilers...As I wrote in the title, I didn't watch the first Spider-Man when it was released in 2002. But a friend invited me to go and see 'Spider-Man 2' at the movies and I honestly don't regret it at all. I was surprised to discover that Sam Raimi made this sequel (as well as the first Spider-Man movie). I found out later that he is a big fan of the comic strip; so he seemed to be cut out to shot the adventures of Peter Parker alias Spider-Man. It's better this way because this blockbuster has got plenty of qualities that worth the detour.The movie owes its success partly thanks to the nearly constant humor that are in the dialogs and also in the character acted by JK Simmons. For him, it is the opportunity to offer a delightful performance.Spider-Man 2 also enjoys quite stunning special effects which are never intrusive and used only when necessary, mainly in action or bravery sequences. But these sequences don't seem to be the most important ones in Raimi's eyes. We can't say that 'Spider-Man 2' is a pure action movie from the beginning to the end. Indeed, the director rather put the accent on the psychology of his main character, Peter Parker. He doesn't introduce him as a perfect super hero but as a clumsy young man torn between his private life that he can't manage to assume and his doubts about being Spider-Man. In short, Raimi goes against the clichés generally attributed to super heroes and offers a more complex and ambiguous view of a super hero. He also had intuition by choosing Tobey Maguire for the first role because he's truly talented and perfect. Moreover, he's got a nice personality which makes him likable straightaway. There's also an excellent choice for Kirsten Dunst whose beauty and face light the film up.With 'A simple plan' (1998), Sam Raimi had achieved a tour de force in the thriller. Here, in another extent, 'Spider-Man 2' can be taken for a new success in Raimi's work and his efforts are widely rewarded because the movie is already a huge commercial success in France. Even, if you can find faults in the film (when Spider-Man flies in the air, the movie resembles pictures taken from a video game. The film also follows a classical outline typical from Hollywood scripts with a scientist acted by Alfred Molina who wants to use his power through his latest discovery to control New York. So, it seems that Spider-Man can be the only one to save the city. Then, the end of the movie which sees Maguire and Dunst united together lets suggest that Hollywood has been through that), you can only find pleasure in watching Raimi's film which should logically lean on to a third opus in the Spider-Man series. If it's the case, let's hope that Raimi will shot it and as far as I'm concerned, the success of 'Spider-Man 2' made me want to watch the first movie.  But at the moment, for once that a follow-up is really successful, let's take advantage of it!",8,2,7,9 August 2004
The Fifth Element," the perfect element for a perfect movie
","It's probably Luc Besson's best movie (with 'le grand bleu'). In his movie, he takes back a trendy subject which is to save the world. On this subject that many directors would have surely taken seriously as it was the case with 'Independance day', Besson introduces a lot of humor into his film. This humor is unexpected, involuntary and  the movie's got funny scenes that are most of the time based on the stroke (like the moment when Bruce Willis is taking Milla Jovovich (the fifth and perfect element) to the priest( Ian Holm) and the last one  thought that the fifth element had vanished forever. So you can imagine his reaction. Not only are some scenes funny but the dialogs are often zany. These comical elements enable to overlook the dramatic side of the situation. On another hand, Besson controls perfectly his movie: almost all the scenes (especially the action scenes) are meticulously well-ordered at the level of the making, the light, the costumes etc... So the movie doesn't neglect any point. Moreover,  Besson's making is inventive, clever ( besides the movie won an Oscar in France in 1998 for the best director). The screenplay is remarkably well put together and is boosting the spectator's attention by the apparition of new facts in common with the plot, even if it's a little manichean. The film is a pleasant surprise thanks to its actors too. Bruce Willis is simple, just, he doesn't ham it up and doesn't play the he-man. Gary Oldman is a wicked who never falls into the caricature; he's even fanciful and ridiculous. Let's add that the other actors are all excellent. At last , a sustained rythm not spoiled by the special effects, some extraordinaries sceneries; it seems that everything in this movie (which looks like a comic strip), was designed to charm the spectator. So it's not surprising that it was enormously successful in France.A remark: here, the president's got a neutral role unlike 'Independance day' in which the president pilots a fighter plane.",8,4,11,15 December 2002
Batman Returns," the hero's return
","With 'Batman Returns', Tim Burton succumbed to an important priority in American cinema: giving a sequel to a blockbuster. Three years after the most successful movie of the year, 'Batman' (1989), here comes the hero of Gotham City again for the pleasure of many spectators. Like its predecessor, 'Batman Returns' enjoyed an enormous commercial success. Tim Burton made Batman come back once again because it is to believe that the victory of the latter on his enemy the Joker did little to improve the image of Gotham City. Indeed, violence and corruption still exist and here, the second word is epitomized by Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) and the penguin (Danny De Vito). These two crooks who are eager to take control of Gotham City are going to make life difficult for Batman. His task will be more difficult with the apparition of Catwoman... Tim Burton still delivered much work on the scenery and it seems that he tried to correct the faults of the first movie. It means that the director gave way to fight sequences which are better mastered than in the first Batman. But he didn't neglect the psychology of his main characters for all that. If in the movie of 1989, Burton had focused on Bruce Wayne/Batman's psychology, here, it's the penguin that obviously interested him. The director attempted to make of him, very well acted by De Vito an ambiguous character. On one hand, he's full of bad intentions (previously quoted) but on the other hand, he's searching for his past and would like to be considered as a real man.'Batman Returns' also appears as crazier than its predecessor, especially with the cast. I think of Michèle Pfeiffer who offers a daring and powerful performance as Catwoman. Besides, at the time when I'm writing this review, it makes me remember that a new version of Catwoman is currently at the cinema. But given the bad reviews (3 out of 10 on IMDb!), it is sure that her performer Halle Berry must pale into insignificance beside Pfeiffer.Ultimately, this film is one of the best sequels of 1992 and it enables to develop Tim Burton's peculiar style. We also still find his taste for the strange and the Gothic. Concerning Batman's other adaptations for the screen, you can skip them. 'Batman Forever' (1995) and 'Batman and Robin' (1997) are no good. I heard that Christopher Nolan was shooting the beginning of the Batman story and it was to be released next year. Will it match Tim Burton's works?",7,3,9,9 September 2004
The Others," to rank among the 5 best movies made in 2001
","'And all the other voices said: change your mind, you're always wrong' (the Cure, Other Voices, Faith, 1981).A few years ago, Alejandro Amenabar's third movie was prominent in the top 250 of IMDb. But today, it isn't there any more. That's really unfair. It largely deserved its place and to occupy it as long as possible.After, 'Tesis' (1996) and 'Abre Los Ojos' (1997), Amenabar goes up a notch and signs with 'the Others' (2001) a masterful masterpiece which refreshes fantastic cinema and breathes new life into the theme of the haunted house. He largely deserves his nickname of 'new young prodigy of Spanish cinema'. With Tom Cruise, partly responsible for the production, one could fear a strong Hollywood influence in Amenabar's opus. But fortunately, it's nothing of the sort. As a matter of fact, just like the great M Night Shyamalan, Alejandro Amenabar appears as a real author, on the fringe of the Hollywood industry and he's got enough character to let his style nurture. Let's hope he won't be crushed by the Hollywood machine. The movie was shot in Spain, with eventually a modest budget (17 millions of dollars) and it was a surprise to see it doing brilliantly a little everywhere in the world.Amenabar had already ventured in the dreadful world of the snuff-movies with his debut movie 'Tesis' and had succeeded in mixing several films genres in one cohesive narrative line with 'Abre Los Ojos'. But with 'the Others', one didn't suspect a real ease in the 'In Camera'. It's a quite dramatic change of style and in the end a successful translation in the fantastic.Amenabar's references are easy to guess. They're three cornerstones in fantastic cinema: 'the Innocents' (1961), 'the Haunting' (1963) and 'the Sixth Sense' (1999). 'The Others' can be considered as the meeting of these three opus. All the elements of the fantastic movie with Gothic nature are gathered and perfectly used. There's no shortage of examples: an austere mansion with a sinister architecture which hides a dark secret, big rooms half obscured, a mist which tends to thicken throughout the days, characters with sinister-looking faces. All these features blend themselves to create a nearly stifling universe. Moreover, Amenabar favors a calm and quite slow rhythm to play with the spectator's nerves as much as possible and we are entitled to real moments of fear. It is also interesting to write that a minimum of special effects is just enough for the director to maintain anxiety. He also weaves a more and more threatening atmosphere marked out by the progressive reversal of situation (in the beginning of the film, Nicole Kidman dominated Fionnula Flanagan but in the middle of the film, it's the contrary which happens). And, of course, like in a successful suspense movie, virtually all the obscure or ambiguous points are clarified making the story incredibly coherent and after the final conclusion (which of course, I won't reveal), the very last sequences have a strong emotional power and it would take a heart of stone to resist them. On another extent, let's also take down the omnipresence of religion, supposed to be a sort of protection for Nicole Kidman but which, in the end turns out to be useless. One can put forward that Amenabar had surely a strong catholic education and he must have lost his faith...But the qualities of 'the Others' don't stop here. It is visually and technically an appealing movie with a gorgeous photography (certain images are breathtaking) and there's also a careful work on sound and the original soundtrack. On of the most important characteristics from Alejandro Amenabar is that he composes the music of his own films and her, very simply, he excels himself. The delicate and disturbing sounds we can hear contribute to reinforce the threatening atmosphere of the film and makes us feel a little more ill-at-ease again.'The Others' was released when Nicole Kidman had just divorced Tom Cruise and I had thought that she gave the image of a more mature and ambitious actress. Amenabar's flick confirms it. One is really under the impression that she gives the best that she can. There's nothing to say about her role she takes with consummate skill. Her role of haughty middle-class housewife with a cold and penetrating look is sufficient to make one shudder. What is strange is that her name in the film is Grace and her hairstyle is reminiscent of Grace Kelly's. Is it a nod to the actress? Be that as it may, it would be unfair to forget the rest of the cast, especially Fionnula Flanagan who under a docile and frail appearance can easily become disturbing. At last, Amenabar made quite a creditable job of the directing of children who are, in general difficult actors to direct.A chilling and great movie from start to finish. To fully savor all lights turned off. Highly recommended. Hats off to Mr Amenabar: he is one of the main leaders of Spanish cinema and his career is starting well as the triumph of 'Mar Adentro' (2004) testifies.",10,11,20,25 March 2005
Dead Poets Society," Dead creativity society
","This movie was a blockbuster and it's sure easy to see why.It's got a nice ,vapid ,'moving' screenplay ,with enough demagogy to win over the White House.You cannot be wrong when you show a nice ,modern,likeable,teacher.Is there anybody to tell me why cool teachers are always lit teachers?Look at the maths teacher:he's so grotesque that only naive people will bother.It sure is easier to tear out pages from a literature book:after all,you can study Thomas Hardy before Edgar Allan Poe ,who cares?Or use a 'method' of your own.But try to study,say,the differential equations before the exponential fonction! Actually Robin Williams character is dangerous and should be kicked out .His influence makes one of his students  commit suicide:that does not prevent his mindless idiot mates to give him (the teacher) a loud cheer.Don't tell me their 'carpe diem' mentor teaches them to live!

Ed Wood," Tim Burton's best film ?
","With this film, Tim Burton planned  to tell us the life of the worst director in the world ever. His name was Ed Wood and he lived in the fifties. We learn that Ed Wood loves wearing angora pullovers and women clothes. He also loves being dressed up as a woman and above all he's fond of the actor Bela Lugosi and his horror films. When Wood's meeting him for the first time, he's so elated that he wants him to play on his poor films. On the other hand, Burton show us the way Ed Wood used to make his films and we can say that they were very eccentric: for example a wholesaler in meat accepted to produce one of his films 'Bride of the Monster' and the special effects are ridiculous: in the worst film ever made 'Plan 9 from outer space' (even the title doesn't mean anything), flying saucer are made of cardboard. Then, in the last years of his life, Wood was living in poverty, took a lot of alcohol and finally died in 1978 at the age of 54 years old.This film is very successful because Burton attempts to reconstruct Ed Wood's life as precisely as possible and Johnny Depp is very convincing in the role of this fascinating man so Burton succeeded in his plan. Of course Wood's films are the worst films ever made but he thought that he was making masterpieces just like Orson Welles! I found it both funny and extraordinary. But the film is worth being watched thanks also to Martin Landau who is very good in his Bela Lugosi role; thanks to his performance, he won an oscar for the supporting role. The other actors like Bill Murray or Patricia Arquette are very well used  Moreover, the film alternates comic moments, especially when Wood is making his films, and tragic moments such as Lugosi's funerals. At last not only made Burton a masterpiece but he also paid a tribute to Z films.",9,7,8,17 June 2002
Home Alone," an average conventional comedy
","The first time I saw this film was when I was a child and it pleased me a lot because I only saw its comic side. I saw it recently and it disappointed me although the story is original: during Christmas holidays, the McCallister family decided to celebrate Christmas at Paris, unfortunately they forgot one of their children. First of all, Kevin is elated but he realizes that two thieves want to burgle his house. In order to get rid of them, he puts in several traps; the thieves are under arrested and Kevin finds again his family. If I had to choose one adjective to judge this film, it would be the term: conventional. Several sides of the film are showing it. For example, Kevin's family seem to ignore and despise him and consequently he feels rejected and outraged and ,at the end, his family and especially his mother discovers how much she loves him, moreover, they say that Kevin's neighbour is a killer and he's got a wicked reputation but Kevin finds out that he's not a murderer and he had an unhappy life. Not only is the film conventional but the screenplay is sometimes predictable : when Kevin finds out that is 'home alone' he wants to have fun as much as he can, and finer feelings are often put forward . Nevertheless, Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci, the two thieves are very entertaining and the sequence where they have to endure Kevin's traps is very funny. At last, I think that this film was especially made for children and young teenagers and it was useless to make it follow by two poor sequels.",Null,9,18,10 June 2002
Insomnia," Al Pacino is so tired he can't sleep
","Two policemen, Will Dormer (Al Pacino) and Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan) are sent in Alaska to make an investigation around the murder of a high school girl. Convinced that the murder was committed by a serial killer, Dormer decides to organize a police raid in an isolated house where seems to live the suspected murderer. But he (unintentionally?) kills his team mate. Fortunately, no-one saw him and because he doesn't want to be suspected, he gives a coherent reason about Eckhart's death which enables him to be saved. But the real murderer (Robin Williams) saw him killing Eckhart and starts to blackmail him.It is from this reversal of situation, the cop dominated by the killer, that 'Insomnia' draws its originality. Here, several factors (that play in favor of Williams to the detriment of Pacino) explain this: Al Pacino's sickness: insomnia which prevents him from sleeping and especially the scenery where the action takes place, Alaska. An apparently peaceful land at least for its inhabitants but dreadful for foreigners, especially for Al Pacino. Indeed, the fact that it is always daylight only makes his sickness worse and makes him vulnerable in Williams' eyes. It is useful to add that Al Pacino is dazzling as an insomniac cop and the director Christopher Nolan emphasizes on his progressive weakening throughout the movie. On another hand, it is not a coincidence if his name is Dormer. It means 'sleeper' in French so I think that only French people who watched this movie can appreciate the irony.With all that has been previously said, 'Insomnia', according to me partly renews the detective movie. The result gives a solid and carefully constructed thriller. The sole shortcoming Christopher Nolan and his crew did is having hired Robin Williams to act the role of the killer. Throughout his career, he has been hired so many times in good roles and here, it is difficult to see him in the shoes of a criminal. Moreover, when he appears on the screen, the movie becomes quite talkative. These handicaps stop the movie from ranking among the greatest thrillers ever made but all the same, 'Insomnia' constitutes a very good moment.",7,5,11,17 July 2004
Sleepy Hollow," another Tim Burton winner
","The strange, the bizarre, old legends have always fed Tim Burton's imagination and so, he had to discover and to get enthusiastic about the legend of the Headless Horseman. At the very end of the eighteenth Century, Ichabot Crane (Johnny Depp) is a young inspector who only trusts rationality to clarify the numerous murders in New York and he is indignant at the imprisoning ways for the culprits. To put his convictions to the test, the leaders of the city send him in a small isolated village, Sleepy Hollow to investigate on a series of murders committed by a mysterious headless horseman. As it was expected, his rational thoughts collapse but don't stop him from slowly garnering clues about the horseman. The whole affair involves manipulation, witchcraft and the authorities of the village seem to be the targets of 'the monster'.Every time we're about to discover a Tim Burton piece of work, we can be sure of one thing that can be proof of artistic achievement: the aesthetic beauty that shrouds many of the filmmaker's works. From this perspective, 'Sleepy Hollow' is an aesthetic refinement with its somber cinematography that highlights the disquieting landscapes, especially when the headless horseman appears. But also the shady places of the village. Black and gray are the prevailing colors of this Gothic tale. This visual splendor redeems certain clumsy steps of the plot where the interest somewhat depletes like for instance the moment when Depp is shaken in his bed because he realized the headless horseman existed and also the nearly end of the film when too many explanations about the horrid facts were given in one sequence. But the strong visual appeal of this tale which reminds the ones we used to read as children makes you effortlessly forget these weak points that also include the inhabitants' perception towards Crane. See his arrival in the village when the villagers close their shutters in front of him.Once again, Johnny Depp owes a great deal to Tim Burton to have given him a role worthy of his wide acting skills. With 'Sleepy Hollow', the filmmaker gave us a Gothic tale for adults, teenagers which is bound to remind them of their childhood nightmares as well as a momentous work in a prestigious filmography.",8,2,3,7 June 2007
We Were Soldiers," You're a soldier (Hüsker Dü)
","'We were soldiers' is just another useless war movie about the Vietnam war and undoubtedly one of the worst war movies ever made. It contains an important number of faults. It's hard for me to believe that it's based on a true story because the story of the movie's got a Hollywood character and the vision of the Vietnam war remains very pedantic.Randal Wallace's movie also ranks among the most violent war movies ever made. The battle sequences are very impressive and bloody. Moreover, Wallace obviously wanted to stabilize his movie between the fight sequences at Vietnam and the sequences with soldiers' women who inform themselves of the news involving their husbands. It's a logical but shaky method.At last, an overwhelming music and a conventional end don't help matters. In the long run, 'we were soldiers' is a very superficial war movie and by accumulating hackneyed topics and clichés linked to Vietnam war, it leaves indifferent and even creates boredom.

The Adventures of Tintin," The curse of the crimson pirate.
","Since 1947, they have been making movies starring Tintin; the first one was some kind of puppet show based on the 'Crabe Aux Pinces D'Or', an extract of which was screened some years ago on TV. But the movie itself seemed lost before it reappeared on DVD. Then, in the sixties, there were two movies with actors starring a Tintin lookalike, Jean-Pierre Talbot, but only the first one was entertaining. It was Tintin Et Le Mystère De La Toison D'Or (1961) while Tintin Et Les Oranges Bleues (1964) was a disaster. Then, there were two full feature cartoons: Le Temple Du Soleil (1969) and Tintin Et Le Lac Aux Requins (1972). To be complete, we can mention two series of MTV cartoons, the Belvision ones in the sixties which haven't aged well and the Ellipse ones in the nineties which were faithful to the comic books.Spielberg's work is the movie the 'Tintinophiles' have always been waiting for. A cross between Le Crabe Aux Pinces D'Or and Le Secret De La Licorne with a dash of Le Trésor De Rackham Le Rouge thrown in for good measure, plus hints at On A Marché Sur La Lune (bubbles of whiskey) and L'Affaire Tournesol (the Castafiore breaking glass with her voice). The screenplay was carefully worked but begins to falter when Tintin and Captain Haddock are in Morocco. But it regains its strength in the basements of Moulinsart. The opening sequence is a delight: Hergé drawing a sketch of his hero is pure genius. Having replaced Haddock's visions (the bottle of Champagn) by the epics of his ancestor on the Unicorn in the desert is probably the best idea and shows Spielberg's and Jackson's knowledge of psychoanalysis latent in almost all Hergé's work. Turning Sakharine from a harmless collector into the villain was also an asset because it allowed an unexpected connection with the past.Tintin and Haddock are close to perfect but the Dupondts leave a bit to be desired: their sensational comical power is not fully exploited. And if we appreciate the smart introduction of the 'Milanese Nightingale', we may regret the absence of professor Tournesol. We hope they save him for the second installment.No doubt about it: Spielberg and Jackson pulled it off with gusto. Even Milou isn't insignificant as he was in the sixties works. The scene with the sandwich on the ship belongs to him.'Tintinophile''s honor: this is superb entertainment. To be precise: this is superb entertainment",10,6,12,11 November 2011
Snatch," In 1983, Sonic Youth said: 'confusion is sex'. Well in 2000, 'confusion is snatch'!
","'Snatch' is a movie that I wanted to see for a long time because I heard a lot of good things about Guy Ritchie's movie. So I watched it and I must say that I was absolutely amazed. I mean that I didn't feel happiness but disappointment, a big disappointment...However, at first, 'Snatch' is a promising movie thanks to a catchy story. In short, it deals with a pursuit around a priceless diamond in which (too many) characters and a dog are involved.But the main problem of 'Snatch' resides in its screenplay. The quality of the screenplay is identical as Brad Pitt's way of speaking in this movie (he acts a gipsy who's keen on boxing). It means that the screenplay is so confused that it makes the movie hard to follow. You could even think that the plot is non-existent. Indeed, instead of following the unifying thread of the main plot, you feel that the movie is divided in several individual little plots apparently without any link. The screenplay is also muddled due to an important number of the characters.Moreover, Guy Ritchie obviously wanted to make a black comedy. This is in itself a good idea but here, we deal with a black humor that isn't very well exploited. So as a consequence, you don't laugh a lot.As for Ritchie's directing, well we can say that it's lively, maybe a little too lively to leave the movie an impression of botched up in spite of interesting and clever ideas. Ritchie must have been influenced by 'Fight Club' (1999) by David Fincher because his making contains likenesses with Fincher's making in the quoted film.At the end, 'Snatch' is a disappointment and an unfunny movie. One last thing: be warned! The movies that are included in the top 250 on imdb aren't inevitably the best ones...",Null,1,8,17 October 2003
The Beach," on the beach...
","In the beginning of 2000, everyone waited impatiently, the release of the movie 'the beach', mainly because Leonardo DiCaprio was in the main role. You thought that he was going to carry on with dignity, following the huge commercial and artistic success of 'Titanic'. But sadly, it's not the case. This movie that is a new variation of the lost paradise is a disappointment. As far as I'm concerned, I saw the movie at the cinema when it was launched in February 2000 and I thought that it would focus only on DiCaprio, Ledoyen and Canet's efforts to discover this beach. Actually, my expectation was justified but it only lasts half an hour. When they discover the beach and they adhere to the community, I think the movie could have ended there. The second part (which starts with the three Swedish bitten by a shark) only plays the role of fill-in and spoils all the movie. Moreover, Danny Boyle eyes a bit too much towards the bloody.Otherwise, to put it mildly is that the dialogs of 'the beach' are few inspired sometimes silly and too convenient with the situations. Sometimes, the movie turns out to be too predictable: before the love affair between DiCaprio and Ledoyen, you guess that a love story will start between them. And, inevitably, it will cause Canet's jealousy but this jealousy will spread to Ledoyen she learns that DiCaprio had sex with Sal during their stay in Bangkok. Besides, the performance appears quite mixed: Ledoyen and Canet are paling into insignifiance next to DiCaprio. Another thing I noticed: DiCaprio' voice-off doesn't succeed in making the movie gripping as it was the case with Edward Norton in 'Fight Club'.Then, let's admit it: the end of the movie seems too easy and conventional. You guess before the end that the perfect paradise doesn't exist on earth and certainly not in Thailand: there are sharks, it's not always shiny and Sal, the leader of the community reveals herself to be despotic and finally cruel. Let's add that the 'paradise keepers' will do anything to protect their territory, even to kill...Nevertheless, the movie enjoys a shiny photography that reflects brilliantly the color of the sea and the beach. Landscapes are magnificient and there's a good original soundtrack which includes Moby's porcelain. But these qualities aren't sufficient enough to save the movie. A disappointing and predictable movie and somewhere unfinished. You can blame Boyle for not revealing the reasons of Daffy's suicide.",3,26,50,20 April 2003
Final Destination 2," death like time's got her own plans 2
","Many horror movie fans were pleasantly surprised by the discovery in 2000 of 'Finale Destination'. Its author, James Wong who cut his teeth on the X-Files saga (I'm not a fan at all of this series) had made a killing with this classy B movie which encompassed teenage, slasher, fantastic and horror movie in the same package. The viewer remembered of the invisible but omnipresence of death which was adamant about her plans and desperately tried to kill one after the other, this bunch of students led by Alex who tried to thwart her plans. It paid off well since this mix met the public's approval. So, in the wake of this little triumph, the nearly inevitable follow-up was De Rigueur.At first sight, 'Final Destination 2' seems to have the essential elements to have thumbs up from the audience. First, the multiple crash is impressively filmed. The director David R. Ellis who was a stunt-man and partly responsible for some action sequences in 'the Matrix Reloaded' (2003) could show his expertise to film this vertiginous sequence. But his certain talent for directing can also be felt here and there throughout Kimberly's efforts to subvert death's plans. Then, there's a palpable, taut scenario. Many horror flicks today rely on special effects as the backbone of the film. Okay, there are rather flashy special effects here but used only when necessary. The moments during which death tries to take away the unfortunate victims are set with clockwork precision and announced with foreboding signs. Macabre humor is also more than acceptable but as the film is much more gore than the first chapter, it is not really for the faint-hearted. So, it's an enticing menu and one figures that one wouldn't want to shelve 'Final Destination 2' in the messy department of useless sequels.But if one takes a closer look, one realizes that Ellis' film is merely a photocopy of its first edition. The strengths of the film also constitute its weaknesses. Weaknesses because the qualities which contributed in cementing the first installment in its place of winner are rehashed here without novelties. The starting point and its development are identical as the thrust of the first film: to try at all costs to outsmart death's sinister intentions which isn't prepared to accept this and that's all. The surprise effect is absent and in short, you take the same old people with adequate replacements. So, the pile-up superseded the plane crash. Then, it seems that the authors tried to justify the making of this second chapter by linking the present story to a connection with the story of the first flick (check the sequence in the middle of the film when the ill-fated ones talk about the bunch of students in the first film). But in spite of these attempts and new tricks displayed by the scenarists to try to give the story substance, it's a run-on-the-mill fantastic film.If you really enjoyed the first opus, then this may be your cup of tea. If you liked it without hailing it as a miracle, you can pass by. What's the point of watching the same story again with minor changes? And the end leaves the door open for a third episode which opened early this year. Is it any good?",5,5,10,3 June 2006

Lost in Translation," take the time to relax yourself a little with this little pearl
","In 1999 Sofia Coppola made a breakthrough in the landscape of North-American cinema with 'the Virgin Suicides' in which she walled up 5 lovely female teenagers in silence due to their severe parents and notably their mother. 4 years later, Francis Ford's daughter moves to Tokyo in Japan but keeps the theme of loneliness to give it to her two lost main characters as a means to assess their lives.So, Tokyo constitutes the backdrop for this bitter story. It's a city brimming with lights and people and from a Western standpoint, one often imagines the image of an uptight city. Sofia Coppola rather showcases us a laid-back, carefree vision in which the modernism of the city symbolized by a highly advanced technology and tall buildings is next to a preservation of old traditions and customs. Japan has a strong power of fascination on Western society and I've heard several times some of my peers that they would love to go there. If their dreams come true one day, it is highly likely that they will feel puzzled on the first days of their stay, just like Bob Harris (Bill Murray) and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson). The former is a prestigious, seasoned actor who came to Tokyo to pocket a few millions of dollars for a whiskey brand while the latter is a fresh philosophy graduate from Yale who hurriedly married a young photographer. Both are somewhat jettisoned by their native close relatives. Both wind up in a four-star hotel amid a country with a culture and a language they don't understand and both are sleepless due to jet lag and in prey to a deep inner turmoil. Nothing at first lets suggest the success of this May-to-December relation but each of them found a soul mate to provide them solace and relief. Charlotte doesn't know what to do with her life but perceives Bob as a solid rock while Bob who is at wits' end considers Charlotte as a reminder of his youth.From the arrival of the two heroes in the chic hotel to their first moments together to their exploration of the city through the mob, colorful places and with their mutual support, Sofia Coppola reused a formula which proved its worth in her precedent work and here it shines again to give astounding results. Everything in her directing breathes delicacy, fragility and she favors a low-key cinematographic language. So it entails a sort of complicity with her two leads. A good pack of her sequences rings thoroughly true like for example when Charlotte rings her mother to tell her her first day in Tokyo. Then, the fax and the telephone are the sole means of communication with their native country for her two heroes and lets the audience suggest the state of their own relationships, especially with Bob whose private life and particularly his marriage goes unravel. Looks, gestures have a big intensity while the suggested has a meaty part in the dialogs. To make the dish more appealing, the female filmmaker had also recourse to a discreet humor like when Bob tries to follow the Japanese director's instructions through the interpreter. Sofia Coppola was right not to steer her film towards a well-worn master plan which would have seen the two characters almost at once in each other's arms. Actually, I must admit that I didn't think of this perspective during the major part of the film. It's much more novel to see two human beings finding their bearings in the throes of a whirlpool shrouding a noisy city and a seemingly indecipherable culture that they timidly tame.The evocative original soundtrack is in perfect adequacy with the images and was discerningly chosen. The lyrics of 'More Than This' by Roxy Music could apply to Bob (you have to see his performance on a karaoke) and Charlotte. Specialists of noise such as 'My Bloody Valentine' and 'the Jesus and Mary Chain' are a perfect musical illustration of the urban chaos in which the two characters happily wrestle.This is also Bill Murray's most ground-breaking role since 'Groundhog Day' (1993). Like in this ingenious comedy, he acts a cynical man who eventually transmits joy and happiness to the ones he meets. Here his deadpan humor and his sense of restraint could justify the screening of the film. Beside him, Scarlett Johansson epitomizes grace and fragility. This trip to Tokyo was bracing for them and also for the viewer. This prizewinning indie remains etched on his or her memory and this is one to ponder.",9,2,6,9 December 2006
Full Metal Jacket," A realist but highly overrated war movie
","There's no denying that Stanley Kubrick's films have become landmarks in the history of cinema. '2001: A Space Odyssey' (1968) helped to make science-fiction a major cinematographic genre and 'The Shining' (1980) is a spooky fantastic film. Needless to add that his visual virtuosity plunges the audience in a state close to hypnoses. His films are unique but not necessarily in the good sens of the term. Full Metal Jacket (1987) arrived seven years after The Shining. I read on several covers of the film: the greatest war movie ever made. It's not really appropriate to deem it this way.The work is divided into two parts: the training of the Marines and men at war. Many critics were adamant that the adventures of Joker in Vietnam were the result of the catastrophic brainwashing in Parris Island. It's really hard to adopt this principle for there's virtually nothing in the second part that echoes to the first one; except maybe the compulsive character of Adam Baldwin who is turned into a real killing machine and it's blatant in the last third of the film.Thus Full Metal Jacket looks like a clumsy film made of two halves that have virtually nothing in common. The first part, taking place at Parris Island is, all in all trite in the obnoxious devices commanded by Lee Ermey who nevertheless gives a genuine performance. It's the least he could do since he was a former instructor. Hartmann's humiliating methods aim at imposing discipline and hatred. But there's nothing new under the sun because many films and TV movies already showed it. And the evolution of Pyle is highly debatable. How can a dumb young man can progress in such a fast way? His suicide is at a pinch understandable.As for the second part, i's hardly satisfying even if the scenery if impressive and original for it is made of ruins of a city. The filmmaker also makes us really share the fears of the bunch of soldiers trapped by an invisible snipper. But the end spoils the rest for it is pathetic and cozy. Furthermore, his symbolism remains shallow like for instance Joker who wears a badge to suggest the duality of man The only reason Full Metal Jacket distinguishes itself from other war movies is Kubrick's making that favors traveling and geometrical camera movements and shots. In spite of this, the film can't take its place alongside the greatest war movies ever made unlike '2001: a Space Odyssey' with science-fiction.",5,4,11,10 December 2010
Corpse Bride," an enchantment at all levels
","The year 2005 was excellent for Tim Burton. A few months after he filled us with joy with his stylish rendering of Roald Dahl's novel 'Charlie and the chocolate factory', he extended the pleasure with this stop motion picture whose only fault is to be too much short. However, it's a feast for the eye and the mind.Sourced from an old legend according to which a young man accidentally has to marry a corpse bride (one recognizes Burton's inclination for myths and legends), 'Corpse Bride' bears the trademark of its auteur, beginning with the backdrop and the scenery. A dreary, gray depiction of London tangled in Victorian values and bribery at the end of the nineteenth Century sharply contrasts with a bright, brisk representation of the great beyond animated with colorful, eccentric skeletons, living dead. Hell isn't a bad place to be, at least for th famous corpse bride who wishes to live forever with Victor. But the latter can't accept this and is determined at all costs to marry Victoria. Alas! Because they believe Victor dead, they want her to marry an unscrupulous rich man. The story is rather linear but filled with effective visual ideas, genteel humor and an indispensable dose of emotion (I must profess that I was moved when Victor was offered his cute little skeleton dog as a wedding present). And Tim Burton once said that monsters weren't so scary and felt lonely and sad. It's what we could put forward with the corpse bride who only wants to be happy through wedding.This film could be 'Beetlejuice''s son because of the manner Tim Burton represents us death. I will just regret an end made with alacrity. But for the rest: sit and savor one more extra canonical work from an auteur.",9,1,1,18 February 2007
Fargo," fools in the snow
","When it was released in 1996, 'Fargo' met public and especially critical acclaim and collected several rewards. But I think that if the Prize for the Best Directing at the Cannes festival was absolutely justified, on the other hand, Frances McDormand didn't deserve her Oscar in 1997. William H.Macy should have won it. His performance as an hypocritical and dishonest car seller is powerful and unforgettable.What is amazing in 'Fargo' are the landscapes, the sceneries and above all the characters. The Coen brothers said about the movie: ' the landscapes, the sceneries are an integral part of the movie. They are typical of the Midwest as well as the characters with their sensitivity and their mentality'. They know what they are talking about since they come from the Midwest, more precisely from the Minnesota. As a consequence, they must have been at ease by making this thrilling movie.Concerning the characters, they are the subject of a realistic and down-to-earth description. Each of them has a different but not very status-enhancing characteristic: William H.Macy's cues are almost always hesitating, unfinished or unsure, the two gangsters are just silly guys (one of them nearly never talks) and most of the inhabitants including Frances McDormand are narrow-minded. By this way, the Coen brothers wanted to underline their meanness of mind and the fact that they are firmly rooted in their land of the Minnesota.Apart from the characters and although the movie is based on a true story, I am obliged to recognize that the script and the way the movie is designed have nothing new. But nonetheless, the tone is daring, there's black humor cleverly used (notably in bloody moments) that contrasts with a quiet even neutral directing. As for the snowy landscapes, they will later inspire Sam Raimi for 'a simple plan' (1998), a movie as successful as 'Fargo'.'Fargo' is eventually the finest movie made by the Coen brothers and its place in the top 250 is thoroughly justified.",9,30,62,31 January 2004

The Caine Mutiny," Jose Ferrer's arm.
","At the beginning of the trial,the lawyer,played by José Ferrer arrives with a wounded arm:no connection with the story,no affect on the end of the movie, completely gratuitous.So why? In 'the sniper' (1952),there's also a mutilated arm.Some historians of the cinema think it must be Dmytryk's remorse,because he became an informer during the McCarthysm.Some kind of self-punishment.Who knows?Strange indeed.For the movie itself,its only flaws are the bland scenes between the Princeton lad and his squeeze.But everything else is absorbing,and Humphrey Bogart gives one of his best interpretations,acting with his hands (and his famous marbles that were to become almost legendary) as much as with his tormented face.Actually,he almost never stops twitching. Bogart gets good support from Fred MCMurray in a very ambiguous part -did he 'help' Bogart's paranoia?Ferrer would be inclined in favor of this hypothesis-,and Van Johnson.In spite of a conventional last scene,'the Caine mutiny ' leaves a bitter taste in the mouth:where does madness begin?Who is responsible  of Bogart's neurosis?Who are the good guys? Is the villain the one we thought?The last scene between Ferrer and the mutineers bring everything into question.Ambiguity will come back to the fore (particularly in Brando's character)in Dmytryk's subsequent 'the young lions' (1958).",8,8,12,19 January 2002
Cast Away," one...
","After he tackled (with panache) the fantastic cinema with 'What lies Beneath' (2000), Robert Zemeckis decided to shot an adventure movie. The result was 'Cast Away', a simple and bald movie. This film is also the occasion for reunion between Zemeckis and Tom Hanks. After 'Forrest Gump' (1994), Hanks puts himself in Chuck Noland's shoes who is all the contrary of Forrest Gump. He's a man who lives an unrestrained life a bit all over the world. But one day, his life's tumbling down. Indeed, following a plane crash, he finds himself on a desert island somewhere in the Pacific ocean. Now, he must get organized...Robert Zemeckis' movie is in itself a respectable achievement. It's especially worth for Hanks' awesome performance. He's all alone in front of the camera for a very important part of the movie but he got out very well of this difficulty. Then, dialogs are rare, music is nearly absent but Zemeckis managed in holding the spectator's attention for all the movie. Moreover, he knows what he's doing and in spite of the length of the movie, you don't get bored.'Cast away' is a movie that even exudes a certain humor. You have to see Tom Hanks's face and behavior in front of his new (and embarrassing) situation on the island.This movie is a little masterstroke and ranks among Zemeckis' best movies.",Null,1,2,15 November 2003
Armageddon," so as Def Leppard said 'armageddon it!' (the movie)
","Two movies: 'the fifth element', 'armageddon'. The same subject: to save the world. The same main actor: Bruce Willis. One difference: 'Armageddon' is very inferior to Luc Besson's film. Some spectacular special effects don't succeed in hiding a labored and globally conventional screenplay. Several parts of the movie are showing it. I think about the president's speech and especially Willis' relationship with his daughter, 'Grace'. At the beginning of the movie, he tends to neglect and overprotect her and this makes her weary. Then, at the end of the movie, it's true love and understanding that shine in him. On another hand, the movie falls in the following trap: Michael Bay takes his subject too seriously. Of course, the movie tries to be funny but the result doesn't work as the humor introduced in the movie is often crude and pretty low-level whereas in the 'fifth element', the humor was zany, involuntary and enabled to overlook the serious side of the action. The movie suffers from two other handicaps: it often falls into the ridiculous (the Russian astronaut) and almost all the actors are bad used. Bruce Willis is all the contrary of his 'fifth element''s character. He plays the he-man, he hams it up and sometimes, he's unbearable. The other actors are barely credible in their own roles, particularly, Willis' sinking crew. It seems that this crew is here just for having fun. One of them is taken for being very qualified but he looks like a fool. And poor Liv Tyler! She's at the NASA just to be decorative.When the movie was released in France in August 1998, Bruce Willis expressed is weariness of saving the world. His weariness was probably justified by this spectacular but poor movie.",1,7,16,5 January 2003
The Village," a forest... (the Cure)
","SPOILERS...Because of great movies shot these last years such as the indispensable 'the Sixth Sense' (1999), a new film by M Night Shyamalan is always eagerly awaited. After 'Signs' (2002), 'the Village' was launched in 2004 and oddly, it somewhat disappoints without we know very well why. You come out of the projection with a certain bitter taste. Why?However, a spectator who would neglect the qualities that this film contains would be someone with a lack of judgment. M Night Shyamalan's making is still as sumptuous and his work is scattered with strong moments like the scene when Adrien Brody wounds Joaquin Phoenix. Moreover, the director often succeeds in making us jump. There's also a magnificent photography that reflects well the colors of the fall and it is quite easy to detect in the nocturnal sequences a careful work on the light. To go on, 'the Village' has got two common point with Shyamalan's previous work, 'Signs': a will to use special effects at a minimum and the fact that this village is located in the heart of a deep forest supposedly haunted really gives the impression to be 'In Camera', just like in 'Signs' with Mel Gibson's farm. At last, to write his screenplay, we can conclude that the director, in the first part, essentially drew from 'Witness' (1985), a movie by Peter Weir while the second part when Bryce Dallas Howard disappears into the woods, quite obviously recalls 'the Blair Witch Project' (1999). All these assets reveal M Night Shyamalan's will to distinguish himself very clearly from the Hollywood influence. All of this would be perfect if there weren't any faults and sadly there are some in this film.First, Shyamalan couldn't avoid one of the traps that the topic was tending: the stereotyped characters, it is the case with Adrien Brody whom we can consider the mad man of the village. Then, one of the strongest points in the previous works shot by this talented filmmaker partly lied on excellent performances from all the actors which created a sort of harmony. In 'the Village', I must admit that the performance remains patchy: William Hurt and Bryce Dallas Howard manage well but Joaquin Phoenix is rather inexpressive. As for Sigourney Weaver, I read that she was so much excited by the script that she had sleepless nights but I think she has only a minor role. Furthermore, the beginning of the film is labored in the way the director lingers on the presentation of the main characters in the village which delays the beginning of the plot.Now what to say about the outcome? Like Alfred Hitchcock, M Night Shyamalan understood that in a detective film to make the suspense last, nothing must be disclosed until the end of a film, the surprise will only be bigger. Besides, he had insisted that the journalists didn't reveal the end of the story. Personally, I can't make up my mind whether the outcome is stunning or poor. In a way, it is stunning if you take care of what Hurt says at the end of the movie and so, the whole story makes sense. But it can also be considered as poor for the spectators who expected to watch a fantastic movie and it can explain why most people felt disappointment about 'the Village'. On IMDB, the popularity rating is only 6,4 out of 10.But we can opt for another interpretation. Maybe M Night Shyamalan wanted to play with the spectator and to laugh at him by leading him on wrong tracks and revealing him that the supposedly haunted forest is just a pure invention from William Hurt. Roughly, the film can be taken for a farce.You will be able, according to your mood, find the end of the movie and even the whole movie, clever or poor. One last thing, there's no denying that in spite of plenty of obvious qualities, M Night Shyamalan's works are getting less and less appealing. I can only wish this: that he recovers",7,7,13,24 August 2004
American Psycho," John Cale imitates Herrmann.
","I have always admired John Cale, as a former Velvet Underground member and as a solo artist.Here he gives us his Hermann act ,and much of the score recalls the strident brilliance of 'Psycho' ,notably during the scene Bale joins the gay golden boy in the bathroom .Of course,it does not match Bernard Herrmann's magnum opus,but anyway who could surpass him?MINOR SPOILER As for the movie,it's a pretty disappointing menu:Bale overplays and we've already seen that,much better,with Jack Nicholson.His character is obnoxious ,a spoilt child (don't we learn he was born silver spoon in hand,his father owning the company for which he 'works'?).There's the obligatory coup de théâtre (à la 'the sixth sense' or 'fight club' ) :it's not what you thought it was .I begin to get tired of these 'unexpected' endings.Dafoe,the beest actor of the movie is wasted  with his part of an almost colomboesque detective.",4,5,13,6 September 2003
The Patriot," the way that leads to freedom
","This is the film-maker of 'Independence Day', Roland Emmerich who made this historic adventures movie which the action takes place in the eighteenth century during the Independence War of the United States. Emmerich manages rather well from this epic movie. Anyway, the result is better than the conceited 'Independence Day'. This is a movie rather well made and careful, especially at the level of the (bloody) sequences fight.There's also an honorable performance that owes a lot to Mel Gibson, brave and lucid when it's necessary. Heath Ledger, eager to join the army so as to defend his country against the English soldiers. On the other hand, Tchéky Karyo isn't equal to his role. I'm under the impression that he was hired only to make the spectator remember that the USA gained their independence with a little help from the French. Otherwise, he isn't really equal to the performance and he's there just to be decorative.It's also obvious that the screenplay was inspired of several movies. You think about 'the Last of the Mohicans' when Gibson sets an ambush in order to set his elder son free. But also 'Robin Hodd', and above all 'Braveheart'. However, the screenplay doesn't succeed in hiding a certain manicheism: sadistic English soldiers face Americans settlers filled with good feelings. You can also notice a shy but pointless presence of humor. At last, you find in this movie, some beloved subjects to American movies: strained relationships between a father and his sons but an unexpected event will bring them closer (here, it's war). But also, the difficult choice to join the army, the question of the honor and revenge.This movie only relates a minor episode of the Independence War. In spite of its weaknesses and its slight lack of inspiration, this is an epic movie, sometimes violent but never boring.",7,0,8,23 March 2003
Edward Scissorhands," the rise and fall of Edward Scissorhands and the inhabitants of a small town
","You could have thought that Tim Burton would rest on his laurels, following 'Batman''s huge commercial success. Well, not at all. 'Edward Scissorhands' appears like a more serious, more mature and even touching movie. This modern fairy tale links skilfully elements from the basic fairy tale (the castle) and elements from the social life (Peg's job as representative for a cosmetics firm) and it can be divided into two parts: the first one that epitomizes Edward's rise: thanks to his scissorhands that give him gifts as a hairdresser and a gardener, he becomes the idol of the town. The second one that shows Edward's fall, following a burglary in which he was inconveniently involved in, he becomes the town's bête noire (and the movie becomes painful) Tim Burton tells this modern fairy tale by introducing a lot of poetry, and during his movie, he tries to create an aesthetic beauty and he succeeds in, especially with the gardens of the castle, Edward's sculptures and Edward himself is good-looking in spite of his scissorhands. But 'Edward Scissorhands' is also a movie of contrasts. There's an obvious contrast between the brightly coloured town and the dark rooms of the castle but also one between the bright town and its inhabitants who are scornful or mocking. Besides, they're the object of a satire of the actual society and Burton tries to underline its weaknesses. Of course, the inhabitants appreciate Edward but only for his gifts. Otherwise, they're mistrustful towards him because, in their eyes, he's different and eccentric (you could be one of the inhabitants!) and the single mistake (the burglary) can lead to unexpected consequences... Whereas Johnny Depp, he's simply extraordinary and finds here, one of his best roles. He provides to his character, a lot of tenderness, affection and above all, a deep sensitivity. At last, Tim Burton knew skilfully how to blend several cinematographic styles in just one film. In 'Edward Scissorhands', you find everything: comedy, fantastic, horror and drama. Moreover, Danny Elfman's gothic music is widely gorgeous to create an intense emotion. It's sometimes difficult to hold his tears... All in all, a movie which is both tender, cruel and Tim Burton's best movie after 'Ed Wood'.",9,80,91,1 February 2003
Spider-Man," A major return to form for Sam Raimi after the disappointing 'the Gift' (2000)
","Adaptations of comics for the screen have become one of Hollywood's main specialties. So far, most of super-heroes for their transition to the screen were entitled to a reliable film-maker and not to a director of musical video clips. Thus, Tim Burton shot 'Batman' in 1989 while Bryan Singer amazed with his movie 'X-Men' (2000). Here, it is Sam Raimi who decided to adapt the adventures of Spider-Man; a plan he surely undertook with joy. Indeed, this iconoclastic film-maker is an avid fan of the comic strip. So, he seemed to be cut out more than anyone else for the film. A surprise: his work doesn't disappoint and maintains itself high above the expectations and is incredibly exhilarating. The movie has been a (largely deserved) triumphant success and for Sam Raimi it was his long-awaited commercial breakthrough. Maybe it wasn't such a bad thing for him to have moved in the Hollywood mainstream.Why is 'Spider-Man' so successful? Simply because Raimi hired a winning team at all levels. First, Raimi's making reflects the enthusiasm he felt to shot his movie. Full of energy, liveliness, it doesn't leave a minute's rest to the spectator. We are carried away by the adventures of Peter Parker/Spider-Man with a lot of frenzy and happiness. It is useful to note down that at the end of the projection, you feel so happy that you ask for more! To come back to Raimi's making, there's a perfect marriage between impressive action sequences and the interesting psychological portrait Raimi makes of his main character. On another hand, the indispensable amounts of humor and emotion haven't been forgotten.Congratulations to the scriptwriter David Koepp. Why didn't he get an Oscar for his work? He has written a watertight screenplay which is flawless. It does everything to remain faithful to the original comic strip. More important, Koepp conceived his script, mainly as a kind of apprenticeship. Peter Parker will test the extent of his powers (first against one of his rivals in his high school, then during a wrestling fight) before putting his red and blue suit on and facing violence in New York and eventually the Green Buffoon (Im not sure if it's the right name).A brilliant screenplay wouldn't be anything without a suitable cast. It is of an impeccable quality. Thanks to 'Spider-Man' Tobey McGuire probably finds the role of his life. At last a role at the extent of his talent. Beside him, Kirsten Dunst has such an appealing charm that it is difficult to resist her. Willem Dafoe is just amazing in his role of wicked. As for JK Simmons, he may have a short role but each of his apparitions is a delight so much that he nearly steals the show to the other actors.But special effects aren't always subtle or sometimes a little too intrusive and David Koepp has forgotten to remove a few clichés about his main character, notably at the beginning of the film. But fortunately, they are tiny details and if we ignore them, 'Spider-Man' appears as a blockbuster whose homogeneity is impressive. It satisfies both the fans of the comic strip but also movie lovers. Raimi's masterpiece lasts about two hours. Not a minute is too much in it. You can't refuse such an exciting show like this one. The second part of the adventures of Spider-Man was launched in the summer 2004 with the same crew and was equally successful as the first one. As we say: we don't change a winning team.Well done Mr Raimi!",9,3,11,22 December 2004
Collateral," Tom Cruise + Michael Mann = a tepid thriller
","Max (Jamie Foxx) is a taxi driver in Los Angeles and works mainly at night. It's a nine to five work reversed as far as the time is concerned. A humdrum life which he dreams of escaping. One night, after he took a lovely black lawyer, he accepts the alluring offering of 600 dollars from a weird, cynical customer, Vincent (Tom Cruise) to go and stop at five different places where he has meetings. But during the first one, a corpse falls on Max's cab and reveals him the true nature of his customer. He's a serial killer and the taxi driver has no other choice than to obey him.Public made an ovation to this 'Collateral' in September 2004 and users on this site seem to like this movie very much. I have mixed feelings about this thriller made Michael Mann who is certainly an American director to remember with works like 'Heat' (1995) or 'the Insider' (1999). It's true that it's suspenseful as one could wish and there are twists, a good dose of fighting, shooting sequences in store to keep the aficionados of the thriller happy. The backdrop, Los Angeles at night adds to the unsettling aura the film tries to convey. Besides the fans of the film would rejoice more if they could watch it all lights turned off. Mann is also certainly a technical virtuoso with prime camera work. So what could possibly go wrong?Well several drawbacks. First the choice of Tom Cruise. In spite of his commendable efforts to try to convince the audience that he can act a cast against type role (here a serial killer) with gray hair to show that he has grown up, it doesn't really work. Several actors had contemplated to do the same thing, that is to say to get out of their ordinary roles commonly attributed to them. Some have succeeded like Brad Pitt in 'Fight Club' (1999) or Jeff Daniels in Clint Eastwood's 'Blood Work' (2002) but other failed like Robin Williams in Christopher Nolan's 'Insomnia' (2002). Cruise definitely enters this second category. He's also almost totally bland but his partner Jamie Foxx is better than him. And the film goes unravel because of some sequences in the taxi. In these moments, Cruise explains to Foxx his motivations for his actions and what he learns from these lessons. In short, the scenarist inserted dialogs that were supposed to be 'deep' and 'meaningful' but I don't find them truly convincing. And some of his traits is exaggerated. As Max says: 'did you have to kill this cop who was married with children?' And when the story starts to stagnate, Mann boosts the interest again with far-fetched tricks. It's better illustrated in the sequence when Foxx starts to speed up and they have a car crash. Cruise absconds to fulfill his last contract. Max, meanwhile discovers the identity of this last person and... I'd better stop here but I think the end of Max's nightmare smells the reheated and doesn't really redeem Mann's work. His film is also marred by unlikeliness.Does 'Collateral' does the job it was made for? Yes but that's all. If you're not too demanding and if you have time to kill on an evening in front of the telly, this might be your cup of tea. Otherwise, pass by.",5,2,10,29 April 2006
Control," Anton Corbijn's magnum opus says it all: he has kept control!
","As a keen music lover I had to discover this gem made by a celebrated photograph in the history of rock: he made photographs of Tom Waits, Captain Beefheart and was responsible for the package of R.E.M.'s Automatic For The People (1992). Without mentioning the remarkable clips he shot for Depeche Mode (see the stunning video of Enjoy The Silence). But above all Anton Corbijn knew very well the members of Joy Division during their short lifetime so he was THE man to shoot their story and the result is just terrific. Its award of the Golden Camera at the festival of Cannes in 2007 was highly deserved.Corbijn shot almost everything that made Joy Division unique in the history of rock and their story is a perfect snapshot of the musical climate of that time. The end of the seventies saw the explosion of punk and new wave.But is it righteous to say that Corbijn was merely interested in the history of the band? Not really. Of course, sequences dealing with them abound and they're unforgettable. See the admirable sequences dealing with the recording of Closer (1980) and the line pronounced by maverick producer Martin Hannett: 'Ian, you're a genius' or the concerts during which epilepsy seizures Ian and makes him plunge into despair. But Corbijn was mostly interested in the history of the leader of Joy Division. In a way, his fate is comparable to Kurt Cobain's: both were married and became fathers too soon. Both were devastated by success. But unlike Nirvana's leader, Curtis was torn between his love for his wife and his mistress and couldn't deal with this forbidden love. Furthermore, as it was written before, his epilepsy seizures made him vulnerable and frail making his suicide predictable. All of this is shot in a rigorous (the listening of Iggy Pop's The Idiot, 1977 before the act...) and especially discreet manner so that we can fully sympathize with Ian Curtis' plight. And it works for the last minutes are very harrowing. I must say I shed a tear at that time of the film.Then Corbijn didn't forget his science of photography during the making of his film for several shots are carefully filmed making them look like photographs. And needless to say that the actor acting Curtis is highly convincing, just like the rest of the cast.In the end, I can't really write faults about a highly emotive biopic and when a style is perfectly adapted to a type of story, it can work wonders unlike the failed biopic about Serge Gainsbourg released in January 2010.",9,1,1,24 April 2010
Ocean's Eleven," Soderbergh's good movie
","I think that 'Ocean's eleven' is an overrated movie (7.5 out of 10 on imdb) but it's nonetheless a pleasant movie. It goes down well thanks to a clever and often inventive directing, smart dialogs and a well-run troop of actors. George Clooney dominates the cast. Steven Soderbergh's movie also enjoys a screenplay that is well put together. Perhaps a little too well put together because it's hard to follow Clooney' operation and there are details that can escape your attention.A good movie but not a masterpiece.",5,0,2,21 September 2003
Pearl Harbor," you'd better study the Pearl Harbor tragedy in history books!
","Made by the same crew that delivered us 'Armageddon' (1998), 'Pearl Harbor' is a much less stupid movie than its predecessor and a more ambitious one. You find the actor Ben Affleck in both movies but he's better in 'Pearl Harbor' than in 'Armageddon' because he manages to avoid third-rate acting. It isn't sufficient enough to make 'Pearl Harbor' one of the finest movies made in 2001 because Michael Bay's movie contains a quite important number of faults. Michael Bay wanted obviously to give to his movie a Hollywood extent and as a consequence it makes the film uninteresting. Moreover this is an unoriginal film because it borrows several sequences or ideas from other movies. For example, as it was the case with 'Titanic' (1997), Bay chose to shoot the Pearl Harbor tragedy through the love affair between Kate Beckinsale and Josh Hartnett but this couple can't make the couple DiCaprio-Winslet forget. In short, this device appears colorless.But the Hollywood side of the movie can be seen at the special effects level. The action sequences are certainly impressive but they are crushed by special effects (when Affleck and Hartnett pilot fighter planes against Japanese pilots, you feel that you are inside a video game!).From a historical point of view, the movie only suggests an academic vision of the Pearl Harbor tragedy and we learn nothing new.Nevertheless when the film focuses on the very moving hospital sequences, Michael Bay knows how to create emotion.At the end, the whole gives a heterogeneous, shaky and conventional movie.",Null,11,20,6 December 2003
The Usual Suspects," the American thriller of the nineties
","One day in a bookshop, I flipped through a book entitled: 'the movies of the nineties' and this movie wasn't included! How can a book specialized in cinema skip such a milestone of the last decade? Any movie buff, any cinema critic must have considered the nineties a fruitful era for the American thriller. According to one's tastes, some will say that the best thriller of the nineties is 'Silence of the Lambs' (1991). For others it will be 'Pulp Fiction' (1994) while others will praise to the skies 'Se7en' (1995). For me, the pinnacle is this present movie, 'the Usual Suspects' (1995) with its staggering story (to put it mildly). It's a sensational debut for Bryan Singer which enabled to put him on the map. With a little help from his accomplice Christopher McQuarrie, he signed an unparalleled gem in the landscape of the American thriller, even the whole cinema.The average viewer who watches 'the Usual Suspects' for the first time might think that the whole crew concocted him a meandering story with as a leading thread, Spacey's convoluted story. At the end of the projection, he may feel puzzled and will probably wish to watch the movie a second time. He won't regret it and Singer and McQuarrie will rejoice at it. Their masterwork gains by several repeated viewings to appreciate the subtleties of a rich movie with a convoluted construction which will take its seemingly definitive form in the five last minutes. To watch 'the Usual Suspects' is like gathering the pieces of an intriguing puzzle, a little like any other suspenseful movie but in the case of Singer's flick, one will never really be able to completely end it. So many things happen in less than two hours that we are never really sure of what we watch and this is reinforced by a breathtaking unexpected twist at the end which makes our assumptions falter. Singer and McQuarrie take a mischievous delight in taking the viewer in their nebulous scenario and to follow it according to Spacey's declarations and it's obvious that they raise more questions than answers. It's up to the viewer to make his imagination work and to bring his thoughts on the film. This is what inspires its pernicious charm.From Spacey's story, the authors developed a top quality script, set with clockwork precision. Singer's directorial style virtually evolutes on the razor's edge and conveys an increasing tension. It is filled with ingenious visual ideas and served by fluid camera movements. Singer was in his early thirties when he shot his film but it presents the signs of a seasoned author. There's also a tight editing and a unsettling score which cement the movie in its place of winner. More remarkable, the authors pull off with gusto to increase the audience's curiosity throughout the film in spite of a somewhat deliberate confusion and the interest won't weaken until the end which constitute the apex: an unexpected twist which will leave the audience speechless once they understood it. In Singer's flick, it doesn't disappoint because there are little but noticeable visual and verbal clues which justify it. However, it has something unsettling. We believe that we are at the end of the maze but there's more to the picture than meets the eye. Maybe this 'coup de theatre' veils one more truth. Maybe also the shrewdest ones will have guessed it but the result is the same for any viewer: Singer puts a baffled spectator in his pocket.Singer and Quarrie show a perfect master in the domain of the film noir: an ominous atmosphere, nocturnal scenes which stay rooted in the mind and a deep psychology of certain characters which give more substance to the film. Considering the last point, the character of Gabriel Byrne is the most interesting one: a former crooked cop who seemingly redeemed himself in catering but caught up by his past and forced to come back to work. I personally think that Byrne is the stand-out of the topflight cast the movie boasts. But don't neglect the other members. Kevin Spacey pocketed a deservedly Oscar in 1996 and the rest of the cast doesn't stay on the bench. Maybe Singer grants a little shallow attention to the three others baddies in the gang but in a way it's necessary to underscore the fact that they're lousy gangsters embroiled in a infernal spiral and unable to perceive what lies beneath all this. Pete Postlewhaite and Chazz Palminteri make their scenes count too.A riveting storytelling, a painstaking flash-back, a tight and first-class directing, a thoughtful twist, a topnotch cast, 'the Usual Suspects' includes almost everything a director would sell his soul for. Everything contributes to make it a stalwart model in the suspenseful movie and the whole cinema. After the first vision, be prepared for mental gymnastics and for a second screening...",10,280,346,12 December 2005
Independence Day," space (I believe in)
","One of the biggest hits of the year 1996 (especially in the USA) but certainly not one of the finest science-fiction movies ever made. The sole advantage of the movie rests in the special effects that are really impressive (the gigantic spacecraft). But the assets of Roland Emmerich's movie stop here. Then, 'Independence day' accumulates the faults that damages the interest of the movie. First of all, 'Independence day' wavers constantly between the science-fiction but also the disaster film. But the main problem of the movie is definitely the script. It's a weak and ridiculous script that alternates borrowings: 'Alien' (the physical appearance of the extraterrestrials), 'Star Wars' (the pursuit between the flying saucer and Will Smith's plane), 'the day the Earth stood still' (1951) and homages: 'War of the worlds', 2001: a space odyssey' (when Jeff Goldblum turns on his portable computer, this is 'HAL 9000' that appears on the screen!). In the long run, the movie's got nearly nothing new and it easily falls into the stereotypes of science-fiction. It's hackneyed and not inventive at all.This is also a movie spoiled by an atrocious performance of nearly all the actors, especially the minor roles. Moreover Roland Emmerich's crew wanted to introduce humor so as to avoid to tell too seriously the story. A good idea but the humor doesn't fly high and it's sometimes very crude.An average and pretentious movie.",2,4,10,21 November 2003
Batman Begins," and ends with brilliant results
","'Batman' was created by Bob Kane in 1939 and in the sixties, a wacky version with gaudy colors was shot. The Batman saga was revived by Tim Burton and it started under auspicious skies with the two following novel chapters: 'Batman' (1989) and 'Batman Returns' (1992). With the arrival of Joel Schumacher, the series plumbed. 'Batman Forever' (1995) and 'Batman and Robin' (1997) were real downers which tarnished Batman's reputation. Due to this, Gotham City's most well-known inhabitant took refuge in his den and waited for things to evolute. In the meantime, he was upstaged by other superheroes like 'Spiderman'. Was there a future for Kane's son? Rather than pouncing on the elaboration of a new adventure (at one point, one even talked about the possibility of a story called 'Batman vs Superman'), why not plumping for a streak which has been seizing the Hollywood firm for several years? Just look at the titles of the following works: 'the Exorcist: the Beginning' (2004' or recently 'the Texas Chainsaw Massacre: the Beginning' (2006). These titles give this inkling: to go back to the sources and roots and unearth what made Batman a myth. Like many moviegoers on this site, when I learned that Christopher Nolan was the heir of this work, I felt that the project was in good hands. I'm not a fan of his 'Memento' (2000) but I recognize that he's a canonical filmmaker and this was largely conducive to Batman's rehabilitation.The storyline is apparently slick on the surface, but in depth it conceals several directions. More than half of the storytelling is based on Bruce Wayne's psychological turmoil, His trip in the world to forget the traumatizing death of his parents under his eyes. His apprenticeship and learning to gain trust and knowledge and to try to overcome his demons and to put a term to his weaknesses. As Liam Neeson puts it: 'you are afraid of your own strength'. But eventually, the young man will have recourse to his own fears to fight fear! To admire the hero, you'll have to be very patient for one can't see him before almost the half of the film. The second half which sees the young cape crusader going back to Gotham City to make justice triumph and creating some of his gadgets which cemented his popularity like the 'Batmobile' is more devoted to action sequences. These thrilling moments keep a very reserved feeling to insist that Batman is a flesh and blood protagonist. It is more embellished by a restricted use of special effects. But Nolan and his scenarist didn't put aside rigor and construction. The development of the story is fantastic as one could wish with twists, turns to keep the audience interested. Apparently the scarecrow wants to command Gotham City but the biggest villain isn't necessarily the one you can think of.Even 'Batman Begins' is a typical Hollywood product, it is earmarked of Nolan's touch. The filmmaker deftly introduces flashbacks at the right time and sometimes flashbacks inside flashbacks! And Nolan once said that he liked to oppose the subjectivity of a character to the objectivity of the world. This declaration could make sense in one of the thrusts developed in the film: many inhabitants in Gotham City may think that justice is lost but Bruce Wayne/Batman is back and here to stay to convince them that it's not dead. The setting helps to capture this and Nolan's own ominous vision of the city: a Gotham City shrouded with a gritty urban realism and in which bribery and violence easily propagate due to the power of the underworld. This assumed perspective breaks out in the apocalyptic end of the film which in a certain extent harks back to George Romero's cult film 'the Night of the Living Dead' (1968) with the population wandering in a hazy, artificial fog in the throes of fear and madness. Thanks to Nolan's stringent brio, these different levels in the scenario and in the directorial style are combined to amount to a meshed, well-rounded poise shot without alacrity. An overlong movie (2h 20 minutes) but the length eludes the viewer.For this resurrection of Batman, Nolan gathered a stellar cast. Every actor slips into his or her role in an unselfconscious way. Christian Bale can preen himself on having got the role of his life and he has never been so much better than here. Michael Caine brings a mix of complicity and mischievousness to the butler Alfred and I have a preference for Cilian Murphy whose cynicism and deadly charm have positively devastating effects.For Nolan, the transition from a 'film d'auteur' to a Hollywood blockbuster wasn't knotty at all and even if the whole seems easy, it's very bracing. So thank you Mr. Nolan for having re gilded Batman's credibility. The follow-up is currently under way. Let's hope it will showcase the same high standard of quality.",9,4,6,16 October 2006
Liar Liar," truth hurts...
","Fletcher Reede (Jim Carrey), is a lawyer who is estranged from his wife Audrey (Maura Tierney). His occupations maintain him far from his home and particularly from his son Max. But he really loves him. One day, for his birthday, Max wishes that his father can't lie for 24 hours. His wish will come true since for 24 hours, Reede will be through a living hell. One must suffer to improve oneself...With 'Liar Liar', the authors set themselves the following target: to conceive a tailor-made movie for Jim Carrey. Why? Because they surely realized that their topic was thin and it would pose problems to write a screenplay holding water. So, to compensate for the very reduced potential of the script they decided to give Carrey a free hand and to leave a very important part of the film in his hands. Thus, the actor, once revealed with 'the Mask' (1994) gets out again, without trying to bring anything new to his acting his comical elements that secured his success. It means: his grimaces, his showy expressions and his implausible cues for a kind of one man-show which often borders on the unacceptable. Carrey does his best to bring an ounce of credibility to his character but his bombastic (the term is weak) performance only succeeds in massacring the film. Worse, his third-rate acting is so significant that it leaves little place to the other actors' acting. Actors who try with difficulty to play opposite Carrey.This poor comedy shows once again that exclusively relying on a main actor to save a film can be a serious mistake. Fortunately, it seems that Carrey after this flick wanted to give the image of a conscientious actor capable to direct his career. Indeed, we will see him holding more serious roles where he will be able to restrain his tendency to third-rate acting. Try 'the Truman Show' (1998), 'Man on the Moon' (1999) or more recently 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' (2004). Let's hope he goes on and perseveres in this way.",3,4,13,17 December 2004
Man on the Moon," Andy, did you hear about this one?
","Andy Kaufman was definitely a famous actor in the United States. However, in France, he still remains unrecognized. It was nearly normal that American cinema devotes him a movie. This is Milos Forman who took care of relating Andy's life and the result is a fair success. Forman had the good idea by hiring Scott Alexander and Larry Karasweski to write the screenplay. They wrote the screenplay of 'Ed Wood' by Tim Burton and to write Andy Kaufman's story, they used the same methods as in Tim Burton's movie: they tried to relate Andy's life as precisely as possible and the result works. Besides, you could say that Ed Wood and Andy Kaufman were two characters who had similar points: they wished to impose their talent so as to go down in history, they had weird habits and unfortunately they had an unhappy end of life: they fell badly sick and died.The less we can say is that Andy Kaufman was an uncommon and unpredictable character which shows had surprises in store. They were great 'trompe l'oeil' and used to lead the public astray. Behind the dramatic side of the situations, Kaufman's shows turned out to be loaded and completely made-up. But in spite of his absurd performances, Kaufman used generally to reach his goal: make the public laugh and it showed his original talent. Moreover, Forman introduced a lot of liberty and movements during the shows that sometimes are close to the surrealism.Jim Carrey is rather convincing in his performance and restitutes quite well Andy's personality. He skilfully avoids the third-rate acting. It shows that he's into the hands of a conscientious and serious film-maker who masters his movie. As a conclusion: a fair movie and a quite harsh biography.",7,0,0,27 April 2003
Saving Private Ryan," some upsetting battle sequences for a plain story
","War movies have often been one of Steven Spielberg' specialities. This one achieved a huge public and critic success. What drew the attention in this war movie are fight sequences. They're extremely violent and bloody. We have been rarely so far in the reality of fights. It's difficult to forget the first half an hour of the movie during the Normandy landings. Spielberg's sober and showy directing increases the phenomenon.However, you must admit it, the movie is based on a trite, plain even conventional story. You could use this last word to describe the famous Ryan soldier. Indeed, he's told that he can go home because all his brothers have been killed.

","'La cage aux rossignols' ,released in 1945,was one of the last movies of the occupation days .'Les choristes' ,although they have transposed the action to the fifties,hints at it when a young brat breaks into 'maréchal ,nous voilà!' ,anthem of those dark years.The question is:was it necessary to redo?Yes the songs are splendid and are likely to become part of the repertoire of all the French schools .Yes the boy who plays Morange mesmerizes the audience ,and like Brigitte Fossey ('jeux interdits' ) or Benoit Magimel ('la vie est un long fleuve tranquille' ) he may become an actor when he grows up.The original screenplay has undergone some changes:it has become a long flashback ,with an ending which focuses one more time on success and fame ,borrowing more from 'Professor Holland's opus' than from Dreville's old flick.The rebel pupil's sister has become an unmarried mother,which was unthinkable in the Petain years.Producer Jacques Perrin -who has seen better days,artistically speaking- appears as the umpteenth version of the ugly duckling turned into a swan.And finally the Jugnot vehicle has the same drawbacks as its model:the kids become quickly much too quickly a heavenly choir ,andwe do know that, in both movies ,the young actors are choristers in real life.The characters remain cardboard and Gérard Jugnot is neither better nor worse than Noël-Noël .What's amazing is that generally 'la cage aux rossignols' is dismissed as cheesy and maudlin (its rating is average) whereas its remake is praised to the skies.It's the same old song though.",4,6,17,5 July 2005
The Pianist," Spilzman? What a beautiful name for a pianist...
","In March 2003, Roman Polanski's 'the Pianist' (2002) pocketed three Oscars including best actor (Adrien Brody) and best director (Roman Polanski). One month earlier, the ceremony of the French Oscars showered the movie with praise by attributing to it and his author similar prizes. Earlier in May 2002, the festival of Cannes crowned it of the most prestigious prize: the deservedly Golden Palm. Already in 2002 and chiefly throughout 2003, awards rained on Polanski's deeply moving piece of work and rightly so. It is a true return to form for him after an uneven career which started after the spooky 'the Tenant' (1976) and wildly oscillated between duds (Pirates, 1986, Frantic, 1988) and palatable but not peerless works (Death and the Maiden, 1994, the Ninth Gate, 1999). 'The Pianist' helped to rekindle the flame that made such treasures, hallmarks in their own domains (the wonderful 'Rosemary's Baby', 1968 in the fantastic or the fabulous 'Chinatown', 1974 in the film noir) and could be a stalwart success in the movie with the Second World War as the backdrop. It is perhaps Polanski's most personal film to date and the one he has always wanted to shot, surely to exorcise traumatic memories haunting him since his childhood. Like his main protagonist, Wladyslaw Szpilman, he experienced the horror of the ghetto of Warsaw.To get his demons out of his head, he preferred to adapt for the screen Spilzman's memories, a genius pianist and a man who bit by bit lost his family and friends on whom he could rely, a man who was deprived of his piano and thus of his 'raison d'être'. As Stefan Zweig says: 'to read is to live', well for him 'to play is to live'. Even when he has the opportunity to play, he has to refrain himself. See the scene in which he has settled down to his flat. Before leaving him, the owner says to him: 'please, don't make noise'. Polanski makes us share his craving for playing by putting his main protagonist in front of the sacred instrument ans plays us the music in Spilzman's head without the latter touches the keys. He was also a man who saw sorrow, pain and the unthinkable (the sequences in which German officers and soldiers kill Jewish people give goose pimples because they're precisely unthinkable). Throughout his sufferings, chance didn't totally relinquish him: he was rescued at the last minute by a Polish policeman (and a fellow of his brother) who stopped him from going up in the train of death to Auschwitz. At this moment, he was saved from death but he lost his family. Then, he had to rely on his courage to survive and enjoyed the help of some fellows even if they absconded (the woman Spilzman made the acquaintance at the beginning of the film and her husband who found him a flat). At last, the German officer at the end of the film, was his ultimate glimmer of hope.Roman Polanski shot his film with a classic but startling directing for the sake of detail and realism. It has a linear but inevitable progression which has the look of a downward spiral: the tightening of the restrictions on Jewish people which become increasingly harsher (the armband to distinguish the Jewish from other peoples, then the delimitation and the encircling of the ghetto, the Jews chased away from their neighborhood and deported to the extermination camps) and the least sign of certainty is nearly automatically blighted: 'we have work certificates at last' sighs Spilzman's father. Alas! Hopes blighted since just as he pronounces these words, a German officer asks them with other people to go outside. Some of them are killed while the others (including Spilzman's family) have to wait on a large square with thousands of others. Polanski also relates notable events with a minimum of means (the fight and shooting sequences are often perceived from a balcony or a window).The second part of the film strongly recalls Polanski's murkiest hours extracted from his masterworks. For example, in his flat, Spilzman tries to be as quiet as possible and while searching for food in his kitchen and drops crockery. The noise makes his neighbor intervene and by giving the alarm in the building obliges him to flee once again. At this moment, we find one of Polanski's trademarks: the eerie neighbor who has a harmful influence on the hero and contributes to his or her fall (the Castevet in 'Rosemary's Baby', the offbeat inhabitants of the building in 'the Tenant'. In another extent, when Spilzman has to lurk in the destroyed ghetto (the distant shot where we can see him trudging in the ruins of this apocalyptic landscape deserves to rank among Polanski's most notable shots in all his filmography), Polanski really places us amid a 'in camera' in spite of the sprawling scenery.The filmmaker should also be thanked for having chosen Adrien Brody in the main role. He works wonders in a part which seemed to be tailor-made for him, a far cry from his cardboard character in M Night Shyamalan's 'the Village' (2004). He can act several persona in himself: a smart young man as well as a dirty and bearded tramp. His angular face, his acute and melancholic countenance stay with us for a long time. As for the German officers, they are often caricatured but ultimately Polanski eschews the trap of Manicheism which seemed to pervade the whole film thanks to the last sequences with the sympathetic German officer. Not all Nazis were beasts...Interspersed with either unbearable, either excruciating or either moving sequences and with striking shots, 'the Pianist' has its place on the podium of Polanski's towering achievements. See it any costs! Unfortunately it would seem that the flame began to flicker again given the lukewarm critics 'Oliver Twist' met this year. The slump again? Only time will tell...",10,5,10,29 December 2005
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," it's the same thing as the first movie: worth seeing for its special effects
","The idea of a sequel to the most successful movie made in 1993 stayed rooted in people's minds. Moreover, in the first movie, Sam Neil was astonished by found out that 'dinosaurs are breeding!'. However, scientifics who used to work for the 'jurassic park' had developed a process that had to make the dinosaurs sterile. Apparently, there must have been a mistake or something they didn't think about. But for Spielberg, this carelessness was a kind of excuse to make a follow-up.As far as this sequel is concerned, well it's far from being superior to the first movie. If special effects are always dramatic and successful (you can notice that Spielberg made the effort to diversify the species of dinosaurs), the screenplay is always few inspired. It appears frankly poor in the way it plays the role of fill-in. Must you add that it contains dialogs that sound hollow and labored? And of, course, unlikelinesses are always on meeting. Nevertheless, one positive side: children nearly never appear during the movie.Steven Spielberg chose Jeff Goldblum in the main role (perhaps, he wanted to grant him more liberty and calibre than in the first movie) but he could have chosen as well Sam Neil.On another hand, when the tyrannosaurus invades San Diego (it gives a little ounce of surrealism to the movie), the movie falls into the ridicule. Instead of feeling anxiety or fear, you laugh a lot when you watch the disasters that the tyrannosaurus causes.At last, the end probably ranks among the worst ends of movie ever made. Indeed, it's too easy and conventional to say that we must let dinosaurs live on their island and it gives birth to a childish moral. Besides, the movie globally gives off a feeling of great childishness due to the characters' every moves and thoughts. Especially the clan of wicked people who mean to capture dinosaurs in order to create another 'Jurassic park' in San Diego. A flat and poor sequel. I didn't watch 'Jurassic Park 3' and I don't know what it's worth. When will 'jurassic park 4' be ?",4,2,10,25 April 2003

The Game," A game which isn't like the other ones
","Possible Spoilers...Unlike the acclaimed 'Seven' and 'Fight Club', 'the Game' is a movie by David Fincher which tends to be underrated. But I still think that it's as stunning as the two quoted movies. Maybe the beginning of the movie doesn't see any good coming because Fincher used an outline used until one can't take any more: a well-off and strong man (Michael Douglas) who hides a terrible secret. For his birthday, his brother (Sean Penn) offers him a game designed by a mysterious firm and he accepts. From this moment, the movie takes an unexpected shape. Indeed, strange things happen in Douglas' surround. Has the game begun? Is Douglas' life in danger?The movie is so well made that you believe it's a real thriller. It means that not only is this game a beautiful 'trompe l'oeil' but it also might be something else like for example a conspiracy against Michael Douglas that aims at making him fall. Moreover, can we really call it a game? There are no rules and Douglas almost died several times. Thankfully, the end  will make him come back down to earth by revealing him the simple truth: it was just a game, nothing else and he won. As it was the case with his previous movie, Fincher wrote a disturbing and diabolic screenplay in spite of a few unlikelinesses (at the end of the movie, Douglas tries to commit suicide by falling from a very high building). On another hand, his command of the directing isn't necessary to prove and sustain continuously the interest.After 'Seven', he persists and scores and if for your next birthday one of your close relatives offers you a similar game to the movie, guess what you'll do...",Null,0,2,6 June 2003
The Man Who Would Be King," King Huston
","This movie seems to have been made by a young man.It took the adventure genre to its peak ( it was to be cheapened by Spielberg in the eighties with I.Jones and co).The screenplay is marvelous,now funny ,now dramatic,now parodic ,now epic.John Huston runs the whole gamut of emotion,suspense and humor.Abetted by two peerless actors,he tells us a tale so weird that only a first-rate director could have pulled it off. A metaphor on the power,on man's conceit (wasn't it the case for such early gems as 'Sierra Madre' or late masterpieces like 'the dead'?),a conceit that knows no bounds.Actually,Connery's character doesn't want to be a king,he wants to be adored and worshipped as a God.(In a famous scene,he asks Caine to bow low before him;it's comic admittedly,but it's a dark spooky humor:in a nutshell,the 'Divinity' is losing His mind) Comedy and tragedy walk hand in hand is this subtile work.See how Connery's imposture is being found.Then we have the sublime final confrontation Connery/Caine ,when the former is to be executed.It's difficult to hold back your tears! And as for the very end of the movie,when Caine returns,it's more terrifying than the whole of 'the exorcist'.'Vanity of vanities,all is vanity' Huston seems to whisper in the gloom.",10,7,12,26 June 2001
Meet Joe Black," Meet with boredom...
","Remake of a movie launched in 1934 and whose name was 'Death takes a holiday', 'Meet Joe Black' must be very inferior to the original movie although I didn't see it. This is the typical movie with a good idea but badly exploited. Here, death is epitomized by a good-looking young man (Brad Pitt) and he'd like to know why men dread so much death. He's settling down in the life of a well-off man (Anthony Hopkins) and his daughter falls in love with Pitt.'Meet Joe Black' is a movie whose result isn't convincing at all. The screenplay is very repetitive with annoying cues (Pitt who often asks for peanut butter) and contains a few weaknesses like Pitt's weird car crash at the beginning of the movie. Besides, this is probably one of Pitt's weakest performances to date. He leans too much on his physical appearance and I find him too inexpressive.It's also a movie that is terribly long-winded and it drags on. A flat and listless film-making doesn't help matters. It focuses too much on the actors' faces as if it wanted to define their feelings.At last, this is an overlong movie and in three hours you find time to be bored because nearly nothing's happening.

Million Dollar Baby," long live Clint Eastwood!
","Hardly one year after the shady 'Mystic River' (2003), 'grandad' Clint Eastwood changes mood and perseveres with 'Million Dollar Baby' (2004), an unusual film about women's boxing which presents none sign of quieting down from the former cowboy and 'dirty Harry'. He once said about his movies that they had to be before all: entertaining and compelling. Given the commercial and critical enthusiasm of his work, he well fulfilled his pledges.On the paper, 'Million Dollar Baby' nearly looks like any success story, a genre that American cinema has a liking for. Maggie Fitzerald (Hilary Swank) is a 31 year-old woman who works as a waitress in a restaurant. Perfectly aware that her life isn't much worth, she only sees boxing to find a way in life. With the help of an old coach Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) and after weeks of intense training, she knows a meteoric rise with fame and glory under her belt. But Clint Eastwood is a too demanding author to content himself to shot this kind of story and is ready to go beyond it to get more interested in the relationship between Maggie and his character Frankie. As a matter of fact, 'Million Dollar Baby' diverts codes of the boxing world and success story to develop a touching friendship story between two opposite characters that will peak in the last wrenching third of the film. One the one hand, Maggie Fitzerald, ready to do anything to become the best woman boxing. She sees in Frankie Dunn, the perfect coach and eventually a father figure to enable her to reinforce her trust in herself. On the other hand, Frankie Dunn, an irascible old man whose life has especially been a series of disappointments and who tries to find a hope in redemption (I think the somewhat dreary scenery of the gymnasium reflects well his temper). But in reality, he hides a golden heart and perceives Maggie as the daughter he hasn't had but would have liked to. To tell this absorbing story of an unlikely friendship, Eastwood uses pure film-making basics: a straight-forward narrative line, lovable characters and a calm directing without exaggerations. The whole is tinged with a huge tenderness and a humor of quality to which it is impossible to resist. And just like in 'Unforgiven' (1992), to hear a few guitar notes is better than a whole classical music orchestra.A new variation of the American dream, a praise to courage and perseverance, a just description of the boxing world, a poignant father-daughter relationship. 'Million Dollar Baby' combines all these things. With this monument of emotion, Clint Eastwood is really at the peak of his art. It probably won't be his last movie but one thing is sure: by getting old, he improves and currently shots better than ever. It's simple, genuine and moving cinema at its best and no wonder it seduced the jury at the Oscars ceremony earlier this year by awarding it 4 Oscars including best actress (Hilary Swank) and best director (Clint Eastwood).",10,8,13,26 April 2005
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," an apparently trivial story transcended in a stylish treatment
","'One of these days, I'm going to cut you into little pieces' (Pink Floyd, One of These Days, Meddle, 1971).I have often written in some reviews on this site that I wasn't a big fan of Quentin Tarantino, a cinema-going filmmaker with a mind-boggling culture. It's true that I have never been very taken with 'Pulp Fiction' (1994). As for 'Kill Bill: Vol. 1', I had deemed it as 'violent and hollow'. I maintain the first epithet but I jettison the second one now. I watched it again last Saturday night with its other brother 'Kill Bill: Vol. 2' (that I hadn't seen before) and I changed my mind about it. I realized that I had overlooked it and I would go as far as saying that I found it much better than Tarantino 1994 film.The staple story doesn't carry much weight. A wedding in the desert takes a tragic dimension when all the guests are killed except the Bride who spends four years in a coma. When she wakes up, she's got one sole word in her mind: revenge. On a scrap of paper, she noted down the names of the ones who made of her wedding a tragedy and is well determined to kill them all. She also keeps the best for the end: Bill. This story is for Tarantino almost a pretext to beef it up with sources coming from different horizons: comic strip, spaghetti western, samurai film and even video games in the elaboration of the fight sequences. And animated by a cinema passion, the filmmaker couldn't resist to the desire to include film-loving details throughout the Bride's adventures. Thus, the title of the second chapter is entitled if my memory serves me well: 'the Bride wore blood'. It's of course a hint at François Truffaut's film, 'la Mariée Etait en Noir' (1968), a film on which Truffaut himself didn't have a warm spot. I have just mentioned the term chapter since the film and its companion are divided into chapters and Tarantino isn't afraid of subverting storytelling conventions by showcasing chapters in a chronological disorder like his previous efforts.The technical command of 'Kill Bill: Vol 1.' leaves speechless. First, I would like to congratulate Tarantino for the cinematography he tapped. It enhances bright colors, especially the red and one thing I noticed: in the first sequence of the film, Uma Thurman drives a vehicle with red seats. In Jean-Luc Godard's 'Pierrot Le Fou' (1965), the red is also a dominating color. In one scene, Jean Paul Belmondo and Anna Karina are in a car with red seats. If I don't understand at all the symbolical function of the red in Godard's highbrow work, in Tarantino's work, his symbolic is blatant according to the story and the Bride's motivations. Red is revenge, violence, death.This revenge story is filmed with virtuosity to its recesses where nothing is left to chance. It's tempting to deem the introduction of some characters as filler but it's necessary to reveal and consolidate their persona. And throughout these chapters, Tarantino taps all the cinematographic possibilities to bestow and embellish the form to the service of his intentions (to pay homage to the samurai film among others) and the contents. Thus, one of the moments of the film is showcased under the form of a Japanese cartoon film and for perhaps one of the most momentous moments (the scene when the BRie kills some 80 masked enemies, Tarantino borrowed a device from Hitchcock he used in his mind-boggling 'Psycho' (1960): to shot an incredibly violent fight sequence in black and white not to show the red blood. Besides and while I'm on this sequence as well as the others that involve fights, they are so well choreographed and set with clockwork precision that they can emulate, even outclass the ones of 'the Matrix' saga. And as many film buffs know it, one of Tarantino's recognizable signs is his pronounced taste for bloody violence. For 'Kill Bill: Vol. 1', he didn't shelve it but this violence is virtually all blood and thunder and watching ripped or pierced body parts or whole bodies, slashed arms and legs becomes highly great fun. Thrill-seekers will be overjoyed and the height is reached when the Bride before facing Lucy Liu declares to them: 'don't try to get back your missing parts!'.Tarantino even grants some importance to some apparently trivial things like for instance the Japanese man who sells to the Bride a clean saber writes on the mist of a window, the one whom the Bride wants to get rid of at the end of her list (you guessed who it is of course) or when the Bride tries to move her big toe after her coma.It's exciting cinema as one could wish and for Tarantino whose target was partly to pay homage to the samurai movies with which he grew up, he delivered the goods: to spend a truly great cinema moment. The different cinematographic devices and tricks interlock with easiness and fluidity. What about my judgment of the volume 2? The answer in my review about it.NB: there's perhaps this unlikeliness in Tarantino's scenario. When the Bride gets out of the hospital and finds herself in the underground parking, thirteen hours pass by before she can feel her feet again. But during this time the staff at the hospital must have realized her departure. Why don't they find her again after such a long time? It's a minor detail.",9,0,5,11 August 2006

From Dusk Till Dawn," the unlikely marriage of 'Pulp Fiction' (1994) and 'Evil Dead' (1981)
","Sourced from a story Quentin Tarantino penned in his youth and dusted off in the wake of the 'Pulp Fiction' impact, this Robert Rodriguez effort achieves this incredible hybrid. I must say I am uneven about the two authors of these credentials. For Tarantino, I thoroughly enjoyed 'Kill Bill: Volume I and II' (2003/2004) and at a pinch 'Reservoir Dogs' (1992) but 'Pulp Fiction' isn't in my straitjacket of the most memorable movies made in the nineties. As for Sam Raimi, the 'Evil Dead' saga hasn't got a prominent place in my favorite horror movies but 'a Simple Plan' (1998) and the adventures of Peter Parker/Spider-Man gave me a positive side from him.I could have the same judgment about Rodriguez himself: I saw 'the Faculty' (1999) when it was theatrically released and I forgot all about it. Ditto for 'Sin City' (2005) which was visually a black splendor but I don't remember much about the story. On the positive side, 'From Dusk Till Dawn' entertained me until the last shot. It's cut in two distinct parts. The first one has more the look of a road-movie imbued with thriller with stunts, shootings, corpses galore and a dash of suspense. It's the part I favor the most. The second half of the film changes territory and takes a leap into the gore movie sourced from the eighties with blood, special effects to satisfy the genre. There is also a little of George A. Romero's masterwork 'the Night of the Living Dead' (1968) and I do think this part is weaker than the first. The action becomes a bit sluggish and special effects are sometimes too intrusive. But perhaps, it was an inescapable rule to this kind of story.The amount is a film rooted in two different cinematographic genres and if it's a little hard to swallow, it means to jump on a genre while jettisoning the other, Rodriguez's effort has positive things in its contents to have a good time. Sequences are shot with care and shrewdness like the very first one. Like in 'Reservoir Dogs', we won't properly see the bloody break-in but just verbal facts from the characters and the TV. It is also permitted to hail Tarantino for his sharp dialogs. My favorite lines are when George Clooney and Tarantino take Harvey Keitel and his son hostage and Juliette Lewis arrives in the room from the swimming pool:<ul><li>What's, um, going on? - We're having a bikini contest and you just won.</li></ul>Later in the van on the road that leads to Mexico:<ul><li>Where are you taking us? - Mexico - What's in Mexico? - Mexicans.</li></ul>Black humor shouldn't be neglected like the sequence when the journalist says the increasing number of killed people after the hold-up. And the actors seem to have fun as much as we do, notably Clooney and Tarantino in psychopathic killers who shoot first and ask themselves questions then.This B movie won't cater for all tastes for evident reasons but as it is painstakingly made as a whole, the alliance Rodriguez/Tarantino paid off well and it's a film to which I would return with pleasure.",7,0,1,18 March 2007
The Big Blue," a synonym for the ocean
","THE movie that made Besson go down in history. A key-movie that divided the French public between the ones who saw on it, only a tedious documentary about the ocean and the others who acclaimed this passionating movie. As far as I'm concerned, I rank in the second category. 'Le grand bleu', it's simply a periphrase with a tinge of euphemism to design the ocean, a universe that always inspired to men fear but also fascination. The two main characters, Jacques Maillol and Enzo Molinari are fascinated by the sea but for different reasons. If Reno devotes all his energies to diving so as to access to success and glory, the sea is more than this for Jacques. He was born with it, he swears by it (so much that he neglects Johanna's love) and the sea will lead him to death. A place of athletic competition, an ideal place for rest and entertaining where dolphins are his real and sole friends, finally the eternal heaven, the ocean epitomizes all this to Jacques. 'le grand bleu' also ranks among the movies that you must watch rather than telling it. Of course, there isn't almost any plot, dialogs are short and rare but pictures are gorgeous enough to create an entrancing climate supported by Eric Serra's mesmerizing music. The movie's technical qualities can only arouse admiration: a shiny photography that perfectly reflects the color of the sea, the blue and a fluid making sometimes clever: Jacques' childhood is made in black and white. Besides, the movie enabled to discover two outstanding actors: Jean-Marc Barr and Jean Reno but oddly if Reno became one of the most popular French actors, it wasn't the case with Barr. In spite of a promising debut, he has never be able to make a movie that could have got back him in the saddle. Maybe was he so elated at the bottom of the sea, in heaven where everything is fine...",Null,49,70,2 March 2003
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," between heaven and hell
","I haven't watched the first version supposedly mixed of 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' (1971) dismissed by Roald Dahl and so I will eschew any comparison with this long-anticipated cover directed by Tim Burton. I watched it a few days ago and the first thing that comes to mind about it is that Tim Burton's version is a wonderful example of how the adaptation of a book for children for the silver screen can be transcended into a stylish, prime rendering. Anyway, when I heard that the filmmaker of gems like 'Edward Scissorhands' (1990), 'Ed Wood' (1994) or 'Sleepy Hollow' (1999) planned to give a fresh cinematic rendering of Roald Dahl's work, I thought it was highly likely to be a triumph by any standards. The novel alchemy of these two authors worked wonders to deliver a 'Burtonian' film to the core. From film to film, the filmmaker pursues his exploration of the strange with these offbeat characters who are generally outcast and the inclusion of the whimsical in the everyday life.To make the 5 little lucky children visit the coveted dream factory, Tim Burton's imagination is in full swing. It's visually a feast for the eyes with a succession of quirky, fanciful moments fraught with oddball ideas and bathing in an ocean of colors. It is pure rapture that is prevailing in the viewer's mind who is sliding in pure wonder before so many used visual, thoughtful effects and devices to deliver a solid portion of dream and escape.'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' also ensures continuity with Tim Burton's precedent works because analogies can be found with several of his previous films. A town with many houses and shops gathered and at the edge of the city, a somewhat isolated, mysterious place where lives a bizarre outcast who generates fascination among the inhabitants. Doesn't it remind you of 'Edward Scissorhands'? Moreover, the machinery system could be an echo of Edward's inventor's. Then, if the town has realist British accents in its architecture, Charlie's house seems to be built in a Gothic one and Tim Burton's taste for Gothic trend stands out once again after having come to the forefront in 'Batman' (1989) or 'Sleepy Hollow'. The interior of the house includes amusing details: Charlie's grandparents spend most of their days in a big bed. At last, the end of the film is similar to 'Big Fish' (2003) insofar as it showcases the lack of communication between Wille Wonka and his father and their reconciliation.To come back to the story, the audience is caught in a jaunty walk behind the walls of the chocolate factory just like the visitors and however, this state of bliss seems to be short-lived. This place has something ominous like a big haunted house from which one couldn't escape with its long corridors and spacious rooms. Something the viewer feels when the visitors are at the threshold of the firm with the mechanical dolls singing and dancing before finally being burnt. This fanciful, almost fictional world conceal doubtful, unnerving parts, beginning with Willy Wonka himself. Under his wry, laid-back appearance, this character has an eerie part of ambiguity. He is cut off from the exterior world and barely worries about the unfortunate fate of the 4 smug young imps and one can fuel doubts about their mishaps: were they premeditated? Finally, Willy Wonka has to come to terms with the demons of his past to be in peace with himself and to be a human being.Of course, as a whole, one could object that the form tends to be favored over the contents with a rather linear master plan especially with the installments concerning the four pretentious brats who are punished of their own sins but Tim Burton keeps his distance from the moralizing, stereotyped aspects of the storytelling. 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' is also a tale that shelters emotion and tenderness mainly brought on by Charlie's grandfather.The cast is equal to the sum of the story and its treatment. Johnny Depp who had already acted in a so-so movie dealing with chocolate, 'Chocolat' (2000) by Lasse Hallstrom can be once again grateful to Tim Burton to have conceived him a tailor-made role for him in which he's constantly fit in.All you have to do is to sit down and savor a well-rounded delicacy from a connoisseur in storytelling who added one more canonical contribution to a monument (a figurative sense for his filmography) that cuts a fine figure. Go on like that Mr. Burton! Would Roald Dahl have appreciated this bracing result?",9,5,9,3 December 2006
Mission: Impossible II," really impossible?
","Launched 4 years after the first movie of the same title, 'Mission Impossible 2' is very superior to its predecessor. Maybe, it was a mistake to have hired Brian de Palma to the making. Indeed, the movie, in spite of good sequences was hard to maintain the spectator's attention due to a complicated screenplay.Here, John Woo took over and he has done quite well. The complicated screenplay disappeared in favour of a more simple and traditional plot. But its characteristics gives an impression of 'déjà-vu'. From this impression, John Woo and his scriptwriters used subjects threadbare: to save the world from a threatening danger (here, it happens to be a virus called 'the Chimère'), to use an ancient mistress of the wicked's boss so as to get information. At last, the unavoidable duel between Tom Cruise and his enemy at the end of the movie.Fortunately, the banality of the screenplay is compensated by a spectacular and meticulous making, especially the brisk chases. At least, it proves a thing, Woo is the specialist of action movies and knows perfectly his job. Obviously, it doesn't go without a few implausibilities. 'Mission Impossible 2' is a more entertaining movie than the first and where Tom Cruise doesn't play too much the Dom Juan. He's even well directed.",Null,1,3,20 March 2003
Black Hawk Down," Ridley Scott + Jerry Bruckheimer: a so-so war movie
","The third movie made by Ridley Scott in less than two years after 'Gladiator' (2000) and 'Hannibal' (2001), 'Black Hawk Down' is a movie too much for him just like it's a movie too much in the genre of the war movie. Yes, I know it enjoys a very good mark on this site (7.6 out of 10) but I don't think it is fully justified and by writing a very mixed review about this movie, I will surely provoke an angry response from its admirers.I think I know why the director was interested by the presented topic which is besides a true story: the critical situation of an American army who after a failed military operation finds herself besieged in a town full of Somalians armed to the teeth. Scott attempted to make this tragic episode authentic and for this he doesn't pull his punches. It's true that visually and technically his making is breath-taking. The dramatic evolution of the conflict, the shooting and fight sequences are carefully shot with style. The thread of the story is perceived by several bunches of soldiers but we are never out of one's depth. Moreover, the film-maker depicts with a very straightforward and gritty way à la 'Saving Private Ryan' (1998), atrocities of war. The film includes quite a lot of shots with bloody faces or ripped bodies which are difficult to forget.'Saving Private Ryan' showed similar horrors during its first half an hour. 'Black Hawk Down' stretches them during about an hour and a half (only the beginning is devoted to the introduction of the most important characters and to the careful preparations of the operation) and this is where things go wrong. Scott wants to impress and insist on the tragic nature of the war. But by constantly climbing in violence and opting for (very) realism, 'Black Hawk Down' gradually becomes monotonous to watch. Sometimes, one can feel that the machine turns without gripping and the whole is lackluster. Ultimately, you are never really touched by the hardness of the fights and the soldiers' distress causes more indifference than sympathy.If Scott's making is awesome (in spite of the reserves we can have about it), one can't say the same thing for a repetitive screenplay which tends to fray throughout the movie. It tries hard not to keep turning over the eternal clichés about war (and for once, they aren't too overwhelming). But it is overall weak for other reasons. For example, the dramatic extent of the conflict is always perceived from the Americans' point of view. In front of them, the Somalians always seem to be distant. We virtually don't know what they think or feel. They just keep on fighting against their adversaries. In another extent, some characteristics of the script testify the producer Jerry Bruckheimer's signature like dominating patriotic feelings but also a salutary image from the USA eager to put an end to Aidid's dictatorship in Somalia and for this don't think twice before directly intervening in the country.There aren't big surprises at the level of the cast. It's just an adequate and tailor-made casting with actors accustomed to act in action or war movies like Tom Sizemore or William Fichtner. For them, it's business as usual and they act military characters like the ones we can imagine. However, one can't say that there's a sole main character but several which brings a little of credibility and neutrality in the story.Overrall, if we could compare 'Black Hawk Down' to a present, this is how it could be presented: the wrapping is alluring but what the box contains is hollow. We just retain Scott's spectacular making and the bloody effects. And for Bruckheimer, it's just potboiler for him.",5,5,16,12 March 2005
Big Fish," how to embellish and tell a fulfilled life through the prism of the imaginary...
","In his life, Will Bloom has grown up with his father's extravagant stories with which he could never separate the parts of reality and imaginary. One more zany story featuring a big fish led him to a feud with him and a break up which lasted three years. He comes back at his bedside for his father is sorely ill. For their last intimate moments, Will wants to know better his father's real identity behind these stories with multiple colorful characters evolving in a crop of various scenery.Before 'Big Fish', Tim Burton had signed two faultless films featuring a main character called Edward: 'Edward Scissorhands' (1990) and 'Ed Wood' (1994). These offbeat characters remodeled life their own way and gave it a vision steeped in naivety and optimism. By pruning trees and hedges to amount to geometrical and human forms, the former gave a new face to the little town in which he lived, let's admit it not for very long. With an unshakable enthusiasm, Ed Wood put all his naive ideas in two-bit but charming films. Edward Bloom is the worthy heir of these two protagonists. Thanks to his art of storytelling and the power of his imagination, his wondrous stories make the audience travel and make it believe in a better future too. The film reminded me a little of 'Forrest Gump' (1994) because these two works showcase two naive main characters who have little chance to get a fulfilled life and however they achieved this feat. The major difference lies in the fact that in 'Big Fish' Burton never prattles stupidly. Anyway, here his own style reaches its climax. An unlikely mix of strange, eccentric and fantastic with the meetings of mundane characters and monsters. The filmmaker keeps tenderness for them either it is the big nice giant or this apparently arrogant ringmaster acted by Danny De Vito who turns into a werewolf at night. I remember having watched an interview with Tim Burton one day in which he said that monsters or monster-like characters were bad because they were often sad and lonely. Such is the case here and that's why the filmmaker keeps tenderness for them.However, the Burton insiders will have surely noticed that the filmmaker virtually didn't include his usual parts of grim and grisly in this chain of tales or they are subdued at best. This helps to better propagate this sensation of innocence and optimism and also to awake in us our children spirits. Because cinema is basically this: the telling of a story and 'Big Fish' is this and more. It or rather Edward's mind shelters a thousand tales for everyone. Then, in spite of this innocent vibe which suffuses the whole film, it also keeps a certain grave tonality. Before he started to write and shoot his film, Tim Burton lost his father and became a father! That's why, emotion can be felt in the scenes between Edward and his son. And there could also be this question: why does Edward present himself in the company of fanciful people in different landscapes? Why can't he separate the 'embellished' from the reality? Is it because he has a very vivid imagination? Does he want to go beyond the simple representation of an exemplary life? These question will go unanswered and the frontier between the real and the imaginary is very blurred.For his 2003 vintage, Tim Burton gathered a stellar cast. Apart from prime performances from Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor, virtually every other minor actor has palpable presence on the screen. I would grant a mention to Steve Buscemi and I dig the scene in which he attacks the bank.Tim Burton completely transcended what seemed to be on the paper a corny subject on a stylish, whimsical treatment. It's a feast for the eyes and the mind. 'Big Fish' eclipses the uneven 'Planet of the Apes' (2001) because we found back the real Burton. He once confessed that he had never been an expert at storytelling but when he hires Albert Finney to produce a thousand of them, he unveils some of his unsuspected gifts.",8,0,0,23 September 2006
2001: A Space Odyssey," Absolute masterpiece
","On a scale from 1 to 10,a ten would not be enough for such a masterwork. 1968 was the definitive landmark for sci-fi movies.So innovative was the screenplay,so devastating were the pictures,so haunting was the score that Kubrik's movie took our breath away,mesmerizing us ,turning us into creatures in rapture,in awe .Some scenes are so admirable,so sublime,that they make you cry:remember the ape discovering the power of a tool,the spaceships floating while exotic 'Blue Danube' is heard. This movie could go on four hours and hours ,no one would notice.One hundred years from now,future scholars will write exegesises of the bewildering finale.As vain and futile as the quest for the Holy Graal.Our connection to the movie is subliminal,the long 'psychedelic' sequence comes as a perfect metaphor.Remember ,in Ingmar Bergman's 'seventh seal',the lines :'questions are more important than the answers'.Kubrick wanted the movie to stir something inside of us,to speak to our subconscious.And AC Clarke ,who co-wrote the screenplay mischievously added;'this is a fiction;reality will be certainly stranger'. No sci-fi movie comes close to 2001:'star wars' does not really appeal to adults the same way ,by a long shot .'Close encounters',while aping some of Kubrik tricks,remains puerile and spoils everything by showing almost everything in its turgid finale.",10,6,24,22 June 2001
There's Something About Mary," Yes, she only causes torments!
","One of the most successful movies launched in 1998 and as far as I'm concerned, I find it hard for me to explain the reason of this enormous success because this movie is devoid of interest. I'd like to speak well of this comedy but I can't succeed in. However, the main idea of the movie was interesting. This is the story of a young man (Ben Stiller who wish to pick up the trail of a girl he loved, Mary (Cameron Diaz) when he was in high school. For this, he hires a detective (Matt Dillon) but it's not easy: not only falls Dillon in love with her but the competition is very hard because Mary's got other admirers, notably a so-called architect (Lee Evans) and even an elderly man!Unfortunately, the Farrelly brothers obviously felt like introducing a crude and even disgusting humor which is everything except funny. When you think about 'Toto le héros' a fantastic movie made by Jaco Van Dormael who succeeded in introducing a quiet and ironic humor even in dramatic sequences, you can't help feeling dismay towards 'there's something about Mary'.  Not only, its humor lacks of sharpness and subtlety but it's also completely irrelevant and it doesn't lend itself to certain sequences in the movie. This major flaw spoils it and it's a pity because it enjoys a good performance, especially Matt Dillon and Lee Evans. At last, a predictable and convenient happy-end comes to crown it all.For me, 'there's something about Mary' is a movie to forget",4,1,5,3 June 2003
The Last Samurai," the adventures of Tom Cruise in Japan
","1876. A hero of the American Civil War, the general Nathan Algren (played by the famous star whom it is useless to introduce) has however a strong bias for alcohol and is haunted by his murky past. However he is given the chance to start a new life in Japan where he has to command the army of the Japanese emperor who wishes to modernize his country. It is however more his counselor Omura who guides him in his choices and decisions. One day, Algren's army is slaughtered by a platoon of samurais. Algren becomes prisoner of them and is taken to their village. At first mistrustful because he is in a state of captivity, he ends up embracing the samurai way of life and gaining the friendship of the chief Katsumoto, apparently mesmerized by this bearded stranger with long hair with whom he thinks he has a lot to learn. Alas, the emperor (or rather Omura) wants to put an end to this archaic way of life and endeavors of negotiation with Katsumoto come to nothing. The samurai chief decides to attack maybe for the last time the army of the emperor now under Grant's command and as for Algren, he's stuck between a rock and a hard place...Japan exerts a vivacious fascination on American cinema these last years and of course the Hollywood industry couldn't resist it. One year before 'the Last Samurai' opened, Gore Verbinski made a remake of 'the Ring' with satisfying results. Would this fascination serve to conceal a block from the most famous cinematographic firm in the world supposed to convey dream and escape? Here, if one goes on uncharted waters or rather uncharted lands at the level of the backdrop, one can't say the same thing for a story which is academic to a fault and to a film full of tasty tastelessness. I don't want to be malicious towards Edward Zwick but it seems to me that his scenario (even with the help of two partners) is like a catalog of clichés and commonplaces about several points. Just check the persona of Algren and his adventures: alcoholic, a mind eaten by past demons, a chance to redeem himself and to find a new sense to his stranded life by adapting to the samurai way of life which he embraces with pleasure and fascination. Then, after the emperor's denial to negotiate with Katsumoto, he's haunted by the sense of honor and sacrifice. So guess what camp he will choose. I forgot that there was also the obligatory idyllic love affair between him and the Japanese inhabitant which put him up under her roof. The story has unfortunately a stale Hollywood whiff which pervades the whole film and makes it formulaic from the first to the last image. I must say that I began to stay out of the film very quickly.Apart from being compelled to the Hollywood codes and trademarks, the story also partly acts as a pretext to make the audience discover the treasures and secrets of the samurai way of life (Cruise is the intermediary between the two faces of Japan the film presents) but I must say that there's absolutely nothing wrong about it if one has kept his sensitivity and his thirst for knowledge about different peoples with different cultures. Zwick and Cruise manage to make us share their fascination for this ancient culture in which silence, patience and wisdom help to an improvement of one's personality.But some qualities emerge of this linear story and this spate of clichés. The cinematography is clean, splendid. The fighting and war sequences are superbly organized and filmed and momentarily get the film out of its lethargy even if the final combat through its organization smells the reheated but Zwick tried to insert at all costs a happy-end to stop the film to end in a bitter way. Given the weight of this happy-end it's an artificial way to end his film.'The Last Samurai' is also handicapped by weak dialogs and his main star. Tom Cruise is as expressive as a brick wall, except in the sequences when he is supposed to be in anger. Then, he manages to shade his acting. His partners aren't well served because they have to act cardboard characters. Only Ken Watanabe, through the intensity of his looks and the eloquence of his lines is the stand-out of a lackluster cast. He even beats Cruise hands down.So, 'the Last Samurai' will appeal to you if: a) you are interested in Japanese culture b) you are a Tom Cruise devotee c) you are deeply attached to the standards of the Hollywood industry.The others can easily do without it.",5,2,4,3 May 2006
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," an useless sequel to 'home alone'
","When you watch this film for the first time, you can ask yourself this question 'was it useful to make a sequel to one of the most successful films made in 1990?'. The answer is obviously not. The only interest of the film is commercial. Indeed, John Hughes and Chris Colombus felt like renewing with the huge success of 'Home Alone'. Although this film was average, it was quite funny but, here, its sequel is very poor and disappointing. The film takes back too many elements from the first and as a consequence, it doesn't create surprises any more. For example, when Kevin is at the Plaza Hotel, he's watching, apparently, a detective film, and we know that the man, in the film, will kill the young lady as it was the case in Home Alone with the two men on the video. On the other hand, Kevin's weird neighbour was considered a slayer for a long time; but then Kevin found out that he was an unhappy man. In the film, a tall woman who brings up pigeons took the place of Kevin's neighbour and like this man, she's apparently threatening, but then again, like the man, she had a miserable life. So the film is deprived of originality. Moreover, the screenplay is always predictable and sometimes it's unlikely: Kevin's traps are more dangerous than in the previous film and however the two burglars don't seem to suffer a lot. At last Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci aren't very funny, Stern is even ridiculous and dumb. In 1997, a third sequel was made but with a different actor instead of Macaulay Culkin in the main role. Let's hope, there won't be a fourth.",Null,3,6,23 June 2002
The Fly," A good remake
","From George Lagelaan's short story, David Cronenberg jettisonned all the characters,except the hero who is younger and a bachelor.Gone is the family,gone is the sheet on the monster's head,we had in the faithful Neumann version(1956).He only kept the 'incident':the fly in the machine.Thanks to Jeff Goldblum's strange face,his remake is convincing ,focusing on the psychological aspect.The mutation is impressive,but does not sacrifice the emotion to special effects. This might possibly be an AIDS metaphor:the hero feels guilt (and however,he 's done nothing wrong to deserve such a fate;absolutely nobody deserves AIDS),his girlfriend is helpless ,their love affair is now irremediably doomed.Here the two versions meet again for the final. Both versions had sequels:the first one had two which I have not seen,the Cronenberg had one:so-so.",8,3,6,10 August 2001
Groundhog Day," An endless day where everyday is like Sunday
","Phil Connors, a cynical and unbearable journalist goes like every year in a small town in Pennsylvania to report on 'Groundhog Day', it means the beginning of the spring. But, he is out of luck because due to the bad weather, he and his crew (including the pretty Rita) he is compelled to stay at his work place for the night. The following day, he awakes and lives exactly the same day again but he is the only one to realize it. It is like this, the next days again and again! What should Phil do to stop this? Maybe an improvement of his personality would be the wisest solution.You can easily imagine what a filmmaker like Frank Capra would have done with such a topic but Harold Ramis managed very well and he signs here his most beautiful success to date and one of the finest comedies of the nineties. The main strength of 'Groundhog Day' comes from a strong and inventive screenplay which enables Bill Murray to go through all the different states which is logical because if tomorrow is the same day, anything goes for him! The script also draws its comical force from the repetition. This process gives delightful sequences, notably in the first part of the movie. You have to see Murray live the same day again, faced with the same situations and as he despises people, it can only make the spectator laugh. Moreover, Ramis described his main character by mocking at him a little.Of course, the evolution followed by Murray is a little predictable (scornful at the beginning, he will succeed in becoming nice at the end of the film and in finding love with Rita) and you easily guess the message that Ramis tries to put across. But it remains nevertheless warm and deeply humane. However that may be, the director gave us a pleasant, sometimes funny sometimes moving movie to watch. And it is one of Bill Murray's best performances: fair, never bombastic. What more could you ask from him?",Null,72,130,12 August 2004

Total Recall," thrilling, bloody, complicated what more can I say?
","SPOILERS, SPOILERS, SPOILERSIf I had to rank the ten best science-fiction movies made in the nineties, Total Recall would appear. Not only, is it one of the best science-fiction movies of the last decade but it's also one of the most original movies ever made. The film-maker, Paul Verhoeven made a masterstroke. His movie is a studied mix of science-fiction, horror, and detective film. It's of course based on a rich but complicated screenplay. Indeed, during the movie it's nearly impossible to distinguish dream from reality and to define Schwarzenegger's state of mind. The screenplay is also skilled because it aims at getting the spectator lost by leading him towards wrong tracks. Moreover, Verhoeven made of Mars, a dangerous and dreadful planet where you have to mistrust everyone and where everything can happen, especially the unexpected.Arnold Schwarzenegger plays with conviction his role of a worker in search of his real identity. Little by little, we're quite sure that he puts himself in the place of an hero who must release Mars in the grip of the dictator Cohaagen.The movie is also worth seeing for its outstanding special effects and its fantastic sceneries. It's also a well-regulated movie between the  (bloody) action sequences and moments that encourage reflection.At last, Verhoeven showed feats because he succeeds in sustaining the interest of the spectator during all the movie in spite of its difficult story. Besides, you follow the movie with a great interest hoping that Verhoeven will give us a rational explanation about Scwarzenegger's state of mind. But it's not really the case. In spite of an 'happy end', the film-maker is careful not to reveal the truth. So, doubt about dream or reality remains.At the end, this is indisputably Verhoeven's best movie and Schwarzenegger's best performance to date",Null,4,10,23 May 2003
Some Like It Hot," Some like the fanfares d'amour hot.
","In the thirties ,Billy Wilder used to work in France ,where he made his first film 'mauvaise graine',with Danielle Darrieux in 1934.The following year ,Richard Pottier made his 'fanfare d'amour'.So Wilder probably heard about it.Here's a short summary of 'fanfare d'amour': Two comedians in dire straits,Jean and Pierre are chasing after any sort of work.This year,female combos are trendy.So they dress up as women and become part of 'Dutch tulips' and all-women orchestra.Everybody take the night train .Jean and Pierre fall in love with Gaby and become rivals.But the girl has met Jean (in a man's clothes!) and she's crazy about him.Besides the theater director (a man!) falls also in love with Jean whom he mistakes for a woman!There's no coincidence;there are too many similarities between the 1935 'fanfare d'amour' and 1959 'some like it hot' .The former is impossible to see even in France where the telly never broadcasts it.Anyway,Wilder wins hands down:Richard Pottier was a moderately talented director,the American director a genius.Almost fifty years later,'some like it hot' remains my all-time favorite comedy.And as this not avowed remake does not need a third one,because I could hardly imagine someone doing a better work than Wilder.Nobody's perfect ,but at his best he was.NB:actually,Wilder's inspiration was the German remake.",10,5,9,21 August 2003
Titanic," my heart will go on...
","One of the monuments of the cinema which won 11 Oscars in Hollywood in 1998, a huge success (well deserved) all over the world. The revelation of two actors until then virtually unknown. This is James Cameron' masterpiece. He chose to relate the tragedy of the Titanic that took place on the 12th of April 1912, through the intermediary of a love story lived between a wealthy and pretty young woman (Kate Winslet) and a modest painter (Léonardo Dicaprio). Cameron succeeds in making it fascinating in the first part of the movie. The love between 'Jack' and 'Rose' is so strong that can hardly believe the Titanic will bump into an iceberg and will sink. It's also together with a model bravery that the two lovers will try to escape the ship's sinking (although historically accurate).Léonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet will stay among the famous mythical couples in the cinema's history. It's obvious that they are between the hands of a conscientious and carefully organized film-maker. James Cameron doesn't leave anything high and dry. He adopted a sustained rhythm not spoiled by the enormous means that he's got. It's useless to say that he masters them perfectly thanks to an important budget. Not only has this budget enabled a meticulous reconstruction of the ship but it has also enabled a reconstruction from the traditional life in 1912 with its contrasts, its oppositions. Moreover, the movie enjoys an outstanding performance from all the actors, even the minor ones and several sequences and dialogs don't lack humor.But 'Titanic' is also a limited place where takes place the confrontation of two different worlds: the proletarians and the middle-class persons. This confrontation is particularly well described during the ship's sinking: the rich are by the lifeboats whereas the poor are still inside the ship and they're forbidden to go outside.The second part of the movie is remarkably well filmed and follows a logical advance based on the increase of fear and distress. Cameron emphasizes particularly on the madness that spread to the passengers but also on the officers. Little by little, these last ones are becoming mad (one of them will kill unwittingly one of the passengers who was trying to get into a lifeboat). Besides, a few touches make the movie surrealist (the four musicians keep on playing while the ship's sinking)The other obvious qualities: a gorgeous music, some smart costumes. At the end, a movie that creates a deep emotion and where everything contributes to a perfect success.",10,12,21,29 March 2003
The Happening," Too much grass

The Untouchables," the untouchables revised and given a new treatment by Brian De Palma
","'The Untouchables' is reckoned as one of the kingpins in Brian De Palma's filmography by the insiders and his devotees. I would tend to agree with them and to be conducive about this general contention with however certain reservations.This transposition of the well-known TV series is surely one of his less personal works. His obsessions with Sir Alfred Hitchcock take a back seat and we're quite far from the thriller genre with grisly, bloody effects which helped to build the filmmaker's reputation. Actually, 'the Untouchables' appears as formulaic in the presentation of events: Chicago during Prohibition under the control of the underworld with its main leader Al Capone, here acted by Robert De Niro whose performance is however less startling than in 'Angel Heart' (1987) by Alan Parker, released the same year. A young fresh FBI agent Elliott Ness (Kevin Costner) rises up against him and has a yearning to make him fall. After a failed police raid in Capone's warehouses, he teams up with a seasoned cop, Malone (Sean Connery) and hires a band of volunteers who share his same determinations and then their hopes soar. But some members are killed including Malone. This doesn't help Ness's men to arrest Capone's accountant and his financial registers...It's sure that De Palma wanted to remain as close as possible to the historic reality. It seems that everything in the film from the scenery to the making was recreated to capture the stifling atmosphere of the Prohibition and the spirit of the film noir in the thirties but the contents of the film is very classic as a whole. And it's often aggravated by a streak to excessive effects, one of De Palma's main drawbacks. Visual excesses which are mostly present in shoot-out and fight sequences like Malone's slow death. Ditto at another level for Ennio Morricone's majestic but overwhelming music. But once again and like in some De Palma's works, the rumbustious form compensates the contents despite bombastic tendencies. Three seminal sequences would deserve to be legion in the filmmaker's canon: the western sequence with the Canadian mounted police, Malone's death, the arrest of the accountant by Ness in a shoot-out sequence doubled with a wink to Eisenstein's masterpiece 'the Battleship Potemkine' (1926).It's rather acceptable stuff but I favor Phil Karlson's terse style on the same domain with 'the Scarface Mob' (1959).",7,2,7,11 November 2006
Mystic River," to rank among the 5 best movies made in 2003
","Let's say it straight away: before 'Mystic River' (2003), Clint Eastwood's last works had left me a little unsatisfied; particularly 'Blood Work' (2002), a watchable thriller with a certain charm but without great originality. But the following year, with 'Mystic River', he made a sensational comeback and quite obviously this movie, which critically and commercially gave a boost to his career is his most accomplished since 'Unforgiven' (1992).By watching 'Mystic River' one can feel that Clint Eastwood, more than ever put a lot of effort into the elaboration of his movie. From a subtle screenplay written by Brian Helgeland who shows that he is a far better scriptwriter than director (as far as I'm concerned, I hated the rather insipid 'A Knight's Tale' 2001), Eastwood develops an absorbing and ingenious directing which contributes in weaving a shady and even stifling by moments atmosphere. On another extent, Eastwood takes back a way that had worked for him in 'Blood Work': favoring calm and patience. And indeed, on an unhurried pace, the film-maker takes all his time to shot the evolution of this detective story. More important, he made this choice for another reason: to do a thorough psychological study of the three main characters. The basis of 'Mystic River' consists in a classic detective investigation (nevertheless passionating in its construction) doubled with a relevant description of the three main protagonists.To watch 'Mystic River' is like to find oneself on the edge of a forest and to disappear into it. The more the movie progresses, the more we discover three heart-broken characters because they are linked by dark events. First, Jimmy Markum (Sean Penn). We learn that he has flirted with violence and has spent a few years in jail but he seems to have become a well-behaved man: he works in a grocery store and regularly goes to church. But the death of his daughter crushed him and he is determined to avenge her. Then, Sean Divine (Kevin Bacon) who appears as a reliable and lucid cop but whose private life is hell: he experienced a failed marriage and his wife keeps on harassing him day and night. At last, Dave Boyle (Tim Robbins), a broken father who underwent a deep traumatic experience (he was kidnapped and raped by two men who claimed to be priests). The consequences are terrible: he can't communicate anymore, he can't defend himself anymore and he wanders like a ghostly figure in the streets of his neighborhood. As a matter of fact, this traumatic scene is at the root of the three characters' misfortunes. Being the very first sequence of the movie, it sets the tone of Clint Eastwood's 24th movie. It presents Jimmy, Sean and Dave playing in a street. The sky is gray, the houses of the neighborhood are bare and austere. The ball which disappears through the manhole may symbolize the loss of childhood. Then, a big black car arrives. One of the men gets out and claims to be a priest (or does he?). He orders Dave to go into the car and the latter drives away. This moment will haunt the three boys for the rest of the lives and will deeply influence their personality. Roughly, 'Mystic River' demonstrates in a conclusive way how such a past dramatic event can influence our present lives.In virtually all the critics I have read, 'Mystic River' was hailed for its cast. It's true that Penn, Bacon and Robbins rank among the best American actors of their generation and I think we will never thank Eastwood enough for having reunited them. By giving a lot of depth to their respective characters, one can feel that they were giving their all, which can explain why the movie was shot in a rather short time (39 days). They may even never battle their dazzling performances. And the rest of the cast is just as equal as the whole, especially the actresses whose female characters have an important role in the story since they influence (unconsciously or not) their husbands' actions and characters.To a third degree, Eastwood's major work is also used to denounce the deceptive superficiality of the appearances, the omnipresence of violence and the credulity of many inhabitants. The film opens with an overview of the neighborhood but doesn't show yet that it is devastated by violence. No matter what the time is. Violence is omnipresence and the fact that it touches younger generations proves that it isn't ready to subside.At last, let's also congratulate Eastwood for the remarkable music he has signed himself with his son. With this music, simplicity rhymes with efficiency. One has just to listen to a few notes to feel an intense emotion inside us.In the middle of all these qualities, there are just minor faults. So, Bacon is a tormented cop due to his disastrous marriage and however, we really don't know what went wrong with his wife. Is it Dave's kidnapping? Is it his trying job? This point remains ambiguous. Ambiguous is also the adjective that suits the best to qualify the end of the film. What can mean the gesture Bacon makes to Penn? But these two points let freely the way to any possible interpretation.The contribution of the crew in Eastwood's work is total and so is my enthusiasm for 'Mystic River'. If you haven't seen it yet, go and watch it. You won't regret it. At the age of 73 years old, 'grandad' Clint Eastwood is still in great form and given the recent triumph of 'Million Dollar Baby' (2004), he seems to have decided to bring the house down again in the landscape of American cinema for our greatest pleasure.",10,76,144,23 April 2005

","Frank Capra's peak,this movie influenced a lot of directors and ,unlike some of his other works such as 'you can't take it with you' ,it is as fresh today as it was 60 years ago.Capra's detractors criticize his eternal optimism but even that is questionable:What would have become of the town,had the hero taken his own life?Was there only one just man ,like in Sodom in Genesis ,to save the city from the impending fall?It brings into question the so-called trust Capra puts in the human race.It's not a rosy world.The scenes between James Stewart and his guardian angel are so powerful you cannot hold back your tears.No other artist told us that ALL human beings were important in such a wonderful way.And nobody depicted the yuletide spirit like Capra.",10,1,5,9 August 2006

Psycho," Calling it a masterpiece is an euphemism.
","One of the few gems that would deserve more than the simple 10!It's the finest thriller of all times,but it's not only a thriller:it's everything:a psychological drama,a -monstrous- love film,a road movie-in its first part-,a psychopathology study,an update of those novels of the nineteenth century in which you take your life in your hands when you enter an isolated inn.All this and so much more.Indeed so horrendous were the chances taken by Hitchcock on this movie that,with any lesser skill,the result could have been disastrous;think of it: the heroine disappears halfway through the movie ,leaving the spectator an orphan,or Tom Thumb in the threatening forest;one third of the movie features no dialogue at all;it was a shoestring budget because nobody but the Master and his close collaborators like Herrmann believed in such a project.Bernard Herrmann outdoes himself for the absolutely perfect soundtrack.His work is so haunting,so mesmerizing that it was imitated to death,when it was not simply used as it was in countless plagiarisms.(DePalma's 'Dressed to kill' is a good example)Pushing his innovations forwards,the Master,after having used in 'the rope',only 11 shots for the whole movie,reverses his strategy:70 in the 45 seconds shower scene.Nothing of the plot should be revealed.Everything you would say would be a spoiler.I'm sure that I've already said too much of it.Just enjoy.",10,3,9,27 August 2001
Rosemary's Baby," Rosemary in Chinatown.
","Roman Polanski used to be great then;and it seems that his latest movie is a return to outstanding form.'Rosemary's baby' is a movie I've been watching for years,always finding something new.I'll never grow tired of it,it's definitely my all-time terror favorite movie (with Robert Wise's 'the haunting' (1963))There are strong connections between 'Rosemary's baby' and Polanski's film noir 'Chinatown':in these two masterworks,there are two worlds which coexist and there are tenuous links between them:in 'Rosemary' the mysterious cupboard ,the Chinese area in the 1974 work.Pregnancy and search for water (in 'Chinatown' ) show strange analogies too.And two monstrous unions in both movies :the incestuous affair in 'Chinatown' echoes to the satanic coupling in Levin's story.Although adapted from Levin's novel,'Rosemary's baby' did not come out of the blue.In his first work,Polanski already showed his irrational world ,his claustrophobia in his 'knife in the water' ,soon followed by 'repulsion' which heralded what was perfectly fulfilled by 'Rosemary'.Those obsessions emerged again in POlanski's best works such as 'the tenant' (1976) and 'death and the maiden' (1975);and 'the pianist ' seems to walk that fine line ,it thrusts RP into the small circle of the most ambitious directors again.But 'Rosemary's baby' is perfection itself: a screenplay most of horror movies can only dream of,an absolutely faultless cast-even if Ruth Gordon steals the show- the rest of the cast should be praised to the skies-,a haunting soundtrack including Komeda's magnificent lullaby,and a first-class director ,whom a lot of 'horror movie' makers should study in detail.They should study,particularly,the last scene ,the strongest of the fantastic genre;no one has ever been able to mix horror,emotion (yes emotion!) and ambiguity all at once.You're all at once bewildered,scared to death and on the verge of tears.Great great movie!",10,3,7,23 September 2003
All Quiet on the Western Front," No time to love ,all the time in the world to die.
","SPOILER:The conclusions in this movie and that of 'a time to love and a time to die',another Remarque's novel which Douglas Sirk transferred to the screen in 1958,are incredibly similar,very powerful and poignant.In the 1930 film ,Paul tries to catch a butterfly and in the 1956 one,Ernst tries to catch his wife's letter which the current sweeps along.END OF SPOILER'All quiet on the western front' is one of the strongest works against war that has been done.Its predecessor was Abel Gance's '.These two works are,IMHO,much better than the overpraised Jean Renoir's 'la grande illusion' ,but there's no accounting for taste.At least ten sequences of Milestone's movie and probably more are milestones: the brainwashing at school by the hothead teacher displays the responsibility schooling had on young minds just before WW1,and not just in Germany;the contrast with the symmetrical scene when Paul has his furlough is all the more shattering;the postman,who has become a sergeant,and does not recognize his former young friends anymore;the assault course during which he humiliates them (Kubrik did not improve on it with his 'full metal jacket' ,more than half a century later);the young soldier dying on his bed while one of his mates covets his leather boots;the evening with women,the only haven of peace in a world gone mad;the pointless and infuriating discussion of the old -who lead the young to the war- ,claiming to give a piece of advice to Paul who goes back to the front.The list is endless.Suffice to say that 'all quiet on the western front' is a great novel (which was burnt ,as all Remarque's works were ,by the Nazis during the auto-da-fés) and its adaptation for the screen was a complete success.Made at the beginning of the talkies era,it never shows its age.",Null,2,4,11 November 2004
Man on Fire," too much fire kills it
","In 1987, Quinnell's book was adapted for the silver screen by Elie Chouraqui, a minor director, responsible of 'Paroles et Musique' (1984) and 'les Marmottes' (1993). This version was not a masterpiece and is now virtually in limbo. Unfortunately, it's not this overlong remake by Tony Scott which will set the record straight.Leaving Italy for Mexico, 'Man on Fire' is split in two drastically different but globally weak halves. The first one deals with Creasy (Denzel Washington) who is hired as a bodyguard in a well-off Mexican family to protect a little girl named Pita (Dakota Fanning). He's a man with a sad past and a strong bias for alcohol. Maybe will he find solace and redemption thanks to the Holy Bible. Ouch! How original. Actually, this first part piles up the clichés linked to Crasy but also to the unlikely friendship he stroked up with his little protégée. First, sullen and distant and then friendly, he has found a way to approach her by developing in her assertion and setting new targets for herself thanks to a swimming competition. But the evolution of his demeanor and especially his liking towards the little girl is showed in a quite shallow way to be really conclusive.Now, what about this second part? It completely changes the tone of the film which takes a leap into explosive violence and linear investigation. After his coma, Creasy turns into a real killing machine who exterminates all the ones who were involved in the abduction of Pita. Blood abundantly flows, explosions succeed themselves with stunts and knock-out images galore. Scott and his scenarist Brian Helgeland also felt compelled to include sequences which shelter free violence. One of them was influenced by Quentin Tarantino's 'Reservoir Dogs' (1992). It's the sequence in which Washinton is with one of the kidnappers in a car and tortures him to make him speak with loud music on the radio. But in parallel not to stay confined in this assumed perspective, Helgeland tried to introduce twists to boost the interest of the viewer in Creasy's vengeful adventure. Thus, in the middle of this second part, we learn a far-fetched revelation whose nature makes a little think of 'Fargo' (1996) by the Coen brothers.The content of the film is made of thin substance and is still plagued by the flashy form. Scott didn't jettison his trademark which mar his efforts. His visual, sound excesses that are supposed to impress and gain the audience's approval make the film distressing to watch in the long run. Hyper images, sophisticated camera work, sharp editing are supposed to be here to compensate the weak potential of the story and it only helps to plague it. Worse: these features sometimes arrive at the most awkward moment in the story and action. Then, the soundtrack is extremely loud and mixed forward. Sometimes, you have to listen very closely to decipher what the characters say. This drawback is more irritating in the second half. 'Man on Fire' is also ruined by an ugly cinematography. What's the consequence of all this? A large proportion of shots are distorted by one or the other of these drawbacks.Overrall the other directions that the scenario could have taken to enable the film to take a subtle, rich dimension have been shelved or lightly touched. For instance, the major problem of these abductions of children in Latin America falls in the second category. Instead, Helgeland created a linear, stubborn revenge story which Scott filmed with a festival of shock images and by this ruined the reduced potential of the story.Even the direction of actors seems absent. Denzel Washington who is a commendable actor is here unable to shade his acting. Christopher Walken, a big American actor isn't given a chance to shine and his part is blatantly underwritten. But the little Dakota Fanning which Sean Penn's fans discovered in 'I Am Sam' (2001) gives a quite mature offering.On its release, 'Man on Fire' was made alluring through an eye-catching cover but this blazing film left me cold. As a scenarist, Brian Helgeland saw brighter days before: 'L.A. Confidential' (1997), 'grandad' Clint Eastwood's 'Mystic River' (2003)...",3,8,20,22 August 2006
Downfall," why so much fuss about this film?
","Hitler's last days in his underground bunker in Berlin in April 1945 and the fall of the Nazi Reich related from several standpoints including his secretary's. The Allies come on in leaps and bounds and are within an ace of the total victory but Hitler (astounding Bruno Ganz) is prisoner of his megalomaniac illusions and his absurd dreams of greatness. A strong division reigns in this underground world between the officers who know the nearly inevitable and adamant end and the ones who are still in prey to an unshakable fanaticism for their guru. Ultimately, endeavors of peace negotiations with the Allies will be begun by the most lucid officers while the most die-hard ones about the Nazi ideology will only see suicide as their last exit...This film shot by Oliver Hirschbegel deserves credit for having looked into a prickly era of history: the end of the Nazi regime led by a dictator who plunged the world into an unparalleled Barbary and violence and responsible of the most horrible human crimes. Derived from two books relating Hitler's last days in his bunker, it was supposed to be an accurate rendering of the facts for the sake of the detail and the historic reality. But inevitably, there are some liberties taken and certain sequences are pure fiction. For example, according to the historian Jean Tulard, Goebbels didn't fire at his wife before killing himself. They poisoned themselves.I also know very well that when the film reached the streets about two years ago, it gave rise to controversy and caused a lot of ink to flow. The mainspring: a more human face of the monster Hitler. But I think there is no real justification for this scandal in its major part. I didn't find that the depiction of Hitler in this 'Untergang' introduced a more enticing face except maybe in some intimate sequences with some women. On the contrary, the Hitler represented in this 'Untergang' is a mercurial, formidable monster who wildly oscillates between rare moments of short lucidity and tantrums, especially when his officers come to announce him that the Allies gain ground and the German army has to draw back. It was a good idea from the director to have often favored the off-camera during these incommoding moments. The camera goes in a next room, generally full of people and one can still hear the dictator's screams. By stubbornly striving to repel the Allies armies with restrained military means, he's like he's beating a dead horse. He also only displays contempt for the German people and holds inhuman facts about the Jewish people. He's a man who firmly believes(or does he?) that the Nazi Reich can go on. One of the most conspicuous sequences show him in front of a model of the architectural Berlin he wants to build in the future. In short, 'der Untergang' introduced Hitler as I had imagined him, nearly exempted of a human face.What remains is an absorbing assessment of a decaying world between the officers who know the impending end of the Nazi reign and have to endure Hitler's absurd intentions and his most staunch devotees which include quite a lot of women who keep on pandering to him. And many of them are ready to commit suicide not to see the end of the Nazi Reich like Goebbels, a narrow-minded man and his wife who is ready to poison her own children. There's a grisly scene which packs a real wallop. But chaos also reigns in this bunker. Some of the members absconded while others party to vainly forget the end. Dancing on a volcano indeed. But disorder also reigns in the devastated streets of Berlin. In the meantime, the apocalyptic shots of Berlin reminded me of Warsaw's in Roman Polanski's admirable 'the Pianist' (2002). See the scene when a more than middle-aged man strives to make a bunch of teenagers realize that by trying to repel a platoon of Sovietic soldiers, they won't be able to hold on very long. But there's a young boy who will manage to repel two tanks ans will be rewarded by the 'Führer'. Then, the Bunker has a lot of dour corridors. They could be the symbols of the confused spirit of the Nazi members and the fact that all these people belong to an underground bunker could be interpreted as a faded microcosm of a regime condemned to disappear.Bruno Ganz's composition is mind-boggling. It seems that it was a tailor-made part for him. He seems to have studied in detail Hitler's persona and he delivered an Oscar-caliber performance which could be worth alone the price of admission. But the film is also buoyed by a topnotch cast in general. Each actor makes his part count. The persona of each protagonist fits them like a glove.I must confess that I was very taken with this film and if one leaves aside the liberties taken in comparison with the historic reality, 'der Untergang' is a gripping film. Its very high stance in the top 250 of this site is certainly too much but it's worth a watch all the same. When the film is over one can only hope this: that such a megalomaniac and dangerous man can never come to power again.",8,4,13,12 April 2006

Scream," Wes Craven's magnum opus
","With 'Scream', Wes Craven who before this had left a chain of horror flicks gave to the horror genre one of its proudest kingpins and a valuable reference which gave a new lease of life to the slasher genre which thrived in the eighties. But also a film which involuntarily became an accursed one since it prompted many fragile teenagers to kill their families or friends dressed in the killer's outfit.Wes Craven exploits the indispensable ingredients pertaining to the serial killer story like a female teenager all alone in her house who is about to watch a horror flick and receives ominous phone calls or teenagers all gathered in a house watching horror flicks and they're all killed one after the other and the filmmaker follows the rules of the game while poring over them. During 110 minutes, Craven mixes the slasher movie and a studied reflection about the genre and its premises. Hence its indisputable strength. Flicks like the 'Freddy' or 'Friday the 13th' endless saga contributed to the fame of the genre and were based on rules that the viewer knows very well. Craven takes them again for himself to reveal the tricks of the trade and to dynamite the clichés. Thus it gives both a highly terrific and terrifying piece of work in which Craven involves the viewer at all levels. One should note down all the witty lines the film shelters and the black humor of a formidable efficiency which lacked in so called gore masterworks like John Carpenter's 'Halloween' (1978). I dig the 'test' in the first sequence the killer asks to Drew Barrymore about horror flicks. Painstakingly built, full of ideas, nods or allusions to gore films which secured the popularity and the trademark of the slasher genre. Craven's film has also the ability to make us shiver and to be jubilant thanks to what has been said before and also thanks to a taut scenario in which the murders aren't only the worthwhile moments as it's often the case in many mediocre horror films. Craven also doesn't fear to delay sequences as much as he can to stretch terror and treat, notably the first one and all that happens in the big isolated house where the students party while very bad things occur near them.This is a film to cherish and to ponder about provided you have nerves of steel and if you keep in mind that it's just pure cinema. And one of the characters says: 'there has to be one or several sequels to a film of this kind'. It was judicious from Craven to have included this cue for there will be two sequels. But the pernicious charm that wraps 'Scream' will be absent in its two heirs.",9,0,3,13 May 2007
Halloween," the night of the masks
","The escapee of a psychiatric hospital comes back to a small town, Haddonfield where fifteen years ago, he was in prey to a deadly madness. The doctor Loomis (Donald Pleasance) thinks that he will come back to this town to commit grisly murders. His thoughts will be confirmed when Laurie's friends (Jamie Lee Curtis) are murdered and she might also be one of his victims.'Halloween' (1978) which put Jamie Lee Curtis on the map (but she would do better with Charles Crichton's so British 'a Fish called Wanda', 1988) heralded a genre or sub-genre which has been thriving on the North-American continent for nearly thirty years now: the teenage slasher movie. The majority of these films are modeled in the same mold: a group of teenagers wrestling with an invincible, sanguinary serial killer who slashes them one after the other. This genre will be tapped again and again and will give masterworks like Wes Craven's terrifying, terrific 'Scream' (1996) but also turkeys by the dozen: the likes of 'Friday the 13th' (only the very first one is good) and saucy spoofs: the 'Scary Movie' saga.John Carpenter isn't a mastermind of the horror/fantasy film even of the B movie. In general his camera work, some of his technical abilities are plagued by weak screenplays and irritable features pertaining to him. 'Halloween' is his most palatable effort, though. The thrifty scheme according to which he builds a latent tension to make the audience wound up and queasy is perhaps easy, simplistic (long travelings and camera movements to delay the murders) but rather efficient although not mind-boggling. I blamed Carpenter for the limited potential of his scenarios, it's a bit evident in 'Halloween': different steps of the story interlock often in a predictable way and some well-worn tricks aren't very welcome (Laurie's little brother who claims having seen the bogey man (the monster in reality) outside. The latter looks out of the window and... you guessed it). That said, Carpenter's expertise to make fear last makes forget the drawbacks of the scenario.Maybe the ones who will discover the film today will be disappointed. Since Carpenter's break-through film, the crowds have seen so many similar stories to this one. That said, it is better to watch it and skip its lousy sequels.",6,3,7,23 June 2006
The Iron Giant," A treat for the whole family
","What 'le roi et l'oiseau' (Jacques PrÃ©vert and Paul Grimault,1977) did against tyranny,'the iron giant did it against wars.OKay ,the ending of the movie does not promise us the end of all wars on earth as in Ted Hughes ' book ,but the scenarists found excellent equivalents.They did not betray Hughes's spirit whose purpose was first pacifist:what's the use of building huge weapons when a dragon coming from outer space makes them useless?So you will find no monster in the movie:it's pure human evil;it's a human hand which pushes the button that will kill and destroy.The part of Hogarth in the book is relatively minor.Hence the necessity to develop his character and to give him a personality.He's got only his mother (whereas in the book he had a whole family)and he's called Hughes of course.Hogarth is a wonderful little boy and he makes with the giant a team that will appeal to everybody.We also meet the scrap's owner and Kent who was made from start to finish by the scenarist with talent:a true villain,a coward,a deceitful man,all his scenes with Hogarth are great!Elements which happened at the very beginning of the story are deftly used in the film :the reconstruction of the robot for which the seagulls play a prominent part .The pictures are often remarkable ,with nods to old sci-fi movies of the fifties .Hogarth in the hands of the giant recalls the young bird which the robot takes in 'le roi et l'oiseau'.I will tell the children:if you 've seen the movie,read the book!if you've read the book,watch the movie!",8,1,4,5 February 2005
The Silence of the Lambs," the intense humming of evil
","With 'Silence of the Lambs' (1991), Jonathan Demme achieved a masterstroke and his movie became one of the landmark movies made in the nineties. The reward of his efforts were the following ones: 5 Oscars in 1992 including Best Movie and a widely deserved blockbuster.This is a movie that enjoys a performance of a high quality with, of course Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins who dominate the cast. The former is absolutely convincing in her role of ambitious trainee who gradually realizes that if she wants to nab 'Buffalo Bill', she has to face and overcome her fears. All this with 'a little help' from Hopkins who finds in this movie one of his best roles and offers a remarkable and especially unforgettable composition of his character: Hannibal Lecter. Besides, concerning this character, more than fascination, this is nearly liking that we feel for this monster. On another hand, his confrontations with Clarisse are the key-moments of the movie where we can notice a careful work on the light, the scenery and the framing.In 'Silence of the Lambs', Demme plays with the spectator's nerves, avoids as much as possible the bloody sequences and creates suspense the following way: throughout the movie, there's a constant tension that starts with the warnings given to Clarisse before her first meet with Lecter. Then, it becomes more marked with Lecter's escape and it reaches a peak with Clarisse's final dual with 'Buffallo Bill'. The whole is well-orchestrated by Demme thanks to a witty making. At last, even if the end reveals an inevitable happy-end, the very last sequence is here to remind us that one of the two monsters in the movie is still alive and he will keep on getting himself talked about (Hannibal, 2001).A terrific and terrifying thriller. Highly recommended and this is one of the very few movies that will haunt you for a long time after you watched it.",8,1,4,2 April 2004
Vanilla Sky," dream in the wintertime
","On my review about 'Abre Los Ojos' (1997), I regarded 'Vanilla Sky' as a poor and pointless remake. Well, I watched 'Vanilla Sky' a few days ago and I wasn't wrong at all.'Vanilla Sky is a remake that suffers of the comparison with the movie by Alejandro Amenabar. First of all, Cameron Crowe seems to like music very much (at a time, he used to be a journalist for 'Rolling Stone). But why did he overload his film with so much music? 'Vanilla Sky' is a movie spoiled by an overwhelming music. Due to this, the movie looks like a huge clip. It's not that the music is bad but the chosen songs suit badly to a movie with a rather dramatic story. It also often plays a decorative role. It means that it appears in several sequences where it wasn't necessary at all. And the chosen songs are sometimes incompatible with the feeling of a few sequences. For example, when Tom Cruise is in the building of the 'Life Extension' firm and he's yelling: 'I want to wake up!', you hear in the background 'Good Vibrations' by the Beach Boys. Is it really the song you can think about when you're in an anguished situation?On another hand, 'Vanilla Sky' is supposed to be a thriller and however, you don't feel that you deal with a thriller. Unlike Amenabar, Crowe doesn't manage in introducing a lasting suspense and anxiety feeling during the movie. Neither, does he succeed in increasing the spectator's curiosity. The omnipresence of the music has got something to do with it. Moreover, Tom Cruise's 'broken face' after the car crash isn't as repulsive as Noriega's one in 'Abre Los Ojos'.This is also a movie that seriously lacks of rhythm, especially near the end. Besides, the end of the movie turns out to be disappointing because the conclusion of the plot isn't clearly explained.As it was supposed, there's a problem as far as the performance is concerned. 'Abre Los Ojos' was a brilliant movie because Amenabar directed very well his actors and they weren't famous. So it made the story more credible. Here, Tom Cruise is too famous and you aren't used in seeing Cameron Diaz in a bad role. As for Kurt Russell, he's very colorless in the role of the analyst if you compare him to Pedro Miguela Martinez. It's the same thing for Noah Taylor who can't hold a candle to GÃ©rard Barray.A flat remake. At a pinch, can you save beautiful pictures of 'a vanilla sky' and if the movie disappointed you a lot, there's always the soundtrack.",Null,0,6,27 September 2003
Any Given Sunday," Sunday, violent Sunday
","Oliver Stone is keen on American football and always dreamt of devoting it a movie. In 1999, he made his dream come true. 'Any Given Sunday' is a quite successful movie about the concerned sport which is practiced at all in France. It's especially during matches that the movie becomes awesome. Stone used a lively and even violent directing and makes us share what the players of his team feel. On the outside of these stunning moments, the movie loses of its appeal and is less convincing when it aims at denouncing financial shady dealings against Al Pacino's team. Moreover, a few characters are on the edge of caricature like one of the players who wish to manage the whole team.

","Simply,this is the best Bond since Connery 's heyday (1963-66) ,but do not expect the return of the good old days .'Casino Royale' is something different,if I should describe it,it would be a return to Ian Fleming's spirit.Those who know the novels will certainly agree.Daniel Craig makes Bond a cold hard unkind character,just the way he is in Fleming's books .Without Connery's sense of humour,his Bond has something disturbing ,even threatening...but he is also a frail human being, as the last scenes show.For the first time -with the exception of ' On Her Majesty's secret service ' - the ending leaves Bond a broken man.I've never liked the Moore/Brosnan efforts .They had the occasional good song( 'Live and let die') ,good cinematography (' the spy who loved me' by Claude Renoir),but the screenplays butchered Fleming's books -who had asked that after his death - thus after 'THunderball' all the plots should be original ones using his titles and characters.And during Dalton's (the best of the post-Connery Bond until Craig's appearance:it's not a coincidence if both were first stage actors,having played Shakespeare)and Brosnan's era,as they were running out of novels,the writers started to write the titles too...The cast and credits are sensational ,matching the splendor of those of 'Goldfinger' and 'Thunderball' .But the first sequences made me fear that Bond should become a superman once again.But the rest of the film is devoid of gimmicks,gadgets ,keeping the big poker game of the novel as its Pièce de Résistance ,and daring unusual inventive scenes (Bond's heart attack;the scene under the shower with Vesper:no it's not what you are thinking of!;the tears of blood) 'Casino Royale' (I 've never understood the spelling;it's a French expression and should be written 'Casino Royal' )makes veiled references to the places where 'Thunderball' (Nassau) ,'Goldfinger '(Switzerland) and above all 'From Russia with Love (the finale in Venice) were partly filmed.Some of the viewers may remember the version of the sixties: an attempt at a spoof on the saga,it failed totally to convince me and the one thing I remember is Herb Alpert's music.So the script writers were right to make a new version of that book.Now could we dream of remakes of 'you only live twice ' (without the gadgets but with the 'suicide' castle) and all the other novels transferred to the screen in the seventies and eighties which ,as the first four episodes did ,would roughly follow Fleming's plots?NB:Eva Green's mother ,Marlene Jobert ,was one of the biggest French stars of the late sixties/early seventies.",Null,4,7,28 December 2006
Trainspotting," sex, drugs and rock and roll
","One of the cult-movies made in the nineties, often compared (a bit wrongly) to 'A Clockwork Orange' (1971), 'Trainspotting ' is the revelation of a new talented director: Danny Boyle. If his previous movie 'Shallow Grave' (1994) was not accepted unanimously, 'Trainspotting' was critically praised and made a beautiful commercial way, notably in Great-Britain.Danny Boyle's opus is served by a galaxy of actors who are all outstanding (Ewan McGregor and Robert Carlyle at head) and whose characters are well-rounded. Moreover, McGregor's voice-over makes the movie more thrilling. It is to be noted that if Boyle perfectly used this device in 'Trainspotting' it will not be the case four years later with Leonardo Di Caprio in 'The Beach' (2000).Then, we deal with a dramatic story, it is indisputable but it is told on a comedy tone so as to avoid the movie to fall in absolute horror and the sordid and of course, this is often black humor that prevails.'Trainspotting' confirms Boyle's master of the directing too. Nevertheless, it includes faults that spoil somewhat the movie. For example, this one, by moments evokes a clip. Besides, in connection with music, there is an excellent original soundtrack even if sometimes we feel that its constant and discreet use surcharges the movie. On another hand, through Mark's trouble with heroin, this is a realistic vision of a British society undermined by unemployment in the eighties. Even if the last movie is full of optimism, it nonetheless remains ambiguous. Indeed, as Mark walks on the bridge and enumerates the things he will know, the picture becomes increasingly blurred. It probably means that Mark's future will not probably be bright...'Trainspotting' is a vivid, sometimes raw movie (the sequences that involves heroin) but never boring. It deserves to be watched.",7,3,8,5 March 2004
Space Jam," This movie merely aims at children
","Making a movie that mixes characters cartoons with actors in the flesh is a good idea so long as the plot must be interesting enough to sustain the interest. For 'Space jam', we're far from the result. With the exception of quite successful special effects and a plain performance of Michael Jordan, the movie is absolutely devoid of interest. It consists on a flat and trite story, a convenient and predictable screenplay. Moreover, Bugs Bunny and his friends are the kings of third-rate acting and make hardly the spectator laugh. In short, there is nearly nothing to save in this movie that will especially please to children.",3,5,14,13 June 2003
La Vie En Rose," Chanteuse extraordinaire!
","There will never be another Edith Piaf in France.She epitomizes the country.She was the only artist whose songs reflected her tragical fate.With few exceptions,all these songs are desperate songs ,from the wagnerian 'Hymne à l'Amour' which Marguerite Monnot composed after Cerdan's death -although some writers claimed it had been composed before- to 'Non,je ne Regrette Rien' which the singer recorded at a time when she was dying.Edith Piaf was the only popular artist who was embraced by intellectuals:Cocteau wrote a play for her and he died a few hours after her.Colette and Jean Anouilh were among her admirers.She had even fans in the world of rock/pop: Patti Smith ,Jeff Buckley (who covered 'j'n'en connais pas la fin' ,an obscure number from the thirties),Willy /Mink de Ville,Marianne Faithful (who made an exciting version of 'Les Prisons du Roy').Astrid the Beatles' German friend used to listen to her records too (see 'Backbeat')What am I driving at?Simply,this is a difficult,nay almost impossible subject.Guy Casaril's attempt ('Piaf' 1973 from Simone 'Momone' Berteau) was dismal and besides ,it stopped with Leplée's death.Even worse was Lelouch's 'Edith and Marcel' where Edith's voice was dubbed !!! (by a pop singer !).Olivier Dahan's did not probably make the definitive Piaf biopic -as users have already pointed out,it would take a miniseries:the half-sister's book ,a 700+ pages biography is impossible to transfer to the screen-but it's easily the best to date.Marion Cotillard easily outdistances her rivals (Brigitte Ariel and Evelyne Bouix)in a Cesar -calibre performance.If she does not get the award,it will be as unfair as Ellen Burnstyn losing her AA to Julia Roberts.The problem for Marion Cotillard will be to find a follow up to the French runaway blockbuster of the year...Olivier Dahan,flouting chronology ,chose key moments in Piaf's eventful life.One can regret that the songs are cut, particularly 'Milord' (which Cher covered in America) and 'Hymne à L'Amour' .Minor quibbles:the actor playing Cerdan is too refined,too 'playboy' to portray Cerdan successfully,a great boxer but an uneducated not-so-handsome man whose favourite reading was the Katzenjammers ('Pim Pam Poum' in French) and whom Piaf herself tried to cultivate his mind (she made him read ,reportedly Mary Webb's 'Sarn' );and Theo Sarapo's absence:he was her last love ,and a true love dedicated to her,he sweetened her awful last moments ,together they sang a duet which was a hit 'A Quoi ça Sert l'Amour?'Theo Sarapo (Sarapo= I love you in Greek) deserved a niche in Piaf's saga.Too bad.On the other hand,Piaf's faith in Sainte Thérèse de Lisieux remained intact (there is a pilgrimage in the movie) till her last breath.Although her funeral stopped the traffic in Paris ,she was refused a Christian ceremony,the church having declared that she lived in sin.Marlene Dietrich who was here (she briefly appears in the movie,played by Caroline Sihol;remember the German actress sang 'La Vie En Rose' in Hitchcock's 'stage fright' )cried out:'How much did they love her!'.Olivier Dahan made the best of the huge material which he had at his disposal.Some will complain cause Yves Montand and Charles Aznavour do not appear.But the same goes for Georges Moustaki,Mella (from 'les Compagnons de la Chanson', Felix Marten;even Henri Vidal was discovered by Piaf...And anyway as the chanteuse wrote:Dans le Ciel Plus de Problème, Dieu Réunit Ceux Qui s'Aiment.",8,6,11,8 October 2007
Signs," the happening (the Pixies)...
","Since 'the Sixth Sense' (1999), M Night Shyamalan has become a respectable filmmaker who continues his exploration of the supernatural. Each new movie is announced like a great event. After 'the Sixth Sense' (1999) and 'Unbreakable' (2000), 'Signs' was released in 2002 and as it was expected the movie was a worldwide blockbuster. A success widely deserved because the less we can say is that M Night Shyamalan's movie abounds in qualities, showing that he is able to go off Hollywood's beaten tracks to develop his peculiar style.First of all, it is obviously at the level of the directing that the talent of this young director shines. It is a real tour-de-force and the way he shots most sequences can only arouse admiration. It is also useful to add that several pictures are impressive (the air view of the crop circles).Then, from the beginning, an accumulation of weird details or sequences contributes to creating a disturbing and threatening atmosphere. Furthermore, the whole film takes place in the country and however, you are under the impression to be 'in camera'.But the main asset in 'Signs' is the following one. Quite obviously, M Night Shyamalan wanted to tell the story of an invasion of aliens on the earth. For this, he almost never leaves Mel Gibson's farm and its surroundings. Everything is suggested, notably through the television and the radio which both play the role of link with the world. Of course, this invasion doesn't spare Mel Gibson's farm, neither the neighborhood. During a big part of the movie, you can feel the presence of the aliens by their sounds, their shadows, you believe you can see them. In another extent, their characteristics, their traits are either supposed, either maintained through the characters' words. At last, the action sequences boil down to the minimum (when an alien grabs Rory Culkin by the nape of the neck, Mel Gibson drops his torch to rescue him and the camera remains pointed at the torch. Mel Gibson's efforts to save his son are suggested by the struggle sounds.To go on with the assets, we can also take down this one: there's a will to use the special effects at a minimum, especially for the Crop Circles. Besides, the Crop Circles look like the ones you find on the cover of the Led Zeppelin album 'Remasters'.There's also another positive point: the presentation of the characters. On this point, M Night Shyamalan clearly distinguishes himself from the other American directors. A lot of them would have first introduced the characters and then would have broached the plot. Not M Night Shyamalan! From the beginning, we get to the heart of the matter and the life of each character (Mel Gibson's family), why they are in the current situation is explained to us during the progression of the movieAt last, there's often a discreet and sustained use of the music that contributes to create highly emotional moments. With all these advantages, 'Signs' has all the elements to become a perfect movie. Unfortunately, the movie also contains a few shortcomings that keep it from becoming a masterpiece.Mel Gibson acts the role of a preacher who gave up his duties following his wife's death. It means that he lost his faith. But at the end of the adventure, he finds it again. In another hand, the two children reminded me of the ones you find in Spielberg's movies. I mean that they are the ones who discover the characteristics of the aliens. Then, I wonder if M Night Shyamalan drew from HG Wells' novel: 'War of the worlds'. In the novel, the aliens were killed by the microbes of the corpses and here, their 'bête noire' is simply water... Ultimately, in spite of a few weaknesses, 'Signs' confirms well a thing: M Night Shyamalan's skill to turn a trite topic into an awesome movie. Highly recommended and we deal with an author we must follow.",Null,30,57,8 April 2004
The Deer Hunter," to call it masterpiece is to state the obvious
","Of the first two American films about the Vietnam war with a priceless artistic weight, 'the Deer Hunter' wins hands down over 'Apocalypse Now' (1979) although Francis Ford Coppola's work is very potent too.But would it be judicious to pigeonhole Michael Cimino's work in the category of the war movie? Unlike Coppola's visual nightmare, only the central part takes place in Vietnam and the filmmaker barely shoots one fight sequence before Mike (Robert De Niro), Nick (Christopher Walken) and Stevie (John Savage) are prisoners of the enemy and are forced to play Russian roulette in the notorious unbearable scene. Actually 'the Deer Hunter' is a film straddling two movie genres: the war movie and the social drama. Rather than shooting a political film, Cimino chose to represent us the deadly impact this nightmarish war had on an American community whose hopes and values disappeared.Dividing his work in three parts: before, during, after and thanks to symbolical images, scenes or even eloquent details, Cimino used and honed his own cinematographic language to set out his stalls and the result can only command respect and admiration. Each sequence could be separately taken and carefully studied like the representation of the humdrum but reassuring living standards of the blue-collars with their everyday rituals (Cimino's obsession with rites and customs) revolving around factory, bar, friends and hunting (you have to admire the startling contrast between the dirty little town and the gorgeous, wild landscapes). Archetypal sequences that epitomize life and it reaches its height in the famous, unusually long wedding sequence. Perhaps Cimino wanted to stretch this sequence to make his characters take advantage of this rapture moment. But even during this state of bliss that lives inside them, the imminent tragedy ominously lurks: Mike and Nick gently laugh at an officer who remains dumb and when Stevie and his wife have to drink in a dish, some drops fall on her wedding dress. This sequence also epitomizes the polar opposite to the sequence of the Russian roulette in which death is just around the corner. After the war when Mike comes back to the small town, he's completely altered. Before, a devotee of deer hunting; after his traumatizing experience, he can't kill one. He's unable to talk about about what he went through and for his sidekicks, the experience of a war like this one is incomprehensible. Cimino eschews classical, predictable storytelling and hasn't recourse to psychological study. Nearly everything occurs in gestures and looks while the suggested has a meaty part in the dialogs. Besides, during the whole movie the topic of the war is barely mentioned by the characters. A lyrical whiff blows on the film, dovetailed by Cimino's astounding directing.Cimino was consumed with ambition and went at it hammer and tongs to get his crew completely involved in his project. He was hard on his actors (Robert De Niro has often said that 'the Deer Hunter' was his most grueling role to date) and was obsessed with absolute control. But the efforts weren't vain at all and gave a heartfelt, invaluable yardstick in war movie, even American cinema which reached the streets when America rose from its ruins. It was also the beginning of the end for Cimino, a filmmaker ahead of his time and on the fringe of cinematographic trends.",10,112,200,15 December 2006
Speed," faster... (like the Manic Street Preachers' song)
","Try to imagine this: a trapped bus that contains a bomb. It mustn't come down to 80 kilometres an hour, otherwise the bomb is exploding. This is about this interesting idea that Jan de Bont designed one of the most successful movies released in 1994. He made a spectacular and suspenseful action movie where he can constantly sustain the interest. Obviously, it contains a few implausibilities: in one sequence, the bus's managing to cross a bridge that is very large. Moreover, the movie also distills a kind humor. At the end, 'Speed' is an honorable success and Dennis Hopper is an excellent terrorist. As Alfred Hitchcock said: 'the more successful the bad guy is, the more successful the movie will be'.",Null,2,4,14 September 2003
Amélie," she didn't and she won't change my life
","This movie is at number 14 in the top 250. It was nominated in several categories for the oscars by March 2002. All around the world, Amélie Poulain elated millions of people. The question I ask myself is this one: why did this film make millions of people so happy? I saw it last year at the cinema; it's not that I didn't like it, it left me indifferent and I watched it very carelessly. A naive girl whose name is Amélie Poulain discovers what her destiny is: make people happy. She'll succeed in before she falls in love with a man (Mathieu Kassovitz). I think it's a lacklustre and dull film. The screenplay isn't very entertaining and it looks as if there is no plot. The main thema of the movie, which is for Amélie to make people happy, is more sketched out than really explored. Moreover, the dialogues are vain and most of the characters are talking for nothing. Above all, several sides of the film didn't please me, especially its humor. The movie wants to be funny but according to me, the humor usually falls flat and sometimes it can fade into the heaviness like the love scene in the cafe. There is something that I don't like in the Amélie Poulain's character; I think she is dope, a bit dumb and she's got very odd thoughts ( how many couples will have an orgasm in the next second!!!). Besides, the actors aren't very great. I mean that they aren't very well defined. We learn what they like or don't like but for most of them, their tastes or hates are only tics (like Jamel Debbouze who cherishes fruits and vegetables because he's a greengrocer). On the other hand, some elements of the film are useless and barely bring interest to the movie, I think about Amélie's father who loves his garden gnome, or the old man who tries hard to reproduce Renoir's painting 'le déjeuner des canotiers'. To sum up: Amélie's destiny's got nothing fabulous and it's a film that lacks of poetry and is a speading of clever visuals and ringing brainwaves.",1,25,58,8 August 2002
The Sixth Sense," I see dead people....
","Here comes Bruce Willis again in the skin of a rescuer! But unlike 'the fifth element' and 'armageddon', he mustn't save the whole wide world. Neither, must he save a group of persons from a terrorist threat as it was the case with 'die hard. No, he simply must save a little boy called Cole, haunted by morbid visions and Willis, a reputable psychologist tries hard to heal him... With 'fight club' and 'the blair witch project', 'the sixth sense' ranks among the best movies made in 1999. It also ranks among the movies that you must watch several times before really appreciating it. If you're watching this movie for the first time, you might be disappointed because there are numerous details that can escape your attention and however, they are important for the development of the story. The same thing can also be said for a few scenes, especially the one when Willis is in a restaurant with his wife facing him... Because the main strength of the movie is its screenplay. Rarely, a movie has been so well served by a watertight screenplay. It's disconcerting, disturbing and however perfectly coherent. For a long part, the movie is a beautiful 'trompe l'oeil'. On another hand, it's a pleasure to see Bruce Willis get out of his usual roles where he mostly plays the he-man. In 'the sixth sense', it's obvious that he's between the hands of a conscientious and well-organized director. But he isn't the main center of the movie. This place goes to Haley Joel Osment. His performance in the role of a tormented and neurotic boy is extraordinary. Besides, he can be considered as a faraway cousin of Danny, the little boy in Kubrick's 'shining' because they've got a common point: an odd power supernatural and all in all, the dead people who haunt Cole aren't so terrible as they look like: they're simply asking him for help... At the end, a fascinating movie held up by two great actors.",8,4,6,17 January 2003
Final Destination," death like time has got its own plans
","Without being an absolute masterpiece, 'Final Destination' is a good fantastic movie that deserves to be watched. It borrows several elements from other movies or novels such as 'Scream' or 'And then there were none' but it exploits them very well. And this is helped thanks to a clever script that includes a few qualities, notably this one: we can't really see death but we can feel its presence and its cleverness. Moreover, the suspense is well lead during all the movie until the end.But if 'Final Destination' isn't a masterpiece, it's because it also contains faults: for example, how can Alex, the hero of the film succeed in seeing these odd visions about 'accidents that are going to happen'? Then, he doesn't get on well with one of the main characters (you can consider him as his worst enemy) and however they'll be compelled to help each other in order to escape from death. You could also say that certain sequences are predictable while some are on the verge of unlikely.Nonetheless, a rather good fantastic movie.",Null,29,50,24 October 2003
The Truman Show," A true man shows
","This is among Pete Weir's best ,just a notch or two under 'fearless' or 'witness' and much more worthwhile than weepies like 'dead poets society'.Jim Carrey is ,relatively speaking,sparing of gestures and ,hem!grimaces.However,in my humble opinion ,the best performance comes from Laura Linney,who's very funny,delivering lines as she would do commercials,and always with that suave smile on her face:she really acts as if she's in a play,and she 's anyway, as Paul Mac Cartney sang in 'Penny Lane'.Ed Harris is effective as a sort of God (TV has replaced God in many a home,like it or not),his spectacles and his bonnet make him almost unrecognizable.The humanism displayed by Weir is very close to that of Frank Capra,and Jim Carrey is some kind of James Stewart of the nineties,naïve,with a big heart.And like Colombus (his boat isn't it called 'Santa Maria'?),he has discovered a brand new world.Whether it's the best one remains to be seen.",8,7,10,5 July 2001
The Matrix," What the hell is the 'Matrix?'
","Launched in 1999 and one of the most successful movies of the year, 'Matrix' is an amazing movie. It ranks among the movies that leave the spectator bemused, even after several projections.In a way, it's very similar to Paul Verhoeven's movie 'Total Recall' (1990). The two movies have got a complicated but mesmerizing screenplay, astounding special effects and especially, a main character with two faces: Keanu Reeves. It means that at the beginning of the movie, he's introduced as someone who leads a peaceful but common life. But an unexpected event will transform his life and make him a hero.'Matrix' is also a very well stable movie that you can divide in two parts: the first one mainly focuses on long dialogs sequences that incline to reflection while the second one honors stunning action sequences.A remarkable performance crowns it all and Keanu Reeves finds here his best role to date. The sole weakness of the movie is the love affair between Reeves and Laurence Fishburne. The Wachowski brothers felt compelled to include this, maybe to give their movie, a Hollywood nature.An awesome science-fiction film that easily ranks among the best movies of the nineties.",5,7,26,18 September 2003

Humor,like in Fredric's Brown tales?none,unless the two robots count. Mystery ,like in AC Clarke's 2001?none,unless Darth Vader 's hidden identity counts? The last quarter of the movie recalls a giant video game. After 'star wars'(and close encounters of the third kind) ,intellectual sci-fi was over the hill;now two kinds would share the market between them:the harmless sci-fi for toddlers and brats(Star War saga,ET,the black hole)and the horrific ,brainless and witless sci-fi (Alien and sequels)'2001' became an ET movie and its overwhelming genius did not influence anymore,alas.",6,3,13,8 August 2001
Hart's War," mission: escape
","The American film-maker Terrence Malick is sometimes nicknamed 'Hollywood's beautiful loser' due to his large absence. I think it is unfair. It is true that Malick's filmography isn't very dense but his movies are much better than Gregory Hoblit's. I would (sadely) grant without hesitation the quoted nickname to Hoblit. After a first promising movie 'Primal Fear' (1996) which owed a lot to Edward Norton, this director kept on discrediting himself throughout each movie he made. It is not this war movie 'Hart's War' (2002) that will try to show the contrary.I am writing to the people who didn't see this film. If you think that you deal with a war movie like 'Saving Private Ryan' (1998) well you are wrong. 'Hart's War' is a war movie without war! There's the share of shootings and explosions at the beginning of the movie but after that, the movie especially focuses on psychological tensions between the American soldiers. On another hand, the main star isn't Bruce Willis as the poster suggests but Colin Farrell who offers a quite impressive performance but his character remains too confined in Hollywood conventions to be really terrific. To come back to Bruce Willis, during the most important part of the film, we wonder what is his real function in the story. The answer only appears at the end of the movie (it obeys to Hoblit's will to keep the best till last) and I won't reveal it.What is wrong with 'Hart's War'? Simply, this movie is handicapped with glaring implausibilities which deals a severe to the credibility of the plan.First the action of the film takes place in the beginning of 1945. It isn't the ideal time for this kind of story for the simple and good reason that the Second World War was almost finished in Europe. For German troops, it was the debacle and they didn't hesitate in setting the American soldiers free from the camps in which they were imprisoned.Then, the Nazis were keen on Hitler's racist theses contending the supremacy of the Aryan race and the extinction of the Jews, the black etc... But if the black American soldier was charged with murder, why didn't they kill him instead of letting Willis organizing a real trial for him? I think Hoblit tried to avoid a tempting caricature towards the German soldiers and to grant them a little light of humanity. But it is hard to believe that one of the German leaders studied in Yale and is fond of Afro-American jazz music.In another extent, the director offers a neutral and sanitized image of life of American prisoners in the camp. We see American prisoners playing cards, ball or having fun (whereas beside them there are Russian prisoners who are working). However, it is certain that life in those camps was tough and German soldiers were surely manhandling their prisoners.As for the trial, I think it is only of minor interest and Hoblit has no hesitation in denouncing racial injustices through the lieutenant Lincoln A Scott. Behind this trial, an escape plan is setting in motion and it is a hare-brained one: how did the Americans manage to find the useful tools to dig their tunnel? By the way, the movie wouldn't be full without the inevitable (and very American) final moral which ends up tarnishing Hoblit's work.What have we got at the end? A poor war movie with an artificial construction and where the politically correct is 'de rigueur'. It also testifies a sadder thing: the (definitve?) loss of a talent: Gregory Hoblit.",4,2,8,22 December 2004
Cube," Where' pi 'fails,'cube' succeeds.
","Word to the wise:I urge the people who enjoyed 'cube' to try to see the made-for-TV British 'A child's play',(1985)part of the series 'Hammer house of suspense and mystery' starring the late Nicholas Clay.In spite of a very poor(and unfair) rating,it's really worthwhile and the connection with 'cube' is glaring,even if the Val Guest TV film has a 'rational' explanation.As people have pointed out,a movie does not need a rational solution to be enthralling.if such was the case,'2001 ' and 'the birds' ,to name but two,would not be world-wide favorites .And 'cube' is brimming with originality,and like the two mentioned movies,it may have as many interpretations as there are potential commenting users.Visually ,the movie is a splendor,all shrouded in red and orange light,glorifying geometry and arithmetic:this is really the mathematical movie which 'pi' wasn't:prime numbers and the Descartes analytical geometry are shrewdly introduced in the plot.All that remains is mathematics when a world has lost its way,morally and psychologically.And even mathematic lets you down when you meet human stupidity,as the young 'numbers' girl will discover.Only a lunatic can survive in such a world.He does.",7,6,13,29 March 2002

It is smartly directed by Robert Zemeckis who knows how to sustain the spectator's interest thanks to a story that becomes thrilling and fascinating in its design and it contains several odd details or sequences. Even if the movie contains a few faults (characteristic of Hollywood blockbusters) like for instance the love affair between Foster and Matthew McConaughey, its main advantage is definitely the talented Jodie Foster.Another fault which is more serious is about the conclusion of the movie. Indeed, it turns out to be a little disappointing because too childish.This said, you are entitled to prefer 'Contact' to the conceited 'Independence Day' (1996) or the whacky 'Mars Attacks' (1996).",Null,0,0,30 October 2003
Donnie Darko," Donny and the bunny man
","Donnie Darko is a brainy but depressed teenager. Between a familial cocoon on the verge of splitting up and a conformist high school, he's suffocating. His only real friend is a giant rabbit named Frank. The latter orders him to commit acts of violence and predicts him the end of the world in 28 days, 06 hours, 42 minutes and 12 seconds......And this is what grabbed my attention about the American independent movie made by a 26 year old young director, Richard Kelly. I was amazed at the general enthusiasm on this site around this flick while knowing it opened around the world with little hype (in France, it had a very quiet opening). 'Donnie Darko' could occupy a prominent place among the movies which were sleepers at the time of their release but which gained the status of cult-movie. I have heard about it thanks to one of my favorite bands: Echo and the Bunnymen. Their grand song 'the Killing Moon' opens a movie which in its first quarter of an hour presents a series of sequences drastically different in the content and form (from the moment when Donnie awakes in the country to the presentation of his high school to the first apparition of Frank, the rabbit). The first merit we can attribute to Kelly's flick is having gathered several cinema genres in a sole genuine story (fantastic, comedy, drama, thriller, teenage movie). This variety is equaled by the liberty of tones that characterizes the movie. Going from fantasizing to realism, swinging from fantastic to comedy as if it followed naturally, Kelly also excels in imposing climates. The more the movies goes on, the more intensity it accumulates. An intensity that Kelly controls without extreme special effects and by little touches, notably with the apparitions of the evil rabbit which pepper the work. This creature is a kind of witness of Donnie's troubled mind.As a matter of fact, the movie wavers nearly all the time between 2 poles: the exterior world and Donnie's inner psycho. We penetrate in the tormented mind of a teenager who is prey to a profound discontentment and especially rebelled against the world that surrounds him. By committing odd and alarming acts suggested by Frank, he expresses his contempt and his hate for this shameful world. So, in a way Frank is the intermediary point between Donnie's mind and his exterior contact.But these acts are for Kelly an excellent means to break the deceitful appearances and to remove masks of hateful characters. To a second degree, 'Donnie Darko' is adorned with a scathing social critic whose target is especially the education system. This one is ossified, remains paralyzed in its conformist educational methods. One of its goals is turning young female pupils in pompom girls! And in one memorable sequence, the headmaster rejects Drew Barrymore's educational methods without explaining why! The critic is still more acid when the teachers welcomes nearly with open arms a persuasive preacher (an unexpected Patrick Swayze) who claims knowing how to crush fear thanks to a total master of positive energy. Ultimately, it is total idolatry or credulity for shameless charlatanism that the movie also attacks and when we learn Swayze's hidden secret, the satire is extra intense.Furthermore, Kelly also skilfully incorporated elements of teenage movie in his rich work and these elements are generally the ones which are put aside in teenage movies. The most important one is the difficulties of communication between teenagers and their parents. Donnie suffers but his parents (even his girlfriend or close relatives) are incapable of understanding him, although they seem to agree their son on certain points like the education in his school. Even his analysis sessions are of little help for him. What can he do? Perhaps contemplating the possibility of time travel...As for the cast, it alternates good and, let's say, less good surprises. The best: Jake Gyllenhaal is a real revelation, both frail and disturbing. The actress who acts his gym teacher also stands out even if she acts a grotesque character. But thanks to this, the movie is blessed with comic moments of a high quality. Then, I have always thought that Patrick Swayze had limited gifts as an actor but here, he is cast against type in a role for which he was the ideal man. However, the choice of Drew Barrymore for the young literature teacher is debatable. She's not bad at all but she was too young for the role (this is my opinion).I don't want to reveal the end but with it we could write that we've come full circle. It ends a movie which opens prospects to any possible interpretations. Not meant pejoratively, the screenplay has a good packet of holes or ambiguous points. Moreover, the logic behind the whole story is hard to perceive. The truth finds itself neither in Donnie's mind, nor in the exterior world. Maybe in every viewer's opinion. I address to the people who haven't watched 'Donnie Darko': if you wish to watch it and at the end of the first projection you feel bemused, don't reject it like I did. Like 'Jacob's Ladder' (1990), like 'the Sixth Sense' (1999), it requires several viewings before the qualities of Kelly's work reveal themselves before our eyes. An undeniable tour-de-force in the teenage movie as well as a readable work on several levels, spanning fantastic movie, teenage movie and social satire, 'Donnie Darko' should attract any movie-goer given it doesn't necessarily target a specific category of viewers.",9,5,13,12 June 2005
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," the best Indiana Jones movie ever?
","The third and the best of the adventures of Indiana Jones. In this new film, the famous archeologist is searching for a mythical object: 'the Graal'. This is the glass in which the Christ would have drank during the last meal with his apostles. His father assists him in his investigations because he's got precious information about the Graal. So, a long trip begins and will lead our two heroes from Venice to the Middle East in passing by Berlin. You can guess it, this trip has got its rough patches (otherwise the movie would appear devoid of interest). Indeed, the Nazis wish to discover the Graal too because it would make them powerful even dangerous.Steven Spielberg designed his movie like a fascinating treasure hunt and he had the good idea by bringing Sean Connery. Thanks to his presence, the movie's got a certain humor (perhaps a little too convenient but the result works) and allows to lighten the movie.'Indiana Jones and the last crusade' is also a good surprise because it wipes out the unhappy memory of the previous movie: 'Indiana Jones and the temple of doom'. I found it too horrendous, bloody and even annoying due to Kate Capshaw. Here, to film Indiana Jones' incredible adventures, Spielberg adopted a dramatic and especially efficient film-making. He also avoids all that could make the movie fall in the faults quoted in the second movie. Moreover, there aren't any injury times, the rhythm is skilfully sustained (particularly during the pursuits) and it's better this way because the result is very convincing. Obviously, the movie doesn't go without a few unlikelinesses.Spielberg also brilliantly used the good old recipes for the adventure film: weird and exotic sceneries, the struggle between good and evil, the magic object that possesses supernatural powers etc...The only criticism I have to make of Spielberg is that the screenplay is perhaps well boosted but it doesn't also succeed in hiding a certain manicheism: the Nazis wish to get rid of Jones and his father and to discover the Graal would help them to satisfy their strength.An adventure movie entertaining enough to sustain the interest and rather well performed. Let's add the imposing music (as usual) composed by John Williams.",8,33,67,7 May 2003
The Birds," A short story turned into a two-hour movie.
","Daphné Du Maurier's work is a short story,which characters are not those depicted in the movie.But Hitchcock did not betray the writer.His ending is as open as that of Du Maurier.It's one of the very rare Hitch movie that does not feature the de rigueur happy end,although some other finals are dark (see 'shadow of a doubt','psycho','the rope') Only the material for a short,hence the necessity to develop the plot,to replace the initial family of farmers,complete with children ,by thoroughly new characters:this is the main flaw of this movie:Annie (Pleshette) seems reduced to a walk-on:it seems that her relations with Mitch's mother are the cause for their breaking off.The mother has almost always been part of the Hitchcock 's universe (check 'psycho','strangers on a train' 'Marnie'- on a tragic mode-,and 'north by norwest' , 'to catch a thief'-on a comic one-)Jessica Tandy is a remote mother,but overpossessive.Tippi Hedren's character is a banal one:a spoiled rich kid ,who encounters another stereotype:the strong and surlybig-hearted he-man (Rod Taylor). Hitchcock's genius shines in his direction:the scene that shows Hedren sitting on a bench near the school,while one by one the birds are arriving is an absolute classic,plundered by too many directors.In the indispensable Truffaut book,we discover that the master used to draw his scenes before filming them;the drawings from the scene I talk about above are downright fascinating.All the scenes which feature the birds are extraordinary and a lot of disaster films with bigger budgets cannot hold a candle to them. And did you notice that in Perkins's office ('Psycho',the precedent movie),stuffed birds were waiting???..",9,2,4,2 August 2001
Jurassic Park," worth seeing for its special effects
","Who has ever dreamt of making a movie which the action would take place during our era with dinosaurs in the main roles. Steven Spielberg must have had the idea by thinking: 'it would get a huge commercial success...'. He aimed straight. Indeed, a few months after the launch of the movie in 1993, the movie beat the record of the box-office takings so far hold by E.T. by the same Spielberg. But this commercial triumph is especially due to a great marketing campaign organized around the movie. Like 'Batman', 'Jurassic Park' ranks among the movies that made a dramatic commercial way, mainly due to a strategic marketing campaign but which the movie, in itself, is devoid of interest.The movie, actually, is worth seeing for its dramatic special effects (thanks to them, the movie won three Oscars in Hollywood in 1994). They can only encourage admiration and take the breathe away. Spielberg only intervened the most famous species of dinosaurs such as the tyrannosaurus and I think it's a pity that you don't see many other species. For example, you don't see the pterodactyl. Besides, you could say that dinosaurs were the sole attraction of the movie for an important number of spectators and it's why the movie attracted masses of people in theaters when the movie was released.But if you take away this quality, the movie appears devoid of interest. The scantiness and the lack of inspiration of the screenplay are something that you feel. The screenplay follows an outline quite predictable: it starts with the explanations concerning the creation of the park and especially the dinosaurs ( well done, nevertheless to he scriptwriters who could show cleverness concerning the artificial birth of the dinosaurs. Then, the movie goes on with the visit and the discovery (inconclusive as dinosaurs don't appear) of the park and this is where problems appear (otherwise the movie wouldn't have existed): a storm is breaking, a bad engineer is switching the current off to steal dinosaurs embryos for his personal interests. More serious, dinosaurs are getting away and spreading panic among the visitors....You can also notice that the screenplay contains several silly cues and characters appear colorless. They are overburden by dinosaurs that are real stars of the movie. it also  doesn't succeed in hiding a few unlikelinesses: Tim, one of the two children is victim of a strong electric shock and however Sam Neil manages to save him! Moreover, Tim's sister succeeds in locking a dinosaur up in a room thanks to a code which is however, hard to get. So, children are in the depths of these unlikelinesses and it probably reflects Spielberg' tender look of childhood.At the end, 'Jurassic Park' is definitely one of Spielberg's worst movies.",1,26,114,24 April 2003
Beetlejuice," ghosts against ghosts
","In 1988, prior to the inordinate success of 'Batman' (1989) which would line his pockets, Tim Burton bequeathed this work which is from his own words: 'a comical version of 'the Exorcist' told from two dead people's point of view'. I have never been a fan of William Friedkin's masquerade marred by extravagant, ludicrous special effects.There are also special effects in 'Beetle Juice' and they constituted the main attraction for many viewers when the film was released. But unlike Friedkin's enticing work they're much better tapped to serve as complements for the needs of the story but also to depict the beyond after death for Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin. On this point, one recognizes with pleasure Burton's trademark. The filmmaker had visibly pleasure to recreate a quirky vision of hell enhanced by extravagant scenery with rather loud colors and populated with funny monsters. This hellish universe has the look of a public services office.Another positive thing about 'Beetle Juice' is that it never really falls into the excessive or the very grim and genteel humor is also an asset for the film. The story has genuine looks in its beginning but takes a derivative direction as the film advances and certain characters verge on the space of cardboard characters. But the actors seemed to be well aware of this problem and perhaps that's why they offer subdued, enjoyable performances. But the prize for the best actor arguably goes to Michael Keaton as the grouchy, dangerous Beetle Juice, absolutely unrecognizable under his make-up.'Beetle Juice' hasn't got really its place among Burton's seminal works like 'Edward Scissorhands' (1990), 'Ed Wood' (1994) or 'Big Fish' (2003) but if the filmmaker's set of themes and stylish job is your cup of tea, why not give it a chance?",7,0,1,19 November 2006
All the President's Men," Alan J. Pakula's peak
","Along with 'Klute' (1971) and 'the Parallax View' (1974), 'All the President's Men' represents the pinnacle of Alan J. Pakula's career in the seventies. The definitive proof that not only was political film his forte in the seventies but also that this decade was his heyday. Then the slump began in the eighties during which he had a stab at other kind of cinematographic genres and reached the bottom in the nineties with fiascoes such as 'the Pelican Brief' (1993), an unconvincing attempt to find the spirit of the conspiracy movie again or 'the Devil's Own' (1997), created in chaos.But back in 1976, he shone with this political thriller which related the scandalous Watergate affair from the relentless investigation two journalists Woodward (Robert Redford) and Bernstein (Dustin Hoffman) undertook. They had flair, used their reasoning and deduction faculties in a stalwart way without giving in too much to discouragement to reconstitute with tenacity and accuracy this scandal which will lead to the resignation of Nixon. All this throughout countless phone calls, conversations with witnesses who were however often reluctant to talk, intensive researches. More than half of the movie occurs in the editorial office and not only has Pakula a sense of space to make this place bright but also to captivate the viewer's attention while the two journalists pore over their research and discoveries. Technically speaking, his film commands admiration and respect: helped by the topnotch work of his photograph Gordon Willis, his camera work shines throughout the work which is also scattered by first-class sequences. The very last one of course and one of my favorites is the following one: when Hoffman goes to Redford's apartment to inform him of his new discoveries, the latter turns up the music very loud, then he begins to type on the typewriter and incites his companion to communicate through this scheme because there are mikes in the room. An ingenious way to eschew one trap their enemies set. Because all the ones who were involved in this affair try to hush it up.An affair painstakingly reconstituted as well as a documentary about the American press's work methods, a faultless directing, a visual, technical splendor and a topflight performance, what more could you ask for from a cracker that can stand (or rather) encourages multiple viewings?",9,3,5,6 May 2006
The Island," Derivative
","I had a sensation of déjà vu all along the movie: 1)The main source seems to be 'Logan's run' (1976).Lincoln and Sarah are Logan and Jessica and the lottery (how subtle!) replaces the carousel (it is a bit less impressive).And the Sanctuary becomes the Island.The unfortunate(?) inhabitants are all dressed in white,which gives at least one good sequence ,the last one ,although,once again, it's a 'Logan's run' rip off...2)The transplants come directly from Michael Crichton's 'coma'(1977),and the huge room with all the bodies also comes from the same film .3)When they leave the place ,there are snatches of 'the village' .Steve Bucemi lets the cat out of the bag then and there is no real surprise afterwards.They should not have revealed the 'big' unexpected twist of the movie so soon.4) How many times have we seen these car chases ?Nothing new under the sun.It was new in 'Bullitt' (1968);it was exciting in 'speed'(1994) ;now it's simply déjà vu.5)When Lincoln meets the 'real him ' ,it is often involuntarily funny and recalls 'Multiplicity'.6°And last but not least,the so-called 'island in the sun' uses the old Nazi methods!(leave your stuff before entering)",Null,1,2,29 December 2006
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," an original movie by the Coen brothers
","I liked 'O Brother, where art thou?' although I've never been a fan of the Coen brothers. It is a funny idea to transpose 'the odyssey' by Homère in America during the Great Depression in the thirties. This movie is a rather successful parody of Homère's story. Here, for instance, the three women by the stream replaced the mermaids and Penny (George Clooney's former wife) is a derivative of Penelope. Moreover, John Goodman took the role of the cyclops. The Coen brothers also obviously aimed at parodying several episodes of the Bible, notably in the last sequence with the flood.I also thought that the personality of the three main actors was very similar to Candide, the famous character created by the French writer Voltaire in the eighteenth century: they go through all kinds of adventure, either funny either dramatic in which they don't learn their lessons.If the humor isn't always well used in a relevant way or sometimes in a clumsy way, a few sequences are particularly successful: the Ku-Klux-Klan one. The music is also judiciously chosen and lends itself perfectly to the setting of the era. It's the same thing for the costumes.An original movie in which the directors don't think twice before laughing at their trio of actors. They're laughing at their credulity.",Null,2,3,23 January 2004
