United 93," Emotional
","I have just finished watching this movie and am very emotional. I believe they have done their best to depict what happened on flight United 93 and would recommend anyone to watch it.Even though we knew the outcome we were still on the edge of our seat willing the 'heros' to succeed and save the flight. Incredible viewing, though not from a movie buff's point of view. It is so hard to imagine being in the shoes of the passengers yet the movie brings you close enough to try.The DVD contains extras where the actors meet with the families who are still living with their tragedy everyday. Some of who dies had very young children at home and families yet still they gave their lives to try to save others. Incredibly moving.",10,1,3,20 October 2006
