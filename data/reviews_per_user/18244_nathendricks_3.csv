Raiders of the Lost Ark," Probably my all time favorite film
","I love Raider's of the Lost Ark, and all the other Indy movies. This movie has everything. A daring adventurer, swashbuckling, the ultimate bad guys, some of the best fight scenes ever made, and most important: A good story.The film never leaves you dragging. It has excellent characters and memorable scenes.Especially when Indy comes face to face with a swordsman. You think that Indy is going to bring out his whip and have an incredible fight scene with this master swordsman. Masses of people crowd around the two waiting for something to happen. Indy has a face showing that he doesn't have time for this, so he casually takes out his revolver and shoots the swordsman.An excellent movie.",10,0,0,1 August 2005
Jaws," Excellent
","I loved this film. After catching bit's and pieces of it on the TV, I finally rented it on DVD and watched it all the way through.It is very good. The best part is actually the music. John Williams composes an unbelievable score (like all the other songs he has composed). The music is simply amazing and one of my favorite soundtracks.I like the characters. You have a rough veteran of the sea who has seen his share of death, an ocean scientists (I can't remember the correct term for that occupation), and a police chief who hates the water.The movie is excellent and a must see. Spielberg is a brilliant director.",10,1,3,2 August 2005
The Truman Show," A Good movie
","Wow. This movie is great. I love the end! This is an excellent movie with a very original plot line. One of Jim Carrey's best films.Truman thinks he lives a normal life but discovers that his entire life has just been a TV show. Nothing is real. He starts to discover all sorts of different things that are not...normal. He begins to wonder why his wife describes different food products in detail and how they are better than others.I am not going to say much more, except that this is a must see movie and in case I don't see ya...Good afternoon, good evening, and goodnight!",10,0,0,3 August 2005
