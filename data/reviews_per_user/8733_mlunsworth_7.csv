Skyfall," Welcome back 007, it's been too long!
","With the temporary glitch from Quantum of Solace and then the suspension of filming due to financial troubles, it seemed that Bond's best days were far behind him. Surely whatever followed would be better no matter what we saw. Oh how true this is. Four years later, Skyfall doesn't just surpass expectations; it smashes them and then some. With the longest running Bond film ever at two hours twenty two minutes, Sam Mendes has given us a very satisfying Bond entry; everything hits the spot: the narrative structure, the development of characterisation (allowed to be explored even further thanks to the simple plot), the action sets and locations (despite most of the film being set in England which surprised me), I couldn't fault the film at all. It's one of those films where I couldn't stop smiling throughout. From the adrenaline fuelled ten minute pre-title sequence, Adele's fantastic Bond song, to a very intense and emotional ending, Mendes has created a landmark Bond film. It's sophisticated, clever, original, and plays homage to the conventions that defined Bond all those years ago – the gadgets, vintage cars, subtle humour, and of course Javier Bardem's hide out, an island full of crumbling ruins which has all the splendour of Stromberg's floating palace and Blofeld's volcanic base. The acting is top notch. The chemistry between Bond and M is so real it feels there really has been a 50 year history between the two. M's character is explored deeply, as is James Bond's, more so in the gripping and spectacular final scene in Scotland. Javier Bardem gives us simply an Oscar-worthy performance as one of the most disturbing Bond villains ever, and the supporting cast is outstanding, with Albert Finney, Ralph Fiennes and Naomie Harris all on hand to help our hero.My only criticism would be the positioning of the gun barrel sequence, again; it feels misplaced at the end, but hey, you can't have everything. This oozes class, and Mr Craig has well and truly moulded into the role, and I can't wait to see what he does for Bond 24 in 2014. Dare I say it, the best Bond film ever? Happy 50th anniversary Mr Bond! An absolute pleasure to watch.",8,9,29,27 October 2012
Quantum of Solace," The name's not Bond...
","OK, so here's what I heard about this film before I went to see it - it's not your average James Bond film, the directing is all messed up, and there's no real story.If I'm honest, I was more disappointed than happy with this film. For a start, why have they moved the opening gun barrel sequence to the end? It would have been perfectly fine at the beginning of the film like the previous 21 Bond movies. I was also annoyed at the continuous action scenes, dismal running length and the Bond Song. And Bond doesn't even have time to say his name's Bond, James Bond. The action sequences are cut quickly, with fast paced editing, and reminded me more of a Jason Bourne film than a Bond movie, but credit has to be given to Craig for doing most of the stunt work.QoS lacks the gadgets, Bond's car, the suspense, and most importantly, the Bond theme music itself. It even leaves out Q and Moneypenny.Out of the negative sides, there is also a brief positive side to the film - Daniel Craig is amazing as Bond, and I hope to see him in at least two more films. If you're watching this just for the action, then you're in for a treat. The ending location at the hotel is also a reminder of the traditional Bond hideouts from the early days. Other than that, the film did nothing for me.Overall, director Marc Forster has made a right mess of the film, and I'm sorry to say this, but even Die Another Day was better than this so called 'Bond' film. Any fans wanting to see the film, be aware; you'll generally be in for a shock.Let's hope Bond 23 goes back to the originality territory.",6,6,10,1 November 2008
Insidious," Delirious. Mysterious. This is Insidious...
","With the makers of the original Saw and Paranormal Activity behind this, I was very intrigued to see how they would deliver a new angle to the haunted house premise. The result? A deliciously neat, scary and tense (if not, a bit ridiculous) ride which should please most horror fans.Insidious is creepy for all the right and wrong reasons. Yes, it's very tense in parts, and the supernatural forces that overpower the house are enough to make even the toughest of people jump out of their seats, but when old women start wearing gas masks to talk to spirits, and ghouls start looking something like Darth Maul, you'll start to find it very creepy indeed. It also features two idiotic and not-so-amusing policemen, who really don't fit in place for this horror film, and should belong in a scene from something like Ghostbusters, and the final part may seem a bit far-fetched and OTT. However, even though it may drag on in parts, Insidious is better than your average standard haunted house tale.The film does very well on the shock factor, and never have I been in a packed cinema where most of the audience scream out loud and fix themselves solidly to the screen for the 98 minute run. James Wan certainly knows how to satisfy his audience, and Insidous will certainly play on your imagination, even if it may be for all the wrong reasons.So if you're a fan of the genre and like films such as Poltergeist, Paranormal Activity and The Amityville Horror, this'll be perfect for you as it's simply great haunted-house-horror. And it wouldn't be right if the makers of Saw didn't include a final twist at the end. Well, watch this until the very last scene and you'll be in for a subtle treat. I'm sure a sequel will be soon to follow. 6/10",6,3,7,9 May 2011
2012," The Countdown to oblivion
","Subtlety is without a doubt at the bottom of director Roland Emmerich's films, and the excitement of going to see his latest disaster movie pretty much ended midway through the film. Despite the CGI effects being top notch, the film quickly descended into absurdity and disbelief, and looked as if I was watching something from the 'effects gag reel' of The Day After Tomorrow.Sadly, the idea of the ancient prediction about the world ending in 2012 is chucked away in the first 10 minutes or so, which leaves the rest of the film open to an unrealistic structure, and a lazy, unimaginative script, involving John Cusack's character with a highly embarrassing sub-plot about his family issues. How can a film that cost millions to make get tangled up in a senseless script that descends into its own non-logical manner? Taking all of this into account (and the fact that the film is just a pinch too long), Emmerich has yet again stunned us with his visual effects, and is easily the best point to emerge from this disaster flick.I really do hope that the world does end in 2012, because then, films like this that spend so much money on trying to make a good film, won't be made any more.",5,1,5,13 November 2009
Jurassic World," A World of Fun
","Jurassic Park was a masterpiece. Not just because Steven Spielberg was at the heart of it, but because it re-defined the blockbuster and was the benchmark for all CGI films since. I was a huge fan of the first film, and some aspects of the second (let's not talk about the third), so for me this fourth instalment had to reflect back to its roots yet cater for today's audience, whilst still being fun and exciting at the same time. The anticipation for this was huge, a must see film of 2015, and thankfully it didn't disappoint, but it was by no means perfect.The plot is basic. Dr Hammond's (the late great Richard Attenborough) vision of a dinosaur theme park is now a reality. They make a genetically modified dinosaur. The dinosaur escapes. All hell breaks loose. Simple. Sadly the script won't win an Oscar anytime soon, but it's woven through so the narrative structure gets us right to the action and scares as soon as possible.Colin Trevorrow (fairly new at this game) directs, and pays homage to the original in a nice way with subtle references, and a rather nostalgic nod mid-way, revealing some familiar props used in the first film - it makes the 'kid' bit come right out again. And what can we say about the so called (rumoured) Indiana Jones that is Chris Pratt? Highly watchable, and just about gets through his role as the park's answer to Dr Dolittle. (Look out for Raptors with blue-tooth headsets). Even the return of the T-Rex for the film's climax will satisfy fans to the very ending shot. And not forgetting that immense soundtrack, which is dished out in all the right places, most notably, the first establishing shot of the theme park, executed very well from a hotel window. Having said all this, it's by no means original or inventive, and the characters are very clichéd and cheesy, and it does feel like all the deleted scenes from the original trilogy rolled into one film. It's entertaining, but not amazing.A reinvented thrill ride that will please all fans of the original, and once again just look in awe at those amazing special effects. Highly enjoyable, it's the best instalment since the first, but just watch out – the franchise isn't extinct yet. I doubt we've seen the last from Isla Nublar.",7,4,13,20 June 2015
Prometheus," In the cinema, no one can hear you scream... Because of that OTT background orchestral music!
","A lot of negativity associated with this film comes from the fact that it is nowhere near as good as the first Alien, but people have to realise that this isn't really part of the main series. It's completely separate. What are we given here? A detailed and well thought out view, maybe a little confusing in parts, of the origins of the infamous alien species.The basic story follows a group of scientists travelling to where the action takes place in Alien and Aliens; as they try to discover clues to the origins of mankind. The casting is a little hit and miss, but Michael Fassbender's android called David is very creepy and disturbing, and easily steels the show.The technology Ridley Scott missed out on in the 70's has been dished out aplenty here; one wonders what the original Alien would be like if it got remade. This is the beauty of Scott's idea for Prometheus: to never repeat but to simply make us aware and to keep the alien presence is a mere afterthought. This is not a remake nor sequel but something completely original which works really well.Despite the very loud annoying background score which takes away a lot of the potential shocks, there is still plenty of tension, and of course the ever present themes of body horror and giving birth, such key factors to the original films are portrayed in one grisly standalone scene which exploits these themes.The less you think of the original series the more you'll enjoy this. Yes, the hype was over the top and sadly you may walk out of this film thinking what all the fuss was about. It is without a doubt a brilliant piece of film-making, the cinematography is greatly executed, and despite feeling a little jumbled in parts, it's visually stunning, and simply an exhilarating cinematic experience - and yes, they even leave it open for another film, a sort of sequel to the prequel... The last few scenes have subtle references to the opening scenes of the first Alien film, and will no doubt wet your appetite to re-visit the original; which is exactly what I did. Ridley Scott once again shines here. 7/10.",7,1,4,6 June 2012
Live Free or Die Hard," Better than 2 and 3, and next to 1
","With the controversy of the USA rating of the film aside (the b.b.f.c. yet again gave a '15' certificate like 2 and 3), the fourth instalment of the die hard franchise lives up to its predecessors, expanding the franchise even further - die hard 1 centred terrorists in a skyscraper, die hard 2 in an airport (slightly bigger), die hard 3 set in a city (bigger), and die hard 4 set across the entire USA (huge). This evolution of the core plot allows die hard 4 to be bigger, better and even a little over the top, but works well, allowing for plenty of action, thrills.. and a car crashing into a chopper. Bruce Willis reprises his role as the fearless John McLane, who is now over his fear of flying. Fans will be glad that McLane gets the job done in the same manner as the previous films, in the cool and calm manner that every guy wishes they could be. Despite his famous catchphrase being disrupted with a gun shot and the lack of strong language, die hard 4 still has the brutal fighting and gory deaths, including someone meeting a nasty end in a grinder. It's been 12 years since dh3, too long in my opinion. Whatever happened to the two year gap between sequels? Better than 2 and 3, Die Hard 4 is a refreshing breath of fresh air for (excuse the pun) die-hard fans, which lives up to its title. Worth watching, and is one to buy when it comes out on DVD. 9/10.",7,2,5,24 July 2007
