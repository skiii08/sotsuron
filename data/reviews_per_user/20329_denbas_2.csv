Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Great
","I don't understand why many people where disappointed by this movie, they said that the story was not good and could not convince them. First of all 'how would you begin to tell a story like Star Wars?'. I think that George Lucas took the right way to begin to tell the Star Wars saga. Another point is that the German translation was really s***, and this is also a reason why many people in Germany found this Star Wars movie disappointing. But who has seen this movie in English, knows that this is one of the greatest movies. A movie with great special effects. Fantastic!",Null,0,0,26 September 2000
Contact," A question of faith
","I understand why in Germany the audience was disappointed and why this movie was not so long in the German cinemas like other movies. This movie was called a science-fiction movie and when the people saw it, they thought to find more than that. Yes, it might be also a science-fiction movie, but it is more than that. It's a movie about faith, faith in the fact that we are not alone in the universe and that we are only a microscopic part of it. Also faith in the fact that there is a power which guides us, keeps on moving the universe and watches over us. This power is for example for some people God, for some  people Allah or for others the cosmic powers.In the sentence 'The truth is out there' from X-Files, is much more truth in it than it seems at first sight. Great movie!",Null,0,2,4 October 2000
