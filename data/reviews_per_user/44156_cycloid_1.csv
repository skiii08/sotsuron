Lucky Number Slevin," Thinks it's the Usual Suspects, but it's not
","Note, this review contains plot elements and spoilers, so don't read it if you want to remain in the dark.First to set the record straight, I LOVED the first half to two-thirds of this movie, the mistaken identity plot line, Morgan and Ben's characters and the light humour and scooby-doo style investigation by Lucy Liu's character. But whilst the writer did have some strong ideas they seem to have run out and he just slapped on a twist ending, before going back to the start of the script to add in Bruce Willis' first scene to tie it all together (indeed what is the POINT of BW in this film? aside from standing around in a trench coat and just repeating bits of Last Man Standing?).One plot hole that reveals this is the Kansas City Shuffle itself. Nick Baker may have needed to be unavailable for the long con to work, but they didn't need his body for the hit on the Fairy. Swapping watches and burning the body to make out that it was Slevin's was made pointless as he instantly reappeared the very next scene and even 'connected' with the Policeman who'd been on his back. The job looked like a job so no body was needed to make it not look like a job.This is not one of those films that you watch three or four times and see clues and revelations each time, sure they're probably there (most are shown at the end anyway) but like i said, most of it is actually good fun and lucy liu is the cutest girl you could possibly ever want to live across the hall from, i'd go as far as to say this is her sexiest role to date because of that.Conclusion: OK for a Saturday night in, but make it the first film you watch that night",6,1,4,26 September 2006
