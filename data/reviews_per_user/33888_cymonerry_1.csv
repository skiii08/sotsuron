The New World," Genesis of genocide
","This is a tough movie to get through, mainly because it tries to be as historically accurate as it can. You can easily get annoyed by the narrated thoughts which tend to drag a little. Having said that this is the pilgrim story of the American excuse - or English excuse for transporting the desperation and greed of the old world to the new.Pocahontas is a classic legend based on true history, this film is a beautiful interpretation (although you should always consider the propaganda aspect). If you are into history you have to respect the efforts made here. It shows the old world as the corrupt but hopeful thing it was and also reflects on the corruption of the new world by that invasion.There is definitely something tragic about the whole thing 'Don't trust me' says Captain Smith and if you study history you say yeah right! On the whole it is an extremely well made film dealing with the American (Americ - guy from Wales) thanksgiving bullshit but adding the true indigestion that follows.A must see for historians and those that can suffer such bitter lessons of history. But if you are looking for shallow entertainment this may be to rich.",7,0,0,30 June 2011
