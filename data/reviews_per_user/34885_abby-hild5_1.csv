Hereditary," A must see for horror fanatics
","The first time I saw hereditary I felt myself experience so many emotions so vividly that I felt like I had to pause it and take a break (in a good way). This movie is not for people looking for a quick jump scare, it gets you invested and makes you wait with tension to see the characters develop and the plot unravel. Slow burn type horror movies have always been my favorite and Hereditary doesn't disappoint. It mixes the suspense of a psychological thriller and elements of demonic horror and gore to create something that will leave you breathless. In the scene when Charlie dies, I felt my heart stop and I had to take a minute to myself. The way the story went from slow motion to the fast paced morbid death of a character takes the audience by surprise. The acting was amazing and I got chills when the mother began screaming after witnessing her daughters body. The ending scene with the eerie loud music and demonic imagery gives the horror fans what they desire and leaves you feeling unsettled. The movie does not treat you like you're dumb, it includes details that you'll have to pay attention to notice and tie the plot together.",10,1,4,21 April 2019
