The Blair Witch Project," Review and Possible Goof in the Blair Witch Project?
","I am glad to finally see a horror movie come along that's actually scary. It doesn't seem like much to ask of a horror movie, but it's certainly not something that any degree of multi-million dollar budget CGI effects can seem to deliver. When I was a child, the scariest movies, to me, were the ones that my parents wouldn't let me finish. Where what the television screen could show me left off, my creative mind took over, in the darkness of my bedroom. As the Blair Witch Project demonstrates with such chilling results, it's often what you can't see, what you don't know that scares you. I applaud the creators of this film for taking me back to those long nights in my dark bedroom for just a little while. Now, something for the 'Goofs' section- maybe, I'm not sure. This movie was supposed to take place in October, and in Maryland- I'm not sure when it was filmed, but it looked like fall, and I read in an interview w/the lead actress that they slept through 35-degree nights. How is it then, that you hear a cicada's call during one of the scenes? On the east coast, everywhere north of the Virginia's, cicada's are all gone by early to mid September. I don't know. It's probably nothing.",10,1,2,17 July 1999
