The Blair Witch Project," The worst movie with the best hype.
","I just saw this movie, and I was so thoroughly disappointed. Even if I suspend my disbelief, I can not forgive the blatant plot holes and inconsistencies that stick out throughout the entire film like sore thumbs. I must admit that I had a chuckle at the thought that someone decided to kick a piece of paper but do not expect me to blithely swallow the idea that this girl is any type of researcher.  The entire premise of the movie is that three 'researcher' are looking into the legendary Blair Witch, however time and time again, these 'researchers' simply ignore all of the hints and out-and-out revelations that the locals make about the Blair Witch.In two different instances, the first by Mary Brown the other by the two Fly fishermen, about the cabin in the woods. Imagine my surprise when at the end Heather and Mike find a cabin in the woods. Oooooooooh, how eerie.Earlier in the film, while Heather is in the cemetery, she speculates if the Blair Witch is responsible for the disappearance of the seven children in the 1940's. Even after the fishermen tell her about what really happened to the children, after they tell her about the cabin where their bodies were found, Heather and the team do NOTHING. This was so frustrating. What type of research is this?Okay, one last irritating bit, back to the fishermen, the manic that killed the children, kidnapped them in PAIRS, so why were only SEVEN children killed? Maybe the whole concept of the 'pair' is different in Maryland, but I don't thank so.I was expecting so much more, this movie was the biggest waste of $9.00 I have ever spent.  This movie was a monumental waste of my time.If anyone ever doubted the infinite power of the hype machine, this movie is evidence that it is alive and well in Hollywood. Emperor's New Clothes? Blair Witch? Apparently lightning does stick twice.  Save your money, burn it, bury it in a pit, spit on it instead, whatever you do-do not waste it on Blair Witch.",1,1,2,10 August 1999
The Game," Been here--Seen this
","I guess the first movie THE ONE GAME wasn't enough, someone had to go and re-make it. Only their version was cr*p. If you enjoyed this movie, you will really enjoy THE ONE GAME. The only difference is that T.O.G. isn't slow, it is fast paced and extremely suspenseful, also T.O.G. doesn't insult your intelligence at the end with a two-bit mammy-made tacked on ending.",1,18,32,8 January 1999
