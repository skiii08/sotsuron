Blade Runner 2049," Watch the original (1982)
","Good visual, music and ambiance, but nothing revolutionary in it. In general, a shallow attempt to replicate the original by reshuffling its elements and putting them into a clich√© blockbuster frame. Adds no new meaning, except explaining what happened in the old movie (for those of us who did not get it i guess).Acting is average, dialogues are shallow and meaningless towards the end, long pauses are a torture. Seems they are trying to stretch the screen time. A lot of evident product placement.",3,39,81,9 October 2017
