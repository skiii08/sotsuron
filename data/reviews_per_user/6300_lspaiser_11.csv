3:10 to Yuma," Totally put off by bad screenplay and Russel Crowe's failure to be a convincing cowboy
","Impressions of 3:10 To Yuma (2007)I know I saw a Russel Crowe movie. I am not sure saw a Western.At no time did Mr. Crowe make me believe he was a western cowboy. His accent was not at all suitable for the role and so to me he was Russel Crowe - the perfect captain in 'Captain And Commander.' Also the plot was confused by many 'oopses.' The whole movie is an OOPS.The screenplay was replete with errors and preposterous scenes. Like gut shot men back on their horse the same day, and, well, not to give it away, but the really preposterous ending. The whole plot/sreenplay has little credibility if you think about how much shooting there is, who gets shot and who does not and when and why.Only ++s are for cinematography and sound quality.Maybe Mr. Crowe, one of my favorite current actors just wanted to be in an American 'Western' like he saw Unforgiven and said 'I gotta do one of those.' Or more likely the offer to play Ben Wade in this old classic remake was too lucrative to turn down.I have no idea why Crowe made this movie.",2,5,9,19 February 2008
Fargo," This is a stupid movie about a stupid caper in which there are no redeeming qualities .
","Fargo is a movie with little merit as drama and little other reason to watch it save one - raw random violence. If that turns you on, and it must have turned on a lot of people to get the rating it did from so many people, then its for you. Otherwise don't waste your time. While Fargo is the true story of what happens when some sick minds get together and do the wrong thing, there is nothing particularly new about this theme in true life or fiction.  And while Alfred Hichcock might have made a masterpiece of this story, Mr. Cohen, in his flat pan 'cinema vérité ' style makes it one hell of a bore. Jerry Lungard (William Macy) plays an emotionless jerk that is in trouble and dreams up a dumb plot to try to get himself out of it. He convinces me that the real life Jerry Lungard was as boring an idiot as the movie character. He plays the part so well he is absolutely dull. (But then - it is vérité !). Pregnant police chief investigator Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) plays a like character but with more style. Flat pan and in a plain Minnesota folk type Luddite brogue (`ja - dats the way is' - except sometimes I think I hear a Brooklyn / Illinois accent sneak tru), she stumbles around and finally comes upon the murderer(s). I use the tenuous plural since one of them (I can tell you this 'cause its right on the video jacket) - is mainly (very red) mulch because he's mostly been fed through a wood chopper! 
This is a stupid movie about a stupid caper in which there are no redeeming qualities (in the movie, that is).Siskel - Ebert - what in the world did were those guys thinking giving it two thumbs up? So go for it if you love watching cold people commit a lot of cold blooded murder. (Was this movie made for TV?) Ugh. As Garrison Keillor might say, 'and that's the news from the lake this week.' Now if Garrison had written this movie it might be interesting (Cinema vérité noir á la Keillor).",3,5,14,9 March 2001
"Good Morning, Vietnam"," A 'must see' movie about the tragedy of our war in Indochina
","Possibly Robin Williams' most brilliant movie, the comedic character (Adrian Cronauer) is perfectly cast in Williams. But in this movie we see the true meaning of tragi-comedy. This is no laughing movie. I truly wept more than I thought of laughing.In this would be funny movie, we see a heartfelt and sometimes horrific glimpse of what was really going on over there, and in fact, what happened to anyone who might have wanted to tell this to the rest of the world.
This is not a minor film and is a 'must see' movie about our tragedy in Indochina.",9,1,1,25 January 2001
Before Sunset," As with the characters there is profoundness, as well as simplicity.
","You really can't rate Before Sunset properly without including Before Sunrise.Before Sunrise is actually the first part of a two part set, the second part being Before Sunset. I thought that movie might be a sequel, as sequels go. It is not. It is the other essential part of the whole. I will critique them as an essential pair.The movies are difficult to rate. This is because if they mean something to you they should mean a lot. If they do not mean anything in particular, then you probably didn't like them at all - and probably didn't bother with the sequel. Without going into any details (I don't need to - you can get the official storyline from the general critic's reviews), here is how I rate them.Before seeing Before Sunset, I gave Before Sunrise a 3 out of 4. But the two together rate a 4, or more precisely an 8.5 out of 10. I have to leave room for such masterpieces as Hotel Rwanda and films in that class - totally different. It is also interesting that these movies are played out in real time. But I won't elaborate in order not to spoil the plot of the movies as a pair. We are lucky that as of now, we can see them together, or even better, one night apart, as I did.As with the characters there is profoundness, as well as simplicity to these movies and a nagging question which is resolved at the end (of Sunset).What do you think?

Life Is Beautiful," Far less than I expected
","In spite of its 'message' about the human spirit I did not feel this movie worked. I'm sorry to rebuff those who thought it was great including my favorite movie critic but I don't think the 'message' in a movie make it rise above its trappings. If it doesn't look real to me it fails as a movie no matter how lofty it's message.I didn't like it and here is why: This movie tries to be a lot of things it is not. At first it felt like Fellini – crazy Italians! But it is not.Then it tries to be Phillie de Broca in 'King of Hearts.' But it is not.And don't forget 'Captain Corelli's Mandolin.' which is about Italians during the war but takes place in Greece and is apparently a true story.High ratings for all of the above – but alas not 'Life is Beautiful.' It's a sad story but the whole thing feels like a stage set which it is. Especially the prison camp which is too small and clean to be what it represents.If you want to see a dark comedy about Nazis watch 'King of Hearts' again. At least it is funny.Or, if you want to get the message watch 'Captain Corelli's Mandolin.' After all, this is not a stage play; it is cinema, in a world where 'Avatar' will win Academy Awards this year.This movie also has all the hallmarks of a soap opera.Who dies and who lives and why 'and guess who shows up at the end' is one for the classic soaps.",2,8,19,11 February 2010
Shine," Not just a picture, Shine is an experience.
",Just a wonderful movie. Geoffrey Rush is wonderful. Certainly a 'Best Actor of the year.' You must see this movie if you love life.,9,0,0,19 August 2001
The Godfather: Part III," As a whole - The Godfather trilogy is a lot like an Italian opera - one that should tear at your heart.
","First of all these movies span a period of almost 20 years between the first and the last. Too bad they were not all produced as a series (in close order). Unfortunately I saw Godfather (1) a week ago but did view all three DVDs of II and III together today. It is a saga - like Gabriel Garcia Marquez' '100 Years of Solitude' - a story spanning several lifetimes.Probably the most powerful images are those of the leading characters (which is almost an oxymoron)who play roles that are easily characterized as stunning. But especially Pachino, who is truly frightening but pathetic at the same time.The movies themselves are gripping. I thought part III was the jewel, to which the entire three movies (less the first - more the 2nd) - was building up to. The finale was classic and I'm sure any serious opera lovers will agree, very much a classic 'Italian Opera.' It is no coincidence that that finale takes place, in fact, at the opera - of course an Italian opera.Glad I managed to see them all within a short time span.Again - Bravo - (especially to Pachino).LHS",10,0,2,15 October 2004
Downfall," Cinematic ally 'Downfall' is a non-event
","I found 'Downfall' boring and too long. Compared to Hotel Rwanda which was thrilling and chilling, 'Downfall' was neither - it was a trivial movie. Don't waste your time and money unless you really want to get the exact 'who did what and how' at the end of the Reich.But if you like historical tales, and you like to see 'polite' blood and a bit of guts - this movie is for you.The movie, like its infamous villain states about himself  has no feeling. Indeed it portrays nothing in particular about this horrific person. Other, than probably like in his personal life, he must have been quite boring.I guess it could rate somewhat higher if it was a documentary, but it can't even qualify as that. Cinematic ally 'Downfall' is a non-event",5,4,42,6 April 2005
Platoon," This film is an average grade B war movie with a good moralistic message but without much depth.
","Platoon did not impress me as a particularly good movie but neither was it a bad movie. On this basis I would rate it 5 out of 10. While it probably depicted the gross nastiness of that awful war pretty accurately in a technical sense, Platoon never transcends itself into a sense of reality. I was always aware I was watching a movie; it never got beyond the screen to become an experience I got drawn in to.The same goes for the production itself. While it had special effects galore, to me the action was just a lot of those expensive but not convincing effects. Again, the would-be horrific scenes never transcended the screen and gripped me. I was always quite aware that I was watching a movie production.On the plus side the character development of several of key players was very interesting and probably the one high point of this movie. The interplay, the breaking under ultimate stress, etc, were all situations well portrayed. (For this reason I raised my vote from 5 to 6 out of 10.)As for the acting, I did not think there was anything outstanding about anyone's performance; everyone was OK.As for the theme, to me the whole movie was like a sick orgy. And while this may have been what it is supposed to have portrayed, once again, it never convinced me it was not just a bunch of actors, putting on a very well staged sick orgy in front of a camera. This all impressed me but it did not move me.This film is an average grade B war movie with a good moralistic message but without much depth. It should appeal to people who like to watch bloody looking action-packed movies - and perhaps analyze the character portrayals, without risking getting too upset.",6,2,5,3 February 2001

Gladiator," A very good movie - in spite of its grand spectacle style
","Gladiator is 2 1/2 hours long and I watched it in two parts. I agree completely with 'gregatory' (another reviewer - see that review) in most respects.Russel Crowe is clearly one of the greatest actors alive today. His role here is nothing short of that. Also the description of the almost impossibly gory battle scene in the beginning (as well as the gladiator scenes later), could be trivial blood and gore performances. But they are not. It is clear how brutal these things were, but the craft the the producers use to portray them makes them sensible and tolerable. What we see is the horror of war - even before anybody had a gun or cannon or bomb.Frankly, I was put off by the performance of Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus. He played a despicable and weak, palsied man so well it seemed his acting was equally bad. It annoyed me and I almost panned the movie for that. But I believe that was a personal bias. Apparently the role was just that - awful, the man was awful, that is.The second part (for me) fit together with the plot and was quite credible. Still the movie lacked something to make it absolutely great. It was also somewhat predictable - not an ingenious plot.So I rate it as very very good (8 points) but not great. As I mentioned though, Russel Crowe is great. I think, like Clint Eastwood, he is typecasting himself. His role and performance does remind me of Capt. Jack Aubrey in Master and Commander.He is definitely the Commander.",8,1,2,25 August 2005
