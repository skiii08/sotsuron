Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Terrific film and will be a comedy classic
","One of the funniest and most engaging movies I have ever seen. I wouldn't have posted anything if I hadn't seen the recent slew of negative reviews this movie got and the ridiculous amount of hateful, disagreeable people agreeing with the reviews. 'Borat' is a daring comedic achievement. It is just, simply, comedic brilliance, genius, but, most of all, guts. Sacha Baron Cohen put life and limb (forget reputation, that was the least of his worries) on the line to put this madness together and it works beautifully. True, Cohen may have mislead some unsuspecting people into his comic mayhem, but, historically, that is the gist of comedy: 'candid camera' anyone? Borat is raw and funny and an honest look at not just America, but people in general, and the social dynamics that shape their behavior and their lives. The range and layers of Cohen's humor is extraordinary. He is capable of physical comedy, spontaneous wit, and humorous social commentary all in one fell swoop. Amazing. I recommend 'Borat' whole-heartedly and object to the 'haters' who are either too dense or too mentally disturbed to appreciate this film.",8,2,48,7 June 2007
Resident Evil: Extinction," Wow. RE:E was actually watchable...!
","RE:E is entertaining and quirky in the spirit of the first Resident Evil. Having been psychologically scarred for life by 'Ultraviolet,' I for one was all too wary of placing credence on Milla's name alone as an indicator of a movie's quality. But, fortunately, RE:E comes through. It is decent. Hooray. I think what makes the Resident Evil franchise (the games and the films) successful in general is that it is inventive and interesting. While RE:2 may have had the largest budget of the series, it was bloated, plodding, and artistically threadbare. With RE:E, you have a more refined and engaging film experience without all the overpriced gimmicks. Yes, it could have been more, but, in terms of expectations and actual product, I felt RE:E was rather well done.",7,1,2,30 September 2007
28 Weeks Later," The movie failed... Sorry, hardcore fans.
","One of the best looking crappy movies I've ever seen. If only effects and masterful technique were enough. It's as if director Fresnadillo decided to forget about the plot and just go rampant with grit and artistry, which works if all we're seeing is an 11 minute film or a static wall-to-wall museum exhibit, but this is supposed to be a 90 minute film for god's sake. While the two children's desire to explore beyond the containment zone is understandable, the lack of perimeter watch-posts was totally illogical. The Army's lackadaisical response to the children going on their fit of wanderlust is thoroughly illogical. Here's the deepest cut: the children's mischief and disobedience directly contributes to the fall of the entire containment zone, AND YET, they're supposed to be the objects of sympathy throughout the film ?!? How does that make sense ?!? Conveniently, the Army doctor (Rose Byrne) couldn't put two and two together or simply overlooks that fact altogether: hello !!! In that respect, it was very difficult to root for and feel any sympathy for those sorry rascals. So now you have an implausible and illogical chain of events and characters you can't possibly sympathize with because they are so inconceivably dense. All the pyrotechnics and hyper-stylized shots won't rescue you from that... Or can they? Well, I guess it depends on who you ask. I, for one, found the plot lapses all too inane and simply unforgivable. '28 Weeks Later' begins magnificently, then rots.",6,1,6,15 May 2007
The Dark Knight," my hypothesis on the high rating of 'Dark Knight'
","I'm putting 'Dark Knight' in the 7.8 - 8.5 range, so certainly it is well within the IMDb top 250, meaning, it is a good movie.But is it worthy of number one? Certainly there are objective and subjective components to this analysis! Well, certainly, 'Dark Knight' is a film of mesmerizing scenes and performances.I felt the first quarter of the film was quite literally, spellbinding... The Joker's quite cavalier dispatching of all his partners in crime during the opening bank heist is iconic and will be legendary. It was darkly humorous, enthralling and vaguely satisfying on a primal level how Heath Ledger's Joker is able to so ably, so deftly, and so cavalierly implement chaos to his personal benefit.Everything clicked more or less up until Lao was apprehended by Batman in one of the most unique and superbly imagined action sequences I've ever seen on film.And then the movie sort of winded down for me. Or maybe I winded down. Or maybe a little bit of both. I'm not sure.But on to the rather strange question: why is 'Dark Knight' number one? Humor me for a moment! Well, the editing certainly doesn't help its cause... But then the producers and filmmakers would say, 'Well, that's how we intended it: sharp, concise, and we believed the audience could draw their own conclusions without being spoon-fed the story-- yaddah yaddah yaddah...' Okay, okay. I'll dismiss that then. I won't go too deep into the mechanics of the film, which I felt needed more fluidity, but, well, I suppose that's more a matter of personal taste. Some people just like more set-up, more build-up, more details, and I suppose I'm one of those people.But, 'Dark Knight' is number one on the IMDb listing, for the time being at least, because, mainly, Batman's time in the limelight and social consciousness has truly arrived. Furthermore, 'Dark Knight' may very well be the quintessential Batman movie, with every prop, every idea, every actor, every special effect, every brooding sentiment, in place and thoroughly engaged to create the epic maelstrom that is this film. In short, Christopher Nolan's directorial handling of the Batman series is 'Batman' revisited and 'Batman' evolving into its powerful potential as an epic saga, and not just a weekly or monthly comic. The deep philosophical and moral issues which the Batman story brings to the fore has always deserved a treatment on film. And director Christopher Nolan has done just that with 'Dark Knight.' And he has done it well, or at least well enough...I credit, also, Frank Miller for giving the 'Dark Knight' its soul. His groundbreaking graphic novel in the 1990's about a Batman for the modern era without the hokey prime-time TV kitsch and parody, set the stage for this ultimate and haunting vision of Batman as he was supposed to be, as he was meant to be...So finally, I would say, 'Dark Knight' is what 'Batman' should have been all along and why it's getting the acclaim and attention it's getting, deservedly or not: it is haunting. It is frightening. It is fantastical. It is plausible, especially in our current day and age of twisted, demented, deluded madmen and principled, driven super-soldiers.While 'Batman' is a DC comic about a crime-fighter, 'Dark Knight' is a movie about 'the fight,' the ultimate fight, one which we all must ultimately wage at some level, played out in the backdrop of a sprawling, brutal and relentless metropolis and in the staggering vacuum of an amoral human world.In 'Batman Begins,' the character Bruce Wayne seeks to create a symbol out of his crime-fighting alter ego, to last through the ages, to impart a sense of perpetuity so that evil-doers and revelers in chaos will take pause and so that stricken masses will feel hope and capacity in the face of dire circumstance. It's quite messianic, actually, if you think about it...And 'Dark Knight' continues in that same vein, with Bruce Wayne sacrificing the reputation of Batman for the sake of the greater good, for the sake of hope, for the sake of the people, because, as Jim Gordon puts it, 'he can take it,' because he is the 'protector...'I welcome and relish the envisioning of the Batman story in capable and committed hands.This envisioning by Christopher Nolan, I felt, needed some fluidity and polish, but Nolan takes 'Batman,' with the gift of Christian Bale in the lead, where it ultimately needed to go, into the realm of legend and allegory and symbol.",8,1,3,26 July 2008
