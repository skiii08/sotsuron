First Man," Where we learn that Neil Armstrong was horrible human
","Boring! No reason to root for Armstrong. He was an emotionless, horrible husband, father and associate. All this while accompanied by a soundtrack that switches between annoyingly distracting and LaLa Land. Oh, and take a motion sickness pill before going since the camera is never still and constantly in extreme tight close-ups on faces. What a mess.",1,68,123,13 October 2018
