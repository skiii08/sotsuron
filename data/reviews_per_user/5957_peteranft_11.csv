Ford v Ferrari," One of 2019 Best Pictures
","Entertaining from beginning to end with a bit of a surprise at the end. The story line seemed very real and while I'm sure they embellished in spots, it provides a view into the history of car manufacturing and that race to be the best and the fastest on the planet.",10,3,6,17 December 2019
Rocketman," Swing and a foul tip ....
","Not a total miss, some good music, but the focus is on his down and out lifestyle.... could it have been that terrible? I wonder if a movie can focus on the goodness of life and be successful? Maybe not... people want to see a train wreck. They got one here.",5,2,3,4 July 2019
A Star Is Born," Deserving of a mini-series
","Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga both provide surprisingly good performances. I'm a cryer and 'yes', I cried. I wanted this couple to work so badly, they brought out the best in each other. So, even though the ending was predetermined, it made me sad and as I wished for love to win out. Two stars knocked it from perfect because it was deserving of more time.The Dice-man was impressive and should continue to act. A real talent.",8,1,2,20 October 2018
Us," Not terrible but too long
","I thought the humor helped, especially Dad. I was on the wrong path initially, thinking the clones were manufactured somehow by the house of mirrors. But, then I got a feeling that something happened to that girl when she bumped into her twin. So, the ending was not a huge surprise for me. Biggest question unanswered??? Why was the boys clone burned?",7,1,1,31 March 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," Critics are wrong, this is an Oscar candidate.
","Rami Malik and the cast were fantastic in this epic band tribute and telling of the often sad life of Freddie Mercury. Seeking love of family and friends is a desire of all, including the rich and famous. I loved every minute, learned much about the band and Freddie Mercury while rocking out to this classic and totally unique rock band. My favorite film of 2018.",10,11,19,4 November 2018
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Action packed, lots of Spidy action
","I enjoyed this movie for what it was... Spider-Man action. The story kept my interest, the graphics were very well done, the ending was satisfying.... this movie delivered what's most important... good, fun, entertainment!",7,1,5,19 January 2019
Yesterday," Thank you for not being political...
","A fun and creative tribute to the Beatles. This movie was very enjoyable and I give this high applause! Well done! The producers could have made political statements or had a political message underneath, they chose not to. Thank you!",9,2,6,6 July 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Wow!
",Reminded me of the Seinfeld finale when every character shows up.... same here. It was amazing but I also thought it was just too over done.,5,4,10,12 May 2019
Toy Story 4," This should have been a ten....
","I love Woods and the gang and found Toy Story 1, 2, and 3 to set the standard for modern animated pictures. This was really good but lacked the maturity of the others. Disney makes magic... their best films speak to children, teens, millennials, adults, grand parents, etc.... it's amazing. Toy Story 4 spoke more to kids, less to those older. Thus, not a ten.",7,0,4,4 July 2019
The Lion King," Wonderful!
","Wonderful movie with breathtaking reality. How did they train those animals to act, sing, and dance! Seriously, amazing movie.... critical reviews are strange to me, people don't like that this movie replicates the cartoon... what did they expect? I saw the Broadway play and spoiler alert.... Simba became King. Of course we know the story!!!!!!!!!Beyonce is fantastic, she is the star!Note: 3D was ok but not required. See it in 3D if you enjoy wearing the glasses.",8,3,12,21 July 2019
Green Book," Pulls you in....
","Beautifully shot film pulled me away from today and back into the 60's. Loved the acting, Mortenson and Ali were wonderful. The story is honest while being entertaining. The issues of such a trip in the 60's are well depicted while the resulting friendship demonstrates the power of love over superficial worldly expectations. Big thumbs up.",10,2,6,1 December 2018
