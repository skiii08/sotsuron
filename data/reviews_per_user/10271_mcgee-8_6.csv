Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A mixed bag
","Yes, the character of Jar Jar was botched.  True, Jake Lloyd's acting left something to be desired.  Sure, the movie lacked the flair and drama of the original trilogy.  And definitely, the film sorely missed what Harrison Ford brought to Episodes 4-6, a dose of down-to-earth humor and grit.Yet I can't quite call this movie unwatchable.  It is a visual treat throughout, particularly during the Pod Race and climactic sword battle. And I thought that Neeson, McGregor and Portman all gave fine performances, especially since they didn't have the best script to work with.  (Also, it was nice to see Frank Oz do Yoda again, as only he can.)Perhaps this movie will have an effect not unlike that of the critically panned 'Star Trek: The Motion Picture,' which resulted in a better second film.  Perhaps Lucas and Co. will rebound with a livelier flick, closer in quality to 'A New Hope,'  'The Empire Strikes Back' and 'Return Of The Jedi.' With the news that Jar Jar will return for Episode 2, I can't say I'm too optimistic.  But with the right Anakin, it could be done.",Null,0,1,17 January 2000
Man on the Moon," Moon on the Man?
","In a way, Carrey-as-Kaufman's opening objections to the movie ring truer than the filmmakers probably intended.  The film is, as many here have noted, a mostly shallow biography.  It is saved only somewhat by a terrific impersonation and a fascinating subject.I'm not a Johnny-come-lately to either the Kaufman or Carrey bandwagons.  I dug Andy from his SNL appearances on -- always saw the genius subtext of every ballsy bit he tried, even the 'controversial' wrestling stuff.  And I liked Carrey from 'In Living Color' on...in addition to becoming a fine actor, he has become perhaps the most talented physical comedian since Buster Keaton.  It's fitting that they both have the same birthday...this is truly a match made in comedy heaven.So for that reason, and almost that reason alone, the movie is worth seeing at least once.  But man, what a botched attempt at a great film!   We get overly simplified transitions between Kaufman bits, a woefully slight treatment of Kaufman's developing years (Why TM?  Why Zmuda?  Why the 'performance art' approach?), and a sloppy approach to the details of Kaufman's life (for example, no mention that he did 'Van Dyke & Company' before 'Taxi'; that Dick Ebersol, not Lorne Michaels, produced SNL when Kaufman was fired from the show...and where was Elayne Boosler, a close pal and former girlfriend of Andy's?  Her presence was acknowledged not at all.)It's almost a shame to waste a great performance like Carrey's on a movie this compromised and lame (it does look as if it were brutally edited.) Someday, I hope, another fine actor will take on portraying Andy, and be supported by a director, writer and producer more committed to providing insight about Kaufman the man.",8,0,0,9 January 2000
Toy Story 2," More from a Golden Age
","With top-notch work from Pixar, Disney, the Simpsons and South Park production teams, Mike Judge and others, the 1990s were the best decade for animation since the 1950s, and maybe the best ever.  And 'Toy Story 2' continued that hot streak, with  outstanding technical work, a clever and thought-provoking story, and an Oscar-worthy score by Randy Newman.Technically, TS-2 aims higher than the original, and succeeds brilliantly. Yet I slightly prefer TS-1, because I favor the relatively simple charm of TS-1's plot to the more helter-skelter vibe I got from TS-2.  (Also, as a sequel it lacked the inspired originality of TS-1.)  That said, I did one part of TS-2's script that eclipsed TS-1's.",9,0,1,14 December 1999
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," A nice surprise, a memorable film
","When I heard that Chris Columbus was directing the first Harry Potter movie, I had my doubts.  But 'The Sorcerer's Stone' turned out to be splendid -- as Ron would say, wicked. Looked good, good story, generally acted well. I was thinking as I took it in, this may be the Star Wars for my kids' generation.
The child actors, perhaps expertly coaxed by Columbus, all turned in good performances, particularly Rupert Grint as Ron.  Emma Watson did overemote as Hermoine, but because her character's also a ham, and because the girl is so darn cute, I could cut her some slack this time. As for the adults, I'm thinking that at the least, Robbie Coltrane deserves a supporting actor Oscar nom.  The movie was well-cast, especially with J.K. Rowling's personal choice for Snape, Alan Rickman. A couple of nit-picks: the Quidditch field (pitch?) looked rather phony from the sky, like it was in a Harry Potter video game. And I'm not sure I would've detected this had I not seen the NBC interview with Daniel Radcliffe, but in more than half the scenes, you can tell if you look close that there's no lenses in Harry's glasses.",Null,0,0,11 December 2001
Hercules," Disney's spin on the Greek legends
","My 3-year-old son's seen 'Hercules' more than a hundred times, so I've got this one pretty much memorized.  It is a clever, lively film.  Cheesy in spots, but few Disney films aren't.  Fine animation, as per usual from Disney.  In the post-'Little Mermaid' pantheon, I'd put it ahead of Hunchback and (barely) ahead of Mulan and Aladdin.  But behind Lion King, Little Mermaid, Pocahontas and Beauty and The Beast.  (I haven't seen Tarzan yet, so I'm not sure how it compares with that.)",8,0,2,24 October 1999
Jaws," Still Spielberg's best
","I think 'Jaws,' after all these years, remains Steven Spielberg's best film (outdistancing his second-best, 'Raiders Of The Lost Ark.')  And it's my all-time personal favorite movie.  While you'd likely not find it on many critics' best-of lists for the 20th Century, it's the most fully entertaining film I've ever seen -- a classic mix of drama, plot and characterization.I believe Spielberg was quoted as saying he was disappointed that the shark scenes near the chief's boat looked less than authentic.  And while it's true the shark that attacks the boat looks more mechanical than real, it's only in the film for a relatively short time, and does not distract from the overall brilliance of the movie.An expert buildup to the shark attacks, a sense of chaos and fear that never feels phony, a fine (and underrated) collection of acting performances, a terrific score by John Williams, and refreshing moments of comic relief to ease the tension.  All this and more make 'Jaws' one of the great Hollywood films.I especially like the acting chemistry between Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss when the three are trying to hunt down the shark that's been terrorizing their beach-vacation town.  Also, I found Shaw's character's tale about shark attacks on survivors of his sunken WWII boat to be a memorable piece of acting.Spielberg aimed for higher meaning with films like 'Schindler's List' and 'Saving Private Ryan,' and he made more money with 'E.T.' and 'Jurassic Park,' but I maintain that 'Jaws' is Spielberg at his best, doing what he does best: solid storytelling and characterization, memorable and gripping plotlines, and first-rate entertainment that pushes all the right buttons.",Null,0,1,22 April 2000
