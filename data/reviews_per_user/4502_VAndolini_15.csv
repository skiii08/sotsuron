Scarface," Sorry boys, DePalma thinks you are all lame
","There is one reviewer here who asks 'Is there something wrong with me because i did not like this film at all?' No, in my opinion, you are a very intelligent man who knows garbage when he sees it. DePalma, the director, has said numerous times that it absolutely appalls him that some people love this film because the main character is ' badass'. Tip: if you want someone to not take you seriously and conclude you are a brain damaged ten year old boy, then by all means say badass. DePalma said many times he made this film to show the futility of violence and complete emptiness that type of will lead you to. I laugh at all these little boys here totally misreading the film and director's intention. Pacino has also expressed his great displeasure at so many fanboys thinking that is a cool way to live. Sorry guys, you are all lame",4,0,3,25 August 2018
Requiem for a Dream," Real, raw, and a descent into addiction hell
","I do not know what to say. As one who knows addiction, let me say, even with Aronofsy's flair for bizarre, that this film is the most realistic portrayal about the hell of addiction in film history. Someone here said it is like a modern day Reefer Madness, but that reviewer sounds like a person who kills kittens for fun. No, it is not that stupid film. It is an ALLEGORY for the devastation of addiction. That means, even with the director's unusual way of filming, that watching this film is akin to watching addiction personified. Over the top? Sure, but that is addiction. Weird and dark? Yep, addiction. Lastly, let me say that legend Ellen Burstyn gives her best performance in her heartbreaking portrayal of addiction of the elderly. Good God, how the heck did that moron Julia Roberts win the Oscar over Ellen's work? You need a strong stomach for this film, but that is addiction. Period.",10,1,1,8 September 2018
Oldboy," Absolutely devastating
","I do not know what to say about this film that has not already been said. Oldboy is original, stunning, sickening, surprising and totally unforgettable. Well acted and directed, and the ending is bar none one of the most devastating twists in film history. I will not spoil it here, a must see film.",10,0,1,1 December 2018
Brokeback Mountain," A study of love. Period.
","This film is one of very few films that made me think, reflect and ponder for years after seeing it. Other reviews hit all the right notes: gay cowboy movie, two men who love each other, forbidden love, etc. For me, this film is simply a perfect study of love. I never thought of the two amazing leads as anything other than two human beings who love each other very much, but are forbidden to be together. It hurt my heart. It made me think. A beautiful film.",10,5,6,25 August 2018
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Timeless black comedy
","Many reviews here say they do not like this film because it is full of caricatures, not real people. THAT IS THE POINT. My God, people here who hate this film cannot form a coherent argument as to why they hate it. One even compared it to Napoleon Dynamite. It was at that point I lost all hope for humanity, gouged out my eyeballs with two forks, and set myself on fire. I am in Hell here.",10,4,5,8 September 2018
The Revenant," Stunning film = Leo deserved that Oscar
","An actor does not need to talk a lot to make a great film. Example: Sally Hawkins was amazing in The Shape of Water. Leo is equally stunning with little dialogue in this film. He acts the heck of of that role, his face, reactions, everything he does makes for my opinion that he really deserved the Oscar. So happy he won, and Alejandro Inarritu also deserved the Oscar for directing this film. Kudos all around",10,1,1,1 December 2018
Dallas Buyers Club," Made me a fan of Matthew
","I confess that before viewing this film, I though Matthew M. Was a one trick pony. Boy was I wrong. He is amazing in this film, such a full, finely tuned performance. Interesting that both Matthew and Leonardo were nominated the same year for Best Actor, and Matthew had a small role in Wolf. I absolutely love, love DiCaprio, I am a longtime fan. But no, Leo did not deserve Best Actor for the piece of overbaked garbage Wolf of Wall Street. Matthew's performance is so multilayered, so well acted and he owned the Oscar. My man Leo, well, no. However, Leo did deserve it for The Reverant, so I am happy he won for that film. See Matthew M. As never before,this film made me a fan. If three hours of nonstop sociopathy, cocaine snorting, jacking off like a twelve year old, see Wolf. I pity people who think Wolf is good.",10,1,2,6 December 2018
Twilight," Kill me now please
","I am a huge horror film fan. Huge. For some inexplicable reason, one Halloween there was nothing on to watch except this film. Jesus Christ. I barely made it through the whole thing. Vampires do not sparkle. I realize the great Bela Lugosi stared a lot as Dracula, but he had talent. His stares had intensity. All this freaking film had was stares being the catatonic Stewart, and glitterly Pattison. Nice lipstick edward, you looked ridiculous. As my prayers were finally answered and this film ended, I heard the distinct sound of Lugosi spinning in his grave. And Christopher Lee spinning in his grave. Max Schreck as Nosferatu spinning in his grave. I am sure if the great Gary Oldman were deceased he would be spinning in his grave at this insulting addition to vampire lore. And they made MORE? No thanks, I have to go set myself on fire. Good God.",1,3,4,20 September 2018
JFK," Stone plunged off the deep end
","I truly admire Oliver Stone gifted filmmaking, his service to our country, and insight into many issues. However, i believe he has simply lost his freaking mind with this movie. None of the portrayals represent the whole truth, because we do not know the truth. That is fine, whatever Oliver. But pandering to the lowest common denominator, i.e.,conspiracy theorists (I use that term loosely) that believe LBJ, the CIA, Castro and little green men from Mars were all behind the assassination. Costner's portrayal of Garrison 's emotion run the usual gamut from A to B. Would it kill the guy to maybe not look like he is always constipated? However, i took delight in the film's portrayal of that insane, evil, closet case J. Edgar Hoover. He looked positively ravishing in this film! So beautiful! Hoover, you entered the wrong profession - you could give RuPaul a run for his money!! sly old dog Hoover",4,0,4,22 July 2018
A Quiet Place," Very clever and tense film. But beware of the oh so obvious trolls here
","Before I review this film, a few things: some people here say the film is boring and stupid whilst misspelling words and employing incorrect grammar. And easy words are misspelled. A tip: if you want to be taken seriously, at least know how to spell before ranting about the supposed stupidity of this film. Pot meet kettle. Secondly, it it very obvious one brain addled ten year old is spamming this page with different user names. So obvious.Okay. This is a very clever and tense film, and it kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish. Talented actors, great atmosphere. Some people here also say 'why didn't they just...'? This a MOVIE. ENTERTAINMENT. The whywhywhy is ridiculous.",10,2,5,15 September 2018
2001: A Space Odyssey," I appreciate this film, it is important but GAWD
","Stanley, Stanley, Stanley. I love Kubrick. Strangelove is one of my fave films of all time. Paths of Glory was devastating. Clockwork Orange scarred me for life. I even appreciate Barry Lyndon not Ryan O'Neal, but I digress. 2001 IS important in film history, i firmly believe Star Wars would not exist if not for this film. But this film is so antiseptic. You have music, then ten minutes of darkness. Then primates come shrieking on the scene, throwing bones, killing pigs and screaming at the monolith, which seemed to like a chocolate bar on steroids. Then one throws a bone in the air and presto! It is a space vehicle. When the actual humans in the film speak, my sister said 'can you turn the volume up?' I did and it did not help. Everything happens so slowlyyyyyyyyyyyy in this film. In the end, HAL ended up as my favorite character, with the screaming primate coming in second place. Like I said, I APPRECIATE this movie, I LOVE Kubrick, but no one is perfect. 8 stars for its important place in history and Kubrick's sheer audacity. Cheers Stanley",8,2,3,9 September 2018
The Shape of Water," magical - and obviously the negative reviews here are from the same person
","Beautiful film, ruined only by the pathetic blathering of some troll here who has the intellectual capacity of a turnip. Del Toro creates a fantasy film, one with heart and soul. I have to wonder who this sad person is here that keeps vomiting the same review after review. As for this film being 'PC' it is not, and of you think it is, you have totally missed the point. Perhaps some White Power group allowed one of their goons to post quasi-political drivel against this film, but the film is still outstanding.",10,5,10,5 May 2018
The Godfather: Part III," Unfairly maligned, try not to compare it to the first two
","The Godfather 1and 2 are two of the best films ever made. Revolutionary in storytelling, truly epic, masterful performances. That said, I can understand why some people dislike the third film. It is very different, but is that bad? Not in this case. Now, three is not even close to capturing the magic of the first two. So try not to compare, and I think this film has many things going for it. Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, the wonderful Talia Shire, Eli Wallach, Andy Garcia, etc. Great performances, and the way the story unfolds against majestic and historical background. I thought the inclusion of the controversial death of Pope John Paul I was fascinating and very well done. The opera at the end was also really well done, and the person who actually dies was quite shocking at the time. I was very surprised. Okay. Sofia Coppolla was not good, but was not that bad. For the record, she said she hated acting and did not want the part, but did it for her dad. Good to see now that Sofia has really found her niche in directing. All in all, a good film, judged unfairly.",8,0,1,23 November 2018
The Wolf of Wall Street," Enough Martin, enough already
","I love Martin Scorcese. I am also Italian, so i feel simpatico of sorts with the man. But Jesus Christ, can he make a film not about excess, alpha males or the mafia? This film has no mob, but it has sex, drugs, and midget bowling. For three freaking hours. Good God, the last thing I want from a film is the sight of the supremely overrated Jonah Hill jacking off. I do not need to see that, no one does outside of a torture chamber. You know who loves this film? Fifteen year old teenagers. I know many because of teaching, and they think this movie is cool. So, congrats Martin you have made a film the glorifies Wall Street, excess and law breaking. As usual. Guys who love this film: congrats to you also, because not matter how old you are, you are on the same level as addled brained fifteen year olds. Maybe Martin should have involved the mob, button men have more charm than these idiots in this film.",6,3,4,3 December 2018
300," Good God, this film is mind numbingly awful
","I can handle films that do not accurately portray real events. I cannot handle films that take said events and insult the viewer with idiotic parodies and stupid generalizations. I like Gerard Butler, but all he does is scream. And scream some more. And for a change, shriek more. Do not even get me started on the horrific portrayal of Xerxes. Really? Really?? At that point in the film I felt like gouging my eyeballs out with forks and stomping on them. What a ridiculous film. Goat head guy?? No, just no. A film for brain addled ten year olds. And lastly, why does everything happen so slowwwwwwly?? God.",3,3,11,2 October 2018
