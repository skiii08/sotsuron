The Ring," The most psychologically terrifying movie I've ever seen
","This movie scared the bujeezus out of me. That's saying a lot for someone like me, who has been watching horror movies since childhood. A lot of people may be disappointed that there is so little gore, but honestly, that is the very reason this movie is so great. This movie utilizes suspense and fear of the unknown in a way that I've never seen before. The basis of the story goes as follows: A teenage girl is found dead, huddled in her closet. The friend who was with her that night is sent to a mental health facility. No one can explain what happened to either of the girls, so the grieving mother asks her sister Rachel, a reporter, to investigate for some answers. Rachel slowly pieces together the last few days of the dead girl's life and discovers that she and her friends all watched a mysterious videotape. She finds the tape and watches it herself. The video makes little sense and is mostly a series of frightening imagery and curious music. Immediately after she is finished watching, the phone rings. The voice on the other end whispers, 'Seven days.' For the next seven days, Rachel is subject to horrifying visions and physical anomalies, all while trying to uncover the truth behind 'the videotape that kills you when you watch it'. It's a race against time to save herself and her young son from a mysterious yet certain death. The film utilizes suspense to frighten the audience. It's not immediately clear exactly what fate awaits those who've watched the tape, aside from the fact that after seven days, you will die. Visually, the movie uses subtle colors, causing the foreboding mood to nearly swallow the viewers whole. Imagery from the cursed video is reiterated throughout the movie in sometimes subtle, other times obvious ways. Fear of the unknown is the movie's weapon of choice. Gore is nearly non-existent; one of the images in the cursed video depicts a fingernail being torn from it's base, but it is shown in black and white and for less than a second. The only other time blood is used to terrify happens when a horse falls from a barge and is sucked into the spinning blades of the engine. Even this is not all that hard to watch, as all you can see is the water behind the vessel turning crimson a few moments after the horse goes under. If you are tired of the same old Texas Chainsaw Massacres and Cabin Feveresque movies, check out The Ring. Psychological terror is far more disturbing than any limb-ripping bloodfest could be. You won't be able to sleep tonight.",9,1,2,27 October 2006
Silent Hill," Beautiful
","First off, this is not a game clone. If you have played the original Silent Hill video game, you'll have a fresh outlook on the story to look forward to. While the changes disturbed me a bit at first, I feel they were necessary to the overall success of Silent Hill the movie. Alice Krige does a beautiful job of making sure her character, the religious zealot, Christabella, does not sound contrived in her dialog, which would have been an easy mistake. The game version of the character Dahlia Gillespie is shallow and unchallenging, but Gans has reworked her into a believable person with real emotions, and Deborah Kara Unger really brings her to life for the first time! The visuals are grotesquely beautiful. Each creature has it's own feel, it's own texture, and it's own personality. They are ripped straight from the tortured mind of an emotionally and physically abused little girl, and they have a way of reminding you what it was like to be so young; everything distorted and frightening in your nightmares. They look as though made of plastic, yet they have flesh and bone and blood...symbolic of the toys of a small child, yet they are tainted with the horrible reality of the frailty of living things.The music is taken straight from the games, with minor 'facelifts' so to speak. Added instruments only make Akira Yamaoka's haunting melodies all the more addictive and frightening. This movie is a video game adaptation, yet has few of the pitfalls typical of the game movies before it. Do not be mistaken; Silent Hill is not a horror movie. It is at it's roots a drama...the story of a child forced down the path of evil to take revenge upon those who caused her such agony.",7,1,2,26 February 2007
