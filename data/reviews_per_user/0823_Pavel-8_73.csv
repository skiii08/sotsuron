Mission: Impossible III," Mission: Impossible = Wendy's.
","Making a good film sequel is a tricky task. The very reasons that demand a sequel are part of its downfall. The original is usually a good movie, or popular at the very least. Expectations are thus built in, and while succeeding at the box office often isn't difficult, creating a quality movie is an entirely different challenge. If a movie exceeds expectations ('Batman Begins'), then the reviews often rave more than they might have otherwise. Similarly, if a movie fails to deliver ('Matrix Revolutions, 'Godfather III'), opinions will be harsher than the film merits. Occasionally a movie will precisely intersect with the expectations (at least mine), resulting in a satisfying experience that doesn't stir the viewer aggressively one way or the other. Enter 'Mission: Impossible III'.Following 1996's very good 'Mission: Impossible' and 2000's so-so sequel, 'M:I-3' takes place not long following, as Tom Cruise's agent Ethan Hunt is trying to settle down in his relationship with Julia (Michelle Monaghan). Of course an international crisis arises, and he is therefore forced to balance his personal life with the immediate demands of his secret superspy life.That's where first-time movie director J.J. Abrams comes in. As creator of television's 'Alias' and 'Lost', his specialty is exploring the personal and psychological sides of people placed in extreme situations, an aspect that needed to be injected into this franchise. The original touched on it a little, but was so plot-driven that character was scarcely necessary. 'M:I-2' tried to add a personal touch, but in a largely ineffective manner more referenced than shown. Blatantly adding a layer of humanity in this third edition proves to be a key choice if for no other reason than to differentiate it from its predecessor.That is because the 'M:I-3' itself is fairly straightforward, with a plot complex in a less gimmicky way than 'M:I-2' but not as labyrinthine as 'M:I'. In fact the lack of uniqueness is the movie's biggest weakness. Little of the movie is poorly done, but the wow factor is also largely absent. With the exception of one good cringe-inducing moment, nothing will induce a significant reaction from the viewer. This can be attributed to the inherent nature of both the franchise and the genre. It's a Mission: Impossible movie, so you know you're getting outrageous stunts, daring covert operations, and plenty of action; and you more or less know who's living and dying. You don't know the precise route the movie is going to take, you know the starting point, the destination, and a few pit stops in between. Like a superhero film, suspension of disbelief is required, but there is no ethereal mythos present in good superhero movies, which limits the emotional power here.All of that that isn't entirely a bad thing. There's a comfort in seeing familiar characters in a mostly predictable action flick, as long as the movie is decently made, which this is. Abrams does not take noticeable chances, but more importantly he does not make noticeable mistakes. He does not overwhelm the story with his style, something that John Woo struggled with in 'M:I-2'. Abrams' trademark hand-held camera shots, which looked like they might be obtrusive in the trailers, work well with the kinetic energy of the picture. Once 'M:I-3' kicks things in gear, it doesn't stop, and still wraps things up in timely fashion. Abrams wisely kept the movie compact at just over two hours, in part by opting not to explain key MacGuffins and omitting scenes that would have been redundant, leaving the movie fresh enough to please until the end.'Mission: Impossible III' is cinematic fast food. You choose a restaurant like Wendy's because you like something there (mmm...spicy chicken) and you know what you're getting. When finished, you aren't blown away by the quality, but neither are you left wanting for something better. Same thing here. Given the path that this franchise has traveled, you won't walk out raving about 'M:I-3', but neither will you be disappointed. While that leaves the viewer in a strange emotional limbo, it's also reassuring that decent summer blockbusters can still be produced in an era with far too many big budget disasters like 'Catwoman'.Bottom Line: Go see it. Have a good time. Enjoy the ride. 7 of 10, which may be a point high just because it's the start of the summer season.",8,0,1,25 May 2006
United 93," A potent reminder of tragedy and the power of the human spirit.
","Made less than five years after the terrorist attacks of September 11th, 'United 93' is a film that could have failed on a dozen different levels. Perhaps the chronological proximity and the sobriety of the events minimize the artistic license taken, which in turn contributes to the film's realistic power, which is as compelling as any in cinema since 'Saving Private Ryan'.'United 93' tastefully concentrates on the titular flight, which was the day's sole hijacked airplane that failed to reach its destructive destination. Equally enlightening are scenes set in a handful of air traffic control centers, ranging from the regional to the national level, and one military outpost. The cumulative effect, which fascinatingly is not explicitly noted until the closing titles, points out how truly heroic the efforts of those on United 93 were, considering how utterly confused those on the ground were. The film also parenthetically comments on the changes in the mindset and security of America in the last half decade, not preaching but rather just noting in retrospect. Much like the bombing of Pearl Harbor, numerous incidents in the film leave the viewer in head-shaking wonder as to how they occurred. One must realize that for the most part the tragedies were not due to incompetence, but the unfathomable concepts behind the nefarious plots. Remembering how different things like air travel were five years ago will make one realize how much innocence was lost on that fateful day and how drastically the world has evolved in the short time since then.Although British, Director Paul Greengrass proves to be a near perfect choice to helm 'United 93', no doubt due to his prior experience with films similar in content ('Bloody Sunday') and style ('The Bourne Supremacy'). 'Sunday' was a bleak docudrama about Irish protesters who were killed by British troops, a likewise resonant theme (at least from the Irish perspective). His jittery hand-held camera method, borderline nauseating in 'Supremacy', works very well in the more static environment, effectively depicting the confined chaos of the day's events.The wisest choices made by Greengrass and company are intentional decisions to avoid convention. Virtually no familiar faces or names appear among the cast, and many of the professionals actually play themselves. Even casting character actors with recognizable faces would have degraded the film, as the actors' anonymity contributes heavily to the film's natural and relatable everyman quality. There are few of those overly dramatic shots that can only occur when knowing what happens next. Several shots do linger, but are more poignant than heavy-handed, and would likely be unnoticeable if the viewer didn't know the future.Being cognizant of the entire story definitely strengthens the emotional impact, uniquely accenting the drama of mundane events rather than plot direction. Leading up the hijacking, all of the flight's events, expressed as normally as possible, serve as an contrasting anticipatory requiem far more heart-wrenching than any such scene bolstered with slow motion or dramatic music. Imagine how differently one would view every little thing knowing it was one's last time to experience such minutia. That is the quiet power of these early scenes.If there is a misstep, it is simply in trying to cover too much. But such an error could easily have been glaring instead of subtle, and the brisk two-hour running length is refreshingly neither compacted nor strung out. However, bouncing from the intimate setting on the flight to the more impersonal bedlam among controllers produces an occasionally uneven tenor that disrupts the emotional connection. That dissimilitude is also a necessary evil though, as seeing the collage of events is required to contextualize the key individual snapshot.For those who looking for a gripping and affecting true story that provides rare optimism about the human race, or perhaps for those who are curious to see how our nation has changed so much in so little time, this will likely be one of the best movie experiences of the year. But as well as the 'United 93' was made, it is not for everyone. Some people simply will not be comfortable watching these events, whether it be the recent nature of the attacks or the genre itself. Those people are not at fault, as once familiar shots and stories are again shockingly potent. This is not a film that everyone should see, although everyone ought to be reminded of the themes present.Some will come away dwelling on the failures that took place, but that's not what the film is about. 'United 93' cathartically calls attention to what changed that day, how it did so, and the honorable self-sacrificial traits that surfaced in a time of crisis. 9 of 10 for what might be the best film of the year.Bottom Line: A weighty yet touching social and emotional statement, and recommended viewing before the the onslaught of summer blockbusters.",9,1,5,12 May 2006
Minority Report," What sci-fi should be.
","**Warning! Spoilers Ahead!**Steven Spielberg does science-fiction, and the result is exactly what I hoped it would be. Not only does he provide a visual buffet of special-effects, but also gives us a solid story that is part action film, part introspective drama. Tom Cruise, perfectly cast as the falsely (?) accused John Anderton, gives the film a somewhat nebulous moral and emotional center. But the best part of the film is the world in which it is set.Spielberg uses special effects as they should be used, so that you never think that they are effects.  My favorite, the search-and-destroy spiders, which seem more like models or remote controlled mechanisms, highlight a film peppered with futuristic technology, all of which seems reasonably possible in the not too distant future.The plot twist preceding the third act is solid. While I knew something off-the-wall had to be coming, I hadn't thought of that. The villain is a touch predictable, providing a mix of two movie staples: the 'Most Unlikely Person' and the 'Character who Disappears for a Long Stretch of Time.' But despite that, the movie still flows well and holds up strongly upon a repeat viewing. Some didn't care for the ending, and while it could be considered cliche, I found it quite satisfying.Bottom Line: Stellar sci-fi. A perfect molding of the future, technology, and humanity around a good story.",9,0,0,11 March 2003
Finding Neverland," 'Finding Neverland' has nothing to do with Michael Jackson (phew).
","'Finding Neverland' is a fact-based story about the life of J.M. Barrie, the author of the classic play and book 'Peter Pan'. Although the setting is England in the early 1900s, the movie is a sort of fantasy picture, often set within the imaginations of the characters. As Barrie, Johnny Depp is a playwright who is struggling with two things, fulfilling his marriage and capturing his creative output on stage. When he encounters a widow and her four children in the park, the quintet provide a conduit for his flowing imagination, an outpouring that results in the play for which Barrie is best known, as well as his domestic issues crescendoing to an ultimatum.The power of imagination is the driving theme of 'Neverland', and is also where the movie excels. During the adventures of Depp and the children, the picture jumps back and forth from the backyard or park to the theater of the mind, which ranges from dense jungle to the raging open seas. These transitions are exactly why cinema exists, to work as the mind does while reading a book, breaking the typical space continuum of stage and being. As good as these parts were, they could have been even better with more screen time or more elaborate production design. As it was, they are still the highlight of the film, but leave the viewer wanting more. The medium also allows the audience to observe how 'Peter Pan' was conceived. I grew up watching the animated Disney movie countless times, reading the book, even playing the titular character in a play, so seeing how Barrie's mind transforms commonplace events into fantastical adventures was exceptionally thrilling for me. I don't think that a knowledge of the book is required, but it definitely enhances the viewing experience, as you will not only pick up on the obvious clues, but also find other hints scattered throughout.Depp turns in a fine performance as Barrie, earnestly illustrating the emotional frustration that he endures under the restraining expectations of society. While Depp shines as usual, the rest of the adult cast is merely passable, despite marquee names like Kate Winslet, Dustin Hoffman, and Julie Christie. The blame should not be pinned on them entirely however, as their parts are generally stock characters seemingly there simply for Depp to act against. The children's roles also suffer a bit from the script. Although all the youngsters are good, their words are often overly mature. But their eager and innocent faces are just as important, and in that realm they all succeed wildly.What irks me most about 'Neverland' is Barrie's flawed character. The creative aspects of his life are wonderfully presented, but the domestic portions emit a sketchy moral vibe. Despite the film's best efforts at portraying his wife as a borderline villain, I found her complaints about Barrie's physical and emotional absence understandable. Yes, they had many differences, both personal and societal, but to me that doesn't excuse his discomforting emotional affair, even if it spawned an all-time great piece of literature.Despite that flaw, 'Finding Neverland' is a fresh look at the liberating and connecting power of the imagination, and a glimpse into the creation of a classic, blissfully free of the pretense that often accompanies would-be Oscar candidates, Not as great as some critics think, but it provides a frequently enchanting experience, reminiscent of last year's Big Fish.Bottom Line: It made most of the women in my theater cry, and brought a smile to my face. 7 of 10.",7,0,0,5 January 2005
Memento," One of the best ever.
","**Warning!  Mild Spoilers Ahead!**After watching this slick and unique thriller, I was partially confused and entirely satisfied.  The concept of telling part of the story backwards, while not completely original, brought a freshness to the movie and provided that rare and enjoyable thinking theater experience.  Days, weeks, months, even years after I first saw it, I still discuss it w/ friends as we argue about what really happened.  The acting was stellar.  Carrie-Anne Moss surprised as a foul-mouthed vixen with questionable motives.  Guy Pearce displayed his confusion and intentions subtly and effectively.  Joe Pantoliano was his usual solid self as the shady Teddy.  And the supporting cast filled their roles admirably. 
Plus, the film was technically superior.  The timing of the jumps back and forth in time was perfect.  What makes the film is the script and the direction.  This would not have been an easy story to tell in chronological order, let alone in this manner.  Christopher Nolan has the story completely under his control the entire time, providing a tight and taut film experience.Bottom line: Flat-out brilliant film-making and story-telling. One of the best films I've ever seen.  I don't throw high ratings around, but this one earned 10 of 10.",10,0,2,12 March 2003
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Good summertainment. Pass the rum.
","**Warning! Mild Spoilers Ahead!**If I were given $125 million and told to make a B-movie about pirates, 'Pirates' would be something I wouldn't mind coming up with. The flick works because it doesn't quite take itself seriously. Had it been a straight forward movie, boredom would have set in sooner, but the tongue-in-cheek humor makes it endurable.At the core of the askance goofiness is Johnny Depp, who plays Captain Jack Sparrow, a pirate of questionable skills and methods, in a half-drunk manner that can't be taken too seriously. He embodies all things pirate, complete with cliches, sarcastic remarks, and rum. Initially his odd mannerisms threw me, as I didn't quite understand why he couldn't walk straight. But as his character was fleshed out, everything made sense; and Depp's brilliance was understood. He and his character carried the movie, in part because every time Pirates drifted towards over-the-top seriousness, a mere glance or comment from Depp put it back in its proper place. Popcorn movies don't usually supply opportunities for great performances, and maybe there wasn't one written. Depp, however, took the part to a level beyond the movie itself.The rest of the cast ranged from servicable to good. Orlando Bloom finally starred in a movie without his pointy ears, and did quite well as blacksmith apprentice Will Turner. Although he didn't have much to work with in a combination role as both straight man and hero, he filled those roles admirably, proving once again that he has a stellar screen presence.The striking Keira Knightley, in a slightly different role than Bend it Like Beckham, doesn't have much to do as the damsel in distress. But she presents Elizabeth as a step up from the token screamer. Her long figure and bold facial features (Natalie Portman-esque) draw attention as well. She and Bloom make quite the on-screen duo.Geoffrey Rush leads the rest of the cast as Captain Barbossa, the requisite evil pirate and Sparrow's nemesis. He eats up his part, nearly outdoing Depp in the campiness department. Everyone else is competent, looking their parts well, but doing little more.Aside from Depp's performance, the look of the movie was the highlight. The rich and colorful palette of the film enhanced the bold lifestyle embraced by such rogues. The sweeping cinematography, meant to be seen on the big screen, captured the feeling of living such a sea-bound life, providing an experience that truly felt on location.Much has been made of ILM's skeletal special effects, and they deserve whatever praise they receive. Simply designing the skeletons and their smooth movements is impressive enough. But the real accomplishment is the phenomenally fluid transition of the undead from flesh to bone when moving in and out of moonlight. This movie should at least get a look when the Academy Awards come around.Surprisingly for a pirate movie, the sound is quiet during the opening scenes, so quiet that the rumbling bass from the neighboring theater intruded on my screening. But once the action accelerated, the sound did as well. Fortunately it did not reach the ear-splitting levels of previous Bruckheimer fare like 'Armageddon', plateauing at a loud but manageable volume, providing a pleasant aural experience.That experience was enhanced by the score of Klaus Badelt. He is clearly a disciple of Hans Zimmer, as the music rings of Zimmer's 'Gladiator'.  It is also reminiscent of 'Mask of Zorro'. The strings and horns drove forward with the action of the movie, especially during the climactic scenes. Some may find the music over-bearing, but for a movie such as this, it is quite appropriate.As much as I've raved thus far, I rate this movie only 6 out of 10 (still a thumbs up in my book) for a number of reasons. Unfortunately, 'Pirates' has a running time (nearly 150 minutes) that matches the titular length. Trimming 20-30 minutes off, mostly at the beginning and end, would have made this film much better, limiting the lulls between action. After the humorous introduction to Sparrow, the exposition was too long. Depp portrayed the part well enough that we didn't need every single aspect of his character explicitly shown. In the last half hour, the battle scenes between the undead and the British, while visually attractive, were both too long and unnecessary. Since the pirates were immortal at that point, shouldn't they have overrun the British more quickly? They could have easily reached the ship later and just commenced the fight when the curse was lifted. The inclusion of a mandatory happy-ending epilogue was fine, but it too dragged, because the writers had to politely wrap up the love triangle.
Speaking of which, the whole Elizabeth-Commodore Norrington romance angle should have been axed. Not only did it add length, it overstated the fact that Elizabeth and Turner were going to fall in love. Speaking of needless romantic angles, the ambiguous past between Sparrow and Anamaria should probably have been trimmed too. I'm guessing there was more to it in the original cut, but most of that was eliminated, leaving the small remaining parts out of place.Speaking of out of place, the comedic relief pirates and soldiers, although amusing at first, quickly wore out their welcome. Characters such as theirs are usually present in Disney movies, but in a more 'adult' flick, particularly one already replete with humor, the cheap comedy only annoyingly slows down the pacing.But the biggest problem with Pirates is that for all its positives, the movie still is not truly interesting. It does engage, but does not pique interest. There is just too much going on between too many people to really care about what's occurring. Don't get me wrong. It's an enjoyable film from which you will likely remember a handful of images; but outside of Captain Jack Sparrow, the depth is lacking. Maybe that will be remedied in the inevitable sequel(s)...Bottom Line:  Good summertainment. 6 of 10. Pass the rum.",6,1,2,17 July 2003
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Narnia provides the best movie experience of the year (for me).
","Let's get something out of the way: this is not an easy movie for me to review with objectivity, because more than any other story adapted to film, I have a personal connection to The Chronicles of Narnia. My dad read them to me when I was very young. I've read the entire series myself at least a dozen times. I've listened to the tapes so many times that I hear that inflection when I read the books. I was Peter in a kindergarten rendition of this movie. Author C.S. Lewis's wardrobe is at my college. I took a Lewis class there. I took a Narnia class in high school. The freaking name of my high school comes from these books. So yeah, I have something invested in the books. Having said that, I was apprehensive about how this story would be adapted in a movie world that has recently seen versions of 'Harry Potter' and 'Lord of the Rings', to both of which this would inevitably be compared. Most of those fears proved to be unnecessary, and I won't dwell on any book-to-movie discrepancies, which I thought mostly minor or acceptable artistic license, although I'm more than willing to discuss them. On with the show...The most famous of C.S. Lewis's beloved seven-book 'Chronicles of Narnia' series, 'The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe' follows the adventures of the Pevensies, four British siblings, as they stumble into the fantasy world of Narnia, where they find themselves in the center of a conflict between good and evil. A land replete with talking creatures ranging from beavers and wolves to centaurs and fauns, Narnia is reminiscent of Middle Earth, but like the entire story, is based in mythology more classic than epic, with a black-and-white fairy tale feel that is evident on screen.Greatly aiding that mystical sense is the score of Harry Gregson-Williams. With 'LWW', the film veteran ('Shrek', 'Kingdom of Heaven') finally has a known theme to place alongside his name. Dominated by strings, his melodies accentuate the tale with a light (but firm when necessary) nature appropriate for such a magical land. Likewise the vivid cinematography of Donald McAlpine ('Moulin Rouge') never gets too big (ahem...'Troy'...ahem). The camera suitably swoops and soars with the action at times, keeping the scenery bright and fresh, wisely eschewing the bold, dark edge (and PG-13 rating) of 'LOTR' and the mechanical nature of the first 'Harry Potter' movies, always returning to the children, the core of the story.These two technical aspects highlight the greatest triumph of 'LWW': the overall tone, which was was a pitch-perfect amalgam of fantasy and reality that is aimed at a young audience. Unlike many such movies, 'LWW' is based in the real world (WWII Britain), but spends much of its time in a fictional one. Smoothly transitioning between while still distinguishing the two is more difficult that it might sound. But by focusing on the children (all of whom acquit themselves well) and properly telling the story from their perspective, the story primarily moves along at a brisk pace, and 'LWW' accomplishes that task.I know this isn't phenomenal cinema like 'The Lord of the Rings', although the gap is smaller than you might think once you factor in the story's younger target audience. 'The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe' features similar and simpler motifs of love and sacrifice, good and evil, life and death. These quintessential themes are wrapped in the magical shell of Narnia, a place that appeals to the wide-eyed child in everyone, not just those who have read the books. Who doesn't want to happen upon an alternate universe and find amazing adventures there? Who doesn't want to encounter talking animals and mythical creatures? The exploits on screen are such that they will appeal to anyone with a pulse and an imagination.Knowing the story does alter the movie experience. If you have read the book, little of the plot is surprising, which eliminates much of the novelty. However, familiarity alternatively provides a tear-inducing satisfaction, like watching a loved one accomplish something exceptional. Hearing great lines spoken, seeing previously unseen people and places, enjoying small moments that are thoughtfully included, and noticing references to the rest of the series; all of these things indescribably form the happiest movie experience I have ever encountered, a singular blend of relief, joy, exhilaration, and contentedness.As for the inescapable comparisons to its contemporaries, based purely on its cinematic merits, I place 'LWW' ahead of three Harry Potter movies, and behind 'Prisoner of Azkaban' and 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy. Because of my intimate ties with the source material, I crafted a more personal connection with this film than the others. Sure it was a bit slow at times; yes, the Pevensies were a little too one-note; maybe the CGI looked a tad awry at times (although I would attribute much of that to the blatant weirdness of seeing talking animals); but I willingly blinded myself to the movie's minor shortcomings, and in return received an unmatched cinematic experience.Bottom Line: I hope that everyone else can find a fraction of the joy that I did through these books and this movie. 9 of 10.",9,1,2,14 December 2005
Spider-Man 2," Second verse, same as the first.
","After a superb set of opening credits that artfully recap the prequel, 'Spider-Man 2' ('S2') picks up two years after the original left off, although the elapsed time is barely noticed. Among the familiar characters, Peter Parker/Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire) is fighting through college and criminals; Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) is starring in a Broadway play; and Harry Osborn (James Franco), who still blames Spider-Man for his father's death, is running OsCorp. The company is aiding Doctor Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) in his attempt to create a form of fusion that produces perpetual energy. You can probably guess what soon happens. As is often the case, this sequel has lost some of the novelty that carried the original. There are only so many ways Spidey can swing through skyscraper canyons, although a couple new twists do elicit oohs and aahs. In place of that originality are human emotions that expound upon what Peter was battling at the end of the first movie. As in the 'Batman' films, this humanity makes 'S2' better; in this case, better than the original.Despite this humanity, and also addressing great movie themes like love, revenge, courage, and destiny, 'S2' falls short of greatness, largely because of how those themes are addressed. Too often longish dialogue scenes are used to explain the inner conflicts of characters, rather than pictures and actions. The pace change isn't a problem, but the heavy-handedness is. Perhaps for once the audience was underestimated. We know that the Marvel comics are supposed to touch on themes beyond the action, and don't need them to be force-fed. Especially with a quality actor like Maguire, we can see the inner conflict, and that is enough. We don't need Aunt May's five minute speech filled with double meanings. Peter's main issue is how to be 'normal' while fighting crime. Primary amongst his concerns and the movie's plot is his love for MJ, because the ones he loves are constantly in danger from his enemies. But alas, due to the emphasis of the trite romantic story, the most interesting relationship of the movie, between Peter and Harry, is disappointingly (although understandably) under-developed. Young Osborn can't let go of his father's death. Because Peter is Spider-Man's personal photographer, their friendship is constantly strained, made more complicated by the plot progression. That is a very unique situation that I wish had been explored more deeply. But unfortunately, their relationship may not be further fleshed out until the third installment, which promises to be the best one yet.I'm generally a fan of the superhero genre, but neither this movie nor its predecessor connected with me. Part of the reason is derived from the typical storyline. Not once during the course of the movie was I particularly surprised by anything. Part of the reason was Kirsten Dunst, whose performance in a cliché role wasn't bad, but wasn't good either. She tries just a bit too hard, as though in an objective role, attempting to nail the part, rather than be the part. My personal bottom line though is that Spider-Man simply doesn't do it for me. I can't fully explain it; that's just how it is. Fortunately the overall craftsmanship of the movie, including quality performances from Maguire, Franco, and Molina, is good enough to overshadow those issues. Although not perfect, the special effects mesh nicely with the comic book nature that director Sam Raimi has created. The visuals add to the almost cartoonish edge without distracting from the reality. Danny Elfman (Men in Black) has again composed an excellent score for an comic-based movie. His syncopated tunes, rife with percussive orchestral notes, provides enjoyable background music while appropriately accompanying the action. In sum, the world of Spider-Man is now established, and all hands are very comfortable with their work, as evidenced by the uniform look. Much like the original, 'S2' is a good solid superhero movie, easy to watch and filled with action and melodrama. I didn't like it as much as many critics and fans, but I don't think you'll be disappointed if you spend $10 and two hours on 'Spider-Man 2'.Bottom Line: Good, not great. Some will love it, but Spider-man just doesn't do it for me. 7/10.",7,0,1,5 July 2004
The Hustler," Great games of pool. Not as great otherwise.
","The Hustler is a classic 1961 film about the shady pool halls of the post-WWII era. Anyone of the three main characters could fill the titular role, whether it be Paul Newman's up-and-comer, Jackie Gleason's man-to-beat, or George C. Scott's behind-the-scenes angle-shooter.These three stars (all-Oscar nominated) carry the picture, both individually and collectively. The thirty-ish Newman is simply a revelation to anyone (me) who hasn't seen him act much in his prime. He perfectly captures the smooth, in control but on the edge persona of Fast Eddie, who has the physical tools, but not necessarily the mental skills to be a champion. Gleason likewise perfectly fills the body and clothes of Minnesota Fats, with a graceful elegance uncommon to a man of his size. Scott (who declined his Oscar nomination) could easily have been overshadowed in his role, but his subtle and shifty eyes and movements create a character that occasionally outshines his two huge co-stars.The Hustler reaches its zeniths when at least two of these men are on the screen. The dialogue exchanges of Newman and Scott as they feel each other out crackle with intensity. Gleason and Scott ooze wary respect for each other; and Newman and Gleason combine admiration and competitiveness into one neat package from which the entire film derives its energy.A film about pool sharks seems to demand brilliant representation of its colorful world. But French cinematographer Eugene Shuftan instead opts for black-and-white, which surprisingly works wonderfully. His Oscar-winning imagery particularly excels in displaying light and shadows, such as the sun streaming into smoke-filled billiards halls. Shuftan accomplishes an exceptional feat, using a monotone style to effectively paint vivid pictures.Despite high achievement in so many areas, The Hustler suffers from Doughnut Syndrome: there's a hole in the middle. The pool scenes that bracket the story are very good, and one middle scene between Newman and Scott is the best of the film, but the romantic portion of the story flounders. The drifter Newman falls for a fellow drifter (Piper Laurie) for no apparent reason, other than alcohol and the fact that they're both alone. To their credit, they do acknowledge that their relationship is flimsy and depraved, but the movie squanders too much times on this wafer-thin story arc, rather than stick with what works.Those parts succeed wildly, about as enjoyable as any scenes ever shot, but without adequate buttressing material, the film as a whole falls short of the high watermark left by its parts.Bottom Line: Phenomenal at times, but subpar at others, the male performances carry the film. Seven of ten, but definitely worth viewing if you haven't seen it yet.",7,20,30,7 June 2005
Juno," Cute and likable.
","Independent films are an interesting breed. Made outside the mainstream studio structure, the best ones compensate for their lower production value with a better story and characters. Every year an indie or two does captures the collective fascination of critics and the public by doing so. This year's darling is 'Juno', the name of the newly pregnant teenage girl around whom the simple story revolves.Like many such films, 'Juno's' strengths lie in its unique characters. Foremost among them is the titular one, who has a singular vernacular and attitude that carries the movie. As she decides what to do with the child, she must also deal with the various reactions from her family and friends. But rather than become depressed or reclusive, Juno instead chooses a positive approach, dealing with her issues directly and responsibly. This leads to a relatively sunny take on subjects often approached in a dark or politically charged manner. The movie does tell you what to think about issues; it does not argue strongly either way; it just tells you what characters are doing, and gives a little of their rationale, somewhat like Clint Eastwood's phenomenal 'Million Dollar Baby' a few years back.On one hand, making light of serious situations like abortion and divorce feels wrong. Conversely, the ability and opportunity to laugh at potentially overbearing situations is a relief, and it is part of what makes us human. While such reactions likely would not be appropriate in reality, movies are not reality, but an escape in which a little levity is more than appropriate.From the guitar-laced harmonic strains of its soundtrack to the aforementioned quirky characters, 'Juno' is a quintessential indie flick. Like 'Garden State', it has a few transcendent glimpses into the human soul, but they are too few and far between to carry the movie to extreme heights. Like 'Little Miss Sunshine', it places quirky characters into unusual and often comic circumstances, but the humorous moments here do not approach the hilarity of 'Little Miss Sunshine'. Most of the comedy is based upon the unique dialogue or the continual series of culture clashes between Juno and everyone, which are amusing throughout.Some critics (Roger Ebert) are hailing 'Juno' as the year's best film, which is a drastic overstatement. Such grand labels are a joke, and a statement on how monotonous comedies have become. Its ipseity amidst the dramatic leanings of most Oscar contenders makes the movie better and more enjoyable than it actually should be. Juno is a cool breeze drifting through an open window, not an eye-popping blast from the air conditioner. It is enjoyable and well-crafted, not the best film of the year, maybe a fringe contender for the top ten.Bottom Line: The movie is equivalent to its main character: cute and likable, but lacking in a few areas. Recommended primarily for indie fans. 7 of 10.",7,3,11,18 January 2008
The Day After Tomorrow," It's like 'Independence Day'...except not at all.
","** Warning! Major spoilers appear in the clearly marked paragraph!**Eight years ago, director Roland Emmerich exploded onto the mainstream movie scene with the summer blockbuster 'Independence Day,' starring Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum. Now four years after releasing The Patriot, Emmerich returns with 'The Day After Tomorrow,' a flick about what might happen if global warming were to melt the polar ice cap. The similarities to 'ID4' are striking, but unfortunately 'DaT' fails to replicate the askance, humorous attitude that flowed through 'ID4,' and that in turn results in a lesser movie. As in most of Emmerich's work, the story here is about survival, as individuals, groups, a society, and one family in particular. Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) is a climatologist who resides in D.C. and suspects the worst. His 17-year old son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) has traveled to New York City, which happens to be right in the line of a major storm. As global warming sets a new Ice Age in motion, we follow their exploits: Sam as he simply tries to survive, and Jack as he determines what is going on and how he can save Sam. Throw in a attractive girl (Emmy Rossum) for Sam and an ex-wife for Jack, and you have all the makings of a traditional summer blockbuster. Which is exactly what you will get. There are no real surprises anywhere in the movie, not even those of the foreseen variety. Everything proceeds precisely as expected during the previous five minutes. That doesn't necessarily detract from the movie, but it does prevent the flick from climbing past the level of summertainment. Perhaps more than anything, 'DaT' is trapped in a cage of its own making, thanks to the plot, writing, and casting. 'ID4' succeeded because of its very good blend of action and humor, which was facilitated by the subject matter. An alien invasion is much easier to make light of than apocalyptic weather. With that handicap, the onus falls on the script, which is average at its best and unintentionally comedic at its worst. That's even with the on-set rewrites that Gyllenhaal demanded due to corny dialogue. The writing simply neglected the development of characters beyond stock personalities and also contained little humor outside of the occasional throw-away lines.
Part of the latter complaint can be pinned on the a combination of casting and acting. Smith and Goldblum made 'ID4' with their humor, much of which was ad-libbed or rewritten with their input. None of that light-hearted nature is present in 'DaT.' Place a little blame on the cast, but place as much on the script and casting. Believe it or not, choosing Will Smith for 'ID4' was a big gamble at the time, but it worked out in a grand way. The choices of actors in DaT are much safer. With the possible exception of Gyllenhaal, no one plays an unusual part or adds anything fresh or dynamic to the roles. Gyllenhaal combines the ennui of his 'Good Girl' character with the intelligence of his part in 'October Sky' to advance a stock character a step above what most actors would. While maintaining a level head, his Sam seems to appreciate the absurdity of what is happening. Maybe that's because Gyllenhaal was in a congruent situation himself. Aside from him, no one performs poorly, but no one stands out either. Quaid and Ward step into more fatherly/motherly roles, but ones without the meat of their parts in 'The Rookie' or 'The Fugitive.' They're good, but we've seen them better. The rest of the cast ranges from quite solid (Ian Holm, in a role that strangely makes him disappear in a different way) to simply adequate (everyone else).
But the movie wasn't all bad. Although I sense that some of the scientific aspects of 'DaT' were awry, I can't be certain and therefore was not bothered by them. The good news is that the scripted events allow for excellent special effects. These are the visuals that I like. Explosions and battles are one thing, because those are 'real', in that they happen, and could be staged if the cost were not prohibitive. But the events of 'DaT' could not be staged and will likely never occur. That's what makes them so enjoyable, much like 'ID4,' in which other landmark buildings are destroyed. Having been to New York City, seeing waves careen through city blocks was quite intriguing to me in a twisted sort of way. Likewise I'm sure for anyone who has visited Los Angeles or any of the other decimated locations. The visual effects are done very well, perhaps even (dare I say it so early) Oscar-worthy (gasp). We have never seen anything like that before, and Emmerich's vision, for which he is to be commended, combines with the stellar work of effects houses, evokes thrills and chills with every gust of wind and crash of wave. These visuals alone are just about worth a ticket, and because of them I don't feel as though I wasted my money. That's about as high a compliment as can be paid. SKIP THE NEXT PARAGRAPH TO AVOID SPOILERS! Allow me to rant for a minute. Why are the wolves in the movie at all?? There was enough drama and action involving the kids racing the storm back to the library. The wolves were completely pointless, and not in the way that Jack's wife was unnecessary. The wolves were something so random that a collective Huh? went up in the theater when they reappeared. The survivors could have at least killed and eaten one. I think I'll pretend that part didn't even exist. As for Jack's wife, why was she in the movie? This is not a knock on Ward at all; she was fine. But call Jack a single parent, cut her scenes out, and you have a shorter, cleaner movie that would no doubt grip the audience better thanks to less melodrama. That's enough for now...
END SPOILERS When I first saw the original trailer for 'The Day After Tomorrow' last fall, I was psyched to see the film. The trailer explained that the Earth underwent a climate shift, causing utter calamity. That's it. Nothing more. A perfect trailer. Unfortunately, the final product doesn't live up to that potential, fading instead into a blase family-survival picture, a by-the-numbers movie that features the spectacular meteorological destruction of much of the planet. At best, DaT is decent mindless entertainment, fodder for those who enjoy poking fun at cinematic inadequacies. Bottom Line:  Another summer popcorn movie. Enjoyable for the visual effects, but definitely not a must-see.  5/10.",5,0,1,31 May 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Close your eyes and pretend it's all a bad dream.
","Batting third in the summer of the sequel lineup is 'Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End'. Shot simultaneously with last year's 'Dead Man's Chest', this one picks up where that one left off. Which is to sayI have no idea.Okay, that's not entirely true. When last we saw Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow, he was being swallowed by the giant sea monster Kraken, which means that he's now surrounded by himself in a strange sort of purgatory located, that's right, at world's end.The story initially involves getting Jack back from Davy Jones' locker, which is necessary in order to save pirates from extinction, because (if you remember from the second one) the British Navy is holding Jones' heart hostage, and thus forcing him (he's the octopus-faced undead pirate) to exterminate the remaining pirates. If you were able to follow all that, good, because that's the most comprehensible portion of the plot. It's the trunk, from which plot lines and motives sprout like Hydra heads from every possible location, layering on additional story arcs that only complicate things. Hammering out all the whys and hows would take far more time and effort than such a movie is worth. Too often, the details of what's happening are fuzzy or uncertain, which is most frustrating because the plot is actually relatively simple.Fortunately, that barely matters, because the point of the movie is to create moments and imagery that awe and enchant. On this level, Pirates 3 succeeds wildly. There are battles with visual effects so stunning that they are scarcely noticed. There's a great scene accompanied by wailing electric guitars that calls to mind the classic westerns of Eastwood and Wayne. The dramatic score is again filled with hard-driving strings and horns that rile adrenaline and make for an over-the-top movie experience. Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom are still beautiful people. There's a great cameo by a legendary rocker, and Depp still owns the idiosyncratic Captain Jack in every way possible. Just look at that poster! Is that not the epitome of cinematic coolness? All these similarities to the first two are good, but also part of the problem. Some sequels ('Shrek the Third') get ripped because they are too different from their predecessors. Others get downgraded because they are too similar, which is the category that 'Pirates 3' falls into. Many of the parts are good, but essentially it's is just more of the same, with an emphasis on the MORE. There is too much here in the almost three hour movie. Continuing the tree trunk analogy, the movie is an out-of-control tree that needs to be pruned back. Clip off those stray branches. Trim the bunny trails and betrayals. Shape the tree into a more presentable and palatable two hours plus.Bottom Line: 'Pirates 3' had its moments, and wasn't a bad experience overall, but the exhausting length constantly throws needless curves and double-crosses into the relentless fray. As my dad said at the end, 'I hope they stop.' 4 of 10.",4,0,3,3 July 2007
Spider-Man 3," This could be the end of Spider-Man.
","Buckle your seat belts. It's time for the summer movie season. Let's get this out of the way first: this is the summer of the sequel. Of the ten most hyped movies in the next four months, eight of them are sequels, and seven of those are at least the third in the series. Sequels are a tricky business, because there are often massive built-in expectations and points of reference. They can't be too similar to the prequels without risking boredom, but if they stray too far from the tone of the original, they risk alienating their audiences. Like last year's summer season, this year kicks off with the third movie in a blockbuster series. In 2006, the first out of the gate was 'Mission: Impossible 3'; in 2007, it is 'Spider-Man 3'.When we last left Spidey three years ago, he had rid the world of Doctor Octopus, and had his identity revealed to his two closest friends, his girlfriend Mary Jane and his buddy/enemy Harry Osborn, whose father was the Green Goblin in the original picture. 'SM3' picks up not long after, in a New York City where Spider-Man has gone glam, with his name and image plastered all over the media. Peter Parker relishes his newfound fame, so much that it begins to impede his relationship with Mary Jane. As that hits the rocks, he finds himself vulnerable at an inopportune time, which leads to the chaos that forms the crux of the movie.One strong point of the movie is that is has the same principal cast as first two and also possesses a continuous story arc. Both features (think about it) are actually rarities among superhero trilogies. That definitely helps in the continuity department, because the characters, locations, and relationships are familiar. On the downside, the similarities amplify the fact that little of the movie is original. We've seen Spidey swoop and soar through city canyons, and we've seen him fight nasty villains. With the exception of an early chase scene, nothing is particularly different, either in style or content. That's disappointing, as a Spider-Man movie begs to be exhilarating. Say what you will about the vastly different styles of the three Mission: Impossibles, but each of them had a unique feel that individually defined each movie and made like events more interesting.While the lack of novelty is disappointing, the most significant attempt at being unique provides the most unusual portion of the movie. As Parker/Spidey undergoes a transformation in the middle act, the movie takes a bizarre turn into romantic comedy. The idea is commendable; too few movies take too few chances. But this one doesn't work. For twenty minutes you understand what is happening, but still can't quite believe it. It would be like if Golden State had gone into a stall offense when they were up 20 against Dallas last night. Sure, it makes sense given the circumstances, but it still feels completely wrong and out of place.The bigger problem is the end consequence of the emotional speed bump. It's something very rare in superhero movies: Peter Parker is not likable. Granted, that is part of the point, but when one starts disliking the title character, one loses interest in the movie, and that is huge strike against this kind of flick.Like the later Batman installments, 'SM3' also has too many characters and stories for one movie. Instead of completely marginalizing the hero like 'Batman & Robin' did, 'SM3' races through the stories of the antagonists. Two of the three could easily have filled the requisite two-plus hours in finer fashion. Then the villains' stories could have been fleshed out better to create the rare well-rounded superhero movie. Not only that, but Peter Parker's issues could have been expanded as well, in a manner more like its predecessors. One of the taglines for the movie is The Battle Within, and that promising fight unfortunately is not fully addressed, though in a pleasant surprise, numerous positive themes of responsibility and choice are.Having said all that, I must provide the disclaimer that Spider-Man just doesn't do it for me. Batman does; Superman does; but Spider-Man doesn't. Maybe it has to do with Tobey Maguire's relatively diminutive stature, that I don't believe he could be a butt-kicking hero. Maybe the face-covering mask dehumanizes Spider-Man for me. Whatever.People won't care that much; 'Spider-Man 3' will still make a webful of money. If you like the other two Spider-Man movies, you'll enjoy this one, which isn't painful to watch. There are plenty of characters and eventually plenty of action. But 'Spider-Man 3' matches its predecessors ways it shouldn't and doesn't match them in ways it should.Bottom Line: 6 of 10 for the first big release of the summer and perhaps the final Spider-Man movie. Not bad, but nothing special.",6,0,0,3 July 2007
The Prestige," Great story. Well made.
","'Every great magic trick consists of three acts. The first act is called The Pledge; The magician shows you something ordinary, but of course... it probably isn't. The second act is called The Turn; The magician makes his ordinary some thing do something extraordinary. Now if you're looking for the secret... you won't find it, that's why there's a third act called, The Prestige; this is the part with the twists and turns, where lives hang in the balance, and you see something shocking you've never seen before.' The above quote is from perhaps the year's best trailer, and also appears early in 'The Prestige', which features one of the year's best casts and crew. The quote parallels the movie quite well, explaining what works, what doesn't, and why.Directed by home run hitter Christopher Nolan ('Batman Begins', 'Memento'), 'The Prestige' stars a couple erstwhile superheroes (Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale) woven into a turn of last century tale about two rival magicians intent on one-upping each other. Simple enough, that's The Pledge.The Turn, which takes up the majority of the running time, is where Nolan and company work their movie magic. The story is told largely through various flashbacks before going linear in last act. A little work is required to follow the multi-pronged timeline, but if one lets the pieces float for a bit, they will come together over the course of the film. The patience to wait for that confluence shouldn't be a problem, because all involved sell the period piece wholeheartedly. Capes, canes, and top hats often induce boredom, but although the costumes are period, 'Prestige' doesn't have the antiquated feel that many such films possess. Instead it radiates energy, feeling similar to a Broadway play thanks in part to the star wattage of Jackman and Bale, who both slip comfortably from rubber suits to three-piece suits. Their previous and future movie roles actually inject a little humor into the proceedings as one envisions Logan or Bruce Wayne donning such outfits and dealing with the various circumstances. Interestingly, Batman would likely be comfortable in this world, even though Prestige is set a century ago, because cinematographer Wally Pfister crafts a intriguing, borderline-Gothic world calls to mind his dark work in 'Batman Begins', a movie that appears very different, but also shares themes like mystery and illusion.As one would expect from a magic-themed movie and as The Prestige implies, there are a number of twists and turns, several of which are unveiled in the third act. Figuring these things out in advance may hamper or at least alter your enjoyment of the film, particularly if you are expecting to be surprised. In one sense a line from the movie is true: when the secret is known, the trick seems ordinary, and that extra layer of quality is stripped away. But such knowledge in no way ruins the showmanship of the trick, or in this case the remarkably high production value of the film, which pushes the a good story to a higher level.Bottom Line: A well-made film with an original story that entertains to the end. 8 of 10.",8,1,2,9 December 2006
Ocean's Twelve," Ocean's Twelve...or Thirteen...or Seventeen...whatever
","'Ocean's Eleven' is one of my favorite recent movies, as it seamlessly excels in nearly every aspect of film-making. So of course I eagerly anticipated the release of this sequel, 'Ocean's Twelve', although I did not expect a movie that matched up to the superb original.All of the actors and characters from that first film are back. The premise picks up about a year after the conclusion of 'Eleven', as Andy Garcia's villainous Terry Benedict is hunting down the men who robbed him. He threatens harm if they don't refund his money, so the eleven must reunite to pull another heist, this time in Europe.Infused with Soderburgh's brilliant cinematography, the first film was a smooth, sleek Hollywood production. The look matched the tone of the smooth, sleek caper pulled by the always-in-control titular crew. 'Ocean's Twelve' has a drastically different feel, as the classic subdued beauty of Europe substitutes for the modern flashiness of Las Vegas. As everyone hops around the continent, the singularity of the first film is almost recklessly replaced by the atmosphere of various countries. Initially bothersome, this tone eventually clicks with the characters, who themselves are less of a machine than before. The end result has the feel of an independent film, like something a bunch of friends made while partying, but with a $110 million budget. Of course from all reports that isn't far from the truth. The good news is that the congenial atmosphere produces a movie that oozes amicability. But even that sense of camaraderie cannot mask the deficiencies elsewhere in the picture.Most missed is the saavy overall film-making of the original. Whether it be the lack of creative shots (except for a plane landing) or the not-quite-as-crisp dialogue (throwaway lines in particular), Twelve simply isn't as much fun as the original. Granted, that's a high bar to clear, and the sequel is still better than most, but comparisons are inevitable. The Venetian blind wipes and clever use of titles spice things up; the actors' delivery is still timely; and small touches like the Boston-New York thing still shine, but ultimately the script doesn't quite measure up to the original. Instead of a tight and driving story that hoodwinks but explains fully and logically, Twelve utilizes two dei ex machina (or di or machinis or however the phrase is pluralized) that are not adequately buttressed, leaving the viewer feeling not robbed, but a little cheated.'Eleven' was a popcorn film, if there is such a thing, while 'Twelve' is more of a popcorn movie, meaning that is isn't as crisp or cohesive from a cinematic angle. Perhaps this was an purposeful choice intended to reflect the more haphazard nature of the story, but the method does not succeed as wildly.Bottom Line: Entertaining but not quite as satisfying as the original, 'Ocean's Twelve' is still better than most movies, worth a few bucks and a couple hours. 7 of 10.As a side question, any thoughts on which character was the titular twelfth? I think there is an easy answer, but I'm not sure it's the right one. In fact, I don't have an definite opinion. I posit that it's just a silly sequel title.",8,2,4,18 January 2005
Crash," Crash: Be ready to ponder.
","From Oscar-nominated screenwriter Paul Haggis ('Million Dollar Baby') comes his directorial debut, the adult drama 'Crash', a project that is nothing if not ambitious,commenting on many of the powerful and controversial themes that drive America and the world.'Crash' tells its complex story in fractured vignettes, as the non-traditional narrative tracks over a dozen main characters through a day in their Los Angeles-based lives, all of which are intertwined one way or another. Most of these parts are played well by recognizable faces, if not names, a wise decision that makes tracking the various participants very easy. These characters are a mix of blue collar workers like cops, locksmiths, and store owners, in addition to upper class people like a district attorney and a television producer. The impressive part of this massive character list is that although harsh and gritty, few if any of the portrayals are full stereotypes. Portions of many might be considered trite, but even those characteristics are addressed within the context of the film.With fathers, mothers, brothers, daughters, these characters collectively provide something for everyone to latch onto as they create some of the frankest discussion you will ever see on film. In doing so, the words avoid being gratuitously explosive, instead casually fitting into the ongoing events, as though the sometimes shocking statements are just normal conversation. In fact, I don't think it uncommon for many of the words to be spoken or pondered in private daily interaction. However seeing and hearing them emanate from the big screen is an entirely different beast, as the movie elucidates many of the thoughts and words nobody will publicly claim.Addressing touchy issues is a dangerous venture, but one that ultimately rewards more than restraint would have. Race and racism are the explicit themes that have garnered headlines, but beneath it all lies anger. One character poignantly comments on waking up angry for no apparent reason, and that is the root problem that lingers both within the film and within the viewer. Leaving the issue at racism (etc.) would have made for a decent film in itself, but pushing one step further thematically does likewise with the film, making it that much deeper, like the conversations you can have with a close friend as opposed to a casual acquaintance. Mix in the always potent themes of family, life, and death, and you have a film that at some point strikes to the very core of anyone.The power of 'Crash' stems from that introspection it triggers, encouraging the viewer to examine his own thoughts, motives, and reactions. This brings 'Traffic' to mind, even though 'Crash' lacks the powerful dramatic story arcs of Steven Soderburgh's work. The narrative here occasionally overwhelms emotionally, but does so inconsistently, perhaps because the constant moving between numerous tales slightly retards the emotion. From the intertwining story arcs to a song playing over the final act resolution to a strange something falling from the sky, the film most reminds of 'Magnolia', but without any sort of emotional upswing at the end. 'Crash' won't leave you feeling as optimistic, although it will make you think more.Accentuating the penetrating narrative is the tight cinematography. Gone are most of the usual scene-setting wide shots, smartly and cleverly replaced by cuts that switch locations by using congruent shots, such as tight images of two separate people opening a door. Close-ups of faces and hands permeate the picture, subtly but greatly adding to intimate nature of movie, emphasizing the personal level at which the story best connects. Also enhancing the mood is the soft bluish color palette, similar to the also L.A.-based 'Collateral'. But instead of the slick high definition video dominant in Michael Mann's picture, James Muro's frequently hand-held shots are grittier, reflecting the coarse lives and thoughts of the characters.Typical cinematic story lines need the questions raised within the film to be answered (ahem...'War of the Worlds'...ahem). Films like 'Crash' excel precisely because they leave the viewer to ponder the posited questions. Equal parts social commentary and observation, this is one of the more daring films of the last few years, Bottom Line: If you take the chance to see it, properly prepared mentally, you won't be disappointed; you will be pleasantly surprised on numerous levels. 8 of 10.",8,0,4,7 October 2005
Ocean's Thirteen," Analog players in a digital world.
","The latest movie in this summer of the sequel is a departure from the first three heavyweights of 'Spider-man 3', 'Shrek the Third', and 'Pirates 3'. Aimed more at adults than adolescents, 'Ocean's Thirteen' is the clean-up hitter this summer. In baseball, a clean-up hitter usually has power. 'Ocean's Thirteen' has star power, perhaps more than any other release this summer, and the movie wields its weapons well.While Julia Roberts and Catherine Zeta-Jones are not back for this installment, all the men of 'Ocean's Eleven' and 'Ocean's Twelve' do reprise their roles. George Clooney and Brad Pitt head up the gang of thieves, aided by Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, and the rest of the crew that moviegoers have come to know over the last six years. The biggest addition to the cast is a name bigger than all of them, and his character is the catalyst for the caper that drives the entire film. The man is Al Pacino, playing a flashy casino owner who incurs the gang's wrath by betraying Elliott Gould's Reuben Tishkoff, setting the stage for the rest of the revenge movie.The first film was a modern classic that thrived on the energy of Las Vegas and the cool confidence of Clooney and Pitt. Twelve lost much of those factors by bouncing around Europe and putting the band of thieves on the run. Thirteen returns to the franchise's successful roots, taking place predominantly in the colorful world of Sin City and also placing the heroes in control most of the time.In restoring those two key elements, 'Ocean's Thirteen' recaptures the spirit of the original. The dialogue isn't as crisp or smart, but it's close, and elements of the past glory are present. Things like con-man lingo and everyone bilingually communicating with The Amazing Yen provide well-done unexplained humor. Writers Brian Koppelman and David Levien (who penned quality guy flicks like 'Rounders' and 'Knockaround Guys') do overuse the borrowed elements, as though they decided to repeat the good parts of the original's script as often as possible, and the resulting jokes wear a bit thin over the course of the movie.Returning to Vegas is a wise choice that simplifies the plot. Though staples of heist movies, like double-crosses and sleight of hand, are present, the story is largely straight forward. You know what the guys are going to do; you're just watching to see how the crew overcomes the various inevitable obstacles. This makes it slightly less entertaining, but also makes for a very comfortable viewing experience, despite the required suspension of disbelief. The cinematography of Steven Soderbergh (under the pseudonym Peter Andrews) helps too; the pictures and transitions are not to the impressive level of 'Eleven', but they have their moments, as do the quirky uses of titles and graphics.As is the case in many sequels, the cast slides effortlessly back into their roles. Clooney and Pitt are smooth; Damon is trying to prove himself; Bernie Mac is a fast-talker, etc. As the new guy, Pacino effectively joins the fray with a surprisingly underplayed part. He's not the big, bold, brash near-caricature that he has morphed into through movies like 'Scent of a Woman' and 'The Devil's Advocate'. He still looks the over-the-top part with his deep tan and vibrant suits, but he is more kniving than bombastic, which is a very appropriate choice for the movie.'Ocean's Thirteen' is the cinematic version of a lazy river ride at a water park. You hop in your inner tube and cruise around the lengthy pool, admiring the view, chatting with friends, and generally enjoying the laid-back experience. Unlike many of this summer's blockbusters, it does not bombard you with loud effects or action scenes. It won't shock and awe you by pulling wool over your eyes with a mind-blowing twist. Instead, gentle turns and reveals are sprinkled throughout, providing an enjoyable two hours spent with familiar and entertaining characters.Bottom Line: A good summer diversion that returns to the roots of the series. Not as good as the first, but better than the second. 7 of 10.",7,0,1,3 July 2007
Lost in Translation," Velly good.
","'Lost in Translation' tells the story of two demographically different Americans who develop an intimate Platonic relationship while in Japan. Bill Murray plays Bob Harris, an aging movie star who has reluctantly made the trans-Pacific trek to cash in on a lucrative endorsement deal. Scarlett Johansson stars opposite Murray as Charlotte, a recently married young woman who is discovering that her marriage isn't what she thought it might be.
These two are the story of 'Lost in Translation,' as only a couple other characters have significant parts in this dramedy. Therefore the effectiveness of the entire film relies upon the effectiveness of Murray, Johansson, and the script of writer/director/producer Sofia Coppola. Fortunately their work is absolutely up to the challenge. Coppola wrote an screenplay that could easily have turned into a grand indictment of Hollywood or marriage, but instead opted for the less-traveled, unpretentious road of simplicity, concentrating the entire film on her odd couple. In a deliberately paced film (very similar to Coppola's 'The Virgin Suicides') such as this one, extraneous parts could have doomed it to mediocrity. But there are no gratuitous scenes that tell unneeded side stories, as each one either directly or indirectly leads back to the core relationship.Coppola and her crew emphasize the simplicity of the relationship by juxtaposing it with the vast size and craziness of bustling Tokyo. Times Square-esque shots of towering buildings with colossal dinosaurs and gaudy neon contrast wonderfully with two people quietly sitting at a sushi restaurant.In those quiet scenes, the onus is on the actors to move the film forward. This is a task much more difficult than most realize. Making true conversation heartfelt and impromptu without sounding fake is a vastly underappreciated art form, yet Johansson and Murray nail these scenes. Johansson in particular deserves credit for being every bit the equal of the veteran Murray, who no doubt improvised good chunks of their scenes. The scene on the bed merits individual praise. As the key point in the relationship, it is the fulcrum on which the entire film teeters. Had it failed, the film would not have garnered such praise. But it succeeds wildly, as the two characters open up to each other in gestures of true friendship rather than revert to one of the typical sexual encounters that plague many films.All of this good and well, but if no one can relate to the characters, then the film still isn't going anywhere. This is where Coppola's writing genius manifests itself. In her two leads, she has created characters that are at two of the most vulnerable times of a human's life. Johansson's just out of college and just-married character is still searching for her place in life, while Murray's fading actor is enduring a mid-life crisis of sorts. Having gone through similar issues, everyone can relate to at least one of their problems. That's the hook, and it works quite effectively.
'Lost in Translation' has won the Golden Globe for Best Comedy/Musical, which is an interesting categorization considering that the meat of the story is anything but comedic. The humor lies in the little things (pun intended) relating to the differences in cultures, which Coppola and Murray masterfully point out in funny yet not disrespectful ways. Quirks like the low shower head and Murray's height discrepancy are small but very necessary aspects of the film, keeping the mood from becoming overbearingly dreary. Those moments plus the generally upbeat nature of the main characters infuse the film with vitality despite its somber subject matter.
If there's a complaint I have about this film, it's the lack of a compelling force that drives the narrative. The script is not a traditional three-act play with rising and falling action. The plot is extremely linear, moving forward consistently but not dynamically. Because the story was very well told, this didn't bother me much, but it is about the only thing holding the film back from utter greatness.Bottom Line: 'Lost in Translation' is not a film that will leave you slack-jawed or emotionally drained. Therefore its excellence may not be initially appreciated. But upon mental review, I realized how little was wrong and how much was right with the film. It will stick with anyone who finds themselves in similar life circumstances to either character.  One of the best of 2003. 8/10",8,0,0,9 February 2004
Gone Baby Gone," Not bad, but it's no Mystic River.
","As I am federally mandated to point out, 'Gone Baby Gone' is the directorial debut of Ben Affleck, a fact that is impossible to overlook while watching the movie. Sometimes I wish I could watch a movie while completely ignorant of its director, but that's another post. Anyway, Affleck clearly cares about this crime drama, both in content and location, and his loving fingerprints mark the film with a unique raw edge.For a multitude of reasons, 'Gone Baby Gone' can succinctly be described as a light version of 'Mystic River', which was likewise based on a Dennis Lehane novel. The subject matter is equally heavy and thick, also exploring family dynamics through a painful crime involving a child. Both movies are set in Boston, and the one thing that 'Gone' does better, largely due to Affleck's devotion to his hometown, is capture the seedy bizarreness of the local culture. Beyond that, 'Gone' trails 'River' in every aspect, not to an extent that makes 'Gone' a poor film, but merely a decent one that does not remotely reach the great heights Clint Eastwood achieved four years ago.First, the story itself is weaker and more transparent, due in slight part to a bit of foreshadowing. The moral waters here are equally murky, but shallower once fully explored. Secondly, the cast is weaker; that's not so much a swipe at a solid troupe includes the always good Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris, but rather reminds how loaded River was with proved, veteran talent (Penn, Robbins, Bacon, Fishbourne, Linney, Harden). The younger faces here, like Casey Affleck, Michelle Monaghan, and (especially) Amy Ryan, acquit themselves well, but they do not possess the gravitas that can make such a film so much better. They are simply in a different league, the NFC versus 'River's' superior AFC. Similarly, Affleck's movie sports an effective rough look and a less effective uneven flow, as opposed to the smooth and polished texture of Eastwood fluid masterpiece. For a first film though, Affleck's end product is impressive and worth watching for fans of the genre.Bottom Line: Always decent, sometimes quite good, but it's nowhere near 'Mystic River'. 7 out of 10.",7,1,3,28 December 2007
The Bourne Ultimatum," I remember everything
","One of better movie series of the last decades possibly concludes with the release of 'The Bourne Ultimatum', the third movie that follows super-secret spy/assassin Jason Bourne as he attempts to track down his past against the wishes of the United States government that trained him. The original, 'The Bourne Identity', was one of the best pure action movie in recent years. The sequel, 2004's 'Bourne Supremacy', was unsure and not quite as polished, but still solid. Now comes the series third installment, which just about wraps up the summer movie season.The storyline follows a natural progression from the previous two movies. Now that Bourne has figured out who he is now and atoned somewhat for his sins, he wants to know who he was. In order to do that, he must race the government to various people who know the secrets behind his black-ops work.Few cinematic characters are as perfect for action movies as Jason Bourne, from both an action and narrative standpoint. As he learns his past, he takes the audience along for the ride. But that process is not tedious backstory or mediocre character development, as is often the case in such movies. Instead, his quest is the story, which makes for a rapid-fire flick that simultaneously entertains and enlightens. Matt Damon's determined yet understated demeanor is ideal for the role, and the no-frills approach never distracts from a driving story that is filled with plenty of high-tech action.In a lesser movie, the technological implausibilities might weaken the movie or distract from the storyline. But 'Ultimatum' dodged that bullet in two ways. First, the story moves quickly enough that the viewer barely has time to think about what might or might not work before the flick is on to the next frenetic sequence. Secondly, the movie does not use the technology as a dominant point of the movie, like 'Enemy of the State'. Instead the devices are merely a means to an end.Also overshadowing the technology is another strong supporting cast. The always-good Joan Allen returns this time, joined by Scott Glenn and David Straithairn, from 'Good Night and Good Luck'. Strathairn and Allen are compelling in every scene, particularly when they are together. Their exchanges crackle without flying over the top, and their restrained focus is as intense as any shouting match. They add a layer of gravity to the goings-on that separates 'Ultimatum' from other summer action like 'Live Free or Die Hard'.Other differences between this and 'Die Hard' lie in the technical aspects of the film. Director Paul Greengrass also helmed 'Supremacy', and he and his crew remedied one of the main problems of the second movie, which was the overly shaky camera work. Most of the shots are still hand-held, but they are more static than before and pulled back a little in the fights. The music is surprisingly good too. As Bourne trots through Europe and Africa, the music travels along, mixing in pulsing strings, African drums, and even going completely silent when appropriate.'Ultimatum' often echoes 'Identity', which is a good thing. Both possess a similar driving intensity interspersed with quiet moments that allow humanity to leak through. This one lacks the originality of 'Identity', but replaces it with the satisfying resolution that Bourne is seeking. On the whole, as the summer movie season wraps up, this is the best action film of the last few months. It's better than 'Die Hard', although it doesn't provide as much fun. It's a better film; 'Die Hard' is a better movie, if that makes sense.Bottom Line: Better than the second; not quite as good as the original, but still a bang-up way to end the summer movie season.

The Bourne Identity," Remember the original before you see the sequel.
","(Note: I haven't read the book, so I have no idea how the film compares.)**Minor Spoilers Ahead!**The 'Bourne Identity', based on Robert Ludlum's best-selling novel, tells the story of Jason Bourne, a black-ops agent working off the map for the United States government. When a mission goes awry, Bourne (Matt Damon) is left with a blank memory. As he follows the clues to reclaim his...uh...identity, Bourne runs into trouble with the authorities and teams up with Maria (Franka Potente), a transient young woman in whom he finds his only friend. As the two race around Europe, Bourne slowly rediscovers himself, while his supervisors in the U.S. attempt to track him down.The premise of 'Bourne Identity' is ideal to use a classic narrative technique: placing the audience in the shoes of a character. A la 'The Matrix', the protagonist here is completely ignorant. Therefore the world and story of the movie can be unfolded and explained without slowing the pace, because information new to the audience is also new to Bourne. When a second confused character (Maria) is introduced, that factor is doubled, permitting Bourne himself to introduce both parties to his knowledge of the espionage world. This method sucks the viewer into the story and creates a greater attachment than in a standard flick. Adding to the attraction of the film is Matt Damon's everyman appeal. Damon has never been an action hero, nor does he look a stereotypical beefy action star, along the lines of Schwarzenegger. But in this case the casting is perfect, because Bourne himself is uncomfortable in his own body. Damon nails the part by maintaining a paranoid state of mind with perpetually moving eyes and nervous gestures. The German-born Potente is another casting coup, as her unique appearance is a breath of fresh air, eschewing cookie-cutter American beauty for an earthier, healthier doe-eyed look that is refreshingly effective. With a supporting cast completed by such reliables as Chris Cooper, Clive Owen, and Brian Cox, the movie's acting is scarcely noticeable, which creates a 'believable' world of espionage.That world is a paranoid world, one that director Doug Liman ('Swingers'), cinematographer Oliver Wood ('Die Hard 2'), and crew represent on screen very well. Wood utilizes constantly moving, often hand-held, cameras, and the editing team of Saar Kline ('The Thin Red Line') & Christopher Rouse ('The Italian Job') features jumpy, nervous editing, all of which brilliantly emulate Bourne's fragile yet kinetic mental state. Speaking of 'The Italian Job', that's a decent comparison for 'Bourne Identity'. Although the latter is edgier and more complex, both have a European feel, with Bourne's obviously stemming from the entirely European setting. The old-fashioned yet physically beautiful locations are complemented by a rhythmic soundtrack that never soars but frequently hangs and lingers as the story proceeds. 'Bourne Identity' is classified as an action flick, but the action is decidedly different than that in other movies of the same genre. Containing very few special effects or CGI, the action centers on motion and pursuit, endowing the film with a edgier, more physical tone that is highlighted by a stellar car chase. Set in the middle of the movie, the sequence featuring a beat-up MG racing through the streets and alleys of Paris is the best cinematic chase since at least The Rock, if not long before that. The cat-and-mouse concept of the entire film is encapsulated in this quality set piece, which is more than just eye candy, serving also as a key turning point in the plot. With surprisingly little face-to-face conflict present, scenes like this one must infuse the story with suspense, and that they do very well. While developmental parts are naturally but enjoyably slower, an underlying tension drives the entire story. Because it often spontaneously explodes to life early, that possibility persists throughout, moving it along like a people-mover, at a slow and steady pace that doesn't seem dangerous until something goes wrong. Bottom Line: Rarely does an action-based movie feature such a compelling story and human characters. 8 of 10 for one of the most underrated and best action movies in recent years.",8,2,2,23 July 2004
The Italian Job," Good summer flick.
","**Warning! Slight Plot Spoilers Ahead!**'The Italian Job' is not the best movie you'll see all year, or probably even this summer. But it is a worthwhile two hours because it colors within the lines, knowing its limits and not attempting to exceed them.What carries the movie is the work of the cast.  In a movie about a crew of thieves, the individuals must have a good rapport with each other.  Without that cohesive feel, the audience doesn't believe in the characters collectively or individually, and the movie never has a chance.  But from the first scenes, in which the men joke around and rag on each other while infiltrating a Venetian palace, the proper chemistry is in place.
The characters themselves aren't anything novel; they're your basic gang of criminals, containing about half a dozen players, each with a specific and defining skill.  But each actor brings the proper goods to the table for his or her part.  Mark Wahlberg's understated acting and humor fits well with his part as the mastermind planner.  Edward Norton provides attitude and twirls his mustache well in his dark role.  Donald Sutherland is the father figure of the crew, and he looks the part of the suave and old-fashioned thief, who is still mentally spry.  Jason Statham, Seth Green, and Mos Def don't do much beyond their character's abilities, but they each nail those parts.  Statham as the smooth-operating driver; Green as the tech whiz geek with a chip on his shoulder; and Def as the demolitions man.  Charlize Theron slides in well in a part that doesn't ask too much of her.  She is primarily asked to to drive fast and look good.  That she does.  None of the characters are that deep or three-dimensional, but in this familiar sort of movie, two dimensions are all that is required.  As the title implies, the movie has a European feel to it, a la 'The Bourne Identity,' in part because it was shot on location in Venice, along with Philadelphia and Los Angeles.  Also contributing to the Euro flair is the rhythmic, bouncy music, which adds to the upbeat nature of the flick and complements the rapport of the cast.  The look of the movie is also a perfect match.  The bright colors of all locales enhance the mood and add to the attitude.  The Minis not only provide a fun variation on the car chase, but also work as a necessary plot device.  The plot is more or less straight-forward.  There are a few surprises, but they are more of the swift-and-smooth-turn variety, as opposed to the drop-your-jaw hairpin curve.  Even with those, the movie speeds  along. Once the foundation is laid by the first act, everything continuously progresses.  Thankfully there are no breaks in the action for a romance, something the movie wisely avoided.  There aren't even any breaks for 'real life.'  The story has its purpose and runs that course without distractions. The lack of character depth prevents 'The Italian Job' from being more than a good popcorn movie, but with all the complex details of the heist-planning, such superfluities would have dragged down the pace and quality of the flick.There are a number of implausibilities that I thought of both during and after viewing.  But the movie is so enjoyable that I didn't and don't care. In the real world, most of the movie probably couldn't have gone off that cleanly.  But 'The Italian Job' doesn't take place in the real world.  It occurs in a stylish and light-hearted criminal world that appeals to the rebel in all of us.  'The Italian Job' is a movie, in the true sense of the word.  It has no pretenses of Oscar and contains no deep moral message.  It provides pure escapism entertainment and does so quite well.Bottom Line: Maybe the best popcorn movie of the year so far.  7 of 10.",7,0,0,3 June 2003
The Matrix Revolutions," That's it?
","**WARNING! SPOILERS AHEAD!**(I avoid explicitly revealing most info, but I also make a number of vague references.)As one who loved the original 'Matrix,' I was obviously drooling over the release of two sequels this year. After seeing 'Reloaded' (which I thought very good as part one of two), I was awed by the action scenes and special effects, intrigued by the mechanics of the relationship between machines and men, and puzzled by exactly how everything would end up in the third film.'Revolutions' is an above average film, much like 'The Godfather, Part III' is an above average film. They both rode the coattails of their predecessors in that they took compelling characters in which people have vested interest and continued their lives through truly interesting events. But while 'Part III' ended in an inevitable manner that fit well, 'Revolutions' twists things in the last act, leaving viewers slightly uncomfortable with the result.If you've seen the first two, you know what the basic plot of 'Revolutions' is; you just don't know how it will be executed. The what is simple. The machines are trying to destroy the humans; Smith is trying to destroy Neo; the humans and Neo obviously object to those wishes. The how...aye, there's the rub. Chances are it doesn't occur as you anticipated.The reason is that in the first two movies, and for much of the third, the primary conflict presented is that between man and machines. Then in the last thirty minutes, that emphasis shifts abruptly to Neo versus Smith. Having been set up for a showdown between man and machines for over six hours of film, the final resolution was unsatisfying, particularly because our rooting interest is with the humans. I suppose that option is highly desirable in the face of the alternative, but it still left an aftertaste that was not bitter, but was definitely unwanted.Another core problem with 'Revolutions' is that the continual introduction of more characters means less screen time and development for those people we care about most (Neo, Trinity, Morpheus). After their initial trek into the Matrix, Trinity and Morpheus serve mostly as vessels for the rest of the flick. Trinity to drive and Morpheus to remind everyone to believe. Particularly as the movie resolves, too many of the characters' final moments are trite and tacked on out of necessity rather than purpose. You're telling me that after being the baddest movie chick since 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day,' Trinity goes out like that? Weak. Morpheus just smiles, nods, and hugs Niobe? Seriously folks, I think he might have been a wee bit excited upon seeing his lifelong beliefs fulfilled. Neo? I'm not even completely certain of his final fate. As someone who has invested many hours in these characters, that's extremely frustrating and unsatisfying.
But at the crux of my issues with 'Revolutions' lies a basic breakdown in narrative theory. A large part of what made 'Matrix' so popular was the way that the Wachowskis placed the audience in Neo's shoes, revealing information to them as it was revealed to him. This sucked the viewers in and made them feel more involved in the film. In Reloaded, the audience is placed primarily in the role of Morpheus. Since Neo has realized much of his abilities, we common folk relate more to Morpheus, especially as doubt creeps in about how the system works. His unshakable creedence in Neo parallels ours. We, like Morpheus, want him to triumph, kicking machine and Smith tail along the way. In 'Revolutions,' I don't see a character that fills that role. Link and his wife Zee fill the parts of commonfolk, but since neither is deeply developed, that doesn't work very well. Niobe is the human about whom we learn the most, and she is a strong and truly intriguing character. But we are still enlightened only to the soldier side of her, and she also eventually lapses into a predictable finish. This all adds up to a missing hook, without which getting into the film is more difficult.
Moving on to other aspects of the film...Although the characters aren't as easy to get into, the world definitely is, thanks to an again stellar production design, especially the colors. The earthy tones of Zion; the emerald hue of the Matrix; the sterile nature of the train station; and the grim and gray reality of the earth's surface. All of these places portray a vividly imaginative yet still plausible and fascinating world that is enhanced by cinematography containing typical Wachowski flair. Placing still and moving cameras at all angles, the brothers use a style grounded in simplicity, but not afraid to have fun. It reminds me of Spielberg's work on something like The Lost World, in which every few minutes, you get a fun shot that evokes a chuckle or smile.
Although the action doesn't seem as prevalent as in either predecessor, the three primary action scenes are excellent, at least on their own merits. The fight at the Merovingian's club is fully enjoyable; the last stand in Zion is epic in nature; and Neo's battle with Agent Smith also justly draws oohs and aahs. However none of the three appear as groundbreaking as the work in the two prequels. The club fight, although with the added dimension of ceiling walkers, is a small scale version of the government lobby scene. The largely computer generated war for Zion (but I don't remember once noticing blatant CGI) is unique and impressive for its scope and combatants, but was not all that different from a typical hold-the-fort scene. The Neo v. Smith fight is the most visually arresting action sequence. Utilizing creative combinations of light and shadow along with quality effects such as slow motion amidst the pouring rain, the Wachowskis once again craft splendid eye candy using state of the art visual effects and martial arts.The acting in 'Revolutions' is nothing special, but neither does it detract from the film. Of equal importance is that everyone looks their part exceptionally well. The script is what is different. While each of the first two films presented a variety of information, both philosophical and expository, this one eschews that in favor of a more traditional straightforward progression of action. Even though the dialogue scenes seemed to slow down Reloaded, those passages were missed here, as they added depth to the films, separating them from most common flicks.Bottom Line (elongated):  Despite my unbalanced list of deficiencies versus pluses, I honestly did enjoy this movie. However the end left me very unsatisfied, with an underwhelmed sense of 'That's it?' I walked out of the original completely infatuated with what I had just seen. I left Reloaded on a special effects high, eagerly anticipating the finale. But I departed Revolutions slightly disappointed and unsatisfied.(Side note: I still think Revolutions is a film that would have been above average on its own. In fact, I think the Wachowskis could have axed the Agent Smith stuff from the last two movies, altered the ending, and made a single more concise and satisfying movie. Then again, what do I know? But it has the misfortune of following a great film and a great appetizer. So while it is still a must see to finish the story, Revolutions is relegated to be an enjoyable and necessary but disappointing final episode in an epic trilogy.)",7,1,2,11 January 2004
Cast Away," Simply Stellar.
","**Warning! Spoilers Ahead!**While watching 'Cast Away,' the word that came to mind more than any other was 'right.'  Everything (except one thing) was done right, the way it should have been done.  From Hanks's metamorphosis to the unique ending, each decision of each character was perfect.  If you saw the trailer (which gave away entirely too much), then you know the basic storyline.  In the prelude, he nails the American obsession with work and time, and their conflict with relationships.  Then his plane crashes, and does so spectacularly.  Nothing is ordinary about how Robert Zemeckis shows the wreck.  He uses primarily interior shots, rather than the standard airplane-hurtling-from-the-sky visuals.  As perverse as it may sound, this is the best and most frightening plane crash I've ever seen on film.  The middle act features Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks) stranded on his island. This act is split into two distinct parts that are separated by four years. The first features Hanks merely adapting and surviving.  The second shows who and what Hanks has become, and how he has honed his survival skills. This transition dominates the film.  The only noise for an hour are the natural sounds and occasional Hanks dialogue.  How many actors can not only keep but demand your attention for sixty minutes w/o scarcely a word?  Hanks truly deserved another Oscar for his remarkable interaction with the island and Wilson, in manners both subtle and exuberant.  The cinematography here was marvelous, displaying both the magnificience and grittiness of the island simultaneously.  Finally he manages to escape, and after several dramatic encounters, including the nearly tear-inducing loss of Wilson, Hanks is discovered by a freighter.  That set the stage for what I was looking forward to, Hanks returning to civilization and adapting back to a different life.  I desperately wanted to see him experience the joy of a clean shower, brushing his teeth, or tasting food again.  But most of those scenes were never shown, and that's my singular complaint.  A few nods to this were seen, such as Hanks toying with the pocket knife, chugging the bottled water, and flicking on the lighter. I suppose my desired scenes would have extended the running time too long, but I still missed them.  The stage was then set for Noland's reunion with Helen Hunt's character, Kelly, who had essentially started a new life in the Hanks absence.  To continue a theme, this was done right.  In a lesser film, the two might have blissfully run off together into the sunset, but 'Cast Away' is smarter and more realistic than that.  While admittedly still in love, the two characters realize that they both must move on.  This is heart-breaking. There can't be much worse in life than knowing where your heart lies, but not being able to follow it because of something ludicrously random. 
The coda is perfect too.  Noland finds closure by delivering the package that kept him alive by providing hope, one of the most powerful feelings. Upon delivery and a chance encounter with the recipient, Noland ends his journey by standing at a literal and symbolic crossroads, not quite sure what's next.  Perfect, because that is precisely where he is at, physically and mentally and emotionally.Overall, so much is well done.Bottom Line: One of few films in which I have zero complaints regarding the characters' decisions.  Well written, made, and acted.  In a dead heat with 'Traffic' for the best film of 2000.  9 of 10.",9,1,1,20 March 2003
The Village," Good Night, but not great.
","M. Night Shyamalan has directed himself into a quandary. His first three mainstream films were all widely viewed and somewhat similar. Therefore, fair or not, he is pigeon-holed as a creator of a certain genre of film, specifically deliberately-paced, suspense-filled movies with twists in the closing moments. To his credit however, now that he has finished his first trilogy of films, he is moving on. Not out of his cinematic country, but at least into a different...er...'Village'. His latest work tells the story of a small community of people living in 1800s-era America. The villagers reside in a valley surrounded by a forest, where mysterious and dangerous creatures make their homes. The two species have reached a truce; the humans stay in the valley, and the animals remain in the woods. Violate those rules, and who knows what trouble may ensue. Once the worlds are established, certain situations potentially require help from the town beyond, which forces the humans to face their fear of the forest. Although most don't realize this, Shyamalan shied away from the surprise endings of 'The Sixth Sense' & 'Unbreakable' when he forged 'Signs', choosing instead to make revelations in the closing minutes. 'The Village' is the next progression, in which Shyamalan spreads the revelations throughout the film. A handful of such plot turns exist, some of which can be guessed, some of which can not. In the hands of a lesser director, that might be a problem. But Shyamalan is such a master at creating tension that even if you determine what is coming (as I did), he still entrances, turning your knuckles white as you cling to your seat. He does it using an entire arsenal of cinematic weapons. Editing (or lack thereof), acting, music, and most importantly in this film, framing. 'The Village' does not feature as many single-take scenes as his prior work, which actually causes the present ones to shine all the more (one between Joaquin Phoenix and Bryce Drew Howard in particular). Scenes like this give the audience a rare chances to see actors act, instead of watching numerous takes pieced together. As a solid veteran ensemble cast and with Howard an equally competent newcomer, the actors cruise through Shyamalan's Shakespeare-esque dialogue with a natural smoothness that overrides a script that could easily have felt stilted or pretentious. 'The Village' is cut more traditionally than Shyamalan's other work, but even the typical scenes, his visual flair emerges via unique angles and camera movements, complemented by James Newton Howard's music, which takes a more active role this time, eliciting jumps and nervousness as much as emphasizing them. But the framing is where Shyamalan has kicked everything up a notch. Along with veteran cinematographer Roger Deakins ('A Beautiful Mind', 'The Shawshank Redemption'), he time and again positions vital information just off-screen, thickening the tension by hesitating to reveal for an extra beat. That technique also parallels his story-telling strategy; Shyamalan unveils the premise of the movie over two hours, keeping you edgily involved as the visual and narrative anxiety drives the film forward in his trademark deliberate manner. The high technical achievement and solid acting cover up the weak link of 'The Village', which is the mildly compelling script. The words themselves, although old-fashioned, fully work in the colonial-esque setting. But the story simply is not as good or engaging as his prior writing. Due in part to a lack of the spiritual overtones that haunted his first three films, this one is not as intimate or personally absorbing. Also contributing to the deficiency is the larger cast. His earlier films concentrated on a handful of people; this one encompasses a wider swath of humans. Ergo, while the same (perhaps more) emotional intimacy exists, it is spread thinner, leaving the audience groping for whom to connect with. Without those themes and communion, the minimalistic acting that Shyamalan evokes from his thespians rings a tinge hollow, occasionally leaning toward vacant rather than pensive. With 'The Village', M. Night Shyamalan falls short of the very high bar he set for himself. Of course this is comparable to the New York Yankees having a bad season because they only reached the World Series. More well done than good, it is still an above average piece of filmmaking, and like his other pictures, one that is experienced rather than simply watched.
Bottom Line: A solid effort that should be experienced, but not quite up to Shyamalan's own standards. 7 of 10.",7,0,0,1 August 2004
Cold Mountain," Hookless.
","**Warning! Spoilers Ahead!**'Cold Mountain,' based on the best-selling novel, tells a love story set in the South against the backdrop of the Civil War. Inman (Jude Law) plays a Confederate soldier who abandons his comrades to return to the woman he loves, Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman). Meanwhile back at the ranch, Ada has enlisted the help of mountain woman Ruby Thewes (Renee Zellweger) to survive.Right off the bat, therein lies the problem; the story that is intended to propel the film doesn't fulfill its purpose or promise. The first act love tale between the characters of Jude Law and Nicole Kidman isn't developed into a convincing relationship. Thus, without the necessary screen time or situations for the two to truly fall in love, the film has the unfortunate feel of a typical teenage romance, in which the two lovers fall for each other in a ridiculously short amount of time, based largely on looks and infatuation. The entire plot is based upon that hook, which provides each character with motivation to keep on keeping on. Rendered hook-less, 'Cold Mountain' still looks great, but doesn't engage as great movies do, instead plodding along through the first hour.Then Ruby shows up, infusing 'Cold Mountain' with the vitality it desperately needed. Zellwegger, continuing her remarkable run of stellar role choices, effectively provides the comic relief while remaining entirely within her character as a woman well-acquainted with the physical and emotional hardships of life. Despite being the less attractive of the two female leads, she maintains a magnetism that outshines even Kidman's strong acting chops. Zellwegger will likely earn an Oscar nomination and completely deserves such an honor.The rest of the cast ranges from solid but not spectacular (Law and Kidman) to surprisingly good (several stars in unusual roles). But the most entertaining aspect of the film was the long list of highly recognizable faces in minor roles. Many people will notice six or more 'names' in parts that are slightly more than cameos, along with another half dozen faces that will be familiar to regular movie-goers. All of these actors turn in very good supporting work that colorfully fills in the background of the film.
That background, both on the screen and behind the scenes, may very well garner a basketful of Academy Award nods, and while I would dispute other acting nominations and any screenwriting award, I acknowledge the technical quality of the film. In his director role, Anthony Minghella ('The Talented Mr. Ripley,' 'The English Patient') has produced a quality presentation of a sprawling book, but as I have said, I point the finger at his adaptation, which failed to adequately evoke emotional involvement in the romantic aspects.With Romania largely filling in for the South, John Seale (Oscar winner for 'English Patient,' 'Witness') lenses a good-looking film, and that beauty contrasts starkly with the often excessive violence on screen. Composer Gabriel Yared, another Minghella favorite, again takes a relatively minimalistic approach, similar to his score for 'Possession,' mixing Southern strains with typical film music to complement the film well. The score doesn't stand out like many of the year's dramatic work, but that's not a bad thing.Bottom Line: The film doesn't live up to its hype. When a movie aims high and misses, it often falls below what might have been had it aimed lower and succeeded. That is the case with Cold Mountain; although signs of brilliance were evident, one glaring off note holds the movie back at all times. A marginal thumbs up at best. 6/10",6,1,1,18 January 2004
Little Miss Sunshine," Probably the best comedy of 2006.
","Comedies about families usually come in one of two genres. Often featuring dysfunctional families (are those two words redundant?), they are either broad and goofy ('Cheaper by the Dozen') or dark and abstruse ('The Royal Tenenbaums'). Driving its Volkswagon bus down the middle of these two extremes is 'Little Miss Sunshine', a comedy both inclusive and exclusive, one that some will get entirely, while others will whiff on to the same degree.The title stems from a beauty pageant in which seven-year old Olive (Abigail Breslin of 'Signs') competes. For a good portion of the film, the contest serves as a MacGuffin of sorts, putting an already odd mix of family members on the road in bizarre situations that call Vegas Vacation to mind.But 'Sunshine' is far more than the slapstick of 'Vacation'. It mixes humor both broad and subtle humor into a strange brew of comedy, poignancy, lessons, and life. Huge and deep issues are addressed, topics like death, dreams, and failure. Yet somehow the movie doesn't feel heavy. You'll walk out with a smile on your face because the movie sensibly touches on these issues, realizing that stuff happens and life continues, that the handling of adversity is often what defines people. And above all, there is family, which you're stuck with, for better and worse.'Sunshine' may not grab you right away, which is part of its power. It burns slowly, introducing the family members to the viewing outsiders through observation, then putting the viewers in the bus with them as they enter a foreign world. All this is done without lapsing into melodrama and without losing steam as the movie chugs toward the climactic final scene, continuously building momentum along the way, before promptly getting out on top.Rather crude at times, 'Sunshine' is not a movie for children, nor is it for anyone who takes life or movies too seriously. But if you excel at finding the askance humor in life and film, then you will relish this offbeat look at a collection of family dynamics perhaps only slightly stranger than most, although definitely more extreme.Bottom Line: One of the year's best, and likely its best comedy. 8 of 10.",8,135,202,9 December 2006
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Enjoy the ride...again.
","**Warning! Mild Spoilers Ahead!**'T-3' is a straightforward picture, setting the stage in the opening twenty minutes, then propelling its characters into what is basically a chase movie for the final hour and a half. Sound familiar? Well, why mess with success? Although it may sound boring and routine, the movie is neither. The script and pacing are both tight and constantly in motion, leaving no time for boredom.The plot of 'T-3' is pretty much the same as that of its predecessors. The machines have sent a new and improved terminator, in this case a stunning T-X played by the smokin' Kristanna Loken, back in time from the future to kill someone who will eventually lead the humans in their fight against the machines. Naturally the humans also managed to sneak back their own terminator, albeit an older model, the T-800. This is of course Arnold Schwarzenegger (although not the same robot as in T-2), and he must prevent the T-X from accomplishing her mission.What separates 'T-3' from lighter summer fare such as 'Pirates' or 'The Italian Job' is the effective philosophy. While not quite up to the high standard of 'T-2' or 'The Matrix', it still churns the mind with its issues of fate and time travel. Go ahead, try to completely figure out how a machine from the future can go back in time to affect events that ultimately create the machine itself. Despite the density, every event that takes place makes perfect sense both within the movie and within the trilogy.
Schwarzenegger is once again at his best, as the simple-minded and stoic T-800. He slides easily back into the character, and even at age 56 is still a perfect physical and vocal fit. Some say that the role doesn't demand much of Arnold, but perhaps he does it so effortlessly that we don't notice. Either way, seeing him back at the top of his acting game is a pleasure, after such mediocre fare as 'Collateral Damage' and 'The 6th Day'.
Nick Stahl, no longer 'In the Bedroom', fits into the part of a twenty-something John Connor with ease. He provides Connor with the proper world-weariness and gives him grounded logic and street smarts that befit someone who has grown up under his unusual circumstances.
Loken, much like Robert Patrick in the second movie, doesn't get to display much versatility, but her icily gorgeous eyes and facial features combine with appropriate body movements to supply the T-X with a chilly and imposing aura. She's not quite as fearsome as Patrick, perhaps because she's female; but her character's unstoppable nature is enough to compensate for that.
Claire Danes, in a role that one might not expect to find her, is Kate Brewster. She happens upon Connor at her veterinary clinic, and is properly naive, much like Neo in 'The Matrix', as she gets sucked into the tidal wave of action and adventure. The rest of the actors, in mostly little-developed parts, are sufficient to round out the cast.The comedy in 'T-3' was an unexpected enjoyment. Much of it was derived from Schwarzenegger's machine mind failing to comprehend various aspects of humanity, verbal and otherwise. Arnold's classic monotone delivery is perfect, both in tone and timing. Other comedic sources included a number of references to the prior films. Some are obvious ('She'll be back'); some are less so (the reappearing shrink). But they are all amusing, providing necessary comic relief for a movie that could easily have been overbearing and overly serious. One other amusing theme is the one-upmanship involved in various stunts and chase scenes. Things just keep getting bigger, and I couldn't help but laugh. 'T-3' wasn't bust-a-gut funny, but it consistently induced chuckling from the audience in a number of ways.
One of the joys of 'T-3' is the physicality of the stunt and fight sequences. Because of the virtual immortality of the two terminators, brutal acts of violence are necessary when fighting them, acts that can't be done to normal humans. There's something painfully (sadistically?) enjoyable about watching someone bashing a foe with a just-ripped-off-the-wall urinal, or seeing a truck slam straight into a building. I found myself constantly wincing, but also grinning at the same time. Seeing someone get the crap beat out of them while knowing the characters won't actually be injured is surprisingly, perhaps frighteningly, engrossing. Additionally, those scenes appear to be mostly stuntwork, not CGI. Contrasting the highway chase scene in 'Matrix Reloaded', which is gloriously sleek and jaw-dropping, the car chase in 'T-3' is brutal and punishing. In a cinematic time that favors heavy reliance on computer imagery, that honest physicality in stuntwork is extremely refreshing.This is a movie that should be seen on the big screen, preferably one with a high quality surround sound system. The theater I patronized was unfortunately lacking in the aural department, as the audio was front-heavy. But I still appreciated the sound. Without being overly loud, the sound effects did their job quite well, providing the proper noises at the proper times. The score was not very noticeable, which means that composer Marco Beltrami did his job suitably. Somewhat surprisingly, the recognizable Terminator theme of Brad Fiedel did not surface until the end of the movie (unless I missed it).The other reason I recommend the theater experience is the bigness of the flick.  Like its prequels, 'T-3' is simply a large movie. Arnold is big; various vehicles are big; themes are big; everything is done on a grand scale. Plus the picture looks good. With machines as a primary subject, the film is conducive to a slick appearance, and cinematographer Don Burgess ('Cast Away', 'Bourne Identity') delivers a gleaming final cut.
If you haven't seen the first two renditions, you'll definitely miss out on some of the jokes, and won't have a full understanding of everything discussed, but you can still enjoy the film. I recommend seeing the other two first, but it's not entirely necessary. The presence of Kate, also a newbie to the world of terminators, allows John Connor and the T-800 to explain much of the backstory without seeming dry. Taking a cue from the original, most of the exposition wisely occurs on the run, so it doesn't slow the movie down, but rather fills in the blanks of the plot while still moving forward.Not comparing 'T-3' to its predecessors is impossible. This one isn't quite as cultish as the first, nor as dark or ground-breaking as the second. However 'T-3' is still a thoroughly worthy and engaging finale (?) to the series.Bottom Line: The issue of fate combined with the spectacular action sequences make this an above average flick. Terminator fans should be pleased too. Worth a big screen viewing and surprisingly enjoyable. Three of four stars for now.  Maybe more as it grows on me.",7,0,0,27 July 2003
Van Helsing," The summer movie onslaught has begun.
","'Van Helsing' tells the story of the titular character (Hugh Jackman), who serves the Vatican as a sort of black ops agent whose missions are to eradicate various unrepentant monsters. His primary task here is to destroy the horrific triumvirate of Count Dracula (Richard Roxburgh), Wolfman, and Frankenstein's monster. With his own medieval Agent Q (LOTR's David Wenham), our hero ventures to Transylvania to team up with the stunning Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale), the last survivor in a noble family that must kill Dracula or be condemned forever to purgatory.Although I think the makers of 'Van Helsing' tried to inject a dose of heart their work, they still produced little more than a good summer popcorn movie, and I don't mean that as an insult. Director Stephen Sommers also helmed 'The Mummy' and its sequels, and while I would rate Van Helsing ahead of those movies, it is cast from the same mold. If you go in with expectations of greatness, you'll no doubt hate it and be utterly disappointed. But if you settle in looking for nothing more than 2+ hours of fun, nearly campy entertainment, you'll be thoroughly satisfied.
A large reason that it falls short of being even a good movie is the derivative nature of the entire flick. Although set in a dark neo-Victorian age (in which it always seems to be raining), 'Van Helsing' contains countless scenes that bring to mind various classics. Whether it be Van Helsing's Batman-esque tools, his gadget room borrowed from James Bond, shots taken from Looney Tunes, or a scene straight out of 'Get Smart' (yes, that's right), so much of the movie has been done before. More than any other, Van Helsing imitates The Indiana Jones Trilogy in ways ranging from the hero's attire to how certain characters die to the use of a map to display travel. Even Alan Silvestri's music recalls one of Indy's secondary themes. While this derivative nature prevents 'Van Helsing' from being a truly good film, it does provide a alternative unique form of entertainment. Half the fun of the movie is pinpointing the pervasive cinematic references.
The other half of the fun comes from the overall appearance and content. While these well-known characters have been portrayed on the screen hundreds of times through the years, rarely are they seen so vividly in an action movie such as this. Jackman possesses a perfect look for the swashbuckling protagonist; Roxburgh not only twirls his mustache well, but does add some humanity to the blood-sucking count. Beckinsale, in a role not all that different from her turn in Underworld, isn't asked to do much but look vengeful and beautiful, and does just that, managing to fight ferociously in tight clothes while still maintaining her gorgeous and pristine appearance. Wenham, in stark contrast to his noble Faramir, fills the thankless comic relief role, and does so rather well, considering what he is given to work with.The rest of the cast consists primarily of minor roles or special effects. Unfortunately while the physical appearance of the movie is excellent, the visual effects aren't always up to par. They're not bad, but also aren't quite seamless with the rest of the flick. Every once in a while something doesn't quite match or feels just a little too fake. With so many effects done by many different effects houses, perhaps this was inevitable, but the minor discrepancies are still occasionally distracting, which is the one thing that visual effects should not be.The effects are not helped by the fact that the movie, at nearly two and a half hours, is twenty minutes too long. As enjoyable as the various people and fights are, one can only take so much of horror characters scurrying around doing battle. Trimming a few minutes out of about every scene would have made the remaining excitement that much more enjoyable, resulting in a more streamlined and bearable picture. As it is, everything drags on too long, permitting what could have been a taut adventure film to unravel into a messier and less cohesive movie.As the movie that kick-starts the summer season, 'Van Helsing' receives some leeway. Had it been released in August, it probably wouldn't have been nearly as enjoyable, following a summer of similarly action-packed but largely forgettable fare. But with cinematic tastebuds longing for fresh popcorn after a stale spring, Van Helsing survives its shortcomings to provide a satisfying if short-lived treat.Bottom Line: Decent summertainment, at least as the first biggie of the season.  6/10, for fun as much as quality.",6,0,0,13 May 2004
Collateral," A slick & mature thriller.
","From director Michael Mann comes 'Collateral', the single night story of a hit-man and a taxi driver, who serves as both hostage and chauffeur. The film is highly reminiscent of 'Heat', also helmed by Mann. Fortunately Mann learned from some of his earlier mistakes, crafting a tighter, more personal picture. The film is rife with Mann's touches, ranging from hues to cues. Set in urban Los Angeles, the lighting and locations effectively reflect the multi-ethnic night scene, as the entire movie is infused with a blue tint (see: 'Heat', 'The Insider'), adding to the Mann's usual mellow yet driving feel that aids in distinguishing 'Collateral' from most cinema. The soundtrack features the fully competent music of James Newton Howard ('Unbreakable'), but the other musical choices are the highlights. Utilizing jazz to classical, as well as the usual dramatic score, the music lounges well in the background, providing a truly appropriate soundtrack to scenes that range from quiet dialogue to brutal action. Through that variety of scenes, 'Collateral' develops characters and story in a parallel manner rather than opt for the common needlessly breakneck stories that substitute action for plot and character depth. After a well-paced introduction accompanied by classical music, Vincent (Tom Cruise) hops into the taxi of Max (Jaime Foxx). One stop later, as the music kicks it in gear, the game is afoot. The two progress through Vincent's list of terror, and they get to know each other. Instead of defining the characters with an opening sequence or two, then hurling them into a chaotic series of events, 'Collateral' develops both Vincent and Max to the very last scene. The audience learns about both Vincent and Max as the duo learns about each other, resulting in a compelling, Heat-esque battle of wills between the characters and a viewer's decision about whom to root for.Given the characters' professions, that choice may seem easy, but for at least two reasons, a legitimate dilemma exists. First of all, it's Tom Cruise, here playing an atypical role for him; plus his Vincent is not a traditional baddie. An evil man, yes, but one who convincingly believes his profession is no different than any other; he sincerely thinks he is doing right. As Hitler proved (pardon the extreme comparison), these are the most dangerous type of evil people, because they possess no remorse and no hesitation. In 'Collateral' such an antihero interacts crisply with Jaimie Foxx's character. As Vincent's foil, Max is far from a normal protagonist, and Foxx plays him unexpectedly well as a day-dreaming, underachieving hack stuck in the same rut for a dozen years. With the character traits of the hero and antagonist switched thusly, the story confuses rooting interests yet engages the mind, dragging a willing audience along for an introspective roller-coaster. In more than one sense, the simple plot brings to mind last year's 'Phone Booth', in that the morally questionable main characters are largely confined to a small space, and the pic is basically a mano-a-mano experience. But while 'Phone Booth' had Colin Farrell battling an unseen threat, Mann blatantly presents the opposing forces, whether they be physical or mental obstacles. This is a more difficult conflict to express well, but 'Collateral' successfully presents the strife, thanks to superb performances from cast and crew. But despite their noblest efforts, a total lack of redeeming character values does fetter the film from fulfilling a greater glory. Over the last twenty minutes, 'Collateral' unfortunately but unsurprisingly lapses into convention but still serves as a thinking man's thriller. You won't find mindless entertainment like 'S.W.A.T.' here, but something akin to Michael Mann's previous work, in a more compact package.Bottom Line: Very enjoyable, and a good change of pace from summer tripe.

Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Exhilarating to the last shot.
","'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban' ('PoA') is a story identical in structure to the first two books/films. Harry makes a narrow escape to Hogwarts, where he is soon at the center of a complicated mystery. With the help of best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, he resolves to unravel the perplexity, which leads to a dramatic and mesmerizing final act.'PoA' is in a unique and tricky position for a literary sequel because not only will it be inevitably compared with the book, but because of a directorial change, the film will be more heavily contrasted with its predecessors. Fortunately Alfonso Cuaron (best known for Y Tu Mama Tambien, pardon the lack of accent marks) has helmed the best film of the series, even though it is the least similar to the source material.While Chris Columbus turned in workmanlike efforts in the first two movies, his primary error was in remaining too faithful to the text, resulting in too much content that slowed down the pacing. Conversely Cuaron has chiseled away at the third book (which is longer than the first two, although the film is shorter) to create his own handiwork that is faithful to the spirit of Rowling's writing, while clearly featuring his own artistic style.That style is what makes 'PoA' so enjoyable to watch, even if, perhaps especially if you've read the book, as I have. Instead of simply waiting to see how the director's vision matched up with my own, I found myself eagerly anticipating not only the what but the how, as Cuaron's transitions, shots, and camera movements injected new life into the series. The Mexican featured wider and longer shots than most American directors, endowing Hogwarts with a different feeling, one more open and less ominous. His transitions also stood out, in contrast to Columbus' straightforward manner. Many vignettes opened or closed with stylish scene-setting shots, whether it be a freezing flower or a bird veering too close to the Whomping Willow. These transitions meshed with a more subdued color palette to give the film more of a human feel, reflecting the tumultuous times that the main characters were enduring. They also allowed the drama to build, which was important in a film that contained so many vignettes that could easily have felt much more unrelated. The humane aspect of 'PoA' may be the core enhancement to the series. Cuaron's technical alterations aid this development, as does the maturation of the three children, both as characters and actors. Being clearly older, Harry, Hermione, and Ron have grown past the cute child actor stage and reached the teenage plateau, which for makes them easier to relate with for most of the audience. Additionally the trio is outfitted in normal clothes, rather than their school uniforms, much more often. Not everyone remembers what it was like being a preppy little kid, but everyone recalls life as a jeans-wearing teenager. The physical aspects would possibly be enough, but also the script contains more and better emotions, the three actors are better at portraying them, and the director is better at displaying them. That's a Murderer's Row of improvements that is impossible to overlook.Consistent with the first two films, the adult actors are stellar once more. >From Alan Rickman's permanent sneer as Snape to Maggie Smith's world-weary wisdom as Professor McGonagall to Robbie Coltrane's now-promoted-to-faculty Hagrid, all of the returnees slide effortlessly back into their parts. They are complemented by an equally talented group of newcomers. Michael Gambon performs admirably with the impossible task of replicating Richard Harris' gravitas, combining Harris' established character with his own interpretations. As the latter titular character, a frenetic Gary Oldman is deliriously watchable once he finally makes an appearance. Last but definitely not least is David Thewlis as R.J. Lupin, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor. He expertly works with Harry to supply several tender exposition scenes that don't slow down the movie. All in all, the adult cast shines as they relish their roles without chewing scenery.Special effects were at the center of the first two films, but in 'PoA' they largely take a backseat to traditional dialogue scenes. That allows the fewer primary visual effects (not to be confused with the numerous background paintings, etc.) to range from solid to superb. Buckbeak looks perfect, while the Dementors quality tattered look will suffer from comparisons to the superior Ringwraiths of 'LOTR'. But due to sheer originality, the Knight Bus tops them all in an early thrill ride. Good stuff as usual from Industrial Light & Magic. Speaking of reliable technicians, John Williams has composed yet another excellent score. With the choral song Something Wicked This Way Comes, Williams has added another lingering tune to his already familiar work, allowing him to weave both themes throughout the film. The guy's a machine, and while he does occasionally produce some melodramatic scores, this is not one of them. Its tinges of darkness and minor keys (?) accurately mirror the action, soaring and subsiding as needed. Lest you think the movie was the greatest film ever, I should point out that because Cuaron trimmed so much from the book, the numerous scenes sometimes feel rushed and truncated, as though we are dashing through a museum in an effort to see everything as quickly as possible. The truncation did not bother me because I knew the omitted information, but the pace was too choppy over the middle portion of the film. I could also argue that if you haven't seen the others or read the books, then you won't fully understand everything, as characters and skills aren't entirely explained. But that's a minor complaint, because will anyone actually see this one who hasn't seen or read the others? Like it or not, 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban' is clearly the most cinematic of the first three movies. Rather than simply churn out a live-action version of the book, director Alfonso Cuaron utilized tools like telescopic fades, zooms through clock towers, and additional character development as he adapted the book to fit the big screen. The result is a emotionally darker film with more humanity than the first two combined.Bottom Line: 'PoA' was the best film I've seen so far this year. Thoroughly enjoyable to the last shot.

Ratatouille," Pixar does it again, for everyone.
","'Ratatouille' is the latest computer-animated release from Pixar, the company that has produced the best animated films over the last decade. The odd title is the name of vegetable stew and doubles as a pun on the main character, a rat named Remy.Remy is no ordinary rat though. He resides in France amidst a colony that lives as rats do, thriving on the garbage and remnants of others, Remy is the exception because he has a finely-honed sense of smell and loves cooking. Through a series of fortunate events, Remy finds himself in Paris at a fine restaurant, where he learns how to interact with a kitchen boy named Linguini to create magnificent meals. Things of course get complicated, as Remy attempts to balance his passion with his family, and Linguini must handle being a celebrity through no talent of his own, while dealing with a sinister restaurant critic.Like all of Pixar's work, 'Ratatouille' looks phenomenal. The rats in particular look good, with fine detail paid to fur in various states. The humans are not the most hyper-realistic creations seen on screen, but neither are they intended to be. This is a cartoon, and the artists seem to know that, because most of the characters border on caricature. The slimy French chef is ridiculously short and sports a pencil-line mustache. The critic has long and angular features that scream evil. Even though the movie is made with the most modern of technology, it is a throwback to the classic days of Disney and Looney Tunes, when merely a glance at a character would explain everything about a character. The bad guys look bad; the good guys are goofy but likable, and the gray characters share attributes of both, leaving the viewer guessing for a while.One thing that separates 'Ratatouille' from most of its Pixar brethren is the pervasive kinetic energy. Plenty of other movies, like Cars and The Incredibles, were drenched with action and movement, but it feels different here because the scope of the movie is centered on a rat. When you watch Remy race through a kitchen or up a building from close-up, it feels much wilder and more dangerous than watching a human make the same thirty-foot trek, which is appropriate since it is more hazardous for a rat to make that trip.The question about all Pixar movies is twofold: how well does it play with kids, and how well does it play with adults? I suspect that Ratatouille may not be as accessible to kids as most of the rest of the Pixar library, because many of the characters are rats. Rodents are not as marketable or over-the-top memorable as a giant furry blue monster or an innocent little clown fish. Nor is the story quite as simple as some others. But the pace is brisk enough, and the story is understandable enough, thanks in large part to the brilliant animation, that kids should still enjoy the movie. Adults should enjoy it too, with the fine images, clever humor, and various twists and turns of the story. On the whole, 'Ratatouille' is not as memorable as 'Finding Nemo' or either 'Toy Story', but it is good enough to be tucked right behind them with 'Monster's Inc.' Bottom Line: 7 of 10 for the best family film of the summer. What the heck, call it 8 of 10.",9,3,5,4 August 2007
No Country for Old Men," What's the most you ever lost on a coin toss?
","'No Country for Old Men' is a not an over-hyped blockbuster movie. If you have seen the trailer, you probably thought it looked rather strange. You would be right, but in a wonderful way.The movie is difficult to pigeonhole, but the story, set in 1980 in rural Texas, is fairly straightforward. Josh Brolin plays Llewelyn Moss, a rugged native who stumbles across a deserted murder scene where he discovers and absconds with a case full of money. From that point on, two men head up two very different methods of pursuit. Tommy Lee Jones is small town sheriff Ed Tom Bell (phenomenal name), who is trying to figure out what happened. Javier Bardem, whom you might recognize from 'The Sea Inside' or a small role in 'Collateral', is a ferociously single-minded individual who has been hired by less than scrupulous people to track down the missing cash.The movie is directed by the Coen Brothers, who have put together high quality offbeat films like 'O Brother Where Art Thou', 'Fargo', and 'Blood Simple'. In those movies and many of their others, the brothers combine familiar movie elements into a single amalgam that defies being defined as a single genre. With 'No Country for Old Men', they have done the same thing, creating a movie that might be best described as a neo-western. Its deliberate pace, scenic framing, and South Texas location call to mind classic westerns. The tagline for the movie is that 'There are no clean getaways,' which implies that this is a heist movie. There are parts of that genre, and there are major components of a chase picture, all tweaked to fit the technologically crude era of 1980.Now, that's the setup, but is this offbeat movie any good? The critics sure think so. Plenty of critics societies have already named this the best picture of 2007, including groups from from New York, Chicago, Boston, Dallas, D.C., and the National Board of Review. It's also probably the current favorite to win the Best Picture Oscar, for praiseworthy reasons that are easy to spot and completely justified.The three lead performances have grabbed the headlines, and understandably so. Javier Bardem is absolutely terrifying in his atypical villainous role. There is no gimmicky mask or superpower, just pure evil. With merely a look or a stride, he exudes menace, more force of nature than mere bad guy. He is a bad dude, both fantastic and frightening. Because Bardem is so good, he overshadows Josh Brolin, who disappears into his self-confident Texas denizen, playing the chasee with a confidence that makes him an excellent anti-hero. Tommy Lee Jones is stellar as usual. He embodies a world-weary sheriff with one of the best combinations of drawl and lingo that you will ever hear. His drawl is accompanied by a script that is taken in large part directly from the book on which the film is based. The words are rife with a vernacular that could not be more perfect, eliciting grins from the viewer with both their humor and suitability. Even when you don't know what is said, you know precisely what it means. Of these three turns, Bardem has won many awards already, and will almost certainly be nominated for and win an Academy Award. Even though Brolin and Jones have not yet received many accolades, both are worthy of such honors; the problem being that that they are frequently eclipsed by Bardem's chilling portrayal.Due to the magnetic acting of the leads and the character actors, who are great as they look and sound as though they have spent their entire lives baking in the dry heat near the Mexican border, the movie is extremely compelling despite a deliberate pace and almost no background music during its two-hour running length. Most chase-type movies are fast-paced and action-packed, leaving little time for suspense to grow; this is the opposite. There are no quick-cutting action scenes, but instead heart-pounding scenes that slowly ramp up the tension. Those intense parts are complemented by quieter scenes of conversation or investigation that maintain a foreboding dramatic undertone of upcoming conflict. While the film loses some of its building momentum late in the story, and the denouement does not quite match the brilliance of the preceding hundred minutes, the closing moments remain appropriate for a movie that doesn't offer any easy questions or answers.All in all, this is a movie that is definitely worthy of the countless honors that it is receiving from critics across the country. Assuming the writer's strike doesn't waylay the Oscars, I suspect that this will be the front-runner for Best Picture, and I'd bet a good chunk of money that Bardem will snag a Best Supporting Actor trophy. His performance and the film on the whole stand out from the year's crowd and are worth seeing, not for the popcorn movie crowd, but for fans of good, well-crafted cinema and story-telling.Bottom Line: One of the best of the year. 8 of 10.",8,0,6,28 December 2007
Batman Begins," The best Batman film yet.
","As the title hints, 'Batman Begins' is not a sequel to the three (the latest previous attempt doesn't count) recent installments featuring the Caped Crusader, but rather a new dawn that unabashedly ignores any established precedents. The end result is as intended, breathing brilliant new life into a series that had unfortunately become a laughingstock.The script's blueprint invigorates the film. Because of the audience's general familiarity with the title character, 'Batman Begins' is able to concentrate on his origin and motivations rather than the crime fighting itself. Like 'Superman', the best superhero movie ever, the film spends a significant portion of its running length on the how and why instead of the what. We observe the fears and struggles that Bruce Wayne faces, which simultaneously humanizes him and heightens his mythic status.This course of action is primarily executed over the first ninety minutes, during which a depth beyond the typical perfunctory introduction of motives is established. Batman's fearsome aura, the source of his power in both the fictional world of Gotham and the real world of moviegoers, is detailed, resulting in a movie more fascinating psychological thriller than standard adventure flick, although the action scenes still shine, one Batmobile-charged chase in particular. Eventually of course the inevitable protagonist-antagonist showdown evolves, and then the movie deteriorates slightly, but by that point 'Batman Begins' has reached such heights that neither the slight come-down nor occasional cinematic conveniences and niceties (why the kid?) derail the picture.Aiding in the climb to excellence is the best supporting cast of any Batman film, filled with respected and recognizable faces who nail roles as they suitably show more restraint than many in the prior versions. Cillian Murphy is extra creepy as the the shady psychologist Dr. Crane; Liam Neeson authoritative as Ducard, Bruce Wayne's mentor; Gary Oldman, even though you half-expect him to go psycho at any moment, evokes an excellent world-weariness as Detective Gordon; Michael Caine adds strength to the butler Alfred; and Morgan Freeman as Batman's pseudo-Q is...well, has Freeman ever been anything less than superb? Other talented actors like Tom Wilkinson (crime boss Carmine Falcone), Ken Watanabe (the enigmatic Ra's Al Ghul), and Rutger Hauer (the business head of Wayne Enterprises) round out the predominantly male cast interestingly loaded with Brits. As the mandatory female love interest, Mrs. Tom Cruise...er...Katie Holmes, is fully adequate and attractive, although her part could have been played by numerous actresses.All that talent matters little if the man behind the cape and cowl falters. But Christian Bale never wavers in either portion of his role. I'll say it...Bale is better than Keaton, Kilmer, or Clooney, combining the best of the two former actors. As Bruce Wayne, he surpasses Keaton's charming playfulness and Kilmer's suave businessman with a twinkle befitting the younger man. As Batman, Bale possesses a masked intensity that blows away all of them, embodying the tortured soul through menacing facial expressions and a daunting physical presence that none of his predecessors maintained consistently.Beyond an omnipresent score (from Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard) that is unrelenting but still mostly unobtrusive, a solid script and high production value lay the foundation from which the aforementioned excellent work is built. With the feel of a ridiculously polished (as it should be for $135 million) independent film, the Chicago-based Gotham City is edgier and darker than 'Batman Forever', but grittier than Tim Burton's noir-ish films. Those were bleak by design, while Batman Begins seems to draw its bleakness from beyond mere physicality, from a hope-starved story that matches its dismal yet chimerical backdrop. Instead of the fact-based world of Spider-man and his New York City, Batman and his Gotham sport a fantasy-laced makeover that better allows for distinctions between good and evil. While moral murkiness fits some films ('Mystic River'), superhero flicks work best with clear-cut distinctions. By creating a city with a sense of elevated reality, director Christopher Nolan and company imbue 'Batman Begins' with a stronger soul that thrives on the film's dominant theme of fear, compounding the movie's allure.All aspects collectively tap into the mysterious and powerful Batman myths better than any other movie in the franchise. We now know not just who and what Batman is, but how and why he exists.Bottom Line: 'Batman Begins' is the best on-screen incarnation of the Dark Knight yet. A high 8 of 10.",8,2,2,21 June 2005
Blue Crush," Watchable.
","**Warning! Mild Spoilers Ahead!**'Blue Crush' takes the sports movie formula, throws in a cup of romance and a dash of family strife, and cooks up a movie that is watchable, but not really that good.  The basic problem is that virtually nothing in the story is original.  While some sports movies can get away with that due to compelling characters or powerful performances (like 'Rocky', of which this movie is reminiscent), 'Blue Crush' is not one of those.  The characters and plot lines are cliche, and the actors, who don't have much to work with, are simply servicable. 
When the movie is on dry land, it plods.  None of the ashore scenes are very interesting; they merely fill time between surf sequences, for which I found myself impatiently waiting, without enhancing the driving storyline.The visually arresting surfing scenes are indisputably the highlights of 'Blue Crush.'  Director John Stockwell put cameras just about everywhere in, around, and under the water.  Those innovative shots provide the best visuals of the movie, expertly and vividly portraying a you-are-there sensation of surfing.  The surf culture was explained well too, from the local thoughts of tourists to the comaraderie of the competitors.  The only problem with the surf scenes was that they sometimes felt pieced together (and they probably were), particularly during the announcer's voice-overs at the final contest.Bottom Line: 'Blue Crush' is the essence of a guilty pleasure movie.

The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Best film of 2002.
","**Warning!  Mild Spoilers Ahead!**There are a handful of issues I have with this movie.  I thought the cross-cutting between stories was disjointing due to the vastly different paces of each tale.  I noticed a few blatant blue screen shots.  Some of the dialogue seemed out of place, almost hokey.  And on top of all of that, the film suffered from being the middle one in a trilogy, a film that by definition did not contain a true start or finish.Having said all of that, I still choose it as my best film of 2002 for this reason.  After I saw 'Chicago,'  I sneaked across the theater hall to catch the last half hour of 'Two Towers' again.  Not even close.  I thoroughly enjoyed 'Chicago' (#2 or #3 of 2002), but 'Two Towers' was simply on another level.  It completely swept me away into Middle Earth as I relished the final battle for Helm's Deep.  Gandalf and company streaking down the hill into the enemy was one of the best movie moments of the year.  The emotion seemed quite real, and even the slight melodrama didn't bother me at all.
Other highlights...the opening sequence of Gandalf and the Balrog was excellent, yanking the audience back into the story as though they never left.  All the battle scenes were not only epic, but cohesive.  Some directors just don't seem to know how to put a fluid and continuous battle together (see 'Gladiator').  But these (Helm's Deep primarily) were fantastic, ranking among the best ever on film.Bottom line: The best movies pull you into their world, make you feel their emotions, and relate to their characters.  'Two Towers' did all that and more, which is quite remarkable given the adventurous and fantastical nature of the film.",10,0,0,11 March 2003
The Incredibles," Yawn. Pixar does it again.
","As you probably know, 'The Incredibles' is the latest effort from Pixar, the animation company that produced a few movies you might have heard of ('Toy Story', 'Finding Nemo', etc.). Not a bad track record, and one that The Incredibles does nothing to damage. The plot itself doesn't contain anything extraordinarily unique, but it does combine familiar elements in a singular way. Take one part superhero movie, add in typical familial issues, shrink it to the level of 'Spy Kids', animate, and you have The Incredibles. For this family with various super powers, the problems arise when they are forced to abandon their alter-egos for a normal life. Their difficulties adjusting to suburban life are juxtaposed with common family issues that are all humorously impacted by superhero problems. Despite the borrowed themes, the film still succeeds, due to the precise amount of seriousness written into the quality story and animation. Somewhat like the James Bond movies, 'The Incredibles' smartly doesn't take itself too seriously. Often accompanied by a score of also Bond-esque wailing horns, the tone of the film is serious enough to make the events matter, yet loose enough to inform the viewer that the creators understand the clichés that pop up throughout. You can envision the writers winking when the characters use the word 'monologing' to describe the speech a villain makes right before his imminent demise. In ways like this, the movie gently and self-referentially pokes fun without the not-as-kid-friendly acid tongue of Shrek 2. Unlike previous Pixar work, which dealt primarily, with worlds unseen (toys, bugs, monsters, fish), 'The Incredibles' is a human story. Superhumans, yes, but still humans. This creates a greater challenge, as making animals and toys sympathetic is significantly easier than doing the same with humans, who need to be more rounded. But the movie uses numerous pieces from recognized types to accelerate audience connection with minimal introduction, diving directly into plot advancement. Rather than lazily using those stock characters as a crutch, the movie deftly churns the known types into unique combinations. For example, everyone knows about the practically impervious superhero (Mr. Incredible), but he isn't very often a married father of three. Everyone knows about the shy teenage girl (Violet), but how often can that girl literally be invisible? This mixture of types forms the foundation of the movie's superb humor, which is largely based on the colliding worlds. I.E., what does a superhero do when an emergency arises while en route to an important event? Simple, he checks his watch, sees that he has time, and saves the day.Because of the familiarity of the plot and characters, this is an important feature, as the film could easily have lapsed into superfluous clichés. Some will undoubtedly cite this triteness as a slight against 'The Incredibles', but I would compare it to 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', in that both movies simultaneously pay homage and parody the genres they reference, while still providing an expressly entertaining two hours. As expected, the animation is once again stellar, not in an ultra-realistic way, but in the fully three-dimensional manner that Pixar has established. The character design is what stands out though. Since the story is set in a comic book world, the characters are all exaggerated in one way or another. Dash, a fourth-grader, is excessively short; his sister Violet is supremely slender; Mr. Incredible has a massive torso, etc. These physical features serve as personality traits of their own, and further acquaint the audience with the fictional cast. The rest of the world is similarly semi-real, which effectively matches the semi-real nature of the story and characters and completes the look for which Pixar is known. Again the voice talent excels without distracting. Too often ('Shark Tale'), animated movies try to make the vocal actors the stars in lieu of highlighting a quality story. By generally eschewing A-list names for less famous but equally talented actors like Craig T. Nelson (Coach) and Holly Hunter (Thirteen) whose voices ring a bell but don't stand out, 'The Incredibles' presents the animated equivalent of an ensemble cast. Even Samuel L. Jackson, whose voice is probably the most recognizable, doesn't draw undue attention. This is the first Pixar film rated PG, and the rating is fully justified, due to plenty of action, explosions, and even a touch or two of innuendo (although it will likely go unnoticed by young children). If 'The Incredibles' were live action instead of animation, a PG-13 would definitely have been the result. I wouldn't advise many against seeing it; just be forewarned that the movie is more mature than previous such films. The crises are a little more serious, the danger is more 'real,' the humor is edgier. Not better or worse, just different. Following in the metaphorical footsteps of Looney Tunes, 'The Incredibles' continues Pixar's tradition of animation excellence in entertaining both children and adults. While this film is a step in a more mature direction, it maintains the youthful exuberance and wry sense of humor that permeate all of Pixar's work. Bottom Line: One of the year's best. Call it a high 8 of 10, maybe a 9 as it grows on me.",9,1,2,11 November 2004
The Mist," Do you have any hope at all in humanity?
","I haven't read any of Stephen King's books or stories, but I have learned two things from his movies. He possesses phenomenal insight into the human mind, and he is a freak. 'The Mist' proves both points fully with a simple story: a mist engulfs a small New England town, and a few dozen of its denizens are isolated in a grocery store, forced to deal with enemies both outside and inside the store, both strange and familiar.The best and brilliant parts of 'The Mist' are the explorations into the psyche of the various trapped townsfolk. If someone's character is truly exposed when under pressure, then the extreme circumstances of this movie strip souls down to their essences, with frightening results. There are heroes and villains, leaders and followers, stalwarts and cowards. In previous uses of King's source material, writer/director Frank Darabont burrowed into the heart of hope in 'The Shawshank Redemption' and delved into faith and the supernatural with 'The Green Mile'. Both movies placed normal people into extreme circumstances, and did so exceptionally well. In that general thematic regard, Mist is similar to those two excellent films. More specifically though, it varies greatly, stressing the negative aspects of humanity rather than positive traits. Along the way, plenty of complex issues arise, and they are most frequently addressed with a rough, dull blade that gashes boldly through the moral fiber of civilization. The results are rarely pretty, but always compelling.Lest you think this is a philosophical art house movie, let it be known that as a horror flick, independent of any deeper meaning, 'Mist' consistently entertains, with a handful of superb knuckle-whitening scenes enhanced by an excellent cast. But a dark decision in the final act makes it impossible for even the most casual moviegoer to completely ignore the thick subtext of King and Darabont.What prevents 'The Mist' from being a great movie is the frayed nature of that subtext. While the story is rife with interesting points, the commentary fails to coagulate into a comprehensible bigger picture. In a sense though, the fractured themes better befit such a moody picture, one that strikes its audience at many levels, leaving the mind spinning in a mist of its own.Bottom Line: 7 of 10 for a movie far smarter and deeper than the glut of recent horror releases.",7,6,13,28 December 2007
I Am Legend," You are not alone.
","'I Am Legend' debuted with a monstrous $77 million weekend, but is an atypical Will Smith blockbuster, largely bereft of the slam-bang action and/or comedy common to his big movies like 'Men in Black' or 'Enemy of the State'.As learned from the tagline and excellent first trailer, the premise is simple: Smith is Dr. Robert Neville, the last man left in a desolate New York City, but he is not alone. Someone or something lingers, a mystery that drives the first hour, which is absolutely fantastic. With the exception of a few flashbacks that gradually answer the hows and whys generated by the plot progression, Smith interacts with no one except Sam, his loyal German Shepherd.In this regard, 'I Am Legend' is a cousin to the amazing 'Cast Away'. While their respective tones are drastically different, both are set on islands void of humanity. Instead of a volleyball, Smith anthropormorphizes a dog. Hanks wrestled with inner demons on his deserted island, Smith confronts outer demons of some sort. The difference in supplies is noteworthy, and the two main characters are driven by widely disparate motivations, but the isolated survival instinct is similar, and watching Smith stretch himself as an actor is extremely enjoyable. Smith's character still possesses elements of the cocky, wise-cracking nature that moviegoers know well, but with merely a glance or a twitch, his confident veneer often cracks to reveal the effects of his time spent alone. Seeing that uncharacteristic vulnerability is initially disorienting, because we're not used to seeing a hero crack like this, but the awkwardness soon yields to awe at the powerhouse solo performance.Aside from Smith's turn, the highlights of the movie are the breathtaking shots of a desolate New York City. We've seen the empty streets of a booming metropolis before, in movies like 'Vanilla Sky' and '28 Days Later', but this is different. Not only is everything deserted, but also overgrown and eroded by nature and time. The minimal music and slow-moving cameras allow for an eerie and appropriate quiet within the movie, creating a game of I Spy in which one's eyes dart about, searching for familiar landmarks like Jumbotrons or Broadway signs.The only downside to all this quality is that it doesn't last throughout the entire movie. Without giving too much away, I can say that following a key plot development, the third and final act transforms into a more familiar, action-type of movie, leading to a finale that satisfies, but doesn't quite match the preceding hour-plus. This dissonance is very reminiscent of 2004's 'Collateral', which similarly enthralled throughout before wimping out at the end, like a color scheme that matches at first glance but clashes upon closer inspection.If you know what you are in for, you will enjoy the movie more thoroughly. 'I Am Legend' is much more 'Cast Away' than 'Independence Day', more 'Signs' than 'Bad Boys'. In his best performance yet, Will Smith proves that he has the acting chops to match his pretty face and ripped physique, deepening his own cinematic legend as he frequently carries this movie to great heights.Bottom Line: Two-thirds of a great movie plus one-third of an average movie equals a good movie. 7 of 10.",7,0,1,28 December 2007
Hero," Super Hero.
","Every year as August winds down, ending with it the summer movie season, I get burned out on theatrical releases, having seen most all of the major summer flicks, as well as many independent films. Typically one release resurrects my cinematic spirit, and this year 'Hero' ('Ying xiong') filled the role. It is the latest martial arts film from China to invade American cineplexes. In many ways, it reminds of the last such successful film, 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,' except that 'Hero' has a plot. Just kidding...sort of. In actuality, the story is much more concise and straightforward than 'Crouching,' despite the non-linear method. In ancient China, the nameless...er...hero of the story, portrayed by the familiar Jet Li, arrives at the palace of the emperor. Having slain three of the emperor's enemies, Li, whose character is nameless, has come to claim his reward. As the two discuss how Nameless accomplished his deeds, we see (through extensive flashbacks) what did and didn't happen, and the truth is ultimately unearthed. Were the plot told in a linear manner, the story would not be especially noteworthy, but how the tale is told elevates the narrative. With truths being revealed in an unorthodox order, the audience is kept off-guard and pensive, trying to match wits with the two primary characters, who are each uniquely brilliant. Like most Chinese cinema, much about 'Hero' is drastically different from the majority American cinema. Most blatantly apparent is the vivid color scheme. Exploding off the screen, the variety of dominant colors throughout the flashbacks propels the film by generating a bold yet natural vivacity that leaves viewers eager to indulge in whatever beauty may occur next. The cinematography of some films ('Lord of the Rings') rightfully soars due in large part to the scenery. But 'Hero' excels using traditional photography in a non-traditional manner with a dramatically ebullient color palette that literally takes one's breath away at times. Despite the nearly peerless visual artistry, 'Hero' still presents an occasionally difficult viewing experience, one that does not necessarily detract but does sometimes distract. I say this fully aware that as I have been raised, for better and worse, on American cinema, and am thusly accustomed to such work. Chinese films are quite simply different, and these vagaries of pacing, shot length, etc., prevent full involvement for many American movie-goers. There isn't one feature of 'Hero' that causes this disconnect, as all aspects are well executed. The small cast, with Jet Li as the primary recognizable face, effectively exhibits the renowned passion of Chinese cinema. The editing is clean and efficient, maintaining a clear narrative when the story could easily have been convoluted. None of the parts produce the difference. It's more like watching a genre you've never seen before; you're simply not entirely sure how to react at times.Bottom Line: If you're a fan of Chinese martial arts films, then you may have already obtained a DVD of 'Hero,' since it was released in China two years ago. If not, or if you want a different cinematic experience, then go see 'Hero' to discover the upper tier of Chinese cinema. You won't regret it. A high 7 or low 8, out of 10.",7,2,3,1 November 2004
Shrek the Third," Where is Shrek?
","The first 'Shrek' came out of nowhere, an offbeat fractured fairy tale with a story suitable for kids and jokes aimed at adults. 'Shrek 2' contained more of the same, particularly the latter, with an emphasis on MORE. The story was cruder, with images and humor that I wouldn't want my kids to see, and overbearingly bloated with gags, as the writers stuffed aural and visual pop culture references in like Mark Mangino at a buffet. Watching the sequel felt like being bludgeoned with a comic hammer that screamed Look what we can do! That progression leads to 'Shrek the Third', batting second in the summer of the sequel, featuring an underwhelming trailer that threatened to continue the slide of the series.Not unexpectedly, this is the worst of the three, but the reasons for its limited appeal are surprising. The creators heeded the complaints about 'Shrek 2' containing too many pseudo-clever jokes, which is good. Specific allusions like 'Mission: Impossible' or 'Lord of the Rings' have been largely replaced by general parodies of events like high school life and Broadway musicals. This alteration in humor is welcome but too severe, stripping the franchise of its definitive irreverent nature, which is bad. 'Shrek 3' swings the comedy pendulum from the in-your-face extreme of the second past the moderation of the first to a unpleasantly safe converse. It frequently feels more like a less saccharine Disney movie than a Shrek movie, complete with a schmaltzy moral at the end.That's not to say that the movie isn't funny. The writing occasionally crackles; excellent comic timing is pervasive; and the sundry offbeat appearances of noteworthy characters like Captain Hook and Snow White are still entertaining. But on the whole everything feels restrained, like a kid who was reprimanded for doing something wrong and is now afraid to do much of anything. As much as I didn't like all of the prequels' base humor, this one needs more of it. The less flamboyant nature of the movie also diminishes its appeal to children, as does the metamorphosis of Shrek himself from rambunctious troublemaker to calmer father figure, a transformation that makes him more accessible to adults than kids.In the end, the movie ends up feeling much like the main character. Just as Shrek himself feels that the confinements of the crown prevent him from being himself, the movie feels muzzled, neutered by knee-jerk reactions to the second movie. It isn't gratingly bad, but neither is it actively good. 'Shrek the Third' (good title, by the way) merely idles its way through a rightfully short eighty-seven minutes.Bottom Line: Third verse, different from the first (and second). Not quite the same, and notably worse. 5 of 10.",5,1,2,3 July 2007
Moulin Rouge!," Unlike anything you've ever seen.
","The opening moments of this movie were a bit disorienting, as I was swept into a world and a film unlike any other I'd ever experienced.  But I kept in mind that Baz Luhrman simply doesn't make normal movies (See other work 'Strictly Ballroom' and 'Romeo & Juliet'), but rather audio-visual extravaganzas.  The music is what carries the film as the quirky pop adaptations, although odd at first, work very well and mesh seamlessly with the equally high-caliber original music.  In fact this is the rare film that, while nothing quite compares to a theatrical viewing, is as good on DVD.  I attribute this to the music.  Like listening to a favorite CD over and over, 'Moulin Rouge!' is an enjoyable two hours time and time again, and the music will stay with you for even longer.  But unlike many movie musicals, the music here advances the story along, rather than simply providing melodious entertainment.  It also enhances the story by displaying a greater depth of emotion than most mere words are capable of expressing.  As for the vocal qualities, I found it quite refreshing to listen to the actual singing voices of the cast.  Kidman, McGregor, and others supplied their own vocals, which was a fantastic change from the typical pre-packaged pop or opera sounds.  Tough movie to describe, but in a sentence, it's a flashy, fast-cutting, moving-camera, music-drenched portrayal of a love story set within a modern turn of last century nightclub.  Bottom Line:  Every year there are two or three movies that genuinely get me excited about what can be done with and through film.  'Moulin Rouge' was one of those in 2001.  Top Five of the year. 8.5/10",8,3,4,14 March 2003
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Why are you destroying our planet?
","Five movies into the summer of the sequel, the first release that is not a third installment is finally here. 'The Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer' is merely the second in a series, following 2005's original that introduced moviegoers to Mr. Fantastic (Ioan Gruffold), The Invisible Woman (Jessica Alba), her brother The Human Torch (Chris Evans), and The Thing (Michael Chiklis). (Audio review here.) The story in this follow-up is basic superhero stuff, picking up not too long after the last one ended. Mr. Fantastic is getting ready to wed The Invisible Woman, then bad things happen, and The Fantastic Four are called upon to remedy the problem, which involves the Silver Surfer destroying the planet and Dr. Von Doom doing whatever it is he does.From there the heroes do their hero thing, which is accompanied by just enough side story to form slightly rounded characters and plot. Like its predecessor and the comic books on which they both are based, 'Silver Surfer' is a different breed of superhero movie, one that varies in tone and content from recent renditions of more popular heroes like Batman, Superman, and Spider-man. With its multiple lead characters, 'Silver Surfer' occasionally reminds of the X-Men flicks, but does not match the gravity present in those movies or other recent hits featuring the aforementioned main characters. Those are serious, more intense movies that can create wonderful cinematic experiences that feel more 'real'. Not that any of these kinds of movies are truly real, but both of the Fantastic Four movies have a more cartoon-ish feel that distances them from reality.This is both a blessing and a curse. On the downside, 'Silver Surfer' does not have the emotional attachment that other superhero pictures have or at least desire, which limits the scope of the movie's power. A surprising side effect is the everyday levity that is provided. If you and your buddies had bizarre superpowers, wouldn't you frequently be making fun of each other's gifts and using your own for not entirely kosher reasons? Movies with solo protagonists are rarely able to capture such interactions, but with its tight-knit lead characters, Surfer can and does, with degrees of success that vary like most attempts at humor, from clever and hilarious to flat and unfunny. Nothing is brilliant or profound, everything just creates a casual surface relationship between movie and viewer.The minimal depth also allows for a streamlined hour and a half movie that has cursory side stories, unexplainable technology, and vague villainous motives, all of which is completely fine, if not preferable. Just as popcorn should not be loaded with substantive fruits and vegetables, popcorn movies like this one should not be loaded down with messages and complications that don't enhance the story.The shallow story and characters possessing only one or two dimensions means that the movie never has much chance of succeeding on multiple levels, so if you expect a serious action movie, you will be disappointed with 'Rise of Silver Surfer', as you likely were with the original. If you expect mindless superhero entertainment and a near carbon copy of the first installment, then you will leave the theater content with what you saw.Bottom Line: There is a place for movies like this: DVD rental. 5 of 10.",5,1,3,3 July 2007
Transformers," Less than meets the eye.
","I have low expectations for summer movies. I realize that they are often mindless entertainment with minimal plot and multiple explosions. That's fine. There is a place for such flicks, and I watch them without much hope of something grand. Remember that as I say this with no exaggeration: 'Transformers' is the worst summer blockbuster I have ever seen. Let me take you through the anatomy of this horrible movie.From the stiff opening voice-over that details the backstory, you sense trouble. Thirty minutes in, you're still waiting for the movie to gain traction, even though a big action sequence already happened. As the action wanes, the awkward dialogue blares through. You realize this isn't Shakespeare, but George Lucas could have improved this script. Simple words in the midst of action are one thing, but as the focus of several too-long scenes, the lame dialogue is painfully amplified. When you're not sure if the humans are delivering their lines better than the robots, that's a bad sign.But you know more transformers are coming, so you wiggle your feet impatiently while anxiously awaiting their arrival. Finally the rest of the good guys show up. 'Wow, those are sweet looking robots!' you think. You begin to settle in for a rip-roaring second half, until you realize there's not much else to them. It's like finally getting a date with that hot girl you've been crushing on, then realizing how unbelievably vapid she is before the main course is even served.By then of course you're stuck for the remainder of the evening. You deal with the ill-fated attempts at creating drama. Every ten minutes, you wonder what the heck is happening or question the movie's logic, which is awful even for the genre. You laugh several times, though the causes are largely unintentional. Is that John Tuturro wildly out of place? Does Tad Hamilton actually have a leadership position in the military? You hope desperately that the show might end with something redeeming like an epic battle. Here come all the bad guys (out of nowhere), this could be good...but no. The final clash is big and loud, but also confusing and by that juncture, pointless. Emotional attachment isn't necessary in a popcorn movie, but there needs to be at least a minute level of curiosity. You don't care if they kill the humans or kill the robots or kill all of them. Whatever.You sit through the credits, unsure of whether or not you want to be rewarded with a bonus scene. Yep, there's one. Yoikes, that was bad. At least it was short. Wait, there's one more, a final reminder of how miserably the movie failed, like the last rock that always crushed Wile E. Coyote.The worst part is that 'Transformers' has potential, as the trailer proves. Vehicles turn into giant robots! How is that not cool?!? But the flick scarcely if ever delivers on that promise. The visuals are representative of the whole movie. Well done, occasionally impressive, but too often fights or transformations are seen either from a distance too great or too close, depriving the audience of the true scope of the shot, and of any interest in the movie.Perhaps a knowledge of the source material, with which I am only passingly familiar, would make the movie more palatable, but I doubt it. Director Michael Bay, whose projects have steadily declined since 1996's The Rock, has reached a new low.Bottom Line: Please don't encourage a sequel by seeing this movie. 2 of 10.",2,38,81,3 July 2007
Million Dollar Baby," Oh Baby what a film!
","'Million Dollar Baby' is a film about fighting, both physical and otherwise, that traces the story of three diverse yet connected characters. Eastwood, who also directs, stars as Frankie, an aged boxing trainer and gym owner. Morgan Freeman, who narrates the film, plays his right hand man and friend, Scrap. And Hilary Swank joins in as Maggie, a young lady eager to learn the sport. Expectedly the story follows Maggie's boxing journey, and perhaps more importantly, Frankie's relationships with Scrap, Maggie, and an unseen daughter, as they each deal with the powerful themes of loyalty, forgiveness, and love.Watching 'Million Dollar Baby' is ridiculously enjoyable for a drama, the cinematic equivalent of cruising the spectacular Pacific Coast Highway with the wind whipping through your hair. The pace is steady and deliberate, like much of Eastwood's directorial work, but far from slow. And the scenery...oh, the scenery. Eastwood and Freeman, in roles similar to the screen image that each has cultivated over the years, are simply magnificent. How many actors can enrapture an audience with a discussion of socks? Or bleach? With their commanding presences, easy dialogue, and evident listening capacities, the pair presents a clinic in portraying old friends. Impressively, Swank fits right in with the two veterans. Sporting an impish smile and dogged determination, she expresses a proud humility that remains strong while reflecting her character's rough background. The ability to see great actors working brilliantly with great material is why many people go to the movies, and all three stars are worth the price of admission to observe, fully worthy of their Oscar nominations, as their interactions result in a picture that remains fully engaging without zooming from scene to scene.The beautiful simplicity of everything is captivating as well. Much like last year's 'Mystic River', Eastwood's ever steady hand guides the entire picture. The cinematography of Tom Stern ('River') is striking but not overwhelming, framing images perfectly and using slow movements to enhance the drama. His muted color scheme of blues, grays, and greens creates and matches the mood, and makes the occasional flashes of color all the more vibrant.Also like 'River', 'Baby' is accompanied by Eastwood's own simple yet elegant theme, on both classical guitar and piano, which accentuates the powerful emotion of the film. Baby lacks the palpable emotion of River, replacing it instead with drama that bubbles beneath the veneer of the boxing theme, and springs to life during the quiet in-between scenes that make the film great. On the sports movie spectrum, 'Baby' sits somewhere between the pure sporting nature of 'Rocky' and the sports-tinged drama of 'Raging Bull'. The boxing storyline is not unfamiliar, but the high technical value makes it seem fresh and original.Just when the course of the story seems apparent, in the final half hour the road of 'Baby' takes a dramatic hairpin turn, as the tone is drastically altered, nearly sending the audience into the ditch. The change throws the car out of alignment and disrupts the ride, but once things settle down, one can look back and see how brave a cinematic decision was made in choosing such a path. The end result is a a different course that culminates in a major moral dilemma, one that the film answers without preaching or diving into the issues of such a decision. In fact, 'Baby' doesn't even pretend to solve the problem, merely presenting the chosen option. Aside from that potential moral controversy, the only problem with the film is the precarious portrayal of the church, which is questionable at best and sacrilegious at worst, although the referenced flaws certainly do exist in the real world.Freeman's narration alone merits a recommendation for 'Million Dollar Baby'. But add the astonishing performances both in front of and behind the camera, and the aggregate is one of the best dramas in recent years, strong enough to present an extraneous story arc as touching instead of superfluous.Bottom Line: This is quite possibly the best film of 2004. 9 of 10.",9,4,7,2 February 2005
Garden State," Sometimes brilliant, but also flawed.
","**Minor Spoilers Ahead!!**As the latest indie film phenomenon, 'Garden State' echoes 'Good Will Hunting' in content and approach. Both are set in New England; both are about a young man finding himself while interacting with a girl. Both have moments of revealing truth that will strike a chord with most anyone. Not coincidentally, both are penned by young men as their first screenplays. Therefore unsurprisingly, 'Garden State' soars at times, but also stumbles at times, resulting in an uneven but ultimately worthwhile cinematic experience. The film is the brainchild of 29-year old writer/director/star Zach Braff (NBC's 'Scrubs'), and it follows in the footsteps of last year's 'Lost in Translation', gently telling a simple story of two people who find each other in a crazy world. Andrew (Braff), a L.A.-based actor, returns home to New Jersey (The Garden State...get it?) after a decade long absence. He reunites with his father and childhood buddies, and finds a new friend named Sam (Natalie Portman). As he explores those relationships and himself, he eventually discovers who he is and what he wants. In many ways, it's a typical coming-of-age story, but it often supersedes the genre. Set to a mellow Simon & Garfunkel (etc.) soundtrack, the film purports to be a comedy, and over the first half, does provide several humorous incidents. Not slapstick comedy, but rather a low-key observational humor described well in a paraphrase of Sam (Natalie Portman), 'If you can't find the humor in life, you won't enjoy it much.' While this is of course true, 'Garden State' tarries too long on Andrew's dissatisfaction with the people of his previous life. Some dysfunctional scenes are necessary to establish from whence Andrew came, but they overwhelm too much of the film. Credit Braff for firmly creating an unhappy world, but in a situation that is familiar to most viewers, such redundance soon becomes just that.The supersession occurs in the moments. Quiet moments. Intimate moments. Moments of frighteningly frank dialogue between two people. Moments that, more than anything else, reflect sheer honesty about issues that haunt twenty-somethings. Stripping oneself naked about themes like family, love, and future. These are the moments Braff dazzles wearing all three hats. Through his actions and direction he radiates the earnestness of the words he wrote, believing them as perhaps no one else could. These are also the moments that Portman earns her paycheck. A number of young stars could have played the off-the-wall portions, but most could not have sat down on a fireplace or staircase and assiduously asked questions. These moments are at the warm core of 'Garden State', even though many of them don't occur until the last thirty minutes. That part of the problem with the film. While providing a few amusing incidents in the first half, 'Garden State' meanders around for too long, heading loosely toward something, before finally veering onto the road and surging forward with purpose in the strong closing scenes. Of course, if the sometimes clumsy script had eliminated any number of gratuitous scenes, the running length would have been too short, but portions could have been added or extended as well. One sequence in particular seemed to be blatantly missing a few pieces. Andrew realizes something upon leaving a boat, but the events on board don't properly stimulate such a reaction. I understand what was supposed to happen, and since such an epiphany was inevitable in this sort of movie, I have little trouble accepting the change, but the impetus is lacking. Something had to have been clipped, axed, or otherwise altered, and that lack deprives the audience of another potentially brilliant moment, a pivotal one that could have highlighted the entire film.Being a twenty-something similarly searching for many of the same ideals as Andrew, I want to like this movie more; I want to rate it higher. But the flaws anchor down even a film with such remarkably resonant moments. In that way, 'Garden State' is like the life it reflects. There are painful moments, but there are also glorious moments that crescendo the film to phenomenal heights. Bottom Line: Call it 7 of 10, kicked up a notch for the younger crowd. This one will probably be higher than it should be on my year-end Top Ten list.",7,0,1,31 August 2004
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Good Luck to this movie at the Oscars.
","In the 1950s, CBS newscaster Edward R. Murrow did what virtually no one else dared. At the height of the Cold War, he objected to Senator Joseph McCarthy's raging campaign against Communism. That's about all many people (such as myself) know about the events, and this movie is here to fill in the holes. 'Good Night, and Good Luck' tells the true story of the Murrow-McCarthy confrontation, and the equally interesting behind-the-scenes dilemmas faced by Murrow and fellow news staff.The passing of time has dulled the accomplishments of Murrow, in large part due to the proliferation of news channels, investigative reporting, and rampant opinions. What Murrow did then could not happen in that way today. Therefore in order to craft a decent film, director George Clooney was faced with the essential task of re-creating the 1950s. In that regard, the film borders on flawless.With zero exterior shots, the clean black-and-white photography captures the claustrophobic mood of the era better than color pictures would have, similar to the 2000's Clooney-produced, made-for-television Fail Safe. Reactionary glances surrounded by ubiquitous swirling cigarette smoke establish a bygone mindset and time, when cramped newsrooms were the norm, and newscasters who challenged politicians were not. Through these tight quarters the camera chases the actors like their reporters chased stories, infusing energy into what could have easily been a static film.'Good Night, and Good Luck' won't floor you with its dramatic power, as something like 'Million Dollar Baby' did. To use a baseball analogy, this isn't the Mickey Mantle of films, leaving a wake of awe behind. This is the Paul Molitor of movies, always solid but rarely spectacular. When the credits roll, one looks back to realize how well done the previous ninety minutes were. There are simply very few missteps.Clooney also succeeds where 'Syriana' failed, in making an accessible social point that anybody can recognize. While telling its story, 'Good Night, and Good Luck' naturally points out how the media landscape has changed in half a century, making one at least reconsider the media's role in the politics of the government and life. Not a life-altering aim, but a practical one achieved nonetheless.Like its protagonist, firmly and sharply played in Oscar-worthy fashion by relative unknown David Strathairn, 'Good Night, and Good Luck' wastes little time or effort, succinctly making its point and quickly getting out. It will be somewhat under-appreciated (and likely won't challenge for the top Academy Awards) due to a lack of overwhelming personal themes and fully developed characters. But in dealing with decisions and consequences of truth, justice, and the American way (sorry), this film establishes a standard of how to effectively and gently make a point while telling an interesting story.Bottom Line: Short, sweet, and to the point. Well done. 8 of 10.",8,1,2,3 February 2006
Shrek 2," Not a kids movie.
","I don't care what anyone says, 'Shrek 2' is not a kids movie. Yes, of course it's targeted towards the single-digit age crowd, but while they will no doubt enjoy it, this sequel is a little bit cruder, packed with more humor, and features a more complex story without the heart of the original.The storyline of 'Shrek 2' is 'Meet the Parents' plus 'Beauty & the Beast' all blended together inside a Fractured Fairy Tale. Shrek and his bride Fiona venture Far Far Away (yes, that's the name of the country) to encounter her parents for the first time. Of course calamity ensues, involving Donkey, a far-from-normal Fairy Godmother, Prince Charming, and Puss-in-Boots, an assassin who is one of the most entertaining animated characters in recent memory. The misadventures compose the story, which won't be difficult to follow for anyone past puberty. Younger viewers may not fully understand the plot, but there is enough mustache-twirling to clarify who is doing what to whom. What kids won't get is the pervasive tongue-in-cheek humor. I could name off a dozen movies and television shows that 'Shrek 2' parodies, ranging from 'Spider-Man' to 'C.O.P.S.' Some of these spoofs (such as the latter) are hilarious; some are predictable yet enjoyable; and sometimes they come so fast and furious that it feels like a 'Scary Movie.' On top of this, there are the ubiquitous visual gags. Any sign, poster, or storefront you can find is probably a medieval-ized piece of modern pop culture. For example, if you look closely, you'll spy a poster for 'Lethal Arrow 4' hanging at a Tower of London Records.Nearly all of these in-jokes are humorous, but after a while, they wear on you, revealing what is missing from 'Shrek 2': the good-natured heart of the first one. In 'Shrek,' the edgy humor that saturates the sequel was present, but the generally good nature neutralized the sarcasm. Without that counterbalance, the unrelenting comedy eventually feels too smug. I see it as the other side of the Disney coin. For example, some criticized 'Monsters, Inc.' for being overly sweet and sentimental. While I fully understand those comments, you also know what you're in for when you watch an animated Disney film. Likewise with most of Dreamworks animation. Like it or not, the studio has established a precedent of edgy humor to which it adheres. I suppose I should have expected the overwhelming tongue-in-cheek nature, but for whatever reason I didn't, and that bothered me a little. But I still completely enjoyed the film. I'm the type who likes to watch what is going on in the background, and for people like me, 'Shrek 2' is a feast.The vocal work is again excellent. To complement the returning trio of Mike Myers (Shrek), Cameron Diaz (Fiona), and Eddie Murphy (Donkey), Dreamworks has added an all-star lineup that includes Julie Andrews (Queen ), John Cleese (King), Rupert Everett (Prince Charming), and Antonio Banderas, who steals the show as the swashbuckling accented feline. With such a talented cast working on good material, little is expected to go wrong, and little does from a vocal perspective. The animation is definitely a step up from the original. Although 'Shrek 2' isn't aiming for complete realism, the opening scene of a horse and rider looks amazingly good. The upgraded vivid colors continue throughout, and the character animators shine during a thunderstorm scene, as they properly portray effects of water. This isn't 'Final Fantasy' of course, but it does rank with the work of Pixar, the industry standard. When I say 'Shrek 2' isn't a kids movie, I don't mean that kids won't like it, but I do mean that kids won't fully appreciate it in the way that many adults will. Those adults will still need to bring the kids in them to the movie, and with that in tow, they will be in for a rollicking two hours.Bottom Line: Edgier than the original, but just as enjoyable, at least for adults.

World Trade Center," It's not United 93, but it's not bad.
","Movies about September 11th, 2001, are not easy to watch, nor are they easy to review. On a lesser scale, they are this generation's equivalent of Tom Brokaw's Greatest Generation watching World War II films. I remember my grandpa discussing 'Saving Private Ryan', and he was always hesitantly uncomfortable, acknowledging that it was a well done, but he didn't enjoy it much. In a like vein, the fact that its viewers lived through the described day both abets and ails 'World Trade Center', Oliver Stone's emotional story about two emergency workers trapped in the rubble of the twin towers.Speaking of 'Ryan', 'WTC' also faces the same quandary as 'A Thin Red Line', in that it follows a similarly themed movie that might be the year's best film, 'United 93'. Like 'Line', 'WTC' differs widely from its chronological predecessor even though the general subject material is the same. Though set at Guadalcanal, 'Line' wasn't really about war, while 'Ryan' was precisely about the horrors of war. 'United 93' told a story from a primarily objective standpoint, allowing the audience's own genuine emotions to affect their viewing experience. Differently, WTC is about specific experiences on 9/11, looking to share the feelings of a the trapped officers and their left-in-limbo families. Those people certainly have their moments of primal emotion that can only stem from situations of life and death. The most touching ones spring from the family members left on the outside, forced to wait and wonder. For whatever reason, imagining the loss or endangerment of loved ones is more potent than imagining one's own physical danger, and the portrayal of that blistering boredom cuts to the quick of anybody with a heart.As soul-wrenching as these events are, and despite the fact that they are true, they still feel like movie moments. Strong and good movie moments, yes, but even the best of those cannot match someone's personal feelings from that day, feelings created by actually being there. Make no mistake, the movie is very well made. Although Oliver Stone did direct it, none of his trademarks are present here. There is no kinetic editing ('JFK'); there are no flashy visuals ('Any Given Sunday'); there is no agenda of any kind ('Platoon'). Were his direction not so publicized, one would have no idea of his involvement. He wisely lets the story tell itself, using a straightforward story-telling method that gently weaves together the disparate experiences of the two men and their families.Perhaps I erred in seeing this on September 11th, after a day spent reliving my own emotions and those of actual people who were there on that day. 'World Trade Center' is a good movie that contains raw human emotion more powerful than most put on screen. But even that drama simply cannot match what we personally experienced when living through that day, regardless of the dire circumstances. That makes the movie less compelling than it should be.Bottom Line: Better drama than most, but missing an extra dose of passion to push it to the next level. 7 of 10.",7,1,3,9 December 2006
Black Hawk Down," Exhausting, but well worth it.
","**Warning! Mild Spoilers Ahead!**After watching this movie, I was mentally exhausted.  Take the ending battle of 'Saving Private Ryan' and stretch it to two hours, and that's the intensity of 'Black Hawk Down.'Following the introductory prelude, the ultra-realistic battle action was unrelenting.  Character development was not stressed (although all the acting was solid), but that wasn't necessary to the structure of the movie. Story was, and it was quite good.  I learned a lot about a battle about which I knew virtually nothing.  My favorite movie moment of 2001 occurs over halfway through, when American helicopters zoom across a battle zone with Gatling guns blazing, pinning down the opposition and freeing up U.S. troops.  Seeing and hearing that as an American soldier had to be one of the greatest feelings of all time.Bottom line:  I find it fascinating that a story can be so good w/o much character development, but in this case, it works very well.  The story basically tells itself, and Ridley Scott and company produced great war visuals.  One of the top five of 2001 and in the top tier of turn-of-the-century war movies.  8.5/10",8,0,0,13 March 2003
Big Fish," I'm hooked.
","**Warning! Mild Spoilers Ahead!**As one might expect from Tim Burton, 'Big Fish'is an unconventional story, but one that provides a refreshing alternative to the epics that currently populate a good portion of cinemas. Big Fish tells a father-son story. Set in past and present South, Ed and Will Bloom (Albert Finney and Billy Crudup), are somewhat estranged because Ed constantly speaks in grandiose tales, the veracity of which is highly dubious. Will has always been frustrated by the apparently duplicitous life of his father and had thus cut off communication with him. Toward the end of the father's life, the two reunite, and Ed's legends are examined from multiple perspectives. Most everything about this film was well done, and it all starts with director Tim Burton. While this is not his best film (I'd go with Batman), it is certainly his most human and personal. In an often tender tale, he continues his brilliantly imaginative work by crafting a fantastical world filled with such characters as witches, giants, and circuses (circi?) that is somehow still grounded in reality. But Burton eschews his usual dark style (Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow) in favor of a more gentle manner that still allows the technical aspects and actors to do the work. And a wise decision that is. The production design of Dennis Gassner (Road to Perdition) is exceptional, presenting a fanciful yet still reality-based look to match Burton's creativity. Musically, Danny Elfman once again collaborates with Burton on this film, mixing his typical quirky score with a handful of Southern-flavored classics like the Allman Brothers' 'Ramblin' Man' and Elvis' 'All Shook Up.' The many different tones of this film could easily have been sloppy or inconsistent, but the technical prowess effectively provides the film with a thorough cohesiveness. On the acting front, Albert Finney has been nominated for Golden Globe, and while he is quite good, I aver that Billy Crudup is at the heart of 'Big Fish.' Best known as a rock star in 'Almost Famous,' Crudup shines here as the son searching for truth. He brings a sincere earnestness to the role, with gestures and looks that embody the yearning for honesty for which everyone longs. Just the way his eyes bounce, always looking for truth, is enough to drive this story forward. Additionally, a cast of actors' actors that includes Ewan McGregor, Jessica Lange, Alison Lohman, and Helena Bonham Carter is of equally high quality, combining to form one of the best ensembles of the year. Most impressive is the continuity, both visual and otherwise, displayed between multiple actors playing the same character at different ages. Finney and McGregor as Ed Bloom, along with the always good Lange and Lohman as his wife Sandra, all match proper appearances and idiosyncrasies for some of most seamless age transitions I've seen in recent years. In most movies, you must suspend belief to buy the fact that one actor grew into another; but in 'Big Fish,' you will honestly think Burton discovered a time warp.
The downside to this film is the contrived feelings that are occasionally manifested by the efforts to make the fish analogies work. Everything, including the title of course, comes back to fish. Whether it be the father's favorite story or the odd physical transformations that are woven into the narrative fabric, these metaphors are just a little too cute, detracting a tad from the human heart of the movie. But that heart is remarkable, revolving around powerful human themes of love and family, and the communication within those bonds. Will desperately wants to truly know his father, and in that process learns a good deal about himself. That's what life is all about, and that's what 'Big Fish' expresses so very well. Bottom Line: Every year there are just two or three films that get me excited about what can be done with the medium. With its unique story and highly imaginative design, Big Fish achieves that distinction.  It's a treat of a film for movie lovers.  A high 8/10.",8,0,0,11 January 2004
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," The second-best movie in the series.
","After a summer of movies filled with second, third, and fourth sequels, the most anticipated follow-up is finally here, and it is a fifth installment. 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix' is the story of Year Five at Hogwarts for lead characters Harry, Hermione, and Ron, although a large portion of the movie occurs outside the grounds of the teens' school. More than a children's book, this episode builds upon strong themes of fear and friendship to create a solid piece of cinema.(Note: I have read only the first five books.) 'Order of the Phoenix' ('OOTP') tracks the ongoing saga of the interactions between the dark Lord Voldemort and Harry Potter, who is aided by the titular order, a sort of wizard Joint Chiefs of Staff. Many in the wizarding community doubt Harry's story that Voldemort has returned, and the Ministry of Magic has it in for Dumbledore, all of which means that Harry feels more alone than ever, despite the presence of people and places he loves. As always with a movie adapted from popular literature, two questions must be answered. 1) Was it a good movie, and 2) Was it a good adaptation of the book? Pleasantly, the response to both questions is yes, though each affirmative requires unique qualification.Having read the book, judging the movie strictly on its own merits is very difficult, because gaps on screen are filled in subconsciously by knowledge of the book. But this movie seems to succeed apart from those pages. Relatively unknown director David Yates keeps the story Harry-centric, giving it a brisk pace and making the main arc easy to follow, although a few other truncated story lines and characters will be enjoyed more by those who know them fully. Expanded motifs of Harry's anger and loneliness are expressed clearly but not heavy-handedly, through both pictures and the words of multiple characters. As was the case with the previous two installments, viewing this movie without first reading the book may result in confusion or at least a lesser understanding of everything, but having seen the first four movies will be plenty to let one comprehend this episode to an enjoyable extent.The latter question is more complicated. Many people will complain about plot elements that vary from the book. Those objections are true but invalid. Maybe a beloved character was axed, tweaked, or minimized. Perhaps a treasured moment was omitted or included in a disappointingly disparate manner. Make no mistake about it; many things were altered. But when an 870-page tome is being condensed into a two hour and eighteen minute movie, cuts must be made. Much like time constraints demanded that 'The Lord of the Rings' focus largely on Frodo at the expense of favorites like Tom Bombadil, this story must focus on Harry Potter. There are reasons that he is the title character. So no one gets to see Firenze teach or Ron and Hermione fight or anything about Quidditch or prefects. Looking objectively at the modifications though, the primary story arc does advance satisfactorily without those missing parts. Perhaps the galloping pace could have slowed to a canter, as the movie was indeed a rarity that could easily have been twenty minutes longer. But the purpose should then have been to expand upon the elements already in place rather than to add missing ones.The more important goal is that the movie be faithful to the spirit of the book, and on that level, 'OOTP' hits its mark. 'Prisoner of Azkaban' displayed the world of wizards better than any other Potter movie because of two key inclusions: the little ways magic was used in the background and the fantastic scene-setting shots. Yates nearly recaptures Alfonso Cuaron's brilliance, approaching it with elements like kittens wandering around in pictures and spectacular zooms over Hogwarts. Of equal importance, he also executes small moments even better than the source material, wonderfully depicting simple enjoyments like laughter and friendship are a stark contrast to the lurking complex evil of You Know Who. These small interactions imbue the movie with a soul that adds substance and humanity to an adventurous and magical universe.'OOTP' suffers slightly from middle-film-in-a-series syndrome, but in a good way. Much like 'The Two Towers' or 'The Matrix Reloaded', one gets the feeling that it picks up and ends mid-story, with only a necessary modicum of resolution, as though setting the stage for something grand. That promise of something huge just ahead actually enhances the power of the movie. It leaves one desperately awaiting the next chapter more so than any other Potter movie. 'Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince', the next in the series, screams to be (re-)read before the seventh and final book is released next Saturday.Ultimately, viewers who have not read the book should be able to follow along easily, and the movie should quench the appetites of fans with reasonable expectations. The gist of the book is explored in numerous ways, resulting in an experience that will leave one with a few thrills and chills, and a smile on one's face.Bottom Line: A concise return to the spirit of the book, capturing the world with a proper dose of cinematic license. 7 of 10 for the second best movie in the series.",7,0,1,14 July 2007
The Graduate," Decent but dated.
","**Warning! Spoilers Ahead!**Some films age well, as their themes and styles resonate through different eras and lifestyles. 'The Graduate' is not one of those films. All of the values of this movie scream 1960s, and as a member of a generation defined by motivation and ambition, I find the pictured values of confused sexual rebellion and pronounced indifference difficult to understand. At its core, this movie is simply a twisted romantic comedy. The twisted part arrives when Benjamin (Dustin Hoffman) decides to pursue Elaine Robinson basically out of spite. I suppose this fit in with the '**** You' attitude of that flower child generation, but now it just seems inane. Speaking of inane, Benjamin's theft of Elaine at the end of the movie is plain silly. Initially it's a cute and spontaneous moment. But upon any reflection, Elaine has zero reason to abscond with him, yet joyfully flees the scene as though Benjamin were a white knight. Again, maybe in 1967 his character was Galahad personified, but that shining armor has rusted greatly since then. I can appreciate the style of the film. From the opening scene in the airport to the vivid yet reserved colors throughout the film, the look of 'The Graduate' endures not necessarily as ground-breaking, but as a '60s time capsule. Bottom Line: While this film was evidently a grand statement at the time, its message and appeal have faded greatly in the 35 years since then.

The Last Samurai," The Last Caucasian.
","In my high school writing class, I was told that when writing a paper I should do tell the reader what I was going to say, say it, and then explain what I said. While that is an excellent primer for the written word, the method doesn't translate as well to the big screen, as effectively illustrated in this film of great themes, which is slightly marred by heavy-handed redundancy. **Warning! Mild Spoilers Ahead!**'The Last Samurai' tells the story of Nathan Algren, played by Tom Cruise, a unhappy and drunk Army captain who is recruited by the Emperor of Japan to train the incompetent Japanese troops in the ways of modern weaponry. The purpose is to combat the (ahem) last samurai, led by the fearsome Katsumoto. Before long, Algren falls into enemy hands, and the bulk of the film follows his experience as the prisoner of the samurai, who indoctrinate him into their culture. As the main character, Cruise plays a part akin to every other role he's had, a cocky yet talented guy who learns his lesson over the course of the film. But he once again nails the part, this time with more human emotion than normal. In a role that could have easily been done in an over-the-top manner, Cruise chose not to do so and proved very effective. I don't think it's an Oscar-caliber performance, but it does rank among his best work. I do think that Ken Watanbe as Katsumoto is worthy of an Academy Award nomination. A new face to American cinema, his pathos-packed performance is the soul of this film, a physically imposing presence who fills the screen literally and figuratively. A la Chow Yun-Fat, he appears primed to make the Pacific leap to stardom in the United States. As is apparent from the advertising, this is intentionally a film of epic scope, and that theme enjoyably oozes through the technical aspects of the movie thanks to an experienced top-notch crew. Director Edward Zwick ('Glory,' 'Courage Under Fire') again provides a sure and steady hand in getting what he wants and needs out of all participants. In a musical style reminiscent of his 'Black Hawk Down' work, Hans Zimmer presents his usual excellent orchestral accompaniment with clear and ear-pleasing tinges of Eastern music. Editors Victor Du Bois and Steven Rosenblum, who both worked on 'Braveheart,' accomplish the underrated achievement of comprehensibly piecing together chaotic battle scenes. And speaking of that film, Cinematographer John Toll also shot 'Braveheart' and 'The Thin Red Line,' and one can see visual similarities between the films. Toll provides the mandatory sweeping battlefield shots, along with numerous slow pans that allow time for the passion of the Japanese culture to bleed through the screen. While some movies thrive with the help of or in spite of their behind-the-scenes aspects, Last Samurai excels because of the firm technical foundation. The main annoyance I have with 'Last Samurai' is its single-minded intent to hammer the virtue of Japanese culture into the thick American skulls. Within the first half hour, the theme is made evident, but that does not prevent the filmmakers from iterating and reiterating it to the very end of the film. Before long, this wears on the audience, leaving them a bit antsy over the last half hour, which would have been better off shortened or altered, instead dragging down the film in the final act. I don't say this to minimize the importance of culture in this film. In fact, I think it was portrayed very well, but even something done well becomes bothersome when repeated too many times. Bottom Line: This film still attains near-greatness. In a lackluster cinematic year, it will assuredly be on my top ten list, entrenched a cut below the top tier as a film that is better than most and will deservedly earn a handful of nods come January.  8 of 10.",8,0,1,19 December 2003
Invincible," A decent sports movie.
","If you've seen the trailer for 'Invincible', then you know the story of Vince Papale, a Philadelphia everyman who earned a spot on his beloved Eagles through an open tryout in 1976. The fact that most of the plot is known is a negative in the sense that it robs the movie of most drama, but doesn't affect enjoyment much, because most sports flicks are straightforward anyway. Instead, the common underdog-turned-hero plot, along with strong lead performances from Mark Wahlberg and Greg Kinnear (as Coach Dick Vermeil) makes for an easy viewing experience.While Wahlberg is the headliner, Kinnear performs equally well in a parallel role, as Vermeil makes the jump from college football to the pros. He wisely chooses not to do a complete impersonation of Coach Vermeil, but does relate Vermeil's easy-going aura. If you have watched much of Vermeil in the last few years, then you will certainly find a few moments in the movie that make you chuckle and nod, thinking Vermeil would have said or done exactly that. As for Wahlberg, not many Hollywood stars would be believable as football players. Can you really see someone like Tom Cruise 0r Adam Sandler (ok, bad example) playing in the NFL? Didn't think so. But Wahlberg is an exception. He has the physique and attitude of an elite athlete (see: Calvin Klein ads), and in part because of his street background, he has the tough guy image down (see: 'Four Brothers'). But despite his evident charisma, he doesn't rise above his fellow cast members like Cruise sometimes does. Instead he represents the working man quite well and seems just like one of the boys from South Philly.The energy of those everyday Joes is the gas that drives the movie's engine. Through Papale's circle of friends and family, 'Invincible' captures two types of football passion wonderfully. Papale's bar pals exhibit the hardcore fanaticism that power any team's fanbase, and the generational enthusiasm that is passed down from father to son is also portrayed expertly via Papale and his dad. Both symbolize an ardor that transcends team loyalties, allowing fans of any team (except maybe the Giants) to share in the story. As everyone who has lived through 9/11 knows, sports can provide joyous moments, even in difficult times, and the movie effectively displays football as such an outlet without resorting to melodrama (ahem...'Rudy').In addition to these positive aspects, 'Invincible' has many of the characteristics mandatory in sports movies. There's a wet blanket female, adversity to overcome, and a handful of scenes that induce chills. The crunching football scenes are good too, although most of the action takes place either in practice or isolation shots involving Papale. The quality of football ought to be high though, since this is the first movie since 'Jerry Maguire' that was officially approved by the National Football League. The NFL's okay was vital in lending authenticity to the movie, as the real logos, name, and places create a fun game of who-was-that during the flick. Anyone who watched football in the 1970s will enjoy picking familiar names off jerseys, and recognizing names and venues as they are mentioned and shown.Sports movies are men's equivalent to chick flicks, pointing out a difference between the sexes. Women want to fall in love; men want to be sports heroes. So even though the plot is fairly routine, 'Invincible' provides solid sports entertainment, particularly in the current build-up to football season, during which Disney was smart to release the film. It surpassed my mediocre expectations, and that's good enough for a recommendation from me.Bottom Line: As 'Rocky' in cleats, it satisfies a fix, and does so in surprisingly efficient fashion. 6 of 10.",6,0,0,9 December 2006
The Great Raid," The worst war movie in recent memory.
","I love war movies and usually keep tabs on the upcoming films in the genre. Therefore I was shocked last week when I saw a television commercial for 'The Great Raid', a movie I had heard nothing about. Now I know why.Inspired by actual events, 'The Great Raid' relates a relatively obscure World War II story in which the 6th Ranger Battalion must rescue 500 American prisoners-of-war from Cabanatuan, a Japanese POW camp in the Philippines. The film traces three converging stories about the POWs, the men sent to liberate them, and the civilian resistance front aiding the process, one member of which is romantically linked to one of the prisoners.While this plot sounds like an excellent foundation, the script and its interpretation prove to be the movie's complete undoing. War films do not require a full portrayal of everything related to the point of emphasis. Other aspects can be incorporated (as in 'Saving Private Ryan') through brief asides or short encounters with incidental characters. These cinematic conveniences are conspicuous here in their absence, as director John Dahl ('Rounders') and company ambitiously attempt to simultaneously tell all three sides of the story, and succeed in fully telling none of them. Had the movie focused on the rescue, it could have been decent. Instead trite and shrug-inducing story lines haphazardly slow everything down, pushing the decent battle scenes to the final act, by which point they are as inevitable and anticlimactic as possible. It is like stuffing an appropriately long one-hour episode of 'Band of Brothers' with far too much filler that overwhelms the actual point of the story.Due to this lack of action, numerous head-scratching military activities, and a weak romantic story arc, 'The Great Raid' never feels like any kind of war film, let alone a good one. Soldiers spy on passing enemies from visible locations a few feet away; in a scene that nearly parodies itself, a captain hastily scrawls important battle plans in the dirt; characters' motives are rarely explained. Considering how much time is spent attempting to rachet up the drama, the audience is told as little as possible about all of the involved parties. A good amount of that time is spent relating a semi-love story that suffers from 'Cold Mountain' syndrome. The love interests are never given even cursory screen time together, and with the relationship sketchy anyway, the lack of any established connection causes that half of the movie to flounder as well.High technical achievement could possibly have salvaged 'The Great Raid', but the special effects, like the nondescript acting, are nothing more than average. The music of Trevor Rabin ('Armageddon') ranges from cartoon-like to a melodrama beyond anything John Williams has ever written. (Not to mention the shameless ripoff of Mozart's aria from 'The Shawshank Redemption') The sole redeeming factor of the entire movie is the color palette, which is largely backlit. The look does not possess the grit of 'Saving Private Ryan' nor the vibrancy of 'The Thin Red Line', but lies somewhere in between. A slightly washed-out scheme emphasizes the natural greens and browns of the surroundings while still permitting the occasional bright hues to shine, literally and figuratively. But not even that and the blatant flag-waving bookends are nearly enough to earn the movie a recommendation.'The Great Raid' sat in the Miramax vaults for over a year, until the Weinsteins dumped it into theaters before their upcoming split with Disney. With two-thirds of the story wholly unnecessary and the rest filled with stock characters and situations, there is little wonder it might never have been released otherwise. This is one of the worst war movies I've ever seen, and that statement is coming from a guy who likes most any such film.Bottom Line: I don't even recommend this for fans of the genre.

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," This Cup runneth under.
","Note: I have read only the first four Harry Potter books. Take that as you will.Isn't this inevitable in any cinematic series? Maybe even more so given all of the behind-the-scenes changes between the Harry Potter films? Isn't one of the movies eventually doomed to fall short of its predecessor? Perhaps. Perhaps not. But 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire' did.The story of 'Goblet' takes a different turn, as the once-in-a-generation Tri-Wizard Tournament comes to Hogwarts, whose top students are joined by comrades from two other schools of magic in battling each other and colossal obstacles for the top prize. As the tournament progresses, Harry Potter endures issues with relationships and a mysterious pain emanating from the famous lightning bolt on his forehead. A very promising premise that ultimately shortarms its potential.The roots of 'Goblet''s shortcomings lie in its predecessor, Alfonso Cuaron's 'Harry Potter & the Prisoner of Azkaban'. Had 'Goblet' been released after Chris Columbus's two faithful but uninspired renditions, this movie would have been better. But Cuaron raised the bar for the screen translations with his breath-taking scene-setting and finely crafted shots. He infused the series with life by adding a dose of reality to Columbus's magical world. Newell wisely maintained the grounded portion of Cuaron's tone, but inexplicably drained it of Columbus's child-like wonder, while fading into typical technical film-making, feats that constantly leave the audience wanting more of everything.'Goblet' is an epic book, a linchpin as the middle tome of seven. After You-Know-Who was absent in Azkaban, his presence returns here, turning the series in an entirely different direction. But despite the enormous themes of life, death, courage, and danger; despite the fact that Goblet contains more action than 'Azkaban'; despite scenes with Quidditch, dragons, and mermaids, nothing in the movie gets the blood pumping. Even a massive confrontation in the final act leaves one feeling short-shrifted, emotionally for those who know the story and informationally for those who have not. The same material produced a pulsing thread of underlying tension throughout the book, and the absence of that drama points to the way the movie was made. While Cuaron adroitly fashioned a soul for his movie and built everything around that hub, Newell and cinematographer Roger Pratt ('Chamber of Secrets'), who semi-successfully warms up the screen by emphasizing oranges and greens, seem to have ploddingly shot the movie on cruise control. By utilizing far too many close-ups and intercutting tight shots, and eliminating much of the enchanting background, the scope of the movie leans toward claustrophobic rather than expansive.The music doesn't help either. The fitful work of Patrick Doyle leaves one longing for the occasionally melodramatic John Williams, whose lingering themes are the only memorable part of the orchestrations. The veteran Doyle, who has a few quality scores to his credit (Henry V, Hamlet), seems determined to tell the viewer what to think and how to feel, as though composing from a How-to-write-a-movie-score book. The music intrudes at some key times, then suddenly vanishes at others, screaming PAY ATTENTION THIS IS IMPORTANT in its absence. Like the movie, Doyle's compositions never find a rhythm with the story.The pacing of that story doesn't aid the rhythm. Even though Goblet as a whole moves quickly, small portions less integral to the core story periodically stagnate the movie. Numerous new supporting characters require valuable time to be introduced; several decent but truncated scenes and characters (Quidditch World Cup, Rita Skeeter, etc.) should have been omitted altogether but were probably crammed in to appease fans; and the broad humor seems forced and out of place. The end result is an choppy episodic olio that deprives the movie of any rapid undertow that might whisk an eager audience into the story.All of these issues prove that a Harry Potter director should not be merely a guiding hand, but a creative force as well. Fortunately for Newell the source material for 'Goblet', as in his Donnie Brasco, is so potent that even his workman-like turn doesn't cripple Rowling's towering tale. But his restraining hand lowers the level of exhilaration, the difference between admiring the Grand Canyon from on high and hang-gliding directly between its prodigious walls.Having said all of that, 'Goblet' is not terrible, and the massive amount of genuine effort is apparent. The majority of credit for the movie's success though stems from the original story, which weaves classic motifs into a richly textured saga. To transform the book into a bad movie would be a truly stunning feat, one not accomplished here. Many of the effects-laden magical scenes are a treat despite being underdone, and familiar characters in new situations are rarely dull. Most of the adult actors are virtually reduced to cameos; but they perform admirably, except Michael Gambon, who is misrepresenting Dumbledore by stressing anger over wisdom. Separating the kids from their roles is difficult, and perhaps actors with more training could more effectively display a range of emotions, but even that is difficult to say, because these actors are their characters. Replacing these cinematic friends at this point would be utterly ludicrous.Overall, 'Goblet' isn't bad, but neither is it actively good or absorbing. Very little wows or stokes emotional fires, a fact exacerbated by Azkaban's pronounced excellence in such situations. If the first and second movies were simple melodies, and the third blossomed into classic four-part harmony, then 'Goblet' is a barbershop quartet in which at least one part struggles throughout, missing notes and creating a movie that never enraptures as it could, leaving the uninformed viewer partially in the dark, and the informed viewer underwhelmed, longing for a film that fully addresses all the fantastic elements that comprise 'Harry Potter & the Goblet of Fire'.Bottom Line: 'Goblet' tries to soar to great heights, but finds itself chained down by its own shortcomings. 6 of 10.",6,2,3,21 November 2005
Mystic River," The best pure drama in some time.
","**Warning! Mild Spoilers Ahead!**In 'Mystic River,' director Clint Eastwood tells a complex story of three young boys whose lives are defined by a traumatic childhood event. Now in their thirties, the men's lives are again deeply intertwined by another traumatic and violent event, the mysterious physical, emotional, and psychological consequences of which are dramatically explored in this film.
But the mystery, although strong and completely enjoyable isn't the point as much as words and characters are. In contrast to many modern melodramas, the human drama here is formed using those words and characters, rather than music, editing, and cliche forlorn looks. And drama is the prime word to describe 'Mystic River,' the best film of its kind since 2000's 'Traffic.' Action and romance are side stories here, used as devices to drive the plot forward as it focuses on the characters and their words.
Those Oscar-worthy words and characters spring from the taut script of Brian Helgeland ('L.A. Confidential'), who has brilliantly adapted Dennis Lehane's novel. The script never lapses into triteness, and the characters rarely say anything that seems out of place. This dialogue forms the foundation for a rock-solid movie that will not lose its greatness as time passes.
The actors build upon that foundation with a slew of terrific performances. The cast have received numerous accolades already, and I throw my hat onto the awards bandwagon as well. Sean Penn is being singled out for his excellent centerpiece work as the complicated Jimmy Markham, but the rest of the superb cast holds up against him with ease. Their professionalism and experience oozes through every scene of the film. Little things make the difference, like Marcia Gay Harden absent-mindedly closing an open cabinet on her way out of a room. Or Penn nearly pouring himself one last drink, then changing his mind. Or the subtle ways that Tim Robbins alters his character over the course of the film. All of these nuanced performances add up to the best dramatic ensemble in years, and I haven't even mentioned the underrated Kevin Bacon or the ever reliable Laurence Fishburne.
In his best directorial effort that I have seen (although I unfortunately haven't viewed 'Unforgiven'), Clint Eastwood is remarkably efficient in delivering a classic drama in the vein of, dare I say, 'The Godfather.' Like Coppola's masterpiece, 'Mystic River' contains many of the great themes, such as family, vengance, and justice. These motifs carry the film, allowing audience connection in a world that is foreign to most viewers. It also presents a combination of moral questions and answers that only the best dramas have. These issues are what Eastwood uses to push his film to that next level of greatness. Technically speaking, the film is clean and simple, staying out of the way of itself and allowing the story to speak uninhibited. Editor Joel Cox (most of Eastwood's recent work) and cinematographer Tom Stern ('Blood Work') don't do anything fancy; no wild fades, zooms, or intricate editing techniques. In fact, the two are scarcely noticeable except for the commendable replication and placement of a couple key shots. Stern's background as a lighting technician is evident though, as he uses light and shadow wonderfully as he paints with a largely black and white palette. The music, largely composed by Eastwood himself (!), is also basic yet effective, providing primarily dramatic undertones, much like television's stellar 'Law & Order.' In fact, with its direct pacing and progressive mystery, the entire film could be described as a 2+ hour version of 'Law & Order,' done at a higher production level and featuring greater psychological and emotional depth. The only problems I see in this film are characters that are difficult to relate with and one story arc that seems truncated. As I mentioned, the characters involved are so flawed and different from many movie-goers that I can see some people having a difficult time relating. However, I personally can not relate to the story, yet was still captivated, which speaks to the true power of this film. And one story arc involving Bacon's character is not fully fleshed out; although this doesn't detract, it also does not involve at the same level. Bottom Line: This is a finely crafted film put together by a sublime mixture of technicians and actors.  Topped only by 'Return of the King' in 2003, Mystic River has set a dramatic standard that will be used for years to come.  9/10.",9,0,0,18 January 2004
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Mindless entertainment packed with It.
","Sometimes you're just in the mood for an escapist movie. Nothing too intelligent; nothing too twisting or unpredictable; just good-looking people living their ridiculously interesting lives. For women, this form of entertainment usually comes in the form of anything starring Julia Roberts or Hilary Duff, for the younger crowd. Guys usually go for almost anything featuring Tom Cruise. Although those names are absent, 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith' combines a bit of both types, fitting the mindless entertainment mold perfectly.If you saw a trailer for 'Smith', then you know the gist of the picture. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are married. But the implausibilities don't stop there. Unbeknownst to each other, both are guns-for-hire who assassinate VIPs for unseen higher powers. Eventually of course, the cover-ups must stop, and that's what the movie is about. A simple enough premise that follows a simple enough path, which is fine, because watching Smith is like attending a Kansas City Royals baseball game. You know what you're getting when you buy the ticket. You know you'll have a good time at the game, and you won't be shocked if the product is mediocre to bad, which is precisely where this film ends up.Even though, or perhaps because the entire story is inevitable, the plot still dragged at times, simply taking too long to set the scenes and then deliver the promised goods of shootouts, both martial and marital. Once there, the action scenes are good not great, and the miscommunicative banter between Pitt and Jolie as they rediscover each other provides the funny moments, which are the highlight of the film. Married or not, anyone can relate to their problems, which are magnified by the absurdity of their situation. Quality relational humor is as funny as anything, and there are some good jabs sprinkled throughout this movie, although still nothing particularly memorable.Also forgettable is the entire cast outside of Pitt and Jolie. The villains are scarcely given a face; Vince Vaughn is occasionally amusing in an over-the-top way; Adam Brody ('The O.C.') is pointless; and frankly no one else matters. Seriously, if all faces except the leads had been no names or even blurred out, the movie would not have suffered, because good versus evil is hardly the point of the flick. The point is see beautiful people fight with words and guns.Therefore the onus of the movie falls on the magnetism of Pitt and Jolie, which is fortunately palpable. Both are clearly sexy, beautiful people, and their chemistry is undeniable. The sensuality erupts off the screen more than even the explosions because they both possess It, that mysteriously inexplicable combination of looks, swagger, demeanor, sexuality, and accessibility. Whatever It is, they both own It, and thus glue eyes to the screen regardless of what they're doing, whether it be carrying a bazooka or a fork. Doesn't matter. You want to watch. From beginning to end, their allure and physical presences carry the movie. Without it, the product is something like 'Ballistic: Ecks versus Sever', which had more to work with, but whose leads (Banderas and Liu) lacked the charisma of Pitt and Jolie, resulting in a more interesting story that was less watchable.Looking for something profound in this movie is like hoping Britney Spears brings down the house with a Verdi aria. It's just not going to happen. If you anticipate such, then you deserve to be disappointed. But like '2 Fast 2 Furious', 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith' can fill two hours with mild entertainment if you have reasonable expectations.Bottom Line: A decent popcorn movie. Nothing more. 5 of 10.",5,2,4,1 November 2005
The Departed," If only it had finished well...
","On the heels of the annual fall movie lull comes the beginning of Oscar season. And you know what that means: lots of pretentious films that aren't very good! Yay! First in line, from Martin Scorsese, the man who brought us the overrated borefest that is 'The Aviator', is 'The Departed'...or is it? Plow on, fair reader...Generally speaking, Martin Scorsese's films all have a similar theme: exploring the complex lives of unlikeable people. His latest is The Departed, which follows two Boston police academy graduates who take drastically disparate paths. The movie is tortuous in every sense of the word. Plot twists are prevalent; people are not always who they seem; and deceit is the rule rather than the exception. Therefore Scorsese is the perfect director for this film, which can be neatly compared to a good piece of rope. (Go with me on this one, okay?) 'The Departed' opens with a handful of story tresses that are related but different. Each arc appears to be going the same direction, although the connection isn't immediately evident. But the big picture soon begins to come into focus as the strands are woven together. The noteworthy editing of Thelma Schoonmaker, who has chopped most of Scorsese's work, contributes mightily to this effect. Early on the movie is nearly disorienting, jumping rapidly from story to story at almost random intervals, as quickly as second by second. This fitfulness soon settles into a comfortable equilibrium, in part because one becomes accustomed to it, and in part because the stories braid themselves tighter and tighter.As the film finds its rhythm, it occasionally soars on the wings of its stellar cast. In their parallel roles, Leonardo DiCaprio continues to mature with his hard-edged part; Matt Damon plays an interesting spin-off of his altar-boy image, and as a local crime boss, Jack Nicholson is...well...Jack Nicholson. Even though the hard-nosed characters are not particularly likable in themselves, Scorsese takes the time to provide glimpses into the quieter parts of their lives, not just the adrenaline-pumping moments. Like the characters or not, this makes them more human, more interesting, and more worthy of sympathy. It also produces the movie's best moments, which are not entirely congruous with the rest of the film.As a Boston-based crime drama, 'Departed' virtually demands comparison to 2003's stellar 'Mystic River'. Clint Eastwood's film holds a few things high above Scorsese's, namely a soul. Like Kevin Bacon's detective, Vera Farmiga's fresh-faced police psychiatrist brings some semblance of a moral center to the project. But as she is sucked into the vortex of chicanery, she slowly blends into her surroundings like Darwin's peppered moths. Another key difference lies in the closing act. River didn't wrap things up cleanly, but satisfyingly left story arcs somewhat resolved while still open. 'Departed', on the other hand, tries too hard to tie a pretty bow on this occasional present to moviegoers, and that is where Scorsese's project disappoints most.Regardless of how strong a piece of rope appears at its center, the ends are what define much of its value. Likewise with a film, if the final act isn't finished well, the film loses much of its punch, as 'Departed' does. Rather than tie off the end or perhaps unbraid the story lines, Departed instead sloppily hacks off the end of the stories that pull the viewer along. The final scenes may seem like an acceptable finish upon initial glance, but a closer inspection reveals not a snip and a solder, but a absurdly quick chop-chop, a slovenly deus ex machina that jarringly diverges from the slow build of the previous two-plus hours. It almost feels like one of those wisely discarded alternate endings on a DVD, like something someone jokingly threw out as an lazy way to conclude matters.With its frequent outbursts of intense violence and words, hard-living characters, and twisty story lines, 'The Departed' is a Scorsese work through and through. At times the director, aided by a loaded cast, provides wildly entertaining moments and scenes. But like a couple of Steven Spielberg's recent movies ('War of the Worlds', 'Munich'), the discordant final act prevents this movie from attaining greater heights. Perhaps Departed could have joined the pantheon of mafia-type films ('Godfather I/II', 'Goodfellas'), but the late shortcomings prevent it from reaching even the strong second tier ('Untouchables', 'Road to Perdition', etc.).Bottom Line: A slow but steady start, a strong middle third, and a weak last act make 'The Departed' recommended only to those interested in seeing it for genre- or Oscar-related reasons. 6 of 10.",7,0,1,9 December 2006
War of the Worlds," I enjoyed it...right up until the last ten minutes.
","(Note: Major spoilers occur only in the clearly marked paragraph.) Spielberg. Cruise. Aliens. How can you go wrong? Well...With 'War of the Worlds', director Steven Spielberg has crafted a paradox: a movie with the subject of alien invasion that is more about familial relations. Similarly, the film treats the audience in an oxymoronic fashion: entertaining throughout yet leaving them unsatisfied as it follows the adventures of Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise, in a somewhat disorienting out-of-type role), who is a blue-collar New York City divorcée, and his semi-estranged children as they endure extra-terrestrials, each other, and everyone else.After the brief requisite introduction of characters, the wonderfully intimate portrayal of the dysfunctional father-child relationship (one of Spielberg's most frequent themes) embarks on a wildly successful roller coaster, both physically and emotionally. This dominant portion of the movie is very good, as Cruise and family encounter a raging mix of frightening aliens and equally scary people, some purposeful (the mobs) and some not (a creepy Tim Robbins), and explore their relationships in the process.I don't like to reveal much about a movie when I review it, but I feel the need...MAJOR SPOILERS IN THE NEXT PARAGRAPH!!! (clearing throat for rant) My biggest issue with 'War of the Worlds' is that too much didn't make sense, and I don't mean that in a scientific way. All of the momentum crashed and burned in the last moments, raising a cacophony of questions and providing few answers. You're telling me that these engineering geniuses bit it because they didn't get their shots? That's it?! I don't care if that's how the book ends; it's completely unsatisfying considering how badly they dominated us. Even the typical exploit-their-weakness ending ('Signs', every other alien movie) would have been sufficient. Beyond that, what is the purpose of the red vines/roots? Why were the machines affected by the atmosphere? Where is the backup? Why didn't the aliens take over the planet back when they buried their vehicles? And what are the freaking odds that the boy survived, let alone made it back to his grandparents' miraculously picturesque house while they were (from appearances) having tea?! I know that holes can be poked in most any sci-fi movie, but 1) a movie with this pedigree is going to be held to a higher standard than a fun romp like 'Independence Day'; and 2) all of these irksome questions immediately came to mind because they were not evidently answered, except for the purpose of cinematic convenience, which has its place, but not to this degree.END SPOILERS!!! (calming deep breaths) Featuring a less sweeping, more jittery score from stalwart John Williams, 'War of the Worlds' still manages to intensely entrance for ninety-plus minutes while displaying often violent interactions of humans and aliens, and it is a testament to Spielberg's ability that the movie overcomes the aforementioned obstacles for so long. Whether or not you like his work, you have to admit that there are few better storytellers, and his tools are on full display here. Rarely was I bored while watching, with a slightly muted color palette and plenty of eye-twinkling shots courtesy of Spielberg and his regular cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, like the handful of shots through holes in glass, tracking cameras along cracking pavement, and more. Making a big-idea movie is difficult enough without focusing on the small moments of father and daughter, but Spielberg balances the extremes well, and putting the viewer in the shoes of an everyman is ideally effective in retelling this classic tale. That talent merges well with the again excellent work from the effects team at Industrial Light & Magic, which creates alien beings congruent to and unique from (tripods...nice) previous cinematic incarnations, with a sci-fi realism that impresses throughout.For most of its running length, 'War of the Worlds' is very good, still not the great science-fiction that 'Minority Report' was, but very good. But even during that time, an inquisitive undercurrent flows, asking Where is this going?. Unfortunately that question is never satisfactorily answered, resulting in a bifurcated movie experience.Bottom Line: Enjoyable but ultimately disappointing. 6 of 10.",6,2,4,4 July 2005
Stranger Than Fiction," A missed opportunity for greatness.
","As the cinematic writing debut of Zach Helm, 'Stranger Than Fiction' may very well have the most creative storyline of the year. Harold Crick (Will Ferrell) is a nondescript IRS agent who awakes one day to hear a woman narrating much of his life. Unbeknownst to him at the time, the voice belongs to a well-known author who routinely kills her main characters in her novels. No big deal, except for the fact that he soon learns of his fate. That of course horrifies him, and he spends the majority of the film coping with that inevitability.Unfortunately the lofty possibilities raised by such a fantastically original idea are never fully explored. 'Stranger' doesn't take the time to delve into the life-and-death complexities that could arise from a man searching for the why and who behind his future demise. Nor does it address most of the unique moral questions and obligations that would arise. Instead the script settles for clichés like a typically rushed cinematic romance, premises that aren't all that bad, but are more suited to be side stories, not main arcs. These shortcomings glaringly keep Stranger from reaching the Oscar-winning level of something like 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' or other Charlie Kaufman work. In fact this movie might be best described as Diet Charlie Kaufman, a pop psychological movie, a thinking movie for those who don't really want to think.As Adam Sandler did for 'Punch-Drunk Love', Will Ferrell will no doubt receive heaps of praise for his portrayal of IRS agent Harold Crick. Make no mistake, Ferrell is fine, but don't let anyone convince you this is an Oscar-worthy turn. The simple fact that he plays it straight, without getting nearly naked or over-reacting doesn't automatically create a great performance. The reality is that while he has his moments, Ferrell is the straight man in this picture, a tepid character who contrasts well with Maggie Gyllenhaal's anarchist baker Anna, Dustin Hoffman's Yoda of literature professor, and Emma Thompson's work as author Kay Eiffel, which results in the best performance in the film. She lends the part a wackiness that seems genuinely fresh, in odd, unteachable ways like how she touches both sides of a door frame when passing. She acts crazy enough but not so crazy that you sense the acting as she neurotically haggles over how she can kill off her protagonist.In the end, 'Stranger Than Fiction' is like Anna's cookies. They both taste good at the time, as the movie does have its humorous and entertaining moments, but their long term value is limited due to their lack of nutrition. Nothing here is going to linger, but if you're interested, you won't be sorry you saw it.Bottom Line: A missed opportunity, but still worth a rental or cheap theater ticket. 6 of 10.",6,25,35,9 December 2006
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," When the Sith hits the fans.
","(Note: I reveal major details, but if you know what has to happen, there are no surprises.) 'Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith' faces an interesting narrative predicament, because not only does everyone know where it begins (picking up during the Clone Wars, a few years after 'Episode II' ended), they also know where it ends (about two decades before the original 'Star Wars' begins). This both abets and subverts the power of the film, which must be considered the best of the three recent installments. Knowing what must happen eliminates the suspense factor, but adds different emotional layers that more than adequately fill that void.As is expected from George Lucas and Industrial Light & Magic, the pervasive digital effects are excellent, forging worlds and creatures that delight the imagination. The film looks fantastic, probably too fantastic, absent the physicality and oddness of actual sets and scenery, of which there is little. This causes the actors to work against instead of with the backgrounds, depriving the film of a little reality, and giving it an almost cartoonish feel different than traditional celluloid products.The actors, particularly youngsters Natalie Portman and Hayden Christenson, have aged a few years since the first two prequels, as have their characters. This newfound maturity combines with the stronger emotion of the script to produce better but still occasionally wooden performances. The work as a whole is hindered by Lucas's again stilted dialogue, lacking the edgy attitude and sharp delivery that highlighted the original trilogy.'Episode III' waits until the halfway point to take off, spending the first hour setting the stage for the showdowns that everyone anticipates. Once the true conflict begins, the excitement makes the jump to light speed, climaxing with highly enjoyable intercutting light-saber battles that would be considered too lengthy if they were done with traditional swords. But come on, they're light-sabers. They're just cool.What differentiates 'Episode III' from the other prequels is the compelling emotion dripping from Anakin Skywalker. After two movies worth of buildup, the payoff finally arrives in the last hour, which is ridiculously engaging. Finally in this picture we see flashes of Anakin's potency, of why he will be (was?) referenced with such awe in the future. We also see the why and how of the mentally torturous process he endures in crossing over to the Dark Side. One would figure that this transition to Darth Vader would be a crowning villainous moment. But while that thought has some truth, the overwhelming emotion is instead sorrow, a surprising yet cinematic ally pleasing moment that generates sympathy and wistfulness as the pendulum swings drastically from good to evil. This is undoubtedly the emotional zenith of the prequels, and possibly all six movies.As just indicated, 'Episode III' derives most of its power from the rest of the films. Were the same components part of an unrelated movie, it wouldn't be nearly as enjoyable. But because of the engrossing nature of the world and strong characters created in the original trilogy, the entertainment value skyrockets. Simply seeing cinematic friends on screen again is a welcome sight. Joy is found in little things like the actions of Yoda and R2-D2, and in the filling out of one of the greatest movie stories ever.Bottom Line; It's Star Wars. 8 of 10.",9,2,4,25 May 2005
The Terminal," A Terminal-ly ill script grounds the best efforts of Spielberg and Hanks.
","Steven Spielberg. Tom Hanks. Catherine Zeta-Jones. This movie can't miss. Right? Right?! Um...wrong.'The Terminal' has a promising premise. Based on a true story, Tom Hanks is Viktor Navorski, an Eastern European immigrant stuck in the terrestrial version of Dante's limbo, a New York City airport, after a civil war breaks out in his home country. All he wants to do is fulfill a nebulous mission, but standing in his way is the airport's expedient head of security (Stanley Tucci), all of which sets up a standard fish-out-of-water story that has its moments but ultimately falls short.Mildly reminiscent of 'Cast Away', Hanks occasionally shines as a character out of his element, as his attention to small things and everyman qualities allow the viewer to play along as he scrapes by in an airport. (Besides, who hasn't been stuck in an airport for what seems like forever?) However his selective understanding of English raises eyebrows with its convenience, which is perhaps the overriding problem with 'Terminal'. Similarly, everything is simply too conducive to the direction of the story, without providing a foundation for such progression. Need two people to fall in love? Oh look, they happen to share a quirky passion. Need to jump ahead days or weeks? Thirty seconds of filler should suffice. Plus the partial truths and misunderstandings create the feeling of a teen comedy with a grown-up cast. ultra-realism isn't necessary, but too many decisions and communications (or lack thereof) are simply too implausible to take seriously.In less capable hands, 'Terminal' would have been unbearably buttery due to such faults; but the solid lead work of Hanks and Catherine Zeta-Jones, accompanied by good-as-usual supporting actors like Tucci, creates at least marginally interesting characters. Overall though, the characters hit one note and little more. Those notes are usually played well, but soon grow monotonous. Director Steven Spielberg's uncanny, sometimes grating, ability to generate emotional power also contributes to the enjoyability, which doesn't reach full speed until the final act, despite the attempts of John Williams's pleasantly upbeat score to zip the movie forward.This is because the motivation of Hanks's character is absent for first 90 minutes of the film. The idea is presumably to lure the audience along while wondering why, but the question is staged as a side attraction rather than the main event. Once revealed, that story arc finishes strong, but the film is then so far behind that it can't catch up, like a late but futile kick down the stretch of a track race.Like its main character who is limited by his surroundings, 'The Terminal' perseveres with what meager sustenance it has, but in the end not even the prominent talent of the participants can launch the movie past its mediocre story. The script surely looked much better on paper than on screen, and the movie reflects that, promising so much yet delivering so little.Bottom Line: A major disappointment. 5 of 10, and that's generous.",5,2,5,16 March 2005
Casino Royale," He'll kill you.
","In a cinematic world that is so often disappointing, a flick that knows its target and hits it squarely is always a welcome sight. Enter 'Casino Royale', the 21st and latest James Bond movie., featuring Daniel Craig in his debut as Agent 007. Because all Bond movies feature essentially the same parts, the differences arise from the quality of those parts and how they fit together, so allow me to examine the pieces...Story: 'Casino Royale' begins near the beginning, as Bond became Bond, earning his license to kill and diving headlong into the espionage world. This automatically adds depth and interest to the plot, because origin stories are almost always interesting (see: 'Batman Begins'), allowing for explanations of various Bond trademarks. That part of the plot is very good. As for the main storyline, it's about par for the course. There are the mandatory jaunts to beautiful locations like Miami and the Bahamas, and the flick pleasingly manages to avoid the high-tech gimmicky nature that plagued the recent movies. The centerpiece of the movie is a high-stakes poker game, and while I liked that, I wonder what non-players thought of those scenes. Being a poker player, I was able to call virtually every card, but that didn't erode much of the enjoyment, because Bond movies aren't renowned for their unpredictability.Villain: Meh. Mads Mikkelsen isn't given much to work with as Le Chiffre, a upper-class money launderer who affiliates with terrorists. Sure, he looks creepy, but that's about all we learn about him. The lack of a classic villain has been a major weakness of the recent Bond movies, and this one is no different. Without a memorable story or bad guy, 'Casino Royale' was forced to rely on other avenues for its quality. That was risky considering this is Daniel Craig's first turn as Agent 007. Fortunately...James Bond: Merely from the trailer, one could see that Craig brought different elements to Bond, and those glimpsed traits erupt into full view as the picture rolls. He doesn't quite have the suavity of Sean Connery or Pierce Brosnan, but more than any other Bond portrayer, Craig is physically imposing. He could kill you. He has an attitude that adds a modern hard edge to the Bond prototype, one that still oozes sexuality despite the dearth of the puns and double entendres that had become too ubiquitous in Bond movies lately. This is an installment more physical than any other, so both of those additions are very important and greatly appreciated.Bond Girls: The best Bond girls always have a more exotic look than the women that often dominate American cinema. There are two main female roles here; the Italian model-turned-actress Caterina Murino is a classic Bond vixen, exactly what you'd expect of an Italian model-turned-actress. Her role is secondary to that of Eva Green's (Kingdom of Heaven) Treasury agent Vesper Lynd. Her beauty doesn't leap off the screen early, as her character's bookish side dominates, but she later vamps it up with varying results. Sometimes she looks like a teenager girl playing dress-up, but when she tones down the glamour, she fits the mold well, if perhaps a little too understatedly. (Yes, it's a word.) Gadgetry: The number of gizmos in 'Casino Royale' are toned down significantly from prior versions. While they are missed in a nostalgic sense, they aren't missed within the context of this movie, because of the different action scenes, which segues nicely to...Action: The action scenes are infused with a physicality that sets this one apart from any of its predecessors. The black-and-white pre-credits sequence is a superb intro that has an indie feel, and the first extended chase will leave you exhausted in your seat. Bond is frequently bloodied and bruised as he He bleeds, and you feel it. That's a good thing.Many have said that 'Casino Royale' reminds of 'The Bourne Identity', a comparison that is understandable but slightly misguided. While the gritty look does call Bourne to mind, the overall tone is much more elevated. Bond is not an everyman like Jason Bourne; he wears a tuxedo and dabbles in high-stakes games of poker and espionage in which the fate of the world is on the line. That creates a loftier feel that makes potentially mundane scenes (and the entire movie) better and more enjoyable than they should be.Bottom Line: It's a Bond movie. And a pretty good one.

","**Minor Spoilers Ahead!!** I am a guy who generally shuns romantic movies, but I had always been intrigued by the simple premise of 'Before Sunrise', a 1995 film about a man and a woman who fall in love literally overnight. I never got around to seeing it until recently, when I had to watch it before seeing this year's sequel, 'Before Sunset' (not to be confused with the Pierce Brosnan/Salma Hayek pic 'After the Sunset').'Before Sunrise' stars Ethan Hawke as Jesse, a twenty-something American wandering through Europe by train, and Julie Delpy as Celine, a twenty-something French woman returning to Paris from a relative's funeral. They meet by chance on a train and eventually decide to while the night away in Vienna together, before Jesse's flight departs in the morning. The couple wanders around the city, getting to know each other and themselves better as they go. If that sounds simple, it is. The only other characters are those whom Jesse and Celine happen to encounter along the way.With such a basic storyline, the film relies entirely on the work of Hawke and Delpy. Fortunately the two conjure up an open honesty rarely seen on screen. They never seem to be acting, and their interactions are consistently fresh, as though they had been through separate rehearsals before showing up to work together. Their dialogue is casual without being overly so, but is still cautious enough to be appropriate for the given stage of the relationship.Beyond the words, the gestures complement the relationship superbly as well. The way their eyes avoid each other at first. The multiple times Jesse reaches out to almost touch Celine before thinking the better of it. How Celine coyly seems to enjoy being the object of his affection, then later saying exactly that, how she likes his eyes on her. These physical actions reinforce the verbal communication and elevate the picture to the next level of excellence.In my mind, 'Before Sunrise' portrays how falling love should be, except over a much longer period of time. There is a semi-awkward feeling-out stage, followed by sheer pleasure in the other's company, followed by the requisite bumps in the road, leading to an ultimately satisfying relationship. In less than two hours, 'Before Sunrise' presents as realistic a portrayal of love and interpersonal relations as I can recall, a sort of ultra-compact 'When Harry Met Sally...' filled with honest and open dialogue that is wonderfully free of melodrama. That absence will vex some, particularly those accustomed to the over-the-top romance of most American movies, but those with patience will experience a well-told story about human interaction.The film is not perfect, as certain third act decisions will send the approval of some through the roof, disappoint a few (me), and cause yet others to be wildly indifferent. This all depends on the personality of the viewer, as the final scenes will cause you to genuinely ponder what you want the characters to do, and what you would do under similar circumstances. Despite my selective antipathy, that's a sign of a good and effective film, one that causes people to take sides as they determine what should, would, and could occur.'Before Sunrise' is a predecessor to recent critics' darlings like 'Lost in Translation' and 'Garden State', a film that uses self-exploratory conversation to advance the basic story. If you liked either of those films, you should appreciate this one, and if you liked this one, check out the sequel, which is now on DVD.Bottom Line: Eight of ten, which considering the subject matter, is high praise indeed.",8,3,5,8 December 2004
Live Free or Die Hard," Best action movie of the year.
","If you're worn out by the relentless parade of movie heroes sporting tights or transforming into robots, good news currently awaits you at the theater: 'Live Free or Die Hard', a physical, action-packed antidote to comic book movies, which is the fourth chapter in the cinematic adventures of Detective John McClane. Having already survived Germans at Nakatomi Plaza, revolutionaries at Dulles Airport, and more Germans in New York City, McClane (Bruce Willis) is once again in the wrong place at the right time, as his simple task morphs into yet another odds-defying assignment.Willis brings back his familiar character with a pitch-perfect blend of world-weariness and cocksure attitude. While he's saving the country, McClane has an innate ability to blend comedy with capability, willingly hurling unsavory nicknames and spewing determined anger rather than blandly yet skillfully executing his mission. Live Free separates itself from traditional action/adventure movies by organically working the humor into the fabric of the movie, rather than lazily relying on comic relief characters or contrived situations. Justin Long, perhaps most recognizable as the Mac guy in Apple's television ads, plays off Willis well as he is sucked into the chaotic events, with a defensive sarcasm and semi-rebellious side that effectively embody his role as a twenty-something computer hacker.The comedy isn't the selling point of the 'Live Free' though. The trailer promised huge effects, and the movie delivers in a BIG way. Over-sized vehicles ranging from semi trucks to fighter jets are involved in adrenaline-pumping confrontations, and of equal importance, they bob and weave in relatively sensible ways. As opposed to the incomprehensible massive chaos of 'Transformers', there is an elegance to the action here. It's still over-the-top, but in an linear, choreographed manner that is easily followed and relished. Even though many of the stunts undoubtedly use CGI, the old-school physicality provides a sharp and enjoyable contrast to the digital attack the enemy is unleashing on the United States, as well as the cartoon-ish nature of many comic book movies.'Live Free' has its share of improbability, as characters survive dangerous falls and endure endless physical abuse, and the technology sometimes seems all too easy. But in a movie like this, such conveniences are accepted if not expected as part of the genre. This isn't a serious Oscar contender with grand themes or undertones; it's summertainment, a popcorn movie designed as a diverting escape. In that regard it succeeds wildly, inducing winces, yells, and cheers from the audience.One interesting note is that this rendition of Die Hard is rated 'only' PG-13, no doubt in an attempt to lure the lucrative teenage demographic. Some will be outraged by this apparent neutering of a franchise that was largely defined through the the R-rating earned by the pervasive vulgarities of the first three installments. Even the signature line (Yippee-ki-yay...) is obscured by sound effects. On one hand it's disappointing that Hollywood acquiesced to the almighty dollar. On the other hand the absence of a constant barrage of language is scarcely missed, as McClane's aggressive attitude is still intact, accompanied by plenty of derogatory terms that are not quite as profane. Maybe he mellowed with age.Bottom Line: The best action movie so far this year. A rock solid 7 of 10.",7,0,1,14 July 2007
X2: X-Men United," Too Dam Much.
","**Warning! Plot Spoilers Ahead!**There's a reason that most superhero movies feature a sole titular character ('Superman', 'Spiderman', 'Daredevil', etc.).  Delving into the life of one such person is plenty of story for one movie.  'X2' perfectly illustrated the opposite situation.  The major flaw with the original 'X-Men' was the lack of development of a few characters, like Cyclops and Storm, who were basically defined by their powers.  Wolverine and Rogue were fleshed out, but that was about it.  So what did director Bryan Singer and company do for the sequel?  That's right...more characters!!  While some new mutants are hashed out well (Nightcrawler), others are one-dimensional (Deathstrike...what was her purpose?  Just to fight Wolverine because Stryker couldn't?), or don't have enough screen time (Pyro, Colossus...I hope they are featured more in the inevitable sequels). Plus the veteran mutants whose backstories were shafted in the original were largely ignored again (Storm...seriously, tell me one thing about her character besides her power...or Mystique...any idea why she's bad?).  With so many people and storylines, it is difficult to truly become involved in each character and thus the story as a whole.  That is the core problem, one that is woven through the entire movie. Having said that, I enjoyed much of this movie, which provided many  moments of sheer entertainment.  The opening scene of Nightcrawler wreaking havoc on the White House, brilliantly accompanied by Mozart's Requiem, was an excellent introduction to both Nightcrawler and the movie.  Unfortunately, that was the highlight of 'X2.'  The scene of Pyro going psycho on the local cops was quite good, and I liked how that sequence was resolved.  Other scenes, like the invasion of the mansion and Magneto's escape, were entirely enjoyable; but there were also random scenes, such as Mystique's seduction of Wolverine.  The latter parts enhanced the unfulfilled desire to learn more about other characters, as they seemed to be part of a larger story that was shaved down in the final cut.    The end sequence at the dam was the other major problem I had.  Too many disparate things were occurring simultaneously, and it took too long to resolve them all.  We know roughly what's going to transpire, so get on with it already.  That's another byproduct of so many characters.  And that series of events also raised the single biggest question I had:  Why didn't Iceman just freeze the dam water?  Wouldn't that have solved everything?  I suppose there is an unexplained reason behind this, but I couldn't discern it.  That unanswered query only exacerbated my frustration with the finale. And the ending quote was plain silly.  Everyone knows the social message that all 'X-Men' stories are supposed to have.  Was it really necessary to beat the audience over the head with that point?  Quit trying to turn entertainment into politics.  Given the circumstances of making a follow-up to 'X-Men', I'm not sure how the sequel could have been improved.  More characters were virtually demanded by fans, and merely pitting the good mutants against the bad mutants wasn't going to work again.  The end result is a movie that was highly entertaining and visually arresting at times, but also lacked the necessary depth and character development to step beyond popcorn flick status.  Bottom Line:  Wildly fun at points, but there was 'X2' much to cover.  6 out of 10.",6,0,0,13 May 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Awe-evoking.
","**Warning! Mild Spoilers Ahead!!**Sequels are inherently difficult to make and review review, because on top of the usual expectations for a film, everyone has to deal with expectations created by the previous films. Return of the King faced expectations equal to those of any other film, and like the protagonists at Helm's Deep, fended them off and crushed them.ROTK begins where 'The Two Towers' concluded. As Gandalf said at the end of TTT, 'The battle for Helm's Deep is over; the battle for Middle Earth has begun.' Frodo & Sam are still moving toward Mordor; Merry & Pippin are hanging out w/ the Ents at Isengard; and the rest of the fellowship has defeated the Uruk-hai at Helm's Deep. With Saruman defeated, the focus now shifts east, where man must make a final stand against Sauron, while Frodo & Sam attempt to destroy the One Ring.As opposed to the breakneck opening scenes of TTT, ROTK starts slowly, but the early character development in lieu of action sequences is equally enjoyable and enlightening. Thank goodness for the deliberate beginning though, because if the intensity of the latter two-thirds of the film lasted for the full running time, paramedics would have been required on site to assist with heart failures and burst blood vessels, inevitable side effects of the remarkable tension that director Peter Jackson creates.
Speaking of Jackson, let's hear it for him and his crew (pause for standing ovation).That crew has once again created a mythical world without a trace of fictitiousness. Through the jaw-dropping visualization of massive battles, fortresses, monsters, and more, the cinematography and effects uphold and improve the standard set by the predecessors. Gollum now has more to work with as an 'actor', and the digital whiz kids step up to the challenge, blending him into the shots perfectly, particularly in a brilliant reflection scene. More sweeping battle scenes and more gorgeous landscapes are among the stellar shots lensed by Andrew Lesnie. The first shot of Minas Tirith stands to be my movie moment of the year; it will absolutely take your breath away. But the beauty lies in the fact that you scarcely know the difference between beautiful reality and equally natural effects. Outside of a couple apparent blue-screen shots, I never once doubted the veracity of the world of Middle Earth. Considering the enormity of that task, those at WETA Workshop who dazzled us with their talent deserve every award they get over the next couple months.On the musical front, Howard Shore is back as composer, and his work shines as never before. He provides grand and booming orchestral sounds when battles require them, yet still manages to evoke emotion without lapsing into melodrama during poignant scenes. Mixing and tweaking familiar themes with new melodies, Shore literally hits all the right notes. For the audience, picking out recognizable themes, such that of Rohan or the Fellowship, and hearing how Shore has kicked them into a minor key or altered those last two notes is a thrill. His score is a joy to listen to, both as it seamlessly meshes with the film and on its own. Perhaps there can be no higher compliment.Also of note is the use of vocal music voiced by the actors themselves, a technique that is new to the theatrical releases of LOTR. Of the two songs, I must mention the first one, which is utilized to stunning maximum effect. In a remarkable scene reminiscent of The Godfather, the song is sung over a scene that cuts between a character who made a decision and the grim consequences of that choice. The music, pictures, and variations in film speed combine for one of the best scenes of the year.None of the acting work stood out to me, and by that I mean no individual was head-and-shoulders above the rest. I could still make a legitimate Oscar case for at least four cast members (Astin, McKellen, Mortensen, Wood), which is a tribute to the overall strength of the ensemble cast. Everyone fits into and builds upon their roles so very well, and the camaraderie that I've seen glimpses of behind the scenes carries over wonderfully.
The acting serves as a means rather than an end. A la 'Band of Brothers', the combined ten hours of film allow time for the characters to be developed and known, an advantage fully used in ROTK, which has more fulfilling scenes packed with emotion where we see decisions being made. Those scenes are what elevate this film to another level. On top of the nonpareil action sequences that shame other 'epics', it has a human soul, one that comes to the fore in final act, when the friendships that have been established take center stage. To me, friendship is the core theme of LOTR, and thanks to the fabulous acting of all participants, that theme is displayed in all its glory in ROTK.WARNING! THE NEXT PARAGRAPH DISCUSSES THE CLOSING SCENES!!
In an unusual but welcome departure from the cinematic norm, the denouement of ROTK lasts a good twenty minutes after the climax. Too many movies, like 'Matrix Revolutions', wrap too quickly, leaving fates either unresolved or resolved, but sloppily and unsatisfactorily. Others, such as 'Pirates of the Caribbean', do have an extended ending but don't require one and thus fill it with fluff. Here we find a perfect mean. Considering that Jackson and company have over ten hours of film and numerous character arcs to wrap up, twenty minutes is probably the minimum required to let the audience absorb all that has happened. After three or four possible end points, each of which concludes various stories, Sam returns to the Shire and enters his home, closing the door on both the camera and the trilogy. While the finish may seem odd, I consider it perfect. Sam has just come to the end of a fantastic adventure, a journey mirrored by that of the audience. The ending leaves each party back where they began, in a satisfying yet admittedly bittersweet manner. Like it or not, 'I'm back.'END OF MAJOR SPOILERS.Is this film perfect? Probably not. Sure, certain characters like Denehor could have been developed more. But while that knowledge would have been helpful, the time it would have taken to expound on those people likely would not have been worth the knowledge gained. There are a handful of other cardinal sins, such as scarcely showing the ultimate villain and Arwen's near random appearances. But most of those trace back to the original books, not to errors by Peter Jackson. The fact that the entire series works so well without fully disclosing many details speaks to the phenomenal power of Tolkien's books and superb work in Jackson's films. The bottom line is that nobody cares about the flaws because they're entranced by the literary and cinematic magic on display.Bottom Line: ROTK, the greatest final film in a trilogy of all time (go ahead...name a better one) culminates the best overall film trilogy ever, ten hours of film that transcend the medium. As I told my brother as we reluctantly but contentedly departed the theater, we will never experience anything like this again.  EVER.  10/10.",10,8,9,22 December 2003
Munich," Good, but a missed opportunity
","Steven Spielberg's 'Munich' is a return to the director's serious nature. Although the spy thriller subject matter is closer to 'Minority Report' than 'Schindler's List', the tone is far more like 'Saving Private Ryan' than 'War of the Worlds', an interesting dichotomy that both aids and abets the film.'Munich' is inspired by true events that occurred after 1972 Olympics tragedy in the titular city. After several Israeli athletes are taken hostage and murdered by Palestinian terrorists, the Israeli government recruits five men to exact revenge (read: assassinate) upon those who initiated the kidnapping. The movie concentrates on the drama of quintet's actions and transformations as they undertake their collective task, viewing like a taut thriller, but featuring more development among both characters and plot.Where 'Munich' diverges from typical espionage movies is also where it predominantly excels. The reality of everything distances this film from even good genre flicks like 'The Bourne Identity', not necessarily in quality but in nature, because the fully realized actions and consequences of 'Munich' create an entirely different, more genuine world. The main characters, acted to a tee, all face moral dilemmas, evolving wonderfully through the quieter in-between scenes and more impressively during the more intense portions. Likewise the pace eschews the typically breakneck, impulsive speed at which most such films flow, opting instead for a deliberate approach that accelerates when necessary, making those moments all the more gripping. But the handful of pin-you-to-your-seat scenes are not enough to carry the entire film.Steven Spielberg is a remarkable storyteller, a fact reinforced by manner in which he balances the action and character, continually bouncing between assassination attempts and dialogue-heavy development scenes. At times though this unevenness, accented by two discordant scenes, robs the film of a driving sense of urgency, leaving one with the feeling that it coulda/woulda/shoulda been better. One of those scenes, involving revenge, is shocking and discomforting, but at least effectively makes its contrasting point. The other, one of the closing scenes, is flat awkward, an ill fit both chronologically and emotionally. So out-of-place are these two moments that they nearly overshadow two hours of impressive drama.Of course, this is nearly a three hour film, but would have fared better had it been trimmed down or at least reorganized. The decision to reenact the events of 'Munich' was not a bad one, and it provides some of the movies most lasting images with classic archive footage and the reproduction of known moments from alternate angles. But intercutting these scenes over the course of the film interrupts the flow, particularly since the flashbacks are portrayed through the thoughts of a character who wasn't even there.Despite the uniqueness, the film never kicks things to the next level. 'Munich' is always interesting, but rarely captivating, thanks to some combination of factors. Maybe the minimal amount of music retards the drama. Maybe the tone of the heavy subject matter isn't conducive to Spielberg's style of story-telling. Perhaps though, more than anything, one can't help but think like the main character, wondering what the point is and where everything is going. Big and difficult questions are asked, which is commendable. These are emotions and choices that are notably similar to those felt and made in today's post-9/11 world, making Munich a still pertinent film that has the chance to be immensely powerful. But the answers provided are either non-existent or too simple, leaving the viewer feeling cold.Bottom Line: Still good, occasionally brilliant, but ultimately less than it could have been. 7 of 10, recommended only if you're interested.",7,1,2,25 January 2006
Sin City," A finely crafted piece of garbage.
","With the most appropriate movie title in recent memory, 'Sin City' is likely to be divisive among moviegoers, and more interestingly within a moviegoer. Rarely has such a dichotomy existed between technical prowess and moral & narrative bankruptcy.'Sin City' is an anthology of three stories set in the noir-ish, crime-riddled metropolis of Frank Miller's graphic novels (he also co-directed). Each segment has its own storyline with unique characters, although they do transpire simultaneously in the same space, running roughly parallel rather than criss-crossing. This gives the movie a fractured and episodic nature that limits its overall narrative power, inexplicably dragging despite its breakneck action and pace.Shot by jack-of-all-trades Robert Rodriguez in sumptuous black-and-white, high-definition digital video, the movie was done largely in front of green screen, with flashes of color and cityscapes that are primarily CGI meshing seamlessly with the live action to produce some of the best and most pervasive visual effects ever seen. In the process, the sheer visceral look of the picture entrances, as each shot seems worthy of being frozen and hung on a wall due to the slightly out of kilter comic-book style framing. This careful craftsmanship and attention to detail plunges the audience so deep into an alternative world that it's almost enough to distract from the complete absence of any moral compass. Almost.As fantastic and jaw-dropping as the visuals are, the principles of 'Sin City' are equally heinous, emphasizing the dark side of the monochromatic world. There are no white-hat heroes, and even the protagonists are villainous. The only remotely good character is Bruce Willis's detective, who would fill the 'bad cop' role in most worlds. But his aggressive approach, which is not by the book to say the least, falls on the tame end of the the movie's violent methods spectrum, which combines the bloodiness of 'Kill Bill' with the brutality of 'The Punisher'. I can sometimes accept such actions if the motives are somewhat pure (the relatively justifiable homicides of either aforementioned movie for instance), but such motives here are minimal at best and predominantly non-existent.Don't get me wrong. I don't necessarily require high morality out of my movies. I'm not demanding the pure motives of Frodo or Atticus Finch, but give me something to latch onto, some semblance of a moral reference point. Someone like Kevin Bacon's flawed but justice-seeking cop in the murky crime drama 'Mystic River', which was based in a right-and-wrong world even as it portrayed a darker side. Even a sliver of ethics will do, but there is nary a sliver to be found in 'Sin City'. Even people who are 'supposed' to be good are likewise black-hearted. Without any sort of orientation, the movie stumbles over itself throughout. I realize that is the nature of the source material; and I accept that, commending Rodriguez and Miller for their cinematic vision, while simultaneously reeling from the depraved soul of the books.With a cast of familiar names and faces that you can't count using your fingers and toes, the acting of 'Sin City' is...well, it's there. No one except perhaps the disappointing Michael Madsen (who apparently thought he was still on 'Tilt') detracts from the film, but no one is given much opportunity to supply good work either. Most of the parts are virtually interchangeable, requiring merely an attractive stone face. The casting and appearance are therefore all the more praiseworthy, as image overrides and dwarfs character development. Fortunately the celebrity never distracts from the movie, but rather produces an aura of respectability in what would likely have been regarded as an awful B-grade flick without such star power.Despite my major ethical issues, I still find myself getting juiced whenever I espy artwork from the film. It looks that good. But I still don't recommend it. The bifurcated 'Sin City' excels in every technical aspect, but the heart is cold, and the story is shattered.Bottom Line: Like Snow White's polished apple, 'Sin City' gleams on the outside, concealing a rotten core that ultimately disheartens and disappoints. 6 of 10 at best, exclusively for technical merit.",6,2,4,8 April 2005
The Bourne Supremacy," Solid, but not as good as the original.
","**Minor Spoilers Ahead!**'The Bourne Supremacy 'picks up about two years after the original ended. Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) and his girl Marie (Franka Potente) now reside in India, attempting to hide from the world of espionage. Of course that world finds them, yanking Bourne back into action, where he encounters a web of murder and money that forces him to confront semi-suppressed memories of his past missions. 'Identity' worked marvelously in part because it placed the audience firmly in the proverbial shoes of first Bourne, then also Marie, allowing everyone to learn simultaneously. In lieu of the aforementioned method, 'Supremacy' relies more on emotional connection. With bookend sequences that generate sympathy, the movie emphasizes Bourne's humanity more than its predecessor, which permits more connection with the characters, although not necessarily more involvement in the story. The smaller role of the aforementioned technique renders 'Supremacy' a more traditional action movie, and a vengance flick to be precise. As he unravels the truth and seeks revenge on those who took from him, Bourne is both hunter and hunted, confronting semi-suppressed memories of past missions along the way.
All pertinent characters who were alive at the conclusion of Identity return here, played by the same actors. Damon is again quite good, adding a sense of weariness to Bourne, while continuing to carry him properly for one with such training. Potente is not as alluring as a blonde, but still glows as the beauty and sole friend for whom Bourne fights. The primary new face is Joan Allen as a task force chief who investigates Bourne's involvement in a homicide robbery. With her sharp features and all-business attitude, she steps confidently and capably into a part that often clashes with Brian Cox's fatigued but industrious government official. Julia Stiles returns in a similarly minor role, and Karl Urban (Eomer in 'LOTR') rounds out the familiar faces as a cold-hearted and stone-faced Russian assassin. The parts add up to an again effective ensemble cast that is unfortunately under-utilized. In place of the compelling acting of 'Identity' is a relative over-reliance on action. Director Paul Greengrass replaces Doug Liman at the helm, and perhaps since this is his first major motion picture, 'Supremacy' is a little too shaky, both figuratively and literally. Greengrass doesn't possess as sure a hand as Liman (who produced the sequel), as evidenced by the movie's lesser emanation of confidence. The first film, headed by the interaction of Damon and Potente, drove forward steadily throughout. With their shared screen time limited, this movie slows occasionally, despite an expanded set of action scenes. The preponderance of such sequences, which should provide meaningful contrast to the valuable intimate moments, instead add to the cliches, producing a more traditional picture that doesn't flounder, but doesn't excel either. Additionally, the cinematography of the returning Oliver Wood and the editing of Richard Pearson & Christopher Rouse are slightly off-kilter, proving that less is more and that Aristotle's Golden Mean still reigns. The trio again uses what was so enjoyable in Identity, moving and handheld shots and nervous editing that simulate Bourne's mental state. But they overuse the techniques, apparently not knowing that how much is as important as what. The jumpiness is so prevalent that the hand-to-hand combat sequences in particular are occasionally hard to follow, and that in turn disrupts the flow enough to be distracting. Bottom Line: Despite (or perhaps because of) a more complicated story, the final product is a movie not as crisp or character-driven as the original. Thanks to a very good cast, 'The Bourne Supremacy' is still worth a viewing, meriting 7 of 10.",7,1,2,23 July 2004
Dodgeball," The degeneration of Ben Stiller continues.
","**Warning! Minor Spoilers Ahead!**Imagine you're a world famous chef (Bear with me, this is going somewhere...honest.) preparing a pasta dish for a big competition. You've rounded up the best possible ingredients, and whipped up a picture perfect meal. The homemade pasta is perfect; the chicken appears to be seasoned ideally; and the cream sauce is to die for. It all looks great on the table, except for one thing: you unintentionally used sugar instead of salt in the marinade, literally leaving the judges with an unpleasant taste in their mouths. The sauce and pasta are still good, but the dissonant taste of the chicken ruins the entire dish. That's 'Dodgeball'. The concept drips with comic potential: an underdog dodgeball team, led by Vince Vaughn, faces off against the Goliath of the sport, a squad captained by Ben Stiller (in his fourth and perhaps worst movie of 2004). That's a typical sports movie storyline, infused with Stiller's usually stellar humor. The cast, primarily Vaughn and Stiller, are top comedic actors who have proven their talents multiple times. But the flavoring provided by two-thirds of the script dooms the entire film to mediocrity at best. Maybe Stiller needs Owen Wilson back to write him a passable script. The title and hilarious trailer present the premise of the movie, but don't warn of the sixty minutes of filler that surround the games themselves. The basic setup of competing gyms is funny, and once finally reached thirty minutes in, the dodgeball scenes are comic gold. It's dodgeball for crying out loud. Just typing that makes me laugh. Televised on ESPN8, The Ocho, the championship tournament and its ethnically diverse teams provide the movie's best laughs. But in the meantime the movie struggles in ways that many sports movies do, as pointless, often crass, story arcs futilely attempt to inject romance and purpose into the games. I realize that the movie has to be longer than half an hour, but the quality comedy of dodgeball deserves better than bad SNL support. Stiller inadvertently explains the problem with his movie in the worst credits sequence I've ever seen. He mockingly complains that audiences are looking for mindless entertainment, ironically having just sated that very group of people. Instead of producing razor-sharp satire like 'Zoolander', Stiller and his crew have degenerated into substandard crude comedy (and I use the term loosely) reminiscent of (gasp) 'BASEsketball'. The last ten minutes are a prime example. After the inevitable climax, not a single line or scene is necessary. It's nothing but crude and lazy fluff, stretching the running time to a palatable 90 minutes. The cast and crew have proven they can produce good to great comedy without resorting to puerile tactics and endless joke repetition. Better is expected here, especially of Stiller, who also co-produced 'Dodgeball'. He has churned out comedic hits like 'Keeping the Faith', 'Meet the Parents', and 'Zoolander', all of which were often roll-on-the-floor funny without waaaay over-the-top violence and innuendo. On the minimal plus side, Stiller and Vaughn are still their usual solid selves, although most of the stale jokes seem to be recycled from their other work. Perhaps because Stiller seems to be working so hard to earn laughs, Vaughn shines as the straight man. Nothing he does is inherently humorous, in fact I don't think he even performed all that well, but within the context of such an overblown movie, his subdued everyman actions occasionally strike a comedic chord. Christine Taylor is again adequate, playing almost the same character she did in 'Zoolander', a role that demands little. Rip Torn is the right man for his part as a crotchety old ex-dodgeball star, but his excessive crudeness and violence doesn't play right, although his departure from the movie does provide one of its funnier moments. As a standard assortment of misfits and musclemen, no one else does much of anything worth mentioning, except for a few strong cameo appearances that leave you wishing for more. Technically, there's not much to say. Comedies such as this, even the good ones, are rarely notable (in a good or bad manner) for editing or score, and form holds here. The only noteworthy accomplishment is the horrific use of Chris De Burgh's classic ballad 'Lady in Red'. The movie raised various unanswerable questions. What's the deal with the pirate? How many times am I supposed to laugh at a guy getting hit in the groin? Do the financial aspects at the end actually make sense? Why did I pay money to see this garbage? These queries are unanswerable because by the time the movie stumbles to a halt, your brain will be numb, and you won't care enough to try a logical response. With the subtitle of 'A True Underdog Story', perhaps 'Dodgeball' was hoping to spawn a sequel. I hope that it does. Perhaps that one will find the missing two-thirds of this movie and live up to the potential promised by the premise and talent. Bottom Line: Less than half of a great movie gets less than half of a great rating.  4 of 10, and that might be generous.",4,1,2,21 June 2004
