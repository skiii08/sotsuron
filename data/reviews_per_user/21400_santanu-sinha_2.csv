Black Swan," A masterpiece
","A perfectionist ballerina Nina Sayers (played by the delicate Natalie Portman) gets the role all ballerinas crave all their lives, the lead role in Swan Lake. We follow her into her coming of age, to break the repressive boundaries, that she has been confined in all her life, to transcend herself to another plane.Just like 'The Wrestler' (another masterpiece by the great Darren Aronofsky) this is an emotional roller-coaster ride. Framed as a sort of dark psychological thriller, the movie, like it's lead, transcends the boundaries of genres towards the end to become the best movie I have seen this year.Natalie Portman is Nina Sayers. I mean, she 'is' Nina Sayers. She is the alpha and the omega of the movie. Remember Mickey Rourke from The Wrestler? This movie is about Natalie Portman. She gives, what can only be described as, the acting performance of the year. However, make no mistake, the supporting cast are very good and make convincing cases for the roles they play.I could not but save a separate line to mention the background score. Mostly derived from the Swan Lake, the music really gets you into the mood. The movie would not be what it is but for the haunting music.On the technical side, cinematography is very good, and in tone with the dark theme of the movie.In short, go get a ticket and see the movie in a theater. This is Hollywood at it's best.",10,0,2,15 January 2011
Quantum of Solace," A search for salvation
","Saw this last Friday, the first day of release in my country. First of all consider this to be a sequel to 'Casino Royale'. Not that it's a bad thing, but the experience would be better if you have seen Casino Royale. The story revolves around a Bond who has been mortally wounded in the heart by the betrayal by Vesper Lynd in Casino Royale. He tries to reconcile himself to the fact that she is no more, in the process becoming a reckless (to the verge of being suicidal) and vengeful killing machine. There is indeed a plot, unlike what some of the comments on the message boards would like you too believe. Oh yes, there is action, a lot of it, I might add, as bond travels around the globe fighting a powerful group of terrorists. However, the fight is as much with himself as with the others. The plot only acts as a beacon for bond's search for salvation. A search for a guarantee that the love that he once had was real and not a passionless game played upon him by the beautiful Vesper Lynd. Beyond all the mind numbing (and beautifully shot) action is actually a desperate man trying to get back to touch with reality. How is it comparable to the other bond movies? I don't know, I have seen them all, but I think it's like comparing apples and carrots. It's a good movie, go with an open mind and you will surely like it a lot.",8,1,4,10 November 2008
