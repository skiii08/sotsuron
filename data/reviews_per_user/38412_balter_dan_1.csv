Iron Man 3," Why, Marvel, Why?
","I've always been intrigued by superhero movies. Will the story be more about personal conflict, or will it be about the villain? Iron Man was an insanely good movie, 2 was disappointing, and this third one was bad. The Mandarin was a complete and utter joke of a character (which was a waste of Ben Kingsley's talents). He had no rings of power. In fact he had no powers at all. This, on top of Stark having armor that could withstand the mighty hits of Thor in the Avengers yet broke apart countless times from blows nowhere near as powerful as the God's, made this an altogether bad experience for me. Why it was ever approved like this is far beyond me.",4,2,5,11 June 2013
