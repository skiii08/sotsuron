Spartacus," Laughton and Ustinov
","It's true, Kirk Douglas' Spartacus is one of the strongest and most convincing heroes in movie history (maybe second only to his performance in PATHS TO GLORY, also directed by Stanley Kubrick).Still, there are two characters stealing the show: Peter Ustinov's slave dealer and especially Charles Laughton's Gracchus. Their scenes together are a rare gem. Never have serenity and tragedy been blended so perfectly. What a fine actor Laughton was!P.S.: Don't you ever compare this one with the dreadful GLADIATOR. It's an insult. In GLADIATOR the focus is on endless and cruel fight sequences. In SPARTACUS, in spite of 10,500 extras, the focus is on the actors.",9,3,6,29 May 2004
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Masterpiece of consistency
","I cannot understand people lamenting, that LSTSB has too many characters and too many subplots. In my opinion the movie's big achievement is that the viewer can follow these characters and these subplots very easily. It's a masterpiece of consistency. To me, consistency is the most important element for a good movie and 95 percent of the movies we get fail in it. It must be added, of course, that LSTSB has also a hilarious and witty dialogue (maybe the swearing is a little bit overdone), a perfect soundtrack and a breathtaking cinematography.",9,0,0,7 June 2001
The Untouchables," Could have been much better
","THE UNTOUCHABLES is an enjoyable movie and I rated it 7/10. Although it lacks character development, it includes enough suspense to keep you involved for nearly two hours. I particularly admired the sequence in the railway station. But there is one thing I cannot understand: It's the fuss everybody makes about the performance of Sean Connery. One former comment stated that Robert de Niro didn't play the role of Al Capone but the role of Robert de Niro. I think de Niro did the best out of the few and short scenes which the script provided for him. But Connery? I would say that Connery played Connery. Or even worse: He played James Bond, disguised as a Chicago cop. Once again the script is to blame: It doesn't give us the slightest hint, why an ordinary cop, who is doing street patrols, should suddenly become the leader of a 'gang', which challenges the all-mighty villain Al Capone and his unscrupulous hitmen. Connery's character must be one man with an interesting past, but we don't get any information about it.",7,1,4,25 January 2004
Gladiator," Ridley Scott loses against the Computer
","As a former comment stated, the first twenty minutes of GLADIATOR are unique in the historic genre. The adversities of the winter in Germania's hinterland and its barbarous inhabitants are displayed very realistically. This breathtaking effort will not be surpassed for decades to come. But afterwards??? It seems like Ridley Scott's work was done. The computer took over - a big mistake. Digital Rome, digital Forum, digital Colosseum, even digital people - so obvious, that the film becomes more and more similar to an 'Asterix'-Cartoon. The plot... well, what plot?? It disappeared somewhere between two fighting scenes. And another very disturbing thing about GLADIATOR is, that every single line is spoken in such an over-significant way, that it could be as well the final line of the movie. Every time I thought: 'No line can outdo this superb quotation'. But it goes on and on and on... There's more to a good movie than exceptional fighting-sequences.",4,0,1,18 July 2000
