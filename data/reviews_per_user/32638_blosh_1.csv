The Blair Witch Project," Quirky new horror concept
",The Blair Witch Project is a nice departure from the normally disgusting and tepid slasher flicks we've all seen at some point on our way from puberty to adulthood.  The concept is unique and the acting pretty good for relative unknowns. The one problem I had was all of the positive buzz going in.  I was so afraid to be completely freaked out at the theater that I may have been expecting too much.  I walked out of the theater actually wishing that there were more 'night shots' in the movie. The movie is full of suspense and will need another viewing to be complete. It ends very quickly leaving you wondering what in the hell just happened.,7,0,0,9 August 1999
