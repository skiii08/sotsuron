The Blair Witch Project," The most creative independent film I have ever seen.
","No matter what anyone says, you must see this movie.  I had the privilege of screening this movie at the Sundance Film Festival when there was no hype whatsoever.  And not knowing beforehand if this was a real documentary allowed me to experience more fear in a movie theater than I have ever encountered before.The best way to watch this movie is to not know ANYTHING about it.  If you see an interview on TV- don't watch it.  Or an article in a newspaper- don't read it.  And the worst thing you can do is compare it with other horror films. Unless you are a movie buff wizard, you have never seen anything like this before.  Just go see this movie with no expectations other than you're going to be entertained.Trust me.",Null,1,1,30 July 1999
Event Horizon," whatever you do, don't see this movie
","This is the only movie that I go out of my way to recommend to people NOT to see.  If I hadn't misjudged the previews, I would have never seen it in the theater.  I should have walked out.It wasn't scary- Event Horizon didn't tickled you with fear the way normal horror movies do.  The graphic images of blood and gore made you jump, then 3 seconds later made you jump again.  It wasn't scary, it was annoying. And I can normally stomach anything on screen.PLEASE, IF YOU'RE THINKING OF RENTING THIS MOVIE, YOU ARE MAKING THE WRONG DECISION!",2,2,5,30 July 1999
