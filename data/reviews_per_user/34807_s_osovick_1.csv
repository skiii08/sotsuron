United 93," United 93 is Unforgettable
","Paul Greengrass has achieved the nearly impossible. He has created a film about a sensitive subject which is often (insensitively) exploited for political gain or propaganda without using any of the clich√©s or gimmicks which so often permeate dramatic re-tellings. By using low profile, yet indisputably competent actors, he adds realism to a dramatization that could have been hindered by recognizable stars. Case in point; Oliver Stone's misguided casting of Nicholas Cage in his WTC movie.United 93 is a poignant film, one which no one will emerge from without having felt what it must have felt like to be on-board the ill-fated flight on the morning of September 11th. The last few moments of the film were so intense that I had to remind myself to keep breathing.",10,0,2,22 September 2006
