","I can't get over it. I loved this movie. It's an hour long, but I was terrified. The ending was the greatest. It was a perfect example of how the genre should work. The only offsetting thing was the language. I've heard much worse, but it bothered me. But don't let that stop you.",Null,0,0,8 August 1999

","No words can describe how great this movie is. It's for the people who liked Al Pacino in the Godfather. Multiply his performance by 20 and you get Tony Montana. Fans of Schwarzenneger will like his quotes, and Tarrantino fans will like the characters. Get past the awful language and sometimes disturbing violence and a good movie lies therin.",10,0,0,24 June 1999
