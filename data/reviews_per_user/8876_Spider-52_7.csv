Casablanca," Only 'Casablanca' can give you that feeling.
","'Casablanca' is one of those films that just seems to get better and better every time you see it.  Watching it for the second time, I was able to sort of step back and take in the fine details.  The city after which the film is named has got to be the most memorable movie locale of all time.  From Rick's lively bar, to the ominous lighthouse looming in the darkness, to the foggy runway of the airport, the city of Casablanca has more character than many other films have in their characters.As cynical bar owner Rick Blaine, Humphrey Bogart gives arguably his most distinguished performance.  Bogart has the pleasure of delivering some of cinema's most famous lines, and we have the pleasure of receiving them. Ingrid Bergman holds her own against Bogart, although her Ilsa is more subtle.'Casablanca' is not the greatest film ever made.  However, a very strong argument can be made that it is one of the most entertaining.  'Casablanca' is not about flashy directing, powerful acting, or an unpredictable story. It is about its unforgettable characters and dialog, richly detailed locale, and that great feeling you get that cannot be described, and that only 'Casablanca' can create.",10,0,0,15 August 1999
Shakespeare in Love," Good, but definitely not great.
","After finally watching 'Shakespeare in Love', I find myself not understanding what all the fuss was about. Sure, the costuming is excellent and the acting is very good across the board, but there really isn't anything here to elevate it above the status of an enjoyable romantic comedy.What really stops 'Shakespeare in Love' from being a great film is the lack of a real climax.  The movie seems to be content with having a performance of Romeo and Juliet be its climax.  While it is an excellent stage production, it really doesn't provide any of the tension or emotion that is essential in this scene that the film has been building up to.  In fact, I found the entire movie to be lacking in this department; it doesn't involve the audience enough in what is happening.It is because of this fact that one should not watch 'Shakespeare in Love' with the intention of finding anything out of the ordinary.  When it comes right down to it, 'Shakespeare in Love' is certainly not a great film, and most definitely not the best one of 1998.  It is, however, an entertaining and enjoyable romantic comedy that you won't want to pass up seeing.",8,2,4,23 August 1999
Dark City," Pure entertainment.
","'Dark City' is an astonishing mix of Science Fiction and Film Noir, and the result is one of very best films of the 1990s, if not of all time.This is one of the most original films in years.  The plot behind 'Dark City' is one of the best in my recent memory, and is guaranteed to keep you glued to your seat right until the closing credits.  The film's real genius, however, comes in its special effects and the world that it creates for us. 'Dark City' is virtually unrivalled in its adeptness at creating an atmosphere that draws in the viewer; in fact, the only film I can think of off-hand that surpasses it in this department is 'Casablanca'.  Everything in the film is intricately designed--the city itself is an achievement of monumental proportions.  'Dark City' provides the greatest special effects to date, and I was completely drawn in by the sheer detail of the film.The best part of all is that it is one of the most entertaining films I have ever seen.  'Dark City' is exhilarating from start to finish, and the ending sequence is simply astounding in both pace and design.'Dark City' is a film unlike any other before it.  'Dark City' is movie-making at its very finest:  this is pure entertainment.",10,0,1,25 August 1999
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Without exception, the finest motion picture ever made.
","What can I say that hasn't already been said?  Jack Nicholson's performance is a searing tour de force that I consider to be the finest movie performance of all time.  Every supporting role is superb, most notably Louise Fletcher and a small but solid performance from Brad Dourif.Milos Forman's direction has a sort of gritty, documentary-style texture to it that gives the film just that little extra effectiveness.  The writing and dialog are perhaps the greatest in any film, with Nicholson delivering the film's most memorable lines (and there are many).  Every single scene is incredible in its own right, from McMurphy's re-enactment of the World Series to a joy ride on a fishing boat.  The final 30 minutes or so are absolutely staggering in their emotional intensity.If you have not yet seen this film, stop reading now and literally run to your local video store to rent it.  It is the most powerful, emotional, and involving movie ever put on film. See it, for it is without exception the finest motion picture ever made.",10,1,3,12 August 1999
Speed," An excellent action film in which the pace never lets up.
","'Speed' is pure action.  The film relies more on thinking of obstacles for its protagonists than on a real story, but in this case it actually works. The characters are interesting (Dennis Hopper is terrific as usual), the stunts are spectacular, and the action just keeps coming and coming. Along with 'Die Hard' and 'True Lies', 'Speed' delivers one of the fastest 2+ hours of any film in recent memory.Fans of action films will definitely not want to miss this one.",8,0,1,1 September 1999
The Sixth Sense," Creepy, entertaining, but takes too much credit.
","*Warning:  My comments may contain spoilers for those who haven't seen 'The Sixth Sense' yet.If there has ever been a movie more derivative of another movie (re-makes aside) than 'The Sixth Sense' is of 'Jacob's Ladder' I don't know what it is.  I figured out the 'surprise' ending approximately five minutes into the movie, as will anyone who has seen Adrian Lyne's film.  Once you know what is coming, the ending seems somewhat hastily tacked on.  This is not to say that the film is without entertainment; quite the contrary, actually.By far the best thing about the film is Haley Joel Osment.  This kid is an excellent actor, and I hope he continues to find work for himself.  He seems to be very natural, and when I got into the movie, I didn't notice that he was acting at all.I also loved the atmosphere of 'The Sixth Sense'.  It has some genuinely creepy moments with a few good jumps thrown in for good measure.  Every shot seems dark and brooding, perfectly matching the film's content.I have one major gripe, however.  Maybe I'm strange, but I find it difficult to swallow when a brilliant but unsuccessful and virtually unknown film has its formula copied and 'Hollywoodized' into a new movie that is enormously successful, but not even close to being as good. 'The Matrix' did it to the incredible sci-fi noir 'Dark City', and now 'The Sixth Sense' is doing it to the vastly superior 'Jacob's Ladder', and to an even greater extent.  If you want to watch a horror film--and you simply *must* see a movie in the theatre--I would recommend 'The Sixth Sense', as it is fine entertainment. Otherwise, head down to your local video store and rent the psychological horror masterpiece that is 'Jacob's Ladder'.",7,0,0,18 August 1999
Gladiator," I Weep For American Cinema
","Everything there is to be said about this movie has already been said, so I will keep my comments brief.  'Gladiator''s musical score is breathtaking; the rest of the movie, in all other facets, is garbage.  If you generally like what the majority of the American population likes, you will enjoy this movie.  If you usually prefer films with competent direction (including action scenes where you might actually *GASP* be able to see the action), intelligent dialogue (it took three people to write this?!), professional acting (brilliant death scene Russell...you really deserved that Oscar), or special effects that seem even remotely realistic, you may wish to look elsewhere.  The latest in a long string of inane Best Picture choices, this is by far the worst in the history of the Academy Awards.The only consolation for myself and those who share my opinion is that in twenty years, 'Gladiator' will come to rest in the same category as 'Rocky' and 'Kramer vs Kramer'--not that there were any 'Taxi Driver's or 'Apocalypse Now's released in 2000.  If this is a sign of things to come, the future of cinema in the United States will be very grim indeed.",3,0,2,27 March 2001
