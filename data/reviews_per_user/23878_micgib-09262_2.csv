Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Another masterpiece
","Warning: There may be spoilers Once again Tarantino excels. This film is more dialogue driven than it's predecessor, however is just as enjoyable. Once again the highlight is Uma Truman's lead performance. In fact this film probably displays Thurman's talent as an actress more prominently than ever before. However like it's predecessor this film also features excellent supporting work. David Carradine in particular give an outstanding performance in his villainous role. Daryl Hannah and Michael Madsen are also excellent in this Martial Arts flick. Overall Vol 2 is just as enjoyable as Vol 1 and will satisfy a large range of viewers.",10,2,3,14 October 2017
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Best feminist action film ever!!!!!
","This film is an the result of a genius mind. Quentin Tarantion is one of the greatest film makers in the world today. He has produces outstanding film after outstanding film. And Kill Bill Vol 1 is no exception. Tarantino choreographed the fight scenes in this film and when an expert fight choreographer was hired to assist Tarantino, he saw the fight sequences said his assistance was not required. The dialogue is fantastic as with any Tarantino film. He is a genius with words. While e not his best screenplay, it's very much enjoyable. The best thing about this film however is Uma Thurman's lead performance. In perhaps her finest moment Thurman steals every scene she's in. She adds depth to this already complex character. However, the supporting acting in this film is also outstanding with Lucy Liu at her best and Vivica A Fox giving an electrifying performance Overall a fantastic film",10,4,7,14 October 2017
