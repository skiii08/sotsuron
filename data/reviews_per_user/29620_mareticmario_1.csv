Sucker Punch," A visual orgasm with a profound message...
","What to say about this movie? Sure as hell ain't what I expected... but at the same time fulfilled my wildest expectations. I don't know how many of you have noticed, but there is now a plethora of movies that challenge our beliefs of what we think is real. Movie directors have caught on to something and they're guiding us, in their own way, so we come to the same realizations.Most of the people that didn't understand this movie never had any consciousness expanding experiences.The movie starts with a eerie atmosphere of reality in which Babydoll's mother dies and her troubles start. She is soon brought to a facility for insane people, and after a quick, but crucial, few scenes the movie sets on a different tone. The girl finds herself in a shared illusion where the girls envision themselves in a brothel. The director emphasizes their view of the world whilst on medication. As the plot thickens Babydoll is transported into a world of her imagination whilst she musters her inner strength to do the seemingly impossible, hence the orgasmic action scenes from our wildest fantasies. A character named Wise Man follows them there and throws seemingly non-story related sayings that are supposed to inspire.Pretty simple plot, right?Not really. None of the characters are what they're supposed to be. The way to watch the movie properly is so that you realize that all the characters are archetypes of the human psyche. Babydoll is the innocence suffering in the unjust world, Blue is the personification of the ego run amok, the Wise Man is the voice of guidance within us all, and Sweet Pea is OUR freedom, tricked away from under our own noses, but inevitable in the end. All of the characters can be related to the inner workings of your own mind. Thats what the ancient people did with their myths, as now our own people are creating archetypes so you can understand the situation we all find ourselves in.We find ourselves in a world that is run by criminals, dominated by ego, and where innocence finds only pain. Snyder is saying to all of us, not just in this movie, but in all of his movies, that we can summon our inner strenght and use it to beat insurmountable odds... and there is guidance. Just look within yourself. You will find all the strength that you need. You have all the weapons you need.Now FIGHT!!",10,3,6,26 August 2011
