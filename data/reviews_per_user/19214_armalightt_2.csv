United 93," A moving tribute to the Heroes of Flight 93
","I've just rented and watched 'United 93'. I'll be buying a copy on DVD. In my will it shall be stipulated a copy of the film be left to each of my very young grandchildren.Now that the NORAD tapes have been made public we can understand more completely how carefully the film makers worked to preserve the essential truth of the story of United Airlines Flight 93. This film is harrowing but ultimately, I believe, will stand the test of time. I am deeply humbled after having watched it. I am a 59 year old retired history teacher. I have traveled the world. Over the past 5 years I have looked into every aspect of what happened on 9/11/01. I was not satisfied with the official explanation. Though ultimately I have found the 'inside job' point of view contributed nothing to the truth. Unless of course one were a frustrated marxian revolutionary or radical Islamic misogynist and the truth had to be subordinated to a dogma.After all the America Haters are dead and gone, indeed after all of us are long gone, 'United 93' will stand as a testament to the everyday Americans who stood as one and joined forever the glorious dead at Bunker Hill, Gettysburg, Belleau Wood, Iwo Jima, and Normandy, among other ground made sacred by those who died so we could be free. And yes, we are free here. So have at it.",10,4,7,7 September 2006
The Da Vinci Code," One fans review
","To be this long a film must have some genuine suspense; or at least the eye must be transported to another realm. Sadly this film has little suspense, and even less eye candy. To tell the truth I found the writing in the book pretty sloppy, I finished it only because the story itself moved along. It had that much going for it. The film doesn't. It just drags.I don't know what happened to Ron Howard, perhaps he confused book reading time with screen watching time. Maybe it was a case of take the money and run. I don't know.If you absolutely loved the book you might like the film. If the book failed to move you, the film will leave you high and dry as well.",1,25,52,18 May 2006
