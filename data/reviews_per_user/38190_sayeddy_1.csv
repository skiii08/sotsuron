Iron Man 3," Biggest disappointment this year...
","I found Iron man 3 the worst one... the suit kept braking all the time, the whole movie had like a million and 1 plot holes ... the more i think about the plot of the movie in detail the more plot holes I find and the more annoyed and angered I get especially at the fact that most of this could of been avoided had they not made a joke of the main mandarin villain...the trailer was also false advertising because it lie's to viewer showing a much more serious and darker film with all powerful and extremely intellectual and smart bad guy that for once has his own army yet not real...which was the main intrigue from the trailer andï»¿ in my opinion the main reason why a lot of people will go to watch the movie... the jokes were no where as funny as in iron man 1 or two... tony stark was a cocky funny millionaire playboy philanthropist yet sounded like an everyday person compared to the previous movies and especially the avengers where i believe his jokes and his lines were the most funny ...and the whole film felt rushed or extremely badly edited as all characters were all over the place ...one minute a character is in one place and before you realize their already somewhere else with their own mood with little explanation as the pace of the movie is extremely quick in a bad way...iron man 3 is hard to follow and I found myself bored halfway as I came to watch iron man and only got him for 20 minutes of the film as he barely wears the suit apart from towards the end which was the best part of the movie... plus his suit kept braking and fair enough hit was a prototype but he had more than 40 suits that were not prototypes and were ready why could he have just used the suits that were functional and ready instead ? why did he not call all of his 40 suit army when the supposed mandarin was destroying his house and yet called all the suits at the end?? how could iron man/ tony start so easily remove the arc reactor from his chest and the shrapnel from his heart if in iron man 2 he was dieing from the radiation it gave to his body and he had to invent his own element to fix it? why couldn't he have removed the arc reactor then when it was killing him in iron man 2 if it was so easy? they don't explain...also the main powers of the bad guys were barely explained all we knew was there was this 'extremis' virus that made regrow limbs, breath fire and burn and explode if becoming out of control... what also doesn't make sense is how iron man could have been hit by Thor in the avengers using lightning and barely nothing happen to his suit yet here there people who have burning powers and could melt his suits by just touching them ? sorry but which is worse ? lightning or fire ? alsoThor hits iron man's suit with his godly hammer 'mjolnir' so hard that it sends him off in the other direction only to see iron man fly back and hit Thor without any problem,s yet his suit in iron man 3 brakes to pieces when hit by a normal car in iron man 3?? that makes no sense...how could marvel have accepted this script... the first movie of marvel studios with such a rushed and filled with plot holes script with so many places making zero sense what so ever...I give it a 6 out of 10 due to the great effects but the plot was bullshit... and believe me... this is coming from a person who is a big big fan of the marvel cinematic universe and who's favorite her out of hawk eye, black widow, iron man, captain America, hulk and Thor IS actually IRON MAN and has been waiting in patiently for this movie since it was announced only to be extremely let down...i think 'shane black' ruined this movie and they should get 'jon' 'favreau' back or get 'joss' 'whedon' to take care of iron man franchise instead as it IS their most popular and financially successful hero by FAR...",5,7,14,3 May 2013
