The Blair Witch Project," unrealistic, but fun for a while
","This movie kept me scared for a while, then as it got gorier and the plot needed to be resolved it became silly and unrealistic.  All told, I am glad to see a movie like this do well at the box office because the low-tech element to it was a welcome change from the tendency toward glitzy effects and explosions.",6,1,3,20 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Great effects, disappointing script
","I thought that the special effects for this movie were beyond anything I have ever seen.  The rendering of the various vehicles and creatures was fantastic.  The action was also quite compelling.  Unfortunately, the comic relief provided by some of the silly dialogue fell flat.  I'm not sure if rasta aliens really exist, but I would hope they might be a little less slapsticky than Ja-Ja Biggs.It also seemed like Lucas had difficulty defining his wishes for the young Anikin Skywalker.  At times he is presented as a source of wisdom and power and at other times he is a goofy kid who says things like, 'you mean I get to ride in your spaceship with you?'Worth a look, but somehow the original movies carried their cheesy material off a little better.",5,0,1,19 May 1999
Gladiator," I laughed throughout
","This movie is unadulterated junk posing as historical spectacle.  The cinematography is choppy, making it impossible to really follow any of the action sequences.  I think people have been deceived after years of Tarantino worship into thinking that choppy editing makes a movie more intense or edgy or somesuch nonsense.  Unfortunately, the problems with this movie extend to Crowe's monotonous acting, the distracting, boring subplots (mostly driven by secretive glances), and the historical inaccuracies.Sorry, but America (and the academy, I'm afraid) was duped by this piece of expensive trash.",1,7,19,11 April 2001
Princess Mononoke," Very slow in parts
","Like all anime, the motivations of certain central characters were unclear at times.  In addition, the dialogue fell flat, especially during moments when there was no action to support it.  I wanted to like this movie, but could not fully lose myself in the fantasy because of the above-mentioned flaws.",5,1,12,27 November 2000
