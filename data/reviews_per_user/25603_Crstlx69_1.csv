The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," As a twilight fan I love it!
","I say love because I really want to see it again and again. I felt like Jacob and Edwards acting was awesome. I was moved to tears a few times. Aside the fact that the wolves talking to each other sounded like something out of power rangers, it was amazing. The way Jacobs imprinting was portrayed, the Birth scene, how the memories of all of the other movies and even Bella's child hood was showed, how they included songs from the first movie for example how they danced together at their wedding and the song that played when they were at the prom dancing together for the first time. Jacob breaking down when Bella was dead drew a tear to my eye that actually rolled down my cheek. And the fight between the Cullen's and the wolves was crazy! Any twilight fan would know exactly what this movie would be like. I was expecting a slow start with a long honeymoon. I wasn't expecting the male leads to carry Kristen Stewart, who isn't that great an actress in my opinion, so effortlessly through the movie. It's been awhile since I read breaking dawn so I forgot about the drama between the wolves and vampires. But I enjoyed breaking dawn for jogging my memory. I agree that they should have made the whole book one movie. I don't want to wait another year to see the last movie! By the way HARRY POTTER IS ITS OWN MOVIE. I am a Fan of the Harry potter movies also. You just can't compare the 2! I'm tired of people acting like they are all the same. Twilight is about vampires Harry potter is about wizards. Get over it!",9,4,11,26 November 2011
