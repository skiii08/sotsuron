Minority Report," Anderton versus the Future
","Year 2054. Washington. John Anderton is a policeman who discovers the most terrible truth he can imagine. He, guardian of life and public order, is accused of killing somebody he doesn't know. This is the initial plot of the futuristic movie Minority Report, by Steven Spielberg. The film combines quite well the adventures of John Anderton with a more interesting undertone. It tells us about important questions like freedom, civil rights and the possible guilt of people who have committed no crime. Minority Report is based on a essential idea: in the future a police group with capacity to know crimes before they happen will exist. And guilty people will be accused before committing a punishable action. Spielberg criticizes and studies in depth our western society - The terrors, fears and vengeful feelings. He shows us the most immoral part of that vigilance system and proposes a discussion about security and civil rights. The movie is developed from one premise: A pre-crime system works very well. But it really only works in 90% of the cases. For that reason, a discussion is created because it allows errors against innocent people. actually, this is an argument very common now and more important after the birth of the new psychosis of panic due to global terrorism. On the other hand, another theme is publicity and the invasion of our private lives. In the movie, advertising posters read people's irises and they can talk to that consumer particularly. This film attacks this consumer world. Minority Report has also got a good dose of action and adventures which star the brilliant Tom Cruise. The persecution with propellants or the main character's escape with a `pre-cog' are two lessons for every film fan.",Null,0,0,18 November 2002
