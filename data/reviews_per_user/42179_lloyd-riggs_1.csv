Requiem for a Dream," Propo-Ganda
","One of the best propaganda films post 1950's. The entire film, while depressing as far as drug addicts go, is not all very realistic, but surely makes one hate drugs. While many people come into positions in life such as the main woman, it is not quit full of as much servitude as one would expect, especially in the wake of some sort of payment, which endorses our capitalist system well. The belief that drug addicts can not exist in a society, especially one where they are not hurting or being hurt, exist no where else on earth than the US. Even Mexico and poor countries have abandoned this view. As such, this film full-fills the desires, political agendas and wishes of the US government, in labeling drugs and drug addicts in such a way as to de-humanize them, effectively giving everyone a sense of media based representation of realities, and not real people. It does raise some interesting issues, but most people find themselves shocked rather than woken up to some alternative realities existing in their own society.",10,0,1,6 October 2009
