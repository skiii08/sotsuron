Miracle," really good
","first of all, i would just like to say that i LOVE hockey, and i really thought this movie was good.  when you were watching the game, you felt like cheering every time they scored and booing when the other team did. i really enjoyed it. the plot was very interesting as well. i didnt really know the whole story of the win over the soviets until i saw this movie.  the actors were also really good. kurt russel is a very good actor. i think its a great movie for anyone who likes hockey or just likes a good story. it was fun to see this movie in the theatre because i felt like i was actually at the hockey game. i dont know if the actors were actually the ones playing hockey, but if they werent in the movie it sure looked like they were.",9,0,0,19 March 2004
Gone Baby Gone," The Perfect Film
","I don't often comment on movies, but this movie hit me so hard that I feel I have to let others know how amazing it is. I went into this movie expecting your basic thriller kidnapping film, with maybe a twist at some point. What I got was so much more than that.This film leaves you questioning morality and what constitutes the 'right decision.' A line from the film is 'shame is God's way of saying you did something bad' or something along those lines. I feel that this film encompasses that quote. It questions the difference between the law and what is best for a person. I really feel that this film made me reexamine my morals and how I would react if I were placed in the position that the antagonist in the film is.The acting was absolutely superb. Casey Affleck really surprised me with his performance, even though I have recently seen Assassination of Jesse James and know that he has real talent. He showed amazing complexity with his character and there was a depth there that I have never seen from him before.Overall, I would whole-heartedly recommend this film for anyone who enjoys a deep, thought-provoking experience.",10,0,1,18 February 2008
