Resident Evil: Afterlife," OK i got my zombies, got my action, but wheres my explanation!?
","Ill start by stating i am a resident evil fan, but not of the movies, of the games, and having played the fifth game i know what is going on (sort of) but what about the people who have only watched the movies. I took my girlfriend along to see this and she was confused as all hell when we came out. At one point i remember her asking 'whats with the giant dude with the axe?' and it made me think, why haven't the directors/screenwriters explained ANYTHING? people who haven't played the games don't know where the hell the majini came from, or even what they are called, only that they are 'zombies' with tentacles coming out of their mouths. and no one else seems to get why wesker is the way he is unless you've played the games. on another point, i don't know where the hell the majini came from in this film, they are just there!! OK more ramblings, this time from a lover of film and not the games. The plot is terrible, there is no explanation (as i have already stated) and the acting was absolutely atrocious. the only person who carried their character properly was Ali larter playing claire. also, the casting for the new characters was terrible as well. Wentworth Miller playing chris redfield?????? what were they thinking, also Shawn Roberts who played wesker carried the character terribly, he well overdid it.OK the good points, the flashiness worked, sort of, but i did have to turn a blind eye to EVERYTHING else but the stylised violence and the endless references to the fifth games enemies (which made no sense in terms of the plot of the movie but it was cool as a fan to see majini and the executioner in the film) and the fight between wesker, chris, and claire was kinda cool (if you overlook the fact that they have used the exact same choreography as one particular fight scene in the fifth game) and these are the reasons i have given it a much as a 5. purely cause it looked kinda cool",5,0,1,12 November 2010
