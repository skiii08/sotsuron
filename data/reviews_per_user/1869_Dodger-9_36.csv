Vertigo," All time high for Hitch
","An ex-detective with a fear of heights is hired to follow the wife of an old friend who fears she may try to commit suicide. Sounds simple enough on paper but this is one of the most intriguing of Alfred Hitchcock's movies, not least because of our leading man's obsession.James Stewart gives perhaps his most intense performance and Kim Novak is very good as the obligatory icy blonde. The moment when a ghostly Novak emerges from the bathroom is one of the most haunting in screen history. An influential film for many of today's top directors, it inspired Basic Instinct, Batman and The Crying Game, not to mention 12 Monkeys which featured a clip in the movie itself.",9,2,4,20 January 2001
Fight Club," The best movie of 99
","'Contains Spoilers' What can you say about a movie which has become one of the most notorious of the last few years?Well, it's shocking, funny, dynamic, unforgettable, queasy and original. As with Trainspotting three years ago, David Fincher's latest film burrows deep into your subconscious and stays there.Long after most of the year's releases are collecting dust on the video shelves of the world, Fight Club will still be there, lying dormant in your brain, just waiting for someone to trigger off the collective memory of this grimy, hyper-stunning tale.Edward Norton is Jack, the narrator who, as the story opens, is an insomniac suffering from life in the late 20th century. He exists to collect more must have items from the IKEA catalogue and achieve a nirvana-like completeness.In an attempt to find some sort of feeling in his vaccuum of a life, he starts attending support groups for men with testicular cancer, tuberculosis and the like. Finding comfort in the 'bitch tits' of Robert Paulson (Meat Loaf), our hero cries his heart out and realises he is still alive after all.Until Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) arrives that is.Like our narrator, Marla is a tourist. A strung-out harpy of a woman who seeks some meaning to her own meaningless existence.Jack cannot feel happiness while he is aware that there is another imposter in the room so they reach a deal and a bizarre relationship constructed of mutual respect for one another's bizarre interest.When Jack meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) on a flight, his life is turned upside down by the soap salesman with a bizarre dress sense.The besuited hero goes back to his apartment to find the place has been gutted by a gas explosion and so in a fit of desperation, Jack rings Durden.They meet up at a local bar, have a few beers and eventually our numb yuppie gets to stay with Tyler.Before long the two men are living together in one of the most decrepit houses ever seen in a major motion picture. This makes The Bradbury in Blade Runner look like Mimi Rogers' apartment in Someone To Watch Over Me.One night they start clashing in a bar forecourt - no malice in these fisticuffs though. Just the affirmation that both men are alive in a world where consumerism has taken precedence over feeling.The scuffle leads to the eponymous organisation, an underground arena for businessmen, blue collar workers and the like to beat the crap out of each other and feel good about it.Jack starts turning up at work with bruises and the sort of manner that marks him out as a man to be avoided. He starts dressing down, bleeding onto his collar and sporting gashes that make his colleagues back away in fear.And so it goes. Fight Club spreads...The first hour of the movie leads you down one straight, dimly lit path, brilliantly executed with living catalogues creating themselves from thin air, close-ups of gas cookers releasing their invisible cargo to a doom-laden room and just the sort of eye-catching visuals that has made Fincher one of the best directors of his generation.What did it mean to me? Well, like one of the disillusioned masses that seeks solace in the comfort of pre-packaged food, franchise furniture stores and mind numbing TV, this is an epiphany of a film. A jet black comedy that left me feeling sick and in a state of altered consciousness - if you're driving home from the movies afterwards, you may need time to collect your thoughts as this is not one of the movies where you just go and get a burger afterwards, having forgotten the plot by the time you get to the counter.Ironically, Fincher's visuals will be lifted by the very companies he is taking the mickey out of over the next few years and this thorn in the side of the moral majority will achieve cult status on video - after all, everyone will want to freeze frame the subliminal moments when both Tyler and Marla appear.However, if you get the chance, catch this on the big screen with a decent sound system and an open mind.Although the actual bone-splintering fight scenes will leave you felling sick, this is not a movie about fighting. It's a film in which the disillusioned masses, born in a generation of TV and video games without soul, try to make sense of a plastic culture.Even if it means losing their minds in order to do so.",10,2,6,15 December 1999
Underworld," Tiresome
","It's a long time since i've been so bored watching a movie. KateBeckinsale is miscast as a surly vampire warrior who clashes witha race of werewolves. There's no humour in the movie, thesupporting cast are hugely bland and unlikeable while the specialeffects are often cheesy and dull. The fact that it was released onsuch a huge scale in the US and Britain proves that the powersthat be were keen on making a fast buck before bad word of mouthwas passed around. If you can imagine Aliens, Blade, The Matrixand The Crow merged together and then all of the charm suckedout, then this is the result. Bargepoles required.",Null,0,0,22 September 2003
12 Monkeys," Show me the mon-key
","Terry Gilliam has made many fine films over the years. For my money. he's one of the best directors in the world - a film-maker who has been cursed by some bad luck since he made his directorial debut with Monty Python and The Holy Grail in 1975.Made for a few thousand quid, he and co-director Terry Jones proved they could make an hilarious comedy which looked like it cost ten times the budget. Gilliam broke off to make Jabberwocky in 1977 and although not a huge commercial or critical success, it does boast some inventive visuals. By 1981, he delivered a trilogy of movies which would span the dizzy heights of blockbuster (Time Bandits), the unchartered waters of a film-maker taking on Hollywood and winning (Brazil) and the glorious flop that was The Adventures of Baron Munchausen.The hedonistic excesses of the Eighties were naturally followed by a worldwide recession and the feeling of redemption for over spending was never more apparent than in Hollywood.If one side of the coin was the absurdly expensive Munchausen, then Gilliam sought to make amends with The Fisher King.That 1991 classic saw Gilliam back on blockbusting form as had been the case 10 years earlier. Surely his next big hit was just around the corner.Er, not quite.It was five years until Gilliam followed it up with one of the best films of 1996.Twelve Monkeys is a bleak, stunning take on Chris Marker's 1962 photo roman film, La Jetee. What's a photo roman? Basically a series of still photos presented in film form. David Peoples, one of the brains behind Blade Runner and Unforgiven had used that as a springboard for his screenplay co-written with wife Janet.They developed a script about a convict from the future living in an underground society. Hired by a bunch of scientists to go back in time and discover the source of the virus which wiped out much of mankind, through some cock up in their calculations, he bounces around time periods like a silver ball bouncing off the bumpers of a pinball machine.So basically it's a dirtier version of Back to the Future, but what makes this far more impressive is its mind bending script and three knockout performances from its cast.Brad Pitt is superb as the manic rich man's son who takes doomed time traveller Cole (Bruce Willis) under his wing. The darkly glamorous Madeleine Stowe adds just the right degree of intelligent sexiness to make this a must for the film goer who likes their leading lady with brains and beauty.The movie was made for a fraction of most films in 1996 but thanks to Gilliam's bizarre sense of aesthetics and some superb support from the likes of Jeffrey Beercroft, it looks like it cost a lot more than it did..",Null,0,0,8 December 2001
Shaun of the Dead," One of the best British romantic zombie comedies ever made
","As a lover of sublime sitcom Spaced, like millions of fans waiting for Shaun of the Dead, i never imagined writer and star Simon Pegg and director Edgar Wright could repeat their magic for the big screen. Thankfully i was wrong. SOTD is one of the freshest, most enjoyable British films i've ever seen and boasts more inventive one liners and set pieces staged for a low budget British movie. Pegg is on fine form as the hopeless electrical store salesman who finds his authority threatened by a surly teenage co-worker, his love life is on the rocks and he doesn't get on with his step dad. His housemate is a loveably offensive drug dealer who spends all day lounging around the house playing computer games, while Shaun's entire social life seems to consist of going to the pub. When zombies appear in London, Shaun rises to the occasion and leads his band of friends and relatives in a full on battle again the living dead. Familiar faces from Spaced, the excellent Nick Frost, Peter Serafinowicz, Julia Deakin (in a brief cameo) and some from Black Books (also a Nira Park production) Dylan Moran and Tamsin Greig, make this a delight while Lucy Davis and Martin Freeman from the office also appear. Bill Nighy has a short but memorable appearance as Pegg's screen stepfather Phillip and while the first half of the film is hilarious, the second half turns into a genuine horror film as Shaun and friends tackle an army of excellent zombies. An instant cult classic which some will find disturbing. However, despite the modest budget, Wright and Pegg have done a fantastic job of delivering one of the best films of the year, and indeed the decade. The fact that i couldn't wait for it to finish so i could watch it all again is testament to its quality. More soon please. 10/10",10,1,3,12 April 2004
The English Patient," David Lean with laughs
","Winner of nine Oscars and a shelf full of other awards, The English Patient is an epic in every sense of the word.                              Three years before making The Talented Mr Ripley, Anthony Minghella delivered a mesmerising drama of huge proportions for a mere $20million. It may lose a lot on the small screen but the script still packs something of a wallop and will leave many blubbing into their cushions. A great cast - Ralph Fiennes, Kristin Scott Thomas and Willem Dafoe among them - provide more first class performances than you can shake a stick at and elegantly flesh out the tale of a hideously scarred central character, waiting for death.                               The eclectic characters that come into contact with him are also nursing their own hurts and, thanks to an erratic narrative that flits between pre and post-World War Two, this tale unfolds so well, you may wish it would never end.                               Fiennes delivers a measured performance as the eponymous, enigmatic character, Laszlo de Almasy; Scott Thomas is coolly elegant as his glacial lover, Katharine Clifton; while Juliette Binoche and Dafoe have rarely been better in their supporting roles.
                              There are many memorable images, such as the opening painting of a stick figure superimposed over the shifting dunes of the desert, the Daffodil yellow biplane soaring over the mountains and Fiennes' scarred character carried through the rain at the end of the war.                               An intelligent adult film which never takes itself as seriously as the David Lean movies of yesteryear.
                              The scene where a character walks away during a movie screening is pure Brief Encounter - until they crack their head on scaffolding. It's touches such as this which make The English Patient all the more delicious a movie.                              Although a bit of a bum-number, it definitely warrants the near-three hour running time.                              It was a tough movie to get made given, as director Minghella says, that its star was burned beyond recognition in a bed, remembering things about Europe and the War, and it was to be directed by a film-maker who had never done anything on this scale before. But the cast was committed and, when the project appeared to have fallen through, never gave up.                               Ralph Fiennes says: 'I did have complete faith that it would sort itself out. The script was so extraordinary and brilliant that I couldn't accept that it wouldn't be made at some point.'                               Fiennes fell in love with the desert when they were filming in Tunisia. He found the hotel where they stayed, at an oasis in the south, dispiriting, but the desert itself was 'hypnotic, wonderful and very moving. It is sort of ironic that it becomes a set. It is bigger than a set and you come in and stake your claim and you are framing bits of a desert which is so enormous and infinite and an extraordinary place.' One of the problems with the production, aside from raising the budget, was shooting in the sand.                              Every retake meant moving to a new location or resculpting the sand to make it look untouched by the size 10s of an international film crew. Minghella compared his problems to those of the late great David Lean whose epic, Lawrence of Arabia, this most resembles.                              'Lean would shoot and then go 40 kilometres to find an untouched spot,' he remarked during production. 'It's no wonder he was found wandering in the desert.'                              Minghella cut his teeth on Inspector Morse and it's rather nice to see none other than Kevin Whateley among the supporting cast. Listen closely and you may even hear John Thaw's cries of 'Lewis!' drifting across the dunes.",Null,24,43,4 November 2000
Billy Elliot," Brassed Off 2
","As with Mark Herman's 1996 drama, Brassed Off, this is another tale of hope set against the backdrop of the 1984 miner's strike. The eponymous hero is an 11-year-old whose dad and brother are on strike, his gran is losing his marbles and Billy misses his dear departed mum.While doing a spot of boxing training, Billy becomes entranced by a band of wannabe ballet starlets and is taken under the wing of Julie Walters, on Bafta-winning form yet again.Okay, she hasn't even been nominated for a gong yet but watch out for the brilliant Brummie next Spring as the winners are announced.This is a touching tale which may not be the most original story in the world, but boasts great performances from all concerned. Aside from Walters and Patrick Malahide as a snobby London-based ballet VIP, the rest of the cast are unknowns who are bound to go onto bigger things after this.A great movie which will leave grown men choking back the tears as the young hero makes his inevitable shot at the big time.9/10",Null,0,0,4 October 2000
Snatch," Violent but fun
","Guy Ritchie is the movie world's equivalent of Blur's Damon Albarn, a rich kid pretending to be a Cockerney geezer. If you can get past the fact that Guy's obsession with gangsters involves a series of Minder-like creations, each with their own charming, often enigmatic moniker, then Snatch is a lot of fun.As with Lock Stock, this is a complex tale of a heist gone wrong, a psychopathic crimelord (the terrifying Alan Ford, looking like Mike Myers as the dad in So, I Married an Axe Murderer), a couple of wide boys, and Brad Pitt as the incoheent Irish bare knuckle boxer, Mickey. There's about a dozen secondary characters, but let's leave them alone.There are some fine moments in this densely plotted caper, although Dennis Farina looks like he's wandered in from another movie as Avi, the obligatory American used to sell the movie to the US market. The other is Stateside thesp is Benicio Del Toro, a lot leaner after Leaving Las Vegas and far more coherent than in The Usual Suspects.The soundtrack is great, the editing snappy and intriguing while Ritchie's dialogue ranged from the hilarious to the downright amateurish.Vinnie Jones proves that he's no mere flash in the pan as Bullet tooth Tony, a far more rounded character than Sphinx in Gone in 60 Seconds. Oddly enough, he also gets a chance to cut a dog open in the hope of retrieving a vital plot device.Yes, Snatch really is that subtle.However, it's also a lot more likeable than GISS, with far more interesting characters and made for a lot less money.And there's a chance to see Mike Reid giving a knockout performance as a faux Jewish diamond merchant. Why this man isn't employed more often on the big screen defies belief.",8,0,0,3 September 2000
The Beach," Paradise lost
","Calm yourselves girls. Despite the presence of Titanic's Leo DiCaprio, The Beach is not other tale of doomed romance while computer generated actors wander around an ill-fated liner.Instead, it's a fascinating if somewhat flawed adaptation of the cult Alex Garland novel.Leo is Richard (a Brit in the book but an American here which seems to make sound commercial sense). He's a traveller who takes off for Thailand in search of something a little extra, the sort of experience you don't find on package holidays.What he does find is a raving Scotsman called Daffy who tells him of a secluded island paradise with perfect waters and gorgeous sand. The next morning he is found dead having slashed his wrists. But Daffy's demise has not gone without purpose in this heady, intoxicating tale. Before he topped himself, the raving Scot left a map of how to get to the eponymous paradise on Leo's door.So before you can say Wish you were here, Leo and a couple of neighbouring lovers (Virginie Ledoyen and Guillaume Canet) have taken off on a 500 mile journey in search of paradise.Naturally they find the beach and after overcoming many obstacles such as surviving a death defying swim to the island, a perilous jump into a lagoon and a field full of cliched dope farmers with rifles, our trio of gorgeous young things happens across the idyllic utopia run by Sal (Tilda Swinton).She runs this community with a mixture of admirable precision and head girl bossiness. The deal is that those who live there have a taste of paradise and can play cricket, swim in the crystal waters and enjoy all that it has to offer as long as they don't tell anyone about the location.Alas, poor old Dicky decided to leave a copy of the map with a bunch of dope head travellers who naturally decide to see for themselves.Inevitably, they are gunned down by the hackneyed dope farmers and it soon becomes apparent that this paradise is guarded with an iron fist.It's during the third act that John Hodge's screenplay goes off the rails and although it was inevitable that paradise would turn out to be a rather sour experience, the means with which Richard descends into an Apocalypse Now like madness and then finds things resolved with a Deer Hunter style game of Russian roulette smacks of been there, done that bought the Tee Shirt.There's also an embarrassing moment in which our hero with well defined thumbs - he likes to play video games - goes native in the jungle and Danny Boyle delivers a cringe-making scene of a computerised Leo running around like some sort of Lara Croft character.A pity that he would resort to such obvious analogies as Danny Boyle is one of the brightest hopes for British cinema - Shallow Grave, Trainspotting and A Life Less Ordinary have to be three of the finest home grown offerings of the last six years.On the production side, the soundtrack is fine and All Saints' contribution, Pure Shores, is a likeable love theme. Darius Khondji, the genius who lit Se7en and Alien Resurrection, opts for his usual grainy style, but there's little sign of the inky blacks which made AR such a glorious cinematic experience.By the finale, you won't feel short changed and there is a happy ending of sorts so the danger which went before makes this a sort of burger and fries movie where any real danger is severely compromised by a very black and white solution.However, it's very easy on the eyes, Leo gives a good performance and the ensemble cast brings very little baggage to the production so much needed credibility is maintained for as long as possible before this paradise is lost for good in a mix of happy endings and all too comfy resolution.",Null,0,0,19 February 2000
Alien," Matchless sci-fi thriller
","Twenty years after Ridley Scott directed his first Hollywood movie, it's hard to remember a time when the Alien wasn't around. Thanks to designer HR Giger, the steel toothed xenomorph became the last word in big screen extra terrestrials who kill to live and live to kill. So, two decades after the event, we have four films in an ongoing series charting the adventures of ill-fated warrant officer Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), who seems to be far more indestructible than her murderous rivals. The first of the quartet is a delirious fevered dream ride through the imagination of a fine director and an unrivalled designer. As Alien 5 gears up, give this another look if you get the chance. If you've never seen it, then beg, borrow or steal a copy and slap it into the VCR, DVD or projector tonight.",10,1,3,12 July 1999
Predator," Terrific rumble in the jungle
","Thirteen years ago, this rumble in the jungle became an instant smash, spawning comics, model kits and an engaging sequel with Danny Glover.
It also made The Matrix producer Joel Silver even more wealthy thanks to its heady mix of humour, action and special effects. The fact that it starred one of the world's biggest box office draws of the time did little to harm the project either.Back in 1987, Arnold Schwarzenegger was piping hot property. With a couple of Conan movies and The Terminator under his belt, the Austrian Oak proved that he could make millions at the box office by flexing his pecs and sneering out a series of one-liners.Arnie teamed up with director John McTiernan for what at first looked like just another Aliens clone. However, while the first half is another tale of kick ass soldiers decimated by a savage ET, the second half turns into something quite stunning.Schwarzenegger is great when he keeps his mouth shut and gives a terrific performance as the man mountain clashing with what can only be described as a Rastafarian crab-faced monster.As ever, make-up guru Stan Winston delivers a stunning foe, and while Arnie may usually be a force to be reckoned with as the buffed super soldier, Dutch, he is practically eclipsed by one of the big screen's most exciting alien creations.As you might imagine, making this 1987 classic was far from easy. It was shot on location in Mexico at Puerto Vallarta, miles from anywhere.The cast got up at 6am for breakfast and then ran four or five miles to get into condition. There were another five hours of working in the jungle on skills training - climbing trees and handling weaponry, among other things. Another two hours of weight training left them exhausted, by which time McTiernan was ready to rehearse.It's a pity the script wasn't as well honed as the cast. The dialogue by Jim and John Thomas - who wrote Executive Decision and this year's woeful Mission To Mars - is far from subtle. There are also a few dodgy moments such as the scene in which one poor troop has his arm removed, yet you can see the real limb strapped behind his back.It scarcely matters. If you can avoid the often absurd diplays of macho heroics during the first half hour and the fact that the eponymous villain seems to use a 50p paint pallette as his wrist detonator, then what develops is literally out of this world.",Null,0,0,19 September 2000
Notting Hill," A sublime carnival
","Richard Curtis penned one of the most successful British comedies ever to grace the silver screen, and in 1999, that really nice bloke who brought the world Black Adder, The Vicar of Dibley and probably saved millions through Comic Relief went and did it again.  Against all odds, Curtis reworked the Four Weddings formula, re-teamed with producer Duncan Kenworthy and star Hugh Grant to deliver one of the most likeable comedies since, well, Four Weddings.      Many of the press picked up on the Curtis formula for making hit movies and you can see their point - to a degree. Admittedly, as with Four Weddings, there is Hugh Grant (playing bookshop owner William Thacker), likeable, unsure of himself, stumbling through life without a steady partner, blessed by a close circle of friends who are all very loveable; yes there is a character with a disability, this time around it's Gina McKee in a wheelchair.    Emma Chambers - a very good, intelligent actress if you're ever lucky enough to spend half an hour in her company - plays Thacker's colurful sister; a role which in a previous incarnation would have been played by Charlotte Coleman (Scarlett from that Weddings movie). Thacker has a scummy Welsh flatmate in the form of Spike (Rhys Ifans from Twin Towns) who wears really dirty pants and even dirtier T shirts - but has a heart of gold, which comes as no surprise to anyone. So, into this happy throng comes the most famous actress on the planet - Anna (Julia Roberts). In probably her best role to date, Roberts gets a rare chance to prove that yes, she really is quite good at this thesping lark. Never for a minute do you think that, no - wait a minute - she could never be the most successful actress in the world. It's for this reason that a dinner party in honour of Thacker and his sister reveals Roberts to be really rather more than the sum of her extraordinary lips and eyes that make most normal blokes feel like they've just lost a couple of weeks in a darkened theatre - when in fact it's been about 10 seconds. Budding screenwriters should take note of Curtis' script. Six years ago he wrote an article in The Observer which was a definitive guide for any poor hack trying to make his screenplay real and come alive both on the page and on screen. It was reprinted in the really rather good Four Weddings script book (available for about a quid from all good discount book shops).   Now Curtis is quite lucky to have, as his wife, Emma Freud (also a very nice sort if you're lucky enough to chat to her for a bit). Her name pops up as script editor and you get the feeling it should have been in the main credits for if a gag works in Notting Hill, it's probably because Freud sat there till the early hours telling Curtis why he should plump for that one and not the inferior one which ended up in one of his waste paper baskets.   There are some occasionally moving scenes too. Tim McInnery helping his disabled wife into the car for that inevitable, race against time finale is something rarely seen - nor played with such throwaway conviction. Good support comes from James Dreyfus from Gimme, Gimme Gimme and The Thin Blue Line; Henry Goodman (from not bad Beeb sitcom Unfinished Business and the London stage production of Chicago), while John Shrapnel (101 Dalmatians; Gladiator) is superb as Roberts' press officer. The soundtrack is a little dubious but Elvis Costello's version of the old Charles Aznavour hit, She, works well and the score keeps things ticking over.One of the best films of 1999 which ensures you could do far worse than spend a couple of hours at this Notting Hill carnival.",9,0,0,14 October 2000
Léon: The Professional," Unmissable
","*Possible spoilers* Cancel all arrangements, put the cat out and settle back for one of the greatest movies ever made.Okay, I'm usually wary of any review that starts with those words. It's usually a recipe for disaster as your expectations are raised to the point where you are bound to be let down by the finished product.
In this case, believe the hype.The story is simple enough though unlikely to ever get cleared by a Hollywood studio on the grounds of its Lolita-like subplot. Mathilda (Star Wars' Natalie Portman in her big screen debut) is a 12-year-old New York girl who befriends Italian hitman Leon (Jean Reno in arguably his greatest performance).When her family are wiped out by DEA officers, led by a career-best Gary Oldman, she hires the eponymous assassin to avenge her brother's death.Written and directed by Gallic genius Luc Besson, the man behind classics such as Nikita and Subway, this was his first English language film and hooks the viewer from the word go.With an atmospheric score by Eric Serra and some great support from Danny Aiello, New York has never looked more Continental.Although it will lose everything on the small screen, there is a moment when Leon takes Mathilda out onto a rooftop to train her the art of assassination.The close-up of the pair against the dismal walls of their apartment block is followed by a breathtaking panorama of the Big Apple.As with any good movie, Leon is made up of such memorable scenes but what carries the film forward is the father-daughter relationship between a woman trapped in a child's body and a child trapped in a man's.Tearing the two apart is Stansfield (Oldman), a Beethoven-loving, pill popping sleazy officer who brings a degree of ferocity to the film rarely seen before or since.Oldman has always been good value for money, but his unforgettable speeches such as, 'I love these quiet moments before the storm,' are the equivalent of sending 40,000 volts from the TV set into the viewer.Luc Besson was so impressed with the actor he signed him on the spot for his big budget fantasy adventure, The Fifth Element and decided to co-produce his stunning directorial debut, Nil By Mouth.Okay, enough gushing - what's bad about it?Well, Mathilda's guardians come across like cartoon characters, but then again, so do many villains in real life so you can forgive their lack of depth. As with Goldeneye and The Fifth Element, the closing track by Eric Serra is also hideous but at least you can turn off by that point. There is also one major drawback with this version: It's not the director's cut which has just been released in this US to critical acclaim.
I was lucky enough to see the Japanese import earlier in the year and although it fleshes out the relationship between Leon and Mathilda to a very dubious degree, there's no doubt that the 'version integrale', as the art house fans like to call it, is far superior.All the characters are fleshed out more and there is one hilarious scene in which Portman and Reno get drunk in a restaurant which is little short of hilarious.Whichever version you see, be it this TV offering, a big screen print or the DVD version, there's no doubt that Besson has created a masterpiece that took a simple thriller and gave it a heart, then proceeds to break yours by the time the closing credits roll.",Null,0,1,11 October 2000
Léon: The Professional," The cleaner was butchered
","Having spent the last five years loving Luc Besson's masterpiece Leon, I finally got to see the director's cut at the weekend - and what a revelation.Unlike many movies where additional footage can often wreck the pacing, this enhances a glorious movie.Admittedly, the Version Integrale, as the arthouse crowd might call it, takes you places you don't really want to go - including Mathilda in Leon's hits and fleshing out her love for the killer does give it a sense of shock  but by the time that explosive finale arrives, you are left with a much finer movie. There's a scene where Natalie Portman giggles uncontrollably in a restaurant that is a sheer delight and begs the question that if Anna Paquin can win an Oscar for The Piano, how come NP wasn't even nominated?At the risk of sounding like an over-excited teenager who has just seen the latest piece of movie candy and has rated it best film of all time, Leon IS one of the greatest thrillers ever made but the director's cut elevates it above the butchered version that was released in the US and UK a few years ago.",Null,0,2,4 April 2000

The idea of a gold bullion heist in Turin at rush hour was deliciousand thanks to a screenplay by the excellent Troy Kennedy Martin,the Michael Caine classic has lost little of its charm over the years.
There was little point in refilming the screenplay the way Gus VanSant had done with Psycho. Instead, director F Gary Gray and thescreenwriters have done a fine job taking the best elements fromthe original movie, then changing them to suit a new story.The result is a delicious mix of action, suspense and humour thatleft this fan hungry for more.

Two)Trinity is one of the most fascinating heroines in recent years.Three) When film-makers like The Wachowski brothers haveenough time and money, they can do anything Four) In creating auniverse where we're not sure what's real, the finale does leaveyou wondering whether to cheer or wonder whether this is justanother red herring meant to confuse an already confusedaudience. However, unlike many sniffy critics who have seen this as apretentious computer game, i loved it. Big clunky exoskeletonsfighting off big squid like machines is something never seen onscreen before and when you pay five quid for a movie, that's whatyou want to see. Yes, much of the dialogue and logic is clunky but there are manypositive points here. Disappointing, fascinating, jaw-dropping, sexy, occasionally funnyand a feast for the senses. Well worth another look even though itgives some the same effect as a scratch on the roof of your mouththat just won't heal. Keep probing but eventually let it go. TMR is awonderful wound that may never heal.",Null,0,0,9 November 2003
Knowing," Knowing (it sucks) and warning you to avoid
","***This review contains spoilers *** Oh dear, where to start? Okay, for a movie obsessed with numbers, here's three you need to know: 1.12 - or rather 1hr 12 mins - the time at which this promising movie goes off the rails with an annoying twist straight out of The Forgotten and countless other poor sci-fi flicks. For a man who works at MIT, it's obvious our moping hero doesn't recognise a plot device that was used in Close Encounters back in the late seventies. Hmm, a series of random numbers. Ooh, they're all dates when disasters happen and the number of casualties. Ooh, but what are these unaccounted for numbers? Could they be co-ordinates? How about yes Nicolas Cage? Yes, they are and yes i saw the same plot device used when i was 10 years old in Close Encounters. Knowing isn't a bad film for that first 72 minutes. The plot unfolds nicely and the premise is good. Cage is okay, not great and it ticks over nicely. But as that shark looks into view at the 72min mark i found myself getting angry as the inevitable twist loomed its large, ugly head - then the movie jumped said shark. And from that point on it just got worse. Remember that annoyed feeling you may have felt at the end of Contact when Jodie Foster lands on an alien planet and it looks like something from a holiday advert (aka a complete sell out?) That's mild compared to the hideous mess of a resolution at the end of Knowing. And that last half hour of AI, with the rubbish aliens? Also as bad here, complete with a spaceship that still looks like CGI artwork pitched to the producers, complete with stupid floaty contraptions that are utterly pointless (even a fantasy film has to have some logic). As for the protracted ending in which Cage emotes to his son for what seems like days, well that's 10 minutes of my life i'll never get back. I've seen some bad films in my time but Knowing ranks up there with Rancid Aluminium as one of the worst. Three words: avoid, avoid, avoid.",1,3,6,10 April 2010
U-571," Facts aside, this is great entertainment
","As you've probably gathered by most of the other reviews here, Hollywood has once again fabricated history to suit its own ends.However, while many Brits were up in arms over Tinseltown's decision to tell their version of the Enigma code breaking events of World War Two, it's not the insult most had expected.The Enigma device is just the prime goal in what turns out to be a cracking slice of entertainment from Breakdown director Jonathan Mostow.Matthew McConaughey, up until now a pretty forgettable actor in movies like Contact and the yawnsome A Time To Kill, proves his worth as Lt Andrew Tyler, the wet behind the ears leader of a group of raw recruits sent on a special mission to retrieve the legendary encoding device.When things go pear-shaped (as expected), Tyler has to save the day.Armed with only a knackered German U boat and minimal firepower, they take on the might of the Teutonic forces in the form of a battleship which is rarely seen but often heard.Including Jon Bon Jovi in the movie was a dubious choice but he works quite well in support and although the special effects are okay, the limitations don't get in the way of the action.As with Gladiator, this is cracking old fashioned entertainment of the type they used to make 40 years ago. Tense direction, some dubious casting (the excellent Bill Paxton and Harvey Keitel look very out of place) and cracking pacing make this well above average. Had it not been, I suppose it would have been, er, sub-standard entertainment.",Null,0,1,13 June 2000
Pearl Harbor," One third awful, two thirds great
","The first hour of this war epic is enough to make most intelligent people turn off in disgust. The script is hilariously bad, the characters are wooden and unbelievable while director Michael Bay's irritating habit of letting few scenes last longer than a second, intercutting every other scene with a crane shot gets on the nerves. Randall Wallace's dialogue seems to have been inspired by war comics where chracters shout: Aiieeee! when the die. The British come across is incompetent without the aid of good old Ben Affleck while the Japanese only ever say crucial dialogue such as: We have enough information...Everything is spelled out for the lowest common denominator which is a real shame as technically this is a fantastic movie. Great lighting and sets, costumes by Michael Kaplan and the hilarious habit that characters have of standing in front of design classics. Blood transfusions are even carried out with the aid of classic Coke bottles. However, once the attack begins about an hour in, things get really interesting.Take out the first hour and this could have been something really special instead of a desperate attempt to merge Top Gun with Titanic.",Null,0,1,20 January 2002
Schindler's List," The most important film of the last 50 years
","In the same week that ET opened in America, Steven Spielberg read Thomas Keneally's Schindler's Ark, the book based on the true story of one man who rescued more than 1,000 Jews from under the noses of the Nazis.
Intrigued by the subject, the film rights were snapped up and the result was the most talked about movie of the Nineties.Schindler's List rarely fails to stir the emotions. As with all of the cast - especially Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes - Liam Neeson gives the performance of a lifetime as the suave businessman Oskar Schindler, spurred on by the brief that as many people as possible should see the movie - and not just from a commercial point of view, as Neeson recalled at the time of release.`I remember Steven saying Don't take this wrong, but I want everyone in the world to see this film,' and I knew exactly what he meant.'It goes without saying that the Holocaust was such an horrific event that any director would have to feel mature enough to tell their story without letting sentiment get in the way. So, 10 years after he first read the book, the master movie-maker was ready to tackle the most important film of his career.He had a self-confessed reluctance to confront the Holocaust and his own Jewishness as a subject. Following his more human' dramas such as The Color Purple and Empire of the Sun, the project was still very much in his mind, but his own involvement would be purely on a production level. After offering it to fellow film directors Martin Scorsese and Sydney Pollack, they both turned it down and Hollywood's favourite son was left to condense the novel into a three-hour black and white movie.Having successfully fleshed out many of his childhood fantasies and with events in the Balkans at the time mirroring those of fifty years earlier, 1993 was exactly the right time to address the matter.So keen was Spielberg to make the film, he left the Hawaiian set of Jurassic Park before the film's completion and flew to Poland to start filming.Old friend George Lucas was left to edit the dinosaur blockbuster while Steven watched the footage on descrambled satellite transmissions.Both films went on to achieve widespread acclaim, for different reasons. If JP was the sort of a movie an overexcited child would make, then SL was that of a seasoned film-maker at ease with his craft and intent on delivering something extremely adult.Schindler's List received 12 Oscar nominations, including the elusive Best Director gong which Steven eventually picked up from an Academy that had ignored many of his movies on the grounds that he had been rewarded enough.Tackling a drama in which six million people ended up dead was not for the novice film-maker - It was for the brave of heart and a director that could tell such a stark tale without alienating his audience from the outset.Indeed, only Claude Lanzmann had delivered anything that came close with his epic film Shoah, a nine and a half hour documentary about the Holocaust which wowed the critics in 1985.For his movie, Spielberg was blessed with a polished screenplay by Steve Zaillian, a young writer who went on to direct his own movies such as the John Travolta vehicle, A Civil Action, and who has just spruced up the dialogue for Silence of the Lambs sequel, Hannibal.Needless to say, this not the sort of movie you curl up with on a Saturday night with a box of chocs and a six pack. It's a harrowing film which has lost none of its power either on the small screen or in the eight years since its release.",10,12,18,16 January 2001
The Mist," A masterpiece
","***The following contains spoilers *** Great horror films are few and far between thanks to the fact many lazy film-makers stick to the tried and tested routine of unstoppable serial killers and rarely address more original ideas. Thankfully, writer/director Frank Darabont is a far more intelligent director who wisely returned to the rich source material of Stephen King for this stunning classic. Shot at breakneck speed on a modest budget, his movie features a terrific ensemble cast, a great script and nail-biting scenes. Luckily the weakest visual effects sequence, involving a tentacle in a supermarket loading bay, doesn't get in the way of the rest of the drama, and once that is out the way, the rest is a sheer roller-coaster ride. Much has been written about the ending, so i won't repeat it here. But just to say for a film-maker to opt for such a brave ending knowing it will affect box office takings takes some guts. Long after all those bleak horror movies with a happy ending have faded from the memory, The Mist will linger as a tribute to its incredible cast and crew. 10/10.",10,1,4,13 September 2009
Moulin Rouge!," Breathtaking
","A few days before seeing the movie, I watched Baz Luhrmann selling the film in Cannes and all over the States thanks to a BBC documentary. I was sold on the film just from seeing an army of suited guys giving an operatic rendition of Smells Like Teen Spirit - and that's not even one per cent of this film's brilliance.In perhaps the bleakest year for big screen offerings, MR is one of the most welcome movies of 2001. A treat to look at, fast, funny, daring, sexy, rousing, exciting - everything a good movie should be. But if the set design and music weren't there, then it would still have worked purely because of the chemistry between Nicole and Ewan. They look like they're having fun which is worth the price of admission alone.An instant masterpiece.",10,1,2,12 September 2001
The Graduate," So here's to you, Dustin Hoffman
","When Jerry Hall stripped off the other week in the West End version of The Graduate, the tabloids went into a frenzy over what must be one of the hottest shows in London.
If you can't get to the capital or don't fancy the idea of shelling out a packet for the privilege of seeing the leggy Texan as Mrs Robinson, you could always do the next best thing and watch the movie which inspired it.
Yes, when it comes to classic Sixties comedies, few are better than Mike Nichols' movie about a love tryst which defined an era.There are four main reasons to choose this over the competition: Dustin Hoffman in his big screen debut, Anne Bancroft at her sexiest as the mature woman who tries to seduce him; Nichols' direction and best of all, that Simon and Garfunkel soundtrack. Who could forget smash hits like The Sound of Silence and Mrs Robinson?As with any great movie, this has been used as inspiration for a number of other films and TV shows, including Wayne's World 2 and one hilarious episode of The Simpsons in which grandpa recreates the memorable wedding ceremony - with chaotic results. George Michael also got in on the act when he sampled Hoffman's dialogue for one of his funky numbers a few years ago. Needless to say, he wasted little time getting a ticket for the Hall performance.But back to the movie. In the early days of production, the director offered the pivotal role of Mrs Robinson to Doris Day who turned it down because she said 'It offended my sense of values.' Well, can you see Doris attempting to seduce a young man? Thought not.Robert Redford and Candice Bergen were also called in to read but they were not quite right. It was a brave move to choose the unknown Dustin Hoffman over a box office favourite yet that decision gave the green light for many more New York stage actors to make the break in Hollywood.The movie became the talk of the town in 1967 and was one of the favourites to reap an armful of Oscars, going up against Bonnie and Clyde and Guess Who's Coming To Dinner?Mike Nichols eventually walked away with Best Director - a plaudit which turned him into one of the hottest film-makers on the planet, although his follow-up, Catch-22, proved less than memorable.Hoffman also became a solid gold star whose meticulous approach to his craft would become legendary. With roles such as Midnight Cowboy, Marathon Man and Papillon all affirming his status as one of the best thesps in the business.",Null,0,1,14 August 2000
Avatar," Believe the hype
","James Cameron has always been a visionary director, since he burst onto an unsuspecting world with The Terminator in 1984. At $6million, that movie was anticipated by almost nobody; the big film of that Orwellian year was Dune - at $40million, the most expensive film ever made. Fast forward to 2009, a Cameron returns from more than a decade in the film-making wilderness to deliver his most expensive, ambitious film yet. It's rare for any movie to live up to they hype these days, and at a cost of $300million, the critics were sharpening their quills to stab at the self proclaimed king of the world. Comparisons to Ferngully and Halo were rife, but Avatar quickly buries those small minded, trite jibes; this is the real deal, and every penny of its price tag is up there on the big screen. The 3d is as immersive as you'd hope from any big screen blockbuster which requests grown men and women sit in chilly cinemas looking like refugees from the golden era of the 1950s - aka rather ridiculous. James Cameron's script might not be the most polished in the world, but on a comic book, teenage level it works wonders, and it's hard not to be gripped by some of the best action scenes committed to celluloid. Will it make it's money back? Only time will tell. However, for one 41-year-old who has grown up loving most of Cameron's work, the fact i could quite happily sit through the movie again a couple of hours after watching it suggests it will make a pile of cash from repeat business. Do yourself a favour, get to the biggest cinema screening it with a pair of 3d glasses, sit back and enjoy the ride. For once you can believe the hype.",10,4,9,20 December 2009
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Terrific sequel
","As a rule of thumb, the third movie in any film series is usually very polished and often a little too familiar. Such is the case with The Godfather, Return of the Jedi and Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome. Very rarely, there's a film that bucks the trend and manages to reinvigorate a lucrative franchise.Die Hard With A Vengeance, John McTiernan's superb second sequel to his classic 1988 thriller, is that rare exception to the rule.
By now, NYPD cop John McClane (Bruce Willis) has become as famous as Dirty Harry - a gritty, foul mouthed hero who could be the average bloke in the street. He has a rubbish love life (wife Bonnie Bedelia from the previous films has called it a day for this offering); has a little trouble in getting up in the morning, as the opening scenes prove, and has a terrible habit of wrecking just about everything he comes into contact with.So what is it about DHWAV that makes it a cut above the average sequel? Writer Jonathan Hensleigh (one of the brains behind Willis' Armageddon) sat down and came up with a cat and mouse game which takes McClane beyond the confines of a skyscraper or airport as seen in parts one and two. Here he has the whole of New York City to devastate, with a little help from nemesis, Simon (Jeremy Irons).The fact that he's supposed to be terrorist Hans Gruber's brother seems a little convenient but does at least provide the necessary fuel for Simon's personal vendetta against McClane. From the opening, explosive shot of NYC on a hot day - the addition of the Lovin Spoonfull's Summer in the City is an added bonus - you know this is one piece of Eurotrash that means business.Before long, a hungover McClane is chasing around the Big Apple, incensing the locals with a far from politically correct sandwich board and trying to solve tricky maths problems with the aid of shopkeeper Zeus Carver (Samuel L Jackson). Failure will result in another bomb being detonated, courtesy of Simon.Both Willis and Jackson have the sort of onscreen chemistry that works a treat and the NYPD Blue style photography - all hand held cameras - gives this epic the feel of a documentary. None of the lush cinematography of parts one and two here. The film is not without its faults. After a terrific first half, the plot seems to get out of control and McClane and Zeus appear like cartoon characters as they risk life and limb to stop the mad Simon. However, McTiernan manages to add lashings of tension to the proceedings and proves that with this and current big screen hits The 13th Warrior and The Thomas Crown Affair, he is one of the most dynamic directors working in Hollywood today.It wasn't a cheap film to make by any means but it seems the $90million budget was a good gamble after the movie grossed over $354million around the world.",Null,0,0,15 December 1999
Trainspotting," Addictive stuff
","Hard to believe it's five years since Danny Boyle's classic film Trainspotting took the world by storm but while you ask yourself what has happened since it opened on March 8, 1996, just reflect on the movie's legacy for a minute.Just about every firm in the UK borrowed its ad campaign; Ewan McGregor, Robert Carlyle, Jonny Lee Miller and Kelly MacDonald became huge stars while Boyle himself went on to make the sublime A Life Less Ordinary and current video release, The Beach.As for the soundtrack? Iggy Pop, Leftfield, Blur and Pulp helped turn it into one of the biggest sellers of the year.In case you didn't know it, the movie was based on a cult novel by Irvine Welsh who writes largely in broad Scots and makes an appearance as drug dealer, Mother Superior. `He's called that on account of the length of his habit,' remarks Renton (McGregor). While the movie was seen by many sniping critics to be glorifying drug culture, what it actually did was far more clever than any `Just Say No' ad campaign by the cast of Grange Hill. By taking the (at the time) radical viewpoint that the drug culture exists, the film-makers didn't judge. Instead, Trainspotting depicted the squalid lives of its inhabitants and the ultimately fatal consequences of being a heroin addict.Boyle, producer Andrew MacDonald and writer John Hodge amazed the British film-making community when they made such a hit movie on home turf.Even before their outstanding debut, Shallow Grave, was released, producer Scott (The Firm) Rudin was offering them $250,000 to make any big screen project they wanted.Most people expected them to upstumps and set up camp in America, like so many film-types lured to the States by the big bucks.The cash may be great in la la land but creative freedom? Not a chance. Had Trainspotting been shot across the pond, there's a good chance it would have been made as a comedy vehicle for Jim Carrey - or whoever else was big at the time. The drug element would have been removed completely and the addiction would have probably been something safe like chocolate or coffee.As for the ambiguous title? Forget that.Thankfully, Danny and company stayed put and delivered one of the best British films of the last decade. A biting, shocking satire which goes for the jugular and stays in the mind no matter how much you'd like to forget it.The sight of a baby crawling along the ceiling of Renton's bedroom remains one of the most shocking dream sequences I've ever seen. Three days later it kept returning like an unwanted guest that just won't leave.No movie is created in a vacuum and the Trainspotting crew borrowed heavily from another cult flick for their inspiration: A Clockwork Orange.The near inaudible scene in the Volcano nightclub is almost a carbon copy of the Velocet Milk Bar from that Stanley Kubrick classic and in a fine in-joke, even features a track by Heaven 17 (who took their moniker from the same controversial movie.)If you only see five minutes, don't miss Renton attempting to seduce Diane as his libido returns with a vengeance. Aside from boasting one of the best shots in the movie as they leave the club, it also features Kelly MacDonald delivering some delicious dialogue.",Null,1,1,8 January 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Peerless

But having waited with the rest of the world for two years to see thisconclusion, nausea would be kept at bay for the next three hoursand something. What unfolded was one of theose movies you remember forever,despite it being just a day and a half since it was over. Hollywood is going to have a hard time recreating the level ofexcellence on display here and although some bits were dubious -Legolas on the Olymphant was a CGI lowpoint, the rest of themovie was a stunning treat. Finally a director has told a story inwhich computer effects, actors and craftsmen get the chance toshine, none of which was at the expense of the story. There were far too many endings and Jackson could have donewith cutting 20 mins from the finale. However, you certainly get your money's worth and it deserves allthe praise and awards that will be heaped on it in the months thatfollow.",10,1,2,21 December 2003
Cube," Tension squared
","Employing the old adage less is more, Cube has just one main set, although it is reused with different lighting and effects to form separate cells of a larger cube.Into this mathematically perfect, lethal prison are a handful of eclectic strangers, each with their own special gift. One is a cop; another is obsessed with conspiracy theories; the youngest is a maths genius; there's a con man and an inmate with a dark secret. There's also an autistic young man who ups the tension several notches when our heroes have to go from one cell to another - except any sound they make could result in instant death from acoustically primed traps. The script is fresh and original; the cast likeable and engaging with the added bonus that none of them carries the baggage of several similar sci-fi offerings to interrupt your suspension of disbelief. Having seen this in the same week as the yawnsome Arnie offering End of Days, there's no doubt that this is the stronger film made for a fraction of the budget and with some far better actors. The movie looks great with the pacing and action never hindered by the rather claustrophobic setting. There's also a highly addictive soundtrack which has all the impact of a waking dream.
Nicole de Boer as the brainy Leaven is an attractive heroine without having the jaw dropping charm of Gillian Anderson. Director Vincenzo Natali also looks like being a name to watch although it's a pity that with a larger budget and more expansive sets, his talent could be diluted by a broader canvas. We shall see.",10,0,1,18 December 1999
Apollo 13," What a ride
","If summer blockbusters were collectively defined as a person then 1995's cache would be Victor Meldrew: Tired, irascible and beset by problems.Batman Forever was a glossy and forgettable romp; Die Hard With A Vengeance a fuel-injected monster that turned cops and robbers into a Ben Hur style adventure. Then there was Waterworld and Judge Dredd, two sci-fi adventures which cost about the same as the Third World debt and yet delivered so little.They were all modest successes plagued by mishaps - the whole floating set of Waterworld sunk - but there was a definite sense of Hollywood losing its way without the likes of James Cameron, Steven Spielberg or George Lucas to show them the way. Luckily for Apollo 13, Ron Howard - a Lucas protege - decided to stick to a more realistic subject matter than those caped crusaders or moist Mad Maxes.With the help of Cameron's effects company Digital Domain and the Midas touch of Tom Hanks (as Jim Lovell), Howard brought to the big screen a gripping tale of three astronauts trying to get back to earth when all hell breaks loose on their eponymous spacecraft.On a critical level, Apollo 13 succeeded where so many other movies failed by spending a little more time on the characters than on the derivative eye candy. It also tapped into the nostalgic hopes and fears of so many people growing up watching those fuzzy black and white news reports in the late Sixties and early Seventies.The Apollo moonshots were ripe for Hollywood exploitation so it seems strange that no-one had attempted the programme's ill-fated adventure earlier. If landing on the moon was part of the American dream, then this was, without doubt, the American nightmare. Watching how the crew at NASA - led by the excellent Ed Harris - solve the problem of getting the desperate astronauts back home with next to no fuel and far from compliant equipment will leave your heart in your mouth.Although the third act was written in reality 30 years ago, Howard has you gripped throughout, partly because he went to extraordinary lengths to achieve a degree of realism for the movie. While effects could successfully remove any wires holding up actors these days, many of the zero gravity effects were achieved by taking cast and crew up in a special aircraft and then filming certain scenes while the plane went into a zero G nose-dive.If you're a gadgets whiz, then chances are you'll already be watching in ear shattering stereo but if not then it might be time to invest in the relevant equipment - if only for that launch scene.As Apollo 13's engines fire and ice breaks away from the body of the craft, you'll be slack of jaw as the sound crew give you the sort of experience only usually possible by strapping your head to the space shuttle.For that alone, it's an unmissable experience. Watch it all and you may need a good lie down.",Null,1,1,20 December 1999
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Unfinished masterpiece
","There have been many attempts to tell the King Arthur legend over the years.
John Boorman gave it a go with the blood-soaked Excalibur in 1981 and one of the Zucker brothers toned down the blood shed for a Disneyland version with First Knight in 1995.However, one of the greatest versions takes a few liberties with the tale of Excalibur and the king of the Britons. Monty Python and the Holy Grail was the debut feature from those naughty college lads, John Cleese, Graham Chapman, Eric Idle, Michael Palin and Terry Gilliam. Made for next to nothing - Â£229,000 in case you were wondering - it is still one of their best looking movies with an irreverence sorely lacking in most expensive comedies these days.The budget was raised by a host of rich rock stars such as Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd, all keen to spend their money on something rather than have it snaffled by the tax man.Directed by the two Terrys - the Pythons believed that anyone in their merry band called Terry could be a director - it was not an easy shoot by any means with Gilliam and Jones pulling in opposite directions while the far from happy cast moaned about the conditions.John Cleese was well miffed when he had to wait for hours in the cold while Gilliam waited for the sun to set. The Fawlty Towers star believed they should just shoot the film and get out of there but Gilliam wanted to give his movie the look of a painting by Bruegel or Bosch.It's 25 years since the movie was released and for many of us, we've had to put up with a quarter century of party bores trying to impress us with impersonations of the Knights who say Ni! - probably the world's easiest impression - and countless other snippets of dialogue from the movie.One of the film's many strengths is its lack of cash. The cast and crew couldn't afford horses so they had the leads running allong knocking coconut shells together. Aside from being far funnier than anything Mel Brooks could have done in a multi-million dollar spoof like Robin Hood: Men in Tights, it also proved that necessity really is the mother of invention.The team, of course, went on to bigger and better things in the years that followed with Gilliam returning to the genre with his flawed fairy tale Jabberwocky in 1977 and another Grail-related legend, The Fisher King in 1991. He is currently trying to save his long cherished lottery funded project, The Man Who Killed Don Quixote, from going belly up in Spain.Terry Jones went on to direct the ultra controversial Python flick Life of Brian four years after this and then delivered disappointing offerings in the Eighties such as Personal Services and Erik the Viking.The latter had a huge budget but sadly none of the chemistry on display here.A pity the ending of MPATHG proves to be such a cop out. As with other cult classics from the era, Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Vanishing Point, the abrupt ending (clearly a sign of the cash running out) made many yearn for more.",Null,0,0,22 November 2000
Braveheart," Brave movie
","When Mel Gibson announced that he was to make Braveheart, a drama based on the life of the Scots hero William Wallace, the movie world scratched their head in disbelief.Was this the same Mel Gibson who, up to that point, had directed The Man Without A Face and little else? The same actor who made a string of hit and miss Lethal Weapon movies?Admittedly, he gave a fine turn in Hamlet (1990) but the thought of him in a kilt with a Scottish accent left many of us wondering if he was setting himself up for a huge fall.But Mel is no fool.With a polished script by Randal Wallace, he donned a mullet wig - looking suspiciously like the scalp of one hit wonder Billy Ray Cyrus - and proved the critics wrong by delivering one of the greatest historical epics ever committed to celluloid.You want impressive battle scenes? Braveheart has them in abundance - the recreated battle of Stirling Bridge was recently in the top 100 of classic movie scenes according to one Sunday broadsheet poll. What about a wealth of acting talent? How does Patrick McGoohan, Bond babe Sophie Marceau and the late Ian Bannen sound? A rousing soundtrack? Titanic's James Horner takes a bow with his stirring orchestral work.In case your history is a little rusty, here's the lowdown: William Wallace (Gibson) was a hero who fought for Scotland's freedom in the late 13th century, intent on defeating the forces of King Edward I (Patrick McGoohan), the British monarch who had declared himself king of Scotland upon the former ruler's death.Much of the early film concentrates on Wallace's love for Murron (Catherine McCormack). That creates a likeable hero whose eventual loss gives him motive for the carnage that ensues. As Scotland's noble folk clash over land and riches, William Wallace stands for the individual, and earns much kudos for being ready to die for what he believes in.While Gibson supplies his usual dose of charisma by the cartload, an aged Patrick McGoohan, best known from The Prisoner, is barely recognisable under a white beard. His Edward the Longshanks is one of the greatest screen villains in history; intelligent, equally as charming as Wallace and more ruthless than a dozen Bond villains. Pity the poor fool who crosses him - or even makes a passing comment - as they soon manage to find the fastest route from the top of his castle to the courtyard floor.Sophie Marceau, the French actress from The World is Not Enough, plays Princess Isabelle, while Blighty's own Catherine McCormack is attractive and credible as Wallace's beloved Murron.Braveheart is littered with fine points and Hollywood wasn't too slow in recognising Gibson's achievements, awarding him and his crew five Oscars.The movie's success left box office tills ringing around the world and it wasn't long before the $72million budget was justified with a $202million worldwide gross. Braveheart inspired a host of imitators in the five years since its release, including a robotic version of the battle scene in last summer's The Phantom Menace and a hilarious take off in South Park, with Chef standing in as the blue-faced hero.Amid the blood and carnage here, star spotters should keep an eye out for Alun Armstrong - seen recently in the Yorkshire Ripper drama, This is Personal; ex-Coronation Street bad guy Steven Billington (Greg Kelly) as the ill-fated Phillip and Peter Mullan from acclaimed Ken Loach drama, My Name is Joe.It's a long film so you'll need plenty of cushions and the humble old telly just can't compete with those glorious landscapes. But with that taken as red, forget about what's missing from the movie and revel in that dialogue.If you can only see one scene, make sure it's the moment with William Wallace riding back and forth in front of his troops waxing lyrical in an attempt to inspire his forces.Watch, listen and feel the hairs rise on the back of your neck as he makes his plea: `Ay, fight and you may die, run and you'll live. At least a while. And dying in your beds many years from now, would you be willing to trade all the days from this day to that for one chance, just one chance to come back here and tell our enemies that they may take our lives, but they'll never take our freedom.'",Null,0,1,9 February 2000

","You know you're getting old when film-makers start making fun of 1985 fashions.While many of us have been wondering what happened to last 15 years, director Frank Coraci and star Adam Sandler have woven a whole film with a mid-Eighties backdrop - ideal for the target audience who were in nappies while Live Aid rocked the world.Sandler plays the eponymous crooner who falls for an impossibly sweet waitress (Drew Barrymore). It's the usual tale of boy meets girl; boy loses girl; boy and girl may or may not get back together with the help of Billy Idol.Okay, so the last bit may not be a well-worn cliche but you get the picture.While Drew Barrymore has been a big screen regular since 1982, up until last summer, most movie goers this side of the pond were wondering Adam who? Then he scored his first crossover hit with this surprisingly charming comedy and things were never quite the same again.Unlike previous big screen offerings, Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison, Sandler and director Coraci kept the gags pretty clean and won millions of new fans as a result.It helped that the script by Tim Herlihy received a polish from Carrie Fisher and the supporting cast boasted the talents of both Armageddon's Steve Buscemi and Saturday Night Live graduate Jon Lovitz.Of course, one of the benefits of making a comedy from not so long ago is poking fun at an age when the internet in the home was a pipe dream and the future of many a top selling band hung in the balance, as Robbie (Sandler) pleads to his ex-girlfriend: 'Now please get out of my Van Halen T-shirt before you jinx the band and they break up.' Having grossed over $80million in the States alone, this low budget offering was the comedy hit of 1998 - at least until There's Something About Mary was released anyway.New Line Cinema are so determined to hang onto America's hottest comedy property, they don't mind shelling out $20million a picture to keep the star on their books.A cash driven sentiment reflected in The Wedding Singer.'Well, we're living in a material world,' remarks Robbie. 'and I'm a material girl. Or Boy.'",Null,1,1,14 December 1999
Beetlejuice," Fun
","It's funny how some films work out. In a parallel universe, Beetlejuice could have starred Sammy Davis Jr and been called House Ghosts.                     However, the eventual Tim Burton classic became a star vehicle for Michael Keaton, launched Winona Ryder onto an unsuspecting world and made the tousle-haired director a force to be reckoned with in Hollywood.                     The 1988 horror comedy concerns a bland young couple (played by Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) who die in a freak accident and have to suffer a pretentious family who move into their dream house while they are doomed to spend an eternity in the afterlife.                     Unlike your classic cherubs and pearly gates vision of heaven, Burton's view of the afterlife is more like a garish dole office/airport waiting room. Tim was attracted to the project after spending a few years wondering what to do next. His hilarious Pee Wee's Big Adventure had mixed reviews and he was being offered all manner of formulaic flicks. Then media mogul David Geffen (one of the brains behind behind Dreamworks) suggested he take a look at this spooky tale and the director was hooked from page one.                      'It had no real story, it didn't make any sense, it was just a stream of consciousness,' he remarked in one interview.                     The flick was written by Michael McDowell and polished up by Warren Skaaren. However, much of the genius behind the dialogue comes from Keaton as the eponymous bio-exorcist.                     Burton and his leading man spent many days developing the character from scratch, with Keaton trying different teeth and voices to get the feel of the 'Ghost with the most.'                     It was not all plain sailing however. Burton grew tired of the studio questioning every little detail about his movie.                     'I remember having script meetings that lasted for like 24 hours over the course of two days, and by the end of it we were questioning every element of the script, which for me, is not necessarily that productive.'                     The studio had run all manner of marketing tests with the title Beetlejuice and it scored very low compared to House Ghosts which made a lot of people sit up and take notice.                     Tim was naturally incensed by such tampering with his baby. 'As a joke I said why don't we call it Scared Sheetless? and they actually considered it until I said I'd jump out of the window.'                     The movie - title intact - was made for a measly $13million, with a mere $1million given over to special effects. On a movie of this size which is so effects driven, it's amazing that Burton managed to make the flick come alive. However, there's a wonderful cheesiness to the visual gags that make the whole thing work far better than the multi million dollar effects shot on that year's other big movie, Willow.
                     The horror comedy eventually grossed (no pun intended) more than $73million and picked up an Oscar for the make-up crew.                     As with most hit movies, it spawned a cartoon series, influenced the look of many an advert around the time and at one point, there looked like being a sequel - Beetlejuice in Love.                     Alas, that was put on a backburner. Burton soon had his hands full directing the first two Batman movies, Edward Scissorhands, Mars Attacks! and one of this year's best films, Sleepy Hollow.                     So what about next year? Any chance of another helping of spooky shenanigans?                     Afraid not. Tim is now hard at work on The Visitor, a big budget remake of Planet of the Apes with Mark Wahlberg and Fight Club's Helena Bonham Carter.",Null,0,1,29 November 2000
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Not the Coens best best but still very good
","O Brother, thank you for the Coen Brothers. While most film-makers stick to the routine love story or thriller and offer very little new to either genre, Joel and Ethan Coen have always delivered the good by lifting from the best, and then giving their unique spin to things.Their last couple of films, Fargo (1996) and The Big Lebowski (1998) were unmissable gems that received much deserved praise from the critics and public alike.The latest may not be in the same class but is certainly a lot of fun.It also proves that this is the year for George Clooney, this being the third of his most intriguing films, after The Perfect Storm and Three Kings.This movie features regular players John Turturro and John Goodman mixed in with all manner of bizarre goings on.It also marks a wonderful return to form for Holly Hunter who has yet to give a bad performance and was sublime in the Coen's 1986 classic, Raising Arizona.The title was inspired by a joke in Preston Sturges' comedy Sullivan's Travels. I must confess, I've never seen the film but it's only a matter of time. Hollywood and film fans clearly love this movie and after Steve Martin mentioned it in Lawrence Kasdan's Grand Canyon (1992), it's one of those on the must see movie list.Part musical, comedy and fantasy, it is set in Depression-era Deep South and follows clever dick Everett (Clooney) a man who is more concerned about his hair than anything else, Pete (Turturro) and none-too-bright Delmar (director Tim Blake Nelson) - a band of convicts who escape from a chain gang to find hidden treasure.Naturally with the Coens' movies, things are never that easy. For the movie is inspired by Homer's 'Odyssey' and the lads bump into all sorts of nutcases on their journey, including a one-eyed bible salesman (Goodman) and a wannabe mayoral candidate (Charles Durning).With some excellent bluegrass music, including a fine track by Clooney and The Soggy Bottom Boys, this is one of the year's most original movies that seems to have arrived fully formed into the world.Most flicks are rather obviously the work of special effects crews and a team of writers desperately trying to glean some magic from the subject material but this has a strange simplicity. The Coen's have a knack of making their films look effortless, but you know that behind the scenes, they must have been burning the midnight oil to get every element right.A special nod should also go to Roger Deakins for his washed out photography.It gives OBWAT that period feel while costume designers and set crew must have had a field day recreating an era seen all too rarely on the big screen.",Null,0,0,17 September 2000
