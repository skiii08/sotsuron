The Blair Witch Project," You'll Never See Another Like It
","Love it or hate it, but you can say that you'll never see another movie like The Blair Witch Project.I was very fortunate to see this movie at the very first showing at 2AM on a Friday morning.  I had seen the commercials on tv for it, but that's all I knew about it.  In fact, if it wasn't for some idiots who were standing in front of me in line, I would've gone into this movie thinking it was real. So basically I saw this movie before all the real hype came out about it, but I will be totally honest with you, I loved it!We are so, for want of a better word, corrupted by the Horror genre now-a-days.  All of my life has been filled with Jason, Michael & Freddy, which was not a bad thing when those movies were original, but now we so picky when a scary movie comes out, that we blow it out.  Blair Witch was so suspenseful because you never see the 'witch' and there are parts of this movie that literally scare the H-E-Double Hockey Sticks out of you.I don't agree with the people who call this movie 'The Scariest Movie Ever', but it sure had me gripping the seat handles at the theater, and I thought about the movie for weeks after.  It was original and I tell everyone who hasn't seen it to catch it.",Null,0,1,30 March 2002
Gremlins," I Blame My Youth
","I grew up in the 80's. I look back at that time with great memories. From the clothes to the cars to the music and movies, my life was pretty decent back then.I sometimes like to 'relive' my youth and watch some movies that I remember liking as a youngster. Some of the movies still hold up as being great movies...Indiana Jones, Back to the Future, Star Wars, Die Hard to name a few. Others are not so great...Crocodile Dundee, Mannequin and Gremlins fit into this category. The concept of this film is fairly great, and I give thumbs up to Chris Columbus for writing a decent script...well, half a script.
The first half of this movie isn't too annoying, but when the Gremlins start their wicked ways, I feel like I'm watching an overblown SNL skit. The amount of juvenile humor is just plain annoying. This is one of those movies that was well talked about back in 1984, but cannot stand the test of time.The highlight of this movie for me this time around was seeing the Back to the Future set being used. Granted, Gremlins came out first, but the clock tower will forever be known for Back to the Future.",Null,8,17,22 February 2003
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Worst Movie Ever?????
","I have read many reviews, not just on this website, but from critics nationwide, and a lot of people are ranking this movie as one of the worst movies ever!Now, I will give you guys the fact that it isn't as good as the orginal 'Star Wars', or 'Empire' for that matter, but I think it was hands down better than 'Return of the Jedi'.  Not only that, but there is no movie in the entire history of movies that could've lived up to the hype that Phantom Menace recieved.  NOT ONE!Yes, Jar Jar was annoying, Jake Lloyd wasn't a great actor (but neither was Mark Hamill in Star Wars.) but the fight scenes between the Jedis and Maul were incredible.  Much better than anything from the original Trilogy.  I think Natalie Portman was perfect, as was Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor.
For those of you that say that this is one of the worst movies ever, I have a list of movies that you need to watch, and trust me, The Phantom Menace will be one of your favorites.",Null,0,1,12 July 2001
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Oh My Heck! I LOVE This Movie!
","You can read any review about this movie, and you'll see the same thing: 'Classic!', 'My Favorite Movie!', 'Amazing!', 'Rollercoaster Ride!', 'The Best Ever!'Let me add my own phrase into the mix.  'Oh My Heck!' Okay, so I didn't actually make up that phrase, since it is the official phrase for the State of Utah, but I remember, at the age nine, sitting in the theater after the whole beginning sequence of 'Raiders' and turning to my brother and saying, 'Oh my heck!  This movie is so cool!'TRUE STORY (with some minor Spoilers): The large popcorn that my brother & I were sharing was gone before Belloq even stole the golden idol from Indy. For those of you who haven't seen this movie (shame on you) that means within the first fifteen minutes.Harrison Ford did something amazing in this movie.  He made me forget that he was Han Solo.  All I saw was a man named Indiana Jones doing things that any nine year old would want to do when they grew up.I'm sure that most people who are reading this review have actually seen 'Raiders', but to those of you who haven't, what are you waiting for?  Get off your duff and run out and buy this movie.  It is seriously a 'Classic, Amazing Rollercoaster Ride' that is truly 'my favorite Adventure movie of all time!'",Null,0,0,4 January 2003
Wayne's World," If You're Gonna Spew...
","Now that I have you're attention!  Out of all the 'SNL' movies, only a few have passed the test on the big screen.  I know that some people will argue with me on this point, but I'll give you an idea of some real stinkers...'It's Pat'- The three minute sketch that drove you nuts turned into a 90 minute movie.  UGH! 'The Coneheads'- The sketch wasn't that funny!  Really, it wasn't. 'Stuart Saves His Family'- Was I the only one who thought this was a waste of film and popcorn?Plus, I'm not even going to mention all the horrible movies that the stars of SNL have been part of...okay maybe just one...'Little Nicky'.Anyway, 'Wayne's World' is one of the rare movies that actually worked as a full-length feature movie.Maybe it's due to the fact that I actually have friends like Wayne & Garth, or maybe it's because Mike Myers is a genius, but I think this movie is fabulous.Yes, it's over-quoted...well I should say, it was over-quoted.  You don't really hear guys saying 'As if' or 'Schwing' anymore...except my friends that I mentioned before, but it is just too funny watching these two guys being two guys.  Plus all the references to other movies and TV shows are wonderful.Let us not forget...ALICE COOPER!!!!!!!If you've never experienced 'Wayne's World', check it out.  You never know, it could be the best movie that you've ever seen.  Yeah, right!  And monkeys might fly out of...",Null,0,1,24 June 2002
Spice World," What Did You Expect?
","You know, when I see the name 'Julia Roberts' on a movie, I usually do my best to avoid that movie.  Why?  Because I don't personally like Ms. Roberts.  I'm sure she's a very nice woman, but she and her movies just don't do anything for me.Now, I realize that Julia Roberts is not in 'Spice World', but I'm making a point.  If you see 'Spice World' starring the Spice Girls in your local Hollybuster video store and you've never really liked the Spice Girls, you probably won't like this movie.  That's not too difficult to figure out, or so I thought until I read some of the reviews here.  Did they think that Baby Spice would win an Oscar for her performance?  Did they think that a movie 'based' on the Girls' lives would be thought-provoking?  Maybe they just thought that this would be the first PG-rated movie with full nudity.  I can't figure it out.I personally like the Spice Girls.  They seem like they are a lot of fun, and their music is upbeat.  To be honest, I think that they brought us out of the drudge of Grunge and Hard-core rap that we were experiencing in the mid-90's.  They brought the happiness back to music.On the other hand, I blame them fully for the popularity of all these teeny-bopper singers that have invaded my radio, but that's not my point.'Spice World' is just a fun little movie that is a guilty pleasure for me and many other people.  Like I said before, if you don't like the Spice Girls, don't see this movie.  If you do like the Girls, you should like the movie for what it is.",Null,1,1,22 February 2003
Batman Returns," Bring Back the Bat
","Remember when Michael Keaton was Bruce Wayne? Remember when Tim Burton was directing Batman movies? Remember when the Batman franchise was making more money than any other superhero? Those were the days.'Batman Returns' is a brilliant, dark comedy/adventure from the mastermind of Burton. I mean, the original 'Batman' (1989) is still my favorite movie of all time, but 'Batman Returns' definitely doesn't suck.The story is very good, the set is amazing and the villains are great!In fact, I know that I may sound sexist by saying this, but since most comic book collectors are guys, I can review this movie in four words that should make you to get out of your recliner, brush the potato chip crumbs off your 'The Truth is Out There' t-shirt, put on some pants and run to your nearest Blockwood Video store to rent 'Batman Returns'. Those four words are: MICHELLE PFEIFFER IS CATWOMAN! And ladies, to show that I'm an equal opportunity reviewer, I'll say, in a very non-sexual way, that Michael Keaton really looks great in that Batman outfit.Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go watch the Catwoman scenes in slow motion.",9,0,0,19 September 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Put On The Boxing Gloves!
","I've had it with all these, quote, 'Star Wars fans', unquote, that claim that this is the worst movie they have ever seen.  I thought that title belonged to 'The Phantom Menace'?  They both can't be the worst movie of ALL TIME! Decide right now between one or the other, and stick with your choice, you pompous popcorn eating, Citizen Kane loving 'critic' scum! 
George Lucas has done nothing but entertain our lives and all you can do is say how the acting was so 'wooden' that you can't stand it!!!  He cut back on Jar Jar, what else do you want?  You'll never be satisfied!! Heck, why don't we just take George and the rest of the cast and do a good old fashioned witch burning!!!!!!  I mean, after all, this is the guy who brought us 'Howard the Duck'.Do me a favor.  Watch 'Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope' and tell me that the acting in that movie is the best you've ever seen!!!!  Harrison Ford wasn't at the top of his acting skills! Carrie Fisher didn't win an Academy Award for her performance!  I'm not even going to mention the suckiness of Mark Hamil. (Okay so I just did.)If you hate these movies so bad...don't go see them!  It's as simple as that!  I've stopped watching Pauly Shore films due to the fact that everytime he speaks, I want to step on a small animal.  I hate his movies, yet I don't go online and tell the world how bad I hate his movies...until now, that is.The point is, it's obviously cool to not like a movie that's supposed to be the coolest movie out there.  So now we have a bunch of know-it-all 'critics' telling us that this is the worst movie that they have ever seen!!!  Did you ever see 'Manos: Hands of Fate'?  Now, that's the worst movie ever made.  Period.Do me a favor, please don't see 'Episode III'.  You don't deserve it!Now that's off my chest, let me just say that I thoroughly loved (GASP!) 'Attack of the Clones!'From the fight scenes to the love scenes, it was everything I expected and more!  It's too bad that many of you went to see this movie just to how you could critique it, because you sure missed one of the best movies that you'll ever see!I give it ***** (that's FIVE!) and I'm waiting with antipation for Episode III.  Long Live Star Wars!",Null,0,0,18 May 2002
Grease," A Million Spoilers!!!
","Okay, if you've never seen 'Grease', you really have to ask yourself, 'Why am I surfing on a movie database when I obviously don't watch movies?' 'Grease' is one of those movies, like 'Wizard of Oz', 'Sound of Music' and 'Star Wars' that everyone should have to watch before they watch really any other movies.  They should even show them in schools, just as long as they show it before the kids realize what 'Grease Lightning' is really about.Totally off subject, but do you remember seeing this film as a youngster and loving it, and then you decide to watch it when you turn 16 with a group of friends, and you were shocked about some of the things they say & do?Anyway, back to this review.  'Grease' is my favorite musical. (FYI: 'Little Shop of Horrors' is a very close second place.)  The Top Ten Reasons why I Think GREASE is the Best Musical:10. Grease 2: If it weren't for the popularity of 'Grease', we wouldn't have 'Grease 2' and I probably wouldn't know who Michelle Pfeiffer is.9.  The T-Birds: When I was asked what I wanted to be when I grew up, my three usual answers were 'Jedi Knight', 'Pittsburgh Steeler' or 'T-Bird'.8. Olivia Newton-John7. Pink Ladies: As the T-Birds were to me, millions of girls made Pink Lady jackets and wear them every Halloween.6. Grease Lightning: Who wouldn't want a car like this that promises the stuff it promised?5. Sandy Olsen is HOT!4. Music: From Frankie Valli singing the theme song, to Sha-Na-Na performing cover tunes, the soundtrack is one of the best.3. Lorenzo Lamas: Before he was a 'renegade', Lorenzo was Tom Chisum, the ultimate jock who's 'brains are in his biceps.'2. Danny Zuko: John Travolta was ten times cooler as Danny Zuko than he was as Tony Manero in 'Saturday Night Fever' and Vincent Vega in 'Pulp Fiction' combined.And, of course, the number one reason why I love 'Grease'... ...Olivia Newton-John as Sandy Olsen: Olivia is the only woman I'd leave my wife for, especially when she's wearing the cheerleading outfit.  I know, a lot of guys will say her black outfit at the end is the selling point, but it's the whole innocent factor that I love this woman.Anyway, there you have it.  A totally unbiased review of the greatest musical of our time.  Any questions?",Null,2,3,6 April 2002
Edward Scissorhands," What Else Can I Say?
","First of all, let me say that this is the 100th review for this movie, unless some other jerk is writing their review right now too, but that's doubtful.Out of those reviews, the majority being positive, you can find out everything you'd like to know about this movie. Some stuff you may not want to know.Having said that, let me state that 'Edward Scissorhands' is one of the greatest movies that you will see. The set is stunning! The script is original, with a sort of revisited feel at the same time. Does that make sense? The actors are incredible! Tim Burton is a genius!If you haven't seen 'Edward Scissorhands', do yourself a favor and rent this movie. Be reminded that it is a Tim Burton film, and his films tend to get a little eclectic (which I love), but under all the 'weirdness' there's an adorable story that needed to be told.",10,0,0,4 June 2002
Spider-Man," WOW!
","I'm a Super Hero freak!  Most of my possessions have a Hero symbol on it...and I'm thirty years old, for crying out loud.I've been waiting along with the rest of the universe for Spider-Man to finally be produced and hit theaters, and I was lucky enough to get a sneak preview last night.  HOLY COW!  What an amazing movie.When I first heard Tobey Maguire was portraying Peter Parker, I thought...'Yeah, right!'  Boy was I wrong.The actors were incredible, with especially noteworthy performances by Maguire, J.K. Simmons and especially Willem Dafoe.  In fact, there's a mirror scene (no, it's not a spoiler) that I believe is one of the greatest acting scenes in movie history.  Incredible!Go see this movie!  It definitely lived up to it's hype.",Null,0,0,1 May 2002
The Little Mermaid," Worthy of The 'Disney' Name
","NOTE: The following is the opinion of a very tired person at work.  He has a horrible head cold and has been 'doped up' on Nyquil for three days now. Please keep all of these things in mind while reading this review.I love Disney films.  I always have.  When I was a kid, my family used to go to every Disney film when it was released.  I was in awe of the animation and the songs. Even now as I watch the Disney Classics over & over & over again with my daughters, I still think they are some of the best movies ever made...even after watching them five times in one day, like my daughters like to do at times.But, sad to say, during the 1980's, Disney released some movies that I would not even try to call 'Classics'.  Movies like 'Fox & The Hound', 'The Black Couldron' and 'The Great Mouse Detective' had some redeeming moments, and I still feel are decent movies, but they lacked most of the things I expected from a Disney movie.Then there was 'Oliver & Company'.  To be totally honest with you, the only reason I even saw 'Oliver & Company' is because Billy Joel's voice was in it.  That's it!  I still enjoyed it, but did it deserve to wear the Disney name?  Not in my opinion.Along comes one of the greatest years of my life...1989. I'm a Senior in High School, a 'Batman' movie had been released earlier that Summer and I happened to be playing Orin Scrivello, the Dentist in the school musical 'Little Shop of Horrors'.  We hear that Howard Ashman, the man who wrote the music for 'Little Shop of Horrors' wrote the songs for Disney's 'The Little Mermaid', so we decide to go see it for that reason alone. When I left the movie theater on a cold winter night in December 1989, I realized that the Disney that I grew up loving was back in a big way.  'The Little Mermaid' had everything I have grown to love about Disney films.  A princess, beautiful colors, singing and dancing animals and a really evil villain.  I loved it!'The Little Mermaid' is my favorite Disney film and ranked in my personal Top Ten of All-Time Movies.  It was the beginning of a bunch of Classic Disney films that are worthy of wearing the Disney name.FUN FACT: The song 'Part of Your World' is very similar to the 'Little Shop of Horrors' song 'Somewhere That's Green'.  When you see 'The Little Mermaid' with most of the cast from 'Little Shop', you catch things like this.",Null,0,0,4 January 2003
Ghostbusters," I Love This Show
","Unless someone is reviewing this movie at this exact moment, this should be the 200th review of Ghostbusters.I hate to sound like my father, but they just don't make them like they used to.I watched Ghostbusters again last night (I watched the commentary on the DVD, but I have the dialogue memorized, so it's almost like watching the movie) and I can't help but laugh out loud at this movie. Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis are hilarious, Rick Moranis is classic, and Sigorney Weaver proved that she could do comedy long before 'Galaxy Quest'.The dialogue is great, with some fabulous ad-libbed stuff from the actors. The special effects are not the greatest compared to today's computer-generated stuff, but I think it adds a sort of comic feel to the movie that deserves to be there.Forget about the then-overplayed theme song. Forget about the 'He Slimed Me' and 'Back Off Man' t-shirts. Forget about the not-so-great sequel.If you haven't seen this movie for awhile, go rent it and I'm sure you will laugh.",Null,0,0,20 September 2003
Moulin Rouge!," Did I Really Like This?
","Let me start by saying that I can't stand Baz Luhrmann.  From his headache inducing take on 'Romeo & Juliet' to his 'Everybody Needs Sunscreen' song that was played on the radio every two minutes.  The guy has a different view of the world that I never wanted to visit again.My wife finally asked me to rent 'Moulin Rouge' because she really wanted to see it, and I refused to see it in theaters.  I gave in, and in the first five minutes, I thought I was going to go do something productive with my time, like staring at my shadow, when suddenly I realized I was hooked on this movie.Was it the music?  Was it the costumes? Was it the fact that a Jedi Knight was singing?  The answer is YES!!!!!!!I took Drama class for six years in school, and I'm telling you right now, I would've loved to do a musical like this in school. Instead we did 'Mame'! 
The first thing people will tell you about this movie is the music.  If I were Elton John (which I'm not), I would definitely be proud of the way 'Your Song' was arranged.  In fact, most of the songs in this movie are just fun to listen to.  There is a warning on this, by the way.  If you watch this movie & love the music, you'll want to go out and buy the soundtrack. If you want 'Lady Marmalade', get soundtrack #1.  If you want anything else, soundtrack 2 is for you.Anyway, Moulin Rouge is a lot of fun, but I'll tell you it's extremely bizarre!  It's not for everyone.  Then again, there are people who don't like 'Star Wars'.",Null,0,1,6 April 2002
The Godfather: Part III," Not Like I & II...and that's the problem
","I've read most of the reviews for 'The Godfather Part III' and for those of you who hated this movie, I have something to make you think about. 
Pretend that this movie was released with a totally different name, like 'Mobsters Inc.'  Could you honestly say that it was the worst movie you've ever seen and just plain dull?The reason it was such a disappointing show was because it contained the word 'Godfather' in the title, so we all assumed that this would be another Oscar-winning movie like it's predecessors.'Part III' is not a bad show in any sense of the word.  It's a great story. It has great acting.  It's just not a 'Godfather'.If you go into this movie thinking that way, I'm sure you'll enjoy it.",Null,1,2,18 December 2002
Die Hard," It Barely Gets Better Than This (Spoilers Possible)
","Reason number 354 why I dislike Osama Bin Laden...We'll never see 'Die Hard' on the big screen for it's 20th Anniversary. That is, unless they take out all the guns via computer like E.T., but then what would be the point?FYI: Let me just say that I'm comparing Die Hard to all other 'Action' movies, meaning guys with guns and loud explosions.  I don't include any Indiana Jones movies in the 'Action' category.  They are considered 'Adventure' movies to me.  Okay, having said that...Die Hard is the greatest Action movie ever made! Period! Pass the potatoes!I'm waiting for all of you Stallone/Schwartzneggar/Segal/Chan/Li fans to argue this point with me.  You won't win!If you haven't seen Die Hard, stop reading this review right now and go to your nearest dvd/video sales merchant and buy a copy.  Trust me, you'll want this movie in collection once you've seen it.  Go ahead.  We'll wait for you.Die Hard is the ultimate buddy cop movie, even though the cops weren't really working side by side.  Every buddy cop movie from 'Turner & Hooch' to 'Rush Hour' has yet to match the chemistry between John McClane and Al Powell.Not only did Die Hard make Bruce Willis & Reginald VelJohnson (who played a COP in Family Matters) stars, it also introduced most of the world to Alan Rickman, one of the finest actors of our time.  Very few people has the range of Rickman (Robin Hood, Galaxy Quest, Harry Potter) and he's the ultimate bad guy.Die Hard is just a full fledged action film that other actors and directors will copy, but never equal.",Null,1,1,30 March 2002
Back to the Future Part II," Not As Good As The First...
","...but I still love it!This is the 100th review for this movie.  Actually this is a review for the entire Trilogy, but I decided to put it under Part II for two reasons.1) Most people HATE this movie, so it'll be nice to actually read a nice review here.2) I wanted to be the 100th reviewer.Back To The Future (BTTF) is one of my favorite movies of all-time.  I admit, it may have to do with the fact that I grew up in the 80's and this movie epidomizes the 80's: skateboards, Deloreans, Michael J. Fox, the casual use of '1985', etc.  It may have to do with the fact that I thought 'George McFly' was one of the greatest characters in history.  Maybe it's just that I had a crush on Lea Thompson.  For these reasons and more, I loved the entire BTTF Trilogy.I won't go into the details of each movie, but I'll tell you why I like Part II.Yes, Part II was a little choppy, but I think it needed to be told the way it was told.  ***MINOR SPOILERS*** There had to be proof, as they talked about in the original, that whatever you do in the past could mess up the outcome of future events.  So the whole going back to 1955 was an integral part of the trilogy, because, really that is where all the time travel stemmed to in the beginning.  I don't know if that makes sense, but just trust me on this one. ***END OF SPOILERS***Besides Michel J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd, the rest of the cast (Crispin Glover, Lea Thompson, Thomas F. Wilson, etc.) were all great.  I try to watch this entire trilogy at least once every six months, and I just enjoy all three movies thoroughly.I admit, I enjoy the original and Part III more than I enjoy Part II, but I can't say I hate Part II, like a lot of people (including my wife).Now that it's on DVD, there should be no reason for you to buy this movie.P.S. While you're watching Part II, watch closely in the part where Marty goes into the 80's cafe and plays the video game.  One of the kids is Elijah 'Frodo' Wood.",Null,0,0,25 January 2003
The Emperor's New Groove," Funny Stuff
","I'll be totally honest with you. The previews for this movie did nothing for me. I just figured it was another movie in the continuing decay of the Disney masterminds, so I never took my kids to see it, nor did I plan to ever own this movie. Last week, I saw the DVD on sale and thought, 'What the heck! I might as well give more money to the Disney Corporation.'I'm so glad I did.'Groove' is definitely not your parents' Disney film, and that can be a good thing. I laughed out loud so many times at this movie (the first time a Disney film has made me guffaw since 'Alladin'). David Spade is perfect as Kuzco. Former Catwoman Eartha Kitt plays the villain in a beautiful way, and her sidekick, Kronk, played by Patrick 'Puddy' Warburton, is my favorite character in the movie. His Devil & Angel conversations are hilarious.My daughters have now watched this movie about 56 times in the past week (NOT an exaggerated number) and I still giggle uncontrollably when I hear him humming his own theme music. (See the movie and that last sentence will make sense.)'Groove' is not the typical 'classic' that you expect from Disney, but it is worth owning, and keeps you laughing throughout.",Null,0,1,3 June 2003
Signs," Forget What You've Read
","If you've ever read any of my reviews, you know that I have a very eclectic taste in movies.  You also know that I hate these 'reviewers' who can't find anything good in a movie because it was made sometime after 1962.  Not to mention those that feel the only good director has the initials Stanley Kubrick and every other director just copies his style.These people can't go to a movie like 'Signs' without picking it apart because it 'copied' other movies.  It sure didn't stop you from liking 'Gladiator'.  Face it, there are very few new ideas out there anymore, so just because a movie like 'Signs' reminds you of 'E.T.' or 'Star Trek' or 'Killer Klowns From Outer Space' doesn't mean SQUAT!!!!!!!!I feel better now.  Having said that, and putting my life in peril from Kubrick fans, let me say 'Signs' is another masterpiece from M. Night Shyamalan...ranking up there with 'Sixth Sense' 'Unbreakable' and 'Wide Awake'.  (I'm lying about 'Wide Awake'.)You know the story, so I won't go into details, but I will say the part of this movie that scares you is the unseen factor...a la 'Blair Witch Project'.This movie is funny, touching and intense.  It messes with all of your emotions, sometimes at the same time...just like 'Ernest Saves Christmas', 'Poltergeist' and 'Sorority Babes in the Slimeball Bowl-O-Rama'.In all seriousness, 'Signs' is a fantastic movie.  The actors were incredible...Leaf 'Joaquin' Phoenix really surprised me in this movie.  I was laughing pretty hard at some of his lines.  I will tell you that this movie is not action packed, but then again, besides 'Wide Awake', which M. Night movie has been action packed?  Go see it and decide for yourself. ('Signs' not 'Wide Awake'.)p.s. I think Kubrick is a genius.  There has never been a director, nor will there ever be a director that could rank up there with him.  He's the Johnny Mathis of movie directors.  Vaya Con Kubrick!",Null,0,1,5 August 2002
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Fred Krueger, Mom
","They say that when Norman Bates killed Marion Crane in the shower, people stopped showering.  When I first saw Freddy Krueger, I stopped sleeping.Elm Street was an incredible movie that reinvented the slasher genre.  It still amazes me when I watch it.  It's too bad that Freddy had to become this pun-spewing killer, because when you watch the original Elm Street he is so eerie, it just sticks with you for days.I think one of the most amazing things about Elm Street is the acting. Usually, in a film like this, the actors do a good enough job for the teenagers who are watching this film, but really if you watch Elm Street, Heather Langenkamp's 'Nancy' is genuinely scared of Freddy Krueger.  I still get chills when I hear those words, 'Whatever you do, DON'T FALL ASLEEP!' It doesn't get much creapier than that.Plus, I think the theme ranks right up there in the classic Horror themes...not to mention 'One, Two Freddy's coming for you...'In conclusion, please trust me when I say to forget everything you know about Freddy Krueger and watch the original again...or for the first time. It's a classic movie that everyone involved should be proud of.",Null,0,0,30 March 2002
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A Classic Movie
","I am one of those fans of the 'Star Wars' movies that continues to enjoy the 'prequels'.  I know that our numbers are dwindling, but I still stick by my reviews of 'Phantom Menace' and 'Attack of the Clones'.  (Click my name to see those other reviews)At the same time, I can't help but watch those two movies and think that Lucas did more in the original trilogy with little sets and little toy spaceships than he has done with computer systems.Even while watching the 'Special Edition' original Trilogy, I think Lucas messed up putting all that new computer generated effects in it.  The movies were basically perfect, why mess with them?I hope that Lucas follows the example of Disney with 'Beauty & The Beast' or Spielberg with 'E.T.', in the sense that when I purchase the original Trilogy on DVD in 2006 or so, I have the choice to watch the original releases or the special editions.  I doubt that will happen, but I keep my hopes up just in case.I was five when 'Star Wars' came out.  I am not a big 'Sci-Fi' fan.  Never have been, but there was something extremely special about this movie.  Yes, I contribute some of it to the special effects.  I contribute some of it to Han Solo and Darth Vader.  I even contribute some of it to my crush on Princess Leia, but I think the real reason that I, along with millions of other fans in the world, absolutely love this film is because we had never seen anything like it before 1977.By the way, don't give me that ''Star Trek' was on TV blah blah blah cannot even match the talent blah blah sang 'Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds' blah' bull.  I'm aware of the Sci-Fi TV shows and movies that we had prior to 1977, and I still stand by my statement.  There was nothing like 'Star Wars' and to be honest with you, there really has been nothing like it since.It is a movie that deserves to include the word 'Classic' in every review given about it.",Null,0,0,4 January 2003
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," A Classic Movie Quoted By Idiots
","NOTE: There will probably be some 'spoilers' in the review.  The way I see it, this movie was made in 1975, so if you really wanted to see it, you would have already.  If you haven't seen it, I'm sure you've been bombarded with re-tellings of this Epic more than you care to.  What I tell you here will be nothing new.'Monty Python & the Holy Grail' is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.  I remember seeing this for the first time when I was about seven.  As most people, I thought the Black Knight scene was hilarious!  It is truly one of the greatest scenes since the tornado scene in 'Wizard of Oz'. 
I went around, at the age of 7, saying stuff like 'It's just a flesh wound.' My brother and I would reenact parts of this movie over and over again, until my mom finally told us that we'd be grounded if we ever yelled 'NI' again.  That was the end of my 'Holy Grail' quoting days.This movie is a classic. As far as comedies go, it doesn't get better than this.  I'll pit this movie against anything that stars Jim Carey or Adam Sandler.Now having said that...don't you think it's time that we quit quoting  this movie already.  When you're seven, it's acceptable to say stuff like 'You don't frighten us, English pig dogs.', but when you're thirty and trying to tell someone who hasn't seen this movie about the coconuts used for horses, it just isn't funny.  Like I said before, if someone hasn't seen this movie already, they either don't want to see it, or they just celebrated their first birthday.  Either way, we don't need to tell everyone how funny it is when the rabbit attacks the knights.  Without seeing it, they just won't get it.  Please, I beg of you, don't quote this movie anymore.For those of you who went to Plymouth Elementary School, I apologize for over-quoting this movie.  Please don't avoid this movie because of my stupidity, or the stupidity of all the other 'Holy Grail' fans.",Null,0,1,22 June 2002
Gladiator," I Don't Get It
","What a dud of a movie! Don't get me wrong. This movie had some amazing scenes, but I didn't think Russell Crowe's performance was anything spectacular (he was much better in 'The Insider', and should've won best actor for that, but that's another story.) The story was too predictable. We've seen this epic type movie many times over, and quite frankly, it's hard to come up with new material...I understand that. But to totally rip off scenes from it's predecesors...what's up with that? I guess this movie just ranks up there with all of the other over-hyped movies (Titanic, There's Something About Mary, ANYTHING starring Julia Roberts!) To be honest, I thought that Gladiator was almost boring. There was not enough action to keep the movie rolling.As for Best Picture? I know that the Academy loves the epic, but there were a few movies in 2000 that deserved the awards more than Gladiator. (Almost Famous, Traffic, Crouching Tiger...) Overall, I guess I just expected more from this movie. I guess I just have friends who hype movies too much. Maybe I should tell them to shut up.",4,0,1,11 July 2001
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Just Another Review
","As I write this, there are 580 different reviews about 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?'. Most of them seem to be positive. Even though I feel I must make my voice clear on how I feel about this movie, I figure you've already made up your mind on whether you're going to watch this movie or not.Let me say, WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!!I guess I should've started this review by telling you that I was a 'Bandwagon Jumper' when it came to this movie. I've never been a George Clooney fan, and I don't think I could ever forgive him for what he did to the 'Batman' franchise (Val Kilmer also), so when this movie hit theaters, I avoided it like the plague.Even after all of my friends told me that I 'had' to see this movie, I blew it off by telling them that I had a hair appointment...even though my head is totally shaved. The more they raved about it, the more I didn't want to see it.Finally, after I rented almost every other movie at Blockwood video, I had the choice in renting 'Chairman of the Board' starring Carrot Top or 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?' Even Clooney beats Carrot Top.I got home and popped some popcorn, poured myself a tall cold glass of Dr. Pepper and prepared to be let down from an over-hyped movie.After the first fifteen minutes or so, I realized that it didn't really suck. After the first half hour, I found myself laughing out loud. After the credits were rolling, I found myself running to the store to purchase a copy.Yes, the music was a big selling point for me, but George Clooney was extremely good, even Oscar good (in my opinion). Needless to say, I tell everyone how great this movie is and how much I love George Clooney...I still don't forgive him for 'Batman' though.I hate people like me. Bandwagon Jumpers!!!!!",Null,2,3,2 November 2002
