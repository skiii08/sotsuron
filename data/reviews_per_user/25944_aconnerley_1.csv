The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," my opinion on Part 1
","While I agree with some people's opinions that this movie was by far the best in the series; I don't agree that there is no reason to see the Part 2 of this last book. If you have read the books, you will understand the reason for the second part. If you read the books you should also know that the second part has more excitement than the first. I don't know that I would watch Part 1 again because the movie cut a lot out of the movie that was in the book, particularly scenes and information with the Quileute Wolves. Part 1 did have some touching scenes but some scenes were poorly executed; again this deals with the Wolves. The voice over sounded like cartoon voices. I think it would have been better if they would have used the actors' real voices instead of altering them.",9,3,11,19 November 2011
