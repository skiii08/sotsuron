Angels & Demons," Don't waste your time if you had read the book !
","I wouldn't say it was a good movie, but to be fair Tom Hanks as usual delivered a great performance although the script was so short and simplified in comparison with the book, not to mention that all the characters were out of depth and as a watcher I couldn't connect with any of them, as they were so poorly introduced, only the main character Robert Langdon was interesting since we know much about him if we assume that the audience have watched The Da Vinci Code.I gave it (4.6 out of 10) for its visuals and how amazing Vatican city was shot, other than that the story seemed weak and rushed to an underwhelming ending..",5,0,1,21 October 2016
