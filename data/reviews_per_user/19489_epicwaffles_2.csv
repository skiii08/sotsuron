Hereditary," Horrific perfection at its finest!
","This film is exactly what all other horror films aspire to be. It is a true rarity these days, finding a horror film that not only terrifies you, but intrigues you. A film that scares you enough to stop watching, but keeps you interested enough to play it through. My #1 Horror recommendation! (#2 being Get Out, and 3 being the Pet Cemetary remake)",10,3,7,20 July 2019
Black Mass," A frightening look into the murderous life of Whitey Bulger
","Played by Johnny Depp, Whitey Bulger (mob boss and FBI informant) was truely a legitimate badass in the world of crime. Murderer, extortionist, arms trafficker, and FBI informant... An intriguing combination with many almost unbelievable true stories on all fronts. A 10/10 Crime film, and a true masterpiece with Johnny Depp's dissapearance into the roll. Flawlessly executed, and written in truth, this is a MUST SEE MOVIE!",10,1,2,20 July 2019
