Ali," good not great
","Overall Michael Mann's choppy direction and a wandering script really hold back what could have been a great movie. Mann is obsessed with the music of the time period and while at times it does create a nice atmosphere, he also extends several scenes to unneeded length because of it. The script goes into great detail in certain areas of Ali's life, yet leaves other areas strangely glossed over. For instance, a great deal of time is spent on his father, whereas almost none is spent on the relationship between Ali and Joe Frazier, who many consider to be his greatest enemy, most interesting foil, and Ali's greatest triumph, yet the Thrilla in Manilla is not even mentioned.In the end, it works to a certain extent thanks to a wide range of excellent performances including, Jamie Fox, Jada Pinkett Smith, Ron Silver, Mykelti Williamson, Jeffrey Wright, and especially Jon Voight and Mario Van Peebles. The last two portray historic figures in their own right and give them the proper scope those men deserved, while still being deferential to Ali. Finally, Will Smith gives the finest performance of his career to date and continues to grow as an actor as he impersonates Ali perfectly while creating a flawed, but larger than life man who becomes a legend.",7,1,2,29 June 2008
The Longest Yard," Terrible Movie
","The Longest Yard was a movie with great potential. It had two of the hottest comedians around in Sandler and Rock, a recognizable name for the older crowd in Burt Reynolds, an excellent villain in James Cromwell(watch LA Confidential if you don't believe me), and finally it was based off of a pretty good original (which starred Burt Reynolds). Despite all this the sum of the parts was disappointing. Here is why.The plot holes are enormous. Sandler does not look anything like a football player for obvious reasons of stature. The scene where the guards try to pick a fight with Nelly is ridiculous because when he doesn't fight back the guards don't do anything. Earlier in the movie Sandler is beaten up by the guards without picking a fight and they were looking to injure Nelly. They didn't want to injure Sandler.Many of the jokes were way overused and stale. Cheeseburger Eddie was not funny at all and his putting a burger on Rock's grave was almost insulting. The male cheerleaders in drag was not very funny the FIRST time they showed them. By the end of the movie the cheerleaders had been on the screen for at least 10 minutes. The football player on estrogen was funny however. But only for the first few times. They just kept showing it and showing it. Keeping with the overuse theme, the use of the slow-motion technique. The first time with Nelly running was cool. After that is was boring. I think that movie would have been another 10 minutes shorter if that was taken out.Finally the script was just bad. It gave Rock nothing to sink his teeth into. Sandler looked like he was bored half the time. And many scenes were just not needed (the secretary who has the hots for Sandler, the Brucie character's on again of again relationship with the lead male cheerleader).I will admit i laughed at some scenes. The cameo by Rob Schneider was funny. The whole scene leading up to Sandler's arrest was funny. I also enjoyed the cameos by the football players and announcers. Irvin and Chris Berman especially. But it just wasn't enough to save the movie. I'm saying this as a big fan of both Sandler and Rock. I love Waterboy and Happy Gilmore, but The Longest Yard is nowhere near up to the standards of those two.",3,0,2,9 June 2005
U-571," Action-packed
","One heck of a movie if you take it for what it is. U-571 is a submarine thriller about a crew who takes over a German U-Boat and then is stranded on it. The movie explains it better than I do and it is fairly believable for the most part. The movie even adds a little character study of it's main character(played by Matthew McConaughey). Not much though. This film's purpose is keeping you on the edge of your seat and it succeeds to the fullest. It has great special effects, decent acting, and is not dragged down in the slightest by its script or plot. If you want to have a thoroughly enjoyable movie watching experience then rent U-571.",8,1,3,16 May 2005
American Beauty," Pure Genius
","Every so often a movie comes along that totally changes the way people define a good movie. Usually its an action flick, like the Matrix, that uses some new camera work combined with stunning visuals and everyone calls it a masterpiece. This movie, American Beauty, is truly a work of art. Every frame, every line carefully crafted by rookie director Sam Mendes. There are no battle scenes, no technology. It is just a family in suburbia.This movie should affect everyone who sees it because it is true for us all. American Beauty is actually a social satire of suburban America. These people have an image of what they are 'supposed' to be implanted in their brains. One day Lester (Kevin Spacey), snaps out of it. Lester realizes there is more out there than a dead end job, a wife who bosses him around and is obsessed with material possessions, but more importantly Lester realizes there is more in him. As Lester starts to change himself, it also affects his environment. His wife Carolyn (Annette Benning) is totally thrown off keel by his actions. Lester has discovered that they are not the average middle class suburban family but a completely unique group of human beings. When he tries to get this message across to Carolyn, she rejects him, has an affair, and convinces herself she is the victim. Lester and Carolyn's message and the main message of the movie is that we all wear masks, put up facades. And unless we become ourselves, we can never truly be happy. It is said multiple times in the film that it would be terrible to be ordinary.Now, there is a second message. A parallel story is being told. That of Lester's daughter Jane and her boyfriend Ricky. While these two stories are deeply intertwined and connect with each other, Ricky and Jane's message is equally important. Ricky lives in a world of beauty. Beauty is everywhere and in everything. Jane, who at the beginning of the film believes she is ordinary and plain, is brought into this world by Ricky and is shown how much she has to offer. Their message is that there is beauty in everything and all you have to do is look for it.To make a film of such deep content, it takes a skilled cast and crew to come across as not preachy. Director Sam Mendes (Road to Perdition) has a long and successful career ahead of him. He was able to draw such subtle performances from a magnificent cast and then tie it all together with a tremendous score by Thomas Newman. Alan Ball, another fairly new name, gives a screen play with such audacity, wit, and deeper meaning its almost scary. And of course any review of American Beauty would not be complete without mentioning Kevin Spacey. Before I saw this movie I didn't think it could get much better than his role as Verbal Kint in the Usual Suspects. He was better in American Beauty. This is a tremendous actor in the role of a lifetime. This is one of the finest cinematic achievements I've ever witnessed, and there wasn't one explosion.",10,6,11,15 July 2005
The Usual Suspects," My favorite movie
","This is in my opinion, the best movie ever made. Where to start? Acting? Kevin Spacey gives his best performance ever and the Oscar he received is more than deserved. Gabriel Bryne is terrific as Keaton. The rest of the cast is all very solid, especially Stephen Baldwin and Chazz Palmintieri. Del Toro and Pollak are also very good. Then there is the script and plot. Both build very well. They leave little hints without giving anything away. To completely understand this movie you have to watch it several times before you get everything. And of course the final scene is among the best ever. Director Brian Singer has really impressed me. He brought a certain style to this movie that is also evident in his X-Men movies (some of the better comic book adaptations). John Ottman gets kudos for his fantastic score. And everyone else who was involved in the making of this breath taking movie. This is a must see for everyone who doesn't mind a little violence and likes a movie with good twists.",10,0,3,17 May 2005
War of the Worlds," Great until the end
","I went into this movie with great anticipation and was not let down throughout all but the final three minutes of the movie. Yes there were a couple of plot holes, but overall it was incredible. The score was excellent, Cruise was very good, Dakota Fanning has a big career ahead of her if she keeps acting like this. But above all this Spielberg was in his element. He kept it tense, fast-paced, enough character development to keep it interesting, but not so much as to bore us. He never bothered to question man's existence or anything like that. He was just taking us on a no expense spared thrill ride. I had no idea what would happen next for most of the movie. This had some of the most fantastic camera work, unbelievable effects. All in all i was having a heck of a time. Then they killed the final Alien and walked up that Boston street to find....... the mother and the son both alive. Not only that but they happened to be looking out into the street right as Cruise comes walking up it. After doing about as good a job as a director of a disaster picture can do in avoiding clich√©s, Spielberg unloaded a giant dumpster of them on the audience in the final minutes. If it had been just Cruise and Fanning, Cruise would have had to become the father he had already started to change into, Fanning would grow to trust him and they would rebuild their life as civilization rebuilds. THat would have been a far superior ending and I would have given this at least a 9 out of 10 without hesitation. But the complete breakdown of holding off Hollywood, even though it only occurred in the final seconds was very disappointing. In any case its still worth seeing, especially on a big screen.",7,1,4,30 June 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," A thoroughly enjoyable movie going experience
","I was nervous as I sat down in the theater on opening night. Nervous that this Episode would be as lame as the one before it. After the catastrophe that was episode 2, I had begun to lose faith in George Lucas. How wrong I was. This is by far the best film of the newest trilogy. It is a long movie but it doesn't feel like it. The script is decent, the acting, while still wooden at times, is vastly improved (especially by Hayden Christensen). The action scenes are breath taking and John Williams is tremendous as always, but that wasn't what made this film. The high point for me was the way it lined up so perfectly with the original trilogy. Every little detail was arranged so neatly. Lucas even brought in James Earl Jones to be the voice of Vader once Anakin's transformation is complete. All in all it is a very enjoyable movie that is good for almost all ages.",6,2,4,19 May 2005
Cinderella Man," Howard works his magic.
","Alright lets get the bad things out of the way first. It was very predictable and it started out a little slow. All done.Now heres the good part, everything else. However, while everyone involved with this did a terrific job, there is one man who deserves special mention. Ron Howard. He did an amazing job really making the audience care about Braddock (Crowe). Despite the fact that I knew exactly what was going to happen Howard manipulated me to where I was in fear of Braddock's life and on the edge of my seat throughout the entire final fight. Kudos must go to the entire cast, especially the scene stealing Craig Bierko, and everyone else who was involved with this film, but as of right now Howard has my vote for the Oscar.",8,0,0,16 June 2005
