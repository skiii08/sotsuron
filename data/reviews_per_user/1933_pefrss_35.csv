Black Swan," Ugly Duckling
","While standing in line to buy my ticket for 'Black Swan' I joked with the lady behind me that hopefully not all of the kids standing in line are going to see 'Black Swan' and she responded that she did not think so and that she heard it was a rather gruesome movie. And I agreed ' Yeah, ballet is a tough business'.Nothing had prepared me for a slasher movie. I had not read a lot about the movie, only that it was about ballet and artsy and as I love ballet, it was a given for me that I would go and see it. I loved 'the Company' and 'Les uns et les autres' and bought both of them on DVD after I saw the movie. If I would have known that I am walking in some kind of horror movie I would have saved my money and bought myself a good DVD instead .Well back to Black Swan , the ballet part was not worth the entrance fee. Portman was never shown dancing only waving her arms and close-ups of her starving face. For a movie about ballet there was not a lot of dancing going on. The horror part I did not watch because I find it disgusting and I am getting so tired of lesbian sex. Obviously trying out lesbian sex is fashionable but this scene was not erotic or arousing and what other purpose has a scene like this but to arouse people? Unfortunately I stayed until the end in the hope that I would understand what the director was trying to convey. But I should have left the theater the first time I turned away from the screen.I do not understand the positive reviews.",1,19,36,9 January 2011
The Monuments Men," Grow up Clooney, this was no joking matter
","I deleted my first review when I realized that I was a victim of propaganda and wrong information and that the movie with its shallow entertainment value had lulled me into believing that it was actually entertaining. But as an artist the subject was too important to me and I revisited the documentary 'The rape of Europe' and read everything else I could find about the Monuments, Fine Arts & Archives-Section (MFA&A) and the people involved to refresh my memory and as I did so, the more dissatisfied I became with the movie. First of all the primary goal of the organization was to protect historical buildings from the bombardment of the Allies. As reality and the movie showed the Monument Men were not very successful to convince the military men not to bomb irreplaceable buildings in Italy or Germany. Just think of Leonardo da Vinci's painting in the monastery near Milan which miraculously survived the bombardment and the Campodisanto in Pisa, which is still being restored nearly seventy years later. but many of the frescos which date back to 1300 are lost forever. Not to speak about Germany where entire cities with all their beautiful buildings were flattened. . The other goal of the organization was to make sure that cultural treasures would not be looted by the victors, as it had been a tradition in any war since ever. The art historians realized that many soldiers had no idea about the value of art or furniture and would use it to build fires to keep themselves warm. The wonderful idea of the MFA&A was to think that even if the government of a country commits unspeakable acts, that the people of this country are still entitled to their cultural heritage and that it is an important part of rebuilding a country to leave the cultural heritage in that country.. Another misrepresentation in the movie is that it gives the impression that all the art they found in the mines and castles were stolen by the Nazis. In reality Germany had her own program to protect the art and the museums themselves made sure that the art was transported into safe locations like mines and private homes for preservation. So for example the salt mine in Merkers. Everything stored there was stored by mostly Berlin museums to protect it from bombardment. Obviously the conditions in a salt mine are favorable for art . None of it was stolen by Nazis and the German museum people knew exactly where it was and would have recuperated it after the war and put it back in the museums. In the last decade or so there were a few movies made about the Nazi time which were really thoughtful and do not paint a black and white picture, i.e. Americans or Allies all good, Germans all bad. Clooney made a cheap movie in the sense that he did not pay homage to the real achievement of the Monument men but instead plays the usual game of portraying the Americans as the good guys, conveniently he kills off the British and French Monument men early in the movie and does not mention that altogether there were over 300 people from different countries involved. He gives the impression that it was an all American venture.The character Cate Blanchett plays had a real important role in finding a lot of the art, but in his movie she is more or less reduced to a love interest for Matt Damon. I went to see a few of Clooney's movies because I was interested in the subject matters he chooses and nearly always I was disappointed. He picks good subjects but does not deliver. His movies have no depth, most of them are forgettable. I also do not think that he can act. He always plays himself and while joking with his friends is okay when he goes on the talk show circuit, this movie was not the right forum for pranks. In the documentary The Rape of Europe one of the professors in Austria deliberates what would have happened if the Viennese art school would not have rejected Hitler twice. Maybe we would live in a different world today. Maybe Hitler would have learned to appreciate modern art and would not have destroyed it as degenerate. Who knows?The question if art is worth to endanger you life to save it, is a personal question. It is for me, I would never go to war because my government decides to fight another country because the representatives are financed by the armament industry, but I would participate in a mission to save art even if it is dangerous.",3,12,18,18 February 2014
Marie Antoinette," Lost it
","When this movie was in the theaters I did not see it. The reviews I read were too bad to spend several dollars on it. And that was a difficult decision for me because I like historical films and I liked 'Lost in Translation' very much. Recently I fished the movie out of a bargain bin for one dollar and watched it at home. Well, I tried to watch it. After the second levee I switched to the special features and watched Father Coppola tell us that he advised his daughter to treat this film like a big Marie Antoinette party where everybody is invited to show up in costumes. That may explain some of it. But I do not like to watch parties. Especially one where everybody but me is high on marijuana and is completely self-absorbed and I am left out. I suffered through some parties in Hollywood which were exactly like this.Obviously Sophia Coppola, the costume designer and the pastry chef went gaga and spent most of the forty million production costs on costumes and cakes. So there was no money left for script, acting, actors, music or anything which usually makes a movie. And as the one who watches the movie they did not let me eat cake nor wear costumes. I also read that this movie was planned before 'Lost in Translation' was made and only because Sophia had difficulties figuring it out, she wrote and made Lost in Translation first. I really hope that Lost in Translation was not a one hit wonder. It seems nearly unconceivable that this director can turn out such a sensitive movie like Lost in Translation and then directs a complete and utterly piece of fluff like this one.Only because of all her connections in Hollywood she got an Oscar for costumes, because otherwise there is no justification for it, there must be a movie attached to the costumes, there wasn't. And what about that Jewish Dauphin?, only reading through the comments here I learned that she is related to him. If I would not have seen Lost in Translation I would have dismissed the whole thing as daddy bought his daughter a forty million toy. Now I wait and see what she will do next.",1,1,1,31 January 2013
Gravity," Spaced out on a regular screen
","Years ago I used to work in tourism and visited Houston and Cape Canaveral quite often and never missed the see the IMAX space movie there. This was the main reason why I went to see Gravity because I was hoping to see beautiful images from space again. Unfortunately I made the wrong decision to see the movie not in 3D. Though the images were still quite beautiful but not so spectacular as I remembered them from the NASA films. Every movie I had seen so far in 3D left me always dissatisfied, but after reading the comments it might have been a better idea to see Gravity in 3D and I considered to go and see it again in 3D. On the other hand I could live without seeing the story again and listening to the dialog. Clooney played himself in a space suit and Bullock was hyperventilating most of the time.Space debris is certainly a very important subject to tackle and the more satellites we are sending into space, the bigger the problem gets. So in this aspect the movie was realistic. I cannot judge how many mistakes were made scientifically, but some of the stuff just did not seem probable. I could not understand why Clooney was drifting off into space....Obviously the character of Bullock was not sufficiently trained to go on a mission like that and I wondered if that could happen in reality. I was also frustrated that she was not only ill-prepared and panicky, but also howling like a dog and most of the time half-naked. Come on Hollywood,can a female scientist not be competent and dressed? I understand that S. Bullock is considered to be America's sweetheart for some reason, but I have never seen a performance from her which impressed me. I also have to admit that I have seen her only in reruns on TV, I never bought a ticket before to see her in a movie theater. Correction, I just remembered that I saw her in 'Time to kill' the movie adaption of John Grisham's best novel and I thought that she was completely miscast in that movie. Nothing in her performance brought the Grisham character to life for me. After just seeing Cate Blanchett with an incredible performance in Blue Jasmine, directed by Woody Allen, and carrying the movie with ease, I can only say that S. Bullock was completely and totally miscast in this movie. This movie asked for a real strong actress and that she is certainly not.So I would recommend the movie for the visuals (obviously in 3D would be better)and not for the story or the acting (Clooney being himself is not really acting). I am a little bit disappointed with the director,Alfonso Cuarón, whose movies I usually love, but nobody delivers every time. And now I am determined to see one the NASA IMAX movies again. images from space are so intoxicating, you certainly do not need a whining, half-naked, hyperventilating Sandra Bullock in the forefront.",3,1,5,11 October 2013
Inglourious Basterds," Applauding to violence
","I usually avoid movies with violence. I went to see this film because I speak French and German and I was curious about the angle of the Jews getting revenge.What a disappointment! If revenge is being as cruel as the Nazis, what is the point. Half of the movie I could not watch because of all the blood and violence. Human beings should come up with better solutions. After all we should by now be a little bit more sophisticated than the primitive men who clubbed each other over the head. But obviously not. There was constant laughter and applause for the violent scenes in this movie. I am ashamed for my fellow human beings.I gave the movie three points because of the fact that the dialogue was in the original languages and some of the acting was good. I regret having spent the money on that film.",3,44,100,24 August 2009
Argo," Not even worth a nomination, let alone an award
","I never saw Argo when it was in the movie theaters. Mainly because i think that Ben Affleck is a lousy actor and also because I read a lot of reviews telling me that the story was inaccurate. Well, I finally saw the movie on a slow afternoon at a friend's house without paying for it. Thanks for that. Because it certainly is not worth to pay for and it is not even worth the time . First of all I fell asleep several times while watching the movie and had to start it over and over again. So much for suspense. I am so tired of movies depicting Americans as the saviors of this world. I am so tired of American movies showing the people of other countries as bad and dangerous and inferior. Maybe the Hollywood movie people should remember that the US is a melting pot of people from all over the world and there is nobody living in this country, who did not come from somewhere else originally. I will never understand how this movie got nominated and won Academy awards. Actually that is not true, I understand that these awards are bought and obviously that year the gang around Ben Affleck spent enough money to win the price. I also understand that even IMDb is a forum where people vote and review just to promote a movie because they are paid for it. So whatever rating we see on this movie is not really representative of people who actually paid for seeing the movie. Well, I did not pay either and I am so glad I didn't.",1,5,8,23 March 2014
Brokeback Mountain," What's love got to do with it?
","In the meantime I have become really cautious to view any movie which has been hyped a lot.Nearly every time I regret having spend the money and time.Unfortunately I do like movies and the pickings got so slim. So I decided to see Brokeback Mountain, despite that the reviews made me suspicious.I love Canada. The scenery shots were worth the admission price. No regrets there.I am female without homosexual love experiences. I could relate to the sex scenes in-between the two men, I could not relate to the fact that they were supposed to love each other. It is easy to keep up sexual tension if you meet only from time to time in a recreational atmosphere. It has nothing to do with a love which has to survive the daily grind.The story told in this movie(I have not read the book) is not a love story, the story told is about a love affair drawn out over twenty years, hurting a lot of people on the way. In many of the reviews I read a regret. A regret of not having had the courage to live a love. But if these two would have lived their love consequently, the story would probably have been even more depressing.I left the theater a little bit frustrated. Frustrated because I had not seen the moving love story I expected, but an all too familiar tale of human shortcomings, well portrayed.",2,17,33,4 January 2006
Spotlight," I have no faith that priests can live without sex
","This is a well made, well acted movie. Worth while seeing. Reading the reviews there is one review which claims that the story was really broken by Kirsten Lombardi working for an alternative Boston paper called Phoenix. She does not get any credit in this movie. I have found often that these alternative papers dig out a good story and because they do not have the resources of big newspapers are not able to follow up the same way. Nowadays there is not much money for investigative journalism anywhere. Everything is owned by a few corporations who impose their agenda on the news staff, which is very sad and worry-some. This movie also shows that journalists embedded in a community may not question thoroughly those which have been their friends since childhood and who may threaten their survival in that community. It sometimes takes an outsider to force the spotlight on things. That became evident in the journalist played by Michael Keaton. First I suspected that he might have been molested himself, but then it turned out that he had ignored the story twenty years prior though it was served to him on a platter. In this respect the movie was well rounded and realistic. It is also realistic about the abuse children had to suffer by priests. I was raised Catholic, I never encountered an abusive priest during my childhood. But there were plenty of indications that priests were suspected to have sex. With their housekeeper or with devoted church ladies. I remember people making jokes about it and finding it okay. In my personal opinion I consider it abuse that the Catholic church forces priests and nuns to live a sexless life. It is against nature and obviously nature takes revenge. If priests and nuns could marry the Catholic church would probably not have such a huge shortage of people willing to serve. I have left the Catholic church the moment I legally could. As a woman I saw no role models and no place for me. I looked at all the other religions in this world and decided that none of them appeals to me. Religion may be a comfort to some people, but it also seems to be the breeding ground for so much hate and so much violence. So for decades I have lived happily without religion or faith. A strange thing happened to me and a few dozen of other movie go-ers while trying to see the movie. We were informed by the theater management that they could not show the movie because they did not have permission. We were refunded and offered to see other movies instead. This was a first for me in decades of movie going. I ended up seeing this movie in a different theater run by a different company, they obviously had permission",10,4,8,21 November 2015
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Booooooooooring
","Friends talked me into seeing this movie. I had not seen the first two and my only connection to Pirates of the Caribbean consisted in multiple visits to Disneyland and Disneyworld. I had not read any reviews or story lines. I slept off and on through the whole movie. It was long and boring and I could not understand anything what was going on. From the beginning to the end, I stayed clueless what the story was about.The special effects, costumes or masks did not impress me. The magic was definitely missing.Another proof not to see anything, which is a box office success and has been hyped . Even the poor employees of my grocery store had to dress up as pirates to sell tickets.",1,9,14,28 May 2007
Midnight in Paris," Escaping the present
","Lately it looks like I am only watching one movie a year in the movie theatre and that is the one Woody Allen puts out. Especially the American movie industry seems to be determined to produce only movies I am not interested in. I have never been a big fan of Paris, so I did not see the movie for the city unlike the movie Vicky, Christina Barcelona, which I mainly went to see because of Barcelona. But I have always loved period films and like everybody else I dream about having been born at a different time and place, ignoring of course the problems of times passed.Midnight in Paris transports you back in time to show you only the positive side: the greatest artists, the most beautiful women in wonderful clothes, delightful music and joie de vivre in a beautiful city. So sit back and enjoy the ride. This is what movies are supposed to do. Transport you to another time and place and let you forget the present for the time of the movie. Plus you do not forget the movie immediately because the thought behind it stays with you.Bravo, Woody Allen. And this must be one of the most beautiful movie posters.",10,1,5,12 June 2011
The Hateful Eight," A theater play where the blood drips into audience
","This year I decided to see the popular most talked about movies though I knew in advance that I would not like some of them. The Hateful Eight falls in the category I normally would not see. I do not think that the fans of this kind of movie are really appreciating the fact that it is a theater play with endless dialogue. And while I like dialogue, in this movie it did not fit. It is hard to imagine that these kind of people spend hours talking I hate guns and I hate violence and vile language, and the last place where I would enjoy myself is in the emergency room of a hospital where one shot victim after the other is brought in, so for me it is pure punishment to sit through something like this. I am not opposed to recreate history even if it is painful to watch and I thought that Private Ryan did a good job showing and not glorifying war. But this movie did not recreate the Civil War for me.After suffering through two gore fests :the Hateful Eight and the Revenant ,I am convinced that the only purpose of these blood orgies is to attract people who love cruelty or are mentally underdeveloped and there seem to be plenty of them. Not that the showings I attended were sold out, far from it. None of the actors was convincing because the whole thing was unbelievable, it was not a western and it was not a theater play. It was just an awful orgy of violence, blood and bad language. I left the theater and needed a big bubble bath to wash off all the memory of it. Not that it helped. Never again.",1,55,110,18 January 2016
American Sniper," Killing machine made into a hero
","I was very reluctant to see this movie, but then decided that I should see it because it is so popular. I liked some of Eastwood movies and did not like this one. It was just one killing after the other.I did not pay for it. Thanks for that. I did not enjoy the movie, I do not enjoy watching people killing other people. I did not enjoy the implication that this war was okay and what the US did over there was okay. There are these millions of Nazi films showing how effective the German military was. Does that make it right?Should we glorify certain Nazis because they were good at what they were doing?Obviously Clint Eastwood as director and Bradley Cooper as producer and star knew exactly which trigger points to use to get the average non-thinking American to get into the movie theater and like this movie.. While we are now dealing with thousands mental and bodily cripples in this country due to this war , this guy obviously got over his killing spree without problems. The number of disabled veterans has jumped by 25 percent since 2001 _ to 2.9 million _ and the cause really is no mystery. And as we are hearing in the news a lot of the Veterans seeking help get ignored by the authorities. While the companies who were working as non military support in these wars made a killing financially. I would have applauded this movie if it would have shown much more how the life of these soldiers who signed up for these wars, was destroyed by it. How the life of the soldier's families got ruined by killed or disabled family members who served. There was no reason for this war in the first place and we all have to live with the consequences for the next decades. This is why so many veterans commit suicide, this is why we have veterans running amok with PTSD or just drop out of regular life. In former wars like the WWs for example, everybody had to serve and when they came back all of them had the same experience. In these wars with the voluntary army you have a few who have to carry the burden and are deployed over and over again until they are mentally or bodily destroyed. Military is brainwashing. Brainwashing somebody to become a killing machine without thinking. Just following orders. Will that ever stop?",1,5,33,25 February 2015
The Revenant," Unbelievable bloody gore fest. I did not watch most of the time
","Yeah, a Hollywood actor can survive the mauling by a huge bear. Can survive being buried half-dead in freezing temperatures. Can survive alone and half dead and wounded in freezing temperatures without food and weapons, swimming in freezing cold water, surviving in wet clothes in freezing temperatures . Miraculously this Hollywood actor can suddenly run when necessary while he limped just a second ago. Though finally arriving at a safe spot still half dead , he is immediately able to go out again and fight his enemy. Half of the movie I closed my eyes because I had no desire to watch the gore fest, the beautiful scenery with stolen Ansel Adams images did not make up for the rest. I should have followed my initial instinct. After watching a preview I thought that this was not a movie for me and I was right. Never again will I fall for the hype. Unbelievable.. Disgusting blood orgy.",1,21,41,16 January 2016
Silver Linings Playbook," Dancing with PTSD
","Dancing with PTSDThe Hollywood solution to mental problems. And WOW about everybody in this movie has mental problems. And that is probably the only thing I found realistic in this film.The rest is so filled with clichés. First of all the two lead characters are super good looking. What else do you expect? We cannot have average looking people afflicted with bipolar or depressive disorders, can we?And while in the real world people who have been diagnosed with bipolar and have been committed to a mental institution have a hard time to keep friends, the guy in this movie still has the support from everybody,but his ex-wife and her lover. Another astounding thing is that a lot of the main characters are out of work and seem to exist without problems. The answer may be that the father (De Niro) has turned bookie after losing his job. And I have to admit that I know so little about betting that the whole segment about the bet eluded me. I also have never been to a football stadium or watched a game (I guess, it was football) and after seeing the scenes at the stadium I certainly never will. Now we get to the part where dancing becomes the therapy. While I completely agree that physical activity is very important in coping with mental challenges, I seriously doubt that somebody without any dance experience can enter a competition, again, I am not familiar with these kind of competitions, but after what they showed it was not a segment of 'So you think you can dance', where anybody gets a go. The dance scenes reminded me of that unfortunately also Oscar nominated movie 'Black Swan' where the camera only showed the dancer waving her arms because she obviously was not a trained ballet dancer, and in this movie the dance scenes are so chopped that you get no idea what the girl wanted to achieve with her choreography. And then of course we have the typical Hollywood ending . Everybody is happy and boy gets girl, and daddy wins his bet and gets his diner and they live happily ever after screaming at each other. Because as Dr. Phil always likes to point out , you can always judge a person by his past behavior. I have no idea why this movie got all the nominations, but that is not the first time, that I am clueless.",2,41,67,23 January 2013
Dallas Buyers Club," An unlikely hero
","I resisted seeing this movie because I avoid homophobic , constantly swearing rednecks in real life and had no desire to watch one on the big screen either. . On the other hand I lived through the second half of the eighties as a newly divorced woman scared to enter any sexual relationship because of that new STD, which nobody really knew for sure how it was transmitted. So I was curious to see how the film portrayed that time. In the late eighties I visited San Francisco on a regular basis for at least a few days every month due to my work. So I saw quite a few of these emaciated skeletons trying to survive and I remember well the stories about the non-existent drugs or much too expensive drugs. I also remember the fear in the Hollywood community after Rock Hudson died. People were afraid of kissing or even filming with actors who might be homosexual.I have a few issues with the movie. It was a little bit unbelievable to me that this guy who lived in a trailer became suddenly a world traveling successful businessman while being at the brink of death. I do not think that in reality somebody so ill could bring up so much energy and become such a well informed person, especially considering that this was before the Internet and research was much more difficult . I also read that the real Woodruf was bisexual and married and his initial diagnosis was not thirty days only. Hollywood always feels that reality is not worth while portraying. I also did not buy that the female doctor would fall for the guy. That said I have to say that I was especially moved by the performance of Jared Leto . He succeeded in portraying the desperation somebody who is going to die must feel. I also liked the performance of McConaughey, but I just did not believe that somebody like him exists. In the thirty years since the Aids crisis exploded, attitude has changed and of course knowledge about the subject. We should always remember things like that when we form an opinion about anything. In my lifetime so many attitudes have changed and what was unacceptable is now at least tolerated if not embraced like for example gay marriage.",7,0,1,20 February 2014
The Lives of Others," Surveyed to death
","There were many reasons for me to see this movie.Some of my relatives lived in East Germany and could not get out. I never visited them before the wall fell, but as it was my mother's sister, Mom went to visit her sister on a regular basis over the years. She came back telling strange tales, that her sister and her husband were afraid to talk politics in their own house and always signaled to my mother to shut up. Nobody trusted anybody and parents were even afraid of their children, because the children were so indoctrinated by the regime. The older East-German generation suffered under and hated the all-present surveillance , but the younger ones were believers in the system. The reunification of the two Germanys brought a lot of problems and many of the former East Germans missed parts of their old way of life because it took care of them. Some good movies have been made to illustrate what life was like under the communist rule. One of my favorite is 'Goodbye Lenin', which is hilariously funny and deeply sad at the same time.I saw 'The lives of others' at the first matinée when it opened in my town. The theater was half full , which was unusual for a foreign language film at such an early hour. Usually five people would be a high number.All through the movie fear kept creeping up in me. Are we not there too? Are we not being surveyed everywhere and at all times? Wherever we go ,there are surveillance cameras. In the streets, in the shops, at work, at banks, in parking lots, even at home. They keep records of every move we do. They can trace practically all our financial expenditures, they know what we eat, where we shop, what we buy, how often we return or exchange items. They issue us all these plastic cards, which record everything we do. They know our medical history, our relationships, our criminal records and every move we make on the Internet, or who we contact on the phone. And that is without anybody taking a specific interest in us. Well, the interest is mostly to get to us to spend money. We are only of interest as long as we are consumers. Because our system is based on consumerism and has to be preserved. Now another interest is terrorism and we are even more under scrutiny.The East German surveillance was based on preservation of their control system. They needed to keep control, because otherwise people could find out, that the system was not so good and they might revolt or leave the country. Like in our system, only a few people really profited from the system, the others were paying the price. The movie makes the case for artists paying the price of not being able to make art anymore. Many did not want to live that way and ended their own lives. East Germany stopped counting the suicides, because there were too many. The movie's main theme is about that fact.I see suicide broader. There are many forms of slow suicides. Drugs, alcohol, overeating, mind numbing . 'I see dead people everywhere', but mine have still living bodies, but the soul is gone or was never developed. We should all ask ourselves the question: Are we fully alive? Or are we just vegetating? Has our system turned us in brave little consumers without any other purpose in life?Are we still caring and compassionate people or are we so indoctrinated by our system of consumerism that we judge people only by credit rating, status and material accumulations?I hope, the fact, that the movie received an Oscar, will bring a big audience in the theaters. East Germany is not so far from the U.S. today.",10,8,13,3 March 2007
Room," Room with no view but full of great performances and love
","Saw Room finally. Saw it because it had Oscar nominations and did not really read about it before I went to see it. So I was lost watching it first. I tried to understand why this woman and the child were so poor and lived in a room which was bedroom, bathroom and kitchen and living room and never seemed to go out. Slowly it dawned on me that they were held captive by Old Nick and that the child had never seen the outside world, but knew television and some books and stories told by his mother. I was fascinated. Somehow the film succeeded in making me identify with every character in that movie. I tried to imagine what I would have done or thought if I would have been the mother, the child, Old Nick, the grandmother and grandfather, the partner of the grandmother . I loved the movie. I loved the performances. I loved how it make me think and feel and imagine living in a world reduced to a room . I loved the art the two captives were creating and the love they had for each other. Some people obviously find this movie boring, I was captivated from beginning to end. Awestruck really.",10,0,3,9 March 2016
Ex Machina," Deus Ex Machina- A closet full of custom made women
","I happened to be the only woman in that afternoon showing of this movie I attended. I am a big fan of dystopian literature and films and happened to catch one critic's recommendation for Ex Machina though I had not heard anything else about the movie otherwise. Maybe women do not dream about creating the perfect man, at least I have not seen or read about it, women resign to reality.. But starting with Stepford wives there seems to be a constant stream of artificial women being created by men who do not want to deal with reality. In this case one single billionaire,Nathan,search engine owner, living in a beautiful remote bunker adorned with priceless artwork and the most beautiful nature surrounding him, created himself a closet full of beautiful women robots of all colors. To test how well the artificial intelligence he gave his creations works, he invites one of his employee, Caleb, to stay with him for one week and asks him to evaluate his robot Ava, i.e. Eva the first woman. Obviously Nathan extracted the personal preferences of Caleb from the search engine and created the ideal woman for him and subsequently Caleb falls for the robot and tries to escape with it. To see how that ends you have to see the movie.I enjoyed the movie. Good acting. An absolute unique setting and a good script. I would just go back and see the movie again to see that stunning Pollock painting and I wonder if one of the paintings was a Gustav Klimt. I am sure it was a coincidence that I happened to be the only woman in that showing, on the other hand which woman wants to watch how she is being replaced by a robot?",8,1,5,28 April 2015
The Imitation Game," A Bite from the Poisoned Apple
","This year's choice of Oscar nominated movies left me pretty unwilling to go to the movie theater. Reading the reviews on IMDb turned me even more off and some movies I may consider seeing are still not in the theaters where I live. But I felt like going to the movies again so I decided to give the Imitation Game a try, mainly because I grew up in an environment of scientists. My father was about the age of the mathematicians in this movie and he worked during and after WWII in an institute of research in Europe for the defense department. Everything the physicists, engineers and mathematicians did was top secret and only many years later did I learn what they were working on, so the movie was familiar to me in many ways.. Movie scripts which are based on true stories and then decide to change the facts in order to appeal to their more simple minded viewers, have never been my favorites. I could not get myself to go and see the movie the Theory of Everything about Stephen Hawking because I read that it is mainly a relationship story and I was more interested in his work. And I am a woman and not a scientist. I felt a little bit the same in this movie because too much emphasis was put on the fact that Turing was gay. Of course I thought it was very important to point out that at that time in history homosexuals were prosecuted no matter where they lived. So there is no need to feel superior there over the Nazis. Afterwards I read that the only female mathematician in the film was wrongly represented because she was obviously already working as a mathematician at Bletchley Park before Turing even got there, which was quite rare at that time and should not have been muddied by acting like she was just some girl doing cross words.. I sometimes watch the TV series the Big Bang Theory and am amused about their portrayal of scientists. Well, that is supposed to be a comedy and while they got some traits of scientists right, they are over exaggerating like crazy by portraying them all as bumbling idiots when it comes to social graces. In the many years I have known scientists in the circle of friends of my parents, I have met no bumbling idiots. Most of them were extremely sophisticated and well informed people, who were able to hold their own in any social setting. I just cannot imagine any of them having temper tantrums like was shown in the Imitation Game . It looked to me like a continuation of the school years,which i also found exaggerated and I would have been happy without the whole school segment. I cannot remember any bullying at school when I grew up , it looks to me that this is a more modern thingI also cannot imagine that a bunch of scientists can make any military decisions like it was implied in this movie. When they showed the scene where supposedly the brother of one of the scientists was on a convoy which was going to be bombed in twenty minutes, and they were debating if they should save his life, they lost me. They also lost me when they never showed any male love interest of Turing. If there was so much emphasis put on the fact that he was a homosexual why not show him having a homosexual affair? I can understand that homosexuals at that time would enter pretend marriages, but after what I read now about Turing he had homosexual affairs quite openly.. As I learned after watching the movie it was also not true that they were the only ones to break the code. Iam getting so tired of this endless portrayal of the Germans as Uebermenschen, though of course it was amazing how such a small country could win so many battles in WWII. Compare that to the huge military force of the US losing one war after the other, it is quite impressive. I am not saying that it was a bad film, but I did not find it so spellbinding and fascinating as many other reviewers did. I would have preferred if they would have concentrated more on the process of finding the solution and the excitement of making new discoveries in science. We need more scientists and I do not think that portraying them as social outcasts helps. The most fascinating thing I read browsing through the other reviews was that Steve Job used the bitten apple symbol because of the cyanide laced apple Turing used for suicide. If that is true, that would be quite something.",6,2,9,24 January 2015
The Da Vinci Code," I was not prepared for cheesy
","I liked the book. Being a recovering catholic, I enjoyed looking at the Jesus story in a different way. I was looking forward to the movie, mainly because of the great locations the story unfolds in.I also imagined the book being good movie material. When I read all the bad reviews, I told myself that most of the times good reviews are wrong. And how often did I end up seeing a movie because of some approving film critic and found the film disappointing and walked out of the theater convinced that this critic has been bought by the studio.Heck, I wanted to see the movie, so I went to a matinée. There is a lot of things I do not understand . Does nobody looks at the movie after it is finished to see that certain things are not working? And maybe changes it then. Why does the main character always has to be a big star? I have nothing against Tom Hanks, but he did not convince me at all in that role. And why make a movie about the feminine power suppressed by the church and make the main female character weaker than it is written in the book? And there may be a lot of things which are wrong with the book, but it is an interesting read and it is certainly not cheesy. Especially at the end the movie was so cheesy that it made me gag.And it was boring. There is no excuse for that movie to be boring. And I do not mind long. It is a complicated story to tell. But long and boring? I wanted to see the movie on the big screen. I like the big screen and there are movies which I saw in the theater and then bought the DVD and they had not the same impact on me at home. And why is the whole movie so gloomy and dark? This is not a gloomy and dark story. It is an exciting and colorful story. I regret that this movie is going to make so much money. It does not deserve it. After I came home from the movie I watched part of Oprah Winfrey's Legends Ball and she claimed that Jesus was there. Maybe she is a descendant of Jesus and Magdalena? Who knows?",1,14,29,22 May 2006
In Time," Brainless future or brainless writers?
","Before the movie starts, they show an ad now in my local movie theater suggesting that it is so much better to see a movie on a big screen, than on a small TV at home and I agree. Unfortunately I do not want to see explosions, car crashes and chases or gory mutilations. While I used to go to the movies all the time, I am lucky if I find four or five movies a year I want to see.I just want to join the chorus of the people who went to see the movie because they liked the idea behind it and came out disappointed. I am a big fan of Aldous Huxley's 'Brave, New World' where he created a world of perfect young people who would not age and would die at a predetermined age. In his book the class system is solved by sleep schooling people into being happy with the place in life they have been assigned. The age idea brought me into the movie; the change of currency from money to time did not seem to make such a big difference to me. And I thought that the age idea was the only thing well done in the movie. The rest did not convince me. This was to be some kind of future? It looked more retro. Like always I was disturbed by the obligatory need for car chases and extensive use of guns. Can nobody envision a future less violent? And the time currency was so unprotected, that it was just unthinkable that people would not constantly rob each other all the time of time. Is there nobody in Hollywood to produce something a little bit more intelligent? Are they just counting on getting certain uncritical young people into the movies, who want to see certain stars. Apropos stars, I was happy to see Johnny Galecki {Big Bang Theory) in a small role, he should get bigger roles in movies. He is an excellent actor.",4,2,6,13 December 2011
The Departed," Never again
","From time to time I watch a movie, because I trust the good reviews and also because I think, I should watch not always the same kind of movies. Usually I avoid violent movies.What shall I say? That I was wrong to trust the good reviews? That I have no idea,what is going on in the world? If anything, what was portrayed in this movie, is going on in the real world, we are really doomed. I thought, the Iraq disaster was bad enough. But obviously the members of police departments are a bunch of corrupt, constantly swearing, murdering thugs, every citizen should avoid to have any contact with. Commenter before me have pointed out the many improbably scenarios. But if any of this should be based on real events, I will look as quickly as possible to emigrate to another country.",3,2,7,16 February 2007
Zero Dark Thirty," The whole audience was spellbound
","I usually avoid crowds when I go to the movies, that is why I always go to early afternoon showings. So I was very surprised when I found the big theater packed to nearly the last seat when I entered it right on time for the previews. A lot of good reviews have been written about this movie, so I do not have to go into details. I can only say that everybody in the theater was spellbound from the first to the last moment and anybody who wrote that this is a boring movie must have seen something else. I gave it an excellent as I found nothing wrong with this movie and I will go and see it again because it is so well made. And I will also see the Hurt Locker now, which I have not seen so far, this director seems to be excellent. I hope she wins.",10,10,25,11 January 2013
War of the Worlds," Cruising disaster
","I do not like Tom Cruise. I do not care much about action movies. I admired some of Spielberg's movies. I love to go to the movies but this year there is so little choice that I decided to see the War of the Worlds, especially because I had heard so much about the Orson Welles radio show. Can I please have my money back? Mr. Spielberg you are a wealthy man, six dollar fifty for an afternoon ticket was way too much money to watch that piece of junk. Nothing made sense in this movie. The relationship of the divorced couple and the children. The people watching the earth break open without running. Most cars not driving, but of course the one of Tom Cruise. Cameras not working, but the TV crew could take pictures and a camcorder still working. The crashed airplane which did not touch the Cruise car and the drive-away-path. On the boat the family ends up in the water - it is obviously winter and ice-cold - but they happily walk in their wet clothes for miles - which must have dried miraculously. The whole way people interacted in face of a catastrophe. The end of the movie.Could I please became an actor and make millions - I can scream and I can look wide-eyed frightened. I can also run and jump on furniture. I could also write screen-plays which make no sense at all. How stupid have people become that they give a movie like this good reviews - especially journalists? Unfortunately I read a good review and decided to see the movie. Of course Spielberg is entitled to make a bad movie. But so bad? With all these resources. I was not impressed by anything. None of the action scenes, none of the actors, none of the alien devices. At the end of the movie somebody in the theater tried to clap and was met with deafening silence. If Hollywood continues to produce such inferior crap, I continue to watch good foreign movie I can get my hands on.",1,5,11,7 July 2005
The Wolf of Wall Street," This must be the most misogynist , vile movie in a long time
","When the Wolf of Wall Street was in the movie theaters I read the reviews and decided that I did not need to see it. Recently I developed an interest in seeing more movies with Jean Dujardin in it after I saw a movie called Moebius . I had also seen The Artist, but nothing else with him. So I searched on IMDb which other movies Jean Dujardin had made and found that he had a part in the Wolf. I took the Wolf of Wall Street out at the library (thanks for that, so at least I did not have to pay for that trash) and when I started to watch it I remembered why I did not want to see the movie in the first place. I have to admit that I fast forwarded through it because there is a limit of how many times I want to hear the f word, or watch a bad dye job on Di Caprio or see unsexy naked prostitutes. I get that Scorsese want ed to paint the guy as repulsive and he was successful in doing so, but three hours of repulsive without anything interesting happening is just too much. It also reminded me never to wear anything from famous designers again because that would put me in the company of sleaze balls. When I see movies like this the only fear I have is that some young stupid impressionable person may actually think that this kind of life is a good thing. Otherwise I can only recommend this movie to women, You will never want to be with a man who drinks or takes drugs again after watching that and you will never trust your man going on a business trip again. I live in Las Vegas and I have heard from people working in the big hotels that they have to take the hose to some rooms which have been used by immature drunk males on drugs, but I highly doubt that any airline would allow their customers to behave like these pigs. I did not need to see this movie to know that this kind of men are lousy lovers and husbands. There was really nothing I liked and again I realize that this was the intention. . It was no fun to watch, I have not learned anything new. I thought that DiCaprio was too old for the role and the hair and eyebrow dye job was so distracting that I was always waiting to see the color drip. The movie left me completely and totally depressed, it is so demeaning to women and so so sad that Scorsese and DiCaprio thought that this is the right way to make money. Actuall I cannot really remember a movie from Scorsese or DiCapria I really enjoyed, so maybe I should never watch one again either one has anything to do with.",1,3,5,9 February 2015
Inception," Boring nightmares of a disturbed person
","I am beating myself up because I fell for the hype. Unfortunately I spend money on that nightmare, next time I go to a movie which has been so hyped I make sure it is a free screening. It is a nightmare. If you have these kinds of dreams you are a deeply disturbed person. Shooting, car crashes, explosions, shootings, car crashes, explosions that is all that troubled soul dreams about. I usually do not go to movies consisting of shootings, explosions, car crashes and crumbling buildings. Only when I really feel that a movie gives a realistic rendering of war will I go and see such a movie because I am trying to understand that part of human nature. But I went. It was hot and I thought it would be nice to sit in a cool movie theater. Well first the movie theater was warm and I had to fight to stay awake , then they switched the air-conditioning on high and we all got frozen. I was hanging in checking my watch every three minutes and hoping that eventually I would see that great movie people were raving about. Nothing. After 148 painful and boring minutes I tried to getup and leave but was frozen stiff and it took me a few seconds to get moving. The credits had just started rolling but the movie theater was already empty, obviously everybody could not wait to leave. There were only a few people anyway in the afternoon show. This was my first movie in eight months because there was absolutely nothing worthwhile seeing in the theaters nearby. I love to go to the movies and I love the big screen so when the ticket lady asked me if I wanted XP I said yes. I was disappointed by that too. Not worth the money. Hopefully there will some movie I want to see in the coming months, otherwise I will stick to books.",1,35,69,23 July 2010
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," This was my first Star Wars movie and there was no awakening for me
","There is a movie theater in town where seniors can see movies for four dollars before four p.m. I take advantage of that if there is a movie I am interested in. Today I decided to give the Star Wars movie a shot if it would not be too crowded. It wasn't. I cannot recall if I ever saw one of the movies in this series before. If, it was not in a movie theater and it did not have my full attention. Of course it was impossible over the decades not to know some of the characters and I was intrigued because Joseph Campbell, who I admired, thought that the Star War movies were outstanding. He was a friend of George Lucas. Well, I may have to get the DVDs of the old Star War movies to judge that, but this movie was not outstanding.If you are not familiar with the whole thing, you are lost and I was. So my impression of the movie was the following: These white armors. the soldiers on one side, are wearing are completely useless. They could as well wear sweatshirt as far as protection goes. There is an incredible amount of shooting and explosions in this movie, if I would have known that, I would have saved my four dollars, I hate movies with a lot of shooting and explosions and as I thought that this is mainly a movie for children, I did not expect so much violence..Harrison Ford looks his age. As I have not seen the previous movies, I did not really understand who he was and what he stood for. Obviously he is too old for the franchise now , so they killed him off. This film has been promoted on every single show from early in the morning until late at night and so I happened to see one show where Lupita Nyong'o was introduced as a member of the cast. I have to admit that I did not see her. Maybe she was wearing a mask?I saw a lot of merchandising stuff. Not that I ever bought anything related to a movie, but I thought that little round robot was cute. Is that available as a toy?I guess this movie is only meant for people who are already fans. It certainly did not gain a fan in me. Actually I was bored and disappointed. At the end it felt like a boring TV series with a cliff hanger trying to keep you hooked. . By far the most interesting thing in the theater was my neighbor who seemed to masturbate all through the movie, maybe he also thought that the movie was not exciting enough.",1,110,191,18 December 2015
Munich," I never checked my watch more often
","I lived in Munich in 1972, so I wanted to see this movie. I understand that the movie is only loosely based on actual events and the rest is based on a fictional book. I understand that Spielberg wanted to give us a message that violence against violence will create more violence.But did he have to make that movie so boring? I do not like to see violent movies but in some instances it may be necessary to make a point. But I see no point in showing a bleeding completely naked woman as long as possible, but for some sick gratification. I also found the copulation scene at the end a step in the wrong artistic direction. There was really nothing in the movie which could hold my attention. And I should have been fascinated because I practically knew every location they showed. Maybe Spielberg should think about retiring? I heard that no attempt was made by Spielberg or Kushner to contact anybody who was actually involved in Israel. Why make a movie and use on one side actual material and then make no attempt to try to portray the truth and facts? At least this movie did not get much attention at the Oscar nods.",1,74,121,3 February 2006
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Please silence your cellphone now, or.....
","I used to like the old James Bond movies, which were so over the top, but humorous at the same time. Usually I avoid all movies with a lot of violence in it and only went to see the Kingsman because I saw an interview with Colin Firth and just could not imagine him as an action star and wanted to see it for myself.I have to say I laughed through the whole film. It was impossible for me to take the fight scenes seriously, they were so exaggerated that it reminded me of fight scenes in Asterix and Obelix, the only comic books I ever read. I liked the dystopian message of the film. Control through the little electronic device nobody is able to be without anymore. I can imagine that some corporation will give people free phones and internet access in order to watch their every move and control them. We are nearly there anyway.I thought the sets were impressive and the acting great, no surprise there with that cast.. Good entertaining movie. Much more people in our movie theater than in 50 shades of Grey next door, by the way. No surprise there either.",8,2,9,13 February 2015
Spectre," World travel with James Bond
","This is the first James Bond film I have seen with Craig in it. I liked some of the old classics, but did not think that Bond brand should continue forever. I saw this one because I read somewhere that there was some spectacular scenes from a 'Day of the dead'parade in Mexico in it. And I was not disappointed, just these scenes alone were worth the price of admission for me. I have to admit that I hate to watch violence, so I spent quite some time in the movie not watching. But I also laughed on several occasions, some of the Bond brand is so retro and it took me back a few decades. I enjoyed the trip around the world and was entertained, but for the fight scenes. Obviously they cannot come up with new ideas to improve the Aston Martin, so this time the car was mainly good for a long and sometimes spectacular chase. Spectacular were also the helicopter stunts. I like Craig, but in my mind Sean Connery will always be 007.",8,26,49,16 November 2015
Her," Nightmare or Dream: From online dating to dating your computer
","I can still remember vividly the time when the first online dating sites appeared and everybody was excited about the immense potential of new mates you could find on the Internet. I went into this movie primarily because Joaquin Phoenix is one of my favorite actors and I will see any film he is in. I did not read much about the film beforehand and therefore was not really aware of the fact that the movie played in the future. So I found myself wondering if there is really an operating system who would allow you to do all these things Theodore , the main character, was doing. I resist a lot of the new technology because I prefer direct human contact to being connected through devices and due to this am not all too familiar what is out there. I feel that we are getting more and more isolated by technology. Clothing and interior decoration in this movie did not look futuristic to me and human relationships never seem to change. It is always the same disaster. The easy way out seems to be to have sex by watching porn, to drop your partner if the first major problems show up and to avoid real interaction by communicating through devices. Now this film takes it one step further: the sex and the communication is all with the device and there is no more physical contact at all, because one of the partners has no body. It is a very seductive idea. I can imagine buying an OS which shares my interests, is highly educated and informed, is always available day and night, and always willing to exchange ideas and who takes an interest in my life and goals. In the online dating game you eventually had to meet your partner to find out if there is really a connection, the Operating system you can never meet so there can never be a solution. To avoid loneliness you have to resort to interact with human beings. When will we learn this?Good film. Great performance by Joaquin Phoenix and Scarlett Johanson.",10,3,6,24 January 2014
The Social Network," The desire to get laid earns him 25 billion, but he did not get lucky
","Recently I got more and more annoyed by the fact that every site I went on wanted me to log in with my facebook account . I thought that facebook was a site for people who wanted to get laid, and I did not see the connection with my political views or opinion about a TV show, so I saw no reason to join.( Also I had enough bad lays in my lifetime, I do not need any more.)When I heard all that Hallelujah about the Social Network movie I went to see it in the hope of understanding the younger generation and facebook better.My reaction leaving the theatre was mainly relief that I am not young anymore. The representation of life on Harvard campus and in California did not look like fun to me. Especially the way the girls were depicted was nauseating. I found myself confirmed that facebook was originally created by boys who wanted to get laid and that becoming a billionaire is easy nowadays if you find a way to promise social contact to enough lonely and desperate people . It is the same principle they sell deodorants, silicon breasts, hair transplants, botox, cars, make up, wonder bras, Oprah, mouth wash, fashion, Viagra, porn, alcohol, Dr. Phil, drugs, etc with. The only ones who get lucky in this game are the sellers not the buyers. The good message of the movie was that all the money in the world cannot buy that so much desired social contact.I found myself frequently checking my watch, which is not a good sign while watching a movie. The acting was good the guys were all supposed to be a-holes and they played that role quite well. The movie had a somber look to me and sometimes there was so much background noise that I had a hard time to follow the conversation. How sad that 500 million people have to join this site to get some social contact.......",3,96,190,6 October 2010
13 Hours," More question than answers, but fascinating to watch
","When I learned history in school I had trouble to relate. It seemed that they wanted me to learn mostly dates and places. And dates and places were not able to fascinate me. Luckily I was also an avid reader of fiction and reading historical novels made the events of the past so much more real . So to this day I have a tendency to look at historical events through the interpretation of artists, be it writers, painters, musicians or directors of movies. The older you get the more you realize that even events which happen during your life time and sometimes just around the corner from you are being interpreted in so many different ways, that at the end nobody really knows what happened. The attack in Benghazi certainly falls into this category. So politically charged and obfuscated, what was really going on? So I went to see the movie. First of all the movie was filmed in Malta not in Libya, I have been to Malta not to Libya and while there are similarities, they are not the same. The movie posed more questions than answers for me. Why was there so little security for the compound of the ambassador? Why did the official refused to send help? Why were these highly paid security contractors not used to help? Why did Tripoli refuse to send help? Why did the American base in Italy or Spain did not send help? All these places were not far away? I read somewhere that these American bases took 15 hours before they were able to dispatch somebody??? Why do the Libyan hate the Americans so much? Obviously big failure all around,from the state department to the pentagon and from some bureaucrats. So we are left with a handful of macho super warriors, who finally get permission, to fight hundreds of terrorists and that is the movie. We see this story in American war movies over and over again The super heroes who dodge all bullets while everybody else dies , they keep their sense of humor in even the most volatile situation and come out okay at the other end. Well, not everybody came out okay at the end and the film did a good job showing the humanity of those whose job is to kill and to be tough. So leaving the movie I was as knowledgeable as I was before. I do not know what happened I do not know what is being disguised from us and what orders have been issued to those who were there to shut up. I am glad to know that the surviving members of the warriors resigned and are pursuing a less dangerous life. Would I recommend that movie? Yes, I thought it was interesting but do not think that you know what happened afterward.",8,7,15,23 January 2016
Valkyrie," Cruise does not convince as a German aristocrat or officer
","I was talked into watching this movie and unfortunately I sat through it. Of all the movies I have ever seen about WWII, this one was the least convincing. None of the actors gave me the impression of being German. And Cruise as Stauffenberg was completely unconvincing as a German aristocrat of that time. I had seen the Reader before I saw Valkyrie and though I regretted that they chose non-German actors too, I very much enjoyed that movie and found it a good representation of the time and people I grew up with. I have a hard time understanding how anybody could find this movie interesting, I thought it was boring from the beginning to the end.",1,18,43,8 January 2009
The Martian," Starving yourself does not work, you just stay well fed
","To my big surprise I liked the Bourne movies with Matt Damon and this is why I went to see this 'Mars'movie with him. (I am not an action movie fan) Am I the only one who gets tired of seeing big stars raking in millions for a movie where they basically behave like they do on every talk show they visit to promote their movies. George Clooney comes to mind too. I have not read the book and after the movie I probably won't. But I understand that there was a lot of danger and suspension in the book, not so in the movie. Damon obviously is too big a star now to go through the trouble and actually loose weight for a role where he is supposed to nearly starve to death. Instead we get a naked, emaciated body of somebody else walking through the room and the well-fed Damon for the rest of the movie after eating minuscule portions for months. Decades ago I loved to see the NASA movies on Imax whenever I visited Houston or Cape Kennedy. None of the movies about space I have seen lately gave me the same sense of awe-inspiring greatness of our universe. I just sit there and ask myself if it is all filmed in a studio or in some desert , or is it all the work of computers? Nothing awe inspiring. Well, I should have learned my lesson by now, if a movie is really pushed by the studio I am always disappointed. Luckily I paid only four bucks to see it.",2,29,57,17 October 2015
