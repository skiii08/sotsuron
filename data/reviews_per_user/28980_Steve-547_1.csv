The Blair Witch Project," Suckered by hype
","Suckered again.  First, it was Phantom Menace, then Eyes Wide Shut, now and worst of all The Blair Witch Project.  Boring, I would have left after the first fifteen minutes if I hadn't been there with friends.  We all were annoyed by the overacting blurry people with a very limited vocabulary that appeared on the screen.This movie is a dud, it's overhyped, and should go down in the sucker hall of fame for claiming the most victims of any scam to date.  The only redeeming quality of the film was the amazing marketing campaign.",Null,1,3,18 August 1999
