Mission: Impossible III," great movie though the ending could have been better
","Tom Cruise did a fine job on the third sequel. Throughout the movie, the action scenes were consistent(with one exception). Very thrilling and a must see movie. Just don't watch the end part. The (end) part where Ethan Hunt and his wife went to the agency to say goodbye or whatever there purpose was (it wasn't emphasized in the movie) to the people he worked with is not really a good way to end the movie. It was somehow lame and it sort of did not relate to the movie, it turned out to be a love story. People will find the movie good but not as better as the first two movies before it. Among the three movies, this third one is the weakest. Though compared to other action movies (besides the 1 and 2), Mission Impossible 3 is a blast.",6,0,1,12 July 2006
