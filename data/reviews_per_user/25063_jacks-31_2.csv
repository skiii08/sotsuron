The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," A must for True Twilight fans
","Okay so yes there are plenty of haters out there and what I would like to ask them is why are you going to see this movie if you hate the franchise so much??? No one is being forced from where I am standing.I was very pleasantly surprised I thought the wedding was tastefully done and the romance just right. The honeymoon was much more than I expected after hearing how the wedding night scene was cut to meet pg13 standards.The three leads were the best in the series so far, strong performances all round with clear evidence of a good director and someone who actually took time to understand the story and know what the audience wanted. Well done Bill Condon.For almost two hours I was swept away into a fantasy world where the vampires sparkle and the werewolves talk. The easiness of one Mr Pattinson on the eye helps but I still think the film was well worth the wait and did justice to what could have been a very awkward version of a book being translated to film.",10,6,17,20 November 2011
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," Great but still didn't quite cover the real love story
","My very favourite book in the Saga. Not my favourite film however. Why? Coz I feel that the director has gotten carried away with too many irrelevant story lines including bigging up Jacob's role way too much. In this film he is whiney and I just want to slap him. They have so obviously jumped on the band wagon re Taylor Lautnors abs too. What they have missed out on is the real intense feelings between Bella and Edward. Some of the best lines from the book are omitted and the film is filled with inappropriate dialogue and far too many comedy moments. I really thought that Riley's back story was well done and appropriate. The new Victoria was poor, I much prefer the original who was more menacing and believable. Rosalie's and Jasper's back stories were okay, poor Rosalie she looks frightful throughout this film and her wig is laughable. Why was Alice's role in Eclipse not as prominent as in the book. I thought her and Bella's friendship really took off in the book. Edward's makeup was too extreme and the whole Cullen's contact lenses not right. I get the feeling David Slade is not team Edward. The soundtrack is brilliant. Well done to whoever pulled all the songs together. I really hoped to see some strong emotional scenes between Bella and Edward, I only got the 'leg hitch'. Lets hope Bill Condon is brave enough to tell the real 'Breaking Dawn' Melissa Rosenberg obviously isn't.Fav film of series Twilight, raw, emotive and the awkwardness of the young cast reflected well the awkwardness of the early Bella and Edward relationship.",8,2,9,17 July 2010
