The Incredible Hulk," Bring Back Lou Ferrigno
","Having read some reviews before I saw it, I thought this film was going to be absolutely terrible, but it was not nearly so bad as people were making out. I think a lot of people were expecting far too much in terms of depth of character, and for every detail and relationship between characters to exactly reflect the thinking of the original comic writers. Well that might have pleased the comic fanatics, but it isn't going to fill the cinemas with the easily-entertained masses.I have never read a Hulk comic, but I am a massive fan of the 70's/early 80's TV series with Bill Bixby. Hence I disliked the first Hulk film of 2003 very much.I was expecting more of the same with this film, but was surprised to see that it did resemble the sort of dumb-ass Hulk entertainment that I know and love much more than the first film.Ed Norton made a quite good David Banner - same sort of down-trodden far too nice born victim, and not too far off Bill Bixby's character. He looked quite hard in American History X, but now looks like Mr Puniverse.Tim Roth - I can never take him seriously no matter what he does, since seeing him in 'Made In Britain' screaming 'Oi, I want my lunch!' at Borstal canteen staff. His character, and indeed the stupid-looking second monster - which resembled Skeletor after taking a huge overdose of steroids - were rather unnecessary and added little to the film.The plot was OK without looking too deeply at some of the ridiculous exploits of the hulk - such as running virtually all the way from Brazil to Mexico in one night, and the usual unlikely way in which Banner's trousers can be expanded to the size of a house, yet still remain in one piece.I do wish that they would use a human actor to play the Hulk instead of this computer-generated rubbish. The hulk in this film just looked totally unbelievable and little like anything that a human could have possibly changed into. The Lou Ferrigno hulk was (relatively) believable and far more convincing and frightening than some 15 foot tall looney-toon.The other thing that was missing and I wish it would be reinstated is the 'DING!' sound when Banner's metamorphosis commences. It just isn't the same without that.I have given it 6/10. I'd probably watch it again if it was on TV.",6,2,6,14 July 2008
American History X," Irksome and Predictable Socialist Rant
","This film had been highly recommended to me as a 'must-see' by a friend of mine as it was apparently so thought-provoking and powerful.The only thing that this film provoked in me was anger and disappointment - not with the subject matter, but with the film makers, and this type of film in general.If this film had been put before us in a realistic and more balanced, politically-unbiased way, then it would have perhaps got its message across much more effectively.In terms of realism - virtually every character in the film is a ridiculous stereotype. The funniest example of non-realism has to be the black v white basketball match could not have been depicted any less realistically if they had tried.The scene: A group of skinheads (who as far as we know have never played the game before) challenge the blacks (who seem to spend the majority of their lives playing the game) to a gentlemanly basketball challenge, whereby whoever loses has to immediately vacate the premises and never come back. Of course the skinheads narrowly win, and the losers politely vacate the area without so much as an 'M.F.' being uttered.Yeah right...The overall impression I got from this film was that it was just another crude anti-white, anti-democratic, socialist rant-fest along the lines of other similar films (Romper Stomper etc), and the message it puts across is this: If you are a white man who prefers the company of his own kind and dislikes black people, then you are a brainwashed, monumentally unintelligent loser who is incapable of reasoning or making any judgements for yourself. You idolise an insane 1930's Austrian dictator and there is a high probability that you are a homosexual rapist.If you are a black man who prefers the company of his own kind and dislikes white people, then that is totally acceptable and cool. If you want to be obnoxious and confrontational to the white folks, and go around shooting them through the head for no good reason, that is understandable because they are all probably horrid racists and deserve it.This film should be burned along with the small-minded chumps that made it.",1,27,71,14 July 2008
