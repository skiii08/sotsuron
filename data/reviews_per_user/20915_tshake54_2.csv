Scarface," A legendary movie, Pacino's greatest performance
","Scarface is as perfect as any movie can be. It has a perfect story, actors that give life to the characters, and it's entertaining to the end. Scarface follows the life of Tony Montana (Pacino) as he sails to Miami to be free of oppression from Castro in Cuba. He wants the American dream, money, power, and respect, and he doesn't stop until he earns all three. This movie is pretty violent, but very tame to today's standard of violence. There is also a heavy amount of language in the film, including over 180 f-bombs, most by Pacino. But, this movie is also moderately funny, and you'll catch on to some of the jokes. This movie is EASILY a classic among classics, right up there with the Godfather. A perfect 10, this movie is flawless and a work of art, but I'm disappointed the critics didn't give it the credit that the movie deserved.",10,0,2,22 April 2006
Hostel," Roth And Tarantino Deliver with this excellent horror movie
","Hostel is one of those movies that will stay with you for a long time, but in a good way. The torture in the movie is really disturbing, with much gore and dismemberment. The violence is really kicked up a notch in this movie, too, unlike other popular horror movies, this movie pulls no punches. If you are under 18, I strongly recommend you not see this movie, due to the violence and disturbing brutal behavior. If you overlook some minor flaws with the film, such as limited plot development and very few characters that enrich the plot, you will find a very good horror movie with something original to offer the viewer. Just be prepared to be shocked and maybe disturbed after the movie. I give it a 9/10",9,1,1,22 April 2006
