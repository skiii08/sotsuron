Marie Antoinette," Pass on this Movie
","I started watching this not knowing really what to expect. But in the end I felt like I wasted 2 hours of my life. I thought it started out very promising and the story was moving along fine. But then after the couple was married I found it very hard to tell how much time has passed. I thought a week had passed and next thing I know his brother his married and Marie mentions they would look like fools if his brother becomes pregnant before they do. Next scene she is laying around and trying to get the future king to have sex...no go. Then the brother is having a baby. It seemed to be like this throughout. Music montages would go on or a song would play and sometimes it would be just to pass the time of the traveling carriage. Other times a short 10 seconds would pass and three years had passed. then a 20 minute segment on her birthday of nothing but gambling and drinking(which i understand why) but the pacing was simply off and became very boring. Then there were other parts that you think should be stressed like the baby dying...but all that was shown was a mere minute if that. But they kept showing all these random shots of her walking or laying around which did nothing for the story. Then the villagers become restless hold up the king and wife in the castle and a guard walks in covered in blood and says - 'They've come to kill the queen.' Then we watch them sitting eating, nodding, eating, crying. she goes out and bows to the crowd. They yell back. Then they let her go right out the front door and then it ends. Simply just of waste of time, the music didn't seem to fit half the time...just not good. Well except for the first 20 minutes.One thing I did like that actually showed some sort of character development and some plot progression is when she applauded to a play at the beginning everyone applauded with her...at the end no one did. Loved that scene, but that was it.I bought this used for $5 for my wife and I feel like I was ripped off. Not so much the money but the two hours I spent watching it.",2,2,3,13 May 2008
