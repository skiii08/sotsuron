Moneyball," Great film, even if you did not agree with everything in it
","I know little of baseball, but I quite liked this movie. It is the true story about how Oaklands Athletics manager Billy Beane (a fine performance by Brad Pitt), facing the loss of some of his best players after the end of the season, and with very little budget to hire good replacements, decided to apply statistical methods to find good but undervalued (and therefore, cheap) players. By traveling this path, he gets the opposition of much of the official baseball establishment (though this should not be exaggerated). To help him in this endeavor, he hired a young university graduate (played by Jonah Hill) to whom he soon becomes a mentor, introducing him to the business side of baseball. With these methods, Beane assembled a team for the following season that, while was unable to win the championship, did make it to the playoffs, and generally did much better than expected initially.The filmmakers are honest enough not to show Beane as a completely nice guy. He has a bad temper. He is cold and aloof with the players (he never travels with the team), refusing to become friends with them, in order to be easier to fire them. It is hinted that he wasn't that good as a husband. Despite these flaws, he is a compelling, generally sympathetic character.The movie basically believes that human intuition (in the form of the aging scouts) is no match for the mathematical and statistical methods of young nerds. If one has the romantic notion that not everything in life can be quantified, and that in some fields the human brain can still do better than a computer, then one feels oneself to be on the other side of the argument proposed by this movie.Also, although I'm not very knowledgeable about baseball, it seems to me that the changes proposed by Beane (no stolen bases, emphasis on reaching first base and not taking unnecessary risks) makes for a duller, if more standardized, game. So whether the end result of these changes he proposed made for a more entertaining game, it is debatable.But despite the fact that I was a bit uncomfortable with its thesis, I did like and enjoy the film.",9,1,2,28 December 2011
Howl's Moving Castle," Convoluted tale betrays Miyazaki's love for Victorian fantasy
","The action of Hayao Miyazaki's latest animated fantasy takes place in an undetermined place and age, though it looks like the late 19th century (allowing for a number of anachronistic details) in a Central European kingdom (the Austro Hungarian empire of the time seems the country where the action takes place, and the book happens in a place called Ingary, though the kingdom in the movie has a large port by the sea, which the Austro Hungarian empire didn't). The story starts with a young woman called Sophie working in a hat factory who is suddenly turned into a 90 year woman through a curse by some witch. She then tries to meet the wizard Howl, to see if he can help her. As it later turns out, Howl faces some curses of its own. The story soon becomes very convoluted, almost impossible to follow it wholly in just one sighting. After a while, you give up on understanding everything that is going on, and concentrate on enjoying its vivid details (Howl's literal melting of sadness is probably my favorite scene). What I found most engaging about the movie, rather than certain aspects of the plot, is its background details, which betrays Miyazaki's love for Victorian fantasy. I haven't read the original book, I know some people who had has taken issue with Miyazaki's liberties with the plot, but as it is, this is a very enjoyable movie to watch, even if the ending is a bit preachy in its endorsement of pacifism and environmentalism.",8,0,1,26 December 2006
The 13th Warrior," Emtertaining yarn
","Your run of the mill story about an 10th century Arab expelled from the caliph's court at Baghdad for looking at one of the women of his harem and going to Scandinavia to help a Viking kingdom resist the raids from a cannibalistic tribe. Except there are not that many movie with that theme. Based on Crichton's short novel 'Eaters of the Dead' (Crichton reportedly had a hand in the direction of the movie), this is an old-fashioned adventure movie. Crichton made the book as a blend from the real chronicles of an Arab traveler to the land of the Norsemen and the well known story of Beowulf. The movie blends this two sources greatly and you are likely to go through a good time in the theater (though if you can't stomach cinematic violence, you may as well skip it). And in how many Hollywood movies you get to see a Muslim play the good guy?",7,0,0,5 January 2007
Argo," Entertaining and suspenseful
","Very entertaining, suspenseful movie about how in 1979 the CIA exfiltrated six American diplomats who have escaped the takeover of the American embassy by supporters of the Ayatullah Khomeini and taken refuge in the Canadian embassy, without the knowledge of the Iranian authorities (the historical and political background is shown in an attractive animated segment at the beginning of the film - and is the only part in the movie where the Americans set themselves for criticism for their previous support of the deposed Shah). For that endeavor, the CIA sent an exfiltration expert, Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck, who is very good and who also directed). After conventional escape plans were explored and looked like they wouldn't work out, Mendez thought up a bizarre plan: go to Iran and leave with the six diplomats pretending that they belong to a Canadian film crew planning to film a B type Sci Fi film named Argo in Iran. To give credibility to the story, Mendez had two film producers (played by John Goodman and Alan Arkin) set up an office in Hollywood as if the planned movie was for real. Surprisingly, the ploy worked (since this story is public knowledge, I don't think saying this is much of a spoiler).Great recreation of an era and a place (Istanbul and Los Angeles are a believable stand-in for Tehran, along with some digital graphics playing the mountains in the background). Interesting and gripping throughout, even if some details were obviously added for dramatic effect (almost certainly the Iranians didn't chase the leaving plane in the runway). About the only flaw of movie: the constant, irritating, self absorbed in-jokes of the two movie producers.",9,2,4,28 October 2012
Black Book," Very entertaining film from Verhoeven
","Director Paul Verhoeven returns to his native Holland after more than 20 years (his last film there was 1983's The Fourth Man) and the result is a cinematic treat, probably his best film since Robocop. Both outrageous and exhilarating, Black Book tells the story of a Jewish singer (the excellent Carice Van Houten) and her improbable travails in occupied Holland during World War II. After spending a great part of the occupation hidden by some anti-Semitic farmers, her hiding place is bombed by the British towards the end of the war. She decides it's time to reunite with her family and escape with the help of some dubious people to allied-liberated Belgium. But there is an obvious betrayal during the escape and her whole family (along with other refugees) are killed by the Germans (she escapes miraculously by jumping into the water,007-style). After that, she joins the resistance, and a series of improbable situations occurs. When the son of one of the resistance leader is arrested, she is encouraged to seduce the German SS bigwig (whom she had met earlier on a train) so as to install a microphone inside the Nazi headquarters and help the resistance liberate the young man (the idea of a Jew becoming a lover of a high Nazi officer is, of course, highly offensive to many; the Nazi, by the way, is played by the fine actor who was the playwright in The Lives of Others). Many improbable things happen after wards, with incredible turns of events to the story happening at about every ten minutes, punctuated by deadly shootings between the Nazis and the Dutch resistance. The movie is 2hours and 25 minutes long, probably half an hour too much (it should have ended when Holland is liberated and she receives a less than stellar reception). It's impossible to take the movie very seriously (the movie claims to be based in true events, but this is almost certainly not true), but is extremely entertaining, and it shows Verhoeven at the top of his game.",8,4,6,19 June 2007
Orphan," Solid and creepy
","In this fine suspense/psychological horror film, an affluent couple in Connecticut decides to adopt a new child (she already has two children, one deaf, and has just lose her third in a miscarriage) and settles in an orphanage for a seemingly charming and very precocious nine year old Russian girl named Esther. Soon, though, the new member of the family shows a maturity well beyond her years and starts making terrible mischief with an escalating maliciousness that knows no boundaries, manipulating every member of the family to turn against each other and soon involving herself in real (as opposed to merely psychological) violence. Her adopted mother starts to suspect a terrible secret lies behind her. Eventually, things will escalate to murder. Well filmed (though there are too many false suspense moments) and especially well scripted, this movie has a final twist that I will not discuss here as not to spoil it to future viewers, but let me say that it is very nifty, it makes a lot of sense of what we just see before and puts this movie well above other run of the mill demon child stories. The performance by 12 year old Isabelle Fuhmann as an evil woman hiding inside a 9 year old girl is just mind blowing. Vera Farmiga, as the troubled mother seeing with impotence how this girl from hell is breaking her family is also fine.",8,3,6,1 November 2009
Juno," Warm and entertaining
","In a small town in America (in Minnesota, though it's never named in the movie), Juno, a wiseacre sixteen years old, finds herself pregnant after her sexual debut with her sweet high school pal and band mate (Michael Cera). With the support of her loving father and stepmother, she decides against an abortion, and plans to give her newborn child to a seemingly perfect but barren yuppie couple (Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner). But things will not go as planned, and under pressure, the couple will show themselves not as perfect as they first seem. Overall, a great film, with great songs (mostly by Kimya Dawson and the Moldy Peaches) and a superb performance in the title role by Ellen Page (an actress to watch in the future, that's for sure). Other great performances are by Bateman (as a child in man's clothes) and JK Simmons as Juno's understanding dad. As other reviewers has said, the first half hour is somewhat off putting, because Juno's such a smart ass, always spouting clever retorts and comebacks, that she threatens to be unbearable (any other actress playing the character would probably make it unwatchable). But the movie improves in the key scene of Juno breaking the news of her pregnancy to her parents. After that, the movie gets better and better, and it is quite moving by the end. Clearly, the character of Juno matures a lot throughout the movie. On the abortion issue, I think the movie is pro life without screaming it. Is the movie realistic in this sense? Probably not, but it's warm and very entertaining. Some of the name dropping is off putting, though (a sixteen year old in small town America familiar with the movies of Dario Argento? I don't think so. The same goes for her presumed love for punk rock, and bands that have already stopped recording by the time she was born).",8,2,7,18 February 2008
Children of Heaven," Very good (if a bit sentimental) Iranian film
","One of the new Iranian cinema's most accessible films, this is actually a very worthy movie, if a bit on the sentimental side (while Iranian movies have a strongly humanistic bent, they usually reject maudlin sentimentalism). Directed by Kiarostami's disciple Majidi, this story tells the tale of a brother and a sister from a poor neighborhood in Tehran. Problem comes when the boy, through no fault of his own, loses her sister's shoes. Since their family is too poor to buy a new pair of shoes, they have to share their shoes in secret, trading them off in a rush every day. The boy eventually comes up with a plan to solve this problem: entering into a race that gives a pair of shoes as a prize to the third-placed runner. The climactic race is a bit on the sentimental side, but the movie is very much worthwhile watching. And it has some nice side plots, as when the brother goes with his father to a rich Tehran neighborhood to find work as gardeners.",8,2,4,16 June 2007
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Hugely disappointing
","I read 'Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy' some twenty years ago. I don't recall all the details of the book, but I remember it being a beguiling novel (though I think that John Le Carre has written better books, like for instance, its sequel 'The Honourable Schoolboy'). The book is basically about taciturn spy George Smiley being brought back from retirement in order to catch a mole set by his Soviet nemesis, Karla, in the Circus (an alter ego for MI6, the British Intelligence Service). Now comes a film version of the novel, that roughly respects the plot (in 1979, there was a miniseries about the book, starring Alec Guiness as Smiley, which I haven't seen). The recreation of the era (the early 1970s) is fine, but this about the only good thing that I can say about this movie.First, in this movie, Smiley is performed by Gary Oldman, almost unrecognizable under loads of old age makeup (wouldn't it have made more sense to hire an older actor to play Smiley?).Second, the movie is at times dull and boring and its tone is ridiculously somber.Third, almost all the actors here perform languidly, as if they were making a parody of a British gentleman. Now, the cast includes many famous British actors (aside Oldman, we have Colin Firth, John Hurt, Toby Jones, Ciaran Hinds, and many others that are lesser known). These actors are usually fine performers in other movies, so clearly the filmmakers are at fault here.Fourth, the movie is virtually impossible to understand if you haven't read the book (understandably so, considering six hours of the miniseries have been compressed to two hours).Worst of all, the climactic scene when the mole is finally caught (for obvious reasons, I'm not going to say who he is) is, well, totally anticlimactic, to the point where the audience might felt cheated, after all the previous buildup (by the way, it is interesting to see that when the traitor is find, he is initially treated with kids gloves, as if never forgetting that while he might be a Soviet spy, he hasn't stopped being a gentleman. So, in a way, this movie suggests that postwar Britain might have not been very well suited to the ruthless game of international espionage).So, summing up, a great disappointment, a movie that despite high expectations and high critical acclaim has in my opinion little to recommend for it.",4,3,6,16 January 2012
The Adventures of Tintin," Disappointing
","A huge disappointment by two genuinely great directors specialized in popular entertainment, like Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson. The secret of The Unicorn was the first Tintin book I read (my parents give it to me as a present when I was 9 years old, more than thirty years ago). It is also one of my favorite Tintin books. This might be why I felt so disappointed by this. Absent from the movie is all the subtlety in the book. What is present here is a very heavy handed, video-game like approach.In theory, this could have been a match made in heaven, as previous works by Spielberg especially (like the Indiana Jones franchise) have a strong resemblance to Tintin, in terms of plot and in terms of the epoch (the thirties and the forties were the epoch were both Tintin and Indiana have their best outings). In practice, the film doesn't work. Let's try to analyze why.Let's first concede that Tintin is difficult to bring into the screen (previous adaptations, both animated and live-action, have failed). I think one of the reasons is that Tintin lives in a very stylized world, and this becomes quite obvious when one transplants Tintin from a drawing in a paper to a photographic medium (even in the form of computer animation).The charming plot of the book (Tintin finds by accident a manuscript hidden inside a model ship called the Unicorn that might be a clue to a hidden treasure, and soon sees himself chased by other people interested in that treasure), has some minor changes, but those changes are generally for the worst. For instance, the slimy Bird brothers in the book were better villains than Ivan Sakharine in the film, who was not one of the bad guys in the original book. Mixed up with the plot of the Unicorn (and in a not very convincing manner), appear elements of other Tintin books, especially The Crab with the Golden Claws, another favorite of mine.Lastly, the animation is not completely convincing: the problem of the unrealistic eyes (the so called uncanny valley, which many have pointed already in The Polar Express, and which evidently hasn't been solved) makes for a Tintin that is slightly creepy. By the way, the photography is some scenes is too dark and murky, when the Tintin books are famous for the use of bright colors and little contrast (the famous clear line style).",5,13,22,25 December 2011
Pan's Labyrinth," Great film, but not a masterpiece
","1944. Spain has just come out of the civil war, and the fascist Franco regime is in power. A small group of republican fighters, though, hold on to a small territory in the remote forested mountains of northern Spain. There, a girl named Ofelia, fascinated with fairy tales, arrives with her sick mother to meet her stepfather, a brutal captain of the regime keen on exterminating the remnant republicans. Living with the military in an old mill, at night Ofelia meets a fairy who takes her to an old Faun, which urges her to complete three treacherous tasks. The movie, thus, occurs both in 'reality' and in fantasy. I like Del Toro's previous Hellboy. Pan's Labyrynth is also a great movie, but I think it was just a bit overrated. The movie is well made, the atmosphere and special effects are great, the plot holds your attention, the performances are great. So why I'm a bit hesitant to endorse this movie as a masterpiece? I'm not totally sure, but the movie may be too 'arty' for its own good, the film is just a bit too neat, straining for significance while trying to attract both terror film fans and art movie buffs, while probably pleasing neither completely. And in light of history, what does the republicans victory means at the end (unless Del Toro just wanted to please the crowds?)",8,1,3,31 March 2007
Begin Again," Feel good movie of the year
","Very pleasant film starring Keira Knightley as Gretta, a Briton leaving in New York. She has just separated from her rock star boyfriend and writing partner Dave (Adam Levine), and is about to return to London, when she is asked to perform impromptu by his friend Steve (James Corden) in a club. Down and out producer Dan (Mark Ruffalo) happens to be there at the time, and is entranced by her performance and tries to sign her for a record label headed by his ex partner Saul (nicely played by rap artist Mos Def). She is initially reluctant but finally goes along.Though marketed as a romantic comedy, it hardly follows the 'boy meets girl' formula. Knightley sings many songs in the movie, not all memorable (I did like 'A step you can't take back' which is included in the movie's best scene, as Dan imagines Gretta's acoustic performance accompanied by a full rock orchestra). Knightley usual charm is the major driver of this feel-good movie, though most performances are fine. Also with Catherine Keener and Hailee Stanfield, as Dan's ex wife and daughter. There is a great scene after the final credits you should wait for.",8,1,3,4 October 2014
Battleship Potemkin," Has aged somewhat, but still must see for film buffs
","Sergei Eisenstein's landmark film, from 1925, alerted western audiences that something important was happening in the Soviet Union in terms of film-making (Lenin: 'Cinema to us is the most important art'). The film itself deals with the 1905 uprising of the battleship of the title, how the crew of the ship rebelled against the czarist officers when they were asked to eat rotten meat, how after the mutiny the ship landed in the port of Odessa in the Black Sea (receiving the support of the population), and how the rebellion was suppressed by troops loyal to the regime. To achieve its effects, the film used the then new technique of rapid cutting. Elected in a film congress in 1959 as the best film ever, and still considered a classic, it hasn't aged that well. There is the famous scene of the repression at the Odessa steps, repeated so many times in TV, that are famous to even those who hadn't seen the movie. Whatever its failings, every film buff should see this movie at least once. Personally, I think Eisenstein made better movies, for example, 'Alexander Nevsky' or 'Ivan the Terrible'. It is unfortunately true that cinema ages much faster than other forms of art. For example, one can read a novel written in the 1930s without much problems, yet most movies made in that decade look terribly dated now (I think many movies made in the 60s and 70s look dated). This has to do with cinema being an art supported by technology, and technology can get outdated quickly, of course. But there must be something else that I'm not able to define that make movies age so quickly.",5,8,15,27 January 2008
Bridget Jones's Diary," Five years later, I recant my original review
","A horrifying example of a chick movie. I admit that I kind of like it when I first saw it on 2001, and gave it a good rating and review for IMDb. However, viewing the movie again a number of times over the years showed me there are many things that are wrong with this film. Look, Renee Zellweger has a good performance (though right now, her cinematic persona has kind of overstay her welcome). The plot is basically about Bridget having to choose between dour lawyer Darcy (Colin Firth) or sexy cad Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant). Neither of them is a very satisfactory individual. Arguing who was the best guy for her, as I did in my original review is besides the point. Besides, what is more off putting about this film is that Bridget stupidity is supposed to be representative of the modern woman. I want to believe that this is not true, but unfortunately, the huge success of this film shows that many women agree with that judgment. (in order to not be totally negative about this movie, let me say that the sequel is way worse).",6,0,1,16 November 2006
28 Weeks Later," Entertaining, violent and intelligent
","A very good zombie film, it even surpasses its predecessor, the very worthy 28 Days Later. Directed by Spanish director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, the movie starts 28 weeks after the first film. With the first outbreak apparently ended, an American led military force arrives at the deserted London (in a not so subtle allusion to the occupation of Iraq), securing certain areas and allowing English citizens who have been abroad during the outbreak to return. Among them are two children (played by Imogen Poots and Mackintosh Muggleton; one of the best scenes of the movie has nothing to do with zombies and have them running through the deserted streets of the English capital). As expected, though, the zombies have not exactly disappeared, and are bound to return with a vengeance. Robert Carlyle does a fine turn here as a survivor of the first outbreak who becomes infected here (and the opening scene is great). Intelligent, very bloody, entertaining, what more can you ask from a horror film.",8,0,0,3 January 2010
The Battle of Algiers," One of the best political films ever
","One of the best political films ever, about the 1954-1957 uprising of Algiers against French colonial rule. As the film shows, the uprising was brutally crushed, but the seeds of independence had already been sown, and in 1960 a new uprising, covering all Algeria, would rise up, and the country would become independent two years later. The French colonists, who numbered more than a million and who had lived in Algeria for more than a century, would be expelled after wards, marking a complete defeat for France. Made in 1965, with financing by the Algerian independent government, it is nevertheless surprisingly fair in some aspects. It shows the brutal terror tactics employed by the FLN (the main Algerian liberation group) like bombing bars and discos used by the Europeans. It also shows the French colonel in charge of suppressing the revolt (played by the only professional actor in the cast) in a quite positive light: in a film without true heroes, he is probably the most sympathetic character, competent and self-effacing, even if he doesn't flinch in using torture to crush the revolt (torture being in his mind the only method to destroy the FLN's cell structure). And, perhaps inadvertently, by showing the terror tactics used by the FLN, it suggests the oppressive, antidemocratic nature of the future independent government of Algeria. Overall, one of the must-see films in every cinephile list (and in any person interested in the politics of the region or in anti terror tactics).",10,1,2,25 November 2007
The White Ribbon," Delicately filmed but pretentious
","A pretentious film from the haughty but occasionally interesting Austrian art filmmaker Michael Haneke (Hidden/Cache, for instance, was a fine if unsubtle movie about the profound guilt that westerners should feel for being successful, a common theme from the director). Filmed in a delicate black and white, The White Ribbon takes place in a small German town in the immediate period before World War I. Through a number of mysterious violent acts occurring in the village, Haneke wants to show the hypocrisy of a society rigidly stratified by class. Haneke refuses either to give a clear explanation of these acts (though they turn out to be carried out by children of the community) or to follow a clear narrative line. These make the movie more irritating than surprising (though there always will be snobs that will claim that we are in front of a masterpiece). Some reviewers have claimed the movie to be some sort of metaphor for the birth of National Socialism (with the children supposedly turning into Nazis 25 years later), but there is really nothing here about this. Boring and disappointing.",3,27,65,8 August 2010
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Not completely worthless, but disappointing
","A Hollywood remake of a Swedish movie made just two years ago, is the first part of the best selling trilogy Millennium, by the late Swedish author (and journalist) Stieg Larsson. The plot is mostly about how investigative journalist Michael Blomkvist (clearly an alter ego of Larsson) is asked by Henrik Vanger, an aging captain of industry to solve the murder of his favorite niece forty years ago. By some strange circumstances, he will be helped in the investigation by the pierced, troubled hacker Lisbeth Salander, with whom professional cooperation will soon turn into the personal as they discover the very dark secrets running under the very successful Vanger family. The Hollywood version is also set in Sweden, though here all the characters speak in English.As much as I like the original movie (I haven't read the books) I must admit that its view of the world is a bit naive, equivalent to an earnest teenager shouting that the whole world is corrupt. In the US version, Blomkvist is played by Daniel Craig (a fine actor who has made a career playing macho guys) as a stronger and more attractive man than in the Swedish movie (where he was played by the older and somewhat chubby Michael Nyqvist). On the other hand, the Lisbeth Salander character is played in the remake by Rooney Mara as a weaker woman than in the original (she might be a fine actress, but she doesn't show it here, despite critical acclaim for her performance). Noomi Rapace made a far stronger impression as Lisbeth in the Swedish movie.Though there are not major changes in the movie plot, the Hollywood version does make small variations, which I think are generally for the worse. For instance, when Craig tries to understand the meaning of certain numbers that might be a clue to the murder, his daughter, who is a fervent catholic going to a religious camp, alerts him that they are a biblical reference. This scene is unlikely, since there are very few Catholics in Sweden, or very religious people for that matter, as it is a very secular country. In the original version, the character of the daughter does not appear, and is Lisbeth, by surfing in the net, that finds the religious connections.The director is David Fincher. He has occasionally made fine movies (for instance, Zodiac) but most of the time his work tend to the flashy and empty (Seven, Fight Club), the overrated (The Social Network) if not to the directly mediocre (Benjamin Button). This movie is not totally worthless, but it is disappointing, and it is considerably weaker than the original version.",5,4,9,26 January 2012
The Lego Movie," Surprisingly good, animated film is a triumph
","A very entertaining, wildly imaginative animated film based on a seemingly terrible material: the Danish brand of toy interlocking bricks. Emmet is an everyman construction worker who works for the Octan Corporation, the only company in the very conformist Legoland and whose president is the evil Lord Business (for a movie that includes a brand in its title, its tone is surprisingly anti corporate). When Emmet unexpectedly finds a piece called the Piece of Resistance (whom a Gandalf-like wizard called Vitruvius has prophesied would be found by the chosen one who would overthrow the tyranny of Lord Business), he is sought by the henchmen of Lord Business, while he is helped in his escape by the rebel girl Wildstyle. Funny and entertaining (the movie includes an extended part of a Lego Batman), surprisingly profound at times (the movie in some way is a paean to common man Emmet) and with nods to such films as The Truman Show and The Matrix. The dazzling computer animation and the intelligent script help a lot. Among the actors giving voice to the animated characters are Will Ferrell, Liam Neeson and Morgan Freeman. Towards the end, two human actors (including Ferrell) appear to give the plot a tight ending.",9,1,5,9 February 2014
District 9," Violent but well done film is much more politically incorrect than perceived
","This quite violent science fiction film from South Africa is about seemingly slow witted aliens (who look like giant insects or crustaceans) who arrived in a giant spaceship over Johannesburg some decades ago, and were forcibly put by the government into a camp (actually one big slum) inside the city called District 9, where they live in despairing conditions. When the government decides to relocate them to concentration camps far from Johannesburg, Wikus, a nerdy public servant involved in the relocation, is sprayed with a liquid (which the aliens plan to use in a ploy to return to their planet) and slowly starts to mutate into an alien. Considered now to be a threat to the state, Wikus decides to become a fugitive and help the aliens in their plans (more things happen, but I leave the plot there). While not totally successful, it is nevertheless entertaining, and gives quite food for thought, in ways different than most critics thought. Many critics and commentators lazily called this an apartheid allegory, but if anything the film is much more politically incorrect than that: it's really about the despair white South Africans feel when they realize they are now a tiny minority in a country flooded in crime, driven in part by immigration from other African countries (the portrayal of Nigerians as brutal criminals living alongside the aliens in the slums is particularly heavy handed – it's surprising the film wasn't more denounced for this). The constant use of hand-held camera is a bit tiresome – and may make you feel dizzy as well.",7,0,6,17 October 2009
To Rome With Love," Woody Allen latest movie is slight but fun
","Woody Allen's choral film set in Rome shows that at 76 he can still be a fine filmmaker. It consists of four intercalated though unrelated episodes, two with Italians in the center, one with Americans and the last with both Italians and Americans.In episode 1 (the numbers I gave to each of the episodes is arbitrary), a somewhat naive newlywed couple from an Italian small town (Alessandro Tiberi and Alessandra Mastronardi, who resembles a young Marisa Tomei, and is great as the beautiful but plain Milly) comes to Rome. A series of circumstances will make them to be separated and face temptation, he to a prostitute catering to Rome's high class (Penelope Cruz), she to a famous if somewhat pathetic older actor (Antonio Albanese).In episode 2 (not completely bad, but probably the weakest of the four), Roberto Benigni, overacting as usual, is a Roman everyman who suddenly and inexplicably becomes a celebrity hounded by the press.In episode 3 (probably the best), Jack (Jesse Eisenberg) is an American student living in Rome with his sweet if somewhat bland girlfriend, Sally (Greta Gerwig). Soon the two are joined by a friend of Sally, the unemployed actress Monica (Ellen Page). The beautiful Monica is a great creation by the screenplay, a neurotic pseudo intellectual always quoting authors she has scarcely read. Under a veneer of worldly sophistication, she is a vain, shallow and vapid woman. As Monica tries to seduce Jack, Jack is advised by Alec Baldwin (a middle aged architect visiting Rome) that it would be foolish to leave the dependable Sally for the unstable Monica. The Baldwin character starts realistically but ends up being something of a ghost, since he materializes in every place and only Jack seemingly sees him. In his role as a ghostly adviser to a young male on questions of women and love, he resembles the Bogart character in Allen's great comedy of 40 years ago, the underrated 'Play it Again, Sam'.In episode 4, Alison Pill is an American tourist who falls in love with a left wing Roman lawyer. Soon she brings her parents from the States (Woody Allen and Judy Davis, who is great as his shrink wife, always ready to psychoanalyze every one of Woody's decisions) to meet her new in laws. Allen is a retired former executive in the classical musical business, and after listening to Giancarlo (played by Fabio Armiliato, a real life Italian tenor), the father of his son in law, singing in the shower, he tries to convince him to try a career as an opera singer, to amusing results.Some might say that the episodes are slight (and in a way they are right) but the movie contains some wise reflections on old age, fame, love, whether is better to settle or try for more, etc. In any case, I (and the audience with which I saw it) enjoyed quite a lot. The message of the film seems somewhat conservative: if you are happy with what you are, why aspire for more if that means you have to sell your soul. That might be a right message, though it strange to hear it from the famous Allen.",9,5,13,30 June 2012
Saving Private Ryan," Sentimental film about D-Day has both flaws and merits
","I wasn't too impressed with this film when I saw it more than a decade ago. It's a very corny and sentimental retelling of the landing in Normandy during World War II and subsequent battles in France. The film starts and closes in a veterans cemetery during the present times (that is, around the time it was filmed), and perhaps one of the reasons that the filmmakers made it so sentimental is that around the time it was released, and for obvious biological reasons, many WW2 veterans started dying. I remember that another film dealing with World War II was released at around the same time, Terrence Malick's The Thin Red Line, which dealt with the war in the Pacific and it was far more gripping and stronger and far less sentimental movie. Private Ryan opens with a now famous scene of the landing in Normandy that is very well done, but the film sort of goes downhill (though not catastrophically) from there on. The character of the German prisoner, for instance, is very crudely written and performed. I have to say, however, that one thing that impressed me about the movie is that it shows American soldiers killing German soldiers as they were surrendering. This undoubtedly happened quite a lot in World War II (and in many wars, I suppose), yet few films show such things. And Spielberg shows this matter of factly, he doesn't give moral judgment on this. For this honesty, I praise the movie. But on balance, I think this movie is only fair.",6,2,5,2 March 2011
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Best effort by Wes Anderson since The Royal Tennenbaums
","I avoided this movie when it came out, since the last two films I've seen of director Wes Anderson, The Light Aquatic and the Darjeeling Limited, were utterly terrible. Only with the recent multiple Oscar nominations of this movie, I decide to give this a chance. And guess what: it is a great movie, his best since the Royal Tennenbaums. Set mostly in the 1930s in a fictional Central European state (the film was mostly shot in Southern Germany) - though with a nifty introduction from the 1960s that frames the narrative with Jude Law and F. Murray Abraham - the Grand Hotel Budapest tells the story of the said hotel - one in the classical European style - that is run by the concierge M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) helped by the bellboy Zero (Tony Revolori)Fiennes is great as Gustave, a cultured, suave womanizer specialized in wooing elderly ladies who sees himself as a beacon of civilization in an age of increasing barbarism. When one of his 'customers' (Tilda Swinton) dies and decides to give part of her inheritance to Mustafa, her two psycho sons (Adrien Brody and Willem Dafoe) will left no stone unturned in trying not to give others what they think is rightfully theirs.This movie has an impressive all star cast. Along with those already named, we also have Edward Norton, Jeff Goldblum, Harvey Keitel, Saoirse Ronan, Mathieu Amalric and (in smaller roles), Bill Murray, Lea Seydoux, Owen Wilson and Jason Schwartzmann. And Anderson's mannerisms and eccentricities are not so off putting here (well, maybe with exceptions, like what does the mole with the size of Mexico in Saoirse Ronan means?). Inspired by the writings of Stefan Zweig.",9,8,13,24 January 2015
Gone Girl," Terrific thriller with a great performance by Rosamund Pike
","A terrific thriller by David Fincher. Twisted and manipulative, in the best sense of the word, this two and a half hours film is based on a very famous book I have not read. Ben Affleck plays Nick as a quintessential average guy. Some years ago she met the well-off Amy (Rosamund Pike, in a stellar, award worthy performance) while living in New York and they eventually married. When his mother got sick, they return to live in his Missouri hometown, where despite their successful facade as a couple, she feels understandably bored by living in a small town. So as the movie starts, we have Nick return to their home in the day of their 5th wedding anniversary, to find Amy has disappeared and there are violent signs in the house. He calls the police, and soon enough, despite his protestations of innocence, incriminating evidence starts appearing against him. The case becomes famous nationally, the media starts to hound him, and soon we know that their marriage was far from picture perfect. But was this enough for him to kill her, in case she is really dead?In this kind of movies, the reviewer must say as little as possible about the plot. But I have to mention the only problem I have with this film (SLIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD): I wince during the middle part of the movie, as a particular plot by Amy to exact revenge from her husband is revealed. Without saying anything about it, it seems wholly implausible (I know most thrillers are hardly realistic and work by suspension of disbelief; it just that during that part my disbelief wasn't suspended). The third act which closes the film, though, is great and makes you leave the theater with a smile.There are some supposedly serious messages in the movie about the nature of marriage and relationships, the perfidy of modern media or the hypocrisy of small town society, but I think you can just enjoy this as a great thriller in the Hitchcock-De Palma tradition. Also with Neil Patrick Harris, Carrie Coon and Emily Ratajkowski, among others in the large cast.",9,1,10,4 October 2014
The Theory of Everything," Crowd pleasing biopic is glossy but hard to dislike
","This crowd pleasing biopic of physicist Stephen Hawking, a sort of cross between A Beautiful Mind and My Left Foot, is glossy but is also hard to dislike. Hawking's life story is by now known by most people – struck by the terrible and incurable motor neuron disease in 1963 when he was a Ph.D. student in physics at Cambridge University, and told he had just two years to live, he decided nevertheless to go ahead with his life, marry his girlfriend Jane (played wonderfully here by the sweet petite Felicity Jones) and become a world renowned theoretical physicist exploring subjects such as the nature of time and black holes. 52 years later, he is still alive, though virtually immobile and trapped in a wheelchair, communicating through a computer.This movie is based on Jane's autobiography, and so it focuses less on his scientific achievements and more on how Jane coped with his consuming illness, while raising three children (!). One of their differences was that Hawking was an outspoken atheist while his wife was a practicing Christian. Ironically, given his atheism, the movie suggests it was Jane's deeply religious belief that made her care for him despite his increasing disabilities. An atheist or agnostic girlfriend, might have balked at caring for him after learning about his illness. The movie also suggests that Hawking's strange allusions to God in his bestselling book 'A Brief history of Time' was a concession to his long caring wife.Eventually, their marriage proved too difficult and exhausting, and after many years, they both end up settling with different persons, she with the choirmaster of her local church (played by Charlie Cox), and he with his full time nurse (Maxine Peake). Eddie Redmayne is wonderful in the starring role. He plays Hawking as arrogant, somewhat mischievous and not always likable, which is understandable given his crippling illness. Also with Emily Watson, David Thewlis and Simon McBurney. Directed by James Marsh.",9,0,0,6 February 2015
The Lives of Others," Great movie - just a notch down a complete masterpiece
","The Lives of Others is a great, even excellent movie. I can't give it a 10 out of 10 rating, though. On the plus side, the director has a total command of the medium, he knows how to make a suspenseful, thoughtful, entertaining movie, that holds the interest of the audience even at a running time that exceeds 2 hours. What's more, the acting is uniformly extraordinary. Let's talk now about the main reason why I can't give the movie a 10. The emotional heart of the movie is when the Stasi officer in charge of spying the playwright and his girlfriend, a very tough and experienced individual who presumably has worked in many similar cases before, decides instead to protect them. Why he would do that, risking an end to his career and even a charge of treason?. Though his motivations are not altogether clear (he is an extremely reserved man), the change of heart seems to happen in part after listening the playwright playing a sonata on the piano after learning one of his colleagues committed suicide, after years of harassment by the government (he is also uneasy after finding out the Stasi is going for the playwright not for ideological reasons but in order that his beautiful girlfriend would then be available for the repellent minister of culture). As a metaphor from his newly found sensibility, he even steals a book from Brecht from the playwright's house, and is seen reading it. Is this believable? As much as the audience would be moved by a story of redemption, I think it's not. This is not a minor quibble, since this change of heart is really the main plot twist of the movie, on which all the film is build. The ending has a great closing line, but is also a bit difficult to accept. From what I know, few if any Stasi officers have expressed any remorse from what they did, and continue to defend their actions. That aside, this is a great film, from a young director that really knows how to make a movie that is both highly entertaining and thought provoking. And it has many great scenes that you vividly remember later. The best one: the young Stasi officer making a ill-timed Honecker joke in the cafeteria. It's a scene that's so good on so many levels.",9,1,2,25 April 2007
The Elephant Man," One of Lynch's best films
","David Lynch's finest film, alongside with perhaps Mulholland Drive. John Hurt, under tons of makeup, stars as David Merrick, the real-life grotesquely deformed individual of Victorian England that was better known as The Elephant Man. Merrick is the virtual slave of a brutish man (a great performance of Freddie Jones) that parades him as a carnival freak until he is rescued by the sensitive doctor Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins). Treves decides to put Merrick in a hospital room, winning over the initial skepticism of its director, John Gielgud. In the hospital, Merrick will start to talk for the first time, begin to regain his dignity, and eventually will become a curiosity of high society before his premature death. Shot in a delicate and expressionist black and white, the only flaw in the movie might be the performance of Ann Bancroft (producer Mel Brooks's wife) as a stage actress interested in Merrick's life. Except for the surreal opening and closing scenes (in which Merrick is born and dies, respectively), here Lynch is relatively restrained, opting for a style that could be called poetic realism. The film earned eight Oscar nominations in all, but left that race empty-handed, an earlier indication that Lynch's films would not be the typical Academy material.",9,1,1,26 January 2008
School of Rock," Disappointing
","This movie's plot deals with a no-good wannabe rock star (Jack Black, wildly overacting as usual) suddenly and by mistake taking the job of substitute teacher at a posh school (right, things like this happen all the time), and using it to teach rock music to his students (who are around 9) to the consternation of the school authorities. Most of the rock is from the early 70s, so probably not even the children's parents were born when this music was made. I think the rock of that era is wildly overrated by people who happened to be in their teens at that time like director Linklater (actually, I think rock 'culture' is overrated, period). This reminds me of another poor movie, Velvet Goldmine, where glam rock, a marginal movement if there was one, was treated as a major artistic achievement, a la par with Oscar Wilde!.",3,3,12,30 January 2007
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Excellent thriller
","This Swedish film is one of the best thrillers I've seen in a long time. Based on a best seller novel by Stieg Larsson I haven't read (the first in a trilogy), it starts with Mikael, a middle aged investigative journalist being asked by the old patriarch of a powerful business clan to solve the disappearance of his beloved 16 year old nephew forty years ago. Since this happened during a family reunion at an isolated island, the patriarch believes that she was murdered, and that only a member of the family could have done so. Mikael is soon joined in the investigation by Lisbeth Salander, a troubled but brilliant twenty something female hacker, and soon they are lifting the veil on the very dark secrets behind this prestigious family. Gripping throughout, the film benefits from a number of terrific performances, especially Noomi Rapace playing Lisbeth Salander and Sven Bertil Taube as the patriarch of the clan. While the film is more than two hours long, it is never boring, and all the loose ends are tied brilliantly at the end.",10,59,86,17 January 2010
Mulholland Drive," Lynch's best film
","The first time I saw Mullholland Drive, I was impressed by it, but also more than a little confused, like many viewers, specially in the second part of the movie. After watching it two more times, I believe it is a true masterpiece, with a wonderful clockwork screenplay: many things that look arbitrary in a first viewing, came neatly into place after repeated sightings. The movie is structured in two parts (SPOILERS INCLUDED, don't read if you haven't yet seen it): a real part and a dream part. While the real part comes first chronologically, Lynch shows the dream first. In the 'real' part, Diane (Naomi Watts) is one of those many girls that arrived in Hollywood from small towns throughout North America dreaming of getting a big break in the silver screen. Unfortunately for her, she is a mediocre actress. In a casting, she meets another actress called Camila (Laura Harring), who gets the main role. They become friends, get to live together, and eventually fall in love. Camila becomes successful in town, and she helps Diane in getting small roles in the movies she stars in. But Camila falls in love with one of her directors, Adam, so she and Diane splits bitterly. Some time later, Camila invites Diane to a party, where she is humiliated by the guests, and becomes silently enraged when Camila and Adam become engaged. In that party, she mets a few individuals (a man with a cowboy hat, Adam's mother) that would later appear in her dreams, in another roles. (Here Lynch deftly understands the logic of dreams, where people one knows usually appear under different names or roles). After the party, Diane hires a hit-man to kill Camila. He tells her that when the job is done, he will drop a blue key under her door. When Diane later finds the key and becomes aware than Camila is dead, she becomes remorseful, and shots herself. As she agonizes between life and death, Diane has a last dream, which is the first part of the movie. In the dream, Diane is the great actress she wishes she has been. As in the real part, she arrives in Hollywood for a movie career, but unlike reality, in the dream she is talented and successful. In her apartment, she founds an amnesic woman (who has the face of Camila). As for Adam, since she hates him for being engaged with Camila, she imagines him in horrible situations, cheated by his wife, being forced by mobsters in making his movies in a way he doesn't like. The cowboy Diane met at the party appears here as scaring Adam into picking another actress for the main role in the movie. The hit-man she hired is presented as impossibly clumsy, perhaps in her secret desire that he didn't do his job well. There are many things more, but I hope you get the idea of the structure present in the movie, and why it is not arbitrary but has its own impeccable logic. This is Lynch's best film, with a superb screenplay, and a nifty understanding of dream logic.",10,6,10,14 September 2007
Grave of the Fireflies," Sad and extremely moving, but very rewarding animated film
","Very moving animated film from Japan, based on an autobiographical novel. Set in Japan in the final months of World War II, it is about a couple of children – a boy of about 12 and her sister of about 4 and how they try to confront their awful circumstances. Their father, about whom they haven't had news for a while, is supposedly at sea, being an officer in the Japanese navy – they live with their mother, but she is soon killed after an American air raid. They go to live with an aunt, but she's so nagging towards them that they soon leave and decide to live in a cave for themselves in the terrible final weeks of the war. Haunted by bombings and hunger, they nevertheless try to keep their spirits high, one of their few amusements being seeing the fireflies light up at night. I don't want to tell more, but the ending is far from happy. The movie shows why in wars, innocent civilians are the ones that suffer most. The delicate drawings help a lot.",9,1,2,7 October 2012
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Manipulative, unbelievable
","During World War II, the unbelievably naive eight year old child of the Nazi commander of a concentration camp becomes the friend, through the barbed wire (with nary a guard in sight) of an eight year old inmate of said camp. Eventually, he decides to enter the camp (excavating a tunnel through it!) to help his friend find his father. Their destiny is (spoiler ahead) the gas chamber, in a jaw dropping awful scene. Unabashedly sentimental and terribly manipulative, this movie makes Roberto Benigni's famously awful 'Life is Beautiful' a model of taste by comparison. Maybe in the original book (which I have not read) this works as a fable, but I'm not exaggerating by saying that there is not a single moment in this film that is believable. For starters: If it was so easy to enter the camp, with just a shovel, how come the inmates didn't escape?. And the scene where the mother cries as the rain is pouring when she realizes the fate of her child and the camera moves upward is a textbook case of cinematic manipulation. Avoid this at all costs.",2,13,36,10 December 2008
The Imitation Game," Almost worthless biopic of a true genius. Fine production values are the main thing to recommend in this.
","If you see this picture without prior knowledge of Alan Turing's life, there is some probability that you might like this (otherwise, I can't explain its high ratings here or its raving reviews), but anyone familiar with the life of this remarkable individual will rightly see this movie as a travesty.But first let me put forward some good things to say about this movie: there are some fine production values, there is some fine acting here (especially by Benedict Cumberbatch as Turing) and a good, if flashy direction (by Norway's Morten Tildum). But they all struggle against a worthless screenplay. This is the worst screenplay I have ever seen put into a movie (and I have seen hundreds of movies, having reviewed almost 500 in IMDb). Worthy of a pretentious high school student, it is a mixture of ludicrous melodramatics and historical illiteracy.The movie give us a rough, true outline of Turing's life (brilliant mathematician, computer pioneer, very nerdy personality, helped break Germany's Enigma machine codes during the war, which proved very important in the battle of the Atlantic facing English ships against Germany's submarines, his career crashes dramatically in 1952 when after a burglary in his house police finds he is a homosexual, which was a criminal offense in Britain until 1967, forced by a judge to take hormone therapy in order to avoid prison).But alongside this true outline a lot of falsities are added. Just to mention a few of these falsehoods, without being exhaustive: 1) the movie never tells that it was the Poles before the War who first constructed a machine that was able to break Enigma. Turing and his team (not just him) did build an upgraded machine that was able to crack an upgraded Enigma, 2) Turing's military superiors - personified here by commander Denniston (Charles Dance) – hate Turing so much that they threaten to fire him, charge him as a spy or destroy his code breaking machine. Turing avoid their threats by appealing directly to Churchill. In reality, Turing did appeal to Churchill successfully for a higher budget for his outfit, but the relationship between him and his immediate superiors was nowhere near as bad as the movie shows, 3) when Turing was arrested after the war for homosexuality, there was never any suspicion by the authorities that he might be a Soviet spy.In the phoniest scene in the movie, Turing and his coworkers decide not to tell their superiors that they have finally cracked Enigma, since they are afraid that if Germany realizes that the code has been broken, they then will switch it to a harder code. This is made despite the tearful pleadings of one of the code breakers whose brother happens to be in a ship about to be taken down by German submarines. Decisions like this were actually made during the war, but they were taken at the highest military and political level, not by the cryptoanalysts.In the most ridiculous scene in the movie: Turing realizes that one of his fellow code breakers, named John Cairncross (played by Allen Leech), is a Soviet spy. He discovers this when he see he has a bible with a passage marked that has been used in a message by a mole. Cairncross tells Turing that if he blows his cover, he will tell Turing's superiors that he is homosexual, and Turing gives in to this blackmail. There was actually a Soviet mole named John Cairncross in Bletchley Park, Britain's wartime code breaking facility, but he never worked alongside Turing, and might never have met him.Turing was a remarkable figure, a scientific genius, a privately tormented person, who also did extremely valuable work during World War II. It is sad that his story is finally brought to screen (after so many decades) through such a terrible movie. The real story of Turing and the decipherment of the Enigma machine can be found in many places, either in books, TV documentaries or in the Internet. I suggest a fine book by Simon Singh called 'The Code Book'.Also with Keira Knightley, who plays a codebreaker who was for a time engaged to Turing - this was actually true.",2,25,38,7 February 2015
Prisoners," Starts well but ends up being tiresome and exhausting
","In a small town in Pennsylvania, two families get together to celebrate Thanksgiving. But during the night, their two young daughters disappear without a trace. A hunt is put forward, and the only suspect seems to be a retarded man who was in a RV outside the house at the time. He is detained and soon released for lack of evidence, but the hothead father of one of the girls (Hugh Jackman, in a spectacular performance) decides to pursue the man and eventually kidnaps and tortures him in order to get information. But this is just the beginning, since there is almost two hours more of film.This thriller seems very exciting at the hour point, but in the latter part descends into a tiresome series of twists and dead herrings. By the time the running time of two hours and a half has past, the audience is exhausted. The movie also suffers from serious leaps in logic and even basic continuity (WARNING: I will reveal some spoilers now): 1) when the retarded man is detained, the house where he lives with his aunt is apparently never thoroughly searched though it will turn out to be the place where the girls were held captive, 2) when other suspect kills himself in the police station, this is news in the local newspaper, but one policeman investigating the case is apparently unaware of it, 3) this whole subplot with the seeming suspect played by David Dastmalchian is never fully explained (and how he got a gun to kill himself?), 4) I find it unbelievable that the other parent (Terrence Howard) agrees to torture the suspect.Maria Bello gives a fine performance as the troubled wife of Jackman. So does Jake Gyllenhall as the main detective.",6,1,1,8 December 2013
The Dark Knight," Good, but not a masterpiece
","I was surprised by the very high ratings this film has in IMDb. Movie critics generally rated this sky high as well. The matter is, this movie has some fine action scenes (though far from the best you will see in a movie theater) but it is also ridiculously and relentlessly serious. Maybe this has to do with me growing up with the campy Adam West TV series, but, come on, how can a movie be so somber, solemn and humorless when, at the end of the day, the story is about a guy wearing a bat suit. The performances are so so; Bale and Eckhart are OK, Caine and Oldman are underused, Gyllenhaal fails to make an impression. As the psychotic Joker, the late Heath Ledger is genuinely scary, though the constant facial tics makes one wonder if he wasn't under the influence of illegal substances when he was performing (Ledger died of a drug overdose). And a lot of the plot just doesn't make sense (how the Oldman character was able to save his life, what happened with Eckhart and the Joker in the hospital, how the Joker is able to plot so many things all alone, almost always being one step ahead of the police). While I would recommend this, I just can't call it a masterpiece.",6,4,12,23 July 2008
Elysium," Entertaining sci fi with political undertones
","This film by the South African director Neil Blomkamp is set in 2154, in an Earth that has become a planet wide slum.

Matt Damon stars as Max, who lives in a completely Mexicanized Los Angeles, and is on his death throes after being exposed to radiation in a factory accident. He wants to infiltrate Elysium in order to cure himself (the residents of Elyisum has cutting edge medical technology able t o cure all ailments which is denied to the inhabitants of the Earth) and to do that he decides to work for a bunch of gangsters. Though the political undertones and the metaphors of the movies are a bit obvious, the film is entertaining and well done. Many critics have interpreted this movie as a left wing screed, but it could be easily seen as a right wing pamphlet, in which the end of civilization is blamed at the uncontrolled influx of immigrants.",8,0,1,5 October 2013
The Artist," Warm, entertaining homage to silent cinema
","This French made homage to silent movies is a bit of a gimmick, being a silent movie itself, but is extremely well made. It would be easy to dismiss it as an amusing stunt, but director Michel Hazanavicius's hand is so sure and his actors so engaging that the movie deservedly won an Oscar for best picture. We are in 1927 and George Valentin (Jean Dujardin), the artist of the title, is a leading man of the silent cinema who is about to hit it tough when talking movies arrive. Bérénice Bejo (an Argentine born actress who is married to Hazanavicius in real life) is the perky, spunky Peppy, an irresistible starlet who rises to fame at the same time that Valentin falls. Also costarring are John Goodman as a Hollywood mogul and James Cromwell as George Valentin's butler (they are all very fine). The authentic Los Angeles locations, the reconstruction of the 1920s and the extraordinary photography help a lot. My only complaint, is that the happy ending seems quite weak, a bit of a concession to the public, given what went on before, though, of course, a sad ending would probably be even more disappointing.",9,3,6,5 January 2014
Invictus," Disappointing
","The story of how Nelson Mandela, after becoming the leader of South Africa following the demise of the apartheid regime, tried to heal the racially divided country by, among other things, supporting the Springboks, the South African rugby team, who were supported by the white minority and hated by blacks, during the 1995 World Cup (the Springboks managed to win). Matt Damon does a nice turn as Francois Pienaar, the captain of the Springbooks, who coming like the rest of his teammates from an Afrikaner home hostile to the new regime slowly warms up to Mandela. Morgan Freeman is almost insufferable as the new president, showing him almost as a holy fool, a naive, always smiling, quasi imbecile. The real Mandela, who was (for a good cause) the leader of Africa's main armed faction for more than thirty years, is probably made of sterner stuff. You don't have to be a cynic to find this movie trite and corny, full of cringing dialogue that is almost painful to listen. Even the rugby scenes shown here are uninspiring. A disappointment.",4,0,2,5 August 2010
A Clockwork Orange," Landmark even if not perfect film
","Justly regarded as a landmark film, this disturbing and violent movie by Stanley Kubrick – stunningly filmed and still shocking after forty years - has been so talked about and over analyzed that there is probably not much more to say. But let me add a few thoughts about A Clockwork Orange, after having recently seen it again after perhaps some twenty years.First, the movie has three clear and differentiated acts. In the first act, we see Alex and his gang commit outrageous acts of violence, rape and eventually murder against helpless citizens in a futuristic London. In the second act, Alex is caught and sent to prison, where he is 'cured' through an aversion method called the Ludovico technique (involving basically the infliction of pain and nausea on Alex when he is forced to see violent acts in a movie). The third act sees Alex being released back into society, supposedly cured, but he will find it impossible to reintegrate himself to society. If the first act is a clear masterpiece (perhaps the best thing that Kubrick ever made), and the second act is very powerful, the third act I found wanting. It's as if Kubrick (or for that matter, author Anthony Burgess) wasn't very sure about how to wrap the story or what particular message he wanted to give forward.Lastly, and about the message of the film, there has been some debate on whether this is a right wing (conservative) film or is it a left wing (liberal) film. My feeling is that it cannot be put safely in any of the two categories. Kubrick was too idiosyncratic a director to be put into a neat ideological label. Thus, while the movie's radical critique of contemporary western society might put it in the left category, its skepticism that criminals can be 'cured', can be seen as a conservative position. Also conservative might be its skepticism about whether any government bureaucracy can have good intentions toward the people.",8,1,2,16 September 2012
The Wind that Shakes the Barley," Great movie about Irish War of Independence
","A movie about the Anglo-Irish war and the subsequent Irish Civil War told from a strongly pro-republican point of view. Cillian Murphy plays Damien, an apolitical Irish student, planning to become a doctor in London, who after witnessing the English brutal repression of Irish independence, decides to join his brother in the armed struggle to liberate Ireland from the English yoke. Director Ken Loach is certainly not among the most fluid of filmmakers, his movie is sometimes didactic, but is also consistently informative and interesting (it certainly lead me to look more information about this historical period on the Internet). The beautiful actress Orla Fitzgerald, playing Murphy's girlfriend, adds to the movie's appeal. The movie ends in a sad note: when the terms of the peace fails to conform the more belligerent Irish republicans (who particularly objected to the required oath to the King), the civil war erupts, and it ends up putting (literally) brother against brother. All in all, a highly recommended film.",8,0,6,5 April 2007
Ice Age," Enjoyable and well done animated film
","A very enjoyable animated feature, whose plot is loosely based on 1948's classic western from John Ford Three Godfathers. Set during (of course) the last Ice Age, the story has a mammoth called Manny, an annoying sloth named Sid and a duplicitous saber tiger called Diego finding a dying human mother along with her baby. They decide to return the infant to their tribe, against all odds, and facing a series of predators (especially saber tigers, who count on Diego on helping them on the inside). Punctuating the plot, a squirrel tries to save an acorn in a series of very funny vignettes. And a running joke is that the only species that do not talk during the movie are human beings. Unfortunately, the graphics are a bit below standard (they are no match for Pixar's works). The sequel has better graphics but a far less interesting plot (though it has a very funny final scene).",8,1,1,4 March 2008
Downfall," The definitive film about Hitler's last days
","A German film about the last days of the Nazi regime, centered on the Fuhrer's bunker, from his 56th birthday on April 20th, 1945 to the fall of Berlin on May 8th. This is certainly a very compelling story (certainly one of the most important stories of the 20th century) and while it has been filmed before, it is the first time it's done in the German language. This makes the movie look far more authentic than when someone like Anthony Hopkins or Alec Guinness played an English speaking Fuhrer. And it has a neat framing device in the story as seen by Hitler's young secretary Traudl Junge. The more compelling parts of the movie, for me, are not the war scenes, but the discussions Hitler has with his closest aides and military staff: Jodl, Krebs, Burgdorf, Keitel, Speer, Wiedling, Mohnke. Most of them know the situation is extremely critical, but they are reluctant to tell the Fuhrer, who is increasingly in denial, promising final victory even after the Russians are only a few kilometers away from his headquarters. Only Goebbels remains completely wedded to the Fuhrer's autistic vision. Even Himmler and Goering, realizing the desperate situation of the Reich try to unsuccessfully arrange negotiations with the allies. These negotiations never got to anything, but Hitler is furious when he learns about them, and consider them both traitors. Bruno Ganz is brilliant as Hitler, but the movie is considerably helped by the strengths of its many characters. For example, Fegelein, who as Himmler's adjutant, tries to convince Hitler and the other people in the bunker that it's best to leave Berlin. Fegelein meets an untimely fate and has become the subject of many internet gags (more on that later). Or Eva Braun, portrayed here as the ultimate dumb blond totally subservient to his man. Or Magda Goebbels, who can be both cold and hysterical. Perhaps the only character whose portrayal is unsatisfying is Joseph Goebbels, since he is played by an actor in a heavy and ridiculous white make up. Also strange is the decision to have Goering appear in only one scene and without a speaking role, just looking impatiently at his watch. I remember that when the movie came out, some critics thought the movie was pro Nazi, in that it understood Hitler too much. I think with time it is clear that this charge is ridiculous. This movie clearly shows the delusion of Hitler and the terrible philosophy of the Nazis: no compassion and ultimate indifference to the fate of their own people. One criticism is that perhaps the movie was a bit too long: most of the scenes involving the bald doctor in the hospital or the child soldiers could have been cut and the movie would have been better. Of course, by now the movie is well known by the hundreds (if not thousands) of parody videos in the Internet where the original audio is retained but the subtitles are changed so that Hitler and his aides end up arguing about a lot of ridiculous and anachronistic subjects (like computer programs, sport teams, pop stars, whatever). Those videos are sometimes very funny (and they have been surprisingly resilient in time given the short attention span of fads in the web), but if the movie on which they are based was not powerful, they couldn't have thrived as they did.",9,0,1,12 January 2011
The Wolf of Wall Street," Well acted and with an interesting subject matter, but too long, repetitive and unpleasant
","A biopic directed by Martin Scorsese about the rise and fall of one Jordan Belfort, a Wall Street stock broker who founded in the 1980s a brokerage firm that centered on selling penny stocks using high pressure tactics to small investors. He was indicted for fraud in 1998 and was sentenced for a relatively lenient 22 months in prison. The amoral, drug addicted Belfort is played by Leonardo Di Caprio (this is his fifth film for Scorsese); Jonah Hill is Belfort's main sidekick, Donnie. The Australian actress Margot Robbie is great as the blond bombshell - dumb model - trophy second wife of Belfort. Rob Reiner has an unnecessary extended cameo as Belfort's father. Though the subject matter is certainly interesting and the acting is fine, this film, despite its undeniable brio, is also quite unpleasant with its three hour non stop show of drug use and sordid sex. The movie is very repetitive: we see sex, drug use, a joke involving oral sex, sex, drug use, etc. Moreover, the movie has no characters one can sympathize â€“ everybody is extremely unpleasant (well, maybe with the exception of the FBI agent played by Kyle Chandler, but he appears in the screen for only a little time). Jean Dujardin (the silent movie star from The Artist) has a nice cameo as a venal, corrupt Swiss banker.",5,14,27,4 January 2014
Defiance," Very interesting film about fascinating, little known story
","A very interesting film about the real life story of the Bielski brothers, who after barely escaping the massacre of their family by the Germans in Belorussia during World War II, moved to the nearby forest and formed a Jewish militia. Soon many more refugees join in (including women, children and elderly people) and the group reached the low thousands. With some aid from the Soviets, they successfully survived the war and even fought back in a number of occasions the German attacks (though apparently they did not engage in combat in real life as much as it appears in the film, very wisely, given the disproportion of forces between the two sides). Daniel Craig is a perfect in the role of Tuvia Bielski, who as the elder of the brothers was the commander of the militias. Much of the humor in the movie is the contrast between the tough guy nature of the two elder Bielski brothers and the far more intellectual demeanor of the rest of the group, most of them urban professional types who for the first time in their life have to learn how to survive in the forest. Though the film is somewhat conventional in its narrative, it is nevertheless both fascinating and beguiling. The beautiful, haunting forest where they hid is another attraction to the movie (the film was shot in Lithuania, next door to Belorussia where the action took place). It is somewhat surprising this story was never brought to the screen in sixty something years (this probably have to do with the low profile that the Bielski brothers choose for themselves after the war as well as for the fact that their alliance with the Red Army made their saga somewhat politically uncomfortable during the Cold War).",8,2,5,8 August 2009
The Good Shepherd," Surprisingly good movie about the origins of the CIA
","A solid movie about the early history of the CIA. Robert De Niro is not among the most fluid of filmmakers, but his movie is consistently informative and interesting. The movie is surprisingly balanced, neither blindly apologetic of the CIA nor wildly condemnatory. De Niro even plays a small role, as a General based on Bill Donovan, the founder of the OSS (the characters in these movie are all thinly veiled portraits of real people but with different names). The protagonist in the movie is Edward Wilson, played by Matt Damon and clearly inspired by James Jesus Angleton (the counterintelligence chief at the CIA for many years). Though the fact that Angleton was half Mexican is omitted here, most of his professional life appears here: his early life as a student of poetry in Yale, his role in World War II as an intelligence officer, his relationship with Kim Philby (who goes here by the name of Arch Cummings, and is played, against type, by Billy Crudrup), his role in the Golitsyn-Nosenko affair. He also appears as having a role in two operations he wasn't directly involved: the 1953 coup against Guatemalan president Jacobo Arbenz and the 1961 failed invasion of Bay of Pigs. One of the few flaws of the movie is its try at amateur psychology by having Wilson's motivations be based on the suicide of his father (something which did not happen in Angleton's case). But this is, overall, a fine movie, especially if you are interested in its subject matter.",8,2,4,7 April 2007
Centurion," Nothing extraordinary but enjoyable adventure film
","Acceptable adventure film of the sword and sandals genre, set in Roman Britain, has some Roman soldiers, survivors from a massacre against the bloody Pict tribes, fleeing behind enemy lines. Historically dubious (the ragtag platoon includes, seemingly for PC reasons and ludicrously from a historical point of view, a black roman soldier), this violent and bloody, muscular and masculine film is, for all its flaws, certainly entertaining. I found this better and more enjoyable than the recent, similarly themed Eagle of the Ninth. The pristine, misty Scottish outdoors where this movie was filmed certainly helps. Acting is not the main point of this movie, as the actors have to put up with some terse, rough lines. Michael Fassbender, who was fine in the more recent X-Men film, fails to make much of an impression here as the top Roman soldier here, but Ukrainian model Olga Kurylenko, is surprisingly OK as the top warrioress of the Picts.",7,1,3,27 August 2011
The Water Diviner," A triumph for Russell Crowe in his directing debut
","Russell Crowe, who also directed (this is his debut at the helm), plays Connor, an Australian farmer whose specialty is finding water beneath the land – thus the title. His three sons have died in 1915's battle of Gallipolli, and after his distraught wife commits suicide, he decides to go to Turkey to recover their bones or at least to know their fate. We are now in 1919, the First World War has just ended, but not for Turkey, who has seen its capital Constantinople occupied by Western forces, while its Aegean coast have been invaded by Greece (Greeks are the bad guys in this movie, in one scene they are shown killing defenseless Turkish villagers and in another they treacherously attack Turkish patriots on a train). The English forces are lukewarm to Connor in his quest for his son's remains, but he finds an unlikely help in a Turkish major (played with dignity by Yilmaz Erdogan) who fought on the other side in the battle and thus has a good idea of the circumstances of the deaths of Connor's sons. While in Constantinople, Connor finds lodging in a nice boutique hotel run by the beautiful Ayshe (played believably by the Ukrainian model Olga Kurylenko), whose Turkish husband, we eventually learn, has also presumably died in Gallipolli. Connor and Ayshe starts getting close to each other, though no doubt in deference to Turkish sensibilities, the relationship between Connor and Ayshe is never shown as consummated (and frankly, given the conservatism at the time of Turkish society, would it have been believable for an Australian national to have a romantic relationship with an Ottoman woman during this period?)The movie is not perfect, but it has many praiseworthy aspects, including a wonderful photography and a careful reconstruction of Constantinople, down to the crowded, narrow streets where veiled women and men in their traditional Turkish hats hassled. The film does hit at least a couple of false notes: one particular scene, that I found jarring, has the Crowe character and Ayshe's brother in law (who wishes to marry her and occupy his late brother's place) get into a fist fight over her. The other scene that I did not like, which I won't reveal in detail, appears near the end and it has to do with the ultimate resolution of Connor's quest for his sons. But despite these particular shortcomings, this is an accomplished debut by Crowe.",8,4,8,31 May 2015
Her," Has some things to recommend for it, though a bit overrated
","In the Los Angeles of perhaps a couple of decades into the future (a strangely aseptic metropolis dominated by high rises), Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix), a middle aged nerdy guy, who works in an office and has recently divorced his wife (played by Rooney Mara) tries to alleviate his loneliness by getting an operating system, that is a computer which one can communicate with its voice (voiced here by Scarlett Johansson). Not only the operating system (who calls itself or herself Samantha) is super smart, 'she' is also more empathetic than any other human being. The conversation that Theodore has with Samantha is superior to that he has to any other humans. Eventually, Theodore hits it so well with Samantha, that they start a 'relationship' (by the way, does Samantha have real feelings or is 'she' faking them? The movie never really tells though by the end of the film it does seem the latter). The movie has a lot of things to recommend for it (its design, some of the performances, though not in my opinion that of Joaquin Phoenix). However, I have to say that I found the film wanting. Director Spike Jonze became famous more than a decade ago with a couple of movies ('Adaptation' and 'Being John Malkovich') that were widely praised by critics but which I found boring and pretentious. This film is certainly a step up from those movies, but is not enough for me. Perhaps the movie has something to say about loneliness in our modern, technological age, but what the movie says doesn't look very profound (in fact, the movie works better if you think about it as a parody of romantic comedies) and is cut down by the inane immaturity of most of its characters, including Samantha.",6,2,5,21 January 2014
Slumdog Millionaire," Not great - but far better than it sounds
","On the face of it, this British made film (winner of a best picture Oscar) sounds a terrible mixture of unbelievable melodrama, full of improbable coincidences, and western condescension. A teenage boy, raised on India's awful slums, manage to win millions in a tacky quiz show by answering all the questions, neither of them terrible hard. He knows the answers, not from having read about them, but from having learned in life about them (for example, he knows who invented the revolver from a shootout he was once involved). From the first scene, where the protagonist is tortured with electric wires to find out if he's a cheat, to the very end, when his lifelong female friend crosses a busy street to reach a cell phone in order to tell him in extremis the answer that will let him win the show, the whole film is ridiculous, sentimental, manipulative, condescending...and yet, this film is nowhere as bad as it sounds, and despite all its low punches, it is eminently watchable. Maybe this has to do with the actor's earnest performances, but this film ends up reaching a deeper emotional chord than it should have. Recommended with reservations.",6,2,4,8 March 2009
The Pursuit of Happyness," Great movie inspired on a real life story
","The Pursuit of Happiness is the true life story of Chris Gardner, who was a struggling salesman of medical scanners in the 1980s. His life hit the doldrums when his wife left him, and he has to take care of his young son. Soon he is evicted from his house and has to sleep with his son in a public bathroom (and later on homeless shelters). A small light at the end of the tunnel appears when he is accepted as an unpaid intern at a stock brokerage firm - he is one of 20 such interns, and only one will be chosen after six months to join the company in a lucrative job. Meanwhile, he has to make ends meet with his young son as he best can, facing debts, evictions, bills, etc. Some people criticize the movie as being too pro capitalist. There is some truth to that, as the rich guys who head the stock brokerage firm are shown to be all nice men, while the poor (with the exception of Chris) are bitter, resentful, unhappy with their lives. Yet, the movie also shows realistically what is to be a poor man in America as very few Hollywood movies do. All in all, a very good movie.",9,0,0,1 February 2007
Valkyrie," Gripping WW2 film despite some flaws
","A good film about the Von Stauffenberg plot, the conspiracy that almost succeeded in killing Adolf Hitler during the later stages of World War II. It doesn't start very promisingly: things happen fast (we have Von Stauffenberg severely injured in a battle in North Africa, losing an arm, three fingers and an eye, and a few minutes later we have him joining the conspiracy, without explaining very well his motivations) and characters are introduced hastily without explaining well who they are. But as the movie progresses and we get into the plot itself (which was more than about killing the Fuhrer; knowing that that wouldn't be enough to end Germany's dreadful situation, they also have a complicated plan to take power and be able to sue the allies for peace in terms that would not be disastrous for Germany), it gets more and more gripping with a superb final hour. The mostly British cast here (among them, Terence Stamp, Kenneth Branagh, Tom Wilkinson and Bill Nighy), acquit themselves very well. Tom Cruise, however, while not a disaster, is just not very believable as a German officer. Besides his limited acting range, his demeanor has always been very American, so he is just not very believable playing people from other countries. I can think of other actors who could have been great in this role: for example, Thomas Kretschmann, who plays a Major who has a key role in breaking the coup attempt, could have been a great Von Stauffenberg. Still, this was better than expected as director Bryan Singer (of the X-Men franchise) certainly knows how to make a gripping, entertaining movie. And the movie includes also some terrific aviation scenes using period planes.",7,0,0,3 March 2011
Atonement," Somewhat disappointing
","Despite the critical accolades and awards, I found this movie quite disappointing. Based on a novel by Ian McEwan, and directed by Joe Wright (who had filmed the latest movie version of Pride and Prejudice, much inferior to the BBC miniseries), the bulk of the movie occurs in a British country house during one day in the mid 1930s, in which a crime might have happened of might have just been the figment of the imagination of a fevered child. The main characters will feel for years the consequences of what happened that day. Since I'm totally uninterested on the life of England's upper classes, I was quite bored during a lot of the movie. And as if that wasn't enough, the final twist of the movie (in which Vanessa Redgrave has a cameo role) is totally insulting, and makes the viewer feels cheated. The engaging presence of Keira Knightley and newcomer Saoirse Ronan are among the movie's few assets. On the other hand, the much praised scene set during the evacuation at Dunkirk is very show-offy in my opinion.",5,2,5,9 March 2008
