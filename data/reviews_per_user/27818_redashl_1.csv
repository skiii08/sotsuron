The Lobster," WHAT A FILM!!!
","It is really refreshing to see a film of this nature, I believe that Yorgos Lanthimos has really something to say as a filmmaker even though i have only seen this one and the killing of a sacred deer which i found quite brilliant. the best aspect of this film is the dialogue which is hilariously dark, witty and DAMN weird.",9,0,1,12 June 2019
