Hereditary," My expectations were too high
","The only reason I went to see this was because Toni Collette was in it. I will not get into specifics of the storyline, etc...I have no complaints about the acting, directing, cinematography, sound effects etc..... It was all good, actually very good.My chief complaint is the ending. It was a letdown. I really enjoy a true twist at the end, that leaves me speechless. Towards the end of the film, you are basically given the ending when Annie is going through her mothers things and there is a close up of an open book that basically tells you what is happening.I was one of the people that was fooled all the way until the end of 'The Sixth Sense', so unfortunately my measuring stick was pretty high.Not unhappy that I saw it. This was a must see for me.",5,2,4,19 June 2018
