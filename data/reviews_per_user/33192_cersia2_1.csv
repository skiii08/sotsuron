National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Where's the bad guy?
","I loved the first movie but this sequel simply *missed* the motivational villain. But what can you expect when everyone in this sequel when the main characters are suppose to be 'rich', except for Riley of course. I quote my husband as to 'why are they having a car chase in London?' I simply answered...'I don't know.' At least the villain in the first National Treasure tried to figure out clues and paid people to give up letters to a puzzle, this villain simply leaned back and let Gates do everything for him. Which admittedly was not as appealing as to wondering if he would figure out the clue before Gates did. The motivation of the villain simply wasn't all that plausible. I mean come on, I'm sure if he'd approached Gates as a fellow treasure hunter to look for Gates would have helped him. So the villain was unimpressive.And then there was the BS story about Ciablo(sp). Whoever wrote that piece of lore needs to take a lesson in geography and Native American tribal relations. How did the Queen of England know about some vital abstract part of a Native American folklore when they couldn't even read the symbols on the planks?! Then there was the total disregard for a 'national treasure' at the end as the 'scientists' started to dismantle Native American artifacts as if studying them onsite isn't an acceptable practice. BS! I'm one for suspension of belief while watching a movie...well in this movie its so outrageous that even with my over active imagination I found it hard to disbelieve.",4,6,8,6 June 2008
