The Blair Witch Project," worst movie ever made.
","I'm embarrassed to say I actually paid to see this garbage. Horrible. Why this movie garnished any positive reviews astounds me. The acting was putrid, but I suppose it was meant to be that way. Nothing like a wobbly camera and running around in circles to get my interest piqued. Then again there was the 'up the runny nose scene'. Great stuff. The story was boring and not the least bit scary. The only good part was the final few minutes, but sadly it was too little too late. The internet hype created this abomination and the fact Roger Ebert gave this thing 4 stars proves he'd lost it as a movie reviewer. If I ever fall for movie hype again, I couldn't be as disappointed as I was when I first viewed this piece of crap. I'd rather see a 24 hour marathon of 'Gigli' than sit through another viewing of Blair Witch.",1,1,3,28 July 2007
Wonder Woman," Good movie, not perfect but certainly worth watching
","Everybody has an opinion so I make it a point to read both good and bad movie reviews on this site. 'Wonder Woman' was not perfect, so few movies made today are. I can agree with the 1 star rating naysayers on a point or two as it indeed needed a little more action, the CGI is pretty obvious at times and it did contain a bit of the obligatory Hollywood commentary on the current state of modern society. Having said that, none of the above made this movie unwatchable. In fact, it was quite good.However, the poster who claimed Gil Gadot is less attractive than Lynda Carter has lost his mind, or at the very least, his eye sight. Lynda Carter was/is a beautiful actress, but she can't polish Gadot's magic wrist bands. The Israeli actress is a wonder to look at and her acting in 'Wonder Woman' was good enough. Good flick. Go see it.",8,3,7,3 June 2017
