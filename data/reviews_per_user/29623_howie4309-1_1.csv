Raiders of the Lost Ark," An outstanding adventure that could only be told by Speilberg
",This movie brought back all the childhood memories I had watching the old cliffhangers and the Saturday afternoon serials in the 40s and 50s. Speilberg is my favorite Director.  Harrison Ford was the perfect Indiana Jones. I enjoyed all 3 of the Indiana series and am looking forward to the next one in 2004.,10,0,0,7 January 2003
