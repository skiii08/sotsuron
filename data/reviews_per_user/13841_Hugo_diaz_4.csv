The Ring," A clear example of how real scary movies are going to be in the future.
","SpoilersI realize this is not an original movie, I was very impressed with this version, though. When I say impressed, I really mean it. I still have disturbing dreams about Tv-sets, long dark hair little girls or wild horses.The only flaw (my humble opinion) would be the imperative need to use the editing process in order to create a deep impact in the audience. I think there is a big challenge to change so in the future. However I also think that 'The Ring' can be a perfect example of how real scary movies are going to be in the future. If we think about The Exorcist for instance, and how less interesting must be for a whole nintendo-generation despite all of the devil references. In short, the question to ask would be:  How can you scare 21st century people who can't be scared with anything at all?, people who are got used to live among winds of war, murderers, etc.Maybe the answer would be: Suspense, no visual effects, fear to unknown things. Because the worst evil, the ugliest monster exists within our own minds. No art designer, make up artist, or screen writer will ever be able to compete with that. M. Night Shyamalan understood so already. I think 'The Ring' type of film is the next step.I'm not an easy-to-scare guy. That's why I always feel a bit embarrassed when I remembered I let a scream out in the theater, while I was witnessing the last sequence of this film.The last ten minutes of 'The Ring' has the most scary images I've ever suffered in my whole life. I ask my money back going out the cinema because I was shocked.

Cloverfield," Totally underestimated!!!
","I think I understand why this movie is so underestimated. It is clear that we have not seen a truly re-invention in a long time and many viewers doesn't know how to react. And the thing is, all the main good reviews and press notice that this film has received are not for nothing. All the praises have been given by people, I mean critics, who actually knows a lot about cinema and storytelling, characters development, etc.I am not saying this is a sort of citizen Kane, just referring to the fact that the form, the way this movie has been made, may distract from the substance and the value this piece has as a drama.Marlena, for instance, is a great character, and it totally shows a lot of work in his creation and performance.I think this film should be called 'Cleverfield', because it is not just a success regarding marketing campaign (the filmmakers actually create a parallel universe), but also as an entertaining film.It impressed me, and not because of 'the monster'. It simply took me by surprise in a good way.",9,1,2,10 February 2008
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," One ring to bring us all to an incredible world...
","I went to the theater for 'The Fellowship...' with the highest expectations I've ever had about a movie, because of the enormous quantity of adds and news about this historical event film. Three hours later, I had noticed that the movie had ended and I was almost crying. It was beyond my expectations...I felt like I was floating.It is the perfect combination of a Hollywood Big-Budgeted production, with a small independent movie vision. And you really, I mean REALLY, can tell that it was made with a great love to the amazing work of Mr. J.R.R. Tolkien.I'm not going to tell you any spoilers, or if it is an excellent motion picture or just good or anything. It is my duty to inform you: You SHOULD see it. Period.",10,0,0,4 January 2002
Signs," Don not THINK about it. FEEL it and you'll understand...
","Perhaps Signs is not as good as The Sixth Sense, but definitively it's a great film. I think Shyamalan is a dare-filmmaker who has the ability to re-invent what a thriller should be. That's why this is a movie which can't be categorized.Spoilers.Has it got a few plot holes? Of course it has. If we try to compare it to some others ET motion pictures. But from the bottom that's not the issue.In order this movie works, the audience doesn't have to worry about logical things because something else is happening under their noses. Obviously Shyamalan is smart enough to understand the thing that an alien specie which neither can't break wooden doors nor drink a simple glass of water, but is capable of build spaceships, it's beyond absurdity.So is he stupid? There must be a reason. If this is a nonsense, why did I shiver watching a fictional breaking news report showing an also fictional Brazilian home-made video tape? Because it doesn't matter WHAT it's outside our homes. Only matters the fact of not knowing if our own lives are in danger. I've read some comments complaining of this apparently lack of logic, assuming bad portraits of alien technology or behavior. I think these persons need to think twice, for no spaceship is shown, no extraterrestrial culture is developed. They can't assume things as wrong just because they don't fit to Independence Day's codes. I know Superman is an alien, but I don't complain the fact he has one head instead of two. We simply don't know what sort of creatures they are, so we can't figure out anything. All exists in our imagination. We build it thanks to sounds and blinks.And this is brilliant, because anything could happen. Anything. It's better if something is suggested, because it all depends of people's imagination. Besides this film has no other intention but to tell the classic story of the man who looses himself and re encounter himself in a context of a supposed extraterrestrial invasion. It might have been presented as a world war flick, and the core of the story would have remained the same. Not Shyamalan best work, but an extraordinary picture without any doubts.",Null,0,1,20 October 2002
