Hereditary," Great potential, extremely disappointing
","I had been looking forward to seeing this movie for months, however it was nothing like what I had imagined it to be.It was a good movie that kept the interest alive, right until the girl's head came off. From that moment the movie just became worse.. and worse. And terrible. A lot of it did not make any sense to me whatsoever.I saw this in the cinema and people, including myself, were laughing. If I had wanted to laugh, I would have seen a comedy instead.",4,5,12,9 August 2018
