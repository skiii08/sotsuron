The Blair Witch Project," Pure Hype
","This movie is definately the worst film I have seen recently, if not the worst I have ever seen.  We all know that the trendy thing to do is whatever the media tells us, so like the good little androids we are, we all loved this movie.  Bull!!  There was nothing genuinely frightening about this all out scam on the American population.  At the very worst there is one jump and a couple of times where the hair on your neck might rise, but nothing ever happens.  This was the handy work of a marketing genius and a filmmaking novice.  We have all been told by critics and other agents of the media how good this movie is, and having invested our money and time in going to see it, we are afraid to admit we were duped.  Wake up America, you've been had.  If you want a scare, go rent The Exorcist.  This is a waste of your time and money.  I want my $7.50 and 90 minutes of my life back.",1,2,3,26 October 1999
