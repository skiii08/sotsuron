Requiem for a Dream," NO!
","This movie sets out to be realistic. If you wan`t to be realistic don`t rely on surreal trickery to get there. Most drug-scenes are bad. Badly acted out and overdone. The way it is done it should be a film about one persons struggle and not heeps of people struggling. The halusinations are bad, no one get`s these kinds of effects from taking speed(amfetamins). Not even woman wanting to loose weight. Silly film. Comedy. Ive seen real hard films before about drugs, they don`t rely on MTV-effects and CGI though. It is enough to show a good actor suffering. SCORE: 2 out of 10 for the effort",Null,1,2,2 December 2003
