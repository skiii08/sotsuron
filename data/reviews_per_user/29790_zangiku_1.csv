The Monuments Men," saccharine take on serious history
","an entertaining film about a fascinating fact of history which everyone should see for that reason. v.good acting & art direction, but the script stinks. sophomoric & loaded with stereotypes: ex-drunk ennobling himself by useless death; little funny cowardly guy who saves day with brains; sole female character, toughest guy on screen, suddenly morphing idiotically into sex-starved predator; guy so good & faithful that he turns her down! one tires of the continual adolescent philosophizing about Life VS Art, not to mention the unsubtle direct references to GC's beauty. perhaps most revolting is the final 'confrontation' between GC & the evil Nazi, apparently meant to give moral closure to the story, in which world Jewry is neatly symbolized by an onion bagel.for intrinsic interest of story, AD & atmosphere, fine acting from Blanchett, Murray & Goodman plus all the nasty Germans, this film is recommended. you may safely leave your brain at home, however.",7,1,3,10 November 2015
