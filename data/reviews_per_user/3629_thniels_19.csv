Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Ginger Rogers with at sword
","First of all, this movie should never have been split in two. It can't be said in less words less a few adverbs and I readily subtract 1 point for molesting it so.As for Uma Thurman she was nothing short of great but first and foremost she was believable. Not stunningly beautiful, nor out of this world gracious. Just plain real. And being that in a role like this is really something else. Not only must it require considerable talent, it also adds a depth to the character seemingly impossible considering the genre which is far from being realistic. As an odd aside, the genre best compared to is that of song-and-dance movies with Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers not as one would imagine the tacky kung-fu movies of the seventies. I wonder if my grandma would like it? Distinctly a Quentin Tarantino movie and a good one at that.<ul><li>Thomas Nielsen</li></ul>",8,1,3,23 April 2004
Shakespeare in Love," Oh, and there's a dog!
","Speculating on people's motives can often result in amusing stories, and indeed this one is. Lack of realism bordering the surreal makes for a focus on characters down to the minutest support, rarely seen in comedies and there really are a great number of interesting persons to be found. Well acted by most and brilliantly by some, this is a funny and compelling movie.",8,0,0,24 March 2003
The Others," What a twist! What an intelligent and surprising twist.
","It is impossible to explain what makes this movie a perfect thriller, or even to put it in its proper category, without spoiling it. Wonderful acting, effective (very much so, in fact) thrills and a wonderful, wonderful twist.I hopped and jumped when seeing it the first time and hopped and jumped when seeing it the second time. That is so great.<ul><li>Thomas Nielsen</li></ul>",8,0,1,15 February 2004
The Day After Tomorrow," A disaster movie - quite literally
","What is it with Hollywood? Why could this movie not have spanned a couple of years instead of a measly week? The catastrophe would have been just as big and the images just as spectacular, and both much more believable. What could have been a thought provoking warning simply degraded into the disaster voyeurism we had with similar movies from the late 70s and early 80s, minus the gory but often creative highlights. This, and a strange stereotype scientist apparently still alive and kicking in Hollywood today, makes this an impressive b-movie. The stereotype of strangely preoccupied nerds working in very small groups and utterly incapable of social interaction. Take a look around! To cement its status as a b-movie, we'll just add a bit of sunshine and patriotism at the end. Where's the bitter reasoning? Where are the morales? Where are all those things that sold this movie? And for technical quality, let's quote someone at the production stage: 'Wolves? Where do we get 5 live wolves? Hey, we'll CGI them and no one will never know'! Even a bunch of hearing impaired retired alsatians would have looked more real! Oh, and a tiny bus blocking a cargo ship? Anyone care to calculate the inertia of 50,000 tons of steel at walking speed? Not a whole lot of believability there. Outrunning a temperature drop? Operating cell phones in a complete wasteland? Active gas lines? Cross-Atlantic phone calls? An insult. A bloody insult!",5,0,1,14 January 2005
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Not at all up to what could be expected of a must-see installment
","Christopher Lee is good as always as our main villain and Ian McDiarmid could have been had he not been such a dead giveaway Emperor to-be. That is what can be said about this movie. The characters are narrow (the term Hamill-acting gets a new meaning here) and the surroundings a display of the effects department rather than a story foundation. The effects are often stunning but mostly cartoon like and utterly unconvincing. CGI characters much too often do not blend in like they should but become obvious inserts. All in all not at all up to what could be expected of a must-see installment. Entertaining, though, it is.",6,0,1,29 November 2003
The Matrix Revolutions," Where are the extras?
","The Matrix was good. It had a fair amount of innovative effects put to good use on an interesting plot. It even had an inhabited virtual world. With Reloaded and Revolutions two things went wrong. The effects were less convincing, even though Smith was a load of fun, and there were practically no people in the virtual world - only Smiths, cars and buildings. Where's the fun in that? As for effects; sometimes they degraded to computer game quality - for instance: When Neo fought single opponents you could see him breathe and even lose his breath (poor physical condition would show more when fighting a zillion suits, wouldn't it?). In scenes where he fought many opponents and in particular Smith & Co., he was completely void of expression as was his opponents. He even lacked the poor shave otherwise characterizing his character. Talk about effects standing out like the proverbial thumb. Oh, and I haven't even mentioned the completely ridiculous massive effect overload in the war scenes - please! Following up on The Matrix should've been forbidden by higher powers. And watching the trilogy in one sitting doesn't add to the positives, I might add.",5,0,0,25 November 2005
"I, Robot"," I doubt
","Not one bit true to Isaac Asimov's dystopian tales and in every other aspect merely disappointing. Characters are stereotype, too few to make an interesting world and for the better part poorly cast. The CGI effect, while occationally very convincing, mostly fail completely, even degrading to the point of the amateurish. This could have been a great movie but turned out to be another hit'n run production.By the way, why is it that all film makers seem to think that car companies don't use car designers in the future? Oh, and where did the cat go?<ul><li>Thomas Nielsen</li></ul>",5,0,0,23 August 2004
Dark City," A good starter...
","*** POSSIBLE SPOILERS *** Terry Gilliam definitely hasn't lived in vain. This was a wonderful tribute to the man who gave us Brazil and 12 Monkeys and boy, did it work. Dark and confusing. Quite a mystery... then it flunked! When our hero realizes their whereabouts, breaking the outer wall, the movie should have stopped and let us feel miserable. It didn't - it kept on letting him save the world. Where are the signs I missed? Why did John Murdoch have telepathic powers superior to the Strangers? Why did Emma/Anna stand alone at the pier? She couldn't have a memory of it since it had only just been created - as had Shell Beach. No, the last 20 minutes spoiled an otherwise brilliant movie. An excellent movie, in fact.",8,0,1,20 February 2003
Ratatouille," Their finest hour
","Bambi was beautifully drawn but failed somewhat on the story side. This one didn't, and it moved me just as much. The word plot makes no sense - this one had a story. Okay, a bit sentimental at times but it managed to stay away from some obvious pitfalls - I will not mention them - they will be dead obvious when you see them - or rather when you expect them and they don't happen.Technically this is some of the finest rendering seen in... well sort of ever. It doesn't take away the cartoon heart of the movie. It is still an animated movie; also in style. But there are moments where you almost say 'aha!'... 'they are mixing...' and you realize they are not. Remy holds a piece of bread at one point... it was so beautifully done it was beyond description. Not only did it look real - it look downright delicious. The attention to detail is simply out of this world. Animation is smooth and lifelike mixed with a dash of rosemary... I mean with a dash of Tex Avery and there were times when the audience were flat with laughter over scenes that had nothing but wacky moves to carry the moment.The movie of the year! It had it all! The only reason I still give Bambi one more star is because I have seen it so many more times than this. I have put Ratatouille on my wish list for Christmas and hope it will be out in due time. Then I might move it forward that last star...",9,1,4,4 November 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Grandiose, but still no songs
","They did it again. Still an amazing show and images that so much look what I have envisioned in my mind for 20 years. Still, I miss the songs. They are such a central part of the books that I simply can't comprehend how they could have missed even one tiny song. Okay, Gollum gets to sing a bit, but not one bards tale in three hours.As so many others have noted, the battle of Helms Deep kept us on the edge of our seats even though we all know what the outcome is. Frightfully thrilling, I must say.Trees do not grow that tall, though. The oliphants and the wolves disappointed me. There is no doubt in my mind, that the oliphants Sam is so fascinated with must have been elephants as we all know them. The awe with which he looks at them is only funny if indeed they were. And the wolves. Oh boy. They looked like overgrown steel wool fured hyena. Also, albeit a minor glitch, the animation was unnatural at times, revealing computer animated characters.Still, this is difficult to top. How on Earth are they going to make Return of The King parallel this in excellence? Half of the story there is a slow descent to normal life in the Shire which easily comes to look like an anticlimax in a hard paced movie. I simply can't wait.",10,0,0,18 December 2002
I Am Legend," How marvelous and how disappointingly sappy
","Matheson's novel was, eh, novel in at least two senses: it devoodoolised vampires and tried to put some science into the mythical creatures' being. This book of his, by the way, was not the only one doing this. But that is another story. The movie honored this part extremely well leaving out only tiny bits. Where the movie fails blatantly and inexcusably is on the second point, some three quarters in: The point that actually made the book stand out...*** here comes the a possible spoiler *** ...was our protagonist's status as a legend not among survivors but among vampires, effectively letting him become the Dracula of the story, completely twisting the sympathy the reader has come to get for him as it becomes evident that the vampires are the true heirs to the world.Nice effects. Very (very, very) effective acting, I must say! But very little to boast about as the credits start rolling.",7,1,2,20 December 2007
Event Horizon," Horrendous scenery
","And I like it. I consider myself a sci-fi fan and yet I fail to see the how this, as so many others seem to do, is not a sci-fi movie. It is definitely cheaply set but still quite effectively. What I liked so much is the fact that it doesn't look like every other sci-fi movie and actually becomes quite scary. There are, of course, certain flaws and among them is the lack of explanation. All too much happens without apparent reason. Simply writing it off as subliminal fear is too easy. Why do some people keep their sanity and others not? Well, it certainly has some disgusting scenes at times and being human and all that, I can't keep from being fascinated. Hmm.",7,0,1,23 January 1999
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Delightful improvement
","This was a delightful improvement on the first Harry Potter which was too short and too crammed. In this was there was time to tell the story and excellent acting from the better parts of the actors. Three hours may be a tad long for the youngest audience but considering the relatively high level of spookyness, perhaps they should stay in bed while their parents go and what this movie.The magic was more magical and the small puffs of smoke a nice touch. And the spiders... Whhrhrhr-yuck! The addition of Kenneth Branagh as Gilderoy Lockhart was neat. Not only was he a slimey fraud he actually seemed to enjoy the parody of himself. Also Lucius Malfoy was as well cast as his son was not.All in all a brilliant movie and true to the book. Perhaps the Quidditch game was a bit too long but hey, you can't have it all.The art department could, I might add, take a bit more care making the books look old. Two pages shown in the movie had right adjusted margins which is somewhat modern considering they were supposed to look hand written.",8,0,0,24 November 2002
Love Actually," Quaint, I think is the word
","My first impression was that this was a strangely incoherent movie but as it marched on encouragingly through the lives of an oddly normal array of normal people's lives, it quickened and slowly but steadily became a very sympathetic movie. Quaint, I think is the word.A romantic movie usually leaves the audience with nothing more than a want for identifying with this or that character. This time you leave knowing that you and your own life is what it is about. Most everyone's life, in fact. Someone once said: 'If your life was a movie, would you go and see it?'.<ul><li>Thomas Nielsen</li></ul>",8,0,2,8 January 2004
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Oh, Demon! Had I only the heart.
","Over sexed say some. Not faithful say others. Brillant says I.All the mentioned critiques may be true, yet I find this movie splendid and beautiful. I have read Bram Stoker's Dracula but fail to see why this movie's lack of faithfulness to the original story a shortcoming. As a movie it is beautiful and novel. It has drama and compassion. It has light and darkness in perfect sense and harmony. Demons destroying wonderful creatures and demonic apparitions destroyed by beauty.My only question is: Why does Van Helsing have to be so utterly stupid? In the best of the stories told before he was brilliant and ingenious. He had to be to solve this strange and occult riddle - yet here he was odd and malplaced.",7,0,1,19 February 1999
The Shawshank Redemption," Redemption is the word
","And what a way to say it! Until this one, I have never before rated a movie 10. It is by all accounts the best movie I have ever seen. Frankly I felt a little bit bored by the story but suddenly it was as if the story had taken a turn and everything fell into place. The first two thirds of the movie started making perfect sense. Then it takes another turn, perfectly underlined by Morgan Freeman's marvellously confused expression being questioned by the warden. From this part on the movie is a bit more ordinary but still a beautiful drama.The Marriage of Figaro has gotten new meaning.",10,0,0,23 January 1999
Bruce Almighty," Uninspired (or is that over-inspired?)
",Jim Carrey is great in this type of movie but this type of movie reqires some sort of originality which this movie didn't have. The script writer should've stayed in bed or changed carrier or something along those lines. Expecting to see Jim Carrey at his best? Well I'm sure he is. Expecting to enjoy it too? Not this one!,5,0,0,6 July 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," A long awaited end...
","...not just of this trilogy but also a milestone in movie making.***possible minor spoilers***This third installment was as beautifully rendered as those preceding it but also a wonderful tying of a knot bringing the story together. We met Shelob in the most realistic giant spider ever to have thrilled a movie audience. We got to see brilliant acting from a CGI figure in a two sided and expressive Gollum. Massive battles and orcs actually performing before the camera instead of simply being slaughtered. We saw many things we already knew well from the books and dreaded to see spoiled. But none were.What we didn't see and what surprised me much was the demise of Saruman and his sneaky vengeance. The book has an interesting effect on the reader in this part in that the climax seems to have passed and all is well, when suddenly Galadriel's prophecies come true and hope is seemingly lost. A true roller coaster climax. Must we wait for the DVD to see that? This is where one movie making milestone is set. With this trilogy the DVDs supersedes the theater version. We've had extended versions and extra material before, but never such hefty focus on the DVD media as this. In some ways I find this a pity. The cinema screen is on the smaller side, how small is not the TV screen compared to this? There have been many scenes left out like this one, but none that I have missed this much.The entire trilogy considered, this was an immense joy to watch. Characters were true to the book and to my own private visualizations formed over countless readings since my childhood. There were aspects of the story that could never make it to a movie and passages that had to be left out and I really think Peter Jackson made a good job of doing that. Sure, he made a few wrong turns and left out important details and added some that I find distracting but few were alarming and I am happy not to have had to be the one to do it. A few details readily in mind are these in particular:
1) The monsters, i.e. vargs, trolls etc. were sentient beings in the story. This is not in harmony with them being pictured in the movie as domesticated animals in orc service, like the orcs riding vargs in battle.2) I always saw (and maybe wrongly so) the oliphants (and the [po]tatos) as a subtle link to our world. Something recognizable that would bring a bit of a chuckle reading about them and suggest to us that Middle Earth was not an entirely different universe from ours. The oliphants in the movie, however, are humongous and simply unbelievable in their weird appearance. I would much rather they had been plain old vanilla elephants.3) Frodo was a burdened character but not a weak one. He had the weaknesses of a hobbit, true, but nothing that wouldn't turn to his advantage once in a while. In the movie the heavy load of carrying the ring is by no means evident and soon you grow tired with always seeing a debilitated Frodo where in fact he should be simply worn-out. He could easily have been made stronger without jeopardizing the sympathetic bond between the characters.All short comings aside, this was a once in a lifetime experience. I have never had a movie have this effect on me as this trilogy had.<ul><li>Thomas Nielsen</li></ul>",10,0,0,18 December 2003
Born on the Fourth of July," Do yourself a favour - read the book
","The movie is quite good, but suffers greatly from Hollywood polish. The book offers a glimpse of the maljustice brought upon this man and the grave disappointments he suffered returning from the Vietnam war. Read the book and be disgusted at how people treat each other.",6,2,4,21 July 1999
