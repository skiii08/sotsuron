The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Big yawn, what a waste of time
","What a waste of my time this film was. The acting was so flat you wonder whether the director also slept through it all. Indeed, we all know the actors are good but, watching them in this film, you'd think they're straight out of a failed 2nd grade sitcom. There is no tension whatsoever, no excitement, no suspense, no life.The storyline is even more boring than the acting and the special effects are like watching paint dry. What a load of drivel the dialogues are and don't start me on the music which is no better.Looking at the 7.5 IMDb user rating I now know for sure that the studios have fake user accounts to cheat the IMDb rating. Looking at metacritic high scores also demonstrates what goes on in this movie business/PR/marketing. Some people are definitely corrupt.OK it's my fault: I know better and should have left the theatre and gone to bed earlier.",5,44,71,21 November 2014
The Intouchables," Not a fairy tale
","The critiques in Metascore did not do their homework. They qualify the film as a feel-good fairy tale, which means they completely miss the point that it is a true story. The latter point and the unusual real life story are the reasons behind the huge success. Yes, it was filmed with actors but the real life protagonists vetted every point and the final product was not cooked and edited the 'Hollywood' way to please audiences as it did not need to be. We are not talking about a recipe- based product here. The lazy American critiques watch too many American commercial romantic comedies and other 'romanticised' genres to even suspect this was a true story...so, shame on the critiques of this film.You should see this film because the feel-good you come out of seeing it, is not made up.",7,2,6,16 August 2012
