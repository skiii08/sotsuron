The Hangover," A Horrible Overrated Mockery of a Comedy
","I only watched it because of the good rating. Watched it and disliked it. I didn't even smile throughout the whole movie, not to mention laughing - I was wondering why would someone like this....'comedy'. It's a mockery to the whole film industry and an insult to Hollywood. The 'jokes' were paltry, pitiful, poor... Should I laugh at that fat Zach Galifianakis's jokes or rather 'admire' Bradley Cooper? NO! Some of the 'funny scenes': a tiger in a hotel room - yeah, funny as nothing else; loss of memory - I 'can't breathe so much I laugh'; a little baby whose mother is nowhere to be found - I'm 'bursting into laugh'. POOR and HORRIBLE and OVERRATED! It's only one big BOREDOM. Do NOT waste your time on this.",1,3,5,17 August 2015
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," The Curse of Jack Sparrow
","Pirates of the Caribbean are without a doubt one of the best movie series of all time, but as it happens, The Curse of the Black Pearl is the worst one of these movie series.The jokes are lame, Jack's mimicry not even funny. Elizabeth and Will make a boring couple and there is no chemistry between Keira and Orlando.The story is boring, confusing, twisting into such incomprehensible storyline and dumb scenes, that if you won't sleep yourself to death, then thumb up.But why did I bother to watch the sequels, when this one I didn't like? Because I happened to watch the sequels first and loved the story of The Dead Man's Chest and the sequel of its storyline in the third movie At World'd End. I completely got into the story without even watching the first one, so it seems.Meant as introduction this Curse of the Black Pearl is, but there is no introduction at all. You can well meet the characters in the sequels and don't need to be sorry for skipping this one.Barbossa as the main villain is lame, old, boring and inexpressive, nothing compared what is to come next. He doesn't even have his own soundtrack song, and well, speaking of the OST, there isn't much to say either. I promise, watching the sequels will make you laugh at sophisticated jokes and hold your breath when the REAL enemy comes.This Curse of the Black Pearl is nothing more than a fairytale for 10-year-old boys. The only reason why I've given it 5 stars are for the respect I keep for its two younger brothers.",5,2,4,30 August 2015
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Home Is Behind The World Ahead
","The beginning of the great journey starts with an unexpected visit and expected pleasure for the audience!!! Cast is brilliant, you can see that every actor is the embodiment of their characters. Martin Freeman was BORN to play Bilbo and completely gets the character. The dwarfs are awesome! Kili and Thorin are the best dwarf characters. The Misty Mountains melody lets us immerse in the mysterious adventures that are to come. Gollum will lead you through a cavern of riddles, Thorin will fight his own past, Bilbo finds his courage, Gandalf calls his eagles at the most right moment and suddenly you forget all the real world around you. Regret if you haven't seen the movie yet!!!!! It's AWESOME and BRILLIANT!!!",10,1,4,17 August 2015
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Excellent Harry
","This one was wonderfully done!!! WELL, WELL DONE!!!It's just as if you watched the book, really. They gave everything in the movie what was mentioned in the book and more!It is:1.FUNNY thanks to the newcomer Gilderoy Lockhart, who is GENIALLY portrayed by Kenneth Branagh. There has never been an actor except for Alan Rickman who portrayed a book character half so well. Gilderoy must be Kenneth's alter ego, Gilderoy, who is so funny, big headed, incapable and treacherous.2.SCARY when Harry starts to hear the voice that no one else hears. If you were spooked while reading the book, you will be double spooked when hearing it within the movie with your own ears. It will make you feel as if only Harry and YOU were hearing that voice.3.INTERESTING while watching the main trio shedding light up on the mystery of petrified scholars. As Harry speaks Parsel tongue, as everything is HOW it was supposed to be.Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets is a mixture of the best ingredients a movie can have - fun, fear, mystery, great animation, keeping absolutely to the book, eerie villains... Just immerse yourself!BRAVO Chris Columbus!!!",10,0,1,30 August 2015
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Go hate somewhere else!
","This movie is just excellent! A great ending to a fantastic trilogy. I don't care if the book was different. I don't care if the book was thin and most of the movie's content was added and did not originally appear in the book. I haven't read the book and I don't MEAN to. The same, you hear, the same happens with MANY movies TV series and nobody complains?... I can't think of ANYTHING bad with this movie.Go complain somewhere else you ungrateful people! Go and kiss the Twilight saga! Go and sigh with 50 shades of whatever color you want! Go action with some Marvel superheros. I don't care. Go hate somewhere ELSE! I'll stick with Peter Jackson and the Hobbit trilogy.",10,2,7,8 September 2016
