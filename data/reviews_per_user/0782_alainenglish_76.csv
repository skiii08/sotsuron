Alien 3," Moving but flawed third movie (spoilers)
","The third entry into the 'Alien' series is not quite as bad as many have many have made out.  As hinted by the title, the film returns to the original's central idea of a single creature against a team of motley humans.   New director David Fincher has created an atmospheric and ultimately quite moving ending to what was thought to be a trilogy at the time.  However, the film does not expand on the themes of the first two and leaves quite a few gaping holes in it's plot.The opening sequence (which uncomfortably jumbles the opening credits in with the action) Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and her fellow survivors from 'Aliens' forced to crash-land on prison planet after an alien egg and incumbent face-hugger sets fire to their ship.  Ripley awakes to find she is, yet again, the sole survivor in the most unfriendly company of the prisoners.  The face-hugger also survives and impregnates a prisoner's pet dog.  Before long, a new alien is born and proceeds to decimate the prisoners.  As well this, Ripley discovers that she, too, is carrying an alien inside her....The story for this one is not terrible, as it maintains momentum and keeps the viewer interested, but on reflection leaves one or two unanswered questions.  It is never sufficiently explained how the alien egg got on board the ship, and how the same face-hugger could infect both Ripley and the prisoner's dog is never explained at all.  Some plot strands, such as what happens to demented prisoner Golic (Paul McGann), are left unexplored (like all the films so far, inclusion of deleted material could have helped this alot.)  The greatest victim of the plot is, ironically, the alien of the title.  The first two films took great care in creating a creature whose motivation for killing people was to reproduce.  All of that is thrown out of the window here, the alien reduced to a mere killing machine that randomly attacks anyone and everyone (except the impregnated Ripley) with no rhyme or reason to its actions.In spite of this inherent flaws, the script does deliver a strong main thread with Ripley's conflict with the creature, her pregnancy giving her situation a strangely ambiguous twist that is resolved in the film's moving finale.  There are also quite a few distinctive characters amongst a cast of mainly cardboard cut-outs.Weaver maintains a strong lead as Ripley and she is in the fine company of the mainly British actors playing the prisoners.  Charles Dance is excellent as the prison's doctor, forming a touching if brief romance with Ripley. The late Brian Glover is well-cast as the surly supervisor, and Ralph Brown is also good as his simpleton assistant.  Charles S. Dutton makes a striking impression as Dillon, a prisoner who has used religion as a means to guide both himself and his fellow inmates.As with 'Alien', the set design here is superb.  While the prison environment (including, among other things, an ore refinery) is too expansive to be claustrophic, it looks great with its shades of brown, black and red creating the right feel of griminess and imminent doom.While Fincher doesn't quite have Cameron's touch with the action scenes, there are some good set-pieces in the prison's tunnels as well as the finale in the refinery.Overall, a good if slightly muddled effort that would have made a good ending to this series of films.",Null,1,2,28 May 2003
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Effectively staged, if rather bland, beginning to the prequel trilogy (spoilers)
","Released in 1999 to overwhelming public expectation, 'The Phantom Menace' severely disappointed many of the fans of the original series and excited the wrath of many a critic, who believed the whole movie was just money-spinner and an exercise in digital technology. Some, but not all, of this criticism is accurate. While the film does not recapture the magic of the original trilogy and the special effects do dominate a bit too much, the end result is still an effectively staged film.The story, set some forty or fifty years before the original 'Star Wars', begins in the very murky world of intergalactic politics. The Trade Federation enforce a blockade on the peaceful world of Naboo in response to a political decision to taxate their trade routes. The Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic (Terence Stamp) sends two Jedi Knights Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan MacGregor) to sort out the problem....Forced to flee after the Federation tries to kill them, the pair rescue the planet's ruler Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman) and a local ne'er-do-well Jar Jar Binks (Ahmed Best). They intend to bring the Queen to the Republic's ruling planet Coruscant, where she can plead her case to Galactic Senate. Making a pit-stop on desert planet Tatooine, they pick up a young slave boy, Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd), who possesses mysterious powers, all the while being trailed by a mysterious dark warrior Darth Maul (Ray Park), whose boss is manipulating everyone from behind the scenes.....The film begins what is essentially a very different story to that told by 'Star Wars' and it's sequels. Whereas the original trilogy told the tale of good triumphing over evil, this film sees the start of a tale that will see the evolution of a benevolent but inefficient democracy into an evil dictatorship and the turning of a great warrior into an agent of pure darkness.In it's differences from the first (but chronologically later) set of films that present a whole wealth of story possibilities. There is political intrigue, hints at impending tragedy and a couple of ambiguous characters who are not all they appear to be...Where the script falls down is in failing to make these themes exciting to the audience. A lot of the characters are left with bland, staid dialogue that weakens the effect of a great many scenes. Some of this is nullified by virtue of some good acting but better dialogue (especially on the Tatooine and Coruscant scenes) would have really helped liven the proceedings. Humour is another thing missing from this script, and it is left to the token slapstick idiot Jar Jar Binks to provide most of the comedy relief. Director George Lucas wrote the script for this film, as he did for the original 'Star Wars'. While his style of writing was fine for the relatively simple story that movie, a more skilled and experienced writer could have taken better advantage of the story's ideas.The acting in this film is mostly very good, and the majority of the principal actors rise above the deficiencies of the writing. Neeson and MacGregor just about pull of their lines and convince as the Jedi. Natalie Portman is a mixed bag as Amidala. She's good when pleading her case to the Senate or being a surrogate sister to Anakin, but isn't quite so convincing when the script asks her to play an action hero. Ahmed Best plays Jar Jar Binks, a character who isn't quite as irritating as many have made out and who jives up each of his scenes with his fruity speech and mannerisms. Jake Lloyd is likable as the future Darth Vader, lending spirit, wonder and a sense of adventure to the part.Terence Stamp should have maybe have been allowed more screen time as Chancellor Valorum. He only just registers as the well-intentioned but weak leader of the Republic and some more time could maybe have been devoted to give some depth to his character. Ian MacDiarmid, on the other hand, is excellent as the Machiavellian Senator Palpatine. He lends a wonderfully sinister depth to his role so that you know he is up to no good even as he's being sincere. Ray Park is also on fine form, giving the right mix of aggression and athleticism as Darth Maul. The final duel between him and the two Jedi is a winner.Technically, the film is an accomplishment in digital technology and the settings for much of the action are very well depicted. The lush forests and waterfalls of Naboo, the glorious wonder of the underwater city to the grandeur of Coruscant (a detailed combination of flying motorways and ludicrous skyscrapers) provide colourful backdrops to the action, all accentuated by John Williams' atmospheric score.But whereas the original 'Star Wars' used it's effects sparingly and thus maximised their impact, this film throws digital effects into nearly every shot to the point where the initial wonder at them quickly wears off.To conclude, the film is perhaps not quite the film many 'Star Wars' fans expected, 'Phantom Menace' is still a very good picture. It's sequel 'Attack of the Clones' was an improvement, as will be (we hope) the as-yet-unnamed third and final installment of the franchise.",Null,2,5,26 June 2003
Ali," Effective biography of sports legend(Warning: spoilers below)
","One of surprisingly only a few motion pictures made about the man who dared call himself The Greatest, 'Ali' is a good but unremarkable film.  It sticks to a pretty formulaic structure, outlining the ten years between Mohammed Ali's first defeat of Sonny Liston to the final 'Rumble in the Jungle' with George Foreman.The first part of the movie deals not so much with Ali's sporting career but more his social and political convictions, in particular his involvement with the Nation of Islam and his refusal to be inducted into the United States Army to fight in the Vietnam War.  Later on the film deals with the man's troubled personal life and his apparently waning sports career.Director Michael Mann has fashioned these story elements to show Ali as a hard-headed, occasionally quite arrogant man who nevertheless had strong beliefs and was prepared to fight for them against seemingly insuperable odds.  His final victory over George Foreman concludes the film with Ali triumphant over all opponents and critics and assured in his status as 'The Greatest'.As fascinating as the historical detail is within the movie (which also makes nods at other black historical figures of the period like Malcolm X and Martin Luther King) the plotline, particularly towards the end, is a little formulaic.  In this film, social and political detail aside, Ali could easily be just another everyman 'overcoming all odds' and some further exploration of his life after the Foreman fight could have maybe helped to rectify this. The boxing scenes, especially the last one, are very well paced and choreographed and build a strong sense of suspense.  A nice touch is during the second Ali-Liston fight where a camera lightbulb flashes as Sonny hits the mat.  The resulting photograph is now a classic Ali picture.Performance-wise, Will Smith puts in an overall solid performance as Ali. It is clear he trained very hard for the role and his preparation shows in the fight scenes.  His dramatic moments, especially the induction scene in the gym hall, are also very well done.  The only possible flaw in his performance comes when he's being cocky or throwing around Ali's wisecracks. When this happens, his performance feels too similiar to parts he has played before.  All other performances are satisfactory.All things considered, 'Ali' is a very good film that provides some intriguing insight into the motivations of a 20th century icon.",Null,0,1,28 June 2002
Ghost," Touching and hilarious romantic thriller
","'Ghost' has been riffed as a piece of romantic cheese, but really it is a classic movie incorporating everything from romance, horror and laugh-out-loud comedy.A well-to-do accountant Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze), shares an uptown apartment with his girlfriend Molly (Demi Moore), a clay potterer, a lady with whom he is very much in love. However, Sam is murdered in an attempted mugging and as he remains on earth in spiritual form he must find a way to protect his girlfriend before the killer strikes again...Swayze and Moore work well as a couple and you really believe in the connection between them. But you need some eccentricity in this kind of picture, in order to balance out the romantic element. The film gets this in the form of Oda Mae Brown (Whoopi Goldberg). The joke with this character is that she is a fake medium, who learns to her surprise that her powers are in fact real. Goldberg is excellent in this role, her timing is perfect and she is hilarious throughout. Also of note is Vincent Schiavelli as the deranged Subway Ghost, who teaches Sam how to affect the world around him. This a brief but scene-stealing performance.The villains come in the form of Tony Goldwyn, as Sam's slimy, double-dealing and increasing desperate best friend. Rick Aviles is also well-cast is low-life hit-man Willie Lopez.Best of all is Patrick Swayze who heads the cast as the title character. Swayze takes a lot of riffing for his performances, but having seen him in three movies (including this one) I don't know why. Sure he's not a great actor, but he's not a bad one. He creates a terrific chemistry between him and Moore, and an even better comic chemistry in his scenes with Whoopi Goldberg. His partnership with the latter really makes the picture. Check the scene where keeps her up all night singing 'I'm Henry the Eighth I Am'.The film is wrapped up nicely with a lovely moving theme tune and some good ghostly special effects. Despite some serious moments, in the main the film is very light-hearted and doesn't take itself too seriously.Definitely one to watch for a good night in.",9,7,9,14 December 2008
Marie Antoinette," Contemporary, touching and bizarre (major spoilers)
","Renting this movie out on DVD, I had very little idea when I sat down to watch it as to who Marie Antoinette was. I was vaguely aware that she was the French monarch whose reign preceded the French revolution, inflamed by a remark she supposedly made about her people starving through lack of bread 'let them eat cake'. She was guillotined eventually after the revolution. This was all I knew going as I sat down to watch it.The movie certainly stimulated interest in me to know more about the French queen, who the film does its best to portray sympathetically. In this, it largely succeeds and I found myself drawn towards Marie Antoinette and I found her story to be enlightening and in the end very moving.Played by Kirsten Dunst, Marie Antoinette is an Austrian aristocrat's daughter, who is coerced as part of a family connection to be wife to the Dauphin (Jason Schwartzmann), son of King Louis XV of France. As part of the conditions of the marriage, she is required to produce with the Dauphin an heir to the French throne. But attempting this with the sexually passive and uninterested Dauphin, combined with the mindless intrigues and rituals at the French court at the palace Versailles, only serve to alienate Marie from the rest of the world around her...The famed lavish excesses of Marie's lifestyle are here depicted as a logical reaction by her to the stifling gilded prison in which she finds herself, to really move or expresses herself freely. Preoccupied with trying to do this, as well as produce an heir, means Marie does not fully acquaint herself with the political and economic realities of her country until it is far, far too late. In fact the world outside the luxurious environs of French royalty is barely depicted or even referred to. There is ironic reference to French support for the American revolution being one of the things that fuels France's own. Only at the end of the movie, when the revolution reaches Versailles, does reality crash into Marie's self-absorbed world, which literally falls down around her ears. All of this, to me, was entirely logical. Cutting away to events other than what is happening with Marie could have undermined audience sympathy with her.Though keeping her American accent, Kirsten Dunst does a commendable job as Marie. Dunst is one of a number of young Hollywood actresses (among them Natalie Portman, Anna Paquin and 'Hard Candy's Ellen Page) who pick their projects depending on their relevance and theme. In this, the role of Marie Antoinette is a step in the right direction for Dunst. Jason Schwartzmann is believable as her clueless husband and Steve Coogan is on fine form as Marie's guide and conscience. I would maybe have liked to have seen more of Rip Torn's King Louis XV, to draw a starker contrast between him and his son. As it is, I don't think we see enough of him.Shot in and around Versailles itself, the attention to period detail (the clothes, shoes and food) is meticulous and the presence of a contemporary soundtrack really makes it come alive.A very brave and ambitious project ably pulled off.",9,1,2,5 March 2007
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Lively, sexy and spirited action/adventure (spoilers)
","Smarting after the failure of his World War II comedy '1941', film-maker Steven Spielberg was looking for something that would restore the magic touch he'd showed in previous efforts such as 'Jaws' and 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind'.  He and 'Star Wars' creator George Lucas then came up with an idea about an adventuring archaeologist called Indiana Smith, casting Tom Selleck in the role.  The character was later renamed Indiana Jones, and after some wrangling with the producers of 'Magnum P.I' (with whom Tom Selleck was contracted) the part was recast with Harrison Ford, already a big hit with audiences as Han Solo in 'Star Wars'.It's 1936, and fedora-hatted, whip-wielding archaeologist Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) treks through the South American jungles seeking a golden idol.  In obtaining it, he survives the pitfalls of a booby-trapped temple (including poisoned darts, a bottomless pit and a huge rolling boulder) only to lose his prize to his arch-rival, suave Frenchman Belloq (Paul Freeman). 
Back in the States, working his day job as a college professor, he is approached by the US government who tell him the Nazis are on the point of discovering the Ark of the Covenant, a religious artefact of considerable destructive power.  Jones is assigned to find the Ark before the Nazis do. He secures the help of bitter ex-flame Marion (Karen Allen) and salty old friend Sallah (John Rhys-Davies) but finds himself in over his head before too long...What drives 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is its spirit and sense of adventure. Many of the action sequences (despite featuring their fair share of blood) have a very lighthearted feel to them, particularly the famous scene where Indy, facing off with a massive swordsman, casually shoots his foe than engage in a protracted fight.  Later action scenes including a fight under a moving plane, and a finely constructed horse/truck chase sequence, are fluidly paced and exciting.  John William's score (including the highly memorable theme tune) accentuates every scene brilliantly.Mixed in with the action are elements of mystery, romance and gory horror. Although the Jewish Spielberg was to give a more serious depiction of the Nazis in later films 'Schindlers List' and 'Saving Private Ryan', here is content to portray them as simple-minded, comic-book baddies.  Knowing Spielberg's background, you can sense just a little sadism in the ways the villains are dispatched, particularly in the film's bloodbath finale.Harrison Ford became a pop cultural icon with his portrayal of Indiana Jones, with trademark hat, whip and ready wisecrack.  He embodies the reckless, savvy but relentless hero as he's thrown from one situation to the next.  Jones is strong, but he's not invincible and visibly endures considerable pain through the course of his adventures.  This creates an identifiability with the hero, which strengthens the characterization.Karen Allen is a superb heroine, pristinely beautiful without being too glamourous.  It's a pity her initial hard-drinking persona degenerates into mindless screeching but Allen still holds up very well, and has a great chemistry with Ford.The direct opposite of the rough and ready hero, Belloq thwarts Jones in the film's opening scenes and later leads the Nazis in the search for the Ark. Paul Freeman plays the villain well with a suave, gentlemanly relish. Backing him up is Ronald Lacey as creepy, lisping Nazi agent Toht.Thoroughly enjoyable from beginning to end, 'Raiders' was followed by two sequels for Indiana Jones in 1984 and 1989.",Null,0,0,29 May 2004
Casablanca," Well made, but not as relevant as it was at the time (spoilers)
","'Casablanca' is quite rightly hailed by many as a wartime film classic.  If you can enjoy your movies without dollops of sex and violence as is the trend these days, there's much about 'Casablanca' to enjoy. 
The setting of Morocco town Casablanca, where refugees fleeing the Nazis wait up to years to secure letters of transit to America, sees cold-hearted nightclub owner Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) get involved in the wartime struggle when his old flame Ilse Lund (Ingrid Bergman) walks into his club on the arm of her husband Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid), a sought-after resistance leader.  Blaine is in possession of two letters of transit, and Ilse and Lazslo persuade Blaine to hand them over, all the while eluding the attentions of the snake-like German Colonel Strasser (Conrad Veidt) and Captain Renault (Claude Rains), the duplicitious chief-of-police...The script is a joy.  Not a word is wasted, and nearly every line is memorable.  The acting is excellent.  Bogart is well-cast as Rick, and Claude Rains enjoys himself as the jovial Captain Renault.  Ingrid Bergman is divinely beautiful and as a leading lady has an onscreen grace denied most of her modern contemporaries.  Paul Henreid acquits himself well as the honourable Laszlo.The only problem with the story today is its political undertones, which implies that America is an isolationist state that should be more involved with world affairs.  That may have been true during World War II, but it isn't the case now.  The recent war on Iraq, along with a history of US interventionism, renders this part of the story dated and misguidedly patriotic.Regardless, it is hard to find a film today as well-written and acted as 'Casablanca'.",Null,2,5,20 August 2004
Minority Report," Exciting and enjoyable Spielberg thriller
","'Minority Report' is acclaimed director Steven Spielberg's first foray into the thriller genre, although he has tackled many of the themes and characters of 'Minority Report' in other films.  'Minority Report', largely due to its nihilistically futuristic setting, does not feel like a Spielberg movie and it seems to have the influence of other distinguished film-makers, as diverse as Ridley Scott and Alfred Hitchcock.The premise alone is enough to sell the movie:  What if crime could be predicted and stopped before it happened?  The plot, set around 50 years into the future, focusses on Pre-Crime detective John Anderton, a hard-working policeman whose job it is to stop criminals, specifically murderers, before they commit crime.  He does this through the aid of the Pre-Cogs, zombie-like prophets whose only function lies in the detecting and predicting of crime.But Anderton is thrown into a perilous situation when the Pre-Cogs reveal HE will commit a murder in the near future, prompting him to go the run from the corrupt establishment he serves.The plot serves up more than its fair share of surprises (characters whom the audience believe to be villains turn not to be so bad after all, and vice versa), also allowing for some background depth and development to its characters.  The finale is perfect, yet totally unexpected.Cruise handles the chief role with grace and style, carefully etching his characters frequently frantic emotional states.  So often dismissed by some as a Hollywood pretty boy, under Spielberg's direction he gives one of the best performances of his career.He is given excellent support by Max Von Sydow as his untrustworthy boss, British actress Samantha Morton shines as liberated Pre-Cog Agatha and character actor Peter Stormare is on good form as a dangerous, creepy eye-surgeon.Action has always been Spielberg speciality and here he forgoes the disturbing realism of 'Saving Private Ryan' in favour of some exciting, funny and brilliantly preposterous fantasy action scenes.  He is given some good support in this with some fine camerawork and special effects.  These are put to their most effective use when they show how advertising has become more intrusive as adverts frequently recognise and address people by name, with some interesting consequences.Spielberg keeps the tension cranked up admirably, but also allows for some softer moments, such as when Agatha explains to John and his wife what their late son's life would have been like had he lived and the quiet, sentimental ending, the only reminder that the film is a Spielberg movie.Another splendid masterpiece from a master film-maker, who has again come up with another great story that demonstrates both the humanity and horror in the human spirit.",Null,0,0,21 August 2002
Erin Brockovich," Strong performance by Roberts disguises formulaic plot (spoilers)
","'Erin Brockovich' is based on the true story of a single mother of three who successfully brought a civil action against a corporate firm guilty of poisoning the water of a small-town community.  Despite a formulaic plot and gathering of near-stereotypical supporting characters, the film succeeds through a good mix of comedy and drama.The film opens with Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts) unsuccessfully trying to get a job at a hospital before breaking her neck in a car accident.  After failing to get compensation, she bullies her lawyer Ed Masry (Albert Finney) into taking her on as an assistant at his firm.  Whilst there, she discover some alarming evidence about a gas and electrics company, poisoned water and the illness-stricken residents the backwater village...Technically, the film works using early Nineties songs to liven up moments where Erin is investigating and enhances the mundane, everyday feel of the picture.  The film is also well-edited, making alot of the scientific and legal jargon simple and digestible.  It is never unclear to the attentive viewer exactly what is going on and why.Performances are excellent.  Julia Roberts deservedly won an Oscar for her winning portrayal of Erin: she's sarcastic, no-nonsense but not unsympathetic. There are times when she plays character as a little too nasty to the point where she nearly loses audience empathy. She's balanced out by Albert Finney as her harassed but honest boss who's not afraid to put her in her place from time to time.  Aaron Eckhardt turns in a fine performance as Erin's loyal but neglected biker boyfriend.  The interaction between these three characters forms the movie's core.It is in the script and story that 'Erin Brockovich' very nearly falls down. Beyond the three central characters, no character is given any degree of depth and come very close to stereotyping on several occasions.  The people Erin helps out are honest but helpless victims; the corporation she's up against composed of and aided by greedy or inhuman opportunists and the lawyers who eventually help Erin and Ed are played as patronising and cynical.  It is an interesting but unambiguous stock of characters.There are currently allegations surfacing that the real Erin and Ed actually duped the Hinkley residents and the water was not as poisonous as was claimed in the case.  This has created an ambiguity around Erin Brockovich that would have been interesting to explore in the movie.Nevertheless, if you enjoy a good people-power flick, or want an example of some fine acting and drama, you could do a hell of a lot worse than this.",Null,1,2,19 December 2003
Se7en," Thought-provoking chiller(Spoilers below)
","A hard-hitting, noirish movie,, 'Seven' is a detective horror thriller that contains a pair of typically mis-matched cops as they try to hunt down an elusive serial killer, whose modus operandi is the Seven Deadly Sins......In an unnamed, rain-drenched hellhole of a city, world-weary Detective Somerset(Morgan Freeman) is about to retire.  But he must spend his last week on the force with a hot-headed rookie, Detective Mills (Brad Pitt), as they uncover the killer behind a series of unusual and grisly murders.Their first case is a grotesquely obese man who has been forced to eat until his stomach bursts.  Their next case is a lawyer who's been forced to cut off a pound of his own flesh.  Somerset deduces the killer is murdering people according to the Seven Deadly Sins.  Little by little, as one murder follows another, the detectives themselves become entrapped in the killer's diabolical plan.A taut, solid script delivers a fair share of shocks, suspense and a certain amount of gore.  Andrew Kevin Walker also allows his characters to muse on the purpose of life, as well as adding some dark and deeply cynical views on everyday reality.The film is very well shot, with light and colour being used in particular to accentuate the plot and themes of the film.  A note left behind by the killer at the first murder scene reads: 'Long is the road, and hard, that out of Hell leads up into light.'  This is reflected in the way the murder scenes are set, the first murder being committed in gloomy darkness and the last, and the most shocking, being committed in blinding sunlight.  The cinematography further gives a very bleak view of city life, the streets shown to be grotty, grimy and miserable.The film's fine technical qualities are supported by some excellent performances.  Brad Pitt is on fine form is the cocksure copper whose impulsiveness becomes his undoing.  By contrast, Morgan Freeman is very restrained, giving a quietly confident performance as the intellectual Somerset.  Kevin Spacey nearly steals the entire film as the killer John Doe.  His scene in the back of the police car where he righteously justifies his gruesome moral crusade is the film's most powerful and thought-provoking scene.Well directed by David Fincher, 'Se7en' remains an intriguing and very clever piece of modern horror.",Null,1,1,4 September 2002
As Good as It Gets," Fascinating comedy-drama (spoilers)
","One of the biggest hits of 1997 and garnering Jack Nicholson yet another Oscar, 'As Good As It Gets' is a fascinating comedy-drama.  It might be perceived as bad taste using mental illness as the basis for a comedy, but the premise works wonderfully in a story that explores the nature of being both nasty and nice.In modern-day middle-class New York city, Melvin Udall (Jack Nicholson) is a writer of successful romantic novels.  He also suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder, which means he eats in his favourite restaurant using only plastic cutlery, does not walk on cracks in the pavement, and keeps everyone around him at a safe distance through a barrage of obscene insults.  He is gradually brought out of his shell when his gay artist neighbour Simon (Greg Kinnear), is viciously attacked and robbed in his own apartment.  The artist's manic art dealer Frank (Cuba Gooding Jr.) forces Melvin to look after Simon's dog while he's in hospital. Elsewhere, Melvin develops a close relationship with Carol (Helen Hunt), a tough-talking waitress with a disabled young son...The film's main strength is it's four leading actors, who turn in some fabulous performances to make the film work.  Nicholson has been well-cast in the role of Melvin.  In the hands of any other actor, Melvin would be repellent.  Nicholson lends the part his customary charisma and presence to make the part endearing, sympathetic and scabrously funny.  He develops a good onscreen partnership with Helen Hunt's Carol.  There is a fine psychological (if not necessarily sexual) chemistry between the pair, and their inevitable coupling works well because of it.Greg Kinnear is on fine form as Simon, who loses then rediscovers his love for his art.  What's interesting about the character is that his homosexuality is simply a trait, rather than the dominating facet of his personality.  In Kinnear's hands the character is subtle, touching and believable throughout.  Cuba Gooding Jr is maniacally slick as art dealer Frank, but he is a little underused, his presence being sorely missed during the last third of the film.Director James L. Brooks keeps the tone of the film consistently lighthearted without being patronising.  That said, some overly cute scenes with Simon's dog could have been clipped out. He and fellow writer Mark Andrus have developed an interesting tale with several plot arcs that are fascinating to watch.  As Melvin and Carol gradually soften up, Simon assertively toughens up.The film chides Melvin's defensive nastiness, but at the same time mocks minor characters who are naively or superficially nice.  These include Carol's busybody mother, forever prying into her daughter's business; Simon's ridiculously sentimental Spanish nurse and most memorably, the cloying receptionist who unwisely asks Melvin what he thinks about women. The film advises that we must never repel others, but must always approach them with sincerity and respect.To conclude, this is an interesting movie that looks at how seemingly different people can learn to understand each other and does so with streak of scathingly honest humour.",Null,0,1,19 April 2004
Alien: Resurrection," Fascinating, if slightly unmemorable, coda to the franchise (spoilers)
","'Alien: Resurrection' continues the story of Ellen Ripley after her sacrifice at the end of the third movie.  While this fourth film functions in some respect as something of an addendum, it does do what the otherwise excellent third Alien flick did not: expands upon the aliens biology and psychology and gives us some interesting new insights into the creature.It has been nearly 200 years since Ripley (again played by Sigourney Weaver) sacrificed herself on the prison planet Fiorina 161.  In this space-set adventure she's resurrected by a group of scientists (among them Brad Dourif) and the military, headed up by General Perez (Dan Hedaya).  The idea behind her resurrection is to use alien D.N.A in her blood to create an Alien Queen and a new Army of alien soldiers.  Naturally, this plan backfires and the aliens are loosed just as a team of pirates (among them Ron Perlman and Winona Ryder) attacks and boards the ship...On completion of this movie, director Jean-Pierre Jeunet rightly paid homage to 'Alien' director Ridley Scott and the alien designer H.R Giger, saying that they were the original artists and those that follow are just artisans. That is a very true sentiment, as alot of the story and character elements in this one are borrowed or are least familiar from previous instalments. There the tough grunts (the pirates in this picture equivalent to the Marines from 'Aliens'), ambiguous characters with hidden agendas or motives, and the onrunning theme of the humans out to exploit the deadly aliens for their own purposes.  Unlike the previous three movies, this film is set near Earth, providing the basis for the film's finale.Performances are good enough for this kind of fare but Ripley, predictably, has the most interesting and best-developed role.  The combination of both human and alien D.N.A in her blood has gifted her with some unusual abilities, bleeding acid blood and being able to scale walls with ease. This in turn renders makes Ripley's relationship to the aliens far more intimate than previously envisaged and comes up with a few unexpected surprises.Elsewhere, Brad Dourif makes a creepy impression as one of the scientists, communicating very well his characters obsessed fascination and awe of the aliens.  However, Dan Hedaya should have perhaps been used more as General Perez, Perlman and Michael Wincott are unmemorable, and Winona Ryder fails to exploit fully the dramatic opportunities in her role.Visually, the film is impressive.  Like David Fincher and Ridley Scott before him, Jeunet has an eye for the gloomy and portentous and it shows here.  The set designs, with their colours of rust, red and brown are beautifully reminiscent of the prison from the third film whilst creating a feel unique to the picture.  The special effects here are a welcome mix of traditional and CGi, although neither is overused to detrimental effect.There are some interesting and memorable moments to behold here.  The first is the scene where a scientist eyes up an alien in the laboratory and the camera pans back to reveal the Alien Queen in all her glory.  It is a frightening moment and suggestive of the horror of the experiments.  There is also an inventive action scene where the aliens are fought underwater. The finale is strangely moving, as is the last scene (a slow-moving coda) on Earth.'Alien: Resurrection' is not too bad an effort and does expand on the themes of the first two films in ways that the third film did not.  It is that third film, however, which really should have ended the series.",Null,5,8,28 May 2003
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Exciting and sexy fantasy film (spoilers)
","'Pirates of the Caribbean' is a fine fantasy movie.  The poster alone conveys all the elements to be found here: action, mystery, piracy and a hint of sexy romance.  The result is a slick and exciting film that entertains from beginning to end.A brief sequence at the beginning shows a young girl, at sea with her sailor father (Jonathan Pryce), retrieve a mysterious medallion from the neck of a drowning boy.  The young girl grows up into the beautiful Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) and the young man, who has admired from afar, is now a local sword-maker Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) in a Mediterranean coastal town.  Chaos ensues Elizabeth is captured by undead pirates led by Captain Barrabosa (Geoffrey Rush), who need Elizabeth's medal to restore their souls.  With the aid of Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), a mad pirate, Turner sets after Barrabosa, intending to rescue Elizabeth....The story is excellent, very conventional but enjoyably so.  The usual pirate cliches are in evidence; buried treasure, scurvy seadogs, buxom damsels in distress and dashing heroes.  All of this works through a line of outrageous humour that satirizes the kind of thing the film is paying homage to.The technical aspect of the film is marvellous.  Well lit and directed with sumptous costumes, scenery and props, it looks great.  Special effects are a good mix of CGI and model work.  Fight scenes are fantastic, the first duel between Turner and Sparrow, and the last between Sparrow and Barrabosa being especially inventive and memorable.Johnny Depp all but steals the movie as mad pirate Sparrow.  With a raspy Cockney English accent, and a sense of humour that's ahead of his time, it's a very memorable performance.  Only Geoffrey Rush as the villain can really stand out with him on board, and Rush turns in his usual fine performance. Orlando Bloom plays the straight good guy role he's fashioned so well in 'Lord of the Rings', and Keira Knightly is gorgeous and spunky as the girl of his dreams.  Jonathan Pryce and Jack Davenport are on hand to play the standard British fops.Never dragging on, there is not a moment wasted here.  They certainly don't make them like this any more.",Null,3,5,23 December 2003
Spider-Man 2," Superior sequel (spoilers)
","The original film with the web-spinning superhero was a good effort, but far from perfect.  It had certain weaknesses in performance and storyline. However, the characters and the essential humanity of Peter Parker/Spider Man were strong enough to maintain the film's momentum.  The weaknesses have been overcome, and the dramatic power upped considerably, for 'Spider-Man 2'.The story is now moved on two years, and Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is now balancing two jobs, his college studies and his duty as Spider-Man.  Things are not going well: he loses his job as a pizza delivery boy, he is in danger of losing his one true love Mary-Jane (Kirsten Dunst) to a handsome astronaut, and as all this piles on top of him, he starts to lose his powers.  This is not good, as New York is set to be menaced by another scientist gone mad, in the form of Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina), whose attempts to manipulate cold fusion have left him with four tentacles, pinned to his back, that have taken over his mind...Director Sam Raimi has wisely followed the sequel dictum that less is more. Throughout the opening forty minutes, we see less in the way of web-spun superheroics, and this considerably strengthens the story.  It also continues the themes about morality, responsibility and power.  Being a superhero in 'Spider-Man' is not something to be envious of.  It is a responsibility and heavy burden that interferes with your life, damages your relationships, and keeps you at a cold distant from those you're trying to protect.  Tobey Maguire portrays this vulnerability with touching humour and pathos.As well as the themes, the various story threads from the original movie have been picked up and explored further here.  Parker's relationship with Mary-Jane Watson has come under strain since he shunned her affections to protect her from his identity, and the dilemma about whether Parker should accept the loss of his powers in order to settle down with her echoes 'Superman II'.  Kirsten Dunst has limited screen time, but is still very good.  James Franco is back as Harry Osborn, who has now taken over his late father's company, and becomes increasingly bitter and obsessed with Spider-Man.  Spider-Man killed his father (The Green Goblin, played in a cameo by a returning Willem Dafoe), resulting in a last-minute twist that seals his fate forever.  Franco is excellent in a much expanded role.Even better is the chief villain of the piece, Otto Octavius, otherwise known as Doc Ock.  It would have been better to let actor Alfred Molina use his natural English accent role for a more sinister effect, but otherwise his performance is spot-on.  Early scenes emphasise Octavius's down-to-earth humanity, with a love of poetry and beautiful wife.  He is not quite as frightening as the Green Goblin, but he is more  well-rounded and more sympathetic.  His is less a case of megalomania but more warped noble intentions.  Unlike the Green Goblin, who remained a monster to the end, Octavius eventually regains his humanity, and his inevitable death scene is more satisfying as a result.There is still room for humour and action amidst all the weighty seriousness.  J.K Simmons is back as newspaper editor J.Jonah Jameson.  He was disappointing in the first movie, but is far better here with more screen time and much better dialogue.  When told his wife's lost his chequebook, he replies 'Thanks for the good news!'  Terrific action scenes included Octavius' transformation, the finale in a riverside warehouse, and an exciting sequence where Spider-Man rescues a runaway train.There is plenty room for at least one more sequel, and a 'Spider-Man' trilogy would be a fantastic way to round the films off.  It would be a shame if this was turned into an ongoing franchise with endless sequels. Yet if further efforts are as good as this one, that might not be a bad thing.",Null,0,0,18 July 2004
Batman Returns," Flawed but intriguing sequel to the original (spoilers below)
","'Batman Returns' does not really follow as a sequel to 'Batman', but stands as a flawed but nevertheless unique superhero movie that inspires in its audience pity and empathy, rather than comical loathing, for the villainous protagonists.The plot is this:  a horribly disfigured baby boy is born, amid screams of terror, to two rich snobs in Gotham City.  Disgusted with their offspring, they abandon him, throwing the carriage-bound tot into a stream on a cold winter night.  The carriage ends up in an abandoned penguin-house where the boy is found, and raised by penguins.Thirty-three years later, the boy has grown into the Penguin (Danny DeVito) and has taken charge of a corrupt circus troupe, intent on taking his revenge on Gotham City.  He secures the help of a wealthy industrialist Max Shreck (Christopher Walken), who in turn plans to manipulate the Penguin for his own ends.When Max's bullied secretary, Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer), stumbles onto his scheming, he murders her.  But Selina is mysteriously resurrected by cats, and is reborn into Catwoman, and becomes hell-bent on getting even with Shreck.Standing in the way of all three of them is Batman (Micheal Keaton), Gotham's nocturnal protector who by day is a reclusive millionaire, Bruce Wayne.  Director Tim Burton was given more free rein with this movie than in 'Batman' and in alot of this respects this works.  The characterisations and plot are much deeper and stronger in this movie than in 'Batman', the plot is less conventional, and the villains are doubly freakish. 
The only possible flaw in this is an occasional lack of coherency in the story, where occasionally things don't quite follow one another in proper sequence, and when they do, you're not sure when they follow.  For instance, does the Penguin plan his final attack on Gotham IMMEDIATELY after his first attack has failed?  Selina reappears in Max's office two days after he has tried to kill her.  Would this scene not have made more sense if it came the morning after he tried to kill her?Other flaws include some poor editing in the action scenes and there are times when the person under the Bat cowl clearly ISN'T Keaton.However, Burton compensates for these potentially crippling flaws with some broad narrative strokes, filming around striking sets and backdrops.  These, along with a rich music score from Danny Elfman, create a wonderfully gloomy atmosphere.  The result is more of a dark fairytale than 'Batman', and it works very well.Micheal Keaton is back, and continues his consistent performance as the melancholy, conflicted hero of the piece.  Michelle Pfeiffer is sexy yet menacing as Catwoman, and her transformation is a highly charged dramatic moment.  Once resurrected she stumbles, zombie-like, into her cosy apartment before coming alive in a rage to tear the place apart.  There is a strong chemistry between Batman and Catwoman, and their relationship is perfect through it's doomed complexity.An unrecognisable Danny DeVito evinces both loathing and a deep sense of sympathy from the audience as the Penguin, especially in the final moments. His fate is deserved but is tragically unavoidable.  The real villain of the piece, Max Shreck, is well played by Christopher Walken, as he ruthlessly cajoles and manipulates the Penguin even as Catwoman eventually gets the better of him.  Ironically, it his single deviance from an otherwise selfish nature that results in his downfall.Burton didn't helm the final two Batman movies, but this is widely regarded as his definitive statement on the Caped Crusader.  Whilst 'Batman Returns' is certainly a flawed picture, it is possessed a wonderfully poetry in its story-telling, as well as an empathy for all it's characters.  As such it stands as the best 'Batman' movie of the series.",Null,0,0,30 October 2002
Dead Poets Society," Intriguing male version of 'The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie' (major spoilers ahead)
","Anyone familiar with the Muriel Spark novel 'The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie' or the film of the same name will easily spot parallels with this 1980s Robin Williams picture, in which he plays an idealistic English teacher who inspires his pupils to greatness.The setting has been updated into an exclusive rural American boys school, where the pupils are made to swear by the ethos of 'Tradition, Honour, Discipline, Excellence.'.  In walks John Keating (Williams), who introduces a radical approach to educating his pupils that clashes with the staid traditionalism of the school, a process which eventually leads to tragedy...The film is without a doubt exceptionally well made.  It is very well shot, acted and directed and is a consistent pleasure to watch.  The main problem is with the storyline and characters, both of which remain quite cliched and don't possess ambiguity or depth.  With the exception of Keating (and a slightly liberal-minded colleague) virtually all the adults are harsh and repressive with no explanation as to why they are this way, or why they stick so rigidly to their positions.  Only a few of the boys in Keating's class are given much personality, and the rest are filler characters whom we learn very little about.  Rounding them all out would have maybe taken longer, but would have made the film more interesting.The film's main strength is the actors.  Ethan Hawke's Todd and Robert Sean Leonard's Neil get the lion's share of the screen time as Keating's two chief pupils, and they make the most of it.  Hawke is a lonely young man neglected by his rich parents, and Leonard is a sensitive creative soul with a frustrated passion for acting.  Both actors clearly depict the thin line of tragedy running through these spoiled young boys very well.Of the adults, Kurtwood Smith is on fine form as Neil's tyrannical father. Alas, his part is that of the standard mean old father and he's never given any background.  Nevertheless, Smith really makes the audience hate him within his limited amount of screen time yet when he tells his son to become a doctor not an actor, you can't help feeling he has a point.Make Miss Jean Brodie a man while removing her fascistic undertones and you have the essence of John Keating.  The problems with the character are the same with all the others, yet Williams overcomes these and makes Keating a sympathetic, passionate and likeable man.  The film livens up whenever he is onscreen.  In conclusions, 'Dead Poets Society' is a very sophisticated, well acted film.  Regardless of the lack of depth, it remains an enjoyable film experience.",Null,0,1,25 February 2004
The Hustler," Enjoyable pool drama
","This drama about an up-and-coming pool hustler was said to be the model for all the formulaic sports movies, like 'Rocky' and 'The Karate Kid', that have appeared since. But 'The Hustler' is different from it's imitators due to a tragic, ironic edge to its plot. Whilst it's a popular saying that every loser wins, the hero of this film learns the hard way that sometimes when you win, you lose.Fast Eddie Felson (Paul Newman) is a young, arrogant pool shark regularly playing other would-be glory hunters for up to thousands of dollars a game. Eddie's ambition is take on and beat the long-time pool champion Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason). But in his first match with Fats, Eddie gets too cocky and his rival gets the better of him. Obsessed with getting a return match, Eddie gets involved with a sleazy manager (George C.Scott) who tries to develop in Eddie the 'character' necessary to defeat Fats. Things are complicated when Eddie falls in love with a lonesome alcoholic Sarah (Piper Lawrie), an affair that eventually leads to tragedy...The film succeeds through a flowing blend of great acting and tight scriptwork. Although the film meanders inconsequentially through it's love story, the performances and memorable dialogue ('Fat man you shoot a great game of pool') ensure an engaged viewer. Pool fans too will enjoy the array of trick shots on display here. Paul Newman was taught by billiards legend Willie Mosconi, while Gleason himself was already a very telented pool player.Paul Newman is on top form as the talented but tortured Eddie, while Piper Lawrie engenders sympathy as his fragile, weak-willed girlfriend. George C.Scott is brilliantly dislikeable as Eddie's scheming manager, while Jackie Gleason plays Minnesota Fats with a quiet subtlety. In his hands the pool king is not really a villain, but just an honest, hardworking professional.Despite it's slow pace at times, this is still an immensely enjoyable, well-acted drama. 'The Hustler' spawned a sequel over twenty years later with 'The Colour of Money' (1986).",9,3,4,28 January 2005
Juno," Great plot and acting, over-rated dialogue
","An independent movie featuring a rising independent star in the talented Ellen Page, 'Juno' is an interesting and original take on the popular teen movie genre. Aiming for humour and poignancy, rather than soap-opera style drama or gross-out laughs, 'Juno' succeeds through a great story and some strong performances.The film centres on tough-talking but sweet-natured Juno MacGuff (Page)as she deals with falling pregnant after a one-night stand with a shy schoolmate Bleeker (Micheal Cera). Not in a rush to become a mother at sixteen, Juno enlists the aid of two adults Vanessa (Jessica Garner) and Mark (Jason Bateman) who promise to parent the child once it is born. As time wears on and Juno comes to term, fate throws up a few unexpected surprises and Juno is forced to make some really hard decisions...The acting in this film is top-notch, no question. The ever-reliable J.K Simmons ('Spider-Man') is on fine form as Juno's wise old dad, Cera is gently believable as her boyfriend and Jason Bateman turns in a fine performance as Mark. As opposed to Juno, who is wise beyond her years, Mark is really a child who has yet to fully grow up and Bateman captures this superbly.Ellen Page has won a round of awards and an Oscar nod for her turn as the eponymous Juno, yet although it is a good performance, it is not the actress's best. She was better in 'Hard Candy', and I think she should have gotten an Oscar nod for that film instead. But this is not to degrade her work in 'Juno' however as she is still sweet, smart and funny in her role.Oscar winner Diablo Cody has gathered much praise 'Juno', which is her first ever screenplay. Her much-vaunted dialogue was to me a little too clever, as nearly every character in the movie makes classical or pop culture references. There are so many of them that pretty soon they fail register with the humorous effect intended. Far better is her actual plot, as Cody offers through her story an original take on the teen movie. There are virtually no stereotypes in her script, and I was impressed by the last-minute twist at the end. If Cody can apply her excellent story-telling technique on show here to other ideas and other movies, she will hopefully have a great career ahead of her.Probably the least serious and least pretentious of this year's top Oscar contenders, 'Juno' is well worth your money and your time.",7,4,12,26 February 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Diminishing returns but still good fun
","The Pirates of the Caribbean series comes to an end here with a case of diminishing returns. The action and fight scenes are as spectacular as ever, but this instalment is oddly devoid of wit. It's a flaw from which it cannot recover.Depp, Knightley and Rush turn in their usual fine performances and the scene is set to the pounding theme score that really livens up the whole thing.It cannot compensate for an overly complex script and consequently overlong running time that knocks the wind out of the film's sails and slows it down.Disappointing.",6,0,3,28 May 2007
X-Men," Good balance of character and action (spoilers)
","Having now spawned a hit sequel (the first, so it has been said, of many more), the original 'X-Men' film possesses a solid balance of action sequences and well-rounded characterisation.  Director Bryan Singer has cleverly crafted the story as an allegory for prejudice and racism that still exists in modern America.The film begins in World War II in a Nazi concentration camp where a young boy, segregated from his parents by German soldiers, causes hysteria when he discovers an ability to manipulate and weld metal with his bare hands.Flash forward into the near future, and the US Senate is debating a motion detailing the segragation of 'mutants' - human beings born with special abilities or powers.  Overseeing this debate is Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), an aged telepath who believes that mutants and humans can peacefully co-exist.  The good Professor runs a school where young mutants learn to develop and control their unique abilities.  Also keeping watch is his old friend Erik Lensherr/Magneto (Ian McKellen).  Magneto does not share the Professor's beliefs and is all too aware of the corruption and cruelty of the human race, as experienced during his time as child prisoner of the Nazis.  In this, he devises an ingenious plan which he hopes will teach humanity a lesson...The storyline and writing are excellent, taking the Professor and Magneto as two individuals conceiving two vastly different solutions to the same problems of fear and prejudice.  Where as the Professor believes in a peaceful resolution and contented co-existence, the bitter Magneto practices hate and revenge.  Loosely tied in with this is the role politics plays in creating the kind of atmosphere and social climate that produces individuals like Magneto.  The story is carefully laid out and structured and the ending leaves more than one loose thread hanging for tying up in future films.The performances in the film are all enjoyable and distinctive.  Patrick Stewart is quietly dignified as the Professor, and Ian MacKellen gives a very sympathetic portrayal of Magneto.  You do feel for him, in spite of his actions.  Australian Hugh Jackman plays Wolverine, who heals fast and sprouts slashing metal blades from his hands.  Wolverine is a hard-bitten but sympathetic loner with a mysterious past who functions as the film's answer to Han Solo, providing a line in both sex appeal and wise-cracking humour.  Anna Paquin is Rogue, who can drain the life out of anyone she touches.  Paquin conveys well the confused and vulnerable aspects of this character.Other notable characters include Famke Janssen as telepathic Jean Grey and Rebecca Romjin-Stamos as seductive, chameleonic mutant Mystique, although we could have explored James Marsden's Cyclops and Ray Park's Toad a little bit more.  'Star Wars' fans will be quick to spot a nod to Park's turn as Darth Maul in 'The Phantom Menace' in this movie.Special effects and action sequences are kept restrained but good set-pieces include a fight in a bar, a sequence at a train station and the finale atop the Statue of Liberty.  The sequences make good and convincing use of flo-mo and CGi effects.Along with 'Spider-Man', released two years later, this is a fine modern example of how to make a fantasy action picture entertaining and exciting without compromising the need for characterisation.  A pity this film's sequel did not follow it's predecessor's example.",Null,0,0,18 June 2003
Spider-Man 3," Entertaining enough, but far too long
","The third in the popular Spider-Man trilogy suffers from the law of diminishing returns. The universe introduced and expanded upon in the first two movies is not as fully fleshed out, nor are the characters (old and new) that we meet throughout the story.Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is about to propose to his life-long love Mary-Jane (Kirsten Dunst) but, as his alter-ego Spider-Man, has to first contend with three villains: his best mate Harry Osborn (James Franco) has assumed the identity of the New Goblin in an attempt to avenge his father's death at the hands of Spider-Man; his uncle's killer Flint Markoff (Thomas Haden Church) is on the loose, and after a bizarre genetic accident is transformed into the terrifying Sandman; plus a strange otherworldly toxic substance that takes over Peter's Spider-suit and brings out his darker side. As Peter Parker, he must compete with a rival photographer at the Daily Bugle Eddie Brock (Topher Grace) as well as Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard), a supermodel who fights it out with Mary-Jane for his affections...The over-loading of characters into the plot means none of them are explored in any great depth. This is a bizarre anomaly given the length of the picture, which clocks in at well over two hours. This means the movie is far, far too long and the audience I saw it with with almost certainly getting bored with many actually leaving the cinema before the picture had finished.That said the action sequences are exciting enough and the humour, for the most part, is well judged (I would, however, have edited out that irritating British female reporter at the climax). The best action scenes see a fight between Spider-Man and Sandman in the sewers of New York City, Spider-Man's rescue of Gwen from falling off a building, and the climax set in a high-rise construction site.Maguire fares well enough as Spider-Man but there is little more he or Kirsten Dunst as Mary-Jane can do with their roles. Franco seems to enjoy himself as his character comes full circle and the ever-delightful J.K Simmons provides much of the laughs as J.Jonah Jameson. Willem Dafoe makes a brief but terrifying return as Norman Osborn, but none of the other actors are given a proper chance to develop their roles and their presence, as a result, is somewhat flat.After watching this well-intentioned but inevitable tired effort, I couldn't believe that Sony are already commissioning three more Spider-Man movies. There is certainly a market for them, judging from the box office, but I wouldn't bank on any of them being an improvement on what's gone before.",Null,1,2,7 May 2007
The Terminator," Strong combination of story and action make this a winner: spoilers
","Released in 1984, 'The Terminator' featured a then-unknown Arnold Schwarzenegger in the principal of an emotionless, seemingly invincible killer cyborg.  The film is viewed today as cult classic, and watching the film makes it very easy to see why.In 2029, mankind has become overrun by cyborgs, who rampage throughout Earth, killing humans wherever they find them.  Two warriors are sent back through time to 1984 with the aim of finding Sarah Connor, whose as yet unborn son will be mankind's saviour in this apocalyptic future.  The first warrior is the Terminator (Schwarzenegger), sent back by the machines to kill Sarah Connor before her son can be born.  To protect her, the human resistance sends back a lone warrior, Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn), who has a bigger role to play in humanity's future than he first believes....As the film is set in the Eighties, alot of the hairstyles and fashions give it a very retro look when looked at now.  This is never more apparent when the Terminator stalks Connor at a nightclub, where teens and twenty-somethings bop away under the tacky neon disco lights.The story and script are very inventive, relying very heavily on building suspense rather (as the sequel did) on slightly overblown, big-budgeted action sequences.  The main core of the story is the relationship between Connor and Reese.  Whilst romantic liasons come as part of the package in films like this, the time-travel side to the storyline gives their relationship a clever and unusual twist.This is helped by the central performances of both Biehn and Hamilton, who give their characters development and depth.  Biehn is initially scarred but resourceful, before we see his more vulnerable, emotional side.  By comparison, Hamilton begins the film as a scatty, bumbling waitress and ends it a very tough and embattled woman who is forced to stand alone.Completing the trio of principal parts is Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator.  Largely walking through the part with a cold menacing stare, and uttering sparse (but highly quotable) dialogue, he is a unique and memorable presence in the part.Special effects, particularly the model effects, seem a little dated and unconvincing now, but these are used very sparingly as Cameron directs the action scenes (the aforementioned disco scene and the final chase sequence in a hydraulics factory) with his trademark precision and flair.Along with its 1991 sequel, 'The Terminator' is still a fine example of how the traditional action movie elements of sex and violence can still be great entertainment when fused with a superb story.A classic.",Null,1,1,30 January 2003
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Weakest of the classic trilogy but still enjoyable fun (major spoilers)
","Coming out three years after the dramatic high that was 'The Empire Strikes Back', 'Return of the Jedi' had a lot to live up to.  Satisfactorily sorting out the various plot lines left dangling, as well as delivering a rousing conclusion to the series, was a tough test for the series' creators.  In spite of a much weaker script and some less than enthusiastic acting in some quarters, 'Return of the Jedi' comes out on top featuring its fair share of enjoyable scenes, both fun and dark.It's been six months since Han Solo (Harrison Ford) was frozen in carbonite and shipped off to the palace of Jabba the Hutt, an alien gangster he double-crossed.  The film begins on the desert planet of Tatooine, where Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) hatches a plan to rescue his friend.  Later, the rebels head to Ewok-inhabited Endor to destroy the Empire's new Death Star, where Luke must confront his father Darth Vader (David Prowse, voiced by James Earl Jones) while resisting the manipulative temptations of the dreaded Emperor (Ian MacDiarmid)...The script and acting in this one is visibly below par.  Many of the principals are lacking the passion and enthusiasm they displayed before. Carrie Fisher, as Princess Leia, and Harrison Ford are especially disappointing, as is Billy Dee Williams as Lando, his ambiguous character from 'Empire' now just another do-gooding rebel.  To be fair to them, they are hampered by a script that does not develop their characters and instead gives them alot of banal stilted dialogue.  This combination, however, cripples a number of important scenes (Luke's talk with Leia about his mother).Only Mark Hamill as Luke really gives it a fair go.  He may not be as convincing as a controlled, self-possessed Jedi Knight than he was as a naive young rebel, but he's still on form.  David Prowse and James Earl Jones again create the role of Darth Vader, and oversee well the character's conversion from dark villain to redeemed saviour.  Ian MacDiarmid makes a suitably creepy Emperor, although it is hard to reconcile his almost alien visage here with his more human appearance in the recent prequel films.
There are some great action scenes here but the biggest standout, dramatically, is the Death Star lightsaber duel between Vader and Luke, as the latter very nearly succumbs to his psychotic dark side.  The battle on the forest planet of Endor, with the rebels and the teddy bear-like Ewoks, is also good but in a more lighthearted manner.  All actions scenes benefit from excellent special effects and some superb editing.Of the 1997 re-releases, this was the most significantly revised of the three films.  Creator George Lucas added a musical number to the scene in Jabba's palace, and reworked the ending, showing the inhabits of various planets (Tattooine, Bespin and Coruscant) celebrating the demise of the Empire.  The Ewok's celebratory song was also rewritten.  The film benefits greatly from the alterations.In spite of some inherent flaws with script and acting, this is still a worthwhile motion picture and sends the series out on a high.",Null,0,1,1 April 2004
Alien," Strong plot hampered by weak characterisation (spoilers)
","A massive hit spawning three high-grossing sequels, 'Alien' is now said to be the model for every space-set horror movie.  Unfortunately, the film does not quite deserve such an accolade.  For while it does have an excellent plot and superlative special effects for its time (the film has not dated too much, either), the main characters lack depth, inhibiting our sympathy with them when they're inevitably killed off.In an unspecified time at some point in the future, the crew of cargo ship Nostromo are in deep sleep on a journey back to Earth.  Woken up half-way there, they are forced to investigate a signal from an uncharted planet, having been told they will lose their wages if they don't.  They discover a derelict spaceship and inadvertantly bring a deadly alien life form back on board their ship....The basic storyline, by Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett, is very strong and contains alot of great set-pieces.  The best of all is when crew member Kane (John Hurt) dies in the infamous 'chest-bursting' scene and the numerous futile attempts by the remaining crew members to track down and kill the monster.The alien itself is a very impressive design, although perhaps it could have looked a little less humanoid.  The inclusion of several deleted scenes could have helped establish the creature's motivation, psychology and capabilities alot better.  However, fully explaining these is a problem that occurs not just in Alien but in it's sequels as well.The set-design is gloomy, detailed and claustrophobic and given a sense of lived-in reality.  The alien ship in particular is a fascinating organic design, and it is odd how the sequels have never returned to explore it further.  All of this is well accentuated by some well-orchestrated music that carefully builds an atmosphere of fear and impending doom.The film is certainly alot slower than most films of it's type today.  The slow careful buildup in the beginning and the quite measured approach to some scenes makes today's horror pictures seem very rushed by comparison. However, this is a flaw when you have a set of characters as mundane as the ones here.A strength of the sequels to this movie is the distinctiveness of the characterisations, the lack of which is a problem here.  Almost none of the characters fully engage the audience and, with the exception of Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and eventually Ash (Ian Holm), no character has any development or agenda at hand.  The problem is not so much with the acting, but with the writing.  Most of the lines in the films are interchangeable between characters.  As a result, the film tends to drag whenever the eponymous alien is not on-screen.A superb technical achievement, but the weak writing and characterisation would improve in subsequent films.",Null,0,1,23 May 2003
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Brilliantly horrific masterpiece of film
","Tim Burton and Johnny Depp collaborate yet again for a ghoulish masterpiece of entertaining film-making that dazzles and disturbs right from the get-go.It's Victorian London and Depp is Benjamin Barker, a barber from the city wrongly exiled from England on a prison ship after the callous Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) takes a fancy to his wife. Returning to London after fifteen years, Barker adopts the name Sweeney Todd. With the aid of Mrs Lovett (Helena Bonham-Carter), a beastly pie-maker, and his cut-throat razors, Todd embarks on a murderous, bloody rampage of revenge...Fantastic cinematography that uses subtle shades of black and white and muted colours really adds an edge and creepy atmosphere to proceedings. It contrasts well with the literally buckets of red blood that come pouring forth from the throats of Todd's hapless victims.The script, based on Stephen Sondheim's famous musical, has been adapted flawlessly for the film. There is some well-written characterisation with enough twists and turns apt for this kind of melodrama, and the well-performed songs possess enough wit and tragic irony to be effective.Despite sporting the same accent he used for Captain Jack Sparrow in the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' series, Depp nicely avoids comparisons with his signature role. He makes Todd dangerous yet sympathetic and we feel for him throughout, despite the fact he's basically a serial killer. Helena Bonham-Carter, Burton's wife, is also excellent as pie-maker Mrs Lovett who has a grisly secret of her own. Her ultimate fate is terrifying, but there is little doubt she has it coming. Alan Rickman as Judge Turpin and Timothy Spall as his henchman both turn in fine performances. It's nothing we haven't seen from either of them before, but they're still good. Sacha Baron-Cohen, of 'Borat' fame, has a fine cameo as a rival barber and Jayne Wisener is pretty and enchanting as Todd's long-lost daughter Johanna. There's a girl who's going places.A brilliant and lush Gothic treat, and an absolute must for Tim Burton fans.",9,0,0,25 June 2008
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," A brilliant follow-up (warning: spoilers below)
","Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones is a fine follow-up to the underrated 'Phantom Menace'.  But whereas that film was a very lightweight film, this sequel possesses more action, more humour and more darkness, with a little bit of romance thrown in for good measure.Set 10 years after Episode I, 'Clones' sees the once great Galactic Republic falling apart due to a band of separatists.  When these separatists make several attempts on the life of Senator Amidala(Natalie Portman), her two Jedi friends from the past, Anakin Skywalker(Hayden Christensen) and Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan MacGregor) are assigned to protect her.  While Anakin accompanies the Senator to Naboo, where the two fall in love, Obi-Wan tries to find out who is trying to kill her and why, in the process uncovering a sinister plot to overthrow the Republic............Performance-wise, the actors have much more to play with this time around and are better for it.  The principal romance between the Anakin and Padme actually works very well, due largely to the sizzling chemistry between Christensen and Portman.  They overcome some rather clunky dialogue to make their relationship in the least believable.  Christensen, as the future Darth Vader, is slightly stiff but delivers the goods when the occasion really demands it.Ewan MacGregor also has more fun this time around (especially with his 'death-sticks' scene).  Providing the villainy is Christopher Lee, memorable as rogue Jedi Count Dooku (his lightsabre duel with two-foot tall Jedi Master Yoda is a certified crowd pleaser), as well as Ian MacDiarmid, back as manipulative politico Palpatine.The script is a lot better this time, throwing in alot of crucial exposition that will be important to remember for Episode III.  Yet at the same time, it is intelligent, it does try to develop the characters and mythology a little bit more and does not treat its audience as stupid.  Even the comedy moments, while cheesy, come off effectively.The special effects are less decorative this time around and do more to contribute to the storyline.  The last few scenes, helped by John Williams rousing score, are good examples of this, carrying as they do a sense of tragedy and impending doom.No where near good or as fresh as the original 'Star Wars' but good fun nevertheless.",Null,0,1,20 June 2002
Forrest Gump," Beautifully imperfect commentary on America
","Hailed as a classic when it first came out, 'Forrest Gump' now appears to be looked upon as a travesty, a shallow celebration of America's innocence. Yet this retrospective view is somewhat missing the point.  For while the character of Forrest Gump is portrayed as being genuinely innocent, the American 'innocence' he represents is not, nor is it ever intended to be.In this, the film works well both as life story and as unique commentary on the last 30 years of American history.  As played by Micheal Connor Humphreys and then Tom Hanks, Forrest Gump is a slow-witted but good hearted young man raised in Greenbow, Alabama by his feisty housekeeping mother(Sally Field).  Forrest's good intentions, his ability to run at great speeds, as well as his love for his abused and misguided best friend Jenny (who grows up to be Robin Wright) drive and define his life.  Forrest goes to college, enlists for the US Army and survives a posting to Vietnam and his various encounters with prominent historical figures, including JFK. Forrest recounts all of this to others whilst sitting on park bench awaiting a bus.This is far from a perfect film.  The many numerous spottable gaffes and mistakes put the Academy to shame for naming it Best Film of 1994.  The digital effects have dated, as has the tinkering of the various real video footage.  Yet this is largely superficial when considering the film's graces.The film's direction and use of music for scenes are very good in places, particularly for the scenes in Washington D.C with Forrest's triumphant reunion with Jenny after returning from Vietnam.Yet the film's defining point has to be it's acting.  Sally Field and Robin Wright give solid support; Field always the supportive and caring mother (who isn't above boffing the headmaster to get Forrest entry into a 'normal' school) and Wright as his loving, but self-destructive soulmate.  Gary Sinise also turns in a fine performance as Leiutenant Dan, who is crippled in Vietnam but whom, with Forrest's help, finds redemption and regains a sense of self.But this is Tom Hank's film.  However gushed his Oscar acceptance may have been, he did deserve the award for a performance that is alot more complex than first appears.  On the surface and to the core, Forrest is naive but essentially good individual.  Yet his park bench recollections continually undermine the idea of American innocence, rather than celebrating it.Forrest wistfully recalls his absent father being a member of the Klu Klux Clan.  Anyone with even a smattering of knowledge of American history will know the Clan were a gang of vicious white supremacists, rather than 'people who dressed up ghosts, or spooks or something'.  Forrest continually comments on the history he encounters in a very simplistic way that invites to both laugh at Forrest, as well as with him.This irony is repeated throughout the movie, even in throwaway moments. One such moment is Forrest and Leiutenant Dan's encounter with two whores in a bar just as New Year dawns on 1972.  One of the whores says with sadness in her voice 'Don't you just love New Years?  You can start all over. Everybody gets a second chance...........'Hank's triumph is to combine the ironic aspects of Forrest Gump with the genuine warmth and sentimentality that is a part of the character.  With his much-quoted lines and awkward body language, he evokes sympathy from the audience.  His best moments in this come when he tells Jenny 'I'm not a smart man.  But I know what love is', meeting his five year old son for the first time, and his final graveside speech to Jenny.Whilst 'Pulp Fiction', released at the same time and contrasted with this film, may be a witty and irreverent take on the grimy realities of American life, it cannot compare with the grand combination of irony and warm sentiment in 'Forrest Gump'.",Null,1,3,24 September 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Fantastic start to a great trilogy (spoilers)
","Now being hailed as one of the greatest fantasy trilogies ever committed to film, it is worth taking a look at Peter Jackson's monumental and hugely successful effort to bring JRR Tolkien's books to the screen.  Although the best plot elements of the plot are still to come, this first film gets the story off to a great start.In the vast continent of Middle Earth, Frodo Baggins is a contented little hobbit living in the lush green country paradise of the Shire.  He lives in Bag End with his uncle Bilbo (Ian Holm) and his best friend Sam Gamgee (Sean Astin) lives just around the corner.  But dark forces are on the move. The evil Lord Sauron (Sala Baker) is preparing to rule Middle Earth.  Along with corrupt wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee), he seeks the One Ring that will enhance his power and make him unstoppable.  This very ring resides in the Shire with Bilbo.  At the command of wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen), Bilbo bequeaths the ring to Frodo and so the quest to destroy the Ring begins...Much of the story credit naturally belongs to original author JRR Tolkien, who has created a rich complex tale around featuring hobbits, wizards, dwarves, elves, goddesses, orcs and the like.  Within a story as good as this, these elements are not cliched but are rich and interesting.  The Ring is depicted as a source of greed and corruption and it's fascinating to watch how this affects the characters.  One of Tolkien's flaws though, was to bog down his interesting narrative with largely superfluous events and the script does well in keeping these to a minimum.  As a result the story flows much better and is easier to follow.There is some fantastic cinematography in this film, featuring a seamless blend of sumptuous location shots and digital imagery.  The battles and daring escapes are very well done.  Highlights include a chase and battle through the mountain caverns and the final riverside swordfight.There is some great acting here.  Elijah Wood and Sam Gamgee are excellent as the chief hobbits, Wood in particular good at conveying the anxiety conflict of will which comes with his burden.  Both actors have abandoned their U.S. accents in favour of British ones.  This a good move and gives their characters a more natural feel.  Ian MacKellen and Christopher Lee are on form as the opposing wizards, their vintage British charm invigorating their characters.  Of the others, Sean Bean is on fine form as conflicted but doomed warrior Boromir.  Cate Blanchett isn't too bad either, as ethereal goddess Galadriel.A splendid start to a worthy series, as well as being an invigorating and enjoyable fantasy adventure film.",Null,0,1,2 February 2004
Grease," It should not work, but somehow does
","Now the subject of a UK-based reality TV show, as talent scouts look for stars to play the leads in a new stage production, 'Grease' is probably the definitive high-school movie musical. It's energy and light-heartedness has endeared it to generation after generation of fans.Danny (John Travolta) is an LA high-school student who has a brief summer affair with Sandy (Olivia Newton-John), a beautiful Australian girl. When the summer's over, Danny returns to school at Rydell High and the company of his gang The T-Birds and their girlfriends the Pink Ladies. When Sandy unexpectedly turns up at his school, it leads to a complicated, comic romantic journey...The movie should not work: the plot is flimsy and clichéd, nearly everyone is a walking stereotype and the cast of high-school students are played by twenty/thirty somethings. They should all look stupid up there, but they don't.There are three main reasons for this: first off is the catchy and outrageously memorable music: 'Summer Nights', 'You're the One that I Want' and 'Greased Lightning', to name but three, every song in the film has enough snap to get you singing and dancing. The use of stereotypes in the movie actually works: I don't think I know another movie with so many distinctive and memorable characters: from the romantic leads Danny and Sandy, and minor characters like brainless jock Chisholm and hyperactive supernerd Eugene, each one makes its mark.In today's world, with online communities like Friends Reunited and Bebo connecting people with their old schoolmates, the use of adults to play teenagers might actually strike a chord. The lighthearted and affectionate friendships in the T-Birds and Pink Lady Gangs, are played with a lot of humour and honesty, and will almost certainly bring out nostalgic feelings in the older members of its audience.This is why, for many people, 'Grease' is still the word.",9,2,4,23 May 2007
Footloose," Silly, but lighthearted caper
","'Footloose' is a fun and very lighthearted motion picture that promises a good time and delivers.The film has a simple, if unlikely, plotline.  Streetsmart but gentle teenager Ren MacCormack(Kevin Bacon) arrives from the big city with his mother in the backwater town of Bomont.  Enrolling at the local high school, he is appalled to discover the town's adults have imposed a law on 'public dancing' and rock music, as enforced and practiced by the local preacher(John Lithgow).  Ren quickly sets about changing things, falling in love with the preacher's daughter Ariel (Lori Singer) in the process.The story is a little unlikely yet it is perfectly suitable for the teenaged audience at which it is pitched.  The script takes some time to explore its simple theme - dancing and rock music, and what they symbolise for young people.  Three scenes help to lay this out.  The first sees Ren dancing by himself in a barn; the town meeting where Ren presents his case to the townspeople and explains to them the meaning of the dance; and the final prom sequence in which the teens of Bomont revel in their newfound liberation.As the leading man, Kevin Bacon carries off his role very well.  Ren isn't really a macho hero revelling in coolness, he's a down-to-earth young man trying to the right thing by his peers.  His romance with Lori Singer's character Ariel is formulaic but perfectly inoffensive.
The film could have perhaps done with a little more nastiness to fully contrast against Ren's earnest intentions.  Even Ariel's brutish boyfriend(Jim Young) fails to inject much tension in this respect and the final fistfight between him and Ren comes across as being a bit lame.John Lithgow's characterisation is very good but it is a little too subtle. As the town Reverend and preacher of all things pure and holy, his extreme views come across not so much as puritanical, just merely uptight.  The change that eventually occurs in his attitudes is hinted at very early on. The result is that he is nowhere near is frightening or intimidating a character as he could have been.  At the same time his troubled relationships with his rebellious daughter and quiet wife(Dianne Wiest) are very well written and acted.  In these scenes he excels and his character's development seems very natural.On the technical side, the film is well-shot and the gloriously Eighties soundtrack complements the proceedings very well, bringing the necessary exhuberance and bounce to the whole movie.Whilst 'Footloose' is certainly no masterpiece, it succeeds in being a lighthearted knockabout caper, and as such is a very enjoyable movie.",Null,50,78,24 June 2002
The Color of Money," Great, poignant sequel to 'The Hustler'
","The Eighties, in a trend that seems to be repeating itself this decade, saw a raft of sequels to hugely popular movies, one or two of which were to films made more than twenty years previously. One of was 'The Colour of Money'. It features an iconic film character in Fast Eddie Felson, is shot in colour where the original was shot in black and white and for both these reasons offers a very poignant portrayal of this character in showing him in a new light.When we last saw Fast Eddie Felson (essayed once again by the great Paul Newman) he left the game after deciding that the ruthless business of big-time pool playing was simply not for him. Since then, he's gone into selling whisky and being the backer for one or two minor-league pool players. Despite this, he still hasn't picked up a cue in over twenty years. Eddie encounters Vincent (Tom Cruise), a young pool player who reminds him of what he used to be. Thinking he might be onto a good thing, he takes Vincent and his girlfriend Carmen (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) to a big-time pool competition in Atlantic City, coaching the young man on how to be the best. But watching Vincent in action rekindles Eddie's passion for pool, with dramatic consequences...The drama is paced very differently this time out, and is brilliant in that it brings the character of Fast Eddie Felson full circle. You don't really have to be familiar with 'The Hustler' to enjoy 'The Color of Money' but if you are, it really enhances the viewing experience. It is interesting watching the conflicting triumvirate of Eddie, Vincent and Carmen as Eddie not only coaches Vincent but also coaches Carmen on how to coach Vincent.Director Martin Scorcese seems to enjoy the pool playing parts of the movie even more than 'The Hustler' director Robert Rossen, with the camera taking the view-point of both the cue-ball and the nine-ball, and delighting in the fast-moving action on the table. There are some terrific trick shots on show here, and the full-colour cinematography works better for the game of pool than black and white. The film has a fantastic soundtrack that captures the atmosphere of the pool halls and also the journey of Eddie himself.Tom Cruise is well-cast as the cocksure Vincent, even his incessant grinning becomes downright irritating at times. Mastrantonia is sexy and streetwise as his girlfriend Carmen, a woman far wiser than her boyfriend but sympathetic to his sweetness. There are some great supporting roles from John Turturro as the hapless player Julian, Keith McReady as the slimy pool champion Grady Seasons and a young Forest Whitaker as hustler Amos.But the film belongs to Paul Newman as Fast Eddie, winning an Oscar for the role this time out (he was previously nominated for 'The Hustler'). He believably portrays the same man and the character's journey from manipulating Vincent for his own ends to playing him to regain his self-respect, is mesmerising. He's played Butch Cassidy, Hud and Cool Hand Luke but Fast Eddie is far and away his definitive signature role.'The Color of Money' is a great sequel and a fantastic sporting drama.Recommended.",7,0,0,3 April 2008
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Not quite up to scratch with the first two, but still entertaining(spoilers)
","After the superlative first two 'Terminator' films, there seems to be little need for a third movie about the eponymous cybernetic assassin.  Yet this is what director Jonathan Mostow has produced, to surprisingly positive acclaim.  While this effort is certainly not a classic in the same league as its predecessors, 'Terminator 3' is still an entertaining and inventive sci-fi thriller.John Connor (Nick Stahl), once set to be mankind's future saviour, is now a computer hacker in his early twenties who lives on the road by his wits. His mother Sarah (the Linda Hamilton character from the first two films) has died of leukaemia since the events of the last film.  Unbeknownst to him, the apocalypse he thought he'd averted several years ago is nearly upon him. And once again he finds himself the target of two Terminators: one out to protect him, the other to destroy him.  The nightmare begins again...The film's main strength is its excellent array of action sequences and effects.  Highlights include an inventive truck/car/bike chase sequence, a showdown in a weapons factory, a chaotic but oddly eerie shootout in a mortuary/graveyard, and the final confrontation in a desert retreat.The acting is a quite mixed ranging from good to merely adequate.  Nick Stahl is good as John Connor, but does not bring enough depth or pathos to the role.  Claire Danes is on fine form as his romantic interest, and has a good relationship with her tragic father (David Andrews).  Sadly there is a lack of romantic chemistry between her and Connor that leadens too many dramatic scenes.As for Arnie, well, he said he'd be back and he is.  Not once looking self-conscious or uncomfortable, Schwarznegger slips very easily back into the role that made him a star.  With the actor's recent foray into US politics, this is likely to be his last role for some time.  He handles all action and dramatic scenes very well.  It is both surprising and endearing that an actor of limited range like Schwarznegger can add depth and substance to what is mostly a one-note part.  Kristinna Loken is his new opponent, a T-X who simulates radio signals and whose arms can turn into rapid-firing machine guns.  With a lithe figure and menacing stare, Loken has a sinister screen presence.The script here is OK, but nothing special and could have done without the pointless self-referentialism.  The story is very good, though, and presents us with an unexpectedly gloomy ending that sets the stage for further films.'Terminator 3: Rise of Machines is not perfect but possesses enough action and just enough substance to make it a worthwhile flick.",Null,0,0,19 January 2004
American Beauty," Surreal, clever drama (spoilers)
","At one point, a character in this movie remarks 'There's nothing worse than being ordinary'.  She's later brought down to earth when she's told she is just that.  Looking the very idea of what it is to be ordinary in middletown, suburban American, and gleefully yet soulfully turning it upside down is the essence of 'American Beauty'. True, it is not the only film to have done this. 'Edward Scissorhands' is one example, the first 'Scream' movie is another.  Yet this film possesses a witty, ironic sense of humour combined with a vividly powerful streak of sexuality that makes it stand out from the crowd.  As presented, the beautiful middle class haven of tree-lined drives, lovely houses and pretty white picket fences creates a materialistic environment inhabited by jaded, alienated people living in deadened, fragmented relationships.The main protagonist is our narrator Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey), an advertising executive who on the surface seems perfectly content but in reality is genuinely unhappy.  He hates his job, his daughter Janey (Thora Birch) hates him, and he's trapped in a passionless marriage to Caroline (Annette Bening), an uptight, neurotic real estate agent.  An encounter with his daughter's petite best friend (Mena Suvari), reawakens his lust for life and he sets about changing things, not necessarily for the better. Meanwhile his Janey has developed a curious attraction for Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley), the strange boy living next door...The film is very beautifully shot, and key moments are well accentuated by a gentle, haunting music score.  But the strength of this film is in the characters, brought to life by a terrific script and some superlative acting.Kevin Spacey is very good as Lester Burnham, livening his sheer inertia with a cutting, wise-cracking flippancy.  Spacey captures his gradual transformation from bored corporate drone to liberated middle-aged adolescent with relish and a quiet depth.  Wes Bentley is only slightly weaker as Ricky.  At times he's a little too smug and self-centred to be completely likeable, but his street-smarts and articulate, subtle emotion just about overcome that.Thora Birch is thoroughly likeable as Janey, and makes her character's awakening interesting and convincing.  Birch is very well cast, as she's beautiful without being overtly glamourous.  Her attraction to Ricky is as much psychological as it is physical.  Ricky likes her for her earthy nature and unshowy beauty.  She is attracted to his honesty, his ability to see beyond the superficial, as well as his gift for finding beauty in simple, random events like a plastic bag floating in the wind.The usually innocent seeming Mena Suvari enjoys herself here playing a contemptuous, voracious little slut.  Yet even she finds some kind of redemption before the movie's end.  Annette Bening is brilliant as Caroline, a once vibrant young woman who has become a miserable obsessive, forever taking herself and her life too seriously.With these well-etched portraits its difficult, if not to like, then to at least empathize with these characters.  This remains the strength of this surreal and thought-provoking motion picture.",Null,0,1,4 April 2004
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Solid but slightly overblown sequel: spoilers
","By 1991, Arnold Schwarzenegger had become an international action movie star.  So naturally, any sequel to the movie that helped make his career was going to be hit.  Thus was born 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day'.The film is helped by the return of the film's main principal stars: Schwarzenegger himself, Linda Hamilton and director James Cameron.  The result is a top-level sequel, much more expensive than the original, but nevertheless is far better than anyone had a right to expect.The basic plot is something of an update on that of the original.  This time the target is not the mother but the adolescent son.  When the film opens, John Connor (Edward Furlong), is now living with foster parents.  His mother Sarah (Hamilton) is confined to a mental institution, knowledge of mankind's future annihalation having driven her nearly insane.Sent back this time are two cyborgs: one is a T-100 (Schwarzenegger), a Terminator reprogrammed to seek out and protect John Connor.  His adversary is the considerably more lethal T-1000 (Robert Patrick), a liquid metal assassin who can blend in with his environment and whose fingers and arms can form lethal stabbing weapons.In an interesting twist, the script works in the creation of the cyborgs and a bid to avert apocalypse.  At the centre of this is a hardworking but naive scientist (Joe Orton) whose research will unwittingly trigger Armageddon. Sarah's attempts to stop him add another layer of tragedy and pathos on to an already interesting script.The sequel takes the inventive step of creating a family bond between the principal characters.  On finding John, the Terminator takes his charge to rescue his mother and together the trio form an touching connection between each other: John the son, Sarah the mother, and the Terminator the watchful surrogate father.The acting by the principals is once again excellent.  Hamilton in particular has really made the effort here.  As Sarah Connor, she's become enraged, angry and psychotic, with an impressive muscular physique to boot. Edward Furlong, in an underrated debut, is sympathetic and convincing as her son.  Robert Patrick is on fine form with the little acting he has to do as the T-1000.  Earl Boen is wonderful as Sarah's smarmy but helpless psychiatrist, and Joe Orton conveys tragedy and pathos as the doomed scientist.But the film, without a doubt, belongs to Arnold Schwarzenegger.  As well as becoming the good guy, his role is considerably humanized this time round. At one point, he's even made to put his hand up and say 'I promise I won't kill anybody.'  This line is a good dig at Arnold's status as an invincible action hero, as well as tieing in with the film's anti-violence message.  He forms a genuine rapport with Furlong and, naturally, gets all the best lines.The special effects are far better than those used in the previous film, but they are used just a little too often.  A little carnage here and there is fine but too much becomes boring and repetitive.  As a result the film's pace lags in the second half.Perhaps not quite the classic the original was, 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day' is a good sequel to 'The Terminator' and would have made a suitable conclusion to the series.  As it is, we'll just have to see what surprises await us in 'Terminator 3: The Rise of the Machines'.",Null,0,0,30 January 2003
Edward Scissorhands," Moving fairytale (major spoilers)
","'Edward Scissorhands' is easily Tim Burton's best film.  It's bizarre and quirky subject material, and the approach taken to it, may not be for everyone.  Fans of gritty, realistic films or exciting action movies should probably steer clear of this.  But anyone who enjoys a gentle fairytale with a touch of social commentary thrown in would easily take to this.The tale begins with an old woman telling her granddaughter a bedtime story about a man with scissors for hands.  Moving into flashback, we meet Edward (Johnny Depp) an artificially created man whose inventor (Vincent Price) died before he could complete him, leaving him with protruding metal skewers where his hand should be.  Living in a dilapidated old mansion that overlooks a sunny suburban neighbourhood, Edward is discovered by Peg (Dianne Wiest), a kindly Avon lady, who takes him home to live with her family.Edward's hands make him an excellent hair-stylist and topiarist, and he quickly becomes the hot topic of gossip among Peg's neighbours.  But things are complicated by Peg's beautiful daughter Kim (Winona Ryder), to whom Edward becomes powerfully attracted...There is a splendid technical backdrop to this picture.  The use of blacks and greys in Edward's home contrast with the multicoloured pastels of Peg's neighbourhood.  Shot in Florida, the suburban environment is clearly very Seventies influenced, but not specifically so.  The result is a timeless, everyday feel that works very well as a backdrop for the characters. Keeping in with the absurdity,  Edward's mansion possesses Tardis-like qualities, being significantly larger inside than it is on the outside.The whole story is accentuated by Danny Elfman's magnificent score.  Through careful use of both string and choral sounds,  Elfman captures perfectly the tragic plight of the central character, as well as highlighting the so-called normality of the people he encounters.On a script and story level, this film has it all.  Edward is an inner extension of director Tim Burton (who co-wrote the story with Caroline Thomson).  Anyone who has ever felt like a freak or an outsider in life, or has something of a tortured artist in him, should be able to identify with Edward.  He acts as a metaphor for such people, and this is why his predicament is so very moving.The story goes further than this, though.  Through Edward, Burton exposes the little idiosyncracies and hypocrisies that make up suburban middle-class life.  Principal to this is the character of Peg, who despite everything going on around her, still clings (like her neighbours) to the hollow illusion of 'normal'.The characters are perhaps a little two-dimensional, but are given vivid life through some very colourful performances.  Johnny Depp is excellent as Edward, conveying innocence, pain and love often without any dialogue. Dianne Wiest is equally good as well-intentioned but misguided Peg, and especially enjoys playing the mother to Depp.  She is balanced out by Alan Arkin as her earthy husband.Winona Ryder, looking immaculate in blonde wig and white dress, is perfect as Edward's love and Ryder convincingly portrays Kim's increasing affection for him.  Anthony Michael Hall is nice and nasty as her greedy thug of a boyfriend.  Vincent Price, in his last movie, is fine as the sweet old Inventor.  All other performances are well-rounded out.Moving, funny and enjoyable, 'Edward Scissorhands' is Tim Burton at his bizarre best.",Null,0,0,14 August 2003
Spider-Man," Good but far from perfect superhero picture
","Following in the wake of 'X-Men', 'Spider-Man' sees the live action interpretation of another Marvel Comic book superhero to the silver screen. The results are far from from perfect but nevertheless interesting, and the very character-focused plot makes way for some fascinating possibilities for the inevitable sequel.The story is simple and gets down to action almost instantly: bookish, bullied schoolboy Peter Parker(Tobey Maguire) is bitten by a radioactive spider whilst on a school visit to a science laboratory.  After a while he develops some unusual abilities such super-strength and the power to shoot web-strings from his wrists that can allow him to swing between tall buildings.  Thus, Spider-Man is born.Meanwhile, misguided scientist Norman Osborne (Willem Dafoe) is working on a serum that will give him super-strength.  Working against the wishes of the military, for whom he created the serum in the first place, he tries the stuff out on himself.  He becomes demented power mad villain the Green Goblin and provides a fittingly insane opponent for Spider-Man.The script and story-line are actually very good and set up relationships that can be developed over the course of several films.  A curious love triangle is created between Parker, his best friend Harry Osborne(James Franco), Norman Osborne's son, and the love of both their lives Mary-Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst).  It is this that will very likely be the basis for the follow-up.This triangle is very well acted by the younger players in the film. Maguire makes for a tragic Spider-Man who, even as he accumulates and uses his superpowers, never quite loses his nebbish streak and is unable to tell Mary-Jane how much he really loves her.  Dunst is as beautiful as ever and creates a complex, well-rounded Mary-Jane.  Franco has little to do in this movie but gets a good last scene at the end of the film that smacks of promise for what is to follow.The film gets a chilling villain in Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin.  From the moment of his transformation, Dafoe captures the nuances and ticks of an increasingly desperate and imbalanced man.  This is notable in scenes where Dafoe literally talks to himself in a mirror.  This loses its edge only when he is in full super-villain get-up.  His lively and scary features obscured by a goofy, unconvincing mask, it takes away some of the relish inherent in his performance.With the exception of Dafoe, none of the older players are anywhere near as good as their younger counterparts and this detracts from some of the comic as well as dramatic moments in the plot.  J.Jonah Jameson is simply not funny enough as fast-talking news editor J.K Simmons.  After being attacked by the Green Goblin, Rosemary Harris descends into pitiably unconvincing screaming as May Parker while Cliff Robertson, as her husband, fudges the delivery of the film's most important line: 'With great power comes great responsibility.'  The three of them are no doubt very experienced and accomplished actors but it is just a shame their performances were less than adequate here.Action scenes are well choreographed, with enough punch-ups, explosions and people-in-peril to create plenty of thrills and tension.  The CGi used occasionally looks a little bit too cartoony but this doesn't detract as its a comic-book film anyway.As with the best films of its kind, this is accompanied by an excellent theme tune.  Chad Kroeger and Josey Scott's eclectic rock song 'Hero' perfectly complements the drama and cynicism in the film's plot.Not too bad a first outing for Spider-Man but, a la Superman, one suspects the sequel will be a huge improvement.",Null,0,0,19 August 2002
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," New director and new tone
","Alfonso Cuarvos takes over from Chris Columbus for the third tale in the 'Harry Potter' adventures. The plot has a more adult, ambiguous tone than it's predecessors, and Hogwart's feels less like a place of magical wonder and more like a creepy, haunted house that just happens to be a school.After performing a spell on his repulsive aunt, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) flees his home and relies on his old mate Ron (Rupert Grint) to help him back to Hogwart's. Word reaches Harry that Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped Azkaban prison. Black is meant to have had a hand in his parents death and is heading to Hogwart's to hunt Harry down...The casting in this one is a bit mixed. While the regulars (Emma Watson as Hermione, Coltrane, Smith, Gambon et al) do their parts well, they are let down slightly by Emma Thompson, who just seems embarrassed playing the kids' new psychic teacher. On the other hand Mark Williams is on form delivering some delightful comic exposition as Ron's father, and David Thewlis is very moving as a teacher who hides a dark magical secret. To anyone not familiar with Potter but know their cinema the presence of Gary Oldman may wrong-foot some into thinking he's the bad guy. He isn't, and his brief appearance continues a run of quality good guy characters from the actor.Another great sequel. Worth watching.",9,0,1,31 July 2007
Aliens," Excellent sequel surpasses original (spoilers)
","'Aliens' is an excellent sequel to 'Alien', surpassing it both in action and characterisation.  Director James Cameron has oomphed up the ante in thrills, scares and action but has not forgotten to create a cast of likeable (and not so likeable) individuals to whom the audience can relate.It is nearly 57 years after Ripley (again played by Sigourney Weaver) destroyed the creature (along with her ship) in the first film.  She's found floating in her escape ship, along with Jones the cat.  To her horror she discovers the planet where her ill-fated crew found the alien has been colonised.  When contact with the colony is mysteriously lost, she's talked into going back with a squad of trigger happy marines to investigate.  They find one survivor, a frightened ten-year old child Newt (Carrie Henn), and not one alien creature but a whole nest of them....The plot and pacing of the film is easily the best of the series.  The buildup, while not as relaxed as that of 'Alien', is done very well and Cameron does well to increase the horror before unleashing the aliens full-tilt.  The plot further successfully expands on the themes of the original, with the aliens creating their hive within the colony complex and using the inhabitants as hosts for future spawn (something hinted at in deleted scenes in the first film).  The story has an interesting Vietnam War parallel (affirmed by Cameron in an interview) with the indigenous aliens (the Vietcong) utterly confounding the technology and weaponry of the Marines (US military).  More relevant today is the suggestion (through the character of Paul Reiser's Burke) of the extreme moral corruption and exploitation that can occur whenever big business intertwines with politics.
The script is also much better this time around, giving us a gallery of distinctive but plausible characters who learn and develop throughout the course of the film.  This is enhanced by some very accomplished acting.  It is fascinating to watch Bill Paxton's initially gung-ho, macho Hudson descend into crazed hysteria when confronted with the invincibility of his foe. Michael Biehn successfully repeats his romantic lead from 'The Terminator', even if the chemistry between him and Weaver isn't quite as potent as it could be.  Carrie Henn is gentle but intelligent as Newt, and Lance Henrikson is quietly convincing as sympathetic android Bishop.The standout though is Weaver's Ripley.  Fully developed from the mere cypher she was in the first film, she comes through here as being the only one able to intelligently and assertively assess the gravitas of her situation.  She also forms a empathic motherly bond with the like-minded Newt.  Weaver excels in conveying all of these emotions, and the final rescue and fight for her surrogate daughter is all the better because of it.Cameron's work on the technical side of film is always superlative and this movie is no exception.  There are some well-edited fight sequences between the marines and the aliens, packed with impressive special effects.  The concluding showdown between Ripley and the Alien Queen is a winner.'Aliens', in the wake of its success, would give way to a strong but deeply flawed third movie and a decidedly unmemorable fourth movie.  But this first sequel was and remains the definitive entry in the series.",Null,0,2,27 May 2003
The Commitments," Likable drama (spoilers)
","Spawning a cult of imitations, and a highly memorable theme tune in 'Mustang Sally', 'The Commitments' is written by Ian Le Frenais, Dick Clement and Roddy Doyle, working from Doyle's novel of the same name. Director Alan Parker has worked with this sort of story before, in the film 'Fame' released 11 years earlier. That film saw kids from bleak, unforgiving backgrounds hotly pursue stardom in downtown New York. So it is here, with a rough-and-ready Irish soul band from working class Dublin.Local music salesman Jimmy Rabbitte (Robert Arkins) is disenchanted with the local music scene in his home town of Dublin. He decides to reinject some passion and soul into downtown life, and places an ad in the local newspaper saying 'Have You Got Soul? If so the World's Hardest-Working Band is looking for you.' A lot of door-slamming and lousy auditions later, he assembles his soul band. The group includes Decko (Andrew Strong), the pig-headed but gifted lead singer; the mad, veteran trumpet player Joey The Lips (Johnny Murphy), the group's mentor; and Bernie, Imelda and Natalie (Bronagh Gallagher, Angelina Ball and Maria Doyle), the group's feisty backing vocalists. Together, they form 'The Commitments', and set about redefining soul for modern-day Ireland...In true Parker style, 'The Commitments' is well shot, and captures the environment perfectly: the downtown skyscrapers, cracked, puddled pavements, run-down tenement blocks and noisy, boozy nightclubs are all filmed with uncompromising realism. The music overall isn't too bad, but 'Mustang Sally' is the standout. There are few who won't be humming 'Ride, Sally, Ride' when this movie is over.The plot is unconventional and thankfully does not fall into the clichéd, against-the-odds success story. Unfortunately the story careens around hopelessly but regains control in time for the ending, which is, as one character puts it, 'poetry'. The script captures the inflections and accent of working class Ireland but contains only one or two memorable lines and even then they're in the mouth of only one character. This limits the range of depth developed by the acting, which is very good nonetheless. Arkins is very much at home in as Jimmy Babitte, and Johnny Murphy imbues Joey with an earthy, mad relish that is a joy to watch. Bronagh Gallagher, Angelina Ball and Maria Doyle are tough and sexy as the three female singers. The cast also includes 'Star Trek' actor Colm Meaney as Jimmy's dad, and Andrea Corr (of Irish band 'The Corrs') as Jimmy's sister.Likable drama, and worth a look.",Null,3,6,25 August 2004
Quantum of Solace," Fun but emotionally uninvolving
","'Quantam of Solace' is a direct sequel to 'Casino Royale', and continues the portrayal of superspy James Bond as a deadly, psychotic agent who lives in a threatening and dangerous world.A car chase is the pre-credits sequence where Bond (Daniel Craig) takes the captured Mr White (Jesper Christensen) to be interrogated about his mysterious organisation. Bond is keen to do his duty and avenge the death of his one true love Vesper, who died at the end of the last film. Bond's mission takes him to Austria, Italy and eventually Bolivia and into conflict with a sinister environmentalist Dominic Greene (Mathieu Almaric), who wants control of the world's water supply...The film is a lot of fun and benefits from the strong performances of Craig as Bond and Judi Dench as his superior, M. Olga Kurylenko is his paramour with a deadly vendetta of her own, and she shines in a fiercely physical performance. However Gemma Arterton is a mere clothes horse as Bond's fellow agent Fields, and renowned stage actor Rory Kinnear is just a shade too young as M's aide, Tanner. Almaric is good is the main villain of the piece, though I would like to have seen more of Jesper Christensen as Mr White.The plot is comprehensible and exciting even if the action scenes are too quickly edited and as a result too hard to follow. The usual technical feats are on display here the stunts and special effects are as usual spectacular. For a series now grounded in realism, some of the technology used by Bond and his associates is incredibly advanced. The flat-table computer consoles, for example, come straight out of 'Star Trek'.Bond is definitely back on track and I look forward to seeing more of 007 in future pictures.",8,2,5,4 November 2008
Mamma Mia!," Good fun, but definitely more theatrical than cinematic
","I was much looking forward to seeing this film. I am a lifelong ABBA fan, but despite being a Londoner now I have avoided seeing the West End musical on which this film is based, because of the extortionate ticket prices. A cinema ticket, I surmised, would be much cheaper, and indeed it was.It's a simple enough story with Sophie (Amanda Seyfried), a young girl who lives on a Greek Island with her mum Donna (Meryl Streep) who is about to get married. Trouble is she doesn't know who her father is, and a quick rifle through her mum's diary brings in three possible suspects: Sam Carmicheal (Pierce Brosnan), Bill Anderson (Stellan Skarsgard) and Harry Bright (Colin Firth). To her mum's dismay, she invites them all to her wedding to find out which one it is...Loads of fun on offer here, with the campness of all these name actors belting out ABBA songs, some of them rather badly. Doesn't really matter in the end, though, it's all good fun and the scenic backdrop of the Greek Islands is superb. The only weakness is the whiff of theatricality about it all, despite some fancy camera tricks.Still, recommended for ABBA fans, cheaper than going to see the show and is decent night out over all. Make sure you see it with a big audience, though, as that's exactly what this kind of film demands.",8,2,4,13 July 2008
Batman Begins," Vivid re-imagining of the superhero
","When the Batman series crashed and burned with 'Batman and Robin', many thought the Dark Knight's cinematic adventures were over for good. But the series has now been reinvented with this new picture from revered independent director Christopher Nolan ('Memento'). This film does what it says in the title, giving a detailed study of Batman's origins.Essayed by Christian Bale, millionaire Bruce Wayne is first seen languishing in a downtrodden Asian prison. He is a tortured, haunted soul plagued by his pathological fear of bats, and how this indirectly prompted his rich parents murder at the hands of a random mugger, himself eventually destroyed by the corrupt system that created him.Wayne is recruited by Ducard (Liam Neeson), emissary of Ra's A'Gul (Ken Watanabe), leader of a gang of mystical international vigilantes known as the League of Shadows. Ducard trains Wayne in the shadow arts, who then returns to Gotham City, now rotting from within from crime and corruption. With the help of his family butler Alfred (Michael Caine) and the resources of his father's company, Wayne pieces together a new identity to tackle crime and injustice in Gotham City...Batman.The story is impressive, tackling a great many details and issues previous films left out. We get to see the training of Bruce Wayne, and how he creates the Batsuit, Batmobile and the Batcave, and where he procures the technology to do so. Even Batman's 'flair for the theatrical' is given satisfying explanation. The thematic emphasis has changed, however. Instead of vengeance, what Wayne desires is justice and harmony, and using his Batman identity to restore it to Gotham and himself.Keeping him in check are Michael Caine as Alfred and Katie Holmes as childhood sweetheart Rachel Dawes. Both actors make the best of their roles, although Caine comes off slightly better, using his natural Cockney charm to bring the butler to life. Gary Oldman is very good as Jim Gordon, one of the few straight coppers left in Gotham City.The villains are very well realized and worked into the plot. British actor Tom Wilkinson hams it up as Gotham's chief gangster. Cillian Murphy (who was in line to play Batman) is brilliant as slimy psychiatrist Jonathan Crane, who routinely drives his criminal patients insane in his identity of the Scarecrow. Liam Neeson's Ducard is a much darker take on his Jedi Master role in 'Star Wars'.Rounding out the cast are Rutger Hauer and Morgan Freeman as the chief executives in charge of Wayne's company. Respected British actors Gerard Murphy and John Kazek appear in minor roles.Technically, owing to the plot the film is almost unavoidably too long and occasionally the dialogue is inaudible in some scenes. But the fights and special effects are exceptionally good, and whilst Danny Elfman is gone, this film still gets a powerful, exciting soundtrack.If this is only the first movie, I can't wait to see what the sequels have in store if the standard remains this high.",9,2,3,24 June 2005
Saving Private Ryan," Realistic depiction of wartime battle (Major spoilers ahead)
","Steven Spielberg made his second historical visit to the time of World War II (following up from his acclaimed Schindler's List) with this tale of a group of American soldiers, assigned to find Private Ryan, the sole survivor of a family of brothers killed in the war.The group assigned to find him are world-weary Captain Miller (Tom Hanks); his right-hand man Sergeant Hovarth (Tom Sizemore); sniper Private Jackson (Barry Pepper); wise-guy Jew Mellish (Adam Goldberg) and translater Corporal Upham (Jeremy Davies), a bookish sort who's never been in battle...This ensemble is played by a gallery of seasoned natural actors. Tom Hanks gives probably his most subtle performance as the besieged Miller, capturing the dizzy tiredness of a man who's sick of fighting. Sizemore is fine as Horvarth and Pepper, Goldberg and Davies are good in their various roles, giving their stock characters a distinctiveness and humanity. Matt Damon is given the pivotal role of Private Ryan, and plays him in much the same way as he played Will Hunting: a petulant, obnoxious moron who does not engender much sympathy.The story, especially with reference to recent world events, feels like a US propaganda tool. Watching it, especially if you're uninformed of history, you'd think the Americans were the only ones fighting the Nazis. Other Allied Groups (the British, the French and the Russians) are never seen or referred to any way.Where the film really succeeds is in its portrayal of wartime battle, surely the most realistic depiction committed to film. The film is shot in harsh realistic tones, with a lot of grey and brown. The grime, blood and gore of combat is far from overlooked.The opening attack on Omaha Beach is excellent, and you can feel the frantic, fearful adrenaline of the soldiers as they rush into the line of fire and are randomly picked off one-by-one. The Germans who surrender in eventual defeat are randomly shot dead. The concluding battle to defend the bridge is even better as the characters we've come to know over two hours are decimated or worse than that changed by their ordeals. However it is not the guns and bomb battles that really convey the wasteful nature of war. It is the hand-to-hand combat scene Mellish has with a German soldier while Upham cowers on stairs. The German gets the upper hand and slowly forces Mellish's knife into his stomach, gently rocking him to sleep as he does so. This is what it ultimately boils down to: the savage nature of fighting, and possessing (or losing) the will to remain on your feet and stay alive. It is this reality, encapsulated in that scene, that the film captures so very well.It will not stand up as a historical document (few war movies do) but in bringing the realities of wartime battle home to a mass audience, 'Saving Private Ryan' is a must-see.",7,2,4,30 March 2005
X-Men: The Last Stand," Uneven but still quality ending to the X-Men series
","The conclusion to the X-Men series (discounting the 'X-Men Origins' franchise) is a quality film experience. Whilst lacking the touch and character involvement of the first two films, it's still an exciting ride.Scientists have discovered a cure for the mutant gene, leading to a violent campaign by Magneto (Ian McKellen) to halt it's production. He is opposed by Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), who must also contend with Jean Grey (Famke Jannsen), his former apprentice who has returned from the dead in a new, darker persona...There are too many new characters here and only a few of them have any effect. Kelsey Grammar's Beast is no substitute for Alan Cummings similarly blue-skinned Nightcrawler, and Ben Foster's winged Angel looks great but does not have much of a character. On the other hand, Dania Ramirez is sizzling as Callisto, Vinnie Jones plays it for laughs as musclebound Juggernaut and Ellen Page makes a great debut as Kitty Pryde. Her scene with Juggernaut is funny, and demonstrates the actor's knack for comic timing.Of the returning players, Hugh Jackman is still good as the rough-and-ready Wolverine (hence why he got his own film) and McKellen and Stewart stamp their usual gravitas on proceedings, although a scene where they're digitally made up to look young is unconvincing. Daniel Cudmore, Shawn Ashmore and Anna Paquin are great in their respective roles. Famke's Jean Grey/Dark Phoenix does not have very much to do, limiting her dramatic impact.The special effects and action scenes lack the touch of the first two but are still great fun. The finale in San Francisco is superb.Not a great motion picture, but still polished and entertaining enough to deserve a place alongside it's predecessors.",7,1,2,14 November 2009
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Excellent sequel that develops the characters (spoilers)
","In many ways, 'The Two Towers' is the most difficult of the 'Rings' trilogy, possessing the same problem as 'The Empire Strikes Back' in that it contains neither a beginning nor an end.  Indeed, the story of 'Two Towers' moves alot slower and goes through fewer events than its predecessor.  What it does do very well here is to develop the existing characters to the point where they're ready for what happens at the end.The group of warriors that set out to destroy the One Ring has collapsed and the survivors have been split apart.  Merry Brandybuck (Dominic Monaghan) and Peregrin Took (Billy Boyd) elude capture by the Orcs and flee into the woods where they discover Gandalf (Ian MacKellen) really survived his encounter with the Balrog dragon.  King-to-be Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) leads Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) towards the city of Rohan, which is in danger of being captured by the wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee) and his army.  Meanwhile, Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) proceed towards Mordor, intent on destroying the ring.  They're accompanied by Gollum (Andy Serkis), the Ring's former owner, a crazed, duplicitious creature hell-bent on regaining his 'Preciouuussssss'......It goes without saying that viewers will have had to have seen the previous picture to understand this one.  The interpretation of the book is accurate, although the key battle at the Helm's Deep sanctuary is given more emphasis in the film, and the final hundred pages have been clipped out for inclusion in 'Return of the King'.  The script holds the story up well, and does a fine job of exploring established characters whilst at the same time introducing new ones.Of the new characters, Bernard Hill is convincing as Rohan's King Theoden, conveying well the stature of an aged, embattled but natural leader. Miranda Otto makes a striking impression as his beautiful daughter Eowyn. Brad Dourif has an all-too-brief cameo as Saruman's creepy servant, Grima Wormtongue.Yet is Andy Serkis as Gollum who makes the most memorable character. Although Gollum's outward appearance is digitally generated, it is Serkis who provided both his movements and his voice.  He really makes the part his own.  Gollum is a pathetic, devious, snide, disgusting yet pitiably conflicted character.  He is positively a joy to watch.As for the others, Viggo Mortensen gets some good material as Aragorn, the quietly noble ruler-in-waiting caught in a love triangle between Eowyn and Arwen (Liv Tyler), his Elf lover.  John Rhys-Davies and Orlando Bloom develop a wonderful little-and-large comic rivalry as Gimli and Legolas. Wood and Astin are both good, painstakingly depicting the agonizing hardship of the two companions.Technically, the film is consistent with what has gone before. Cinematography maintains the distinctive blend of location and digital shots.  Notable scenes in this film include an eerie sequence across the Dead Marshes, the battle at Helm's Deep and the final onslaught on Saruman's lair.A good follow-up, with enough it to whet the appetite for 'Return of the King'.",Null,1,1,2 February 2004
Ghostbusters," A bona fide Eighties classic
","A wonderfully good movie, brilliantly reminiscent of the era in which it was made, 'Ghostbusters' is a bona fide Eighties classic.  Whilst it never quite succeeds as a comedy (it is only mildly funny at best) it possesses enough monstrous spooks and ghouls to scare and thrill, combined with some memorable characterisations and a really hip soundtrack.The plot centres in on three parapsychologists who study and investigate the supernatural at a New York University.  The trio consists of wisecracking womanizer Peter Venkman(Bill Murray), overexcitable engineer Raymond Stantz(Dan Ayckroyd), and the studious intellectual Egon Spengler(Harold Ramis).The trio are thrown off campus for their apparently wasteful research, and then decide to start a business investigating and eliminating the paranormal: 'Ghostbusters'.  Armed with proton packs and ghost traps, they battle the ghoulish and the demonic, setting the scene for a climatic show-down at the top of a haunted up-town apartment building.
There is some superb characterisation for a comedy film.  The three strong leads are ably supported by (among many others) Sigourney Weaver, who plays Venkman's reluctant love interest,  Annie Potts as their no-nonsense secretary, Ernie Hudson as a down-to-earth black man who becomes the fourth Ghostbuster, Rick Moranis as Weaver's nerdy neighbour and David Margulies as the bemused Mayor.  Whilst none of these characters are explored in any depth, they provide a colourful balance of personalities that is the core of the picture.The colourful and delightfully messy special-effects perfectly suit the picture and one feels they wouldn't be quite so effective if the film was made today with CGI.  They are complement with some excellent set-design ranging from the Ghostbusters' dilapidated fire-station headquarters, to the eerie and foreboding high-rise.The music of the movie is excellent as well.  Bernie Brillstein's soundtrack ranges from the casually jazzy, to the scarily operatic, with some of good use of disco music in some scenes.  It perfectly complements the picture. And few would deny Ray Parker Jr's theme tune is an infectiously catchy hit.The film was followed by an equally impressive sequel in 1989.  As it stands on its own, 'Ghostbusters' is one of the definitive American movies of the 1980s.  A exciting, and enjoyable fantasy picture.",Null,0,0,5 August 2002
Back to the Future Part III," Quieter conclusion with an unexpected Western twist (spoilers)
","After the frenetic pace of 'Back to the Future Part II', the speed has been slowed down, and the tone lightened up considerably, for this final part of the 'Back to the Future' trilogy set back in the Old West.  This allows for the usual time-travel high-jinks, better characterisation and even some references to popular Western films of old.Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) has ended up back in 1955.  Courtesy of a letter sent from the past, he learns that Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd), who disappeared in a freak accident at the end of the last film, spent his final days in the old West Hill Valley in 1885.  Retrieving the buried time machine with Doc's '1955 counterpart', Marty learns his old friend died after being shot in the back by Buford Tannen (Thomas F.Wilson).  He then vows to return to the old West, rescue his friend and get them both back to the future...The film works very well on a technical level, with some good Western-style variations on Alan Silvestri's memorable theme score.  There is a strong continuity, in plot and references, to the previous films.  The over-the-top, cartoonish style of the second film has been replaced with a more relaxed, romantic tone that eases the series towards it's conclusion. Special effects are as spectacular as ever, particularly in the train chase finale.The old-style Western setting allows for a lot of funny nods and references to Western films, particularly 'High Noon', 'My Darling Clementine' and, most memorably, 'A Fistful of Dollars'.  Marty passes himself off as 'Clint Eastwood' and when he refuses to face Tannen in a duel he's told: 'Everybody everywhere will say Clint Eastwood is the biggest yellabelly in the West.'The acting, on all fronts, is much better.  Fox completes his character's arc begun in the second film, as he finally learns the value of self-control and restraint.  It's interesting how in the first film he resolves his parents destiny, in the second his children's, and the third film he finally sorts out his own.  He also appears, with Lea Thompson, as his own ancestor. He has a cheesy Irish accent, but he still pulls the part off. 
Lloyd gets to do more than just play the mad scientist, allowing for a soft, touching courtship with Mary Steenburgen as the local schoolmarm.  They have a good scene together where they share their love of Jules Verne.  Thomas F. Wilson makes for a slaveringly good villain in the gun-toting Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen.What is really interesting is the themes running throughout the series which comes to head here.  Marty learns about self-confidence and self-control and Doc, as he explains to Marty (as well as, indirectly, the audience) says that 'your future hasn't been written yet. No-one's has.  Your future is whatever you make it.  So make it a good one.'And thus ends this clever, fantastic and enduringly popular series of films.",Null,3,3,19 August 2004
8 Mile," Brilliant and compelling but not for everybody
","I first saw '8 Mile' a few years ago when Eminem was still hugely popular as a rap artist. I didn't like it very much, and I was largely bored throughout. But now I am involved in the spoken word scene in London, and witnessed live some actual rap battles (as of yet I have not summoned the balls to actually take part in one). So it felt it would be appropriate to revisit the movie, so I rented it out in DVD. I was well impressed.Eminem plays Rabbit, a young man living and working in Detroit where he has a job at a mechanics plant. His only passion is for hip-hop rhyming slang, at which he excels, and routinely takes part in the rap battles that take place at his local club. But problems at home with his trailer trash mother (Kim Basinger), a spunky but unfaithful girlfriend (Brittany Murphy) and fist-fights with rival rappers, grind Rabbit into the ground as he prepares to face his doubts and engage in the battle his life...I am now better able to appreciate the courage and the brilliant skill that goes into these rap battles, so I really enjoyed these parts of it. The film nails the atmosphere of the battles perfectly, with a well-choreographed and spirited crowd of extras. The drama in Rabbit's life with his friends and family is carefully and realistically portrayed but is REALLY harrowing and I found these scenes difficult to watch.It is safe to assume that the story is based on Eminem's own life story, and though it follows a well-worn theme, produces a couple of unexpected surprises. Rabbit is a white man operating in a world dominated by blacks, yet it's fair to say that while the black man may be oppressed and the white man privileged in other areas of life, the reverse is sometimes true and so it is here.Eminem acquits himself perfectly playing a version of himself, and his performance makes the movie. He is surrounded by a gallery of excellent supporting players who are all superbly well-cast. The cinematography really captures the gritty seediness of the setting and the movie is great to look at.Perhaps you need to be a fan of hip-hop or spoken word in general to really appreciate this, but it's still a very compelling picture.",8,0,0,14 December 2008
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Best so far
","'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix' is the best one so far. David Yates, the fourth director to take on the franchise, has upped the stakes considerably introducing a grander scale, epic feel and (even for Harry Potter) a considerably top-heavy cast.Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) faces opposition for his fifth year at Hogwart's. Not only is Lord Voldemort, his parent's killer and dark wizard, returned from the dead, no-one except Dumbledore (Micheal Gambon) believes him. The Ministry of Magic, who do not believe Harry, appoint Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) to oversee the school's Defence Against the Dark Arts. But she's really there to make sure Harry keeps quiet about Voldemort. After she tortures him for opening his mouth, the boy wizard mounts a rebellion...Harry grows up a lot in this one, and seriously takes matters into his own hands here, mounting an army and taking on Voldemort with the aid of his friends. Great scenes include Harry's mock trial near the beginning of the movie, Dumbledore's (Michael Gambon) escape from the Ministry (this scene features the film's best one-liner) and the final battle with the fiendish Voldemort (a snarling Ralph Fiennes).Gary Oldman is brilliant as Sirius Black, being more than just a head in a fireplace this time and providing some poignant moments in the movie. An under-used Helena Bonham-Carter appears as Black's loopy sister Bellatrix Lestrange. Radcliffe is as good as ever, as the earnest boy wizard, and Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are on fine form as Ron and Hermione. The scene where they discuss Harry's first kiss is a comic highlight.The cast is top-heavy right down to the minor roles. 'Balamory' star Miles Jupp has a blink-and-you'll-miss-him role as a TV weatherman while prominent theatre actress Kathryn Hunter appears as Harry's neighbour Mrs Figg. Incidentally Hunter was on double-duty shooting this picture, as she was playing the role of 'Yerma' at London's Arcola Theatre at the same time. The production took a week out of performances so she could go and film her scenes for the movie.The final scene falls just short of being mawkish but holds back enough to leave you begging for next year's episode 'The Half-Blood Prince'.",9,0,0,31 July 2007
Pretty Woman," Sentimental fluff (spoilers)
","'Pretty Woman' isn't too bad a picture for the very early 1990s.  Though it's two principals have been better, they have been an awful lot worse. They don't set the screen alight, but they have enough chemistry to just about sustain this two-hour Hollywood fairytale about a businessman and a hooker.Richard Gere plays it straight as a New York broker who visits Los Angeles to finalise a hostile takeover, then gets lost in downtown LA when he borrows his friend's car to get to his plush hotel.  Stopping on a street corner, he asks for directions from a plucky prostitute (Julia Roberts) who talks her way into his car.  Taken with her gutsy charm, he asks her to keep him company for the week.  A strange and unlikely love affair quickly develops...The script is a fairly straightforward boy-meets-girl, boy-loses-girl, boy-gets-girl-back-again sort of affair.  The dialogue is filled with the standard characters and cliches for this sort of thing (including the usual sources of comic relief) but contains one or two interesting lines.  Gere makes a funny analogy between businessmen and hookers - 'We both screw people for money' and there is an intriguing observation about musical opera.Richard Gere can be smug and vacuous onscreen sometimes, but happily that isn't the case here.  He is warm and restrained, and gives his character some credible depth.  Roberts, initially seen as an ugly duckling prostitute, quickly blossoms into a stunning beauty and her onscreen charm and winning smile are enough to carry her through.  In other roles, Hector Elizondo is a hoot as the camp hotel manager, and Jason Alexander is appropriately slimy as Gere's business attorney.  Laura San Giacomo, as Roberts' vulgar best friend, strikes the only bum note.The film is well accentuated by a decent Nineties score that includes the title track 'Pretty Woman' and the Roxette hit 'It Must Have Been Love'.'Pretty Woman' is a harmless, sentimental piece of fluff that should appeal to anyone who enjoys a good fairytale.",Null,2,3,22 August 2004
Titanic," Spectacular recreation of famous historical event (major spoilers)
","The tale of the doomed ocean liner Titanic remains continually ripe for cinematic exploration.  Films, series and documentaries continue to abound on this most famous tragedy.  Encompassed within the simple tale of the demise of an 'unsinkable ship' is a story of intense tragedy (over 1,500 lives were lost), social divide (the rich/poor gap was highlighted here when the first class passengers were the first on the lifeboats, leaving many in steerage to die) and most of all, of man's arrogance and opportunism overwhelmed by the forces of nature.If anyone could bring this tale into 21st century (when it was only 1997!) it had to be James Cameron.  Cameron had the technical experience and flair necessary to build and sink the Titanic onscreen.  Sex and violence are par for the course in almost every action movie but, like his special effects, Cameron inventively works these elements to make them serve his story.So it is with 'Titanic', where he uses a pair of doomed, starstruck lovers as a focal point for the audience to empathise and relate to the passengers on the ship.  The film begins in the present day where a diamond-hunting mercenary Brock Lovett (Cameron regular Bill Paxton) stumbles on a picture of a nude young woman wearing the diamond he is trying to locate.  Lovett is shocked when a very old lady (Gloria Stuart) identifies herself as the woman in the picture.  She comes aboard his vessel and relates to him and his team her experiences on Titanic.Cut back to 1912 and Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet) boards the ocean liner Titanic a sullen rich young woman.  She's being pushed by her mother (Frances Fisher) into a loveless marriage with Cal Hockley (Billy Zane), a vain self-centred tycoon.  The deadening misery of her life leads her to attempt suicide, but encounters Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio), a penniless artist who won his ticket in a poker game.  He saves her life, and they fall in love. But despite all their efforts, the affair cannot last,  especially when the ship strikes an iceberg and with not enough lifeboats, it's a race for survival...Cameron is especially keen on highlighting the class divide between rich and poor on Titanic.  The rich are shown as staid, self-centred and repressed, caring only about their money and their social status.  By contrast, the poor are shown as lively, honest, down-to-earth and fun.  The depiction is crudely stereotypical, but it works in favour of the story.  When they're locked below decks during the ship's sinking, you empathize with them and want them to get out.  Once the iceberg is sighted, no shot is wasted in cranking up the tension. Every aspect of the ship's sinking is seen, from the initial iceberg impact to the flooding corridors, the on-deck chaos as passengers struggle to board the lifeboats, to the grand final sinking.  Cameron further shows the aftermath of the sinking, with hundreds of survivors screaming and thrashing in the water as they slowly freeze to death.  All this works through superlative cinematography, special effects, editing, all underlined by James Horner's worthy music score.  The human element is not lost amid the action.  Leonardo DiCaprio is not rough-and-ready enough to really convince as a seen-it-all poor boy, but makes a good go of it, and is well partnered with Kate Winslet, who makes for a buxom, comely Rose.  Billy Zane (as Cal) and David Warner (as his manservant) make for slick, hateable villains and Frances Fisher brings Rose's mother a step up from simple caricature.The fictional characters blend in well with the real passengers, all of whom don't possess much depth but are still very well acted.  Standouts include Jonathan Hyde as the opportunistic Ismay, Kathy Bates as Molly Brown and Victor Garber as the ship's sympathetic architect.When the film returns to the present, you really do feel as though you were on Titanic, and it's hard to suppress a tear at the misty, dreamlike finale.Epic, and unforgettable.",Null,2,3,20 August 2004
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Wonderful adventure for children
","I have not read any of the Harry Potter books and I only watched this movie as part of a study. The film has left me wondering what I've been missing out on. This is a fantastic and intelligent adventure, and I cannot wait to get stuck into the others.Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is hideously neglected by his aunt and uncle at home and in his bed under the stairs longs for a much better life. It comes when he receives an invitation to fulfil his destiny as a great wizard and join the Hogwart's school, which trains magicians and wizards...Splendid production values really bring Harry's world to life and the script bounces along with a fair old pace and produces, especially for people who don't know the book, a fair few surprises. Along with Daniel Radcliffe as the eponymous hero, he is given good support from Rupert Grint and Emma Watson as his friends. Robbie Coltrane, Michael Gambon, Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman turn in terrific star performances that create memorable characters without overshadowing the young performers.I am looking forward to getting more familiar with this franchise. This was definitely a great starting point.",9,0,2,11 May 2007
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," The battle begins..
","British director Mike Newell helms this one, and there is a uniquely British touch to proceedings, most notably the presentation of the Quidditch World Cup, the appearance of Doctor Who star David Tennant, and a tent with Tardis-like qualities. And that's just in the first ten minutes...Hogwart's school becomes the base for this year's Tri-Wizards Tournament, where a pupil from each of the three main magic schools compete for the Tri-Wizard's Cup. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) becomes entered, leading to a battle with his resurrected old adversary Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes)...In this movie, the Potter story takes on a life of it's own. The plot is easily to follow (a not inconsiderable feat as the book is very long) and there are some fantastic set-pieces as Harry takes on dragons, vicious mermaids eventually, The Enemy.Acting is great, with Brendon Gleeson on fine form as new teacher Moody. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson, as Ron and Hermione, get to really flex their acting chops in a well played romantic sub-plot. Emma Watson has got an unfair drubbing from some critics, but she does herself proud here. Gary Oldman has a good returning cameo as Harry's godfather Sirius Black.The battle really does begin here...",8,0,1,31 July 2007
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Great continuing sequel
","'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets' picks up brilliantly where it's predecessor left off. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) has spent his summer cut off from his friends and living with his abusive uncle and aunt. Fortunately Ron Weaselly (Rupert Grint) arrives to whisk him away in a flying car to begin some new adventures at Hogwarts Academy...All the regulars return, including Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid, Michael Gambon as Dumbledore and Maggie Smith as Mrs McGonigall. Also back is Emma Watson as the boys' friend Hermione. Some terrific set-pieces abound as Ron's car has a tense encounter with Hogwart's Express train, an icky encounter with a forest full of spiders and Harry's duel with a giant snake...I liked Kenneth Branagh's turn as a cowardly braggart of a teacher, and the appearance of 'Tom Riddle' near the end. Aided by some fine music and colourful special effects this is a worthy cinematic continuation of the 'Harry Potter' story.",9,0,2,31 July 2007
Scream 2," Critic-proof sequel (spoilers)
","'Scream' (1996) was such a massive success that within a year, this sequel was made.  Given the clever, subversive nature of the first film, this sequel is almost critic-proof.  If anyone says this film is worse than the original, that would be countered by the idea that this is the point.  While not having the original's depth, this follow-up is equal to it's predecessor in term of shocks, suspense and cheeky humour.The action has moved from Woodsboro to Windsor College.  The events of the original have been turned into a film, 'Stab', and it is at a preview of this film that we meet two black Windsor students (Omar Epps and Jada Pinkett) who bemoan the lack of African Americans in horror films.  Within the noisy atmosphere of the cinema showing, the pair are abruptly cut to shreds.  Pretty soon the bodies pile up and Sidney (Neve Campbell) and other Woodsboro survivors find themselves hunted by a copycat killer...The film's status as a sequel precipitates an early classroom debate on that very same subject.  The only sequel unanimously agreed to being better than it's original is 'The Godfather Part II'.  All others, by their very nature. can only be considered inferior.  Later Randy (Jamie Kennedy) engages Dewey (David Arquette) in a short discussion on the rules of the horror movie sequel, where they also debate possible suspects.In the line-up this time round are Cotton Weary (Liev Schrieber), a former murder suspect exonerated by the revelations of the last film.  Reporter Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox), on the hunt for the prize-winning scoop, Sidney's boyfriend Derek (Jerry O'Connell) film student Mickey (Timothy Olyphant) and Gale's fan Debbie Salt (Laurie Metcalf) are all under suspicion.  The script by Kevin Williamson (who penned 'Scream') keeps things tight and plausible without convoluting his logic.  The killers, when revealed, are interesting surprises.  The main killer is a clever nod to the 'Friday the 13th' films, while the sidekick turns the point of 'Scream' completely on its head and offers to blame the movies for his actions.Cox and Arquette's onscreen courtship has lost none of its chemistry and Neve Campbell gives the film a strong central core as Sidney.  Jerry O'Connell gets a great singing scene as her ill-fated boyfriend, and Jamie Kennedy is once again superb as loveable geek Randy.  Metcalf, Schrieber and Olyphant are on fine form, and British actor David Warner has a good cameo as Sidney's drama teacher.  'Buffy' star Sarah Michelle Gellar, playing a student, adds to the irony of the piece by running away from the killer instead of taking the fight to him.Wes Craven ratchets up the tension in style, milking the most out of the plot twists.  The film (well scored once more by Marco Beltrami) is shot well around the ancient, red-bricked college campus that provides a creepy setting for the carnage.'Scream 2' is a superb sequel, and was followed by the comparatively average 'Scream 3'.",Null,0,0,25 August 2004
Jaws," Much-lauded classic (spoilers)
","An excellent combination of both action and drama, directed by Steven Spielberg with enthusiasm and flair, 'Jaws' is an intriguing and successful cinematic masterpiece.  It is one of those movies it is very difficult to write a review about, as so much has been written by now about the film's considerable merits.Set in the coastal island town of Amity, he film begins with a gently teasing sequence in which a skinny-dipping young girl is seized and dragged underwater by a mysterious sinister prescence.  Her remains are washed up on the shore the following day.  The local police chief Brody(Roy Scheider) registers the death as a shark attack.  Much to his frustration, the authorities refuse to acknowledge the existence of the shark.  As Amity is a tourist town, the council are afraid of the impact it might have on the summer season, the source of the town's income.  When they cannot the existence of the beast lurking off their beaches any longer, they hire the police chief, a mainland ichthyologist Hooper(Richard Dreyfuss) and a salty local fisherman Quint (Robert Shaw) to hunt and kill the shark....It is a well-known fact by now that the technical aspects of the film came about largely through necessity and lack of the kind of technology that is easily available now.  As a result, Spielberg did not show the shark for much of the film's first act, preferring to emphasise it's prescence through POV camera shots and John Williams pounding score.  Without CGI, the producers had to build a 25-foot shark replica.  It's easy to scoff at how fake it looks, but of all the models used in the 'Jaws' movies this is easily the most convincing.The film is well-staged and edited throughout.  The shark attack scenes are very carefully played and built up and a minimum of gore is used.  The dialogue scenes never drag, but slowly linger on certain characters allowing their flaws and idiosyncracies to show.  The final hour in particular is brilliantly staged, weaving in character development with the ever-impending threat of the shark.The script departs significantly from the Peter Benchley novel on which it's based.  This is especially true of the man vs. shark final hour, the very action-movie ending upsetting the author so much he had to be thrown off the set.  Other than that, dialogue is well-written coming naturally while simultaneously developing the characters.  A key scene in this respect is Quint's eerily told USS Indianapolis monologue.The performances are all first-rate.  Scheider is a find as the down-to-earth Everyman hero Brody, and Richard Dreyfuss gives a brilliantly nervy performance as scientist Hooper.  Stealing the film from both these two fine actors are Murray Hamilton as the town's greedy spin-doctor Mayor and Robert Shaw as likeable, but in the end embittered and bloodthirsty Quint.A standout classic film, one which it's three sequels hadn't a hope in hell of equalling.",Null,0,1,23 December 2003
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Fun ending to the Star Wars series
","'Star Wars' goes out with a bang in the last prequel, and the last cinema episode of the saga, 'Revenge of the Sith'. Whilst the film is filled with the usual in-jokes and incidental references that appeal only to hard-core fans, and the last-minute introduction of ambiguity into the otherwise clear-cut moral universe of 'Star Wars' reduces the emotional impact of the story, 'Revenge of the Sith' is in the main a great success.The Clone Wars begun in the last episode between the Galactic Republic and the Separatists are coming to an end. The film begins with a Separatist attack on Republic government planet of Coruscant and the kidnap of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid). Jedi Knights Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) rescue the Chancellor, killing off renegade Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) and confronting Separatist leader General Grievous (Matthew Wood) before making their escape.Back on Coruscant, Anakin discovers his secret wife Senator Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman) is pregnant. But he is later troubled by visions he receives of her dying in childbirth. This places in the centre of a power struggle between Palpatine, who offers Anakin the dark powers capable of saving Padme, and the Jedi who are suspicious of the motivations of the increasingly powerful Chancellor.The story is filled with thrilling set-pieces. The Clone Wars end, and Palpatine reorganises the Republic into the Empire, with himself as it's self-declared sovereign ruler. In promising dark power to Anakin, he reveals himself to be the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, who has orchestrated the war to place himself in a position where he can wield unlimited power - annihilate the Jedi. When Jedi Knight Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson) confronts Palpatine, the two engage in lightsaber combat with Palpatine feigning near-defeat in a successful bid to secure Anakin's allegiance.Heading to lava planet Mustafar to wipe out the remaining Separatist leaders, Anakin confronts first Padme and then Obi-Wan, while diminutive Master Yoda (Frank Oz) confronts the new Emperor in the Galactic Senate chamber. As Palpatine hurls Senate pod after pod at Yoda, one come almost see the walls of democracy come tumbling down. Obi-Wan defeats Anakin, who is reborn as Darth Vader. But the tragic Padme's twin babies may offer hope for the future...The script by Lucas is still a mixed bag. There is his usual stilted romantic dialogue, but he also allows for some timely political commentary on the balance between democracy and dictatorship.The much-criticised Hayden Christensen is good as the doomed Anakin, and there is a genuine warmth in the early scenes between him and Ewan McGregor, who matches the late Alec Guinness as Obi-Wan Kenobi. Portman is very good in her limited role as Padme, and it is she who is the source of much of the film's emotional resonance. Samuel L. Jackson is given more to do as Mace Windu and his death is cleverly made significant to the story.But this film belongs to Ian McDiarmid as Palpatine. Throughout the whole prequel trilogy, McDiarmid has had the most complex and by far the most interesting role, and here he cuts loose and enjoys himself as his character's evil nature finally erupts.Action sequences and special effects are up to Lucas' usual superlative standards, and do not disappoint. On a visual level, Lucas throws the lot at the audience. Every imaginable space battle or lightsaber duel has been realised on screen. Exhaustive it may be, but it's still great work.So that's it then, end of the line. 'Star Wars' is big, dumb, bloated and over-expensive but, what the hell, it's fun. With the proposed TV series, it will be interesting to see where it all goes from here.",8,2,5,22 June 2005
Sherlock Holmes," Great fun
","'Sherlock Holmes' is a terrific movie that, contrary to my expectation, captured the spirit and brilliance of the Arthur Conan Doyle novels. Although the trailers seemed to depict Holmes as morphing into an action hero, his detection work here is top-notch.The story, involving the villainous Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong) and his scheme to blow up the Houses of Parliament, is actually very good and supremely involving. Just when you think they have left a giant plot-hole it is explained away in the next scene. It is a great story on it's own, but leaves an exciting set-up for a possible sequel. Holmes' nemesis Moriarty (added during reshoots) is woven into the plot without detracting from it. But anyone expecting Brad Pitt to make an appearance (even post-credits) will be disappointed.Robert Downey Jr. is brilliant as Holmes - flamboyant, eccentric and coldly logical he fills the role sublimely. Jude Law is good fun as Watson, and Mark Strong makes a terrific villain. Rachel McAdams and Kelly Reilly are appealing as the love interests for Holmes and Watson, and Eddie Marsan makes a good fist of the bumbling Inspector Lestrade.The sets and CGI backdrops are also skilfully crafted and deliver a real Victorian flavour. Some fantastic action scenes abound, with a thrilling finale atop Tower Bridge.I don't want to give away too much, but watching this will certain whet your appetite or curiosity about the Sherlock Holmes books.A joy to watch.",9,0,4,31 December 2009
Scream," Witty and subversive horror movie (spoilers)
","'Scream' opens with a suspenseful ten-minute prologue where a plucky young teen (Drew Barrymore) is menaced by a mysterious phone-caller (a sinister Roger L.Jackson provides the voice) who quizzes her about scary movies.  The threats quickly escalate into bloody carnage as the girl and her unlucky boyfriend are quickly gutted.  This scene is a perfect summary of what is to follow: suspense, gore and horror movie references - within a horror movie.The setting is the white middle-class country town of Woodsboro, and the characters who quickly realize they are caught up in their own 'scary movie' are high-school geeks Stu (Matthew Lillard) and Randy (Jamie Kennedy), local stud Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich), perky blonde Tatum (Rose McGowan), and her best friend Sidney (Neve Campbell), whose mother was murdered only a year before.  Getting involved in the chase for the killer are bumbling local cop Dewey (David Arquette) and ruthless tabloid TV journalist Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox).  Anyone of these characters could be a suspect, and if they're not a suspect, they're a target...Neve Campbell radiates strength and intelligence as the heroine of the piece.  Courteney Cox, the compulsively neurotic Monica in TV's 'Friends', turns in some good work as the ambitious Gale Weathers.  David Arquette is appealingly goofy as Dewey, and he and Cox have a great chemistry together. Ulrich, McGowan and Lillard are all excellent in supporting roles.  'Happy Days' Henry Winkler has an unbilled cameo as the high school principal.The characters' self-awareness makes them unique for horror movie victims, and the script plays off this with funny consequences.  The keynote speech here is in the final party scene where Randy (brilliantly played by series' favourite Jamie Kennedy) lays down the rules of surviving horror movies: never have sex, don't drink or do drugs and never say 'I'll be right back'. Needless to say, these rules are bent and broken with abandon.Beneath that, though, there is a subtext about the supposedly safe middle class environment the characters inhabit.  The film's setting, the fictional borough of Woodsboro, has a very utopian look, with wooden houses, white picket fences, and clean, well-built schools and offices.  Director Wes Craven delights in showing us the ugliness hidden within the beauty of these surroundings, well-accentuated by Marco Beltrami's haunting score.But such perfection can never really be true, so long as the surroundings (however beautiful) are inhabited by human beings with human issues.  It is just such a setting like Woodsboro that creates bored, spoiled, desensitized people, a minority of whom may very well take to extreme violence as a means of enjoying or escaping their lives (the Columbine massacre is a good real-life example).  The constant horror-movie references are amusing but in the end irrelevant.  No matter how safe or perfect an environment seems to be, human impulses, always hidden beneath the surface, will threaten and undo the safety of that environment.  That is the real message of 'Scream' and one which it's closing song, SoHo's 'Whisper to a Scream', captures very well.'Scream' was followed by two sequels, and then was shamelessly ripped off by a parody imitator, 'Scary Movie'.  But above all of that, this first film remains the original and best.",Null,4,5,25 August 2004
Back to the Future Part II," Enjoyable, but cartoonish (spoilers)
","Darker, faster and with a greater emphasis on thrills and special effects, the second part of the 'Back to the Future' series is a complete change of pace from the original.  There is still plenty to enjoy here but much of the characterisation and wit of the first film has been lost.Picking up exactly where 'Back to the Future' left off, Marty (Michael J. Fox) and his girlfriend Jennifer (Elisabeth Shue) travel with Doc (Christopher Lloyd) to Hill Valley in the year 2015 to stop Marty's children from ending up in prison.  While there Marty picks up a sports almanac which, if taken back to the past, could make him rich through placing bets. But things turn complicated when the book is stolen by Marty's arch-nemesis Biff Tannen (Thomas F.Wilson), who runs off with it in the time machine. Returning to much-altered 1985, where a super-rich Biff has married Marty's mother (Lea Thompson) and rules Hill Valley, Marty and Doc must go back to 1955 to destroy the almanac and save the future...The whole film is slickly made, well-paced and contains some well-directed fights and chases.  However, right from the start the story has many problems.  Trying to work out the many time paradoxes in the story is headache-inducing, and the story replaces the careful characterisation of the original with a lot of cartoonish ideas.The 2015 version of Hill Valley is the 80s on steroids, and much of the aging makeup for the characters is too garish and over-the-top to be convincing.  In one scene, Michael J.Fox simultaneously plays the older Marty, Marty's son and (most ludicrously) Marty's daughter.  On a brighter note, this film's kicks off a character arc for Marty that will be resolved in the third film.But most intriguing is the chilling elevation of Biff from simple small-town bully to psychotic, power-hungry arch-villain.  The scenes where he rules Hill Valley from atop his luxury hotel are over-the-top but this doesn't matter too much, courtesy of some good acting by Thomas F.Wilson.  From thereon in, the pace doesn't flag.  The final scenes in 1955, where Marty races against Biff to destroy the book, are spectacularly well-directed and lensed in flawlessly with the events of the original. 
The acting is variable from so-so to over-the-top, but Christopher Lloyd and Michael J.Fox hold the thing together and stop the plot from becoming completely incomprehensible.After the breakneck speed of this second instalment, the series slows down for it's conclusion in the lighthearted, romantic 'Back to the Future Part III'.  As it is, this is the weakest and least convincing of the trilogy, but it is still an entertaining film provided you don't think about it too much.",Null,2,4,18 August 2004
The Queen," It shouldn't work, but it does
","Making a film about Princess Diana's death less then ten years after the event seemed to me a little bit crass, especially it features people who are not only still alive but very familiar to us: in particular the Queen herself, her family, not to mention Tony Blair. But by now the film has been covered in so much glory and plaudits, I thought I may as well see what all the fuss was about.I thought it worked well. Helen Mirren acquits herself very well as the Queen, giving a very human dimension to the monarch. The other main characters are brilliantly realised: Sylvia Syms' daft but still regal Queen Mother, James Cromwell as a pompous and old-fashioned Prince Phillip and Alex Jennings playing Prince Charles as a weaselly fop. Writer Peter Morgan has respectfully kept the two princes out of it, and asides from a brief bedroom scene where Charles breaks the sad news, they are not seen. The spectre of Diana lingers heavily over the movie, and as an audience we understand the Royal's conflicted attitude towards the Princess, fighting through their personal dislike of the woman to try and understand the public's admiration for her.I enjoyed Mark Bazeley's representation of Alastair Campbell. Not only does he look almost exactly like the real man, but presents two sides to the character, both as a cynic scornful of the royals and a sleazy opportunist making the most of a terrible situation.The real standout though is Micheal Sheen as Tony Blair. At first glance, the portrayal is only two steps away from yet another comic send-up, but Sheen takes the character on a journey here. He shows how the crisis allows Blair to become infatuated with the monarchy, sowing the seeds of self-delusion that will eventually prove the ruin of his premiership. Though this isn't the first time Sheen has played the role, I would like to see him do so again and develop his portrayal further.Peter Morgan's script gets the balance right between comedy and drama, and turns out what proves to be an incisive historical satire on British politics and the monarchy.Recommended.",9,1,1,10 April 2007
Any Given Sunday," An entertaining, if formulaic look, at American football
","For Londoners at this present time, 'Any Given Sunday', is a highly relevant movie. This story of a highly charismatic football coach at odds with his club's owners because they won't let him do his job is bound to strike a chord. The departure of English football manager Jose Mourinho (who managed Chelsea) over a fall-out with the club owner, was a great blow for English football. If any of the club's supporters, or indeed anyone who cares about the English game in general, is still reeling from that loss, then they can take comfort in the story of this movie.Granted, it's definitely not perfect. Director Oliver Stone takes rapid-fire, several-shots-in-a-second approach that doesn't always work, plus a great many minor but plot points and characters are slightly fudged in the delivery and don't register strongly enough.Thankfully this is overcome through some solid scripting and some commanding performances. There are a lot of great speeches in this movie, but they aren't delivered better then when they're delivered by Al Pacino (as coach Tony D'Amato) who has a way of making the words register while staying comfortably in character. His dressing-room speech before the final game has since become a film classic.He is ably backed by Cameron Diaz as the club's owner, who sees the team and it's star players as a cash cow to be milked for every cent she can get. Jamie Foxx is also brilliant as star player Willie Beamen and the brief scenes between him and his girlfriend Vanessa (Lela Rochon) are painfully believable.The football scenes are effective, particularly for their use of sound. You FEEL every charge, tackle and hit these players take, and it makes for some quite gruelling viewing. Music is also a strong factor in this movie, and it has possibly one the most memorable theme tune I have heard in years.Even if you aren't a football fan of any kind, the concluding pay-off in the end credits is unexpected but gently crowd-pleasing. Go D'Amato!",8,0,1,3 October 2007
Blade Runner," Solid, multi-layered science fiction (spoilers)
","Numerous books, magazines and essays have appeared on 'Blade Runner' (1982), a flop on its initial theatrical release, and one that it's star player Harrison Ford despised making. But the film, which appears on the surface to be just a straightforward science fiction thriller about evil robots, is in fact a far deeper tale about creation and humanity.In mid-21st century L.A, Deckard (Harrison Ford) makes routine cullings of rogue 'replicants', human-like robots engineered for slave purposes on Earth and off-world colonies. A small group of these robots, led by the charismatic Batty (Rutger Hauer) have infiltrated L.A. and it is up to Deckard to track them down and 'retire' them before they can do any damage...That at least, is the thrust of the story, which has one or two minor problems. The set-up to the final shoot-out is clumsily handled, and the final 'happy ending' feels out-of-place with the rest of the movie. However, there are many interesting depths to this picture.Batty's encounter with his doomed creator Tyrell (Joe Turkel) has a strong parallel with man destroying God in the pursuit of life. Deckard's affair with Tyrell's assistant Rachel (Sean Young), herself revealed to be a replicant, places his own humanity in an ambiguous light. Parallels are made between the replicants and their human creators in that the questions they both have are the same: who am I? where do I come from? where am I going? how long have I got?The backdrop to this is laid out in fantastic production design that blends futuristic technology (and some now dated corporate logos) with old style buildings. Deckard's apartment and Tyrell's high-rise office are influenced in their own way by the designs of Egyptian pyramids. This is accentuated beautifully by Vangelis's music score, including the touching Deckard/Rachel love theme.Ford is good in a role that is considerably more cowardly and stolid than some of his other action parts. Young radiates innocence and vulnerability as the gentle Rachel, and Rutger Hauer and Darryl Hannah are excellent as the two chief replicants, the former getting a memorable scene where she batters Harrison Ford with her thighs.Love it or hate it, 'Blade Runner' is a cult classic and should remain so for as long as films exist.",Null,0,1,8 September 2004
Before Sunrise," Lovely tale of romantic love
","I love this movie - a really inspiring, intelligent picture. No on-screen sex, no violence and very little swearing, this is a textbook example of a how to make a romantic movie.The simple story sees crazy but gentle American student Jesse (Ethan Hawke) met thoughtful, dreamy French girl Celine (Julie Delpy) on a train and they go on to spend the night in Vienna together, before Jesse has to catch a train in the morning.That's it. Okay, the pair of them encounter some interesting people on the way, including a palm reader, a pair of amateur actors and a poet but in the main it is all about them and how they connect with each other.The dialogue in this movie flows like a river, and it is all down to the touching chemistry between the two leads Delpy and Hawke, who connect and react to each other so fluidly it is difficult to believe what they're saying isn't real. Their dialogue is intelligent and they talk equal amounts of nonsense and truth at the same time. They have a great non-dialogue moment in a music shop, where they want to kiss each other but don't and the camera lingers on their mutual reactions.You would have to a have a heart of stone and a soul of lead not to fall in love with this movie, and let it re-energize your faith in love and life.",10,1,2,7 April 2007
X2: X-Men United," Abandons originals character-based approach in favour of more action and special effects(spoilers)
","'X2', made three years now after the original, is a slick, spectacular but in the end only passable sequel to X-Men.  This one has increased the action and special sequences to an almost numbing degree and intended developments in the storyline fail to bring it any further at all.  Worst of all, despite all efforts, this sequel does not give us the empathy with the characters that was a strength of the original film.  Still, it's not a complete loss and has one or two memorable moments.The story is now a few months on from the original, and the President has come no closer to passing his law regarding the registration of mutants. After a near-fatal White House attack by a blue-skinned teleporter (Alan Cumming), he sides with Stryker (Alan Cox) a military maniac with revenge and genocide on his mind...Elsewhere, Logan (Hugh Jackman) has come no closer to finding out about his past while the imprisoned Magneto (Ian MacKellen) craftily plots his escape...The storyline and script are not quite on a par with the original and there is a touch of a disappointment that the story has not really been brought any further and only leads to yet more set-up for future films (producers have revealed they intend to make at least three more).  Humour is also very limited in this film, deadening a great many scenes.The performances in this film are inconsistent.  On the plus side, MacKellen and Patrick Stewart (reprising his role as the benevolent Professor X) turn in their usual dignified performances.  Anna Paquin and Shawn Ashmore (as Rogue and Iceman) make a quietly convincing romantic couple.  The best performance is Alan Cumming as NightCrawler, who makes a colourful, zesty addition to the X-Men and is especially good when paired with Halle Berry's Storm.  Berry and Cumming are not an obvious pairing, the principal reason why their on-screen relationship works so well.However, neither Hugh Jackman or James Marsden (as Cyclops) add anything new to their roles.  Alan Cox is a major disappointment as Stryker.  He plays the role with just a little too much subtlety, to the point where he is unable to evince any menace or threat.  Famke Janssen's Jean Grey is given a more pivotal role in this sequel, but Janssen does not have the necessary range to make the audience sympathise with her character.  This is especially crucial in the film's closing finale.The action sequences are very many in this film, but notable standouts include Nightcrawler's opening attack on the White House, as he teleports and punches his way around numerous armed guards.  Best of all is Magneto's ingenious escape from his 'plastic prison'.  The action is a little overdone though, and a bit more restraint with these kinds of scenes would have maybe let them have a little more impact.  Whilst not without it's high points, it's the law of diminished returns for this follow-up.  Here's hoping director Bryan Singer recovers his form and delivers a more satisfying 'X-Men 3'.",Null,0,0,23 June 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Rousing but imperfect finale to the series (major spoilers)
","As far as epic trilogy finales go, you could do a lot worse than 'Return of the King'. As the closing chapter of the movie series, it is fantastically epic and sprawling. Yet at the same time, people who have read the original book will sadly have much to criticise in this finale both from what has been excised and what has been done, in some respects, with what remains.Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and Theoden (Bernard Hill) have return to Rohan with Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) to celebrate their triumph over Saruman (Christopher Lee, whose scenes were famously excised from this picture). However, they must prepare for Sauron's final onslaught at Minas Tirith, of which Aragorn is set to assume kingship. Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) quietly slip into Mordor, mindful of the scheming of the treacherous Gollum (Andy Serkis), who has a few surprises in store for the pair.....It is in the story and script areas that the quibbles arise. The ending celebrations, which take up the final twenty minutes, are a little too pat and Frodo and Sam's eventual return to the Shire too cosy, lacking the bitter irony that laced Tolkien's story. It would have served the film a whole lot better the ending had been more faithful to the book. Further than that, there are one or two moments here that have been borrowed from other films. One key line 'What does your heart tell you?' has been stolen direct from 'Star Wars', and Aragorn's final battle speech to his men is right out of 'Braveheart'. This sort of derivative nonsense need not have been included and it's presence lets the film down.Yet these are nevertheless very minor quibbles. They may keep 'Return of the King' from being a great movie, but they do not stop it from being a really good movie. The film lasts for over three and a quarter hours yet the time passes very quickly. The cinematography is once again excellent with some dizzyingly high mountain views and really good aerial shots. The camera-work makes Middle Earth a convincing and believable world and it is hard not to get absorbed in it.There are some fantastic scenes in the story. In a trap laid by Gollum, Sam and Frodo face Shelob, a terrifying giant spider that nearly makes short work of them. Then there is the siege on Minas Tirith, a beautiful city carved into a cliff. This sequence is in many ways an enlargement of the Helm's Deep battle in 'The Two Towers', but it is played brilliantly, with an exciting mix of drama, action, special effects and humour. The film thankfully keeps the Mount Doom finale faithful to the book, and is all the better because of it.Acting-wise, Viggo Mortensen is a little too relaxed as Aragorn. He's fine handling the dramatic scenes, but doesn't throw himself into the battles like he should. Because of this, his presence lacks edge. Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies are still good as Legolas and Gimli, but they don't get enough screen time to bring their friendship full circle.However, Ian MacKellen maintains a strong authoritative presence as Gandalf, while Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd are on fine form as Merry and Pippin, the latter even getting to sing at one point. John Noble is watch-ably loathsome as Denethor, the mad Steward of Mina Tirith who thinks nothing of burning his dying son alive in the midst of battle. Elijah Wood and Sean Astin remain a powerful central pair as Frodo and Sam, their affectionate companionship enduring abandonment and betrayal. Wood in particular pulls off the arc of his character, steadily building up over the previous films, with a subtle conviction that works very well.Yet once more Andy Serkis as Smeagol/Gollum just about steals the show. The opening flashback showing Smeagol's discovery of the ring and his slow, torturous corruption by it is haunting and gives a tragic depth to this character and shows his fate to be tragically linked to that of the ring and ironically leads to his redemption. People will be talking about and imitating Gollum long after the films themselves have faded from memory.Imperfect and perhaps lacking the edge that could have made it complete, 'Return of the King' nevertheless makes a rousing, enjoyable finale to this epic series.",Null,0,0,2 February 2004
Munich," Brilliant, brave and considerate film
","'Munich' is a brilliant piece of film-making. It takes the story of the 1972 Munich massacre (where Palestinian nationalists murdered 11 Israeli Olympic athletes) and uses to ask questions about terrorism and the use of violence as a legitimate response.Eric Bana plays Avner, who heads up a group of agents assembled by the Israeli government to track down and kill the terrorists responsible for the massacre. Avner, who has a wife and child, initially accomplishes his mission dispassionately. But his involvement with a pair of duplicitious information brokers (Matthieu Almaric and Michael Lonsdale), makes him question not only himself but the government he serves...Some brilliant acting by Bana and fellow Australian Geoffrey Rush, who plays his handler, highlights the humane issues raised in the script and their final confrontation, closed by a shot of the World Trade Centre towers, underlines this.Some fine ensemble work with the rest of the other actors, a strong screenplay and Spielberg's typically assured direction ensure this complex and intriguing tale is told without becoming completely incomprehensible.Still relevant today, especially after the Gaza bombings, 'Munich' is well worth viewing.",9,2,3,13 August 2009
The Truman Show," Chilling (spoilers below)
","Sporting performances of depth and subtlety and with a brilliant storyline, 'The Truman Show' is an exhilarating satire on media saturation in the modern world.  Whilst it is certainly flawed to a degree, the picture's plot and theme ring true all too often.  The effect is chilling.Jim Carrey plays Truman Burbank, a quiet, mild-mannered insurance worker in the small coastal town of Seahaven.  What he has been unaware of up until this point is that his entire life, from the day he was born, has been filmed as part of 24-hour TV show and that everyone he knows, even his wife and best friend, is an actor.  Seahaven itself is really a gigantic set built for the show.  But little by little, Truman begins to suspect the truth, culminating in a rebellion that shatters the very foundations of his existence.With shows like 'Big Brother' and 'Castaway' playing with the very idea of 'reality TV', not to mention media obsession with celebrity, 'The Truman Show' really hits home and acts as a very powerful cautionary tale about media greed, power and intrusion.  The film argues that surrendering to media power will mean we lose the ability to think and act for ourselves. 
The film ties this in with an attack on small-town life, seeing it as stuffy, restrictive and fake.  This theme is embodied in Seahaven's surroundings, which are beautiful but ultimately synthetic, and the people that inhabit them, actors who have become too used to routine and who repeat the same lines and moves day in and day out.  The analogy to the real thing is both subtle yet shocking.Gradually seeing through all this is Jim Carrey as Truman.  Unlike films like 'Ace Ventura' and 'Dumb and Dumber', this is a role where Carrey really gets to stretch his acting, as opposed to just his facial, muscles.  He pulls the role off very well, creating a convincing character who never loses his essential goodness even as the disturbing reality of his life eventually becomes clear to him.Another terrific performance is Ed Harris as the show's creator Christof, who controls Truman's every move from a room hidden in the set's moon. Christof appears to care alot about Truman, but he's really only concerned with ratings and money and this is what finally proves his undoing. 
Carrey and Harris are supported by an array of brilliant, well-cast supporting players who served very well by a witty and suspenseful script. 
The scenario isn't entirely perfect.  In fact, the whole setup appears so fragile it seems a wonder Truman didn't work the whole thing out earlier. But this is a very minor flaw.Well-directed and very well-acted, 'The Truman Show' stands as a frightening but thought-provoking parable on media power that is still very relevant in these chaotic times.",Null,0,0,16 February 2003
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Timeless classic (major spoilers)
","It is hard to believe that what is really a humble, conventional space opera has become nothing short of an international phenomenon.  Spawning two sequels, a trilogy of prequels, countless merchandising spin-offs and a rabid fan culture, 'Star Wars' has developed a mythology all its own. Yet, in spite of all the hype, looking back on 'Star Wars' makes it very easy to see why it has become so popular.To begin with, creator George Lucas' plot was ingeniously simple, incorporating character types and other elements from old Saturday matinee serials.  The result is an enjoyable storyline with easily identifiable characters.  Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), a farmboy from the desert planet of Tatooine, becomes embroiled in a rebellion against the evil Galactic Empire.  He teams up with Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness), the last of the Jedi, a near-extinct breed of guardian warriors; Han Solo (Harrison Ford), a reckless, apathetic mercenary; his hairy sidekick Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew); and finally C-3PO and R2-D2 (Anthony Daniels and Kenny Baker), a pair of bickering robots.  Together they must rescue Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) from the clutches of the evil Darth Vader (David Prowse, voiced by James Earl Jones).  Later, Luke must face up to his destiny as a Jedi as helps the Rebellion in their attack on the Death Star, a planet-destroying superweapon...The plot could not be simpler, or more enthralling, than that.  The characters are very easily identifiable (the earnest young hero, the wise old mentor, the cynical mercenary) and the embracing of story conventions contributes to the story, instead of detracting from it.  Much criticism has been made of script-writer Lucas' lack of flair with dialogue and to some extent this is true.It is to the credit of the actors who embellish their characters with a depth and a presence.  Hamill is possessed of a fine mix of enthusiasm, bravery and youthful naivety as Luke, and Harrison Ford is wry, smart and likeable as Solo.  His cynical, couldn't-care-less attitude to the chaos all around him stops the film from taking itself too seriously.  Carrie Fisher is also excellent as Princess Leia, giving her regal character a strength and a backbone.  Anthony Daniels and Kenny Baker are a lively and funny source of comic relief and here, unlike in the sequels, they actually contribute something to the plot.Of the villains, James Earl Jones lends an all-knowing powerful air to the voice of Darth Vader, who is given a strong physical presence by David Prowse.  Although Vader was to become the main villain of the series, here he's really more of a henchman.  Keeping him in line is Grand Moff Tarkin, played with ruthless authority by British actor Peter Cushing.
The special effects were revolutionary in 1977, giving the many fights and space battles a style and a sparkle that had never been seen before.  The lightsaber duel between Vader and Kenobi, and the final attack on the Death Star, are the main highlights here.In a way, 'Star Wars' has become the victim of its own success.  Rumour has it that Lucas will revise 'Star Wars' and its sequels yet again in the upcoming DVD releases, to ensure they dovetail exactly with the recently released prequels.  This does makes sense to do this, yet the danger is that Lucas will lose the spirit and verve that encapsulated the original film.
P.S To really enjoy 'Star Wars', make sure you see it in a large, packed cinema.  I guarantee this significantly increases the already high entertainment factor.",Null,1,1,26 March 2004
300," Gory, exciting but lacks tragic edge
","'300' is based on Frank Miller's comic book about the Spartans - 300 soldiers who made a brave stand against a marauding Persian army. I am familiar with neither the comic book nor the legend on which it's based, but I was watching an action movie and I judged it on that basis alone.On an action level, the film is a great success. I found the battle scenes gory and exciting as the Spartans use technique, teamwork and ingenuity (as well as sheer brute force) to tackle their adversaries. There was also a healthy dollop of wit in this scenes as well. I never tired of hearing Gerard Butler as the Spartan leader barking orders at his troops or offering up clever one-liners to friends and foes alike. The presence of trolls, man-wolves and deformed soldiers add fantasy overtones to the proceedings.It is in the character stakes I found the movie wanting, but not by too much. Due to a lack of depth in the characterisation, I found it difficult to really care for the soldiers as people. The relationship between Butler and his lieutenant, played by David Wenham, was particularly underdeveloped. More depth would have accentuated the Spartans' bravery, and made their inevitable fate more tragic and moving.However, the movie has a strong female character in Lena Headley's Queen Gorgo. While her husband is off to fight, she must stay behind and bargain with the Senate to give her man more backing. She generated a round of applause at my screening when she rammed a sword into the belly of the sleazy Senator who uses her. But again, there was a lack of emotional depth to the relationship between her and her husband. I never got the feeling they truly cared for each other, and in that the movie was robbed of further tragic dimension.Nevertheless, for stylish, harmless escapism, you can't really go wrong with '300' and in that the movie is well recommended.",7,0,5,26 March 2007
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Rich, dark adaption of the novel (major spoilers ahead)
","'Interview With The Vampire' is a noteworthy motion picture in today's times.  Much debate has been written about the translation of great literature to the screen and while the source novel itself is not really that old (it was written in 1976), it has gone on to be considered a classic in vampire lore.  It is then interesting to watch how Rice's text adapts itself (it was she who penned the screenplay) to the film medium.  The only major problem, as rich as this film is, it has slight inconsistencies that will baffle any viewer that has not read 'Interview' or its follow-ups.The film begins flying into downtown San Francisco through to the window of a quiet room, cut off from the busy world outside.  A vampire, Louis (Brad Pitt), recounts the story of his life to an intrigued journalist (Christian Slater).  A plantation owner living near New Orleans, Louis had recently lost his life and his daughter and had sunk into a self-destructive depression.  He meets Lestat (Tom Cruise), a vampire.  He's attracted by Louis' pained grieving and persuades Louis to let him turn him into a vampire.  Louis, however, regrets the decision and refuses to share Lestat's love for hunting and killing humans.  To remedy this, Lestat gives him a companion, an orphaned child Claudia (a very young Kirsten Dunst), to keep him company.  However, Claudia comes to resent Lestat for turning her, sparking off a tide of events that take Louis from New Orleans, to Paris and back...The story has many strong themes, and it does not take the traditional view of vampires as purely monsters (as depicted in 'Dracula' and countless rip-off Hollywood films) but sees them as individual personalities.  The very fact they will never die, and thus never change, is what truly cuts them off from humanity.  Therein they must live off the blood of those who do change, in order to survive.  This is the very fate that most deeply affects Claudia, condemned to spend her eternal life in the body of a child. Louis resists his vampiric urges and ponders, in his own self-pitying way, the meaning of eternal life.  Lestat, on the other hand, has no time for that and enjoys indulging his bloodthirsty cravings.  If you're going to live forever,  you may as well enjoy it.This bleeds into other themes too.  When Louis and Claudia discover the Parisian Theatre of the Vampires, and Armand (Antonio Banderas), Louis discovers that there vampires are mutually inable to discern their history. In trying to do so, however, they end up decadent and marooned in the past. To count this, Armand advises disregarding the past altogether and embracing the changes of the future.  He says to secure Louis' affections, and Louis very nearly takes him on. There are inconsistencies.  You would need to have read 'The Vampire Lestat' to understand how Lestat has powers slightly different from other vampires, thus enabling him to survive Claudia and Louis' attempts to kill him, not to mention his ability to fly at will.  This is not explained sufficiently in the movie.  Yet these are minor nitpickings, for the main semblance of the story is intact and the film is all the better for it.Brad Pitt makes for a thoughtful, contemplative yet at the same time passionate Louis.  It is very easy to sympathise with him.  Tom Cruise (initially derided by author Anne Rice) attacks the part of Lestat with a dark, charismatic relish.  Kirsten Dunst is a strong, tragic presence as the doomed Claudia.  Antonio Banderas is fine as Armand, even if he does not generate the homoerotic tension necessary to understand his attraction to Louis.  Stephen Rea is quite happy to go clownishly over-the-top as the sadistic vampire actor Santiago. The film is very well shot, with some wonderfully sweeping cinematography from Philippe Rousselot.  This is accompanied by Eliot Goldenthal's eerie music score, which is seamlessly weaved in with classical music from Beethoven, Handel and even Mick Jagger.  The direction is good, but anyone expecting a scare-fest will be disappointed.  The film is not overtly frightening, but the more physical scenes, with the vampires and their victims, are appropriately bloody and erotic.A rich, dark and exquisite picture.  Well recommended.",Null,1,3,1 May 2004
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Bleak and atmospheric sequel (spoilers)
","Sandwiched between the exceptional 'Star Wars' and the comparatively so-so 'Return of the Jedi', 'The Empire Strikes Back' is widely considered to be the best of the original 'Star Wars' trilogy.  The film has it's one or two flaws, but it does develop the story and characters in surprisingly dark ways.  This has to be the bleakest and most nihilistic 'Star Wars' film so far.Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and his rag-tag group of rebels are now on the run from the Empire, hiding out in the icy planet of Hoth.  After they are routed by Imperial forces, the group split.  Luke heads off to swamp planet Degobah to seek out Jedi Master Yoda (Frank Oz), who will instruct him further in the ways of the Force.  Meanwhile aboard the Millenium Falcon, his friends Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) are hunted relentlessly hunted down by Darth Vader (David Prowse, voiced by James Earl Jones), intent on using them to locate Skywalker...The scriptwork and acting hits a peak in this film. Darth Vader comes into his own here.  Given a much more commanding role, and willfully choking to death incompetent underlings, he is more of a threatening and sinister presence.  And yet you begin to see hints of the inner conflict behind the steely black mask, culminating in his now infamous revelation to Luke at the end of the film.Further developed here are Han and Leia, as the story gives them a romantic attraction.  Initially it feels unlikely, a hardened but nevertheless proper Leia falling for a rogue like Solo but Fisher and Ford work well to make the romance touching and believable without going over the top.Mark Hamill is on fine form as Luke Skywalker.  The young Jedi-to-be is really put through the wringer here, and Hamill carries it off well. However the droids C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) and R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) have their dramatic importance (but not their screen time) seriously reduced, and as a result become more of a distraction than an amusement.Of the new characters, Billy Dee Williams is convincingly ambiguous as Lando, an old friend of Solo whose motives are initially suspect.  But best of all is Frank Oz as the benevolent Yoda, his gentle voice and memorably unique use of language conveying power and sage wisdom.Some great settings here.  There is the above-mentioned Hoth and Degobah, but also Cloud City, whose eerie inner chambers and corridors (combined with John William's haunting score) set the scene for the finale. Great set-pieces include a chase through an asteroid belt, and Luke and Vader's final duel.'The Empire Strikes Back' is a worthy sequel to 'Star Wars', as well as a first-rate science fiction film in its own right.",Null,0,1,27 March 2004
Braveheart," Simplistic but superlative action film (spoilers)
","Those who lambast Mel Gibson for his supposedly anti-Jewish sentiments in his recent production 'The Passion of the Christ' would do well to remember his anti-English, and indeed anti-gay, portrayals in this otherwise superlative action film.  Gibson's epic, bloody romance was never meant to be a factual account of Scottish legend William Wallace, but has stimulated more interest in the real thing than a mere documentary ever could.Set in Britain in the 13th Century the plot, based largely on myth about the Scottish renegade, sees a young William Wallace (James Robinson) witness the brutal murder of his father (Sean Lawlor) at the hands of English occupiers. He is taken under the wing of his wise Uncle Argyle (Brian Cox) and grows up under his guardianship.  Wallace (now played by Mel Gibson) returns home an educated man, falls in love with a beautiful local girl Murron (Catherine MacCormack) and marries her.  However, when English soldiers rape and murder his wife, Wallace mounts a rebellion, bringing him into conflict with both the English King Edward Longshanks (Patrick MacGoohan) and duplicitious Scottish nobles, led by Robert the Bruce (Angus MacFayden)...The film makes no effort whatsoever in regards to historical accuracy, and the the characters come off (with variable success) as simplistic stereotypes.  There is nothing wrong with most of this, but some stereotypes could have been avoided, in particular the portrayal of King Edward's son as a snivelling homosexual fop.  By necessity the English are the villains, with the Scots either passionate warriors or double-dealing nobles. Whilst the anti-English sentiment is a touch overdone (a character exclaims 'Excellent!' when he's told he'll get to kill the English), it doesn't seriously harm the film.Gibson has thankfully not Americanised his tale by asking American actors to assume fake Scottish brogues.  With the exception of Gibson himself, almost everyone's accent here is natural and the film is better for it.  Gibson delivers his all as Wallace, managing a passable Scottish accent.  His Wallace is a Scottish Mad Max, only savvier, more sentimental and with a powerful patriotic streak.  The character, though, lacks the ambiguity to make him a realistic personality.  The film sees nothing questionable in Wallace invading England, effectively lowering himself to the level of his former oppressors.As for the supporting players, Patrick MacGoohan quietly evinces menace as the ruthless King, and Sophie Marceau makes the most of her limited role as the Princess of Wales.  Angus McFayden gives a sympathetic portrayal of a torn Robert the Bruce, and Brendan Gleeson and David O'Hara provide solid backup as Wallace's trustiest allies.The battle scenes in the film are frenetically staged, with lots of quick editing plus copious amounts of blood and gore.  They are well put together, but the endless slicing, dicing and skewering becomes repetitive after a while.  Woven into the tale is a gentle Celtic score by James Horner.Whilst it has stirred interest in Scottish interest and heritage (including the life of the real William Wallace), taken on its own terms, 'Braveheart' is an enjoyable action film and should not be taken any more seriously than that.",Null,32,61,26 April 2004
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Very human finale to the Indiana Jones trilogy (spoilers)
","Despite the many rumours of a fourth movie, 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade' remains the conclusion to the Indiana Jones series.  After complaints about the violence in the last film, as well as the abundance of racial stereotypes, both elements have been toned down for 'Last Crusade'. In fact there is a considerably more human and spiritual emphasis in 'Last Crusade' than in its predecessors.  This is a story of betrayal, religious faith and the mending of a broken relationship between father and son.After an opening prologue which sees a young Indiana Jones (the late River Phoenix) steal an important artefact from the hands of looters, and acquire his fedora and skill with the whip in the process, the action moves forward to 1939, where Jones (Harrison Ford) is asked by antique collector Donovan (Julian Glover) to find his father Henry Jones(Sean Connery), who went missing helping Donovan find the Holy Grail.On rescuing his father, Jones learns that Donovan is really a Nazi turncoat. Making a daring escape, Jones with the help of his father, museum curator Brody (Denholm Elliot) and his old friend Sallah (John Rhys-Davies) races to find the Grail before Donovan and the Nazis get their hands on it...The story by George Lucas and Menno Meyjes lifts its plot virtually straight from 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', with Indy racing against faceless German soldiers to retrieve a precious artefact with mystical powers.  In large part because of this, 'Last Crusade' does not possess the freshness or ingenuity of 'Raiders' and the story itself has one or two flaws of its own. The elaborate deception the Nazis use to lure Jones into the Grail hunt never really holds water and too often it is never explained how Jones, stuck in the middle of nowhere after a chase or fight, manages to get himself to wherever he's meant to be for the next scene.However, there is a great deal more humanity than the two predecessors and it is from this element that the movie benefits.  The hunt for the Grail is used as a test of both faith and intellectual ingenuity.  This is especially true with in the film's finale, which sees Jones relying on both these traits to survive and win through.  Very intentionally, there is a lack of sexual chemistry here which is substituted by the relationship between Indy and his father.  The quest for the Grail, which so obsessed Henry Jones he cut himself off from his son thus splitting them apart, is what brings them together as the quest nears its end.  As the film progresses, they repair their broken relationship in a convincing and touching manner.This is helped by some splendid acting from Ford and Connery, who bring the relationship to life.  Ford has settled in now as a more mature but still adventurous Indiana Jones, and Connery brings some feisty humour into the role of his bookish dad.  They are well supported by Julian Glover and Michael Byrne (playing head Nazi Vogel) as the chief villains, along with Alison Doody as an attractive researcher who isn't all she appears to be. John Rhys-Davies and Denholm Elliot both return from 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' and their increased screen-time here is welcome.There is plenty of action in Last Crusade, all of it accentuated by the themes and music of the brilliant John Williams.  The best sequences include a fight aboard a boat in the middle of a stormy ocean, and a great horse/tank sequence in the desert.Even if they do not make a fourth film, we still have this: an imperfect but still very fitting end to an enjoyable action/adventure series.",Null,0,0,2 June 2004
Back to the Future," Clever, and inventive time travel comedy (spoilers)
","Directed by acclaimed Oscar winner Robert Zemeckis, and with a script by him and Bob Gale, 'Back to the Future' is one of the better, if not the best, time-travel tale committed to film.  The key to this film's success is that it functions not so much as science fiction, but as simple human drama with an eccentric twist.It's Hill Valley 1985, and Marty McFly (Michael J.Fox) is a carefree but insecure teenager with a beautiful girlfriend, a family of bullied losers, and a sole friend in mad scientist Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd).  The good Doc has just invented a time-travelling car, and it is in this vehicle that Marty ends up in 1955, at the doorstep of his parents when they were just teenaged kids.  Marty must secure the Doc's help to get back to the future, in the meantime ensuring his birth by uniting his nerdish father (Crispin Glover) with his outrageously flirty mother (Lea Thompson)...The science in the story is conveniently glossed over, and the idea of time travel is really no more than a gimmick to explore a childhood curiosity of what our parents were like as children.  The script uses this to point out some humorous aspects of parental and romantic relationships.  This is especially true in the well-handled Oedipal twist where Marty's mother falls in love with him.  The parent roles are reversed when Marty chastises his mum for typically teenage behaviour whereupon he's told: 'Marty, you're beginning to sound just like my mother'.  There are plenty of other small, knowing jokes and plot twists in the story (there's a good onrunning gag about the town mayor). The setting of the fictitious Hill Valley is well recreated for both time periods, although the effect (particularly with the 1950's section) is one more of rose-tinted nostalgia than balanced realism.  The action is well-paced by Robert Zemeckis, allowing the plot and the comedy to develop at ease.The cast boasts a gallery of well-played, memorable characters.  Fox is a hit as the teenage everyman Marty, and Lloyd is on fine eccentric form as the scientist Doc.  Crispin Glover is excellent as Marty's dad, brilliantly conveying the transformation from bumbling idiot to confident, assertive adult. Lea Thompson gets it just right in all respects as Marty's mother, playing it subtley but emotively.  They are well-supported by Thomas F.Wilson as the bullying Biff Tannen, and James Tolkan as the school disciplinarian Mr Strickland.The film builds to an exciting, suspenseful finale and ends with an opening for not one but two sequels to this superb original.",Null,0,1,18 August 2004
Goodfellas," Terrific gangster tale
","'Goodfellas' is another gangster movie featuring Italian-American mobsters and possesses several parallels with 'The Godfather' in the way it depicts mob life. 'Goodfellas' is a more realistic movie that de-mythologises gangster life, showing it to be dangerous and highly unpredictable, drenched in blood and ambition. There is not even the faintest whiff of romanticism that you might find in 'The Godfather'.The story follows Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) and his rise in late 60s and 70s New York to become a 'made man' among the mob. Along the way he finds himself working for Tommy Cicero (Paul Sorvino), the local mob boss, and alongside characters such as Jimmy Conway (Robert DeNiro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci).Nearly every recognisable gangster character actor in the US makes an appearance in this picture, (excluding Al Pacino and Marlon Brando). All the actors in this picture acquit themselves admirably. I can't say Liotta is in the same acting league as DeNiro or Pesci, whom he's frequently seen alongside. He just lacks the charisma to give the movie a strong enough centre. He is a good actor, but much of the time his performance seems hollow compared to the others.Martin Scorcese directs in fine style, including several daring long shots that follow Henry and his friends in and about their business. Script and storyline are also very good, and spring one or two surprises on the audience.I'm not as fond of this as I am of 'The Godfather' but nevertheless it is a fine picture.",8,0,1,22 June 2007
