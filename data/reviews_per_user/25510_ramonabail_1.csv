The Lobster," Worst movie ever!
","This movie is not worth watching! Don't waste your time with it! It has a very weird story, it is very very awkward. It is similar to the French Amelie movie. So if you don't like the Amelie movie, don't watch this one! I did not like it! I had to force myself to watch it until the end! I can't believe it was nominated for an Oscar!",1,2,4,7 August 2017
