The Sound of Music," Pulls you in with its irrepressible optimism
","I've never been a musicals kind of guy. I thought The Rocky Horror Picture Show was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I've avoided most others like the plague.The three hour runtime of this movie always put me off, but I finally saw it with my girlfriend a few weeks ago and was astonished at how likable the film was.The fact that it was good wasn't a shocker since it's an all time classic that won half a dozen Oscars, but the fact that it could pull me in amazed me.The story is compelling because of Julie Andrews' performance. She pulls you into her plight, which seems a bit one dimensional at the start but fills up with more emotional depth as the story presses on and becomes more wrapped up in everyone's lives.It discusses formerly taboo subjects like the Nazi occupation of Austria and what it felt like to be an appeaser versus a renegade in a time where people's true patriotism was tested.I couldn't think of this movie being more fulfilling and well-done. See it. It's a classic.",10,3,10,29 March 2007
Enchanted," Classic storytelling blended perfectly with modern reality
","I'm not in this movie's target demographic. I'm a guy aged 24-30. Yet the preview sucked me in, and I'm glad I did. Why? It's a movie that tells us a little about ourselves, and makes fun of how we distinguish fantasy from reality and why we hold onto our dreams.We all want the fairy tale to come true, but as we get older, we learn that reality is much less beautiful than the idealized world of Disney fantasy. This movie plays to that duality expertly, examining what we believe, asking us why, and making us laugh along the way.Giselle the would-be princess will win you over with her idealist naiveté. She steals scenes with her energetic personality, and makes you wish you believed how she does. Her musical scene while cleaning house will have you laughing along as fantasy and reality clash in a brilliant mockery.Prince Edward will have you rooting for the wrong guy because he's just so likable. He's played by James Marsden, aka Scott from the X-Men (who was a dick), which really showcases his versatility. He can sing, dance, and play naive romantic to a T.Patrick Dempsey once again removes himself from the limelight with a too low-key performance, but he's the straight guy that grounds the film, so that's the point. He still changes as Giselle's giddy make believe world intrudes on his life and the way he thinks, so you get to feel for him as if he were you.By the end of the film you'll find yourself wondering if you still believe in the fairy tale style romance, or if you're a modern realist. The best part is, this movie gives you that choice.Everybody comes out a winner from this film, including the audience. It's a perfect date movie, unless you don't like who you're dating, in which case it'll be really awkward, because this movie is unrelentingly romantic.",10,16,19,26 November 2007
Casino Royale," Bond goes gritty and realistic, and works wonders
","My girlfriend is a Bond freak. She owns every DVD, and almost every VHS. She has three copies of some of them. Thusly, I've seen all of them, from the first to the last.Having been given the benefit of understanding the progression of the films to the most recent, I was pleasantly surprised when I saw Casino Royale.Gone were the goofy gimmicks of invisible cars and x ray sunglasses, and gone were the unrealistic, corny plots.This Bond got real in a big way, and revitalized the franchise.As everyone knows, the films rest heavily on the performance of the title role, and Daniel Craig was definitely a risk. He's blond, he's got blue eyes, and he definitely hasn't played this role before.He also hit the ball out of the park with his performance. Gritty, raw, but with an emotional depth that was lacking in Timothy Dalton's far-too-serious Bond, Craig split the emotional double role right down the middle, making his character more human in the process.That doesn't mean he can't be tough. His fight scenes and chases had a brutal reality that was totally absent from perhaps the last six Bond films, which had relied on increasingly stylized fighting to wow the audience with visual flair that defied reality.Craig and the film crew brought the brutal realism back with a vengeance. You felt the informant's head crashing through the porcelain of the sink. You raced into the room with Bond as he chased the bad guy.He brought you into the scene with him.My complaints lie in the latter parts of the film. I consider this film to be essentially two in one. I can't tell you what that is, or I'd spoil it, but considering this monster's record length, you can figure there's a lot of plot in there. It could have been split in two, had 20 minutes added to each end, and been two very successful films.When it does transition over is the problem. All too quickly does it race into the romantic aspects, only to be tossed into act two with breakneck speed. I didn't expect this, and was wondering why the movie kept going.Not that every moment wasn't really necessary. There's no filler material here, but it's so high energy the whole way through that it's exhaustive just to watch. But it's worth it. See it and understand. Bond is back, and Craig has made the role his own.",9,0,3,28 March 2007
Trainspotting," Brilliantly witty, oddly funny tale of heroin addiction's dark side
","When I was still in high school, this came out in the theater, and I remember desperately wanting to see it. My mom saw it, told me it was 'too depressing' and so I didn't.A few years later, I found a good reason to slap my mom when I remembered the film and rented it on a whim.This is comedy and drama as beautifully blended as I've ever seen on film.I was shocked at how brilliantly this movie flowed from the first moment of it. The opening monologue voiced over a foot chase scene was unforgettable, as Mark Renton rifled off in meth-juiced prose his reason for becoming a drug addict - his revulsion for choosing life as others saw fit, ending in a characteristically dry punchline to echo his whimsical understanding of his otherwise dour seeming situation.The movie immediately plunges you into the world of the druggie, crawling along the floor of a heroin house as people pass out all around. You get to meet some of Renton's friends - all deep characters in their own rights.One of this movie's biggest strengths is the depth of the characters from their very introduction. You get to know them all as if they were your own friends, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, played upon expertly by Irvine Welsh's scripting throughout the film.It balances brilliantly the duality between straight people, drug addicts, and alcoholics with a holier than thou attitude toward illegal addicts, touching in depth upon the stresses of a druggie lifestyle, while never falling too far away from the whimsical nature of the film to make a joke out of place.If you've ever had an angry moment, you'll love Francis Begbie. His raw, inappropriate rage is comical because you get to see it from the outside.If you've ever had a moment of doubt, you'll love Mark Renton. He's the perennial introspective psychologist, keenly aware of his condition, struggling with whether he wants his lifestyle, always laughingly dry about it.If you've ever had a 'bad' friend, you'll love Sick Boy. He's pushy, disloyal, always right, always wrong, but you can't get away from him.If you've ever had a naive friend, you'll love Spud. His weakness makes him ever funnier as the movie goes on, particularly in the speed addled job interview scene, which is a comedic gem.This movie pushes you to new places, and you'll beg to keep going. It's raw, witty, and undeniably compelling. Don't even bother renting it. Buy it.",10,0,0,28 March 2007
300," A great idea wrought shamefully on the silver screen
","I love epic style movies. I loved Gladiator, Clash of the Titans (as a kid) and any movie that makes history come alive. I love sports movies that have to do with comebacks, overcoming tough odds, and the like. I also have a thing for violence.Those three factors alone made me think 300 would be one of my favorite movies. Little did I know it was possible to make an epic historical movie about fighting impossible odds with extreme violence that I would hate.Well done, Warner Brothers.I'll make this easy for people who want a list pros and cons, starting with the latter because it outnumbers its more optimistic forbear so heavily: Cons: 1) The dialog is agonizingly juvenile and cliché. During a dramatic entering into the fray, the leader of the Spartans' reinforcements shouts 'Lets show the Spartans what we can do!' Lines in perfect moments to drum up the drama of a scene fall flat like that over and over again until you're basically expecting it by halfway through. After the queen's impassioned speech to the senate, I found myself thinking 'you've gotta be sh!^^ing me.' It resonated with all the power of a fifth grader reading a George W. Bush speech off a blurry cue card. I understand that the five lines in the movie (the ones not stolen from an odd combination of recent movies and elementary school history assignments) were reported to have been spoken at the battle itself. If the entire rest of the movie weren't just as awkward and simplistic, they may have worked. 2) Points of the plot that didn't even require mention were either mentioned explicitly or repeated ad nausea. The narrator seemed very interested in reminding you that there were only 300 Spartans throughout the film. It was also made well known that the Spartans wouldn't surrender and would keep fighting, over and over again. It was as if the screenwriter were drunk and forgot he'd mentioned those points, and didn't bother to check the script before taking it to press.3) Casting made some huge mistakes. Dilios, played by a then 40 year old David Wenham, had the faked voice of a grizzled chain smoker twice his age, seemingly to make him sound more imposing than he looked and to correspond with the narrator's voice after the fact. Considering that everybody else on the battlefield looked and sounded correct for the part, the fourth-billed actor in the film came off like Burgess Meredith with ripped abs. Needless to say, this was confusing and unnerving.4) The sex scene when the king and queen say their intimate 'goodbye, I may never see you again' should have lasted about ten seconds. Instead it was stretched to more than a minute of near pornographic detail, including the king lovingly banging his wife doggy style. I don't know what message that was trying to convey, but it was pretty out of place. For some viewers that may be seen as a plus, but my sexually adventurous girlfriend and I looked at each other and mouthed 'WTF?' 5) Most of the fight scenes were so poorly explained beforehand that they seemed only to extend the runtime of the movie. I understand that there were supposedly three days of fighting, which corresponds with the alleged true story of the battle, but the plot glossed over this, instead just blindly flashing between scenes.6) The 'effects' were pathetic facsimiles of those from real movies. Every scene was filmed in a green screen sound stage. No scene had more than 20 real actors in it, when there appeared to be tens of thousands. Every 'giant' in the movie was a CGI modified regular sized person. This was painfully obvious when the seemingly 8' tall King Xerxes puts his hand on Leonidus' shoulder and it just kind of floats there.7) Plot elements were either rushed or non-existent. Without any real reason the Spartans are already going off to war within the first ten minutes of the movie. The deepest a character gets is the five seconds of doubt the king has before his freaky session with the queen, or when one character cries after his son gets decapitated. Everybody else is one dimensional. Come movie's end, a full two hour investment later you still don't give a damn about any of them.8) The music throughout the film was at times either inappropriate or ripped straight out of a U.S. Army commercial.There's too much else to criticize about the film so I'll mention the positives.Pros: 1) Lots of random hot naked chicks.2) The fighting itself was pretty cool, and they attempted to stylize this with rapidly changing camera speeds, which you may or may not like. (I didn't).3) Some cool fake CGI mythical creatures.4) Finally a hunchback gets a co-star nod in an action film.5) Gerard Butler's King Leonidas is a decently strong character.6) Abs galore.I gave it a 3 out of 10 merely because it was 'faithful to the book', which apparently should never have been adapted to film. I don't really understand the draw of mature adults reading comic books, which they've defensively re-dubbed 'graphic novels', but I guess if you do, you might like this movie despite it being so poorly rendered. I liked the X-Men series a lot, and look forward to the fourth one, but this movie sucked.",3,30,53,27 March 2007
