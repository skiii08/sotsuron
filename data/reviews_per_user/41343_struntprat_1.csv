3:10 to Yuma," It leaves you with mixed emotions
","Rest assured, Hollywood has yet to find out how to make a credible western-remake. This is probably as good as it gets, and according to the generous rating here, many seems to accept all the short-comings of this movie. That's probably the best way to enjoy this movie. It has all the elements of a cool western; a bad guy with a gang, a hero with a nice family, a lot of shooting and a lot of dead people. Well, the last thing we won't care much about anyway because the one one who dies we do not know or don't like anyway. It's quite typical for a western, I'm sad to say. The atmosphere is right on the spot. It's wild west all right, where the boots always are dirty and the men mostly are the same. There is no real shortcoming of suspense, so you won't be disappointed of that either. However, it won't go down to history as a classic, of obvious reasons. A great movie must have a credible ending. This has not. Other things that might annoy, is the casting. I would rather have seen the former serial killer (American Psycho) Christian Bale as the outlaw, and former hero (Gladiator) Russell Crowe as the rancher. However, that's an opinion that you might not share. But, you will get annoyed of how easy money can persuade anyone to take a mans life, and some moments you seriously will question how poorly people can shoot. Enough said without spoilers, you will enjoy two fine actors and you will have a good time watching this. Just don't think too much about the shortcomings and you will do fine. For me, it left me with mixed emotions. It's like being a small boy, and mama promise you candy. You expect a lot of fine chocolate, but all you get is toffee. Well, it's still candy, you know.",5,0,5,6 April 2008
