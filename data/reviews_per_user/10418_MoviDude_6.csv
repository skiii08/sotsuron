The Blair Witch Project," Very creepy
","I've seen BWP twice, and let me tell you, it is much, much creepier the second time around. What can I say that hasn't been already said? It's a very well-made film, very realistic, great performances(especially Heather Donahue; you can't even tell that she's acting, her performance is so realistic.). My heart was beating during the final five minutes. Wow! What an ending! My hat is off to all who contributed to the making of this film.",8,1,1,7 August 1999
Fight Club," Brilliant, one of the years best films
","Notice I didn't say 'one of the years best movies.' This isn't a Brad Pitt movie, this is a brilliant piece of work. It isn't for everyone(there were several walk outs at a recent showing I attended) and that can be attributed to the grisly violence that is portrayed. Yes, it is bloody and yes, it is graphic. But, I don't think that is the point that the film is trying to get across. The first hour is rampant with rich, satirical humor, and I admit that I did laugh. By the last half, the tone had shifted to be very, very dark. Edward Norton, I think, is one of the best actors of the 90s--he becomes his characters, shows their weaknesses, etc. Here, he is great as the Narrator. [...]. Brad Pitt, who I don't like much as an actor, finally gives a performance worthy of calling him a thespian. His Tyler Durden is flamboyant, mysterious, self-serving, and, as we learn, very dangerous and vital to the plot. Helena Bonham Carter is fantastic in a very different role--this is far from her British period-piece roles. The film is often brutal in how it is portrayed. One factor that I was disturbed by was the message of the film, which dealt with anarchy and nihilism and that violence is an outlet for frustration. Fight Club is a '90s masterpiece and deserves to join Eyes Wide Shut, The Sixth Sense, Tarzan, October Sky, The Blair Witch Project, and American Beauty as one of the years best films. 4 out of 4 stars.",9,0,1,16 October 1999
For Love of the Game," Sluggish, like a wet sponge
","This movie stunk. There. I said it. I'm not going to give in to peer pressure and say, 'Oh, this was a well-acted wonderful movie that is one of the best of all time and features great performances from Kelly Preston and Kevin Costner.' No. Maybe what would've saved this garbage is if Kevin's full-frontal scene would have been left in. No, even then it would've stunk. The acting was atrocious by the two leads--Preston only gets recognition because she's married to John Revolta and Costner hasn't been in a good film since JFK. There were some awful bits of dialogue('I'll remember you the most, Scarecrow.')and incredibly overdone soppy scenes. I thought I would need an insulin shot just to remedy all the sweet sappiness and sugar that I had just been injected with. It was awful. Scenes were badly staged from left to right. I went to the bathroom, figuring I wouldn't miss much, and I was right. I came back, and most everybody was slumped in their seats, nearly asleep. Okay, okay, I'm not a coldhearted individual here; I like a good romance just as much as anybody, but this was ridiculous. Each time the two leads would come close to kissing, Costner would stiffen up and remain wooden for the rest of the scene. It was excruciatingly awkward. Some good things(and there are a few): The supporting cast is good--I've always thought that Jena Malone is one of the most talented young actresses out there, and she acquits herself nicely. John C. Reilly has some good lines as Billy Chapel's buddy. Sometimes, the cinematography/photography was pretty good. But, for the rest? It stunk. Miss this one at all costs.One star out of four.",2,0,2,18 September 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," Interesting, yet not a masterpiece
","While I really liked Kubrick's final film, it left me puzzled and disoriented at times. I can't call it his masterpiece, to be honest with you, but I still feel that it is one of the best films of the year. In a weak year for quality films, the best so far have been October Sky, Tarzan, Blair Witch Project, and now Eyes Wide Shut.",9,0,0,7 August 1999
The Green Mile," Wonderful, sentimental entertainment
","I saw The Green Mile today: it was a wonderfully made film, with superb performances from the cast; I especially liked Michael Clark Duncan(deserves an Oscar nom, definitely), David Morse and Doug Hutchison as the cowardly, evil Percy. I really liked Frank Darabont's previous effort The Shawshank Redemption; he and Stephen King tales go together. Here, he has ably helmed an emotionally spiritual film, full of wonder and sadness. The showing I was at, I heard many people sniffling, especially during the end scenes; I admit that there was a lump in my throat by the end, it was that involving. It certainly is excellent, and one of the years best, but there are still plenty of films that I feel are better (American Beauty comes to mind) but it is still a great moviegoing experience.",9,0,0,18 December 1999
The Sixth Sense," One of the years best, if not the best.
","I went to see the Sixth Sense with little knowledge except that it had gotten some very good word-of-mouth reactions. I hadn't even heard of it until the day it opened: I had never seen an ad or preview for it at all. Once I left the theater, my first reaction was: Wow! Writer/Director M. Night Shyamalan can be credited for a thoughtful script that deals intelligently with life and death. The performances are uniformly superb. Bruce Willis has never been regarded as much of an actor, but here he gives a nice understated performance that gives the film its weight. Toni Collette is very good as Cole's mom, frustrated over her inability to understand what her son is going through. Olivia Williams is wasted in a role that doesn't give her much to do. Donnie Wahlberg is great in his two minutes as a clinically depressed patient. Still, the film wouldn't work without the brilliant performance of little Haley Joel Osment, who gives one of the best performances of the year and perhaps one of the best child performances ever. This kid is great! He projects a great sorrow and pain in his role, and acts better than most seasoned actors. I hope that come the end of the year, he will have gotten a deserved Oscar nod. The years best so far(that will likely change, but for now, this is the one to see.)Four out of four stars",9,0,0,28 August 1999
