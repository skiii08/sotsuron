It," A near-perfect reboot horror! // Instagram: moviesmaniax
","Okay, since I'm now swifting It Comes At Night to my best thriller of the year category, this near-perfect reboot of Stephen King's IT is now THE best horror film this year (so far) and is easily one of the best clown horror films ever made. IT packs plenty of genuine scares as well as jumpy ones, all of which are presented way more frequent than most big studio horror films and making its pacing flow well with constant scares and thrills to keep the audience entertained and spooked throughout the film. The use of practical effects here are also deliciously creepy and gleefully disturbing to look at along with the freaky performance from Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd as Pennywise just even increases the insanity and horrifying level of this re-imagining version of the character without entirely replicating what has already been done (still, this version of Pennywise somehow reminds me of Johnny Depp's Mad Hater on cocaine at some point). Not only does this film have all the horrors to offer but other elements in the film here are also crafted so well like The Losers' Club. The Losers' Club here are perfectly cast, acted, and developed, making us care about their fates and relationships and therefore, be able to hook us to the screen from start to finish with their funny, energetic, and heartbreaking performances. Overall, besides its genuinely frequent scares, applaudingly creepy practical effects, and performances, IT not only proves to be a near-perfect remake but also strongly adapts what already has been done and creates a whole new insanity level of horror on top of that, as well as keeping the same heartbreaking drama core of the original through its exceptional cast into finally becoming this year's best horror film.(A)",10,10,22,8 September 2017
The Babadook," Definitely one of the BEST films of this year and probably the finest psychological horror film ever made // instagram: moviesmaniax
","Not many films that I went in with high expectation and came out with the same feeling as I was expecting. From its skillful directing to brilliant script along with creepy sound effects and gleefully insane performance, this film succeeds greatly and effectively on these elements. Instead of cheap SCARES and GORES, this film smartly uses its atmosphere, story, and performance from both the mother and son lead in boosting into an effective scare that really haunts you in its truthful message. However, this is a great FUN for those who enjoy more of a psychological type of horror film over those who prefer gores and cheap scares but overall, this is such a masterfully crafted and suspenseful horror film that you have to see it for yourself to believe in how perfect everything comes together as a whole movie. Definitely one of the BEST films of this year and probably the finest psychological horror film ever made. >>A<<",10,16,36,13 October 2014
Us," Lupita Nyong'o deserves an Oscar // more REVIEWS on instagram @moviesmaniax
","First off, Lupita Nyong'o probably delivers the best performance I have ever seen in any horror movie EVER. Her performance is just so genuinely creepy and deeply unsettling, especially those Oscar moments with her other self that unfortunately seems to overshadow the inferior nature of the film itself. (Also shout out to Elisabeth Moss for her intriguing performance too). But, 'Best Horror Movie of All Time'? Hell no. It seems to be clear now that Jordan Peele doesn't seem to like showing the gores in his movie, which in this one, is quite a let down, because there are lots and lots of opportunities to go hard on that R-rating, which in my honest opinion, would make this a much more horrific and terrifying experience to watch as a whole. The film also has some humorous, some scary moments, and decent twist, yet nothing over-the-top that would give you nightmares or shock you in any way, which again, is quite a let down. Instead, Us drives you toward that thrills on the 'why' rather than the 'how', triggering your curiosity while delivering a bloody fun ride along the way. Nonetheless, Us is a thoughtful, well-crafted, funny, thrilling, and inventive horror film fueled by Oscar worthy performance from Lupita Nyong'o, with that alone, is more than enough to highly recommend this movie for.",8,0,3,22 March 2019
It Follows," Will surely scare the daylight out of you // instagram: moviesmaniax
","If The Sixth Sense scared the sh*t out of you when going to toilet at night, or Paranormal Activity made you afraid to stay at home alone, It Follows will definitely creep you out when walking back alone at night. After I saw this film, I would definitely run my ass off if I see anyone walking slowly behind me late at night. This film is a truly modern classic with its original and brilliant concept, all of which is put together nicely with its expertly directing and thought-provoking scares. The SCARES here are effective throughout thanks largely to its excellent soundtrack and intense sound effects that even though you can tell something is coming from its increasing volume of the music, but it will still effectively shock and gives you the chill down your spines when it happens. There are not many GORY scenes here but once it happens, it's definitely a terrifying one to look at. Overall, It Follows is not only the scariest film since The Conjuring but also one of the best ones worth watching before you die for its directing, concept, performance, music, etc, all of which comes together and works perfectly. It may have some funny moments along the way but once the scare comes, it's just expertly done and this film will surely scare the daylight out of you.>>A-<<",9,121,238,18 March 2015
A Quiet Place," Easily the best horror of the year so far // MORE REVIEWS on instagram: moviesmaniax
","A well-deserved 97% Certified Fresh on Rottentomatoes. A Quiet Place starts off with a promising concept that basically if you make a sound, these creatures would come out and eventually slice you in half. This allows a fresh take on the film's storytelling through mostly silent sequences that once something does make a sound, it will effectively make you jump and make your heart beats like a running horse as you unexpectedly anticipate what's about to happen next. Once the film hooks you with this gimmick, the thrills only go uphill from there where it smartly builds up the stakes of this family, making it even higher and thus lowering their chances of surviving, thus leaving the viewers a more terrifying and breathless experience as the story progresses. Another selling point of this film are these grotesque, alien-looking creatures that look deliciously creepy and mesmerizingly frightening as well as the strong performances and well-constructed characters that you will actually end up liking and caring for their fates. Overall, not only does this film have a promising concept but also with its breathlessly terrifying moments along with brilliantly constructed characters and plot, the execution is just beyond and exceptionally horrifying. A Quiet Place is perhaps one of the best monster films ever made and easily the best horror of the year so far.>>A<<",10,32,65,9 April 2018
Event Horizon," Interstellar + Hellraiser? Not quite // instagram: moviesmaniax
","Interstellar + Hellraiser? Not quite. This is a sci-fi/horror film with similar concepts but ultimately fails to be nearly as good as them. First off, the character development here is so dull and sometimes dumb with a script that doesn't seem to reach to its full potential and just falls short. However, the set production here is impressively epic as well as its atmospheric SCARES and inventive bloody GORE scenes but that seems to be all this film has to offer. The film just feels cheesier and dumber as it goes but still entertaining throughout nonetheless. Overall, this is a classic sci-fi/horror film that may not be the worst but still far from the best of Paul W.S. Anderson's films, lots of potential and quite epic in production but not so much in its storytelling.>>B-<<",6,0,1,19 February 2015
Guardians of the Galaxy," One of the best that a scifi/action films could offer! // instagram: moviesmaniac
","From James Gunn, director of Slither and Super comes a whole new epic action galaxy hero universe, Guardians of the Galaxy. While the plot of this film may feel too overstuffed at times, but the film is surely one hell of a ride!! GOTG is visually dazzling with breathtaking action sequences and is one of the best a scifi/action film could offer. The characters here are also very likable and very engaging to watch with their humors and hearts. The film also has so many catchy soundtrack moment that it could almost become a musical film but anyway the songs are great and really live up to the mood/tone of the scenes. The 3D effects are quite better than expected (as seen from the trailer) and really makes the action scenes more enjoyable to watch. Overall, this may not be Marvel's best film but it's surely one of the most entertaining and action-packed ones! >>B+<<",8,8,18,31 July 2014
Jurassic World," Oh man, I just wish this film was rated R // instagram: moviesmaniax
","Oh man, I just wish this film was rated R. This is a new chapter to Jurassic Park that can perfectly stand on its own. The film has many scenes that remind us of the original film with bigger action sequences and visual epicness. While the film may not be as SCARY and intensely thrilling as the original but it's guaranteed to entertain the hell out of you for its whole running time. What I really wish here is if this film was to be rated R, it will definitely be a bloodbath horror show that will surely satisfy horror fans but no doubt that this is a family film, so just saying. However, that doesn't mean the movie is tame at all, considering it as a hard PG-13 rating with a surprise amount of GORY scenes and deaths to bring more horror and thrill to the story and the 3D helps add those up as well. Overall, Jurassic World is a film that can perfectly stand on its own while respecting and perhaps brings more entertainment value than original does.>>A-<<",9,24,59,11 June 2015
The Witch," In 2014, we have The Babadook. In 2015, we have It Follows. In 2016, we have THE WITCH // instagram: moviesmaniax
","In 2014, we have The Babadook. In 2015, we have It Follows. And so far in 2016, we have ourselves another horror masterpiece, The Witch. First time writer-director, Roger Eggers, has delivered a movie that is soul-shaking, intensely disturbing, and gleefully Satanic enough that will likely satisfy most horror fans who can tolerate slow-burn style of movie. The Witch slowly builds its tension and thanks to its terrific production, performance, and music, all of which fit perfectly to create a dreadful tone and pressuring the audience the whole way through.Like It Follows, the music in The Witch is just haunting and uneasy to listen to and really plays a huge part in creating the eerie atmosphere and tension effectively. The visual here is just as stunning and compelling as well with a brilliant production and setting that makes us feel like we are watching something we are not supposed to. While the story-line is not as spectacular as other elements in the film but it still manages to delivery the theme of faith and human nature effectively enough through the talented performance from all the cast. Even though this is a slow-burn horror film but it never gets boring as there are always something interesting and captivating to look at and the pacing here is just nicely flow with its tension rising up and down throughout the whole film.The Witch doesn't rely on any cheap scares, like most modern horror film did, or over-the-top gore to shock the audience but rather its theme and concept that really creeps the hell out of them and delivers a spine-chilling experience. The Witch succeeds in almost every aspect in filmmaking giving horror fans an eerily rich and devilish experience that's pleasantly disturbing throughout. It's excited to see what the writer-director, Robert Eggers, has to offer in the near future as he has proved with The Witch that there's still hope for a horror filmmaking once again.>>A-<<",9,1,6,24 February 2016
What We Do in the Shadows," Hilarious! Hilarious! Hilarious! // instagram: moviesmaniax
","Hilarious! Hilarious! Hilarious! New Zealand has made it again with my last year's favorite Housebound and now What We Do In The Shadows is my new favorite and best horror/comedy film of 2015!! Not only all the characters here are absolutely hilarious but the mockumentary concept of this film is just brilliant. Think the mixed of Behind The Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon and a bit of Cabin In The Woods and you will get this vampire twisted-genre film that pokes fun at several vampire references and will make you laugh like crazy from start till finish. There are some SCARY make-up and jump scares here but overall the film is more of a comedy so don't go in expecting any of that kind like Housebound as well as the GORES. While the plot may not seem to be fully developed enough but as long as it can crack you up all the way through with several laugh-out-loud moments, plus making fun of the genre you love, that's just all it takes for me for a successful horror/comedy film >>A<<",10,1,4,11 March 2015
Deadpool," The filthiest, most entertaining, and hilarious superhero movie in the Marvel universe! // instagram: moviesmaniax
","Ryan Reynolds returns once again as Deadpool after his first appearance in X-Men Origin. Expect the unexpected in the most anticipated R-rated superhero film of the year that will blow your brains out, literally.After the failure of rebooting Fantastic Four last year, 20th Century Fox finally redeems itself with Deadpool and takes a risk in releasing this with an R-rating, which is really rare for a mainstream superhero film these days, but the result clearly shows that they made the right decision. Deadpool has a pretty basic plot about a guy getting revenge and killing people along the way. While it may not have a fancy plot like other superhero movies, the result is beyond satisfying and lives up to its premise. The whole movie is filled with non-stop raunchy humour as well as a delightful amount of bloody, violent action sequences that are refreshing and certainly will entertain the hell out of you throughout its running time. This is a movie that totally deserves its R-rating (for strong violence and language throughout, sexual content and graphic nudity). I'm pleased to see that they didn't choose to go soft by giving it a PG-13 rating to gain more audiences, which in that case, would have totally limit the movie's potential. Thanks to that decision, you all can now expect lots of violence and nasty dialogue and prepare to laugh your guts out.Also, the important element that makes all this all work is the cast. Ryan Reynolds is perfect for this role, which reminds us what a big mistake it was to shut his mouth in X-Men: Origin. Deadpool here is just as foul-mouthed and filthy as you expect him to be. Without a great supporting cast, this movie wouldn't have been this satisfying. T.J. Miller, Rachel Sheen, Brainna Hildebrand (as Warhead), and scene-stealer Leslie Uggams (as Blind Al) all did a great job portraying their characters and adding a great comedic touch and chemistry with our Deadpool and naturally balanced their performance really well. And trying not to give anything away, Stan Lee also has one of the best cameos you will ever see in a Marvel movie.Overall, with its gleeful violence and non-stop raunchy humour, Deadpool turns its simple plot into the filthiest, most entertaining, and hilarious superhero movie in the Marvel universe.>>A<<",10,3,13,12 February 2016
Alien: Covenant," I like the way these dumb characters die // INSTAGRAM: MOVIESMANIAX
","Congrats horror fans! You just got yourself one hell of a bloody ride in space here. Alien: Covenant serves as a prequel to Alien (1979) and a sequel to Prometheus (2012) and it does a great job filling the story gap while delivering intense, gruesome, and bloody action-packed moments for the audience and fans of the series. There are also plenty of GORY scenes here that will delight horror fans, yet most of them are pretty much just replications of the previous films but nonetheless, you will still get a blood-splattering, stomach-ripping, and gut-gushing experience, just like the good old days. However, the main problem of this film is perhaps, beside Michael Fassbender, most of the characters here are just dumb, loud, and excellent at making bad decisions, which can be irritating to watch at times. Also, there isn't really anyone you would care or cheer for, but rather just waiting to see how and when they would end up dead. Overall, there are enough suspenseful action sequences, gleeful twists, and impressive visual effects that would make up for some eye- rolling moments and weak characters, making Alien: Covenant still a bloody satisfying and delightfully gory experience for the fans of the series.>>B+<<TWITTER: moviesmaniaCX",8,3,6,15 June 2017
