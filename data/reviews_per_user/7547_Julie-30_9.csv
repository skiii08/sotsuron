The Blair Witch Project," Idiotic, stupid, inane, boring... Take your pick.
","The only scary thing about this movie is how bad it was. 
The 'students' were absolute cretins. If you find a river or a stream when you're lost, YOU FOLLOW IT!  Some people were nauseated by the herky-jerky camera work.  This is not what offended me.  What offended me is that they were stealing my money and underestimating my intelligence.  The reviewer who praised their marketing skills hit the nail right on the head.  This was a great money-making scheme.  I'm normally not taken in by hype, but a friend was dying to see it, so I tagged along.  This friend said she was scared, but I was sitting next to her trying not to laugh at how dumb the whole thing was.To each her own...",1,13,24,30 April 2003
Miracle," Absolutely incredible.
","Yes, I knew how it ended, but that didn't stop me from sitting on the edge of my seat with my heart in my throat for the games.  They did a great job re-creating the period, and a stupendous job with the hockey scenes. I especially liked the 'where are they now' montage at the end.
The casting was fabulous -- Kurt Russell WAS Herb Brooks.In addition, I really liked how they used the actual broadcast commentary from Al Michaels and Ken Dryden during the games because that really brought back the feel of the time.  People applauded every US goal and every US save.  They stood and applauded when it was over. This is the ultimate feel-good movie, and I for one, am completely unashamed of the patriotism. It was an accurate portrayal of life at that time; a time when people in the US needed what these boys gave them.Good job Disney!",8,0,0,31 January 2004
The Rookie," I loved it.
","'The Rookie' is indeed based on a true story.  I heard an interview with Jim Morris, the man on whose life the film is based, and he said that the film had not been 'Hollywoodized.'  While some things were added or deleted to make the story fit, the overwhelming majority of what you see on film actually happened.  He did have a difficult relationship with his father. He did challenge his students to win their District title in exchange for a promise to try out for a professional baseball team. He did get called up and pitch his first game as a Devil Ray at The Ballpark in Arlington.  He did strike out the first batter he faced.  And so on, and so on.While they did clean up the language one would normally hear in a clubhouse, the rest of the film rings true to life.  Quaid is outstanding as Jim Morris, and Rachel Griffiths is delightful as his loving wife, Lorri.  The young men who played the members of the high school baseball team he coached had just the right amount of teenage swagger.  I cannot recommend this film enough.  It proves what I've always believed, that 'Baseball is life; the rest is just details.'",Null,0,0,30 March 2002
The English Patient," What pretentious trash! This and Titanic are reasons I didn't watch the Oscars this year.
","I started falling asleep about 10 minutes into this garbage, and only stayed because I was there with a friend who was enthralled and didn't want to leave.  I'm still friends with her, but...I don't know how many people know the 'story behind the story.' In real life, the Count was a homosexual and a Nazi sympathizer, both of which make the story on screen even more absurd (if that's possible).
The only character in the whole film I liked was Juliette Binoche.  Other than her character, this predictable, boring film was a waste of time, energy and money.  Avoid it at all costs!",1,5,11,24 March 1999
Bridget Jones's Diary," Loved it!!!!
","I've read the book more than once, and was a little leery of the film, but those fears were completely unfounded.  This movie was truly one of the funniest I've seen in a long time.I know that some feminists don't like this character, but they just don't seem to get it. I am a woman of a certain age and, while I can't say I know anyone who is exactly like Bridget, I can say that every woman I know has some elements of Bridget in her.  Whether or not the anti-Bridget factions like to admit it, women have always obsessed about their weight, or about men, or about their parents, or whatever.  What the people who snub their noses at this book/movie fail to see is that Mark Darcy has his own neuroses.  This is a man whose mother who shows a dubious taste in Christmas gifts (but he loves her enough to wear them in public), a man whose wife had an affair with his best friend (but is too much of a gentleman to discuss it), a man who wants to have fun but who isn't really sure just how.  Hence his attraction to Bridget.  But since the story is told from Bridget's point of view, we dwell on her problems, not Mark's.  Bridget is Everywoman, and Renee Zellwegger turns in a stellar performance in this role.Colin Firth, who was a fine Fitzwilliam Darcy in the 1995 version of Pride & Prejudice, is, in my humble opinion, even better as Mark Darcy in this modern twist on the Austen novel.  Hugh Grant should stick with playing cads and forget about the stammering leading man he has played once too often. He is wonderful as the Wickham-like character who has no scruples about taking what he wants, regardless of the consequences.Gemma Jones and Jim Broadbent are terrific as Brigdet's parents.  Jones is delightful as the ditzy mother who goes off to 'find herself,' only to discover that her real happiness lies at home.  I would have liked to have seen more of Broadbent, but it was not to be, unfortunately.From what I gather, the closing credits seen in Europe are different from those seen in North America.  While Europeans get to see interviews with Bridget's family and friends, we North Americans get to see home movies of Mark's 8th birthday party. Not surprisingly, Bridget is the life of the party; she stuffs cake into her mouth and strips down before jumping into the paddling pool while Mark sits quietly and watches.  I can only hope the DVD has both endings. I've seen the film twice, and I have to say I managed to laugh even harder the second time.  My advice to the naysayers?  Lighten up.  This movie is FUN.",9,1,1,29 April 2001
Bridget Jones's Diary," v.v.g.
","Yesterday, I saw it for the second time, and it was just as delightful as it was the first time.  In fact, I may have laughed harder because I was able to catch things I had missed the first time.  Renee Zellwegger was great, Colin Firth was (sigh) wonderful, Hugh Grant was a brilliant cad, Gemma Jones and Jim Broadbent were terrific... I could go on forever.  True, it doesn't follow the book exactly, but the departures worked for me.  'Pride & Prejudice' is one of my favorite books, and BJD does for P&P what 'Clueless' did for 'Emma' and 'Metropolitan' did for 'Mansfield Park.'  It's a modernization that shows respect for the original.I'll probably see it a couple of more times before the DVD comes out.  Does anyone know when this is scheduled?",9,0,0,22 April 2001
Chariots of Fire," Truly an outstanding film.
","I beg to differ with several previous reviewers.  This film is neither bland nor is it solely about professionalism vs. amateurism.This film is about what drives people to do what they do.  Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson) runs for the glory of God, whereas Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross) runs to prove his worth to a society that was anti-Semitic.  Even though they run for different reasons, their drive and determination spur them on. They stand up for what they believe in and refuse to sacrifice their principles because it is the easy way out. The supporting cast is also extraordinary, with Nigel Havers, Nicholas Farrell, Ian Holm and Sir John Gielgud all making important contributions to the final product. There is absolutely nothing unnecessary in this film.  The writing, the direction, the acting, the dialogue are all outstanding.  And then there's that haunting score.  Once again, this is truly an outstanding film. One with universal themes that transcend time and place.",9,126,146,26 January 2003
Titanic," Lord, I hated this movie!
","This movie has it all - horrible casting, lame dialogue, abysmal acting... What more could you ask for in an award-winning film? The awards I am thinking of, of course, are the Razzies.I wish!I started looking at my watch and squirming within 10 minutes. This film could not end soon enough for me.Besides the above, I was furious that Cameron also tried to revise history and make Rose into a 1990s woman.  A gently raised young lady in that time and that place would a)never have been the only person on board who knew that there were not enough life boats for all the passengers; b)never have heard of 'Mr. Picasso' and 'Dr. Freud.'  In addition, 3rd class passengers would NEVER (I repeat, NEVER) have been allowed on a 1st class deck, and vice versa.  I also found it insulting that all the poor people were noble and all the rich people (except Rose of course) were evil.I kept thinking about Joe Queenan's comment: 'Sink the damned boat already!' I never thought I'd find myself rooting for the iceberg.",Null,3,4,24 March 1999
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," I loved it!
","I thought that Fargo was brilliant and that The Big Lebowski was stupid, but I loved O Brother to death.  The music is right up my alley, and George Clooney surprised me with his performance. The comment about his accent coming and going interested me.  Clooney was born in Lexington, Kentucky and grew up in the suburbs of Cincinnati, so a southern accent is not entirely foreign to him.  I thought he did a creditable job with it.
Charles Durning has made a very good living playing good ol' boys, and he does his usual stellar job here.  Holly Hunter's character doesn't have much screen time, but she definitely made the best of it.Yes, the story is pretty silly, but I rarely take anything seriously so it didn't bother me in the slightest.  On the contrary, I laughed more here than I have since Chicken Run.",8,0,0,29 December 2000
