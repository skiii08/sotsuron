The Avengers," THIS is how you spent 200 million on a movie
","I am a huge Marvel geek, so if you are not 100% into Marvel or superhero movies, you should take the following with a grain of salt: Avengers is everything I ever dreamed of and lived for. It is like I was a child again, watching in awe with my mouth wide open.Whedon nailed nearly every single scene. He made every superhero movie which is already out look very outdated. This movie is 140 minutes maybe and 130 minutes are money shots. I have to find new superlatives and words are still not enough if I wanted to describe my feelings. And after seeing the trailer and the pictures, I already had high expectations.The charisma of Captain America, the wild brutality of the Hulk, the majesty of Thor, it was all there. I was never the biggest fan of avengers, but right now, after writing these lines, I am going to read up some avenger comic books from my collection and we have 2 am.THIS is how you spend 200 million on a movie.",10,6,13,27 April 2012
Sucker Punch," This movie is not realistic and does not want to be
","I have to add yet another review of this movie, because in all the above it came to my mind that one thing is not standing out enough: Sucker Punch is no realistic movie and it does not try to be! Yes, the characters are not super developed, yes the action is over the top, yes the movie does not get the tension out of the fights. You guys are absolutely right about this.But this movie is also interesting because you care about Baby Doll and her being lobotomized or not. It is great because the action is so beautifully filmed that you won't forget the scenes for a long time. And this movie is far deeper than most would expect. You just have to use your brain which seems to be difficult, because in most movies that are made like sucker, you don't need any brain.If you liked the style of 300 and you can like a movie even though it is not realistic, you will also like this movie... I did, very much even.",9,2,7,10 April 2011
Skyfall," feels very artificial and constructed
","Finally I have seen the movie to see what the fuzz is all about. But this Bond adventure left me disappointed, here are the reasons: 1. The 'super hacker and PC geek' is really getting annoying and is slowly taking first place as a lazy story vehicle from 'the prophecy told us so'. Explode something with hacking a computer? yeah, sure... I am not sure that my mom would buy this and she has problems watching a DVD.2. Nearly everything in this movie feels like the director or writer wants it to go there and does not feel organic or in a natural flow. For example, why should Bond use a house in a very open area for a fight when he is outnumbered? Just because he was born there? There was no advantage for him picking that building, with the exception of the 'secret passage'.3. There is no real Bond - girl in this movie. Every woman in this feels really tagged on. There is no real chemistry between Bond and his sexual partners in this movie.4. I could not follow the decisions of the characters. 'Take the shot' - scene for example: Chances for Bond to retrieve the hard drive was quite high, especially considering Bonds reputation. Shooting a moving/fighting target on a moving train from that far away really only makes your chance bigger if you really make sure that you kill the target and that would mean that she must kill Bond, too. So why did M order the shot and why did the girl not shoot multiple times so that she can make sure to retrieve the hard drive? 5. Unbelievable developments, like, did anyone really understand why Bond cannot hit anything in the mid of the movie, but near the end he takes masterful shots with an old rifle? I don't want to go too much into detail and nitpick everything. I believe that this movie might be quite cool for some people. But for me, a natural flow, believable characters and decisions are what makes a good movie. 'Skyfall' was an entertaining movie, but not a great one.",5,11,25,5 November 2012
Aquaman," This is very, very far away from a 10 or even a great movie
","A 9 for me is the perfect movie, a 10 means, it is pushing all the right buttons for me. The 6 means, it is really average, but genrefans might like it. A 7 would be a recommendation to buy the BluRay, but I certainly cannot recommend anything like this.From all the critics and the ratings I really thought this is going to be a good movie. Here are some points, why it is not:<ul><li>Nicole Kidman and 'the father' have 0 chemistry. Why in earth would a queen be interested in this guy? We will never know. When they meet again at the end of the movie at the dock and run towards each other, I actually laughed.</li><li>Amber Heard cannot act very well. She is a beautiful woman, no doubt, but she could not carry her weight in the story</li><li>Jason Momoa cannot act good enough for a main lead. He can act, he has done a good job, but there are way too many scenes where he fails miserably to transport emotions. Just playing the badass is not enough.</li><li>What is up with the extremely colourful, over the top CGI? If I want to watch a big war like this, I will watch a space opera. Not a single time I thought 'cool', all the time I thought 'hey this is like shooting scenes in the 70s: long, drawn out, completely meaningless without anything really happening for minutes'.</li><li>The story was completely predictable from minute one. The only 'twist' was for me that Aquaman was not betrayed by the character of Willem Dafoe</li><li>the costumes look so plastic, the weaponry, the armor, here was a possibility to show creativity: How would weapon and armor look like of an army from the deep sea? The movies answer: Just like on land, only colourful and plastique looking</li><li>again 0 chemistry between Momoa and Heard..... why would they love each other? Because the script says so?</li><li>really, why is Aquaman 'worthy'? Because the script says so? Why should a creature that protects a weapon for 1000s of years (without eating anything, biology anyone?) hand that weapon over to Aquaman? Because he is like King Arthur and pulls Excalibur from King Atlan? That was so cheesy and stolen, it made me cringe in the inside.</li><li>I nearly forgot about the 'Black Manta'.... when he was on screen with his ridiculously big helmet for the first time, I had to laugh. Is there a more laughable, ridiculous villain in any movie?</li></ul>I am actually really sorry for the DC fans. While Wonder Woman was a great movie, amazing timing and good enough acting, this is the only movie that stands out. Everything else is just not good.
Justice League or Aquaman are so far away from the quality of even 'average' Marvel movies, it hurts.",6,1,3,9 May 2019
X-Men," after 20 years this is my new favourite
","In 1979 I have seen the light. Looking through my childish eyes I have watches Star Wars and made it my favourite. Never will one film top this, because I will never be a child again. And I will never be so enthusiastic like a child again.But this was a big mistake. X- Men breaks through. Nothing left to make this film better. All perfect. Just for me. Because I am a great fan of the comics. The X- Men in the film are not just incarnations, they certainly ARE the X- Men. So if you love the comics, you love the film. A female friend of mine who didnt ever read a comic of X- Men and who hates Actionfilms loved it, too. So go out and look. And forget about films of superheros, you have already seen. X- Men is the future. Any other films with superheroes must beat this one. I loved Batman I + II (rest is crap), but X- Men is much better.Enjoy. Remember, I am a great fan of X- Men, but every other spectator will find it at least very good (except you reality-'why can those people fly'-guys)cu",10,0,0,31 August 2000
Spider-Man 3," not as good as part 2, but still amazing
","Judging as an action junkie, I love this film, I love the action, and the SFX might be the best you are going to see in a long time. In roughly 2 and a half hours, I never watched at the clock, it felt like I have hold my breath for the entire time.Being a Spidey Comic Fan, I love this movie... the characters are very deep and you can always feel like they feel in the movie. And I must admit it: I love Gwen Stacy ;) Being a fan of intense stories and drama, this movie ranks very high. Some of the dialogues were a bit cheesy, but nevertheless I loved it.Being a big fan of spider-Man 2, I am a bit disappointed. Spider-Man 2 is better, but Spider-Man 3 is still one of the best movies out there and most probably the best movie in 2007.",9,6,17,30 April 2007
Interstellar," thanks for mixing Science with Fiction
","I have read a lot of reviews about this movie. Yes, there are plot holes, but think about all the other movies we get these days and you cannot possibly say that this wasn't a huge, huge step forward.There are not many SF films any more, these days they are action packed movies in a futuristic environment. What made SF for me when I was young was the stretching of my mind, the endless possibilities and last but not least the feeling of how awesome it would be if it would really happen.And when they launched the spaceship, when the main character was talking about exploration, I felt like a kid again.If you compare this movie with reality as we perceive it now, if you look eagerly for every little plot hole to point out that the movie is not as accurate as it seems to proclaim, yes, it will fail for you. At the same time you watch the horrendous depiction of physics in movies like Fast & Furious 29 and feel entertained.I for myself decided to be a bit more forgiving. The masses seem not to be ready for highly complex SF films. A 'dumb' character is needed these days in all flicks to explain even the most simple twists. The overwhelming majority is more interested in Superstars than in Physics. And in these times I am more than grateful for a movie like this.It was not only entertaining, it was thought provoking and it was beautifully photographed. The movie could have been way worse and I still would rate it 10 stars.Thank you very much for this movie and please make more films like this.",10,2,7,3 April 2015
The Bourne Ultimatum," nice movie, but shaky cam makes the experience foul
","I have seen the movie yesterday and because of the 'to be expected' shaky cam, my expectations were low. Many friends told me that the movie is intelligent and I wondered why. Bourne is quite clever, he solves his problems with force most of the time (come on, no funny Star Wars jokes now)and he always seems a tad ahead in regards to his opponents. Does that make an intelligent movie?The movie itself is not intelligent. There are no surprising elements, you know who is good and who is bad from the beginning and after 5 minutes I already knew the ending. Despite of these facts, Bourne ultimatum is a rock solid movie, it goes by too fast to let you think too much of it.So far, so good... I would rate the movie 7 or 8 stars, BUT let us speak about a feature which finds its way into more and more movies, the 'shaky cam'I did not like the shaky cam in 'the shield', I did not like it in Bourne 2 and because of this I was prepared for the worst (so I thought): So you make this Big Budget movie and you want to make it look like an amateur has filmed something with his mobile phone camera. Why?The cam zooms straight in the faces till you can see even skin irritations. You have one cut in like every second. Maybe to show how 'hectic' the situation is. But this makes the viewer think of the situation, because he cannot really see what is going on.Let us take Bournes brawl with the agent in Marocco. You don't really see something of the fight, you don't know, who is superior, you cannot even see why Bourne wins the fight at the end. Was he just luckier or was he smarter or stronger? Only the 'shaky cam' knows.But while this fight is OK made and the chase above the roof tops of Morocco is quite OK, the car chase is just a bad joke. In no scene you can really tell who is driving where and from what direction someone is chasing. Hell, at the end of this chase, I don't even know if Bourne is pulling some clever stunt or the other agent is making a mistake. I just see Bourne taking his safety belt and ducking and Bourne is conscious again faster. Why is that?A good movie shows a nice composition, well shot pictures, good fighting moves and interesting cuts. Bourne has neither of these elements. If a movie is shot similarly and I get to know about it, I will stay away from it, simple as that.I could bear the 'shaky cam' if the director would use it in some situations, but in the whole movie, it is just annoying and looks like it is shot from an amateur. Maybe the 'shaky cam' is good for low budget movies. You can save some money and still make fights and car chases so shaky that the viewer cannot really judge if it is well done or in a bad way. But in a big budget movie like Bourne, an interesting part of the movies, the action scenes, loose my interest, because you cannot see what is going on.Yeah, I know what you are going to say... the director uses the 'shaky cam' to show how hectic everything is. You know what? A soccer match, is hectic, too, but if they are showing the matches in this way and I only see some trousers, hands and dirt flying around, only interrupted from some shaky shots to the audience that are happy about a goal, I stop watching soccer. If you like it, good for you, but when I have to think 90% of the time about something that does not even belong to the story, this cannot be right.I really tried to be open minded about the style and the movie. But my opinion is firm now. A cam should be, like the score of the movie, be there to help the mood and the movie, but not be the main focus of my first view.What a pity, Bourne is a nice movie (it does not belong in the IMDb top 250 though), but I have to take away 2 points for 'shaky cam'. Seriously, if you are a director and read this... stop this, thank you. We don't like it, it does not make the movie interesting, I hate it and it makes the movie annoying. Salt makes a meal taste better, but if you add to much to it, you ruin the meal and when you take as much as 'shaky cam' in Bourne, it can even be a danger for your health.",5,0,1,21 September 2007

Justice League," a lot of achievements from the DC team inside
","Let us take note for the following achievements: 
<ul><li>making Batman look useless and uncool</li><li>most boring CGI villain in the history of villainry</li><li>most underwhelming fight in the history of superhero movies</li><li>most predictable surprise revivification, the anti-6th-sense so to speak (who would have thought that Superman will live again?)</li><li>movie with most CGI usage (99% of all backgrounds), making the movie very unrealistic</li><li>remember shows like Airwolf when they used some action scenes again and again and again, because of budget issues? Well, this movie gets an achievement for the first 300 Mio dollar movie using this 'technique': Wonder Woman attacking, getting hit by villain, Aquaman going in and using a distraction to save her... rinse...repeat</li><li>most useless character in an endfight (Cyborg dude playing with 3 rubiks cubes the whole fight)</li></ul>So why the 6 points you ask?
<ul><li>Wonder Woman</li><li>Some very good action scenes in between</li><li>overall enjoyable movie experience, better than average for sure (and 6 points means for me: better than average)</li><li>even worth buying the BluRay, if you are into DC and superhero movies, but making fun of movies is sooo much fun, I had to do it, sorry</li></ul>",6,0,0,5 April 2018
Trouble with the Curve," Everyone is right
","This movie is cliché ridden, foreseeable, there were some bad dialogs and still I liked this movie because of the characters.Still, the story is paper thin, this is not a very creative movie and I would not suggest this movie to everyone as the best movie ever. But I fell in love about how this story is told. It is slow, it has great pictures in it, lovable characters. When the credits roll, you just feel good about it. I always rate movies about their ability to entertain. There was not one minute when I had to watch my clock, it felt very short and so it gets a good rating. Because this is what entertainment is all about, isn't it?",9,1,2,6 June 2013
Gone Girl," watchable, but nowhere near a masterpiece
","There are plenty of reviews for this movie, so I will spare you most of the review stuff. Just in short: Characters good, movie interesting, interesting twists, but the ending is too far of a stretchThe one reason why this movie in my opinion does not belong anywhere near the top250: This movie is not believable on an emotional basis. SPOILER How could anyone stay together with a psychopath like that? It was portrayed several times that the male main character of the movie was neither in love with her any more nor did he care too much about the public opinion./SPOILERSo basically the final twist was too much for me. Up to this point I would rate it 8 points, but this has cost the movie 2 points.",6,0,3,25 February 2015
X-Men: The Last Stand," you can bend rules, but don't break them
","Sorry to say, but this movie is one of the worst filmish disappointments of my life. You can bend the rules of comics, but you must not break them. Brett Rattner does not respect the X-Men Comics and so I hate it. I was not expecting much after I heard of the chaos, but even my low expectations were too high. If you do not know the comics, this movie might be by far better for you, but if you happen to like them, you are going to hate the movie.In contrast to X-Men 1 + 2 the actors are appearing exhausted and did not seem to have much motivation to make the movie. The movie uses brute force to touch my feelings, but it does not succeed at all. I always felt like cheated and the movie was surreal, because it was so far away from the comic novels. You wait till they take back the development of the movie, but they don't.",3,36,112,24 May 2006
Guardians of the Galaxy," not the best, but maybe the most entertaining movie
","You can always nitpick, Guardians lacks depth, it is very colorful, there could be better character development, but while you watch this movie, you will be entertained. And you will be entertained in a way that you might have not been entertained before.Make no mistake, this is an action packed movie full of space opera (spaceships battling), fantasy (talking Racoons) and cute trees fighting for the greater good. So if you like movies about the real world, this is not for you. But you might have guessed it when you have seen that this movie is from Marvel.But for all others, this movie is highly, highly recommended. It mixes hilarious jokes, great action and fight scenes with memorable characters in such a great way, that you might wonder why not every movie is so entertaining and so funny. This movie felt like 30 minutes, it was over way too fast. And it leaves you in your seat, starting to count the days for the sequel.Rocket Racoon might be the most hilarious and lovable character ever created in fantasy. Every line of this little guy leaves behind a thunder of laughter.I don't know if it is better than Avengers and to be honest, I don't want to be the judge. Some will like it more, some will like it less. And my guess is, if I have seen this movie several times, I might see some faults in it. But until this day, I start counting twice, one time for the days till the sequel finally hits the screen and the other time for the BluRay release.If you have not seen this movie yet, I envy you, because you are about to be blown away.",10,9,21,25 July 2014
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Transformers 3 director will be a poor bastard
","If Bay is not directing Transformers 3 (and he won't if he has seen his own movie) I pity the fool who is doing the job.Transformers 3 will have a huge budget, but in cinemas it will fail. Not because I can see the future or I think no one else than Bay can do it, but because Transformers 2 is a huge fail and everyone who has seen the movie in the theatres (and everyone is doing it since no one believes what a bad movie this really is) won't be there to watch Transformers 3. Now the guys who will give the money for this are expecting a huge blockbuster which gives millions of $$, because Transformers 1 + 2 were such awesomely done flicks (in their head, maybe because of $$).Now get inside yourself for one minute and think about who will get the blame if Transformers 3 won't be such a huge success?So if you hate directing and want to look for another job, this is your chance.And yes, this is my way of expressing how shitty the movie was (compared to the possibilities).",4,2,17,29 June 2009
12 Years a Slave," 150 years roughly and we still learned nothing
","The movie was directed in a boring way. Nothing unexpected, we have seen movies like this a lot of times. It was not that special. The acting was great, the pictures were disturbing, but I have seen better movies. But the movie is still very important, because we have learned nothing from these dark ages. Back in these days, white men thought that black men are animals, not the same, that they can be treated in a very bad way. How did we learn nothing from it, you ask? We try to spread our human rights to everyone in the world? Well, we do the very same to many animals in the world. We torture them, put them in cages, kill them in the millions. And we only do this because we think, we are superior, we think, animals are not like us. So it is important to remind us again and again that our humanity and decency is not only for those we think comparable to us, but for everything on our world that lives and breathes. Sorry for this derail... movie was mediocre, move on ;)",6,3,5,31 May 2015
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Episode III just showed how good EP IV-VI was
","Yes, basically I have endured all 3 movies (ep I-III) just because the classic trilogy was THAT good. We all hoped for the genius to come back to Star Wars and when I have read the remarkable comments on EP III, I had hopes for the new trilogy.But I was so wrong. EP III lacks one thing: Emotions The ingredients were awesome, brave warriors, great love, treachery, a friendship that was more like 2 brothers, but the result was bad. I did not live with the characters in one single scene. Padme dies, no biggie, Anakin turned over to the dark side... I did not care, all Jedis died, I felt the urge to empty my bladder. I did not believe that Anakin and Padme loved each other, I did not believe the reasons for Anakins turn that Lucas gave us, I did not feel for Obi Wan who had to battle his old friend. In fact, I was watching the stunning special effects and the action, but not at the characters. As a result, my 2 favorite characters were Joda and R2-D2... one was CGI and the other a robot who cannot even speak. The movie was not bad, but take away the Star Wars feeling and the really big budget and you have a movie that could be Riddick 2. George Lucas, you failed and I am sad because a great opportunity is missed. It was a nice history lesson, but like my history lessons in school, I was in danger of falling asleep the whole time. Yes there are many fanboys who like this movie, but in 20 years, no one is going to speak of Ep I-III, the people will still watch the classic trilogy.",7,0,1,25 May 2005
Arrival," Not for everyone
","Let me start with: I hope that many, many SF fans love this movie so that we see mind blowing, thought provoking blockbusters like this more often. But the movie is not for everyone. If you are not familiar with concepts of dimensions, if you cannot bear a movie without action, you won't be a happy consumer. If you appreciate movies for being unique, if you love slow movies which live and breathe with their atmosphere and characters and if you just like SF and science, you are going to love this one. The next part contains heavy spoilers so don't read on if you have not seen the movie yet. The final reveal is mind blowing in its truest meaning of the word. So get ready, fasten your seat belt and watch this one. I have read many one star reviews and they all boil down to: I hate the flashbacks, time moves too fast, things do not happen in a correct order. Well, this is the big catch of the movie. That time as we perceive it, is perceived in another way. Time is a concept that we have. In reality, it is a dimension. There are theories that everything is available at this very moment. But we perceive it in a flowing way, because we cannot grasp reality in another way. To understand this concept, let us look a level lower, at a 2D scenario. If there are creatures that live in 2D only, how would they perceive a 3D structure? Imagine they live in the page of a book. They could only understand a body as a flow of 1000 pages. Each page would look like one photo of a CT scan. And only all 1000 pages together would form a 3D structure. We perceive time the same way. Only our 1000 pages of a book are 1000 seconds or 1000 years. But it might very well be a possibility, that everything is present at all times, we just cannot grasp it that way. In the movie, Louise starts to break this barrier. Time stops being represented by a flow, but Louise can see all events at the same time. She does not need 1000 CT scans to see a body, she can see it right away as a whole. This is the reason why she sees flashbacks of a daughter that does not even exist. Or why the question of having a baby seems to come so early in the relationship. Because there is no 'late' or 'early' or 'future' or 'past' for Louise any more. And if you understand this, you can feel the beauty of this movie with full force. Even though there is so much pain for her, she still accepts the flow of time as we understand it. She still wants to have her daughter even though she knows that she will die early because of disease. And even though she knows that her husband will leave her, she accepts his love in the first place. Because it is not about the destination, it is about the journey.I hope I could help a little to make you see this movie as I see it. A beautiful masterpiece that makes you a better person in the end.",10,5,11,29 March 2017
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," not my type of movie, but it can surely be good for others
","I rated this movie with 4 stars. Let me explain what this means: This movie is very much OK for a special audience, but I don't like it and I would not recommend it to my friends. For me movies are about entertainment, about relating to something or someone, to find myself in the movie. The very second that this movie decided to put in superpowers (maybe as a metaphor for the superhuman feelings that some Hollywood stars have) and show the main actor flying around (and I very well understand that he might not really have superpowers and it more about the metaphor), I just disconnected. I must admit, maybe I am too simple minded, that movies like Birdman, Naked Lunch or most of Lynchs work don't interest me too much. Despite this I could enjoy Mulholland Drive (so maybe I am not a hopeless case), but when it becomes too crazy, I disconnect and this makes those movies not even bad, but boring. Same goes for the work of I get it that this movie is a satire, I even get the message and I hope that I understand the tools that were used. Same goes for Nicolas Winding Refn, I loved Drive, but I don't enjoy his other work or Darren Aronofskys work except Black Swan. There are several types of people who enjoy movies. Some like it as a form of art, some look it for entertainment, some look it for whole other reasons. I have seen probably 10.000s of movies in my life and a movie that tries to do things differently is really a great thing. But Birdman is a bit too far away from being a story. I am happy for everyone who likes this movie, but it surely wasn't for me. I can understand why some people love this movie, but I surely don't. And this is OK, everything that counts is the respect that we should have for other opinions. Not everyone who is different from us is dumb. They are just different. Like this movie... it is just different.",4,0,1,26 March 2016

Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," a fantasy blockbuster lacking ... fantasy and imagination
","Don't get me wrong, the movie is entertaining, maybe even good, but as a long time Star Wars fan you have to be a bit disappointed. This movie is basically a remake of Episode IV, spiced with tiny bits and pieces from the other Star Wars movies. It is like visiting a hyped fashion show and all you see are last years clothes with other colors. From here on there will be SPOILERS and the things that I wondered the most about: 1. Han Solo dies a very meaningless death that feels staged and scripted 2. Carrie Fisher has so much Botox in her face, that she cannot really act. Or she had a stroke and her face is frozen. I apologize if that was the case, I did not read it up. 3. After several years the only thing they come up with is another death star? That is destroyed basically the same way as any other death star? 4. There is a 'map' that shows the way to Luke? Really? If he wants to be found I'd expect that he calls home, if not, why draw a map? This is a very, very cheap story vehicle. 5. Snoke? Couldn't you come up with a better name? :D On a more serious note, I felt caught in an introduction. I never had the feeling that 'now the movie is really starting'. Now the good stuff: 1. Action scenes, especially fights with spaceships, are spot on. 2. Daisy Ridley and John Boyega are very good in their roles, their characters are interesting 3. Definitely feels like a Star Wars movie 4. Way, way better than anything Episode I-III came up with 5. Makes you look forward to the other moviesWell, I know what they were doing. They did not want to put in any risk at all, basically remade Episode IV (oh well, Ep VI is the better remake then)to catch the Star Wars fans. I am sure that we will see more imagination in the next movies. JJ A did what he can do best: Make a visually stunning movie with great action scenes. Nice introduction, but to be honest, I am very happy that he is not the director of the next movie. Judgement: Solid, but uninteresting",7,2,11,17 December 2015

Surely deserving a spot in the top 100 on IMDb.The only thing that you can nitpick is the slight attempt at humor from time to time that does not fit into the context, but to be frank, it does not concern me at all.",10,4,7,6 March 2017
Contact," Science fiction as it was meant to be
","Great to see a film where you do not see ugly aliens and hated foreigners. Science Fiction as it was meant to be. Though there is no real danger for earth, this film is one of the most interesting I have ever seen.",10,0,2,16 October 1998
V for Vendetta," the more often you see the movie, the better it gets
","From being stunned by a very good movie, this film has advanced to the very top of my all-time-favourites. The movie shows the past, the now and the future, this movie is a warning and an inspiration, it is violent and it is wise, it gives us advice and helps us to think.Some movies are just entertaining and interesting. Some movies are truly more than the pictures and the sound, some movies make you think afterwards and it leads to discussion with your friends.And 'V for Vendetta' is both kinds at the same time. It is like popcorn that you can still taste hours after you have eaten it and you have to speak with everyone about it. A must see!",10,3,10,25 July 2007
