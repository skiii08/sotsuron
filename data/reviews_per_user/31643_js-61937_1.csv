Sucker Punch," High Rating as a Cult Classic
","I will try to avoid spoilers and simply give some depth to reviews I have read so far. But I will check the spoiler box just in case.This film is about a Sucker Punch. That is a victim who does not invite the event, and is unaware of it. The lights go out on an unsuspecting or innocent person.A innocent person's lights went out in the film. But as a pure Sucker Punch victim, her identity is on ice until her lights eventually go out for good.She fantasized innocently, but with a nice ferocity, to deal with being drugged and abused. The ferocity inspired her friends to improve their situation in some ways.The character development is in the innocent ferocious fantasies, and that is enough for this film.I liked the first fight the best, but they were all quite good, and fierce, which is what they needed to be. Ferocity is not a male preserve, and the film captured it well.This could easily be a cult classic, if better understood. Filmmakers make films with more depth than they realize, by keeping it simple, which is exactly what this film did.I hope it pays off for the production team in the long run.",9,20,34,9 January 2016
