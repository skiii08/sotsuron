Hereditary," Ultimately a disappointment
","Perhaps I expected a different kind of plot development I watched the story of a woman having to deal with the deaths of her close relatives early in the movie, but as the film's final scene ended, I felt cheated. Toni Collette gave a very convincing portrayal of the woman unable to mentally cope with the horrors inflicted on her. Her descent to madness was slow and building so well that her behavior at the end was very abrupt and ultimately unconvincing to me. To make it worse, the rushed ending forced the creaky 'tell but not show' plot device to explain everything.Also the modern day setting didn't make sense. The isolated life of the family would have ended the morning after the car accident. The family would have been under investigation well before the incident at the school. The plot seems to be straight out of a late 19th century novel with too few modifications to fit a 21st century environment.",6,2,4,18 October 2018
