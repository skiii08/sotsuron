Moneyball," Wonderful, Inspiring Movie with great attention to detail
","I was very excited to watch this movie and was not let down the slightest bit. From beginning to end, it draws you into the factual story of Billy Beane. Jonah Hill plays a crucial part in the movie and was cast perfectly for this role. After doing a bit of research about Mr. Beane's life, it was interesting to see how close they stayed to the facts. The movie spells out the future of baseball and holds your attention from beginning to end. It's a little over two hours, but Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill keep you occupied the entire time! Generally when a story sticks this much to the facts, it tends to get more boring. I was not a baseball fan the first time I watched this movie, and the story was still written extremely well and delivered perfectly!",9,1,2,8 March 2014
Two for the Money," I loved this movie and thought it was very accurate
","From the opening scene, to the closing scene, this movie was setup perfectly. The cast was wonderful, and Matthew McConaughey was perfect for the leading role. Al Pachino is listed first, but 'John Anthony' is what makes the movie. If you have ever been a part of the betting world, there is nothing not to like about this movie. It shows the upside and the downside for both the businesses facilitating this type of behavior as well as how it impacts the individuals. Seeing the ups and downs that Matthew McConaughey experiences along the way will keep you on the edge of your seat wanting more. I was extremely pleased with this movie and the twists and things throughout will def keep you watching!",9,0,0,30 October 2013
Interstellar," Fantastic Movie With a Hint of Everything
","This movie starts off a little slow, but has to build up the characters for such an emotionally driven plot. Clearly from the title, if you are not into Sci-Fi, this movie is not for you. The nice thing to me is it is more of a reality based Sci-Fi. The casting for this movie could draw you in on it's own. The dept that Mathew McConaughey shows throughout the film is second to none. There are a few emotional, family scenes that will bring a tear to just about anyone's eye. Just by his performance alone, you are unable to not feel for the characters involved. Anne Hathaway plays the pivotal role beside McConaughey, and does not disappoint. Even Topher Grace from 70's show makes a good appearance.Throughout the film, they make great use of real life concepts. From Relativity to the processes that occur inside a black hole, a lot of information is factual and concise. Even if you feel like it is slow throughout, I highly recommend paying close attention and sticking around for the ending!!",9,0,2,1 December 2016
The Departed," Such an Amazing movie - can watch it many times
",The cast of this movie is second to none. And They don't disappoint with their acting either. Each is cast into a perfect role for them. I am not a fan of the Boston accents but the writing and plot of the movie is amazing. The whole way through you are trying to figure out what is going on and who is really good and bad. There are MULTIPLE twists at the end of the movie that you will not see coming. I cannot say enough for the amazing acting and to me it is more like reading a book then watching a movie. You are on the edge of your seat the entire time. I would highly recommend this movie if you are big into the whole Boston atmosphere and Irish as well!,9,1,2,7 November 2013
Draft Day," Excellent Movie for the sports lover and non sports lover alike
","A little about me: I am 30 and have been an avid NFL fan for about 20 years. I have never missed a game from my favorite team. With that being said, I'm surprised at home much my girlfriend related to the movie (she hates football)! I thought this movie did a wonderful job of meshing both the sports world and all of the pressures on these high paid executives with the challenges and problems they face in everyday life. To me, it helped you feel more like they were people as opposed to highly paid executives. I am no fan of Kevin Costner, but he did a great job in this movie. I always felt like his delivery and everything was weak and in a power position like the GM of the Cleveland Browns, I never thought that would work. But, he pulled it off. With that being said, I think there were much better people for the role.The storyline is very easy to follow, and while you think you would be able to predict the ending easily, it has some very nice twists. The main thing that I took away from this movie was that there is so much more to the life of a GM then making that pick. From other things on his mind, to keeping his job, it is a constant struggle.The storyline went from strictly being about the draft and preparation to the second half focusing on more of a love affair and family and how to juggle both. Excellent movie and highly recommended.",8,4,8,14 April 2014
