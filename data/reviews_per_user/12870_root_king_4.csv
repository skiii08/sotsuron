Lucky Number Slevin," Good movie
",Good movie with a very limited sense of space. Space in the movie. Considering its new york and people just cross each other more often than they should.,6,0,0,26 May 2020
Train to Busan," Amazing Zombie Film
",I think concept of Zombies is stupid and shallow. But i understand that it has an entertainment value. This is a great film about a pandemic. With just enough of Korean drama to keep you Captivated throughout the film. According to me it is a must watch for any film goer. I came across this film through Woo-sik Choi's Filmography and I am not disappointed.,8,0,2,12 April 2020
