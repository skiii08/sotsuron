Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," An excellent film for those with a thick skin
","This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. I have seldom laughed as often or as hard when watching any movie. The humor is inspired, subversive, and twisted.Spoilers to follow reveal specific gags in the movie.While this movie is funny, be warned that there is plenty in this movie that can offend people. This is probably the first movie to make a joke that combines anti semitism and the September 11 2001 terrorist attacks. The humor covers such topics as anti-semitism, mocking the mentally handicapped, incest, rape, a number of jokes targeted against women, the conservative US, religion, homosexuality, masturbation, and the people of Khazakstan.But if your likely to be OK with all of that, you will possibly hurt yourself laughing. The jokes push the clueless foreigner stereotype to extremes that I have not heard of in any other movie.END COMMUNICATION",10,2,15,4 November 2006
The Departed," A great crime movie.
","The Spoilers herein will pretty much give away the entire movie. Most of it can be inferred from the previews, but I will indeed wreck the ending for you.This is a movie that is very good, but is not one that I am not sure how well I liked it, which essentially means that its probably not one I would watch a second time.On the plus side, its has great acting, dialog, and very memorable characters. Damon and DiCaprio are both put in a very strong performance. And Jack Nicholson is very entertaining in his role, as is Mark Whalberg. The plot is interesting too. You have a mole in the police department trying to identify the under cover agent in the crime lords gang, while the agent in the gang tries to find the mole.But the story in and of its self is not that interesting to me, mostly because it feels like it does not really resolve its story line. By the end of the movie, all the principle characters end up dead, but there is not climactic gun fight. The undercover agent is very suddenly shot in the head, and then those who were in a position to expose the Mole are also shot dead. And then finally the Mole is in turn shot by one of the officers who quit the force when the Mole demanded access to the undercover agents in the wake of the death of the head of the under cover department. While the ending does fit the circumstances quite nicely, the is just not that satisfying and ending. Rather then resolving the character plot lines, everyone is just shot, and the truth is never really revealed. I would have preferred to see either the Mole or the Agent survive.Its hard to have a worthwhile ending, I think, when both the hero and the villain of the story end up dead and no one around them ends up knowing exactly why. I don't mind that the Mole gets killed at the end, but the ending would have been so much better if there were some on screen element explaining exactly why the ex-cop who killed him did so. For all the audience knows, he was murdered in cold blood out of a grudge having nothing to do with the central conflict of the story.END COMMUNICATION",8,1,2,24 October 2006
1408," An uncommon sort of horror movie
","There are plenty of horror movies that have come out recently, that rely on people being tortured in a gory and messy manner. Go back a bit further, and its easy to find all sorts of blood baths. It is much harder to find a movie that simply relies on tension and creating a sense of terror and unease.There is something very Lovecraftian about this movies approach. There is no monster, and no murderer. Just one 'very f*cking evil room', to quote the hotel manager. And once the clock starts to run, the main character is subjected to a relentless assault on his mind. This movie creates a palpable sense of malevolence and does so without an on screen villain.The movie is very entertaining without resorting to the same sort of tricks that most horror movies rely on, and for that alone it is well worth watching.",10,2,5,26 June 2007
