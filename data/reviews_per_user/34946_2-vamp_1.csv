The Ring," Gotta See This One
",This movie scared the Sh** outta me!  I had trouble going to sleep for the next week because my TV is exactly two feet from the foot of my bed. Kudos to the director and producers.  This film does not resort to the typical 'Gore' that one might expect with new horror releases.  It provides just the right amount of graphic details with two bodies for a mere two seconds and it more than does the trick!  The end will get ya!,10,0,0,24 October 2002
