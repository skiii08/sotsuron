The Blair Witch Project," This Project gets an A for effort, but it fails everywhere else
","I knew when I got to the theater that the movie I was about to see would be shot on video -- I got that much from magazine articles and commercials on TV.  What I wish I had considered was how much I hate watching other people's home movies.  That's the problem with this film (other than that pesky it's-just-not-scary thing): rather than making me feel like I was there with the actors, I felt like I was in someone's living room watching their home movies of an outing that gets creepy towards the end, but never delivers any legitimate scares.  Most of the film involves character development that is agonizingly slow and annoying to boot.  Believable, yes, but not interesting, entertaining, or worth watching.  Skip the Blair Witch Project.",1,0,2,30 July 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," My Main Problems
","I'd like to start by stating that I am not a Star Wars fan.  Thus, my views are incredibly biased and should not be given the same weight as a fan's views.  Also, I know that there is absolutely no excuse at all for not seeing this movie -- you just have to go.  You do not, however, have to like it -- and I really didn't.1 -- I loved the scenes with almost nothing but computer animation, like a few of the battles, but the computer-animated characters didn't blend with the real actors at all.  It's very visually painful to see a person walking in shadows next to a character whose very animation style requires that he have spotlights on him at all times.  I feel that remote control creatures would have been superior in many instances.2 -- Little Anakin Skywalker.  Yes, I know, I'm a horrible person for critiquing a little boy's acting style, and I know he'll probably turn out to be great one day, but he's not there yet.  The boy gives every single line in an 'Oh, wow' tone of voice, whether the line calls for it or not. It's something I truly believe he'll grow out of, but if the kid can't handle the lines yet, don't give them to him.  Let his mother give more of his background or let things come up in conversations between the two Jedi Knights.3 -- Once again, I'm a terrible, horrible person, but I absolutely loathed Jar Jar Binks.  I am far from a violent person, but after less than a minute of screen time, I wanted to tear the thing's ears off and walk out of the theater.  Maybe it's because I'm 18, but I found absolutely nothing redeeming about a character who skips along, spouting gibberish and doing incredibly annoying things, like eating random objects or sticking his head into energy beams.  I really hope he doesn't ever see a sequel...I realize that none of this will (or should) stop anyone from seeing the film, but I just couldn't idly stand by while it got unanimously rave reviews from everyone I know.Oh, and anyone who can recognize Natalie Portman will be completely unimpressed by one of the 'major' plot twists.",2,0,1,31 May 1999
The Game," Just not enough
","The Game is by no means a bad movie, but it isn't particularly good, either. Oh, I admit that it has some nice acting and intriguing plot twists, but the whole film has a very confusing feel (yes, I know that's on purpose, but that doesn't make it good).  The main reason I saw it was because I'd heard the 'huge shocker' ending would leave me breathless and make me want to watch it all over again.  While I won't spoil the end, I do need to say that it fell FAR short of my expectations.  It felt rather tagged-on, a disappointing end to a mediocre film.",8,0,1,16 April 1999
Mission: Impossible II," What a great summer movie!
","Wow.  This is what I think I've been expecting the Bond franchise to evolve into.  There's a damsel in some degree of distress (although she's quite plucky and can take care of herself most of the time, which I love), numerous gratuitous car chases (where the creators faithfully adhere to the law that any time a vehicle is struck while not currently being driven by the star, the vehicle must explode), fun gadgets, a pretty formidable bad guy, some great fight scenes...  Ah, it's awesome.  The plot is much simpler than the previous installment, but it's still got some elements that will likely confuse the crowd that kinda wants that.  It's got a nasty genetically-engineered virus, and there's even a part with Tom kind of giving a nod to fans who remember his scene from the first movie where he's suspended from a rope and must maintain his balance (of course, due to the nature of the sequel, this time the scene is even more action packed and audacious if not quite as intense).  Basically, this is just a caper movie with great technology and lots of explosions, which is what I think I wanted without knowing it.  There are no major life lessons, there's no uplifting love story... I kinda buy the Tom-Thandie chemistry a little, but mostly because I absolutely have to in order to really get the most out of the movie as a whole.  There's really no believable reason for these two to have any connection deeper than purely physical stuff, and once they are together, the chemistry doesn't really work for me.  But she is the Love Interest and as such does a great job, so I am content to nod my head at the screen, chuckle a little, and say, 'Yes, I know they're meant to be a great couple, Woo, thanks for the good try, now I'm ready for some more explosions,' and Woo of course provides them.  So anyway, I highly recommend this movie to bring out everyone's inner 8-year-old boy who still wants to see stuff blow up and stare in thankful amazement at the show.",10,2,4,24 May 2000
The Hurricane," Poor execution of a promising story
","After a couple of hours, this movie gets good.  It becomes a courtroom drama where the emotional parts become genuinely emotional.  The young boy doesn't get as many lines (which is good.  I'm sorry, but he just can't act), and maybe it's fatigue from being in my seat for so long, but the lines of dialogue that everyone else spouts become believable for the first time. Other than that, I can say very little in favor of The Hurricane.  The writers obviously killed perfectly good trees writing hours of dialogue for characters who will only be remembered as Good White Man 1 or Bad White Policeman 3.  Dan Hedaya does a decent job with what he's given, but every line amounts to 'Grr...  I don't like you because you're black.  By the way, have I mentioned lately that I'm evil and corrupt?  I'm afraid the guy asleep in the back row may not have picked up on it yet.'  The 3 Canadians have nothing to do but stand in a group like some obscene 3-headed beast, one being surly and dark (Liev Schrieber), one being the stereotypical pretty blonde, and the third being at times mildly accented and other times so British I honestly thought he was going to wrap himself in a British flag and dance around.  As expected, Denzel Washington does an incredible job, and he's helped by the fact that his lines are the only ones that sound like they were written by someone who has actually come into contact with people in the real world.  I mean, there are some really good lines ('You know, not all white people are racists.' 'Yeah, and not all black people are murderers.'), and some funny moments (they really don't warrant to more than a mild chuckle, but they're good attempts, and I'm really reaching for reasons to like this movie that is Socially Conscious and that everyone else will, as usual with Socially Conscious movies that ride the coat-tails of their capital letters, love and weep over and use as an excuse to pick a fight with me over my tastes in films), but I'm not someone who watches movies purely for the story being told.  For a movie to get to me, the story is just one factor.  I need something that is well done as well, something with good writing and good acting.  Aside from a couple of good lines and a great performance by Denzel Washington, this movie didn't have anything to like other than the emotional force of its story, and I'm truly sorry to be admitting this, but that's just not enough for me.  I can't recommend this movie.  I'm sorry.",5,2,4,16 January 2000
Psycho," Look at the movie as a whole
","Okay, I'll agree that the shower scene is one of the scariest in movie history.  Hitchcock did an amazing job with that.  Unfortunately, the rest of the movie doesn't measure up.  The scary start whimpers away into a movie of confusion that can only be described as creepy at best, dull at worst. It's a classic, but that doesn't mean it's good.",2,17,108,13 December 1998
Vanilla Sky," See it, but don't expect it to be good.
","I wouldn't say I liked it really, but I am glad I went and that I went before anyone could spoil it for me.  I think you should go, although I don't know that you'll like it, and I wouldn't go back with you, and I don't know that any of your friends will like it and I highly doubt that any of mine will, but I think you should go.  Things you will like: 
Penelope Cruz is, as always, absolutely adorable, and maybe, just maybe, this will finally be that promised film that rockets her to legitimate Hollywood stardom.  But most likely not because the rotten word of mouth from the masses will keep everyone away.Tom Cruise does a fantastic job playing a role that fits him well.Cameron Diaz is funny, desirable, unnerving, and sympathetic all at the same time.The twists and things are well explained by the end, although the one major clue doesn't happen until about two hours in.  Still, the clues along the way should give you some idea of what's going on, maybe.  The final explanation at the end is quite satisfying.Kurt Russell is good, especially at the end.There's a part where you as an audience member are specifically referenced, although it does fall rather flat.It is at times gleefully surreal, switching from dreams to reality with little warning.Things you will not like:It is at times dreadfully surreal, switching from dreams to reality with little warning.Bloated.  It's over two hours long for no good reason, lots of dead time when you're sitting in your seat trying to will the thing to move like it's a drowned kitten.  You know, maybe that's a good analogy for the movie.  It had some real potential to be a kitten everyone would love, but poor little Cameron Crowe gave it a bath for too long trying to get it all pretty and it just kinda drowned and it's a shame, but that's the way it works.Jason Lee is not at the top of his game, although he does seem to have taken efforts to pluck some of the unibrow.No one who sees it with you will get it.It's not nearly as clever as it (and we, really) would like to think it was supposed to be.The complete shift in gears an hour an a half into the movie is so jarring that it feels like you're trying to teach a teenager how to drive a stick -- mental whiplash is not a pretty thing, although they try to explain it away later.It's just not worth more than two hours of your time.  If it had been shaved to an hour and a half, maybe, if it had put more substantive material into its actual length, maybe, but as it stands it is not worth your time or money from the perspective of entertainment or life education. 
So if you're intrigued, go see it because nice people won't spoil it for you, but keep those expectations low and go alone.",4,0,0,14 December 2001
