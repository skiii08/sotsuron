Skyfall," Celebrating 50 years in service..
","Skyfall: You can see many action movies today...but if u go for a Bond movie...don't just expect action only..may be u would have seen that kind of Bond lately...here after a long time Bond comes as an agent down to earth..he shows he has emotions...u can feel the rusty old self of him who have still his childhood memories..Skyfall shows the common mistakes that could be made which could pay a price, psychopathic and techy geek villain who seeks revenge....and that legendary agent who loves his nation respects his boss and his life is his profession.Hats off to an excellent direction, brilliant casting and the clever scripting ...He is back celebrating 50 years in the service...he is the 007.",9,1,18,2 November 2012
Bohemian Rhapsody," Such a nostalgic watch!!
",Bohemian Rhapsody is such a nostalgic and a beautiful biopic of Freddie Mercury and the band Queen. Story is driven by the music and the exemplary performance of Rami Malek as Freddy. Gives the full feel which revolved around those generations and the ever living music.,9,6,8,16 November 2018
The Amazing Spider-Man," Have a different feeling ...
",This is my first review in IMDb.I went for this one today with little expectations mainly due to the change in cast as Garfield replaces Tobey.The main thing to be mentioned here is that this is a reboot of the Spiderman series.But changing all my doubts this one came out to be a great movie.This one had a change in its feeling.Spidey is more open now...the entirely different attitude of spidey made this fresh to watch.More of a comic book oriented story.There is more emotional content in here.Emma as Gwen is more real and smart.3D has its effects on certain scenes and was good.It is really a good entertainer which will give you a fresh feeling.,8,2,7,29 June 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Nolan does it again.........
","Went for this epic movie with full of expectations...mainly due to Nolan and all the hype......after watching it ,broke all my expectations..this is what we wanted and Nolan gave it to us.....the really amazing conclusion for an ultimate trilogy.The beginning of the film with all the actions and Bruce Wayne after 8 years of absence from Gotham made it so intriguing...but the rise of the villain to complete Ra's Al Ghul's destiny made dark knight rise once again.....with a very powerful villain batman goes through a very difficult time...all the small matters in the movie combines at last around the conclusion and makes us sit with awe and energy....really only a great director can do such a masterpiece,and Nolan deserves all the appreciation...a must watch....",10,3,8,20 July 2012
