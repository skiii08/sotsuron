Walk the Line," magic
",when i first read in rolling stone about this film being made and phoenix as the lead i hung my head and asked god 'why? why him? of all people why him?' flashbacks of the village and 8mm and a slew of others such as his role in Uturn which was awful came flooding back into my mind. Reese Witherspoon wasn't that bad after all who could argue with sound acting experience that is Legally blonde and legally blond 2...not to mention Overnight Delivery. But after hearing and seeing some clips and audio files i thought 'maybe they'll do the man in black some justice' they did more than that...they took that entire genre and perfected a movie about it. with great renditions of jerry lee lewis and Elvis and buddy holly i was blown away. i wanted to know and see more about those characters and people in that time period as well. but phoenix takes it and makes it his own his guitar playing style and charm and shear weirdness that was and is johnny cash was excellent. Witherspoon did a great job and redeemed herself. i was proud to have seen it and will probably be a repeat viewer. loved it,10,2,5,20 November 2005
Dawn of the Dead," surprising
","i have yet to see the original, so i don't have anything to compare it to, so this is probably going to change. i hate movies, where characters are stupid, like going back to check on her husband, even though its obvious he's the living dead. however it was fun being a smartass and yelling at the screen littering the dialogue with sarcasm and cynicism. i was exceptionally pleased with the slow version of 'get down with the sickness' and ving rhames was surprisingly strong. The pregnant lady and baby thing was pretty nasty, but i can see how this could become a cult classic very quickly. i am sure that some die hard fans of the original will call this crap, but we need remakes to give the newer generations a hint at what they missed, and what it took to get us here in today's cinema",6,0,0,19 December 2004
Elf," a great children's title
","i heard great things about this film, and expected to see goofy will farrell and giggle constantly, but was sadly disappointed. i only laughed out loud when he gets hit by the car. there were some other stuff that made me feel silly, but all in all this was a comedy, completely overrated by adults. don't get me wrong, i think it is a great film for children, and would take my own kids to it if i had any, but i heard college and high school kids telling me how funny it is, and i went into it with high expectations. my cynical self was p***ed that people mislead me, but i was pleased with the fact that as a children's movie, this is a very good film, but audiences need to grow up.",4,9,26,19 December 2004
