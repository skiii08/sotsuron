Insidious: Chapter 2," Even Better Than The First!
","I really, really enjoyed this film. I went to see the first one at the cinema when it came out, and enjoyed it, however, I did think that the last part of the film became a little unbelievable and far-fetched. I still sat at the cinema with a scarf over my eyes and my fingers in my ears, as it was still very scary and the storyline was good. In the second one, I do think part of the storyline is a little predictable (Josh not really being Josh), however the outcome of the story and the other things happening in the story are not predictable. I was sat on the edge of my seat the whole way through the film, (I did not have a scarf with me this time) but I sat with my fingers in my ears at the very loud bits as it is the noise that makes me jump. I could still hear what was going on though, and I must say that I think the soundtrack is great! The way they build up tension and suspense is very good as well, and even if you know that something is coming, it will still scare the living daylights out of you! The only criticism I have, is that I do not feel that the scenes from the past eg. 1986, were done very well. The acting was good however I still felt like we were watching a scene from the present time, as that is what it looked like. I didn't feel that the characters looked like they belonged in a different generation or that they were dressed from a different generation. I found the film a little confusing at times, but it all pieced together at the end. I would warn people, if you are easily disturbed then it is probably not the sort of film for you, but I really enjoyed it and was scared silly!",8,1,3,17 September 2013
