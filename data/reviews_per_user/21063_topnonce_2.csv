The Ring," One of the best horror films, ever
","OK, no spoilers here.This is one of the best horror films of all time, and I mean real horror films, not the 'Scream' variety where you jump a few times and go home.This is a real psychological white knuckle ride, with excellent music, surrealism, cinematography and great acting all helping to crank up the tension towards the unexpected ending.If you liked Blair Witch, this is similar but with about ten times the effect. It's not to everyones taste, but judge for yourself.For those who say it's like Sixth Sense, view the film on it's own merits, I found this a much better watch. If your expecting lots of gore and blood, it's also probably not for you.Enjoy it, it is an event in movie history.",Null,0,0,4 February 2003
The Deer Hunter," Doesn't age like a fine wine
","Well, this was one of the most critically acclaimed films of the 70s, but really doesn't stand the test of time. The acting is good but the dialogue flat and the plot disjointed and VERY drawn out.For a better VietNam film, try Apocalypse Now or Full Metal Jacket, for a better Christopher Walken film try The Dead Zone & for Robert DeNiro, try Taxi Driver or Godfather Pt 2.Watching this really made me realise how far things have come, and even rubbish films these days use good foundation film-making.",Null,0,1,20 February 2003
