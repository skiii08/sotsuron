Vertigo," my 'semi-professional take' on Vertigo.
","I just now looked at my video copy of Hichcocks 'Vertigo', and I must say that now at this long time after the 1958 release of the movie I am still 'blown away' by the movie, especially that very last/final scene which still 'packs a wallop', even after seeing it many many times!!!Of course, the main reason why it turned out to be such a high quality movie is because of the the caliber of the people who worked on the movie, from Alfred Hitchcock himself all of the way down to a common grip!!! I might say parenthetically that it is one of the greatest 'tragedies' to ever come out of Hollywood, that Hitchcock never actually won an Academy Award for Best Director!!Listen, does anyone out there know if Hitch had his usual brief cameo appearance at the start of the movie Vertigo or not, something he became well known for doing in some of his movies? Well, to sum up then, Vertigo will forever remain at the top of my personal 5-star movie list. If there is anyone who doesn't think that it was a great movie I would like to hear from them.",10,2,4,19 June 2005
