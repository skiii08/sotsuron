Hereditary," A bone shivering masterpiece
","I don't know from where should i start first. The directing is brilliant,ari aster skillfully creates a stifling atmosphere during the whole movie,the main events happen right on time as result of it you are not getting bored! In addition you always feel like something is going to happen in every scene change. The tense is so vibrant that makes you feel like there is something in your stomach all the time and the raw scenes which contains helps it even more. Now on the acting part.Gabriel Byrne is wonderful as always,shapiro is also exquisite even though she didn't have a big part but the real star is toni collete with her performance as woman that might suffers from a mental illness real misleads and twists the plot till the very end of the film.Her performance makes you feel discomfort,frightened and I'd also say sick because of how realistic it is. I've seen countless horror films something which have make me immune against jump scares and these kind of things.
Hereditary is a film that I've been waiting a long time for its release and it worth it,every minute of it.
The reviews I red where either height or depth but trust me it's a movie that you should see it's not an alternative,deep meaning,aronofsky style film.
I believe that the future of horror films are not the jump scares but the discomfortness that makes you feel and that movie made me feel this way the whole time.Hope you enjoy!",9,1,2,24 August 2018
