Deepwater Horizon," BP=Bad People
","This isn't about all the action and the performances, which by the way where great, Mark Wahlberg, Kurt Russell and all the other actors did a fantastic job, it's about much more, this was a disaster which should be a warning for all of us, 11 people died, think about their families a second, it destroyed nature and the life in it in the worst way possible, for what, for some greedy bastards who couldn't get enough and still can't get enough money and they got away with it....., well men haven't learned nothing until today, delusions of grandeur, we think we can take whatever we want, well I do believe the last word hasn't been pronounced yet, but it will be soon....and I think not in our favor,",7,0,0,11 January 2017
Fury," the show must go on!
","Boring, egocentric performance of brad pitt & co, surrounded by nice and helpful American soldiers, who would never rape a woman, oh no, they rather share an omelet together, never saw such a pathetic movie, brad command's, brad doe's and the rest jump, also into bed with one of the German girl, since he allow it, unrealistic from the beginning, they where 4 tanks, 3 of them got hit, not 'fury', well no, the show must go on, they where so good that we had to support another hour to watch this unbearable heroic finale, no really, I call this a 'horror-movie', nothing to do with War, it's just a mediocre production, forget it",2,4,9,30 March 2015
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Birdman suck's man!
","I'm actually a fan of Iñárritu, but this and on top of all an Oscar for Best Movie, well something wrong in Paradise! They tried so hard, me too by the way, I watched until the End, still don't get it. A chaotic mess between all these Characters, trying to make us understand that this is Satire, running on Broadway in underwear for instance?! The unexpected Virtue of Making Money and making a bunch of fool of us watching this crap! The Academy did her Job well and I do understand every Director leaving this 'Club' which is becoming more and more pathetic! There were so many fine pieces to choose, well the Oscar go's to a bunch of Ignorant, they really deserve it!",4,2,5,16 May 2015
Ben-Hur," You never get tired watching it
","This is simply my favorite Movie in every way, if you happen to read the Bible, than you understand the message, which is,as the Movie says (a Tale of Christ) the centerpiece of this Epic Work. You watch and cant stop wonder how they managed to create all the special effects at that time (1959), without PC's and all the kind of techniques we use today and still capture your attention from the very beginning, not to mention the music, what a magic, it's indescribably beautiful and deep, Charleston Heston, Stephen Boyd, Haya Harareet and all other actors made with their great performance this Masterpiece unforgettable, their journey through family, friendship, love, hatred, despair, suffering,revenge and finally peace, redemption and forgiveness is magical, as the Life of the Christ was and for those who believe, is, this was the first Movie I saw in theater years ago and no other ever touched me this way and we all know good Movies has been made since then, but still, this is beyond comprehension, if you are able to watch and believe in Christ with all your heart",10,17,24,29 December 2016
Unbroken," A fine piece of Work
","I must say, this movie was a surprise, a positive surprise, it felt like being with them, suffering, hoping, crying, a fine piece of work, she did really capture every moment past or present of Louis Zamperini's life, with sensitivity and subtlety, great performance of Jack O'Connell, Takamasa Ishihara, Domhnall Gleeson, cant' say anything negative, I just enjoyed the movie, it was captivating from the beginning, great choice of music as well, no honestly, she's a real good storyteller, if I may say so and got my full attention, it's the story about faith, struggle and forgiveness as well, so even if she didn't mentioned all of Louis Zamperini's life after he finally returning home, I believe we've got a great movie here",7,0,2,16 March 2015
Spectre," My Name is Zero = 00
","What a mess! It's like driving a great car with a flat tire, no speed no nothing. I always thought Daniel Craig was a bad choice playing Bond, he doesn't got the profile at all and this time I'm more than convinced. He can play any villain, but not Bond. This is probably the worst Bond of all time. No suspense, just driving a bit around, letting exploding here and there a building and of course, as a must as Bond, sleeping with all the female characters, what a performance. Fortunately the rest of the crew was more or less OK. We all learned a few letters of the alpabet such as M, C, and Q. Two and a half hour of pure senseless pursuit of I don't know what. Go fishing instead, there is more suspense and fun in it.",4,3,7,25 January 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," mad max is more than bad max!
","never watched anything so bad and senseless than this horror movie! no story, just a bunch of people, a part must have been escaped of 'apocalypto' before getting extinguished, chasing each other through a desert in fancy cars after some girls or for fuel or I don't know what, max, who's max, oh that's the guy who escaped Armageddon to rescue the poor girls, which had nothing to wear, it's all mixed up, their are scenes you think your are in the middle of 'the temple of doom', oh no, it's getting worst, let's not forget Furiosa, well i didn't actually knew that she can drive so good, amazing, well i have to stop writing, because it doesn't make more sense than the whole movie, what a mess, honestly, are you out of your mind, any crap is better than that! seriously guys, this ain't worth a star........oops, to late I already gave one......6 Oscars, well they are definitely out of their mind....well forget the Oscar's, they've gone mad, anything but this!",1,23,47,27 July 2015
