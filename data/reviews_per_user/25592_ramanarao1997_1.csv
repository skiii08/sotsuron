The Avengers," a must watch movie
","The graphics of the movie are amazing.IT includes many awesome scenes such as fighting,immense action scenes transforming of tony stark and hulk other themes of the movie are the attitude of tony,huge star cast,action packed scenes and many more.on the whole you get the pleasure of watching a nice movie and the time just passes by when you watch this movie.but the starting of the movie is somewhat dragging.when the characters come into play one by one the movie gets interesting.it also has some comedy scenes.it is the first movie to have more than 3 marvel characters.if you are a lover of visual effects you must definitely watch this movie!!!!!!!!!",9,8,12,17 April 2015
