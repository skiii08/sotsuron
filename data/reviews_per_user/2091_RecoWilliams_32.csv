Mission: Impossible III," What a Rush!
","From the very opening credits of this movie you are drawn in. The movie starts with a very intense scene in which you don't quite understand until the movie develops.Despite Tom Cruise off screen antics, his on screen performance is what you have come to expect out of him. Those glassy eyes really pull off this character.This ensemble cast really did a great job of telling and directing this complex story. One disappointment there is this object in the movie called the 'rabbit's foot' that you never learn what it is. I wish they would have given this object an identity.This movie had so many twists, just when you thought you had everything figured out the movie took another turn.This movie is a perfect action flick with a built in love story for the lady viewers.If you love hearing loud engines, blowing stuff up, jumping off of building, car chases, run sequences, and just mayhem and mischief this is the movie for you.If not I think Dreamworks has a new flick coming out soon! GO SEE THIS MOVIE!",8,0,1,9 May 2006
The Longest Yard," A Great Remake!
","This adaptation was great. It was awesome that Burt Reynolds was part of the cast as well.If you are looking for a reason to see this movie just let me say: Adam Sandler and Chris Rock! This is their first movie together.This movie had it all. It was funny, it had hard hitting sports sequences. This movie will definitely go in my DVD collection when it comes out.The plot is similar to the original movie, but they made a lot of changes to make it more modern and since Burt Reynolds was in the movie he apparently approved.This movie is a great movie, their is a little language in the movie so if you have sensitive ears, be prepared. But it was funny to me.The most surprising to me was Nelly. He is actually a great natural actor. I definitely think he has the potential to the next Will Smith. He has the acting skills down much earlier in his career than Will did. The ladies love him, guys adore him! Oh, that's L.L. Cool J. But you know what I mean.Go and see this movie I haven't laughed this hard in a movie in a while so check this movie out. I've read a lot of reviews here on IMDb and they are really hating on this movie, I think they missed the demographic in which this movie was targeted. It is an MTV production, don't forget that. If you are not a MTV person, then the movie ideally wasn't targeted for you. But if you are not a MTV person and you like to have little fun at the box office then this is by far the best choice for all of the comedy movies currently playing. And next to Star Wars EIII this is your best bet for a great time at the movies!",8,0,2,2 June 2005
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Look out Potter!
","Disney has finally tapped into the other family market, Christian films.C.S. Lewis classic masterpiece has been beautifully turned into a movie. This movie has everything you expect from Disney, great direction, great special effects, and a great actors.The first in the series, The Lion The Witch and the Wardrobe, was an excellent adaptation.I took my niece who had never heard about the books, when she finished watching the movie she went and bought the whole set of books! This movie will inspire a whole new generation in the same way of Potter, and Rings.This franchise will be a force to reckon with.If you are looking for a good family movie with a whole lot of bang for your buck then this is the movie for you!",9,4,5,2 January 2006
Spider-Man 2," Spider-Man The Franchise
","Spider-Man 2 is an awesome movie. This movie has all the elements of a major Summer Blockbuster plus one more thing: A GOOD PLOT!I was really impressed at the depth of this plot. This second Spider Man movie really developed the character of Peter Parker. Peter Parker is just an ordinary kid who was blessed with supernatural power. The now famous line from SpiderMan is 'With great power comes great responsibility' This movie dwells into why their is such a great responsibility.I really believe that with writing and special effects that the SpiderMan franchise is set for years. I expect at least 3 more movies with huge opening generating a need for a next movie.It is hard to write an in-depth review of this movie without giving away the plot, so I will not.If you like the SpiderMan T.V. show, comic book, or SpiderMan the movie part one you will love this movie. Go and see this movie and hey adults it's not just for the kids.I give this movie a 9 out of 10!Spider Man, Spider Man who does whatever a Spider can!",9,0,0,30 June 2004
Constantine," Heaven vs. Hell vs. Constantine
",This was a good movie. I was wondering could Keanu Reeves break the mold of 'Neo' his steady Matrix character. But I think he did a good job in this movie.The script kinda reminds you of 'The Prophecy' but Constantine does has it's own unique identity.This movie makes you really think about what's REALLY going on in the spirit realm everyday that we cannot see. If you are a 'religious' person you will understand the subtleties made in this movie to generate fear.This is a good movie. It's not one of the best movies but it is worth watch. So go out and see it.(And yes I do give bad reviews: King's ransom) I've become such a good judge of Theatrical Trailers I tend to know which movies to waste my money on.,6,1,6,26 April 2005
Troy," Hector of Troy
","Troy was an awesome production. Eric Bana and Brad Pitt really shine in this movie. The plot was a little slow at points. And some of the jokes in the movie require a knowledge of greek history, but other than that it is a great film.It is amazing the length man will go through for a woman. Helen of the Queen of Sparta who later becomes Helen of Princess Troy the name change is the catalyis of this movie.Paris and Hector the princes of Troy are now faced with war, simply because Paris was in 'love' with Helen.The battle scenes in this movie were great.  In a movie about Greek History you would expect to see a least a sampling of the power of the God's, but it never came.Eric Bana and Brad Pitt will probally both be nominated oscars, as they should. This is a great movie a lot of fighting a lot of blood and lot of just good movie watching. Ha haGo and see this movie you will enjoy. Word to wise do some research if you are ignorant to the story of Troy.",8,1,2,24 May 2004
Crash," A movie full of Oscar worthy performances!
","This movie is an awesome journey. It is amazing that in the year 2005 that our racial harmony is still not where it should be. Crash takes you on a journey through the lives of multiple characters interwoven together by similar events. This movie has the feel of Magnolia by Tom Cruise which was so well done.The ensemble cast in this movie was awesome. Each played their part bigger than the movie itself. From the very opening credits of this movie you are drawn into the world of this movie. Most importantly for me you care about the characters. Some of the characters were a little underdeveloped, because of the complexity of the plot, but what you lack in development you more than make-up in implied backstory.If you didn't know this movie deals with race relations. It was interesting to watch this movie in an audience that was diverse. Some of the more prevalent stereotypes in our society was explored. They were not explored in an ABC after school special way, it was explored with very graphic imargery and language. It is a reason this movie garnered an R rating. I really feel that the language used in this movie was needed, to understand the depth of the issues dealt with. Many of my Christian readers will be offended by this language and a brief sex scene, but I think you should go see the movie anyway, because the story is bigger than that. Remember the Passion got an R rating too! This is best movie of 2005 to date. I would have given it a 10 rating, but I didn't want to eat that if something greater came out this year. But this is a remarkable film that I feel every one should see. This movie will make you think twice about your own life and whether or not you are making unjust stereotypes on another race or even your own race.M.L.K. dream is still not complete and this movie helps to show us how we can make it happen. Go Crash into your favorite theatre to see this movie.I give this movie a 10, because it will go down in cinematic history! And it will win an Oscar!",10,1,12,12 May 2005
The Devil Wears Prada," The Devil wears an Oscar
","I went to go see this movie, because I though the way they marketed this with the theatrical trailer was genius. If any of you have been to the movie theatres in the past two months you have seen the trailer for this movie and thought you walked in on the wrong movie, because the trailer is the opening sequence of the movie, which I thought was such genius marketing strategy! So here's my review, if that trailer peaked your curiosity then you should see the movie. The movie is slick, fast paced, view of the deep dark side of the fashion industry.Ms. Streep gives a performance which was incredible. She WILL BE nominated for supporting actress nomination, or the academy is a joke.Anne Hatheway with her big eyes did a great job of playing the budding new assistant who has to fit into a dark world of fashion. Her transformation in this movie is really good. This is much better than her princess diaries role, although similar.My girlfriend enjoyed all of the brand names of clothes featuring in the movie, which I'm don't have that big of an eye for. But every scene she was like 'I want that'. So I think the costume people did a great job in that respect to make a movie two years ago that is still fashionably hip today.I enjoyed this movie. It's not one of those movies that will go down in history, but Ms. Streep's performance will!",8,2,4,11 July 2006
The Village," It aint' what you think it is
","I have mixed reviews about this movie. I liked it and I hated it. Let me explain.I really hated, because it isn't what I thought it was. I expecting it to be like all of the other M. Night movies, but this was in a different category all together. I should have known something was different when they used his other movies to promote this one.Now with that being said, if you can go to the theatre now and forget everything you know about M. Night's movies then you really enjoy it.This was an awesome period piece with a whole lot of symobollism. I thought it was well directed and well acted. In retrospect, when you figure out the suprise twist, you realize exactly what makes this movie so powerful.M. Night has the ability to completly draw you into the worlds in his movies. No one, whether they hated it or liked, can say they were not curious to find out what type of thing resided in those woods and what kept those people alive for all of those years.It's a really good movie, it just want be if you compare it to his other movies. I think they made a really bad marketing strategy to use his other movies to promote this one. It is going to make it really hard on M. Night fans to beleive any more promotions.Go and see this movie. It's always good to see movies that get mixed reviews.I give it 8 if I didn't know M. Night directed it. I give it 5, since I knew he did.",5,0,0,31 August 2004
"I, Robot"," Will Smith is still the king of Summer Blockbusters!
","This movie is a loose adaptation of the short story 'I Robot'. This blockbuster is exactly that, a summer blockbuster.The plot in this movie dragged along at time, but the overall movie when balanced out with special effects makes the slow plot bearable.I enjoyed this movie. The idea of programming robots with the '3 Laws' was genius.  Their adherence to these laws forces the actions of this movie. 
I don't want to give away any of the movie, but beleive you me, it is worth watching.I will give this movie an 8 out of 10. Which is pretty high for a movie like this versuses some of my other 9 and 10 movies. But I am only ranking this movie against other summer blockbusters.",8,0,0,17 July 2004
The Alamo," Remember the Alamo!
",Remember the Alamo are the famous lines shouted by Sam Houston as he goes up against Santa Anna's army.This movie was very good. The special effects are so real. You feel as if you were at the actual Alamo.One thing in this movie stood out above anything else: Billy Bob Thorton. Billy Bob played an excellent Davey Crockett. I beleive that this performance will gain him an Academy Award nomination.This is one of the best peformances that I have ever seen from Billy Bob.With that being said the rest of the movie is simply average. The plot drags in places. Some of the characters were never fully developed and basically it required the watcher to do research before seeing this movie to trully understand it.If you are not from Texas or if you are not familiar with the history of the Alamo then I suggest you look up some stuff before going.I learned a lot from watching the movie and those guys were just DUMB. I don't know if I have this pride in my country.,9,6,8,4 May 2004
Van Helsing," Van Helsing meets Dracula meets Wolfman meets EVERYBODY!
","I have mixed feelings about this movie.  On one hand it was cool seeing all of those characters put together in one movie. But also think that was the thing the hurt the movie the most.This movie is a good set-up for a series of movies. And If I know Hollywood there will at least be a part two to this big budget action pictures. 
Okay back to my review. This movie was good for what it was. The vampire brides were sexy. HOT!  The action scenes were good. I was glad that didn't go for the whole Matrix special effects thing. It was a good use of wires and explosions in this movie.I give this movie a 6. This is the first time that I have been stumped on reviewing a movie.  Go see it and you tell me what you thought!Ha ha",6,0,1,25 May 2004
Jarhead," Jar Head The movie
","First of all I would not recommend anyone under the age of 18 to see this movie. The language and images in this movie is very harsh. Now with my disclaimer out of the way.This is a very good movie. This movie takes you on the side of war that many do not get to see. This movie is very gritty and very raw. It deals with the first gulf war and all the mental preparation it took for this type of scenario.Jamie Foxx does an excellent job in this film. It's not Oscar Worthy but is a character that you would not expect to see Mr. Foxx playing.The casting of this movie was absolutely great. I enjoyed this movie, but it seemed to drag on sometimes bogged down in little details. I guess I should have read the book.The movie is a little above average, but it's not a contender in the movies in 2005 that I have seen thus far.I would say go see it, but if you think of another movie you would like to see first, then see that movie and then come back and watch Jarrad.",7,0,0,12 November 2005
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Harry Potter and The Prisoner of ME!
","I must say I expect a lot from the third installment of the Harry Potter franchise. One thing that concerned me before I went that critics who gave HP1 and HP2 low ratings were now giving HP3 raving reviews.(To all of you Die Hard Harry Potter fans I warn you in advance that this review may be disturbing to your spirit) :)After seeing the movie I must say I was a little disappointed. I know that focus of this movie was a little more darker and now the kids of the movie were now going through puberty but this movie lacks something. First of all it was not as light as the first two movies. Even in scenes were the kids were simply having fun the movie was two dark. But I say it was too dark, because they went for the PG-13 rating (for the kids) instead of making it the fun loving Horror movie that this installment was crying out for.Another thing that concerned me was that J.K.R. gave this movie the thumbs up. Is she not as brilliant as we once assumed. Because as I writer I would have fough harder for the essence of the book to show through in this book.The absolute best thing about this movie was the justaposition of Harry dealing with his own personal demons (Dementors). This movie will do well, because HP has such a huge cult following. But one more movie like this and the HP fans will simply be nerds like the obsessed Stars Wars, Lord of the Rings, and Star Trek fans. God forbid that happens. This was the first franchise movie in a while that had a young and old multiracial following, but I felt that was neglected in this movie.I was honestly bored throughout parts of this movie. Oh my GOD they could have shelled out money for a good score. My little brother could have a better score with his 32 key keyboard. It's not liek they don't have the money. I've heard that this new director won 't be a part of HP4 so hopefully the new director doensn't choose to follow in his footsteps because of th critial acclaim.I give this movie a 6 out of 10. I gave HP1 and HP2 a 9.'The movie critic who still pays admission'",6,0,0,1 July 2004
Batman Begins," BatMan is Brand New!
","Batman begins is an awesome new start to the Batman franchise. This film was by no means campy and kid friendly. This movie spoke to true heart of the Batman story.As many of you know from comic books, cartoons, movies, or the t.v. show that Batman's parents were killed by a thief and that Bruce Wayne always blamed himself for that. Batman begins offers the best explanation of how he went from being just Bruce Wayne to becoming Batman.This movie had everything. It had a slight love story, action sequences, suspense, and even a couple of scary moments. The imagery in this film is far superior to any of the other previous Batman movies.After seeing this film, I can't wait until they start making sequels. This new DC Comics authorized version of Batman is going to be huge. If you haven't seen go get a babysitter and check it out. Because this movie is truly not meant for anyone under 13.",9,0,0,27 June 2005
X-Men: The Last Stand," The best of the trilogy
","X3 really lived up to all of the hype. This movie was darker and more slick. I love the intricate story line in this one.If you haven't seen the first two, this movie really does a good job of standing alone as it's own movie.I was so shocked with some of the developments in the movie. I'm not a true comic book fan, so it's a couple of things that happen in the movie that are really going to take you off guard.They call it 'The Last Stand' for a reason.This movie was good from beginning to end, a rare find in a big budget film like this, but it was actually a pretty good piece of cinema.Even Kelsey Grammar kicks butt as Beast.Go see this movie it was absolutely a good movie!",9,2,4,5 June 2006
Across the Universe," Take me Across the Universe
","Imagine if you will Moulin Rouge meeting the Beatles. This is the best way to describe the effect of this movie. Acoss the Universe is a movie written totally around Beatle's song lyrics. That in itself was a hard feat, but to make the songs tell a complete story was another challenge.The movie was genius in so many ways. I initially didn't expect to like the movie very much because the previews seem a bit odd. Then we had such a hard time trying to find the movie, because it didn't release nationwide until a few weeks later, then I finally got to see it.The music clearly drives the movie. Don't worry, if you are not a hard core beatles fan, which I am not, you will still love the music. I was really impressed with the new arrangement of some of the songs. The cast was absolutely amazing. Their voices were so impressive. This is a good movie. But what I have discovered from my students and my friends is that you are going to love it or hate it...not many people in the middle. I wonder where you are going to be?",10,0,2,30 October 2007
Transformers," More than Meets the Eye
","Well, i grew up watching the Transformers cartoon after school everyday. So I was familiar with all of the characters and I knew all of the back story.The movie did a horrible job of setting up new fans on the complete story of Transformers, but I know sequels will be made and more transformer revelations will be made then.Before I start my review do you even remember the theme song for transformers. Sure you all know this part 'Transformers More than meets the eye Transformers Robots in Disguise'But there is an actually an entire song by a group called Lion. So for those that are mad that I gave the movie a 7, if you don't know as much about transformers than I do, you get a juice box stick a straw in it and suck it!Tranformers the movie is really amazing. I was blown away by how much CG effect has grown through the years. The robots fighting in the downtown shots were worth the price of admission. Many guys will like the movie for the action shot, hot cars, robots, and Megan Fox. It's one of the movie that I know both girls and guys will like, whether or not they know anything about Transformers. When they leave the movie they will be fans.The movie did drag in several places, but overall it was good. So let me know what you think. The last movie critic who still pays the price of admission.",7,0,1,1 November 2007
Million Dollar Baby," Okay I saw this one Late
","I must admit I went to see this movie the day after the Oscars. I thought that it may be a good movie, but seeing it win all those awards made me want to see it.O.k. probably being the last of you to see this movie then you already know this is agreat movie. With a extremely well written script. Clint Eastwood did an awesome job directing and playing the lead male role in this film.This is much more than just a boxing film. This is a movie about the human condition. And one woman's journey to never give up at all costs.This movie will be a great movie to add to your collection and undoubtedly it will go down as one of the greatest movies of all time.Yeah folks I said of all times, it's just that good.If you haven't seen it you are doing yourself a disservice so go and see it today!",9,2,3,26 April 2005
The Descent," Girls in a cave
","I gotta say I'm not a fan of horror movies, because they are normally so comical in their set-up. But the Descent gives you more. It actually gives you characters you care about.Everyone could kind of imagine the scenario that will lead these thrill seeking women into a cave. But there's a twist, which I won't ruin.This movie was incredible. It had so many shockers and most importantly you get to scream on the people on the screen in their sheer ignorance. It's what a horror movie should be.I would highly recommend this flick to everyone. This is the type of horror movie you would watch over and over again on DVD with your friends.",8,3,7,2 September 2006
Inside Man," The Inside Man
","This movie was very slick. I was so shocked to see Spike Lee make a film like this. Before now I was really only a fan of Spike Lee's Malcolm 'X' which also starred Denzell Washington.This is an extremely brilliant suspense thriller. From the opening credits you are drawn into this movie. There are plot twists in this movie that was totally unexpected.I was torn with the ending of this movie. Any great movie suppose to leave you wanting more, but there was so much more of this story that could have been resolved. My friend that saw the movie up until she saw the ending she thought it was great movie.I must admit the ending was a little anti-climatic, but I think it served it purpose.I have to go watch this one again to see all of the hidden symbolism I read about in the blogs.This is the best Spike Lee movie ever! If you are a fan of his, you will be pleasantly surprised. Good film.",8,1,1,30 March 2006
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Harry Potter 4 (The Goblet of Fire)
","This movie is incredible!From the very onset of this movie it had a much different feel than all of the other movies. For those of you who keep up with my reviews I was not a big fan of HP3! I loved HP1 and HP2 but HP3 was lacking.WELL I'm back on the HP bus again. This fourth installment was absolutely brilliant. I loved the fact that we are growing up with the characters. Dan Radcliffe (harry) is now a teenager. Now that the movie is going into that territory and there will be no shortage of Harry Potter movies in the future I loved that they dealt with them simply growing up.They with a number of coming of age things like getting a date, loyalty amongst friends, and awkward sexual tension. Hey it's in there! This movie was almost three hours long, but I loved every second of it. This movie is centered around a Tri-Wizard Competition which in and of itself was remarkable.Harry is forced to grow up in this movie. I loved how the movie showed that Harry may be great, but he still needs help from time to time. It was awesome being in the movie looking around at all of the under 13 kids who seemed terrified by the dark imagery in this movie. I know this movie will be another record breaker!This is hands down the best of the franchise since HP1 and this is a nice restart for the franchise. I loved this movie and I would've given it a 10 except for it drags on some places.As many of you who read my reviews I tried not to expose any plot points so go and see this movie, it's a good one!",8,0,1,20 November 2005
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," This movie rocks!
","I totally forgot to review this movie. I saw this movie opening weekend and I totally let it slip and one of my avid readers (thanks Justin) reminded me that I haven't reviewed it! So on with the review...Mr. and Mrs. Smith was an incredible movie. From the very opening credits you are drawn into the world of this movie.Two secret agents who are married to each other, but don't realize that their spouse is a secret agent was just a genius script. The thing is their marriage lacks passion because the other one is just trying to play the role of a normal spouse.But that all blows up in their face when they are out on the same case one day.The banter between Brad and Angeglina was just perfect. You could totally believe that they were the characters they were playing. This movie was well directed and the action sequences are incredible.I love the number of close up shots in the middle of the action sequences that let you know that Brad and Angelina did a lot of their stunts.This movie was much better than I anticipated and I recommend it for all to see. This movie ooses with passion and you are in it with them until the very last second of the movie. I hope they make a sequel.",8,0,2,4 August 2005
War of the Worlds," Some movies are not better as remakes
","When I found out Steven Spielberg was on board to make a modern adaption of War of the Worlds like many of you I was stoked. This movie had all of the best Spielberg: Top notch actors, incredible special effects, and great lighting. You know all the good stuff you can learn to expect from him.But the pace and plot of this remake was a little bit undesirable. The movie had an incredible intensity to it, that really pulls you into the movie, but that's where the movie falls short.I guess it's hard in a post 9/11 society to view disaster in a such a personal way.There are some great moments and a lot of good quotes from this movie. I don't know if this movie is awesome, or if I'm just disappointed since it was a Spielberg flick that it wasn't better. I'm on the fence here.I would recommend that you go and see this movie, because it is a GOOD movie. It's not going to go down in history like E.T., but it will be remembered.Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning were a perfect casting for the father and daughter parts. You see a new depth to Tom Cruise's acting ability in this movie. And for those of you who have been following Dakota...she's great as usual. It's about time she wins an Academy Award. How many good movies must she make before she gets her respect as a child actor. She is clearly the best Actor under 18 hands down! Go see War of the World and email me YOUR review!",7,1,3,27 July 2005
American Gangster," It feels good to be a Gangster!
","Like many of you I have been disappointed by the movies released so far this year. There have been very few Oscar Contenders and more than that there have been very few movies that will draw people out. I have loved the Game Plan, Across the Universe, Kingdom, Things We Lost in the Fire, Transformers and a few others. But that's a very short list consider about 10 movies come out every single week and it's November.American Gangser has filled a void that I think many cinema goers were missing. The fact that this movie was based on a true story, a plus. The fact that Denzell and Russell meet again after 11 years when they appeared together in Virtuosity, a plus. Back then Crowe was the bad guy and Washington was the good guy. And if you remember that movie, it wasn't good. The fact that American Gangster is directed by Ridley Scott, a plus.The movie draws you in from the very beginning. If you were like you me you were already sold by the trailers. But the fact that this was based on a true story, drew me into the story even further.Washington plays Frank Lucas, a real life American gangster, who takes over organized crime in New York City. His rise to success is simple he uses the formula that any successful corporation uses: 'Cut out the middle man' That revelation was given to him by his mentor 'Bumpy' who died in a franchise store while talking about how he misses the middle man. Kinda ironic of how Frank Lucas took over.At the same time you have Crowe who plays Richie Roberts, a cop who is trying to fight corruption in the police force. The movie took an approach of where you follow Frank Lucas and care about him and at the same time you follow Richie Roberts and you care about him.It's kinda odd because you are rooting for both sides. Richie Roberts is a goodie two shoe cop who does everything the right way. Frank Lucas is a ruthless crime boss who wants to do what he cans to help his family.The movie is filmed in a gritty and raw New York/New Jersey. The back drop of the Vietnman war and the American soldiers addiction to narcotics really hit home. It was like a juxtaposition our soldiers are fighting for freedom in a place that is enslaving them with drugs. And not only that they were sending that bondage back home.American Gangster will not be a Scarface or a Godfather, but what makes American Gangster stand alone is that it's just a street story. This movie shows you how easy it is to get caught up on the wrong side and not even realize that you are there.Crowe and Washington will both probably get Oscar nominations for this film, and I think they expect it with the November release.Go see this movie. I must say Hollywood is getting it right. First 'Kingdom' then 'Across the Universe', then 'Things we Lost in the Fire' and now 'American Gangster.' 2007 has a shot of not being the worse movie year ever in history.American Gangster will develop a cult following and I fear it spawn a whole new generation of American Gangsters.I give this movie a 10 out of 10. The only thing I wish they would have done differently, but I'm sure this will be on the DVD is to show the real life Roberts and Lucas who were consultants on the film. 'The movie critic who still pays the price of admission' Go see this film!",10,1,9,3 November 2007
Hitch," Will and Kevin a great match.
","Is Will Smith capable of making bad movies. This is one of his great movies. This is the first time he has ever starred as the lead of a romantic comedy.Kevin James is hilarious in this movie after seeing the movie I must admit I started watching his T.V. show 'King of Queens' more.This is a very well done plot. Actually being able to have a date doctor is something all men can appreciate it. I think learning the process of what drove Will Smith's character to that profession was great itself.This movie does not take the paths you expect a romantic comedy to take. I love the fact that they take a lot of risks in the plot and in the timing of some of the jokes. This is a great movie.I will forever be a Will Smith fan I guess. Well at least until he makes 2 or 3 bad movie in a row. But right now he still remains king of the summer box office and he's not doing so bad in the Winter either. 'Ali and Hitch' not bad company.I would go see this movie with a date, it makes a great conversation starter.",9,2,4,26 April 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," So we've finally made it to the middle of the movie!
","Episode III is hands down the best of the episode series. This movie actually felt like Star Wars. The other two felt kinda kiddish. But this one had all of the fights and in space flying sequences that you have grown to expect from all of the other Star Wars movies.I am by no means a huge Star Wars fan, like the millions of you who couldn't wait to see it the first day. It was a great movie. And it is so far one of the best summer movies.So coming from a non Star Wars fan it was a great movie. I would start with this one and go watch the original Star Wars movies and skip episode one and two, because they are not very good anyway. Sorry Star Wars fans!",8,1,6,2 June 2005
Ray," GEORGIA ON MY MIND
","This movie was excellent. It was a nice to see a biopic movie with so much heart and soul. I must saying know that Ray Charles helped with the production of this movie before he died gives a sense of realism.He annointed Jamie Foxx as the person to play him in this movie. And for those of you who may not be Jamie Foxx fans, he really became this character. When watching this movie you see Ray Charles you do not see Jamie Foxx.This movie is beautifully directed. The way the director showed how Ray dealt with his blindness as a child was absolutely incredible. The lady who played Ray Charle's mother had an awesome performance in this movie. Without a doubt Jamie Foxx just became the forerunner for the Oscar nomination this year. There is just so much passion in this film.I don't want to give you any tidbits about the movie. If you enjoyed the trailers you will enjoy this movie.This is a must-see film that I think everyone will appreciate. The only thing I hated about this movie was that it ended.",10,1,3,9 November 2004
Fantastic Four," This movie is Fantastic
","I was not an avid reader of the Fantastic Four comic book, but I was familiar with all of the characters. With that being said, let me review this movie.This movie is awesome. They spent a whole lot of time building why the characters are the way they are. They clearly anticipate on making this a franchise movie with at least 2 sequels. I think they did an excellent job of setting up a franchise flick worthy of the Spider Man and X-Men counterparts before it. DC Comics really did a number with overseeing this project. That's probably why it is so good.The cast was absolutely perfect. I can't think of a better casting for this movie. This movie has everything you expect from a comic book movie. Special effects, witty rapport, fast pace camera shots, and a whole lot of stuff blowing up! That's sounds like a hit to me.What's so amazing about this movie is in like Spiderman 1 you see how they got there super powers. I think this was best to start from the beginning like this so you can build a whole new following around the F4 movies. I can't wait for the sequel.This is clearly one of the best movies in the Summer Box Office of 2005. This is a good fun rock em and sock em movie.Ladies don't rule this movie out yet. There is a complex love story going on in this movie which I think you will totally relate with. Guys this will make a good date movie.Go and see this movie. The only bad thing I have to say about this movie was that it ended! But from what I've learned from Screenplays that is the desired result!",8,0,1,27 July 2005
The Bourne Supremacy," Six Flags over Bourne
","I loved the plot and script of this movie. But the direction was absolutely horrible. Paul Grengrass, the director, had a vision that did not fit with this movie.It feel like riding a wooden roller coaster. There were two many out of focus hand held shots. I think that this absolutely tainted the purity of this film.  At times you would almost want to leave and go and watch something else, because the direction is so bad.  At key moments in the movie where the director could have chosen to use all of these fast cuts, jerky, out of focus shots. He didn't. Where like in more intimate moments he completely ruined them with his idea of direction.OKAY NOW THAT I HAVE FINISHED BAD MOUTHING THE DIRECTORThis movie is awesome. If you are familiar with the books or with the 'The Bourne Idenity' you will enjoy this movie. The character of Bourne was played superbly by Matt Damon. This movie shows that even a ruthless killer has a heart.On the scale of 1-10. I have mixed reviews Acting 9 Writing 9 Direction 2 Which gives  the movie a 6 but you understand my logic now.Could have been a 9 all the way around minus about 100 hand held shaky shots.It was as if Muhammed Ali filmed this movie with a Handy Cam. Yes, the shots are that bad!",6,0,1,26 July 2004
Hustle & Flow," It's hard out here...
","This movie definitely was not intended for immature audiences. This movie is rate R for a reason. Now that I got my kiddie disclaimer out of the way.This was one of the most interesting movies that have since 'Crash'. This movie takes you into the harsh side of the world of hip hop. So many people live lives thinking they will make it big. For others the only option they have to survive is to make it big.In this movie hustle and flow you see the struggle the main character, Dee Jay, takes as he sees a way out through music. As a small time pimp and drug dealer he is simply tired of hustling.This movie pulls you into it's world. It's not a world that many I know would ever be involved in, but it was like looking at a documentary of the next big hip hop star. I was amazed. Visually this movie is just astounding. The camera angles and shots chose. The pace of the movie, everything was absolutely perfect.I am predicting Terrence Howard to get nominated for an Oscar because of his strong performance in this movie as well as his supporting role in Crash. The combination of these two great movies should have him with at least one nomination. It's amazing he's in both of my top two movies of 2005.Keep them coming Terrence! He also has an HBO movie that came out this year called Lackawanna Blues it's an interesting movie based off a stage play. If you can find it watch it! Hustle and Flow is one of the most unique movies made this year! Definitely if you are over 18 and can bear through hearing language you don't speak yourself, then go watch this movie.",9,0,0,19 September 2005
Dodgeball," Finally Ben Stiller makes another good movie.
","Like many of you I was so upset with Ben Stiller in Envy, but I decided to give him one more chance. And I am so glad that I did. So to all of you Ben Stiller fans I have just two and half words for you: He's Back. (half of word because of the contraction) O.k. back to the review.It has been a long time since I've seen a movie that I laughed aloud at the movie theatre like. I will have to say all the way back to Dumb & Dumber. But DodgeBall is one of those movies. This movie will probally develop a huge cult following.The characters in this movie are hillarious. This movie had a retro feel with new age jokes. It was genius. I haven't laughed as hard in a long time. The plot has a couple of issues, but hey it's a Comedy not an Academy Award nominee. This is a great movie.  I give it 8 out of 10. Go and see this film! Anybody up for a game of Dodgeball?",8,0,0,30 June 2004
