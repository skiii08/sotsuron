The Equalizer," Another Hit By the Denzel Washington/Antoine Fuqua Dynamic Duo
","The Equalizer is the latest film by acclaimed director Antoine Fuqua. Now, I feel a little embarrassed not knowing this director's name by heart because he has quite a few very respectable films under his belt. If you also do not recognize the name of this extremely talented director let me shed a little light. This guy is responsible for Training Day, Tears of the Sun, King Arthur, and of course the movie in discussion. The Equalizer satisfies in all the ways his other great films do but the directing talent is just one factor that makes this movie so great.A movie can have a superb story, amazing cinematography, and mesmerizing writing as well as directing, but without the talent to deliver it all, it finds itself lacking. This is where the gifted cast comes in, notably the star of this film, Denzel Washington. Denzel Washington is so talented he just makes almost every film he touches a hit. His performance in The Equalizer is no exception. I often think about these great veteran actors and actresses who just refuse to pass their prime. A lot of these performers are getting a little seasoned and makes me wonder if they can still pull off a great movie, especially an action one. Actors like Liam Neeson, Sylvester Stallone, and Bruce Willis are some to name a few. However, they refuse to be outperformed by some of these younger actors and far surpass them in authentic entertainment. Denzel Washington is one such talent.The Equalizer is about a man with a mysterious past named Robert McCall (Denzel Washington). Robert McCall is a kind man who is extremely tidy and lives according to schedule. He works at a hardware store and is respected in his workplace. He gives a helping hand to those in need and encourages them. The buildup of this character makes the audience automatically like him. He is a person everyone wants to know and a friend everyone wants to have. As I said, he is extremely likable. However, as with most interesting characters, he has an unknown and mysterious past. I am not going to spoil anything but let's just say this guy can hold his own almost any situation. Robert McCall finds himself unable to sleep most nights and befriends a young prostitute named Teri (ChloÃ« Grace Moretz) whom he meets at a late night diner. Basically, the plot unfolds when Teri finds herself in distress and Robert McCall finds himself reluctantly resurfacing a former skill he vowed to never perform again to help her. This causes a chain reaction of hostile events to unfold forcing McCall back into a life he thought was behind him. The villain in this film is Teddy (Marton Csokas). I have to say, I was pretty impressed with this character. He just made a great villain. Marton Csokas has come a long way since his role as Yorgi in xXx. I was very impressed with the progression in his acting abilities. His performance was another key factor in the success of this film.So my verdict for The Equalizer is definitely two thumbs way up. This is all around a very entertaining film. The story is great and builds a strong foundation for the characters, the action and fight scenes are choreographed nicely, the acting talent really draws the audience in, and the directing is very commendable. In short, The Equalizer leaves the audience fully satisfied and wanting for nothing. I encourage everyone to see this movie. I really enjoyed it and know most of you will also. Until next Wednesday, I wish you all great cinematic experiences.Read more of my reviews at TheBrewBuzz.com",10,9,23,2 October 2014
