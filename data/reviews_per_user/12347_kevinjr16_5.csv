Angels & Demons," Pretty good. At least not a snoozefest.
","I thought this movie was pretty good. I never read the book and never will. Its kind of predictable but way way better than the davinci code. The best word to describe this movie is Grand. Its very visionary and no doubt controversial, especially among catholics, but entertaining nonetheless. The opening was very very good and the movie had me riveted in my seat the whole time. The long boring conversations of the first are now replaced by tension and ticking doomsday clock. The race is on to uncover the truth and expose the secret behind the illuminatti. Tom Hanks offered a decent performance but i think Ewan McGregor was excellent as the carmelango. The girl was pretty much just there to throw another girl into the mix as she really ends up having no purpose whatsoever. So definitely go check this movie out.",8,2,6,17 May 2009
The Hangover," Hilarious!!!
","This movie is definitely worth seeing. The entire cast is hilarious and the story is goofy but not silly. Think Harold and kumar meets road trip. I went in expecting a mediocre movie with a few laughs but i was laughing the entire time and it was just as good as knocked up or the 40 year old virgin. This is not your over done Vegas movie. This is 4 guys getting as fu**ed up as they can get in one night and then the hell they go through the next day. Without spoiling anything, lets just say it involves chapels and the Chinese. I will be seeing this movie in the theatres at least once more. Do yourself a favor and go see this movie.",9,1,3,13 June 2009
Terminator Salvation," Surprisingly good!
","When I first saw the god awful previews and promo items i immediately lost any interest in this movie. The more i found out the more stupid it appeared. After it came out and i saw the reviews i thought, oh what the hell ill go check it out. Well i am pleased to report that i was pleasantly surprised. From the starting moments i was glued to my seat until the final awesome climax. And there's a little surprise for you in the final battle. :-) There is a good mix of action and drama though this is mostly an action flick. Sam worthington definitely steals the show from Christian bale who was a little stale in my opinion. This movie is definitely worth the money and possibly repeat viewings.",9,2,8,22 May 2009
Shutter Island," Really????
","The main question going through my mind after seeing this movie was, Really? The whole time it seems rather obvious what is going on and i kept waiting for the big twist where i was wrong, but the end had no twist whatsoever and it ended exactly like you think its going to from the start. It dispels any illusion of terror or foreboding when you know exactly what is happening the whole time. This is a sad sad movie for the legendary scorcese. It wasn't a horror movie in the slightest and while it tried to be a phsycological thriller it never once pulled it off. Ben kingsleys character basically told you in the first 10 minutes how it would play out. I was hoping this was going to be good but i left very disappointed. Not recommended unless you can netflix it.",6,6,15,19 February 2010
Kick-Ass," Wow. Don't listen to the crybabies.
",This movie is very very good. I'm not going to go into why just know that its better than the dark knight. The real reason im on here is to counteract the lame crybabies. (roger ebert im talking about you.) Yes the violence isover the top. But this is a masterful movie and at the center of it shines hit girl. This movie isn't really about kick ass at all. Its about the story of big daddy and hit girl's revenge. Its a gripping tale that can only be achieved by extreme violence as the bad guys here are truly bad. People are way too used to the lame comic book bad guys that stand around and chat away giving the hero time to foil their plans. Not these guys. They don't f**k around. They will shoot you in the face and laugh about the way your head exploded. So to take them down calls for extreme measures. All i can say is grow the f**k up people and grow some balls. This movie works on every level.,10,1,16,17 April 2010
