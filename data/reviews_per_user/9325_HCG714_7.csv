The Blair Witch Project," The Blair Witch was crap, so why did Artisan buy it?????
","The Blair Witch Project was stupid and I love horror movies but this piece of crap was not scary,  what was scary was to stand in line over an hour on the 2nd day it opened and then to sit through the most screwball horror movie that turned out to be a overacted,  badly written story.  Crap, crap, crap, and more crap was this movie....please first you shove the promo hype down the consumers throat...then you dont deliver please save us the horror and dont make a part 2...it was bad enough that theaters dont refund your money if you walk out. The Blair Witch project has some evocative moments, but on the whole its too tame to draw us into an everlasting terror.",Null,0,1,19 August 1999
The Ring," A silly Twin Peaks rip-off!
","Worst film of 2002!! Poorly written, poorly acted & poorly directed.  Namoi Watts who showed promise as an actress in 'Mulholland Drive' but she sure wasted her talents on this film.  I heard the film cost a reported $60 million to make. I sure would like to know where the $60 million went? Surely noton the screen or its plot more for the markting of this film. Another film that shows how a company like 'Dremworks' is just in the movie business to make a fast buck and not out make a truly great film. I saw this at an advance screening and boy what a waste of my time. The first 1/2 hour I was interseted in the story, & I was caught up in the mystery of the VHS tape that killed people who watched it, the last hour an 1/2 the film got boring, slow-moving and muddled; characters came and went and gave half assed answers and the characters seemed to spill over from the 'Twin Peaks' Tv show, and the ending was the biggest scam since 'The Blair Witch Project'. Not scary more like the 'The Changeling' gone high-tech. I very silly movie with enough plot holes to sink a huge ship & a film by then end that doesn't make sense and leaves more questions than answers. Thank god I saw this for free since I would been really made if I had wasted $8.00 to see this over hyped and under done film. Skip it & wait for $0.50 cents day at your local dollar theater, or better yet wait for $0.99 cents day at your local video store when your really bored. Another film that should be considered for the Rasebery Award for Worst film of 2002!",1,0,2,16 October 2002
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," 'The Fog meets 'Treasure Island'.
","Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl' has to be one film I'm addding to my 'Worst Films of 2003' list.'Pirates' has to be 'one' of the oddest, strangest, most over-the-top, far out, blockbuster film's of the summer 2003 lot. For starters, director Verbinski isn't enough of a stylist to pull off the script's delicate balancing act. As he showed with the 'The Mexican' Verbinski has problems finding just the right tone between humor and adventure. The film is never quite funny enough to make us forget that dramatically it's pretty slim stuff. With is combination of action, comedy, over the top acting, big sets and one-liners this movie couldn't be taken too seriously for an action film and it so far off the map that it couldn't be called a comedy.For one thing Johnny Depp, who delivers what has to be the strangest lead performance in a $150 million Hollywood production to date, and has to be the only one brave enough to play a gay drunk pirate this side of the Caribbean. Wait until you see what Depp does here. You can't take your eyes off him!! He is funny, crazy and he over takes every single scean he is in. Even Geoffrey Rush is over shadowed by Depps's over the top performance.Geoffrey Rush was great in his role as Barbossa, and it shows what a great actor Geoffrey Rush really his; and how multi-talented he really his even when he sells out to crap like 'The Banger Sisters' or 'pirates' He can make a really bad role work for him. But it was Depp's film and he ran with it!Keira Knightley, well not much to say except she is a really bad actress and how many times do we have to set her either wet or getting her clothes ripped off with out once having bad hair or runny make-up?Orlando Bloom was flat, his character was a cardbaord cut out of every single character out to rescuse the woman he loves and finds himself an adventure.'Pirates' was a bad movie, but Depp's over the top performance was the best thing and the only thing besides the over top F/X and interesting story line that keeps this mess afloat!Yes folks; the story had promise. Real promise. But somewhere between directors Gore Verbinski ideas, and producer Jerry Bruckheimer's ideas the story somehow merged 2 diffrent out looks with no real mediuem. The whole film felt like 'Treasure Island' meets 'The Fog'!With a running time of two hours plus, 'Pirates of the Caribbean' feels terribly flabby, even the over the top battle scenes are so drawn out we start to lose interest.Depp's odd performance should probably make this film live on as a cult classic and become recognized by film buff's as a bad film that we love.One word to describe 'Pirates' is 'BIZZARE'!",3,3,6,13 July 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Quentin Tarantino is back - with a vengeance!!
","WOW!!!'Kill Bill: Volume 1' is another film I'm adding to the top of my 'Best Films of 2003' list!!The new story is actually quite simple: Uma Thurman plays an elite killer -- nicknamed Black Mamba and a member of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (DiVAS) -- who has been in a coma for four years. When she awakes, she realizes she was betrayed by the DiVAS, who left her for dead in a pool of blood at her own wedding. The 4 years later she emerges from a coma and swears revenge on her former master and his deadly squad of international assassins.Supremely demented and grotesquely gorgeous, 'Kill Bill -- Vol. 1' is a movie that will separate the true cinema lovers from ... well, just about everyone who has another set of valuesQuentin Tarantino has done it again!! After 6 years Mr. Tarantino delievers the film that fans of his films have been waiting to see!Watching 'Kill Bill' you realize that no one combines tension and release, violence and humor, dialogue and action and music and pictures the way he does.Tarantino pulls out all the stops, not only with his odd assortment of characters, but with the use of split screen, slow motion and every other special effect he can find.'Kill Bill' is all about the action. Remember how ridiculously lame the big fight scene between Neo and the thousand Agent Smiths in 'The Matrix Reloaded' looked? You won't get any of that here. There's no CG, and that makes the fight scenes so much more satisfying.Uma Thurman gives one hell of a tour de' force perfomance. She is both fragile and delicate then in the next moment she is lets it all go. If the Gods smile upon Uma she could be looking at her 2nd Oscar nod next year!And Volume 2? I can't wait.",10,0,1,10 October 2003
From Hell," Can't wait to visit Whitechapel again!
","Wow! Not predectiable or boring like some of the current films out there in moive land. This film is on my Best Films of 2001 list. To be frank one of the best films of the month of October 2001. I wish this film came out in the summer of 2001 to save us from such idot films like 'Planet of the Apes' or Jurassic Park 3'. Hats off to the Hughes Brothers for a a very thought provoking film. Orginial, thought provoking and what an excellent use of film technics. I loved the sets, art direction, the use of shadow & lights, primary colors and time lapse photography to heighten the tense situation. The score was great too, very dark and haunting, I can't wait to own the soundtrack. The Hughes brothers deserve an Oscar nod for Best dirctor, and Ian Holm desvers an Oscar nod for Best actor for his role. Great film. An instant cult classic. Great way the Hughes brothers mixed fact and fiction and put some new twists on the tale & legend of Jack the Ripper. I highly reccomed this film. A great film for discussion afterwards. For the strong and mature and very open minded. Can't wait too see it a 2nd time. Not to be missed, forget the rest and see 'From Hell'. Alot of great suprises along the way too.",10,1,2,20 October 2001
Mystic River," 'Mystic River' is not that mystical.
","'Mystic River' was 'not one of the best films of 2003, nor one of the worst films of2003, it was just there in the middle.I'm still scratching my head and wondering what all the buzz and fuss is about in 'Mystic River', except mabey for the over the top performance by some of today's hottest talents. The whole film like one big case study in Acting 101.Like I have stated the only fun in this plodding production is trying to figure out who gives the most over the top performance. Is it Sean Penn, complete with gnashing teeth and tightly flexed biceps, doing a second-rate Kirk Douglas? Or is it Laurence Fishburne trying to be the next Sidney Poitier for a new generation? Or is it Marcia Gay Harden, whose gaping mouth and wide eye stare recall a fish on ice? Or Laura Linney, who fills her mouth with so many flattened vowels that her Boston accent comes off as fake as Kevin Costner's in '13 Days'? & Ms. Linney really doesn't do anything in the film until the final 10 minutes anyways. I kept getting the feeling through out the film like Clnt kept saying on the set of 'Mystic River' more acting more acting less plot less plot!I've always thought that Clint Eastwood is a fine actor, and often a fine director, too. But most of the time when he adapts books that he claims to love into movies, I'm alternating between boredom and disbelief. 'Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil' was such a fascinating, insidious and evilly fun little story... until Eastwood got a hold of it.The story was flat, predectiable and by the end I felt 'Mystic River' lacked something big. It was like eating a slice of cake with out the frosting. When you finally find out who murdered Jimmy's daughter (after a grueling 2 hours and 15 minutes), it's contrived, convoluted and laughable.Mystic River may not be the 'worst' movie I've seen all year, but it certainly is the most dull, dreary and disappointing (I give it a generous C-, in case you haven't guessed).I didn't hate Mystic River - I was just incredibly disappointed by the film.",3,5,7,28 October 2003
Signs," The only 'Signs' to look for are the exit signs!
","Worst film of 2002!! Poorly written, poorly acted and the most over rated, over bloated acting this side of a really bad Roger Corman film!! After seeing Mel pimp this film on every talk show, looking at nefty trailers and a nefty website I was trilled to see 'Signs' on opening night! Boy I was 100% wrong! This film was bad! It was boring, it was laughable and the ending was the worst. There was not one mind blowing climax, no thrills or chills, just lots of Zzzzzzzzzzs and Z grade acting with Mel looking for another Oscar & Mr. Phoenix wasting his talents!!! M. Night Shmalyan is a 1 hit wonder director. 'The Sixth Sense' was great, after that forget it even 'Wide Awake' was bad! This man can't direct! Know wonder he is compared to Steven Spilberg, they both make over rated, over hyped films that add up to nothing but a big fat zero!. After spending 2 hrs in movie hell with 'Signs', I saw 'Full Frontal' the same night as well. 'Full Frontal was alot better, & at least Steven Soderbergh has imagination and knows the definetion of diretor unlike some directors that need a PR person to find the answer in a book! The whole idea of 'Wheres God?' mixed with strange shapes made out of corn, Mel acting like a fallen priest with no faith (I had no faith in this script so we were both doing good!) with close-ups of sweaty Mel sounding like he was having an orgasam with the end of the world theme running throuhgh it etc. was just to much to take with out laughing out loud or giggling at the fact that someone somewhere wrote this B-grade wanna-be cult film. This had the silliest plot since say 'Plan 9 From Outerspace or even 'ID4' for that matter'! 'This film was 'Field of Dreams' Meets 'Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind'! No sense, no purpose just a film for actors to get paid lots of money to make a really crappy, dull and non-intelligent film, by a director that needs to take sometime off and find out what it means to make good quality film or at least attend 1 film class at a film school!! The Raseberry Award for worst film should go to 'Signs' as well as the Rasberry award for Worst actor and worst dirctor! The only reson this film is #1 is that it was hyped to the max and poor movie goers like me were suckered into spending hard earned movie money to see a film that we thought was going to be scary, fun etc, all it turned out to be was cheap cartoon art. The only thing scary was the fact that Hollywood spent money making this film when the same production costs could have been making a better film with more imagination & story!  Worst film of 2002!!!!",1,1,2,11 August 2002
