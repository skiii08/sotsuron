Hereditary," Hereditary
","('Hereditary' is a film about the conscious, existential suffering of perpetual mystery. We hand it down to our children, a box of secrets wrapped in a black bow, and gift them the opportunity to make sense of what their parents couldn't make sense of. When all you know is the unknowing, there is nowhere to go, it's impossible to evolve, all paths lead to more unknowns. The family tree has dark, piercing roots that spiral down into the ground, darker and darker, deeper and deeper into Hell. We never know where it begins. Who set us on the path?)It's not often that I'm impressed by a modern horror film, but 'Hereditary' was absolutely excellent. It had the intensity and despair of Bergman or Cassavetes, with acting at that impressive level, yet it also boasted the gritty malignancy of the best 70s horror. When I was in the cinema I felt that the audience was unprepared for what they were viewing (even I was, except it was a pleasant surprise to me, since I live for bleak filmmaking), and made deeply uncomfortable because of it, expecting a typically overrated, easy-viewing CGI horror flick and many had to giggle uncomfortably at times -- especially at the ending, in some kind of transparent coping mechanism when viewing a film as suffocatingly bleak as 'Cries and Whispers', which in a sense was a horror film, because real horror lies in what we can relate to, such as sudden death and the near-insanity that comes with grief.Both the cinematography, with its long shots and the pacing were exceptionally good and added so much depth to the experience, which is really unusual for this era; this came across as a film that was made for both existentialist Euro art house lovers and hardcore 70s horror fans, which has been attempted more and more recently, but this one got it right. There are some moments I would have excised, but if you want perfection you aren't getting it in corporate 2018. I have no idea why the marketing has to be, 'the scariest film since the Exorcist', since that's ridiculous and will only serve to unnecessarily and unfairly turn people against the film, but I suppose, 'one of the few modern horror films that genuinely isn't dogshit' doesn't sound as enticing. A near-masterpiece.",8,2,4,4 July 2018
A Quiet Place," A Quiet Place.
","'A Quiet Place' attempts to take the interesting themes of the existential and isolating loneliness of deafness and the body horror of pregnancy with its threat of childbirth pain and/or complications to create something poignant and compelling, but with the exception of a couple of bold moments, the film mostly fails due to some lazy and derivative horror filmmaking conventions (completely unscary post-Giger CGI, a myriad of obnoxious jump-scares, overbearing 'emotional' music cues, etc.).Despite the hype, this is yet another merely competent modern horror film, an allegory about how scary parenthood is, which is a painfully heteronormative and middle-class thing to get horrified over, when you think about it.However, this is certainly one way of getting around the persistent problem of atrocious dialogue in modern film -- just have everyone keep it buttoned.",6,1,1,3 May 2018
Annihilation," Annihilation
","Po-faced and 'intellectual' sci-fi that thinks it is smarter than it really is seems to be the in-thing now, with 'Annihilation' and the much-ballyhooed 'Arrival', but this is probably the more enjoyable film. Instead of physics, today's lesson is biology, so get your study materials ready.Not unlike hundreds of other films in its wake, 'Annhilation' follows the exact same formula of 1979's 'Alien' in tone, story, Giger-designed-looking structures and female heroine lead, but this is one of the better versions thanks to some excellent, atmospheric cinematography and pacing that actually respects the attention-span of the viewer (which was one of the truly subversive and brilliant things about 'Alien' that doesn't get mentioned as much, in a film that was full of genius ideas). Admittedly, the pacing probably seems good because the writing is so thin, so it's not like we have a lot of developments to cram in here.The acting is also very good but it's largely in vain, because this film never feels as tense or as frightening as it should; and even worse, the characters are paper-thin and unlikeable, and we can list them as: 'The Adulterous One' (which admittedly is interesting within the context of multiplying cells and splitting yourself between multiple people, losing yourself in the process -- the existential theme of the film), 'The Gay One' (we would have worked it out for ourselves but just in case, we get some out-of-place flirtation dialogue),'The Sheepish Self-Harming One' and 'The Dying One with Nothing to Lose' (..but does Jennifer Jason Leigh ever not look cool?).Cancer metaphors like these have been around in sci-fi literature (Ballard) and film for some time ('Akira'), but 'Annilation' still feels like a spirited attempt at trying something creative, that almost works.",7,0,1,30 March 2018
Alien: Covenant," 'Alien: Covenant' is a dichotomy of creativity and banality.
","'Alien: Covenant' is a dichotomy of creativity and banality; the film manages to be both uncommonly viscerally ugly, which feels brave, and yet also vapidly glossy, underwritten and compromised for the sake of commerciality. The former is hugely exciting and the latter is a great disappointment.Inspired, thrilling moments stand shoulder-to-shoulder with predictable and lazy scenes; the characters are shallow, uninteresting and never feel real, like the crew of the Nostromo did -- that film allowed the characters to breathe and be real people -- we cared about them. The characters suffer loses, designed for us to empathise with them, but they just feel like cannon fodder. We simply wait for them to die, we don't ever fear that they will.'Alien: Covenant' feels more like a reboot than an appendage. If a reboot is what it is, it has to be considered both a failure and absolutely pointless on an artistic level (like all other horror reboots are), because the original does everything more convincingly, with more sincerity, energy, creativity and drama. If it is a smaller work designed to add (a massively confusing) background story to a masterpiece of terror that all realise can never be topped, then it is a success -- assuming you can work out the story, because I lost track of it.As was a problem with 'Prometheus', the script is often appalling. 'What the Hell is that?' is never a good line when you can see with your own eyes that the character is scared and confused, it doesn't have to be verbalised. The film also contains one of the most contrived, unnecessary sex scenes in film history -- it was clearly included to tick the box.The original Xenomorph alien is still by far the most terrifying of all horror film creations, it feels like something that genuinely exists.. somewhere.. not in space, but deep within our souls: a combination of every fear and phobia known to mankind, born of bone and acid. It deserves to be featured in film for as long as movies as made. The more aggressive, smaller variant is horrific in its speed, violence and aggression, and in one brilliant scene involving Michael Fassbinder, in which the alien stands upright like a man, the creature could be inspired by the horror of Francis Bacon's 'Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion'.Michael Fassbinder is outstanding. David is the only character in the film that is truly easy to relate to; that he is the only evil character in the film is either very telling about mankind, or it displays the ineffective writing and shallowness of the other characters. David is lonely; he doesn't truly know what he is or why he exists; he feels superior to the humans that created him, yet he attempts to emulate their sexual impulses, to copy them, he tries to be like them; he is intellectually self-assured, yet (as he realises with shock) flawed and incomplete; he thinks that mankind doesn't deserve a fresh start on a new planet after murdering Earth (which is absolutely hard to argue with); he is a contradiction: he wants to be a God only to destroy what he resents, yet he convinces himself he is a Creator, not a Destroyer. David manages to be scarier even than the Xenomorphs -- the film attempts to shock us with its gory scenes, but David's psychology is truly where the shock and awe lies. The homoerotic tension between David and Walter, two identical androids, is a brilliant parody of man's eternally hopeless vanity.When a film like this is made, what it sometimes unintentionally achieves is just to draw attention to the original: Sigourney Weaver was clearly irreplaceable in her role as the hunted female with the mental strength of ten lions; neither Noomi Rapace in 'Prometheus' nor Katherine Waterston in this film manage to recreate her convincing intensity or iconic toughness.The twist ending is entirely predictable but not in a bad way -- films do not have to be unpredictable all the time. If a predictable ending is the best ending available, it should be the ending; a different, inferior ending just for the sake of surprising people would be wrong.Ridley Scott is both a major talent and a very clever man with good ideas, but this simply isn't the same world that it was in 1979: creating a major blockbuster horror movie with the intellectual depth of the original 'Alien' is a near-impossible feat. This is as good as it's going to get.There's a battle going on in space, but it's really between a fascinating, intellectual film and a painfully dumb one.",6,7,18,14 May 2017
