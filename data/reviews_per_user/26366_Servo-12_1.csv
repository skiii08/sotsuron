Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A great new Star Wars movie!
","I went to see Menace in the theater last night with good feelings about what I was going to see, and I was right!!! Episode 1 is an action packed movie with a good story and nicely worked characters. At least I thought it was, any critic would probably not say it is as good as all this. It has spectacular effects that made awesome sequences like the pod race and the ending duel which to me was the best part of the film {wasn't it everybody's!} And offers things we have not seen much of in the other movies like the Sith and more than one Jedi which have been highly trained.",Null,0,0,23 May 1999
