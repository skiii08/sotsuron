The Ring," Knowing there's an original helps
","Okay, so now I feel relieved knowing there is an original to this dissapointment. I was really looking forward to seeing a spooky, creepy movie but it didn't sustain the 'creep' enough for me. It couldn't even suspend my suspension of disbelief. Since I am unable to give a proper analysis of this film, I recommend viewing the original. The name of the film is on another viewers comment.",Null,0,0,9 December 2002
Monster," And the Oscar for Best Actress SHOULD go to...
","Charlize Theron. Girlfriend got the job done. I doubt I could have gained thirty pounds, got my hair thinned out, flawless skin splotched, and played this damaged woman. It took ALOT of courage to pull this woman off. Plus it was much more enlightening to see another beautiful actress ( ex:Fawsett, Field, Streep, Berry, Kidman)deglamorize herself for such a tough role. These are the roles that receive recognition and demand respect. I'm impressed. I was very pleased with Miss Theron's performance in this film based on the female serial killer Aileen Wournos. I also don't want to forget Christina Ricci. She did a good job as supporting actress. I dragged anybody I could to see this movie and it was only playing in two theaters. This movie was awesome. Though very disturbing in some scenes, I managed to bear through it. Some will argue it was a movie begging sympathy out of us, another chick flick, and it did. But this movie showed me (just like Gia along other sad movies in this genre) is that there are people who hurt like this everyday. We ignore them, pass them off, tip our noses up or turn our heads away from them. Yeah Miss Wournos was wrong for her actions, but she could have been helped. She could have been helped. Her life was a testimony and I'm proud to have seen it.",Null,0,0,26 January 2004
Memento," Is there a word better than outstanding?
","The most original movie I had ever witnessed. Well along with the movie Angel Heart which is the bomb.com. I won't give anything away either. What more can I say? It sure as hell deserved its rating. Its just as simple as the summary about a man who after a tragic incident involving the rape and murder of his wife suffers from amnesia and uses notes in the form of tattoos on his body to remember and to hopefully avenge the murder of his wife. I'm sure someone has a better summary.The fascination with this movie is how it affects you as you watch it unfold revealing itself and how it makes you feel afterwards. Then you come out with different opinions to the ending. Amazing.There are a limited number of movies that can affect you like this. Its rare nowadays that you can still spook and boggle the minds of today's audiences. This movie confused me at first, yet I felt spooked and then after a second viewing the story unfolded right before my eyes, it scared the sh*t out of me. I was horrified. And when I say horrified, I'm literally horrified for people who actually  suffer from this form of illness. Fine performances by everyone and the script was off the hook.",Null,0,2,10 January 2003
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," Entertaining but cliched.
","I hesitated on seeing this movie because of the title alone. In reality, it doesn't take ten days. Try ten minutes. And after ten minutes you know you'll get a another formalic comedic/love/drama chick flick recycled with a new lead actress (in this case Kate Hudson)and a predictable ending. We've already witnessed Matthew in this genre, so have we seen anything different? No.On the positive, I did enjoy watching this movie simply for the entertainment, and to give Kate another chance. I had only seen Ms. Hudson in Four Feathers and thought she didn't do anything special with her role. But she lit the screen in this film. Like her mother, she has a flare for comedic talent and can carry a lead role pretty well. I hope she doesn't get a boob job either.The problem I find with this film is the cliches. All the characters are high maintenance, shallow, and superficial. Its ideal but not attained by all. The whole time I was thinking the audiences reaction if the characters were working class people who didn't live in New York or LA but say Ohio or Houston. Not a poor girl falling in love and marrying a rich guy either. People with problems. People on Xanex. People in debt and getting calls by the credit folks every other day.Not every guy knows how to cook, be patient, and be as polished and well groomed like Matthew's character. Lets just say people who aren't as privileged and advanced as these hollow characters. Let me also add that its a bit sexist. Why do the views always have to be one-sided? Women always trying to get a man. Trying to impress. Playing games. What about the truth of what makes guys tick and what women allow. And for that matter, if you really wanted to know what it took, learn to operate under discernment cause you may want to lose that guy in ten seconds.",Null,0,0,10 March 2003
The Others," Good spooky film
","Its nice to watch something and be surprised in a while. It was not better than the sixth sense but on the same level. I was pleased.  This had the 'spook' in spook. Spookier than The Ring and much better. Its been a while since I had seen it and like the sixth sense, you can only get spooked once and thats good enough. I recommend it to anyone who likes Kidman and the sixth sense.",Null,0,0,10 January 2003
Troy," Perfect
","Yes I said it. When a movie you anticipate has you anticipating for more and you're still pleased...well thats perfection to me. I felt like a kid watching Star Wars or Indiana Jones for the first time. It was fun and that's how I took it.Hollywood managed not to screw this one up. Instead, they let Mr. Peterson do his job. Why this movie is a winner with me is quite simple. Its mass and its production was quite impressive. For an epic picture done on this scale including the CGI, cinematography, and the intensity of the one on one combat scenes was more than adequate for the occasion. It entertained me. That's what movies are made for and considering its 165 minute span, I wasn't bored once.  Another reason why this movie was such a hit was due to the performances. Every actor convinced me of their role but it was both Eric Bana and Brian Cox's performances that stood out for me. You could tell every actor wanted in on this project and was proud. Every actor and actress gave their best.
 As for Brad Pitt being considered a miscast, I had to see for myself. Its a shame when critics try to ruin a motion picture for you based on their prejudices. I would have missed another great performance out of Mr. Pitt. The dialogue was a bit challenging but he made up for it with the fight scenes and his charisma for the character. I did feel the connection between his former role as Tristian in 'Legends of the Fall' with the Achilles role. The expressions, the rebelliousness, the physical demands. He did good a job. Why all the down talk? He still brought in the dollars. Brad Pitt just has it like that. Is it worth repeated viewings? I waited till the following Monday to see it again. However, I learned my lesson with the Matrix Trilogy burnout. Wait till video.",Null,1,2,18 May 2004
Blade II," Better than the first
","I enjoyed the hell out of this movie and I'm not a fan of the vampire genre. Wesley did real good the second time around. I was impressed. In movies I look for pacing, the degree of the conflict and the perfomances of the actors and actresses. Who carries the film? Well obviously Wesley and his nemesis. There was more martial arts, and I wasn't bored. The fight scenes were incisive, correct, and if you can believe this, beautiful. It was like they were dancing. Choreographed to perfection. Jet Li of course is a master at this. I won't give anything away. Check it out if you haven't already.",Null,0,1,6 November 2002
Lost in Translation," Pleasant to Watch
","I actually found this movie to be enjoyable. I wasn't expecting the anticipation from this movie to appear so bleak, but it was pleasing nonetheless. The title of the movie speaks for itself as the story between these two lost individuals (Murray and Johannassen) occur as the translation unfolds, if that makes any sense.  Being in a foreign land can be at times a bit confounding without having someone to connect with.
I guess what makes this story a treasure in all areas of film is that it was realistic. As human beings I think we all share the common humanity to relate to someone or something. The location was perfect for the title alone. The cinematography, the culture, the interaction between people in this film was phenomenal,simple, amusing, and confusing. I personally found myself in and out of both the leading characters emotions. I could relate. I could relate to the simple silence shared between the two. Sometimes more action occurs in one scene without dialogue and I found that impressive.
Although I'm not comparing Sophia's method of directing to Paul Thomas Anderson's, I do find that their styled use of story is similar and very interesting.",Null,0,1,2 March 2004
Glory," Denzel's
","This was an excellent historical movie based on the 54th Regiment who were the first black soldiers who fought during the Civil War. This movie was right on time. Not glamorized, not commercialized, just a phenomenal piece that Hollywood managed not to screw up. I really enjoyed Matthew Broderick's portrayal as the idealistic leader in charge. His personal journalistic account made the story flow with such delicacy and ease. Its been a while since I've seen the movie that I forgot that Morgan Freeman (a heavyweight in his own right)had starred in it as well. All the characters performances were real and concise.I remember the character Snowflake who added a sense of comic relief and definite realism. The war scenes were brutal and neccessary. Everything about this movie was perfect. But the Glory here belongs to Denzel Washington. He owned the character and the spotlight and the moment as he stood to accept his Academy Award for best Supporting Actor. Aside from other great films like Crimson Tide, Malcom X,The Hurricane (I didn't see this one), and yes, even Training Day,they shine second to this performance. They are just the blessed result(s) of a brilliant actor. And it would be redundant to comment on his other movies. This performance speaks for the rest. You'll never get less than the best from Denzel.",Null,0,0,4 March 2003
The Italian Job," As far as Summer Blockbusters go...
","I rate this one better than the Matrix Reloaded. This one wasn't as complicated and it simply gave me what I wanted. I thorougly enjoyed this Summer film. Even as I anticipated it and watched it, I never compared it to other heist movies. I took it for what it was. And since the summary's been told about this film, I'll mention the pros and con of this movie. I didn't want to compare but it shares some of Ocean's ll features. Now like Ocean's 11, its a remake, it had its all-star cast,individual querks of the characters, its comical moments, a heist to accomplish and a girl. But instead of pushing clothing fashion, the IJ pushes fashionable Mini Coopers. I wanted to buy one as the ending credits rolled.  Memorable characters that stood out was Seth Green's character. I thought the Napster element added great comic relief along with Mos Def's character Left Ear. Even Stratham's character as Handsome Rob left a favorable impression. I just don't get how everyone has dogged E. Norton's acting ability. He is highly underrated. Anyone who dogs this guy has never seen American History X or Primal Fear. He gives awesome performances.I like how they didn't make Marky Mark and Charlize fall in love and kiss all over each other. No time for that. The pacing was succinct and I wasn't bored because sometimes movies can stall on you.Okay a con, well...I could wait till it came out on video. I mean an excellent movie is one I could see over and over. One viewing is adequate.",Null,0,0,2 July 2003
Cold Mountain," Another Good One
","And I wasn't expecting to like this movie. I shunned away from it at all costs. Let's see, in quick summation of the movie, we have a civil war drama genre type film. Arguably considered a chick flick but whatever. We have war, death, saving graces, angels in the form of Renee's character and even Jude Law's character. Plus don't forget the obstacles between Kidman's and Law's character. Then we have the ultmate reason that drives this movie: Love. It was good. I never realized Jude Law was so pretty. Wonderful perfomances from everyone.",Null,0,0,26 January 2004
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," I didn't feel it.
","They should have left the third one alone. I mean it was fine with the sequel but Hollywood has to drain every commodity they can get a profit off of. What a bore. Drain us with something good at least.There were just too many things wrong with this one. First of all, they left Cameron out the picture. Had they kept his touch, we probably would have had something. I don't know, a better picture.
Second, what's up with all these new characters and their role? The plot was underdeveloped. The female Terminator did her job but it was way too cliched for me. I kept thinking of the Destruction of Eve or something and they always wear red. And third, Now I know Terminator came before Matrix but damn, two sci-fi movies back to back in one summer about humans battling it against the machines just overwhelms me. It should have came before May of this year perhaps. Arnold getting too damn old anyways. I still like him though. He'll always be the trailblazer and one of the greatest action heros of the time.
But over all, I just didn't feel it. I don't hold it against you Arnold.",Null,0,0,15 August 2003
Ocean's Eleven," I liked it
","Compared to the 60's classic, this one blows the old one away. This was a fashion/comedy/heist movie. I guess the idea of an ensemble cast with egos bumping egos probably turned a few people off. And some remakes do butcher the originals. Thats a true statement but this remake was definately worth the punch. I liked it. This one was more technologiclly advanced, modern, and polished. And the fashion. Clooney's style appeared sophisticated, Garcia's elegant, Julia's okay, and Pitt's immaculate. The comedic tone in this film was great. The Cahn kid and his side-kick played well off of each other. Damon was bland but appropriate for the role. It would have helped if he had a better physique. Bernie Mack was perfect for his role. Cheadle didn't need the accent but it worked out. Everyone played their part well and it showed. The music and the pacing was appropriate. May be room for a sequel? Overall, I was impressed.",Null,0,0,6 November 2002
Blue Crush," Good
","One little spoiler but relevant.How could I forget Blue Crush? This was such a good movie. I was entertained. While watching it, I just got this new found respect for women in sports period. Hell this movie, as mediocre as it appeared to others, showed that women are just as good as men at surfing. It also showed that we can ultimately find our true selves through our greatest fear(s). The lead character would have been forever tormenting herself if she never tried. It rings so true to life with all of us in anything. A gift, a dream, whatever. Bosworth did a good job and is such a cutie. Her character was so grounded. They didn't gloss these girls up (not idealistic but realistic) and I appreciate that. It takes alot of balls and discipline to do this sport. Check out that underwater scene with Bosworth running under water carrying the rock with her friends on her shoulders. Hell I couldn't do that.",Null,0,0,6 February 2003
The Pianist," Based on Brody's Performance
","This was a fine film documenting the true life story of a famous musician played very well by Adrian Brody. I have to admit though that when I first heard about this movie I rolled my eyes and cringed at the thought of 'another Holocoust movie'. Now this is not to dismiss or disrespect the inhumane acts of what was done in history, but its been done before. There was nothing new or original brought to this story and I am still baffled by the oscar win that Mr. Polanski didn't deserve. I think this movie was won more out of hype than anything. I was however, very impressed with Mr. Brody's performance. To play such a deglamorized,humble, and vulnerable role. It was a naked performance, and I personally consider those the best kind.",Null,0,1,3 June 2003
8 Mile," Eminem, I am impressed.
","This was actually a good movie. I had wanted to see it when the trailers came out but could wait till video. There's nothing like a scared white boy with heart. It shows a sense of humility and he had that in this movie. Too bad there ain't enough of them. And for sensitive people that didnt get what I said , its  not a racist statement. Its just the truth. He's scared and that's the best place to be.For anybody who is an underdog. Doesn't necessrily mean race; it could mean indifference in any kind of way. He just happens to be a white boy who is the outcast. Black people been outcasts since the beginning. So whats the big deal? He also shows that rap (that is before the 'hip-hop' word came along)is an art and that it is a culture of the African American community. Its a way of life to express yourself through words and ryhme. I appreciate that. It wasn't demeaned in any way. He showed it positively. I'm glad someone out there shows  that rap ain't all about being a baller, a bitch and a banger. The rappers who do the above don't realize how embarrassingly stupid it sounds. True its a disgrace. But rap with meaning is about verbal expression, a culture. Just don't use the 'N' word Eminem towards the culture that accepted you and you'll be alright.",Null,0,0,11 November 2002
The Last Samurai," Pleasing to the Eye yet questionable
","This was yet another interesting film to watch and enjoy for the year 2003. I however, patiently waited for it to come to the dollar show. Initially, I thought it was another movie seen before. Another miss. So with a story as historically enriched and complex as this one, I can only give my perception of the film. *Spoiler Warning Ahead* My overall impression of the film was that the overall performances were admirable from everyone. I felt the fellowship, the honor, the courage and the fight for the Samurai tradition to prevail with a little Braveheart and Dances with Wolves thrown in. Hell even a taste of The Last Emperor. What I didn't feel was the story's credibility and ending. Tom Cruise plays Nathan Algren who is a damaged war veteran who drowns himself in whiskey and despair. He is then called upon by Colonel Bagley (Tony Goldwyn) to train unskilled Japanese soldiers for war. During a fight, he gets kidnapped by the enemy Katsumoto and his men. Instead of killing Algren, Katsumoto (played very well by Ken Watanabe) spares his life 'to learn his enemy'. As a result, Algren learns to love and respect his enemy and joins them in the battle(s) to preserve their heritage. I'm missing some key points here but I'm sure its been summarized somewhere else.What I found intriguing about this story is the respect and discipline the Samurai people lived by. The culture alone is so rich and unique. One of the driving themes of this story is the Traditional codes these Samurai people lived by. Once Algren is kidnapped, he is thrown into a world and concept unlike the life he knew. You could say that he is literally thrown into self-discovery, peace and through this peace, he discovers  a life of simplicity and careful fellowship that it enriches his life. He becomes focused. I also found Algren's perseverance admirable.
So what are the things that turned me off? Tom Cruise being the last Samurai. In that last battlefield scene, he should have died but being Hollywood, we are forced to suspend our disbelief. I just didn't appreciate that. Then he limps himself in to give the Emperor Katsumoto's sword. He just comes out with a limp and tears. The Emperor should have just let him commit Seppuku. Then the Emperor decides to become a leader and deny a treaty they battled over. I'm not feeling that. Overall, a watchable film just not credible.",Null,0,0,12 March 2004
Pulp Fiction," A scriptwriters dream
","I initially saw this movie because there was alot of talk and press at the time the movie came out. It brought back Travolta's career. Look at the load of movies he pulled out in the 90's after this. And it put Samuel on the map for good. It also acknowledged other underrated great actors.This isn't my favorite movie and I would never have to see it again. It was very disturbing to watch but very real. This movie also went against Hollywood's usual conduct of restraint. This movie had no restraints.I can't even give a summation of the story, but I applaud Q. Taratino for his artistic merit. He is very innovative and different. This movie was based on content, originality and style. I personally thought his best work was True Romance, From Dusk till Dawn, and Resorvoir Dogs. The key is in the script writing. He focuses on real characters with real dialogue. Not the cheesy kind and isn't afraid to touch racial/social differences that may be offensive. I truly think he is one of a kind and Pulp Fiction proved that.",Null,2,5,27 February 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," Visually Stunning, Story Sucked
","And there were so many good upgrades to this movie. I'll discuss my initial impression. To begin with, it was good to see Morpheous, Neo and Trinity back. Jada as Niobe did a fantastic job,and it was great seeing the Oracle one last time,RIP. And I can't forget Agent Smith or Smiths.Let me just say that the costume design was off the hook. Give me the Latex dress or Keanu's suit. But it was like that in the first Matrix too. We are introduced to new characters and the ones I found that were impressive were the blond dread-locked twins. They were invincible, immaculate you could say.
And now the best part that deserves a paragraph of its own. The special effects. Yes it was animated but worth a view. The action fight scenes were excellent. Like I said visually stunning. Keanu did such a good job in making it look effortless and look DAMN good doing it. It was choreographed to perfection. And everybody had their ten minutes to show their moves as well. Morpheous and the sword scene. Morpheous and the car scene, it was constricted but cool. The agents, they got a serious upgrade. Carrie Moss did a great job with her motorcycle scene. She can hold her own. Say the female version of Neo only not the One. And now the unfortunate part. I didn't care for the life of Zion that they showed in the first act. A little too far-fetched and imaginative. Too forced too brief. There is alot to take in. You either feel it or you don't.I thought the love scene was very respectful and PG compared to the porn they practically show on regular TV. But like I said, all too quick to take in. Story was off-base to me. Too brief with the plot development.The first Matrix was just so fresh and energetic and new. You could take all the movie in with the first or second viewing. I think the W brothers lost their focus from the initial story, or maybe it needs a second viewing. And by the time the story got to the architect, it just felt like a head trip. If they wanted to go somewhere with this, it should be made into a television series. Not a trilogy or a movie. Its not going to be complete with a trilogy. A story as complex as the Matrix continues. And yet I'm hungry enough for the Revolution and to see Keanu in that DAMN suit.",Null,0,0,16 May 2003
Enemy at the Gates," The love scene

Now yes this war film is also good for its historical matter and documents the real life Russian sniper Vassili Zaitsev played very well by Jude Law. Since this is a war movie containing violence and sharp camera angles, it also had good character development. But the love scene in this movie was so real and the good thing about it is that you never expected it. It was innocent and decent.

One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Worthy of its rating
",This should be one of the top 250 best films of all time. Its well deserved. I cried the first time I saw it. Then was disturbed the rest of the evening. The book was better or just as good depending on how you look at it. And I can't say that to most films adapted by novels. Jack Nicholson did an excellent job in portraying the the lead character. He was just like that in the book. All the characters especially the Chief. Overall I was pleased. I have nothing to butcher about this movie.,Null,0,1,8 January 2003
X2: X-Men United," Better than the first one
",My bad for not commenting on this one earlier. I enjoyed this Summer Hit. It did so well at the box office and both children and adults enjoyed this one I think the second time around. I enjoyed this one so much because we got to see more of the mutants utilize their gifts. That was fun to watch. They also shared a human personal side to the mutants.I'm one of the few unfortunates who have never read the comics or know of the characters. I've only gone by the movie and my very knowledgable cousin's presentation of this. Yes the dialogue was cliched but when your making blockbuster hits like these you have to be accommodating and square. I thought that parts of the last act sucked but it didn't infringe upon a good movie. And Wolverine looked anorexic to me. The character(s) that stood out the most was the Nightcrawler's and Jean's. Oh and I forgot Rouge's boyfriend Icy. I could see this movie again.,Null,0,0,2 July 2003
A Walk to Remember," Uncomfortable for a Good Reason
","One minor spoilerConsidering the junk you see in movies now-a-days, I place this one at the top of the list for anyone to watch as far as young love stories go. I was impressed with Mandy Moore's performance and the rest of the cast. The setting was impressive as well. It was overall a nice, wrapped up, predictable picture. There were however, a few flaws I found with this movie. Like others, I haven't read the book so I don't have the accuracy or the comparison to draw off from. I think that they plopped her illness in at such a bad time. It was like 'lets set these two different people together, get them to fall in love then BAM! lets make her sick so he can really appreciate her, then lets go into mush overdrive'. There wasn't any hint of her illness to me, so I felt that it could have been handled better.I found the morality of this movie a rarity but wonderful to see. I've watched this movie more than once and I feel the same unease I feel afterwards. This movie showed  me that we should treat people like bowls of water filled to the brim. Handle with care. Don't assume. Be kind. This movie was uncomfortable for a good reason.",Null,0,0,23 October 2003
Gladiator," Deserved its rating
","May be a spoiler. Gladiator was a good movie. And no one could have played Maximus' character better than Crowe. It was the fittest and finest he'd ever looked. I loved the lines at the beginning of the film when he says, 'What we do here today echoes in eternity' or something like that. What can I critique? Performances by everyone was great. The plot was adequate for the epic film and it showed a historical account of men being sold into slavery and turned into warriors for entertainment during the times of Roman rule. It was impressive and I'm not going to pretend like I'm some kind of movie critic. The movie kept me interested in its duration,and it had a moral message that I appreciate. The script was good. No stupid lines or cliched ones. The cinematography was great. Did you see that lion scene?Get a load of the beginning war scene. Scene after scene got more interesting. Now the scene stealer for the moment or the few precious moments it ran is Djimon Hounsou's character. Maximus' friend.

Its a great romantic comedy set in 1985 about a wedding singer and a waitress who are both engaged to the wrong people but made perfectly for each other.The pacing was steady and I laughed non-stop. Adam Sandler did such a good job in pulling off this wacky but believable character. All the characters as a matter of fact. The look, the hair, the clothes,the Madonna bangles, the Michael Jackson glove and leather jacket, the Don Johnson imitator, the Billy Idol cameo appearance, and the music of course.Its great when you can look back and laugh at the time.
