The Rock," Let 'The Rock' Rock You
","'The Rock'is definitely one of the most wonderful movie I've ever seen and left me a great beautiful memory. The stars' acting was really amazing. The mysterious spy wearing amazing smiles, the young chemist with a brave heart and the general who loved his country very much but had to fight against it for his soldiers. In this moving story, there was no bad guys but only patriots. Besides, the music of the Rock was the best among all the movies I've ever seen! The background music was really exciting and intense. Without Hans Zimmer's great composition, the Rock will lose 5/10 of its attraction. The Rock is the best action movie in its age and it is still one of the best in this day in spite of the rapid development of film industry. I really think this movie is underrated by we viewers. In my mind, it is an eternal classics and always worth me watching for one more time.",10,3,4,2 January 2014
