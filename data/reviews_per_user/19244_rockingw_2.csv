First Man," A great perspective

First Man," What a ride!
","This isn't your ordinary space movie. If you like human stories about achievement then you will love this. Don't listen to the unpatriotic rhetoric, I'm a veteran and I loved it. Ryan, Claire and the boys did an amazing job. The table scene will leave you speechless!",10,1,3,2 May 2019
