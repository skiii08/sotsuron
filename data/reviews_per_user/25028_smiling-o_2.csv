Walk the Line," I walked out of the theater ready to pick up a guitar....;)
","The director James Mangold did a great job with this movie. One of my favourite scenes comes toward the end, the scene showing how Johnny Cash connected with the prison audience at Folsom. Anyone enjoying Johnnys' music should pick up the new uncensored version of 'Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison'. It's great! Joaquin Phoenix was superb in his acting and truly came across as I'd imagine Johnny to. He and Reese Witherspoon both deserve awards for their performances. Their singing was great! One of the reasons I don't give this film a 10 is because they didn't use the Cash and Carter music. I'm guessing they may not have been able to get all of the music rights. But, it was still enjoyable. And, both Phoenix and Witherspoon got it right. Amazingly so.The other flaw was not showing the heartache Johnny's first wife went through. It was kind of glossed over to avoid reminding audiences of the pain he caused her. Audiences might not have walked away with as good a feeling about the man if that had been dealt with a bit more. But, I suppose being human isn't all bad. He and June were a better match. You just can't be on the road all the time and leave your wife home. It rarely works for any marriage. With this in mind, I do understand why the director chose to leave it out.Johnny's music has always made me think it is the original rap! Just with different beats and done with more class. He's had lot's of sad stories to tell and it comes across on the screen. Mangold did an exceptional job in creating Walk the Line. It wasn't boring at all.I enjoyed the film immensely and suggest it for all audiences. For the teens...there's a lesson in here on why to stay away from drugs. It's got to be a major walk down memory lane for all the baby boomer's that grew up hearing Cash and Carter music on the radio's constantly. I'm hoping it brings a resurgence in old style country back. It really is good for the soul. We all need a bit more music in our lives. And, this just reminded me of it. Johnny had a wonderful way of keeping his music real and it comes across clearly. Without all of todays vulgarity.I'm buying a guitar next week and taking up lessons. Writing music has be be better than a diary! ;) Even if no one hears it other than myself! ;)",8,0,0,7 February 2006
Shall We Dance," Wonderfully delightful movie
","This is a feel good movie that moves along at a nice pace. From start to finish, it keeps your attention. There is nothing boring about it. This movie entertains in a positive way. And, creates a desire to dance. One leaves the theatre feeling uplifted and in a good mood.More productions should be like this one. I'm always seeking good entertainment that doesn't resort to raw sex and violence. This one stands on its own with a good story. The story is believable and well shot. All of the actors do a great job and are very believable in their roles. Most importantly, it is uplifting for the soul.A must see! :)",10,1,2,4 February 2005
