The King's Speech," Truly awful
","It is impossible to take this awful, badly acted rubbish seriously in any way, not least because Colin Firth looks and sounds absolutely NOTHING like King George VI at all. In any case the story is completely unimportant since George VI was just an irrelevant figurehead without any power at all, very much like every British monarch since William IV.By starting World War II the UK destroyed itself and became an American satellite, as the Suez Crisis proved. Funny how the UK only declared war on Germany in 1939 - even though Germany and the Soviet Union both invaded Poland at the same time! Everybody knew this had been arranged in the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact in August.If they were going to make this film they should have at least cast somebody who even vaguely resembled the actual monarch. Hugh Grant turned this film down, with make up he could have been made to resemble George - unlike Colin Firth who is horrendously miscast and gives his usual talentless performance. Michael Gambon is much too heavy to play his father King George V, but at least he isn't as badly cast as the lead.It was really worth the UK starting World War II, just so it would bankrupt itself and hand over all of eastern Europe - including Poland - to the Soviets for the next 50 years. It's funny how people don't seem to realise that the Blitz happened because the RAF was bombing civilian cities in Germany.0/10.",1,13,42,21 May 2013
Vertigo," Awful garbage
","The use of colour is probably the only good thing about this slow and boring, overlong, dated film. The first half is much too long and slow and the repetitive driving scenes quickly become very tiresome. Kim Novak was always a poor actress, and looks ridiculous with her bleached platinum blond hair and thick dark eyebrows. Far too many scenes take place in the studio on very fake looking sets with painted backdrops. The opening scene is ruined because it is so fake, not that cops would be chasing a criminal over rooftops anyway. By far the worst thing however is the dreadful miscasting of Grandfather Stewart as Scottie. Stewart was clearly far too old to be playing romantic leads at this point in his career and he was actually more than twice Kim Novak's age (she was 24 and he was 49, though he looked at least 55). His grey wig is laughably bad and he just looks like an ugly old man chasing after his granddaughter. With a younger, better looking actor like Marlon Brando the film might have at least been watchable.",1,53,96,4 March 2011
The Caine Mutiny," Awful movie, Bogart was badly miscast
","Humphrey Bogart, already seriously ill with esophageal cancer caused by a lifetime of chain smoking and chronic alcoholism, was far too old to play Captain Queeq, who was only supposed to have been an officer for seven years. Aside from the awful miscasting of the lead role - which should have gone to Richard Widmark - Tom Tully also gives an awful performance and it is a real mystery how either the talentless Bogart or Tully were nominated for Oscars. Robert Francis was very bland as the young ensign and the romance was completely irrelevant. The film is so slow, dated and boring. That homophobic racist Fred Macmurray plays his usual wooden, charmless self and Van Johnson looks even uglier than he did before. Everybody in the film is far too old. How this crapfest was nominated for seven Oscars is amazing, thankfully it didn't win any.1/10 - the one and only good thing about the film is Jose Ferrer, although he doesn't appear until near the end.",1,9,40,16 May 2009
North by Northwest," Slow, dated and boring
","Cary Grant, who lived with Randolph Scott for twelve years from 1932 to 1944, was far too old at 55 to be playing the romantic lead. It's hilarious that he looks the same age as the actress playing his mother - horrendously bad casting. This movie is a slow, overlong, dated and boring and it certainly cannot be compared to any of the Bond movies. In contrast to what some other reviewers here have claimed, Grant was never offered the Bond role, because he was far too old at 58. If this rubbish had been half an hour shorter, filmed on location instead of on fake-looking studio sets, and if it hadn't been so slow then maybe it would be watchable. William Holden would have been far better as Roger Thornhill.",1,12,33,30 September 2014
Behind The Candelabra," Garbage
","Michael Douglas looks and sounds absolutely nothing like Liberace, not to mention that he is too thin for the role. In any case he is too old for the part as he was actually older at the time of filming than Liberace was when he died. However far worse is the ridiculous miscasting of a 42-year-old Matt Damon as his teenage lover! Damon cannot pass for any younger than mid-30s so it doesn't make sense that he is still supposed to be living with his foster parents in the film. They should have cast an actor in his mid-20s and then it might have been believable. Scott was only 23 when his relationship with Liberace ended, yet they cast an actor two decades older which doesn't make any sense and completely changes the dynamics of the relationship.The whole production is tacky and low-budget. I'm amazed this got a cinema release in the UK, it should have been shown on television like in the US.0/10.",1,8,32,17 June 2013
