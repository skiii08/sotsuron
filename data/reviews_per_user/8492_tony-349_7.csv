10 Cloverfield Lane," Typical low budget drama? *Spoiler*
","I've seen a lot of movies over my life. I've seen several like this one that have lots of drama and actors get to act but although the story that has promise they always failed to deliver. Not so with this movie. I was pleasantly surprised. I hope they make sequel as I would like to learn more about this story.Where can you get a big barrel of that stuff that eats bone? Ummm, I'm asking for a friend.*Spoiler* I seriously expected a half eaten away Howard to make a last grab just moments before Michelle made it into the car. Thankfully that prediction didn't happen.Turns out you can be crazy and there be aliens at the same time!",8,3,4,1 July 2016
Oblivion," Freakishly large pupils!
","I am NOT a fan of Tom Cruise. Based on the previews, and the reviews I read here I decided to go see the movie anyway. I figured if there was enough special effects and action it would obscure Tom. I'll have to admit that he did a pretty good job, still not a fan though. I guess it doesn't matter as long as I'm paying the $$$ to see the movie. ;o) So I'm wondering if anyone noticed Tom's co-worker (with benefits) freakishly large pupils? Scene after scene I saw her pupils near full dilatation and Tom's (Jack) seemed normal. It made me start to think she wasn't what she appeared to be. Alien? Cyborg? Both? This was good as I can usually figure out the plot in the movie, and things to throw me off makes the film more enjoyable.I did however figure out the majority of the plot prior to Jack meeting his twin.Even though I did really enjoy the movie, here are the problems I had with it. WTF was Sally? You're telling me that this machine intelligences did all of this for electricity? What did 'she' use it for? To build thousands of Jacks? I know the movie was 2 hours (which was fine with me) and they may have needed another 30 minutes to an hour to explain a more complex Sally, but well to me that part of the story feel a bit flat. If this is leaving an opening for a sequel it's understandable. The tet(sp?) just seemed to be a huge waste of space.My other concern was that even though they only showed two 'Jack's' how many zone were there on Earth, in other words, how many Jacks? I mean it could get busy at the lake house as each Jack remembers and finds his way there...",9,0,4,22 April 2013
The Mist," IMDb scoring let me down...
","I read the review which it was said the final 15 minutes were amazing, blah blah blah. I waited and waited, and I figured that the final 15 minutes must be after they left the relative safety of the store. I was really let down. I found the ending forced. Frankly the movie reminded me of the video game 'Doom'.The GCI was amazingly well done. If I had it to do over again, I'd watch the movie, but I'd spend $1 and rent it on DVD.My wife and I went to see this instead of 'Beowulf', or 'No Country for Old Men' Thomas Jane gave a good performance, as did Marcia Gay Harden.By the way, my wife disagrees with me, she liked the movie.",4,9,18,4 December 2007
War of the Worlds," Why I would and wouldn't go see this movie.
","Hmmmm Tom Cruise, negative! I am surprised by this choice. This alone almost caused me not to see the movie. Then I heard Tim Robbins was in it, OMG! Let me put it this way, any other director and I wouldn't have wasted my time.The story is an old one. Nothing new, at least to me. I think this was the weakest part of the movie for me.Now with that said, I will say it was a very scary movie. I put myself in the situation of being a dad with small children and what would I do in that situation.Steven Spielberg did not disappoint me with the special effects or how the story was told. It was very well done, and I was able to buy into it. I don't think I've seen a movie this scary since 'The Exorcist'.Bottom line? Tom Cruise - he did a good job, but I didn't like him in the role. Tim Robbins - Better than I expected, but I would have rather seen anyone else in the role. Movie - Stunning visual effects, good story telling, and scary.Just as we have all come to expect, Steven has done a very good job. One has to wonder why Tom Cruise was chosen though. I think a normal middle age guy would have been a better choice.Just in case you a movie mogul and you are trying to figure out why people are not going to the movies? PRICE you idiots! My wife and I went to see this movie for $15. I didn't take my children (3 of them) to see it because it would have cost TOO DAMN MUCH! I haven't seen 3 movies that I would like to have seen this summer because of the price of the ticket. I think I'm going to get a job as a critic just so I can see the movies for free. GEEZ!!!",5,1,2,5 July 2005
Hancock," Handcock not your typical hero movie.
","With movie tickets being so high these days, I like to pick a movie to take the family to see that is 'worth' it. So far we have seen Ironman, Indiana Jones, WALL-E, and Handcock.We started not to see this movie based on the bad press that people and critics have been giving it. From my perspective, they are full of crap. This was a really good movie.The movie Handcock seemed to fly by and it was over too soon. This, to me, is a mark of a good movie. It was funny, and not your typical hero story. I am hoping that Will Smith will agree to do a sequel, as I think we have more to find out about Will Smith's character, Handcock.Bateman did a very good job, and keeps his Lilly white type character (Juno), with a bit of an edge (a.k.a. Axe man).The symbol on the moon was a nice touch by the film makers, Handcock is far too homophobic to give Ray a hug and a thank you for saving his life.I hope we will see more of Handcock and Embrey characters interact in a future movie.As for the list of movies we've seen, Handcock was easily as good as Ironman, perhaps better because the story was less predictable. Certainly better than the rest in my list.",9,0,4,7 July 2008
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," How sad...
","Good movie. Sad story, very sad. Watch Star Wars after you see this one so you can feel better.I was shocked at how weak a reason that Anakin went to the dark side was.I was shocked at the reason why Padmé died. Her character was much stronger than that.OMG! Does Obi-Wan Kenobi sit on that DUST BALL until he becomes Alec Guinness? That is sad in itself.George, I have an idea. How about having a movie staring Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) being an undercover Jedi doing something other than baby sitting. You know during those 20+ years between III and IV. Poor b**tard just sitting there waiting for the next movie.",8,2,3,5 July 2005
WALL·E," Good but not Incredibles
","The Incredibles, Finding Nemo, and Monster's Inc. where better movies.The animation was beautiful, as what you would expect from Pixar.I'm glad I saw the movie but disappointed because of the prior movies from Pixar that I mentioned above.The basic problem with this movie is the lack of story, lack of action, and lack of comedy. If they are going to go 'dark' with a movie you need more story, and more character development.When WALL-E crunched that roach, his friend, it was probably the most funny part of the movie. That was 10 seconds out of what 90 minutes?The Seinfeld movie 'B Movie' was better than this one.",5,6,17,4 July 2008
