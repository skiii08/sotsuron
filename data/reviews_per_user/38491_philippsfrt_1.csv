Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," What have you done???
","Upon watching the first trailer that was released of this a while back, I have to admit that I was excited, despite the fact that Gore Verbinski was not longer directing it (he directed the first 3) and that two of my favorite characters so far, Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) and Will (Orlando Bloom) would not be returning, I allowed myself to get somewhat excited and anticipate this movie. I was gravely disappointed.My first thought half way through the movie was: OK, remove the Pirates of the Caribbean element and it could have been a decent film standing on its own, but the whole thing seems to be too forced and too stiff in the direction of Jack (Johnny Depp). It not that he plays his part badly, on the contrary, but I felt that the movie was now about Jack, rather than him being a character in the movie. I would have loved to see more of the new guy and the mermaid (you see! I don't even remember their names! Serena! That's it! And the guy? Hm.). I felt as if their story and the whole involvement of the Spanish in this went completely by everyone. They were there but the reasons to them being there were never really explained or explored. Instead we see Jack killing English soldiers by kicking plates of food at them. Seriously?The idea was good, but somehow the execution was horrible. I would have liked to like this movie, but sorry, not like this. Also as a final word: I am surprised that Jerry Bruckheimer (the Producer) would put his name on something like this as I usually believe that he is very selective and perfectionistic with the projects he takes on. Well this was just bad.OK, now this is really the final thing. In the end I felt that a sequel was somehow being set up. PLEASE don't do this. I really enjoyed the first three movies, so I hope they aren't going to turn this into one of those franchises that simply wont go away. Stop here, the damage is done, let it go.",4,2,3,22 May 2011
