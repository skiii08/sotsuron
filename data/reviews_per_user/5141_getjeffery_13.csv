Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Vol 2 answers Vol 1's questions - I was euphoric!
","It's important Kill Bill be seen as 1 movie.  Vol 1 asks questions, Vol 2 answers questions. Therefore, if you see one without the other, you'll be a measure disappointed.  I was careful to watch KB Vol 1 on DVD three times (with subtitles to catch every word) prior watching KB Vol 2.  Like others that commented, I thought KB Vol 2 was slow off the start, which is not to imply err, when the ending is pulled together so tightly and so satisfyingly as it was.  I was simply euphoric by the movie's end and felt that way through the rest of the night, pondering and tingling from the satisfaction that the movie delivered.In my view, the bloody fun that was KB Vol 1 is an 8, the satisfaction of KB Vol 2 is a 9 ... but as one movie, KB Vol 1-2 is a 10.The Bride, Uma:  I bow humbly.  Darryl Hannah is brilliantly fearsome and garners tremendous respect as the California Mountain Snake (this IS the same girl that was in Splash, isn't it?).  David Carradine, WAS Bill incarnate.SPOILER: Only in the final 10 minutes of the movie do we see just how human the Bride and Bill are. It's a familiar story--one that most all of us can relate to--only Bill and the Bride take it to the extreme ... Bill for his jealousy, the Bride for her revenge.  Finally, I thought the Bride's pleas of 'Thank-you' at the end of the movie is a very moving moment--telling that there was a higher power that got her to the place she was and she knew it.  Her narrative in Vol 1 even mentions 'God justifies her revenge, even demands it' (paraphrased). Pretty cool, eh?",8,0,1,19 April 2004
Shaun of the Dead," Creative Romantic Comedy with Zombies!
","So much fun. 'Shaun' is one of those films that you need to watch a few times to catch all the subtle comedic lines. Original comedy with lots of filming creativity, you'll find yourself rooting for Shaun very quickly.'Shaun' manages to accomplish so much ... comedy, originality, fear (had me clenching quite a few times), and romance, all wrapped in a commentary about friendship and sticking with your friends until the very end.Is there a better date movie, I don't think so. 'Shaun' will fool the guys into thinking they're watching a comedy-horror spoof, this suddenly it springs this 'romance' on you, but it's too late! You're already suckered in too and I figure a few of the 'lily-boys' might actually shed a tear of two.",9,1,2,13 March 2005
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," More interesting to watch turtles play golf.
","The official duration of this movie is 2 hours and 10 minutes. I counted at least 22. It would have been more interesting to watch turtles play golf. I had no idea what they were talking about for about 3/4 of the movie, but I did miss the second movie, so that may have something to do with it. Still, I thought the writing was very convoluted and difficult to follow. No joke, I actually nodded off about 12 times. Johnny was not quite up to normal charming self, but then again, he really didn't have that much to work with.Thank heaven though, the last quarter of the movie saved it from being quite a disaster. I think if you wake up the kids for the last 45 minutes, everyone would find at least that part of the movie quite enjoyable and interested in seeing more.",4,1,2,19 April 2008
Pitch Black," Original cinemaphotography, reminds one of Mad Max.
","I'm surprised that of all the comparisons everyone has mentioned of this movie, no one has mentioned the original Mad Max.  To me, there are a lot of similarities...both are rough, gritty, original, pretty much made you feel like you were there with them, and made you care about the characters.For the same reasons Mad Max was not a 10, this is not, but it is still a very good show that would be a great addition to your video collection.  But don't wait for the video, go see it now...most will be glad you did.  Cheers to the creators, actors, etc.  I rate it an 8 out of 10",8,0,0,21 February 2000
Van Helsing," Suspend your I.Q. and you'll have GREAT fun!
",It's okay to suspend believability.   This show is great fun when you don't argue with yourself over whether Beckinsale falling down a tree would break her back (or a hundred other examples).  Sure it's unreal.  But it's okay to be unreal in movies if it's backed up with good fun.   Helsing is action from start to finish.  It had the potential to be a GREAT movie if they had spent a little more time on the monsters and the filming.   Monsters were sometimes over-the-top and sometimes things just moved TOO fast or were a little too hokey.I liked it.  I gave it an 8.,7,0,1,26 May 2004
Enchanted," I can't get the smile off my face!
","It's a fun movie with a screenplay, acting, and score that stands on its own, but it is Amy Adams' performance that will make your heart soar! The way she makes a simple gesture such as a subtle tilt of her pinkie, the way she leans forward to whisper to a chipmunk or dove, the way she sings, the glowing innocence in her eyes -- will all set you in awe at how perfectly she becomes the quintessential Disney princess. Even to watch her walk is an elegant ballet of poise and grace only previously seen in a Disney-animated princess. You will swear that you are looking at Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella, and Snow White all rolled into one.You will fall in love. You'll smile for hours. You may tear up. You'll laugh. You will be completely Enchanted.",9,3,4,8 December 2007
The Princess Bride," Timeless ...
","Watch it with your love, Watch it with your children, Watch it with your grandchildren. The DVD's commentaries and documentaries are especially rewarding.",10,0,1,17 July 2003
28 Days Later...," Thought-provoking, scary--better every time I see it.
","On par with Silence of the Lambs.  This film is full of irony, thought-provoking dialog, characters that you really become involved with, and surprising realism given the subject-matter.  You care about the 4-5 main characters, they have personalities and dialog that makes them unique.This show is great.",8,0,0,5 August 2003
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," the glowing reviews are true!
","I am not a fan of martial arts and heavens knows I enjoy sub-textlike I enjoy trips to the dentist, but this movie will take you to placesyou have never been.  I think it is overall, simply the best movie Ihave seen in my 36 years.I was a serious skeptic going into the movie for the reasons Ilisted above, and at the beginning of the movie I found myselfbeing critical of the 'flying' scenes because the momentum wasn'tquite right.  But by the end of the movie, I realized how petty thatwas of me, given the depth and beauty of the movie as a whole.  Itis not a film, it is an experience that will truly touch you.",9,0,0,8 February 2001
Stalingrad," An embarrassment.
","This movie is a slap in the face to Russia.  The entire movie is from the perspective of a few German soldiers in the hands of war.  The film portrayed these men as simply doing their duty and at first proud of their rape of Russia but by the end of the film, they were crying to go home.  The film's dark success was that by its end, I found myself feeling somewhat sorry for these men, which were feelings that were not welcome.  I will never watch this film again. If you are one that is not so offended by sympathy to the plight of German aggression, you will still not find this film rewarding.  The history was weak and the pace somewhat dull.  It is not a bad war movie, it is simply 'average' and in very poor taste.",Null,1,10,5 November 2000
The Matrix Reloaded," More fun than a barrel of cheerleaders!
","I came into the theatre expecting a gut-wrenching cliff-hanger at the end. In my opinion, the cliff-hanger wasn't that bad--I was PLEASED.  There were many places that would have been more gut-wrenching.  Expect to need to see the movie a few times to catch the detail--just as the original required.One frustration point--what the heck is up with the drums and dancing around like little banchies in Zion? (no offense to banchies meant).  Same scene, different movie title (Gangs of NY).Reloaded is a great movie though.  One of those that had me playing it over in my mind for a few hours afterwards.",7,0,0,16 May 2003
Enemy at the Gates," Suspenseful eye-opener
","As a card-carrying arrogant American, it was humbling to bereminded that we were not the only ones fighting WWII.  This is agripping, class, movie.Thank-you to the creators.Jeffery",10,1,2,25 April 2001
Contact," A rich film I learn from every time I watch it.
","To me, this is an amazing film and one of my top two or three. Those with blinders on thinking it is only a space movie will miss the point entirely.  The movie is about patience, persistence, passion, truth, conflict, faith, beauty and evil of humanity, love, God, science, space, and more.  I have never learned more from a movie...and I'm 35 years old.I also recommend the DVD.  It includes audio commentaries by Foster, Zemeckis, and the FX guys.  Don't tell anyone, but this $19.99 DVD is worth well over $100.  It's like four movies",10,0,1,22 February 2000
