The Blair Witch Project," Proof that marketing works
","I will say that there are a couple of classic moments in this flick.  Blair Witch is original in marketing, not in filmmaking, and is not good.  Those who actually believe this is a good example of a well-done horror movie should start looking in the classics section at Blockbuster.  You have been sucked into Artisan's marketing.  Three-quarters of Blair Witch features losers yelling at each other in the woods.  That's just annoying, not scary.For great horror, check out ROSEMARY'S BABY, THE EXORCIST, THE OMEN, PSYCHO, THE THING, or INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS.   Even DEVIL DOG: THE HOUND OF HELL was better.",3,0,1,4 June 2000
Fight Club," Good, not great [8/10]
","Like all David Fincher movies, Fight Club is very pretty.  Seven demanded that it be seen on film at least once.  I think Fight Club, which also looks like it was processed with ENR, is in the same category.  There are some incredible, unexpected effects in this movie as well.  Definitely check out the super-macro-lens effects.About halfway through, I thought Fight Club would be a 10/10 -- and then it suddenly grinds to a halt.  Almost all movies are too long and this is no exception.  I would bet that about half-an-hour could be easily cut from this movie.  The end result is interesting, but it just didn't seem to work. It may that things didn't translate well from the book... I'll have to read it to find out.I think that Fincher has learned a lot with respect to directing actors.  I walked out of Seven asking myself if that was really Morgan Freeman on the screen or some impostor.  The Game was saved by the overwhelming talent/personality of Sean Penn and Michael Douglas, especially Penn, who is a genius.  In Fight Club, Pitt was good and his comic timing was definitely on.  But, I'm convinced that Pitt's best role will always be the stoner in True Romance.  Norton, whose performance in Primal Fear blew me away, was just kind of blah here.  Meat Loaf played a really nice character.Anyway, do see it.  You'll either like it or hate it, which is usually a sign of a good movie.",10,0,1,17 October 1999
Spice World," Oh come on... it's fun!
","You complainers are no fun.  This flick is pure entertainment. I laughed out loud many times.  I was a Spice Girl hater as well, but I had a blast watching Spice World.",8,1,2,1 August 1999
The Thin Red Line," This one is polarizing.. and I take the south pole
","Someone else commented that people either love or hate this movie.  I agree that that is the case, except I cannot understand for a millisecond how anyone could love this movie.  If you think, based on Fox's marketing prowess, that this is a war movie, you have been lied to.  It is a nature documentary.  It is bad poetry dubbed over a bunch of second unit stuff. It is literally twice as long as it should be, with a small fraction of that time devoted to a battle scenes.If you want to see a great war movie that is also cerebral, see Apocalypse Now.  This one misses the mark on both points.",3,0,0,1 June 1999
