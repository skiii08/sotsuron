Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Very disappointing - nothing brilliant about it.
","Major spoilers. Don't read unless you've seen.I think we need to take a step back and look at some of the reaction to this film. This movie wasn't that good a movie. It wasn't bad - I liked it, but it wasn't nearly as groundbreaking or brilliant or marvelous as everyone seems to think. Characterization is inconsistent with what we saw in Vol. 1, and if this 'expanded mythos' that Tarantino is so proud of gave reasons for these inconsistencies, then we should know them from watching the movie, not having to buy the book, the special extended DVD edition, or the super-mega-amazing director's cut collector's edition.It seems that people just assume that Tarantino strikes gold every time he does ANYTHING, so they rant and rave about how much of a genius he is no matter what he does. Rather than answer a good deal of questions we had in Vol. 1, Vol. 2 just gave us a bunch of new questions - the answers to which were less than satisfactory. And Taranino's talent for dropping subtle hints is completely lost upon this plot. Rather than gentle foreshadowing, he beats us over the head, repeatedly, which makes certain aspects of the story VERY predictable. They basically told us how Bill would die about halfway through the movie, and told us how Elle lost her eye before they told us. Then, when the movie confirms these battering-ram foreshadows, it treats it like we'e supposed to be surprised?Every single aspect of this film was a disappointment. Let's go over a few.As I'm sure you all recall, in Vol. 1, the name of the Bride was bleeped out, and this continues through the first portion of the film. However, when her real name is revealed, it means nothing. Which makes you wonder why he ever bleeped it out in the first place. And if the answer is 'just because,' then why did he tell us her name at all? At least, in the fashion we were given. It was pointless. I could understand if we never found out her name until it was listed on the closing credits, but this was just stupid.Now, character inconsistencies. In the first film, we are told that Elle hates the Bride. Fair enough. But, she is also willing to kill the Bride by poisoning her in her sleep, and flips out when she's ordered not to. But, in this film, she kills Budd, and her reason for doing so is, she says, because Budd managed to kill her. And this is, let's remember, after she told him to. Now, I wouldn't put killing Budd past Elle for a second, but I think if anything, it should've been for the money. She's proven, and continues to prove in Vol. 2, that she cares little for honour and the warrior code. So then why this sudden spark of sympathy?And then there's Budd. All we know about him is that he's a hick. That's pretty much all we're given to work with. Every part of his character helps to reiterate this. That was done well enough, but for one thing - why did he keep the sword? Or at the very least, why would he lie to Bill and Elle about it? Now, I argued this with a friend, and she thought that it was because Budd loves Bill, but didn't want to show any sentimentality. While that does make a certain degree of sense, there's still the matter of what we're given. Until Vol. 2, we didn't even know that they WERE brothers, and their relationship is not at all elaborated on through the course of this film. I saw no actual evidence of why Budd would do something like this. Now, Tarantino professes that he made up elaborate backstories for all these characters to make their motivation more apparent to the actors, but here, it seems to have been a curse as opposed to a blessing. There can be a huge story behind these characters, but if it stays behind them, we never see it. Their actions were sloppy and pointless. And I really can't see Budd as anything but a hick, which makes we wonder if he was ever actually an assassin at all. I mean, it's only been four years, and he's just completely degenerated?Onto Bill. Wow. I never realized just how crappy an actor David Carradine actually was. Everything is hokey and overdramatic. Now, I thought that this was supposed to be an homage to the chop-sockey, kung-fu media of old. Because he'd be great there. But he's stagnant and embarassing in any semblance of a dramatic environment. And the Bride, at this point, just killed O-Ren, who, we're told, he invested a lot in, Budd (he thinks she did, anyway), his brother, the only man he ever loved, and Elle, his (unless I misunderstood) current lover. But he never even brings that up. It doesn't seem to phase him, and yet, we're supposed to believe that he'd react to the Bride's leaving him the way he did. Even NOW, the only reason he seems at all upset with her is that she left him.Pai Mei was my favourite part of the movie. The aged mentor character was true to form, complete with the all-consuming superiority complex and twisted humour at his pupil's failures. But he just seemed forced into the plot for no real reason. We got very little insight into his relationship with the Bride. When Elle announces that she murdered him, I wasn't sure if the Bride cared or not. Additionally, we're told, and are given no reason to believe otherwise, that Pai Mei is over a thousand years old. Given the stuff we've been given, that strikes me as a stretching our suspension of belief rather thin, and it just came out of nowhere. And THEN, there's also the matter that he's a kung-fu master, he's 1000 years old, and yet, Elle managed to kill him.And finally, the Bride herself. Now, if I'm an experienced assassin, do Ijust answer the door when I'm on assignment? If she hadn't dropped her pregnancy test, she would've been killed. So, it was luck. How the hell did she survive all this time if she makes such stupid mistakes? Let's remember that she's a former member of the Deadly Vipers, which means that she kills people for money. But we're never showed that. We're only showed the sins of the other five, as if Tarantino's afraid that we might lose faith in the Bride if she was portrayed as a ruthless assassin like O-Ren or Elle. But it would be more interesting if this baby actually CHANGED something. Instead, we're never shown the Black Mamba. We're only shown the Bride. Or, the happy-go-lucky student of Bill.And the fights all sucked. The Budd fight didn't happen. The Elle fight was pretty intense, but too short, and what a crappy ending (and also, they're jumping up and around a trailer with a friggin black mamba somewhere in it, and it never comes up, and they don't seem to notice, and through it all, the Bride had bare feet). The Bill fight was probably twenty seconds long, and I'd seen half of it in trailers already. They never even stood up for it. For whole course of this friggin' movie, NO ONE GOT CUT WITH A SWORD. Probably one of the better fights was the one with Karen.
And then, there's a lot of carryovers from the first film that, now that you've seen the second, make no sense. Like, Sofie Fatale. The way they show the Two Pines Massacre, there was no possible way for Sofie to be in the chapel at the time, and there doesn't seem to be much reason, either.
And then there's Vernita Green. Now, give me a moment: The Bride wakes up in Texas. She hitches a ride to Okinawa, gets a sword made, then goes to Tokyo, uses the sword on O-Ren, travels to Pasadena, does NOT use the sword, and then goes back to Texas.It almost seems like the movie was written to have Vernita killed FIRST. Especially since she loses the Pussy Wagon - which no one has seen and lived to tell about, yet Estoban somehow knows about it - apparently after that fight, and she GOT the Pussy Wagon when she killed Buck in Texas. Then, after killing Vernita, she went to Japan. This also makes more sense as she didn't have (or at least didn't use) the sword in the Vernita encounter. The movie just seems full of sloppy writing.Now, this is just a personal nitpick, but I'll mention it anyway. This movie is a self-proclaimed homage to chop-sockey kung-fu crap, right? Well, then why not actually pay homage to it? This is a very staple archetype - you start off with the easy minions, and then work your way up to the most trying battle of the film. Yet, the Bride started off her revenge quest at the House of Blue Leave, where she single-handedly fought off hordes of supposedly skilled assassins, Johnny Mo, Go-go, and finally, she fought O-Ren while she was utterly exhausted. The Vernita fight wasn't nearly as taxing, though it was pretty intense. At least she got cut. Then, Elle took care of Budd for her, and Elle, like I said, never actually draws blood from the Bride. And then, the Bill fight was super-short and seemingly effortless on the part of the Bride. It seemed too easy for her.Now, I liked it in spite of all this. I would recommend anyone to see it, but I don't think that anyone's redefining genres or whatever the crap all the critics are calling it. And Tarantino's making a mint off of this. He's announced plans to spin it off into a novel, he wants to rerelease it in theatres as a single movie, and he wants to make multiple special DVD editions, as well as multiple individual supplement discs. And, he also wants to make a Vol. 3 in fifteen years about Vernita's daughter Nikki coming after the Bride.Tarantino already thinks he's god, so I fear that he's going to go the way of Lucas very very soon. I think another innovative filmmaker is about to bite the dust.",Null,4,6,18 April 2004
Underworld," Not Good At All
","*Minor Spoilers - don't worry, you spot them coming a mile away*Some of the fights were decent. The morphing thing on the werewolves was good. The costumes were interesting, if not a tad redundant, and the setting kept very gothic and fitting for most of the film.That is where the virtues of this film end.We have been waiting almost ten years for another decent vampire movie, and we keep getting cliched disappointment after another. Vampire culture barely factored into it. We hardly see them demonstrate any of their powers. This could very easily be about human werewolf-hunters, and the plot would need only a little tweaking. That aside, the plot was still quite bad. The avenging-murdered-family bit is getting very old and very tired and it's pulled off in uncreative enough a way not to give them the benefit of the doubt.When Selene (Beckinsale) and Mike (Speedman) inevitably fall in love, you begin to wonder why, as nothing has really happened that merits any feelings for one another. Their first kiss comes from out of nowhere. I realize this is primarily an action movie but let's put SOMETHING behind the relationships.That being said, the action sequences that were rewarding to watch were few and far between, and none of them involved Selene. Kate Beckinsale seems very out of place in a fight. And in the final battle, the death of the big bad guy is actually very comical, and the cinema I was in burst into laughter when he died, which I somehow doubt was the intent.
And finally, as a horror film, it doesn't even try to scare you. I can't see it being considered a horror film in any serious capacity.And as a detail, why didn't we just call them 'Werewolves' instead of 'Lycans' which sounds exactly like 'Lichens.'",1,25,53,2 October 2003
Batman Returns," Best Batman
","The best thing about Batman Returns is that, when you watch it, you manage to forget how much Joel Schumacher has destroyed the franchise. Batman Returns takes these famous characters and explores them deeply and disturbingly. What Burton started in Batman, he continues in this wildly stylistic sequel.Though in terms of writing and acting, the greatest success is celebrated by the villains. In Catwoman, we see Michelle Pfeiffer transform from a twitchy, nervous, and undertrod secretary into a dark, confident psychopath. Pfeiffer's performance in Returns is one of the most unsung in the history of film. We see her degenerate from scene to scene, slowly losing control, until the breaking point at the climax.Then there's the Penguin, bent on revenge against all the silver spooners who thrived where his parents abandoned him. His interaction with society can be easily compared to that of Edward Scissorhands. When they first recieve him, the city is thrilled at the novelty of his otherness, but they turn on him in an instant. The only difference is that the Penguin deserves it. In the end, he's abandoned once again, by the city, by his co-conspirators, and finally, by his avian minions themselves.Batman Returns takes what could have easily just been another pop culture action film and turns it into a twisted reflection on some very disturbed characters. Gotham City, under the direction of Burton, remains dark and gothic, unstained by the neon and blacklights that Schumacher would later invade it with.Returns is, and probably will always be, the last Batman movie to stay true to what Batman was truly about, a dark man, in a dark city, trying to find the light.",10,3,8,24 February 2004
Troy," Could Have Been Brilliant
","SpoilersHaving been intimately familiar with the legends this was based off of, it's not unfair to say that I was a very biased audience. And even having seen it, I really think that it blew its potential. The discrepencies between the myth and this movie were needless, and didn't add to the plot. To me, it seemed as though Petersen was cutting corners to make a story that was easier to translate into film, fulfilling tropes and archetypes rather than take some initiative and tell it the way it could have been told. The deaths of Menelaus and Agamemnon in particular seemed to be thrown in just to give the audience some moral satisfaction, that they got what was coming to them. Meanwhile, in the myth, Helen goes back with Menelaus, and Agamemnon takes Priam's youngest daughter as a concubine and returns home (to be murdered by his vexed wife, but that's entirely another story).At the end, I felt like this movie should have been bigger than it was. Just in depth and production, this didn't seem like it was that big a deal. It was just another movie. The script was choppy and hammy, and everything seemed rushed to make a war that was supposed to last twenty years into a movie that lasted a little over two hours. The complete exclusion of anything supernatural also hurt this film, I believe. And if they keep that philosophy for the might-happen sequel of the Oddessey, I don't think it will be even remotely recognizable. But even if I set aside the knowledge I had going into this film, I don't think it was that good. With the exception of Eric Bana, Rose Bryne, Saffron Burrows (I know, I was surprised too) and Brendon Gleeson, everyone just seemed to be trying too hard and not pulling it off. The action sequences weren't exactly innovative, and I think should've been considerably more graphic. I mean, all the characters are going on about how horrible the war is, but then we get this toned-down version of Gladiator to support that? Doesn't really add up for me, anyway.",Null,0,1,23 May 2004
Van Helsing," The Newest Trend?
","This isn't a review of this particular movie. I thought it profoundly mindless, but fun enough to make up for it. I think the CG was a tad overused, and didn't look all that good most of the time. I was particularly unimpressed with the Dracula creature. But that's pretty much all I have to say about it. It was harmless. Not good enough to leave any lasting impression, but not bad enough to make me care enough to hate it.But I just can't get over this crossover trend that was set with League of Extraordinary Gentlemen last year. There have been several movies since that throw a bunch of characters from different franchises into the mix. Even though the Alamo is supposed to be a historical docudrama or whatever, it seemed strange to see Jim Bowie and Davey Crockett in the same story. So count that one, or don't, if you wish. Freddie vs. Jason pitted the two famed slasher movie icons against each other, and Alien vs Predator does the same with the equally iconic sci/fi monsters.All right, two in one, that's not that bad. League of Extraordinary Gentlemen was just ridiculous, of course, with dozens of literary sources mangled in a shredder and thrown together, barely stitched together to form what some might consider a moderately coherent plot. We've got, like, ten different books colliding in this movie. Apart from the League itself, there were further references to others, including Sherlock Holmes.But that one we can let go, because it's based on an old comic or whatever. Fine. The movie was bad enough on it's own.Van Helsing, however, does this so overtly and so needlessly that you really have to wonder what anyone was thinking. It's the League of Extraordinary Universal Monsters. If you haven't seen the movie, you likely already know that it features Dracula, Frankenstein's monster, and the Wolf Man. However, it also feature's Mr. Hyde in a utterly unnecessary preamble. And not only does this seem out of place in the company of these classic monsters, but it's hinted that Hyde is also the Hunchback of Notre Dame, AND Jack the Ripper. These references just seem thrown in for the sake of throwing them in.I seriously don't know what the hell they can do with the sequel you know they're going to make, unless it's just the same movie over again, with all the dead villains either coming back or turning out not to have died. Maybe we'll get computer-animated flashbacks to enlighten us.I swear to God, Bram Stoker must be wishing he could rise from the grave and wreak his terrible, vampiric revenge upon all the different bastardizations of EVERY possible character he created. Dracula's been done to death, of course. The League butchered Mina Murray, and now Van Helsing has turned its titular character into something that barely resembles the guy we met in the book. Should we expect 'Jonathan Harker' coming in 2005? Starring Keanu Reeves as an vampire hunter who engages hordes of identical undead in slow-motion kung-fu brawls? Or, better yet, 'Westernra' starring - oh, I don't know, Drew Barrymore, let's say - as Lucy Westernra, turned vampire, but kept her soul or something, and so uses her supernatural undead powers and sex appeal to fight evil. It'll be like 'Angel,' except she's a chick.You might laugh or roll your eyes, but if Van Helsing has been any indication, we are not that far off.Maybe Somers thought this would be a dud, and so tried to cram in every monster he could find because he didn't think he'd get another chance. Or maybe he has a terminal illness or something. Because this is what he loves doing - taking classic, iconic figures and revisiting them in new and occasionally moderately interesting ways.Unfortunately, Van Helsing was NOT one of those occasions.Well, what do you know, I guess this sort of WAS a review of the movie.",Null,0,0,8 May 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," A Missed Opportunity
","If any other name had been attached to this movie, it wouldn't have gone through because no one would let it. Tarantino has been awarded every freedom to indulge himself, and dear god, he uses every last one.The movie is drenched in style. It's loaded with very impressive cinematography and art direction, and it's well directed for what it was going for. But I find the major disappointment to be with the writing. Particularly the dialogue. The story was very good, but almost all conversations between characters were just horrible. The Bride & Vernita's conversation in the kitchen was just embarrassing to listen to. Their lines were so cliched that it must have been impossible to say them with any passion without hamming it up, so they hammed it up.The blood spewing from every open wound was also a little overdone, and just looked fake. Even without knowing the physical problems with it, the blood didn't look good in almost every fight scene. I mean, if you're going to have THAT much blood in a single movie, I'd take steps to see to it that the blood actually looks decent.And then, there were a lot of scenes, or, at least, shots, that were too long, and pointless. They added nothing to the film, and if it was any other director, would've been on the cutting room floor. Unless Vol. 2 is substantially different, this movie did NOT have to be cut in two.WHile it's certainly worth seeing, it's not nearly Tarantino's best, nor is it worthy of all the praise it's been getting. There are way too many instances where useless content or ridiculousness was just shrugged off with, 'Well, it's Tarantino.'",7,0,1,28 February 2004
Shrek," This Could Change the World
","I'm not kidding. This is one of the very few fairy tale movies to actually practice the themes that it preaches. At the end of the movie, the story establishes that people don't need to be 'beautiful' in the traditional sense of the word, but whereas other fairy tales fall short, and give some excuse to turn them both into rich supermodels, instead, Fiona continues to be an ogre, and the story ends on a 'happily ever after' note with them still living in a swamp.Now, let's take a Disney movie as a contrasting example. Like, Aladdin. So at the end, the moral of the story is that Aladdin was a diamond in the rough despite being at the bottom of the social class barrel. But to live happily ever after, he needs to become a Prince.Shrek is of course renowned for its amazing visuals, which it certainly has in large supply. While the animation is superb with every character, I was especially impressed with Fiona, who was the most life-like among them, and certainly would give Aki Ross a run for her money. But along with all the visuals is an interesting story, dynamic and original character who manage to fit into the loose, generic roles associated with the genre (hero, damsel, sidekick) while defying the archetypes that usually tie such characters down. I was especially delighted to see the guardian dragon actually become a character and not just a story vehicle.As the result, we end up with an interesting, visually stunning, and wholly entertaining twist on the stereotypical fairy tale. One of the best movies of the year, and I fully believe that it should've been nominated for best picture. Unfortunately, the Academy, being so terrified of computer animation as they are, created the 'Best Animated Feature' sub award so that they could take all animated films out of the running for best picture.",Null,1,2,26 April 2004
Sin City," To All the Haters
","SPOILERS AHEAD I can't say I'm surprised to see both the amount of people in love with this film and the amount of people who think it deplorable. But I'd like to address some of the comments I've seen.First, I loved this film. I think it's the first film in a long time that has done something truly unique that works. I'm glad that it was so uncompromisingly faithful to the comic. Now, obviously, I'm not going to take the position that everyone has to like this film. But I think that some things have been unfairly stated about this film, and I'd like to address them.The image of women in this movie has come up repeatedly. It's accused of being maliciously sexist, and unfairly so. I agree that no respectable women are in this film, and I agree that they are stereotypical, comic-book knockouts. But that doesn't make this movie sexist, and the reason that's so, is because it treats men EXACTLY the same way. There are no male role models in this film, either. Though some characters may have good intentions, they're all despicably ruthless. Marv may be out on a righteous revenge quest, but does that merit cutting off a man's arms and legs and leaving him for a bloodthirsty dog? You want to tell me that tearing the genitalia off the same man TWICE is something people should emulate? No character can justify their actions in any rational manner. Similarly, all the male characters are muscle-bound supermen. They are not striving for realism or accurate depictions of how people look or act. EVERYONE here is a fantasy, not just the women.In fact, the most sympathetic characters in the entire movie are Lucille and Nancy. That they're open with their sexuality doesn't take away from the fact that they're both good, strong people, nor does the fact that they're both victims. Lucille does the right thing. It gets her killed, but it's still one of the most moral decisions anyone in the film makes. On top of that, the character with the highest body count is likely Miho, and she's presented as, by far, the most skilled combatant among the cast. So, it makes me wonder how one can claim that this movie is unfair to women. And if you expect women to be cast as moral, righteous people ONLY because they're women, then I'd say that a rather sexist expectation to go into a movie with.I'm confused when I hear people say that it glorifies violence against women. The men guilty of crimes against women in this film meet with such gruesome and torturous fates that I'm very hesitant to call them glorified.So of course, there's the overwhelming violence. I agree, this is probably the most explicitly violent movie out there. These 'heroes' don't get revenge by killing their opponents, they get revenge by torturing them to death. Everyone is shamelessly ruthless, and the authors had to in turn make their villains so disgustingly horrific that we can tolerate the amount of punishment inflicted upon them when their pursuers finally catch up with them. Kevin couldn't just have killed Goldie. He made Lucille watch as he ate her hand, and displays the heads of the other girls he killed and ate as hunting trophies on his wall. Only now can we, the audience, allow Marv to quarter him and leave him to be eaten alive.And that's what this movie's about. There IS meaning and poignancy underneath all the blood and gore. I won't blame anyone for being overwhelmed. The only reason this movie is bearable is because of the unique comic-booky perspective we see it from. The high-contrast black and white, with splashes of colour in a pair of bright red sneakers, piercing blue eyes, golden stream of urine, or that yellow bastard, makes it surreal. The most intense scenes are depicted in inverse silhouettes.Which brings me to the argument of style and substance, which comes up whenever a highly stylistic movie comes out. That it involves a style no one's ever seen before leaves it open for the easy-to-make accusation that that's all there is to it. But the style and content of Sin City work together. Both are nothing without the other. If this was shot like every other movie, the story would be overwhelming for even the strongest stomachs. And if the story told was the same as every detective revenge story, the style would be pointless. But here, they act together to make one of the few truly unique movies in years.If you don't like it, fine. But this IS a good movie.",10,1,3,17 April 2005
