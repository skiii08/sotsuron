Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Mean Spirited 'humor'
","There is nothing new about this movie - it's been tried and done before in 'punked' -- only this movie is NEVER meant to let the objects of the prank in on the joke(s). There is nothing else really to say about it other than that it is just plain MEAN spirited. The fact that almost 40% of the respondents gave this movie a 10 explains why many people today are just plain rude.The only thing good is, I got it from one of the online DVD rental companies so it really didn't cost me much other than the 86 minutes I wasted watching it.there are only a couple of scenes where the 'bigotry' or 'ignorance' of the objects of the skit are pointed out. Most times, as I said, it's just being MEAN to the objects of the skit.I moved it to the top of my rental queue based on some of the BAD reviews here, figuring the posters were just old 'fuddy duddys' with no sense of humor. Well, I happen to have a great sense of humor and found very little in this movie.",1,6,13,11 May 2007
