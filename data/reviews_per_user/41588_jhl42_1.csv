Hereditary," Bad movie
",Possibly one of the worst films I have ever seen! It was not scary at all. Sorry to see such good actors (Collette and Burn Executive Producers!) waste their talents. Watching this film made me want to go back and watch A Quiet Place again! ....or The Conjuring which really did scare me. That was a good film.,2,1,3,31 December 2018
