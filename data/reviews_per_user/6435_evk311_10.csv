Whip It," an interesting look in the life of people
","i liked it , because the movie gives you a chance too look in the live of people , we get a chance to see how people live in this area.it was very believable and very real. a kid growing up in a place that is not even on the map,falling in love with some dude , she is trying to be happy and find it in a new hobby with roller skating. people from the neighborhood come together in illegal warehouses to enjoy roller skate matches by girls. they are happy with this live and don't know anything better. i think it was very interesting. it all looks so unimportant to us , but for them it was a way to escape their miserable life in the middle of nowhere in Texas. acting was pretty good, when she was sad and lovesick and try to get her old life back , that was a strong point in the movie. further there was a small technical mistake in the movie , in the middle of the movie somewhere there was a bad edit cut. you are looking to a scene from a night shot, and the next second the movie skips to a scene in the day shot , without a smooth end from the shot before . i was like ; uh what was that ? some bad edit work in studio ? maybe it was just me seeing mistakes like this.other bad points in the movie ; the race looked in slow motion almost. she looked really slow when rolling on the floor.nice thing was to see other famous actors in this movie. brother from Owen Wilson , the girl from dusk till dawn , etc. all together it was a little cheap , but i still liked it .this movie is fun to watch. and if you like Juno , you cannot miss out on this one. that was clever step from the producer. but Juno was much better.",7,0,3,31 March 2010
The Monuments Men," i can imagine people walking out of the theater during this movie.
","big names ? that must be a good movie? but after one hour i was still bored. watching this at home. thinking about the people that payed for a ticket to see this movie.and expecting to be entertained. i still have to see the last 20 minutes sometimes this week or anytime. but i don't expect to be thrilled anymore by this movie.also what is irritating me in this movie is that they keep playing that same melody every 5 minutes.repeating that theme melody over and over again, in all kinds of styles and moods. how cute and genius ? or how irritating and unoriginal. in full orchestra, that melody plays, and next moment they play it in soft different instruments . and then in some minutes again. they play again that same melody in another style. in the background. the melody keeps coming back repeating itself , i can not hear it anymore , it is too often. the TV industry used to do this repeating melody trick for shows like the A-team in the eighties. but for a big 2014 cinema movie ? it seems a kind of cheap to me.if you are a die hard fan of these big actor names and want to see every second they ever played in their life , than you could enjoy this movie and have it in your done list. otherwise i don't see what makes this movie so exciting. the story is some kind of weak in my opinion. not much happening. i might not even go see the last part of it. there are better movies to spend time watching on it. a true story does not mean not a boring story. only good point was to see how people lived in that time. interesting to watch. but still boring.",3,1,1,13 October 2014
Source Code," yes of course it is fake , that is called : a movie
","it is hilarious how some reviewers are explaining that this dead experience coming back to life is not possible and so crappy . well yes of course it is not possible that is why it is a movie , and things happen there which is actually never possible in real life. DUUUHHH. if we start talking like that ,we could say ;hey spiderman movies are crap , because that would never be possible in real life. so anyone commenting that this movie is crap because it is impossible in real life , obviously they didn't get the point of the story and film. yes it is a story and a movie and it goes far and deep and it is not possible in real life , just like spider man or x-man movies and wolverine etc etc. so don't you think it is kind of stupid and childish to say that this movie is rubbish because it doesn't make sense ? well . then go review superman or just any scifi , and tell us all that it is rubbish because it is not possible . what about Donald the talking duck ? that is not possible either , so is that rubbish ? OMG get a life haha i think this movie had a great story and a great plot , and was interesting to watch till the end. just use your imagination and enjoy the ride. i had a great time watching this one.i would recommend it.",8,0,1,30 June 2011
United 93," from all horrormovies i have seen , this one topped that above!
","OK , what can i say , everything seemed to be said already here before. the movie was on TV this week. i didn't want to see this movie at start , but decided to give it 5 or 10 minutes. i found out that the movie took my attention and i could not switch it of anymore.it was very real to see, and i did that trip myself so many times every year. it could have been me in the movie. but still the movie was easy to watch, just until the last 15 minutes. the beautiful and nice people in the plane all changed their minds into animals and horror monsters and fighted for the last seconds in their life.i have seen fight scenes and horror movies, but nothing like those last 15 minutes.it could have been everyone here from us.very catching.",Null,1,1,12 September 2011
The Illusionist," everything is great about this movie , ignore the hate reviews
","this IMDb review page is so much confusing sometimes , it doesn't make sense in many cases. just pick any masterpiece of a movie and you will always see a handful of haters who thought it sucks so bad and that movie was so awful. that is the case here with this movie , i thought it was a wonderful movie, i loved everything about it . the actors , the story , the background from the old century. the plot was great. yes i had a great time seeing this movie . i ignored the few bad IMDb reviews , they said to not go see this movie and waist your time. well keep that advice for yourself next time , and to everyone i would say go see this movie and judge for yourself. if you like the actors , and the subject , and like to see how people lived in that century , you will enjoy this movie a lot. but if you don't have an open mind for many things and hate a lot of things in life , maybe you should not even do anything to get entertained, and keep hating everything. Edward Norton is a great actor that plays in good movies , that should say enough... if you don't like a movie , maybe it says more about yourself...because i don't get it how a great movie can receive such bad reviews.",9,0,0,6 June 2011
The Hangover Part II," trying to be funny is often not so funny
","this is the third but not the best one. it feels like they were trying to look for funny jokes , but it looked cheap. some mistakes in the script as well.. they found chow in Mexico , and before they left his house he killed all of his roosters. what has that to do with the movie? i don't see the funny part of that . it did not tell anything to the story. just a random scene that could have been cut out of the movie.the car accident with the zoo giraffe in traffic was also a kind of weird humor. making up all weird jokes and put it all together to a movie in random order is not really funny in my opinion. and what about Phil? he was successful to break a stone wall with a sledgehammer , but he could not break a wooden door when he got locked up ? weak storyline. there were some nice moments, but all together it was nowhere close to part 1 and 2 .",4,0,0,14 October 2014
Blood Diamond," masterpiece
","this IMDb review section for members is hilarious, a great masterpiece movie like this here, gets positive and also destroying reviews. so you will never be able to find out in this way if a movie works for you , until you see it yourself. i think it is funny to read how some reviewers say this movie was really bad. i could understand if it was bad , but it probably had to do with their taste. this movie was farrrrr from bad.four years after release i finally took time to see it , it was on my list for a while , i didn't expect such a masterpiece, Leonardo DI Caprio is playing in pretty good movies here and there , but for sure this is one of his remarkable works. what touched me was the idea that it all was reality and not some kind of fiction from some writer. i am sorry for the people that died in this story , i really felt that it all actually happened.i mean: in some other police story , people die as well , but you know it's all fake. in this story you know it really happened just like they showed you. lucky this movie is not just about the people who died but also about love , destiny and luck and so much more. the locations are incredible , it shows you a good picture of the real life in that continent . very interesting. often the endings are weak in other movies , but i can say the end in this story is a masterpiece. it goes as far as i would have like to see. a real end . in other movies they leave you with questions and it suddenly stops. that could be nice as well , but in this one everything get said and done. a real end .i was not planning to buy a diamond , but after this movie i know for sure that i will never buy a diamond in my life , now i know the story behind it . of course not all diamonds came this way ... but you never know if some kid lost his hand for your diamond ...and also the cast is great , this movie will go in my top 10 all timesi recommend this movie , but be aware for extreme violence against humanity",10,1,2,3 September 2010
Jack Reacher," Now that is what i call a great movie !
","WOW what a movie! i couldn't wait to review this one. just got back from the theater and still impressed by the movie. i knew i was gonna enjoy myself , i was ready for it , and hey , Tom Cruise is in it , that means a lot of fun. and yes what a fun i had watching this one. he is the ultimate hero and you just know he is gonna deliver. so much better than the last batman movie , where you just see the hero get beaten up all the time by some masked dude, and loose all the fights and get sick and break his own bones etc and got trapped blah blah. no , not here, jack reacher is THE man . and he takes care of his situations. in a gentleman way. he asks you friendly if you are sure you wanna get into this.the cast is unbelievable good. the bad guys are really bad and they look like you don't wanna meet them in real life. bravo for the casting. some nice people died in the movie and that felt really sad , i know it is a movie so that was OK than , but you imagine it actually happens sometimes in real life just like they showed you , so realistic. it makes you appreciate your own life better .great plot , great storyline. great funny moments. thanks again tom , you did it again. can't wait for your next movie.",9,4,10,9 February 2013
Taken 2," Liam is such a cool actor, worth the time watching.
","i love it i love it i love it. i am a great fan of the first taken movie , so i was pleased to see the second one , and yes it delivers. i also checked the bad IMDb reviews first , so i knew a bit of the story before i started to see the movie. i have to say something about the bad reviews. these are not fair. for example : 1. somebody complained about the location . and said how beautiful turkey and Istanbul is in real life , and not much was to see about that in the movie.well , it can happen that the bandits hang out in the worst places of town ? not so strange i guess ? bad complain. it just happens that the bad guys didn't go to the beautiful tourist areas with all the nice vacation spots. so what a bad complainso go complain about American movies that do not show the beautiful new york but Bronx projects.2. somebody complained that there were a few women in the movie who wear all black on body and face, Muslims i guess. so what is the complain here? are there no Muslims in a catholic country like turkey ? go to Germany or France or anywhere in Europe , there are millions of these black dressed women with face covered. so i guess you find them in turkey as well. specially around those Muslim churches that are famous there in few parts of town . what a bad complain.3. somebody complained about the girl driving style. she was not such a good driver and now in the action she seems to do an excellent escape job by taxicab. something wrong with that ? nobody ever said she couldn't drive. she just didn't pass the test. she might forget look in mirrors etc. she tried two times to pass the test so actually she really can drive. what a bad complain4. somebody complained about the car driving at the border ? and said that there is no border direct between those two countries. something wrong with that border ? we know there is Greece in between Albania and turkey . but hey maybe they were already in Greece when they passed that border ?what a bad complain. 5. somebody complained Liam was making fun of himself ? that is a personal opinion i guess ? to me he was doing the great job he always does in a movie. 6 . she threw grenades , and no police was seen. that doesn't mean there was no police. of course there was a lot of police , they just didn't show up in the movie , they sure were there doing their job investigating the grenades. come on , there is no need to all film that in the movie. what a bad complain again.7.at the embassy he called his buddy at the golf course , obviously that was a well connected person he knows from his job , somebody that knows people at FBI and CIA , or has personal friends at the embassy , not just some house father. what did you think?8 . plus maybe a few more , the complains are really bad. not so clever as you see. and people complaining about what is real or not ? go see spider man, he climbs on walls, he flies in the air , and has the power of a superhero , how real is that ? so : a bad movie because it is not real ? it is a movie. come on.however , although i liked the movie a lot , i think the movie had a few flaws , but that was OK . it still was great here are a few to mention ; <ul><li>Liam was all the time extremely lucky at the right times. how convenient. - he got chained , but he knows a way to pull his hand out of it. of course at that time all the gangsters left the room in stead of at least one guy should keep an eye on him. - and this one : while he was chained the bad guys stay away exactly long enough so he can make that call at no hurry. very convenient and lucky him again. - also ; everyone has guns all the time but the hiding father in the end scene didn't have a gun . how convenient for the story. - plus another good luck for Liam when he got kidnapped in the van, instead of bringing him 20 miles away or even 50 or more , the gangsters put him very close just 4 miles away from the hotel , so the girl did't had to go travel too far to find him. how convenient. OK , one more, Liam got lucky , the bad guys took their time to slowly start to kill his wife , so slow , that it finally didn't happen. they just teased her with scissors all the while.no hurry.very convenient for Liam to arrive in time. </li></ul>anyway , i loved every second of the movie , BRAVO , great sequel. (but lets be honest the first one was indeed a tiny little better because it was new , and now you just know it , that he will fix the job and all will be OK and save ) hey of course his family is not gonna die. the film producer should do a taken 3 , i will go see it . Liam is such a cool actor, worth the time watching.",9,1,7,8 December 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," i waisted my time .. where is batman ?
","this movie was a big mistake. in so many ways. where was batman ? i almost didn't see him except for a very few times during the long almost 3 hours. and finally when you see him , he got beaten up , thrown away , broke in half , got tired , felt down, lost his voice, loose during fighting, got thrown in some jail , got confused , about crying when he was down. locked up , deceived, etc etc etc. nice nice nice ... NOT.the villain had an irritating voice of a very old and wise university professor , and even when he was standing away 50 feet, it sounded like he was talking right in your ear. is that genius or what ? i say bad job mister sound guy... he looked kind of stupid with that thing on his mouth, but i guess the movie makers had to come up with something original. it also seems this story had nothing to do with the original batman except for his cape , in that case they would have better came up with a new character . and leave batman for the fans. it is like blending seriously spider man or iron man in a scary movie script. a few might appreciate the humor, but it is kind of inappropriate.lets be honest , there were a few good parts interesting to see as well , but didn't save the crap . still waisted my time. i would not have miss anything by not seeing this movie. . and next time make sure batman fans are involved in the production.not just some big shot producer who doesn't care about whatever , just for the bucks. i say it didn't work out , despite the enormous financial success. it was the hype that did it , and batman's good name. i am not specific a batman fan , i just wanted to see a good movie. oh by the way , the end was kind of cheap as well. i started to dislike everything in this movie. 2 stars because i didn't turn it off halfway...(hoping for better).",2,8,15,9 February 2013
