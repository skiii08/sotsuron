The Avengers," All around great
","Most fun I've had in a long, long time. Yes, FUN. Although this movie was just about 2 1/2 hours long, it was so entertaining and engrossing for me that it seemed like about 1 1/2 hours. The character development was good and each character was given a bit of screen time to develop the character. The action was good and not overpowering, it only added to rather than being the main part of the movie. The comic level was perfect. Not too much goofy stuff said just to try and get laughs. Every line, imo, was perfectly placed (although I'll have to see it again in order to hear some funny lines that I missed due to the laughter in the theater!). By the way, morning matin√©e was SOLD OUT full. Each character was 'in character' as we know them...Captain America was still the 40's guy; Iron Man was still, well, Iron Man, Thor...perfect, the Hulk - super good, best depiction I've seen, etc. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie because it fulfilled all my 'likes' for a movie...good vs. evil and good kicking butt; enjoyable fun time and escape, good dialog, good looking and PG. I've seen enough violence and sex and love the break for some simple ol' good times.",10,6,11,6 May 2012
First Man," I did NOT want to see this movie
","I know the story and have seen the movies/documentaries about this particular flight. But there was nothing else at this time so I figured I'd just bear it out. Well I could not be more wrong about a movie. This movie was great and very entertaining. It was a different take on the 1st man on the moon story. They developed the characters better, the flight training scenes and simulation and take off were captivating and exciting. So was the music. Ryan Gosling was perfect for this part. It gave me a new appreciation for our abilities as a nation because if you think about it, this was quite a feat indeed. Don't miss this one on the big screen...I saw it in IMAX...the bigger the better for this one.",10,10,22,17 October 2018
Skyfall," All the elements and feeling, too!
","I loved this movie. Daniel Craig is my fav Bond, even over Sean. Why? Because his portrayal of Bond is more real, better acted with action and great camera work/photography.Anyway, this Bond movie was the best so far because it took us into the lives of these characters more than ever before, IMO. There is action enough for the action hounds (like me) and good scenery, not an overindulgence of gratuitous sex scenes but enough to keep the storyline going and Bond's reputation in tact.I saw a different Bond in this movie - to me, I saw the humanness of this super agent. I liked the new characters and the actors who portrayed them. Loved Ralph Fiennes, Javier Bardem and OF COURSE, Judi Dench. Gosh, she's good. What a great ride this movie was because it had all the elements of an entertaining, action-filled, emotion-filled movie that delved more into the characters that I've come to love. Then it added some new faces that I cannot wait to see again!Daniel Craig's bright blue eyes (great body) and brooding demeanor are perfect for a man who has seen so much destruction as James Bond. That's why he's the best Bond yet. Big shoes to fill when he retires! But let's not think about that yet...I say without reservation...see this movie. Our 10:00 a.m. packed-house movie crowd clapped at the end.",10,18,39,10 November 2012
A Star Is Born," A perfect movie...
","Bradley Cooper can sing! Over the years he's proven his acting ability very well but hearing him sing makes me believe he can also have a music career. We all know LG can sing but surprisingly she can definitely act with only a couple of times when she seemed forced. The chemistry between these two was solid, although Cooper tends to have good chemistry with his co-stars, imo. This movie has the things that make for an entertaining movie...good acting, good music and good drama. And I appreciated that it wasn't so music-centered that the drama was lacking. The character development was good and the storyline kept my interest throughout the movie. Good directing by Cooper caused it to flow well with only a couple of times where it seemed to skip a beat. You won't be sorry you saw this movie on the big screen.",9,1,2,17 October 2018
Argo," Ben Affleck hits it in Argo...
","Not only did I like Ben Affleck's longer hair but his acting has come a long way, IMO. This was a truly edge-of-your-seat movie and the fact that it really happened was amazing. I kept thinking when those leaders in the Middle East where it took place see this movie they will be kicking themselves.For me, this was one of those movies that kept up a good pace that didn't rely on car chases and shoot 'em ups (both of which I enjoy!). It was smartly written and acted. The gray tones of the movie kept it in character with the subject matter.Not knowing the true story before now and seeing how incredible it was, just made it all the sweeter. An enjoyable encounter with real spys and capers. Oh and John Goodman, as usual, fit the bill as did Allan Arkin. Just liked this movie and liked that 'we' did it...",9,1,3,28 October 2012
Little Boy," A Nice Change of Pace on an Important Issue
","Rich, colorful scenery and characters, great story. I was surprised at how good the acting was in this movie, too. The young actor who portrays the 'little boy' is spot on in his emotions and acting ability. Wow, a star in the making I believe.When you can forget your surroundings and just get immersed in a movie for a couple of hours, it is a great thing.We never outgrow our need to be reminded of some of the most basic and important things of life but I definitely say parents ought to bring their age-appropriate kids to this one. This film moves along nicely and keeps pace with your interest level! Since my own mother lived during the years the movie takes place, I can attest to the fact that it is pretty true-to-life. As I watched it some of her stories of life during that time came back to me.Our movie-going audience clapped at the end of the movie. There was no way I could not clap, too. I really liked this one.",10,19,37,25 April 2015
Aquaman," Now THIS is Aquaman!
","At the risk of sounding 'gushy' I really, really enjoyed Aquaman. Sure Jason Mamoa was a big reason for that, but this was a pure fantasy excitement ride. A few times I had to remind myself to 'relax' while watching the almost non-stop action. IMO, forget all previous incarnations of Aquaman, Momoa nails the part. Gritty but not too much, cool but not fake cool...he's just cool period, perfect physically for the role. I mean wouldn't Aquaman be 6' 4' and very handsome? The action and CGI of this movie are beautiful, you really get to delve into fantasy-land for 2 hours. Every character was portrayed well by each actor. There is no portrayal that I didn't like. And it has a good story line that kept me interested. Frankly, it was so entertaining I've already seen it twice and plan to see it in IMAX at least once more. Definitely a BIG screen movie as there are scenes where there is a lot going on visually.",10,3,4,2 January 2019
BlacKkKlansman," Good balance
","I'm not a Spike Lee fan, necessarily. This movie has given me a reason to become one. What I liked most about this movie, other than the imaginative title, is that Spike Lee shows that there is also camaraderie between black and white, something that is very true in real life, but unfortunately that doesn't make the news headlines. And this is back in the 70's! I was pleasantly surprised to see a movie that showed that. Granted it must have been a part of Ron Stallworth's experience, but nonetheless, I appreciate that Spike Lee appropriately focused on it. The movie itself was entertaining, funny and moving. John David Washington did a great job portraying Stallworth. And I loved Adam Driver's character. He's turning out to be one of my fav actors.With all the hassles of 'racism' in today's America, I loved that this movie showed one man's story of courage, imagination and success assisted, helped and applauded by his workmates...regardless of his or their color. Bravo to Spike Lee. This is also a part of real life.",8,10,21,15 September 2018
Fast & Furious 6," Got caught up to see what the hype was about...
","Thoroughly enjoyed this film. Totally unbelievable at times, but it's a movie for entertainment purposes. Not a documentary.I had never seen a F&F movie, so I got the DVDs (except for the Tokyo one; heard it was not so hot). I enjoyed 1, 2, 4 and 5 so I was expecting to enjoy 6. Did I ever. I love the fast cars, the sorta over-the-top machismo of the guys and the idea of family. Taking the movies from the racing scene to heists, etc. is an interesting maturing of the franchise. How many race motives can you come up with to stay interesting and relevant? Getting into the heist-action is a good turn, I think. The guys/girls are growing up and it's nice to see some change while keeping in the great fast car scenes. Dwayne Johnson is too much (in a good way) and he seems like more of a caricature of a man. He's just so dang big and 'hulking' over anyone else. But that just adds to the fun of the movie.The photography is so good - to my eye it's flawless (and I'm always on the lookout for those details about the scene that are missed between 'cut' and 'action'). The character development is maturing, too, as we get to know these guys through the years. The funny lines are good and some are so small & quick, you might miss 'em.Looking forward to 7 - I love it when you get involved in a movie franchise where you look forward to seeing your 'friends' again. This is one of those for me.",8,0,1,10 June 2013
Trouble with the Curve," Trouble with WHAT curve??
","I didn't know what 'the curve' related to until I saw the movie. Good, good flick for anyone looking for a good Clint fix. Frankly I was more happy with this movie than I thought I would be. Other than Clint Eastwood, I am not a big fan of the other actors, except John Goodman. But I have to say Amy Adams and Justin Timberlake did a good job. I enjoyed watching them and changing my mind! A sweet story about life, about a dad and his daughter and about a game that takes so many people away from loved ones. This is the kind of Clint Eastwood movie that we'll miss someday when he's not making movies anymore. IMO, he always makes movies that are likable and 'nice' to watch. Whether spaghetti westerns, cops/robbers, or everyday life movies, Clint Eastwood has a signature style in movies and movie making. Definitely worth seeing on the big screen for an enjoyable couple of hours or so.",8,5,12,28 September 2012
Now You See Me," Smooth,cool and fun
","Loved this movie. Gotta say the 'cool' factor got to me in every crucial aspect of this flick. It is difficult to be 'cool' without being corny or coming off silly. Even Woody H. is getting to be enjoyable to me and he's never been one of my fav actors. The storyline is simple and it moves fast with no time to get bored. Each character is acted out really slick, not superficially deep (although I would have enjoyed more character development) and kept my attention.The two heavies, M. Freeman & M. Caine, were very good, of course, and give the movie two solid performances that complement very well the other cast members. Mark Ruffalo was spot on - gosh he's good, why hasn't he made more movies I wonder? (Love him as the Hulk).Jesse Eisenberg is so dang believable that he better do something else quick or he's going to be forever etched in my mind as an illusionist! His character's glances and demeanor are great with, to me, an underlying sense of he can't believe how good he & the other 3 are at what they do. I loved that about each character - they weren't arrogant to the point of unbelievability or boredom. It's like they all were on a ride they could hardly believe. LOL, I kept looking at Isla Fisher and thinking, 'Is that Amy Adams?' But I knew it couldn't be. And Dave Franco - the look-alike baby Franco brother did a good job with his smaller part.I know I've said it already, but this movie is cool. It had me believing that the tricks could be done. One of the best movies for what it is - entertainment, plain and simple. My friend and I left saying, 'good movie, I liked that.' Definitely a big screen movie.Oh, and guess what? They guessed the card I & my friend picked! How'd they do that??",8,31,61,4 June 2013
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," While I miss Frodo...I am enjoying Bilbo!
","The adventure continues and just like the Lord of the Rings, Two Towers, this 'middle' movie kinda leaves you unsatisfied. Mostly because you know what is just around the corner! Maybe two movies could have been better, as in LOTR, but if you love these movies you put up with the 'middles' and feeling unsatisfied a bit! Martin Freeman (Bilbo) continues to carry this character just fine. I had my doubts at first but when I saw The Hobbit, I was sold. He IS Bilbo Baggins now just as Elijah Wood IS Frodo. The other actors play their parts exceedingly well, too. Will anyone ever be able to re-make these movies with others? I think NO unless they wait a generation or so.As a reader of the books, I see that many small, rather important details are left out mostly due to necessity of time restraints. And to me this does not take away from the enjoyment of the story. Although, IMO, there are more missing details from the Hobbit tales than from LOTR. Again, this does not take away from my enjoyment of the flicks.I love that Orlando Bloom (Legolas) is still doing great skateboarding-type moves, too. I cracked up at that. The addition of Evangeline Lilly is perfect as she is as much an Elf-like beauty as Liv Tyler. All the actors including the usual suspects (Ian, Richard, Andy, etc.) do a stellar job in portraying their fantasy characters. An enjoyable ride through Middle Earth...",8,0,3,29 December 2013
Wreck-It Ralph," I'm not a gamer...
","OK, so I'm not a gamer by any means & my review is going to be non-techy. Hey, I liked PacMan back in the day and now that seems archaic.I went to see this Wreck-it Ralph because it looked like fun. And it was. This movie has beautiful visual colors/scenes and funny antics & lines galore. The storyline is very clever and engaging. And I loved the sessions with the other game icons, very cute. The actor voices were right on, especially Silverman. Wow, how can her voice sound like that?What I wonder is will kids like this movie? To me it seemed rather adult in the story and I'm not sure a kid under 10 would necessarily get it. But an older kid or adult who likes animation and creativity will love it. It is amazing what they do with animation today and this really is a feast for the eyes. With a fast pace and good dialog, this movie kept my attention and had me laughing at times and leaving with a smile on my face. That's a good sign to me.",8,2,2,7 December 2012
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," 'An unexpected journey' indeed!
","As a big fan of the Tolkien Hobbit and Lord of the Rings books, then the LotR movies, frankly I did not hold much hope that The Hobbit would be as good as its predecessor movies. From the movie trailers I had seen, I was not impressed with the actor who plays Bilbo. But I went to see it anyway.Wow! Peter Jackson does it again. I was transported to that realm that I remember from 10 years ago when I first saw Fellowship of the Ring. I had never seen such a good movie-from-book and was an immediate fan. I've seen them multiple times. The Hobbit is every bit as good and entertaining as the LotR movies. And Martin Freeman IS Bilbo Baggins; I was so wrong in being unimpressed with him in the trailers. And Thorin Oakenshield played by Richard Armitage is spot on. With many of the beloved characters being portrayed by the original actors, it was somewhat of a coming home after a long time. And for me, this point helps with any creative license that Jackson took in straying from the original story. (I don't go to movies based on books to 'see a book' - I go to see the interpretation of the book. Bottom line, books don't generally make for good movies if taken word-for-word).The photography/scenery was not as good as the LotR, IMO, for this first installment of The Hobbit but the music, the writing and the acting was so good I still gave it a 10. I'll take the latter over good photography/scenery any day. Jackson has managed to once again, take a fantasy and make it so desirable that one can hardly wait until 2013 and 2014 for the 2nd and final installments. Interestingly, BTW, for me my 3 hours sitting in the theater went by so fast I checked my watch at the end of the movie. A good sign, as I always say.",10,5,15,14 December 2012
Avengers: Infinity War," Just not enough!
","OK, as I watched this movie with great expectations at first I felt like there were jut too many characters and not enough storyline development. All these Avengers and friends were bunched into 2.5 hours and there just didn't seem to be enough time for each of them. But remembering this is part 1 of 2 parts, settles me down. And it is, more or less, a culmination of sorts of many years of Avenger movies. So part 2 will be a must see and I can hardly wait. The worst thing about Infinity War is that it cuts off way to early and leaves the viewer wanting MORE.The best things about this movie are the villian Thanos...you love, hate and feel pity for him. But you also understand what he's saying. And thank God that Thor gets his eye back. I was not looking forward to a one-eyed Thor. AND he gets a new 'hammer' in the form of a super ax. There are parts in this movie that are so cool you just want to clap out loud. The one-liners are there, too, and they are funny but you have to be fast to catch 'em. Especially when the audience is laughing out loud.I missed seeing Jeremy Renner's character (Hawkeye) wonder why they left him out? This is definitely what I call a 'bridge' movie, because it connects another movie(s) to a movie that isn't released yet. Frankly, at the end of the movie when the screen goes black, I was thinking, 'What? They're going to leave me now?!' I was kind of disappointed. BUT upon further reflection, it needed to be done this way or else make a 6.5 hour movie. (I felt the same thing with the Lord of the Rings, 'The Two Towers' movie...another bridge movie). But settling down I have to say this is a great movie even if it leaves you wanting for much more. Hopefully part 2 will be released soon...in 2019? I can dream.",10,2,11,29 April 2018
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Well thank goodness for Great Movie Experiences!
","I was very pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed Walter Mitty. Ben Stiller hit it out of the ballpark with this one. His acting style and expressions were perfect for the odd Mitty character. The comedic timing was very good and caught me off-guard most of the time...you know when you don't expect to laugh and then something so cute or funny causes you to crack up. Out loud. I was not too familiar with Kristen Wiig but her portrayal of Cheryl was spot on. She is interesting to look at and her demeanor really fit with Walter's. I enjoyed watching them interact. Shirley McLaine playing the mom was good, too. Actually I like Ms. McClaine's performances much better as a older woman than I did in her early movies. The CG stuff was not overdone and I did not see too many 'oops' moments in this movie. You know the scenes where you can tell it was CG'd. I cannot end without giving kudos to Sean Penn. Another perfect casting choice as he played his character to a tee and was very believable. His ruddy, rough looks fit well with his character's profession.",10,10,21,27 December 2013
A Quiet Place," Smart thriller using virtually no gore...
","I really, really liked this movie. I didn't expect too much since it seemed the trailer showed most of the movie's premise! But I was pleasantly surprised as there is more to this movie than the trailer. WOW! I had to take my pulse about 1/2 way through just to see if my heart was acting the same as my psyche. The acting involved for every actor was perfect and each character was cast very well, imo. The appropriate 'darkness' of the filming added to the suspense as well as the music (which was appropriately 'back ground' enough to be relevant but not intrusive). And what an interesting premise! You come into the movie after some horrible stuff has taken place on earth, nice touch. And then you go from there into the smart storyline and directing. I have a renewed appreciation of Krasinski. The audience I was part of applauded after the movie 'abruptly' ended. I like that kind of thriller roller-coaster, edge of your seat ride. Fun. See it.",10,26,51,6 April 2018
Grudge Match," You're still the same...GREAT!
","Refreshingly the same...two great actors doing what they do best and NOT apologizing for it. I LOVED this movie. It's got a good, fun storyline that is good for adults AND kids. It's got emotion and funny lines and moves along nicely. Note, it's not fantasy, beat 'em up sci-fi, good vs. evil, action heros, etc. (all of which I love, too). It is a nice movie about two guys who missed something years before due to basically a misunderstanding, a common type of misunderstanding that humans make.Best of all I was able to see Stallone do a bit of acting, which, to me, is kinda rare. Yes, he is mostly his Rocky persona but with more substance. And Dinero...well, what can you say? This man has moved from strong drama to comedy to casual-type characters with ease. He can be menacing in one movie and really funny in another. I love these guys and their own acting abilities. And oh boy, seeing that beauty, Kim Basinger...she's good, too. I think early on her strong beauty may have kept her out of some roles. But now she can hang with the best of them, IMO. And she is still a beauty. Kevin Hart provides cute comic relief, too. He can be a bit over-the-top, but it works fine here.Most surprising to me is Jon Bernthal. I remember this guy from the Walking Dead and I was glad when his character was killed off in that series! He's so good, I hated him! But what I see here is that he has a good bit of acting ability. He's believable (which is the main reason I hated him in Walking Dead!).All-in-all, this is a good movie. Don't listen to the so-called pro critics. Gosh, I dislike how they pan some really good movies (like Depp's Lone Ranger, which was SO funny). What's up with them? I really miss Siskel and Ebert...they were most balanced, IMO.",10,13,23,29 December 2013
Magic Mike XXL," Sequels have been good until now
","UGH...just saw MM XXL and I left the theater feeling grubby. Look, I'm no prude and I really liked the first Magic Mike and was hoping to see the same kind of guilty pleasure with some good moves. Forget it. These guys just used their nice bodies in a showy, uninteresting way and there was very little classy hot dancing.It's such a rip off when actors just walk through a movie because it's going to make money. Wait for the DVD if you want to see this. It's corny, sleazy, very little dancing by the guys and a stupid, stupid story line. This movie had no class at all as the first Magic Mike had...that one was good! Sheesh, I almost walked out about 25 min. into the movie, but then I thought I could not give a solid review if I did. What a waste of my time. I should have gone to Terminator.",1,130,211,1 July 2015
Lincoln," Artistically & Politically Grand
","Daniel Day Lewis is the Academy Award winner for best actor in 2012, hands down, with this addition to his resume of great acting parts. He truly IS Abraham Lincoln as well as we can know the man over 100 years later. How does a Brit (of Irish & English decent) do that American accent and mannerisms so well? Don't know. But it's so worth the time and money to see this movie just because of DDL's performance.Now, regarding the movie...I loved it. It totally captured my imagination and transported me back to the Civil War era. Jumping right in at the time of Lincoln's Presidency, we are brought into this small but very important time in his legacy and our country's history. The accompanying actors are splendid with none, IMO, lacking although not holding a candle to DDL's performance. The cinematography and sets are splendid, and costuming was interesting and spot on for this film. The storyline moves nicely for a non-action flick and before I knew it, the movie was over! Good sign, I'd say.Interestingly, to take such a relatively small part of history and make it into a 2+ hr. movie that was entertaining and captivating was no small feat. Especially when one considers the genre...no car chases, no action, no sex, no 'language' to speak of and no special noticeable effects. Grand mention needs to be made of Steven Spielberg's direction of this film. Had Spielberg written all over it as he's one director that seems to be able to bring out the kind of emotion and feeling that is rarely felt while watching a movie. Can anyone say, Best Director?Because some parts of American history is so lacking in education, to see the 'beginnings' of the Republican party was eye-opening and I applaud Producers and Director for their passion (which is obvious) and their historical covering of such a great time in American history. Truly I am proud to be an American after watching this film. Teary-eye I clapped at the end along with others who probably felt similar kinds of emotions. Don't miss it on the Big screen. Lincoln was a Big screen kinda man.",10,5,13,21 November 2012
Edge of Tomorrow," Ah, yes...a good Tom Cruise movie like I knew he could do!
","I don't need to be concerned that I'll have any spoilers in this review. I like this movie so much and I would not even think to put a spoiler in my review but encourage everyone to see this on the big screen.This is the kind of movie that I love to watch and for me, it's been too long since I've seen a good Tom Cruise movie. This is the kind of drama and has the kind of subtle comedy that I love to see in a movie. The action was good and paced nicely with the irony of the storyline. You see Tom Cruise's character change and grow as the movie progresses and that's good.The supporting cast is spot on. I didn't see actors, I saw characters. Good fun. Enough said for me.",10,6,10,8 June 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," Just the WOLF...
","'Best movie of the year'? Really? If this is the best we can get from a so-called great director, then we're really missing the mark. The story was totally lost in the debauchery, extreme full nudity, foul language rather than good scripting, etc., etc. I don't care about what a director thinks is 'art' but for crying out loud, don't give it an 'R' rating when it's got so much porn in it. Who paid off whom to get this an 'R' rating? I'm angry with those who call this art. Art is taking a probably interesting story and not resorting to an overuse of trashy scenes and language to tell that story in an 'R' rated movie. OK, sure, this man's life was excessive and degrading to the human spirit, but the actual story was lost in the crap I saw on screen over and over. I did not read the book so I'm not sure how close the movie stayed to it. But it seems to me that M.S. just wanted to push the envelope without telling anyone how much he pushed it until you bought you ticket and were in your seat expecting to see a good flick with a good actor. Disappointing to me and other than what I've already written, there is nothing about this movie that makes it noteworthy to me. Leonardo needs a great script again to stand up to his acting prowess. He's great...too great for trashy movies. I'm losing it for Martin Scorsese quickly.",2,29,56,27 December 2013
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," BVS -- Was I ever wrong on this one...
","I gasped when I heard Ben Affleck was going to play Batman. I could not see him being a super hero nor could I see him standing up to Henry Cavill as Superman. At the time I decided I'd wait for the DVD. BUT I could not resist seeing Henry Cavill be Superman again, so I bit the bullet and went today.WOW! A great super hero movie! I am a big fan of Avengers and the like and BVS surpassed by expectations big time. Ben Affleck was a perfect Batman, maybe the best so far. Henry Cavill is a perfect Superman in looks and how he plays the man of steel's personality. Henry's acting is getting tighter, too. Spot on. I'm definitely going to see it again in the theater.The whole look of the movie is basically dark but not as dark and grungy as Dead Pool (ugh). The action starts at the beginning and pretty much continues throughout the movie. Diane Lane as Clark Kent's mom is perfect. Actually all the actors did a splendid job as I didn't see them, but their characters.For me, there were no corny parts, as some of these movies can have, just great camera work and special effects giving the 2.5 hour movie the feeling of 1.5, IMO.The downside for me is that I will probably have to wait 2 years to see the sequel (which definitely has to be on the table by now, this one was so good). So I admit, I was wrong about Ben Affleck being totally wrong for the Batman character. He did a solid job and went toe-to-toe with Henry Cavill. Loved it...a fun ride. (Henry Cavill is the most perfect looking man I've ever seen BUT that didn't color my review...much!)",10,0,2,25 March 2016
The Greatest Showman," WHAT A SURPRISE!
","I start off by saying I'm not much into the newer musicals, I like a good drama but don't like characters breaking out into song at crucial moments! That's just too corny for my tastes.So on 12/30/17 in the early evening I had a couple of hours to kill...I decided to see Hugh Jackman in The Greatest Showman. I sat down prepared to see a great drama about PT Barnum when all of a sudden a song breaks out. I was bummed at first but then like the song and it 'fit' into the scene. I was disappointed that it was a musical but oh well. OH WELL NOTHING! This is one of the most entertaining, happy, great acting movies I've seen in a long, long time. (And I see a lot of movies). Hugh Jackman is a great song/dance man. He's right up there with the likes of one of my favs, Gene Kelly, imo. His timing, his acting is spot on. To the point of I may like him better in musicals than dramas...not sure yet.And what can I say about Zac Efron? This man was made for song/dance. That is where he shines. The stupid comedies he's made should be the very, very last resort, if at all. They are a waste of his time and talent. I was entertained by his acting and singing all through the movie. I found a new love for Zac.The MUSIC is FABULOUS. I love every song...the melodies and lyrics were really good and totally fit the scenes they were in. I can't say that about any other musical that comes to mind. The choreographing was spot on, too. Every kind of body type got a good chance to shine, it wasn't just the tall or slim or pretty. Good job on that point.I loved this movie...the colors, the costumes, the songs, the dance sequences all were perfect and exciting. I left the theater feeling happy and excited about musicals again.",10,5,11,2 January 2018
The Hangover Part III," 'It coulda been a contender...''
","Well, in order to enjoy this 3 installment I thought I should get the first two DVDs. I did and enjoyed them for the most part. Gotta say, Bradley Cooper only gets better looking so the eye candy factor was worth sitting through some of these movies.I was looking forward to #3. I found it to be the smartest one with regard to the comedy aspect. Some of the physical comedy, glances and lines were really good. I liked the storyline, too. Totally unbelievable but entertaining. As the movie was coming to an end I was feeling happy and satisfied...and then came the ending. Really? Did he have to do that? Did he have to show that? And frankly, that was not even funny...not the line, not the delivery, not the uh, er...well, nothing was funny about the ending.For me that took this movie and put it right in the corn-ball trash category. They did not have to go for the shock value and I don't know why someone who could didn't stop it. From classy comedy to trashy, that's how it was for me. Puleeze.",5,0,0,31 May 2013
Minions," Stuck on the Minions
","Very funny and cute movie. Some of the comedy is probably over the heads of the little kids but the visuals can keep them entertained.The storyline is obviously a prequel and was interestingly written and flowed well into current minion lore. Since I did not get into the minions through the Despicable Me movies, I'm a late bloomer but definitely a fan now.This was the first time I could actually hear real words that the minions spoke...too funny. They are lovable, adorable and funny. The new movie franchise I think as long as the writers can keep the stories interesting, clever and funny.",10,8,15,27 July 2015
The Great Gatsby," Music tried to be the star...
","This is a spectacular story...(done well by Robert Redford's portrayal of Gatsby all those years ago when he was gorgeous!). Leonardo DiCaprio stood out and was impressive (gosh he's good!) and that's the only reason this movie was worth my time. OK, yes, it was pretty to look at when you were in the party scenes but I have to say, the music was way too distracting for me. How can you take such a loved novel and put in today's type of music and think it's cool? There were times where the music was better because it was 'period' music. But frankly, when you get into rap or hip hop in a movie that takes place in the 20's, that's corny to me. It took me away from the storyline into thinking it was a concession to the music moguls who were part of this production. I also laughed at some of the dancing girl scenes, wondering if some of those dance moves were done in that time! (Maybe they were and Beyonce, et al, are just copycats!). All in all, it came off as corny to me and I'd tell folks to wait for the video and read the book or see Redford's version. Gosh, I hope this director doesn't take on Gone With The Wind!",7,3,6,12 May 2013
