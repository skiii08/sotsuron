Skyfall," Dreadful
","So there is not much action and a silly plot. No girls and Bond does not behave like Bond. Along with a lot of other people in the audience last night I was grumbling and unhappy. Cannot say where these positive reviews are coming from but I do not know anyone who has seen this film and liked it.The plot does not really exist, but if it did then it would be really, really silly. I actually watched a confrontation between Craig and Silva and thought it reminded me of Armstrong and Miller doing the ranking airmen. Bond follows leads halfway through the film only for them to become irrelevant. As for the lack of girls. This is Bond. Where are they.",2,17,42,12 November 2012
Cloverfield," No plot, no action, camcorder all the way through.
","Hand-held camcorder ALL the way through. Not very interesting. little action. No plot. Unsympathetic characters (if that's what they were).The first half hour or so is setting up the characters at a party. Unfortunately this sets the characters up as unsympathetic, and the film never recovers. That's when I realised I was in for camcorder footage all the way through. It was exactly what you might expect, so if you really want to see this film choose a big cinema where you can sit at the back and not be too nauseated by the random movements.The rest of the film is not very entertaining and consists of the camcorder being carried around New York as the action takes place off screen.I really don't recommend this film.",1,18,27,24 February 2008
Avengers: Endgame," Entertaining Chaos
","I'll keep it short. The acting is pretty good, where the characters are allowed to be in shot for more than a few seconds. No-one is allowed to dominate and it feels the directors emphasised the strengths of the protagonists. The strong one, the honest one, the kind one, the damaged on.As others pointed out the plot was preposterous but made up for by great subplots.The effects were huge and fortunately not quite as confusing as Transformers.",7,0,2,27 January 2020
Aladdin," Pretty Good
","OK, so Will Smith is playing himself. But it's controlled so he is entertaining and witty without being intrusive. The effects are such that they do not obscure the movie. The city scenes are especially Caravaggio and magical.We all know the plot and characters from the panto. So no surprises. But again, it's mot over the top. Jafar is acted especially well.This movie got some bad reviews. In my view the audience got what was promised. A high production value,decently played simple fantasy.",8,2,3,27 January 2020
