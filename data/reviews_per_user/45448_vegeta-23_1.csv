The Avengers," What a movie
",This was the movie!!!! I have been an avenger ever since I was 16 and was reading my first comic although I was a marvel fan WELL before that.... so I have been waiting for this movie for a good 11 years!!!Avengers Assemble is near enough the perfect movie and Marvel have finally done the unthinkable and ousted The Dark Knight as greatest comic book movie (and actually greatest movie of all time!) Joss Whedon as Director put tingles down my spine as I am a major Buffy and Angel fan in addition to him writing the greatest X Men Story of all time (Astonishing X Men) I knew we was in excellent hands!If there are 2 minor criticms of this movie it would be these: 1: Maria Hill by Cobie Smulders... Im a major fan of HIMYM and her character Robin Schebatsky and miss smulders is a major crush of mine however they made Maria Hill into your carbon copy standard issue agent! If this was going to be the way no need for her to be so heavily featured in the advertising...2: The Battle Cry isn't actually screamed out in the movieDespite these 2 oversights it simply is the greatest movie of all time!10/10,10,9,19,27 April 2012
