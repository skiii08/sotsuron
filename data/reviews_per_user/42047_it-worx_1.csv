The Longest Yard," some neat jokes but not enough
","The longest yard is the near 1:1 copy of the UK-Movie 'Mean Machine', save it is about American Football, while the original is about Soccer. Even the convicts team name 'Mean Machine' is the same in the original, and so are the participating characters. The only introduction of something new in it is 'Babyface' co-commenting the game, who I think has his best line with: 'Thanks, Bob'. As I'm not a big fan of US remakes of European films (they're usually not half as good as the originals), and I don't see any creative additions made to the script, I have given this movie a 3 out of 10. If you don't know the original and / or don't dig soccer, plus like the good old Hollywood version of David & Goliath in which the underdog triumphs over his mighty opponents, you might enjoy watching it.",3,7,14,24 September 2005
