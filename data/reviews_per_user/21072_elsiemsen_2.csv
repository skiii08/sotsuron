Requiem for a Dream," Couldn't pull my eyes off the screen
",Graphic and disgusting in all the right ways and incredibly captivating. I wasn't sure it was 'my type of movie' but if you've been touched by drug addiction in any way (most people have been) then this movie is a must watch.,10,0,0,3 August 2018
About Time," Fantasy movies aren't for me
",At least that's what I thought before watching this one. This movie does an excellent job showing what's going on inside Tim's mind as events unfold without getting cheesy in the narration bits. A movie I will always come back to and never find myself getting tired of.,9,2,2,3 August 2018
