Iron Man 3," IRON MAN 3 could have been better :(
",Iron Man 3 was a great movie because they had interesting things like how iron man put the mark 42 suit on mandarin and blew it up when the mandarin was in it and how tony made all the iron man suits come and fight mandarins forces:) also how much tony went threw the mandarin but what i would do is give mandarin all his power from his rings because he only used firepower that is only one out of ten of his mandarin powers and i would put less gun fights and more iron man fights and i would make the final battle tony vs mandarin not pepper potts vs mandarin if i were to remake this movie i would make the mark 42 charge in a few minutes and tony would have to fight the mandarin with ten rings and tony would kill mandarin with a super mega blast shlok m,8,1,3,25 July 2013
