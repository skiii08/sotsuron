The Sound of Music," Truly Classic!
","I first watched this movie when I was about 5 or 6 years old and didn't think anything of it but now that I am 14 years old and am old enough to appreciate and understand the storyline I am in love with everything about it: the breathtaking scenery of Austria, the exciting storyline and most of all, the classic songs by Rodgers and Hammerstein.Has Julie Andrews ever been captured more beautifully? As a huge fan of hers I love the way she captivates the audience with her natural beauty and sparkle. She absolutely lights up the screen as Maria von Trapp and is fantastic in her role. She truly deserved the best actress Oscar for her performance. Her voice is incredible, one of the best I have ever heard and the last note of the 'do re mi' sequence proves that. Her acting is just as good as her singing and I believe that this picture shows that she is not only a brilliant stage actress but is also a legend on the screen.Christopher Plummer gives a slight darkness to the film as the stern Captain von Trapp which is great because it gives variety to the characters in the film and shows that not all of them are sweet and sugary.Eleanor Parker (Baroness Shoerader), Richard Haydn (Max), Peggy Wood (Mother Abbess) and all 7 children form a great supporting cast and add to the success of the movie.The Sound of Music is truly a classic movie and will be around for many more years to come. If you haven't seen this movie then I strongly recommend you do because I guarantee you that you will love it. It is unique in that it does not rely on drugs, violence, sex or bad language for its success and is just simply a brilliant masterpiece suitable for all ages.Exquisite!! 10/10 stars",10,3,10,6 January 2007
Pride & Prejudice," The chemistry is amazing!
",The chemistry between Elizabeth Bennet (Kiera Knightley) and Mr. Darcy (Matthew MacFadyen) is so amazing. It is truly beautiful to see right from the beginning the attraction between the two lovers. I so badly wanted them to be together and was so glad at the end. It seems like such a fairytale watching it and the storyline is superb. I don't think I could ever get bored of this wonderful movie. I highly recommend this movie to all who have not seen it as it is the second most beautiful movie I have ever seen (after The Sound of Music of course). I hope it remains around forever. It deserves to!Excellent movie! 10/10 stars,10,3,8,6 January 2007
