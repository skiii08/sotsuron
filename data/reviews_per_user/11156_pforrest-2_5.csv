The New World," Beautiful to look at, but self-indulgent, appalling script and direction
","I wish I hadn't watched this film. Gorgeous cinematography but grossly flawed direction, dialogue and feel, with tedious sudden cuts to black, random bits of natural footage inserted, and a tendency to avoid having the speaker in shot. There's one classic moment where a woman is walking along the other side of the palisade from Pocahontas, who is walking at the same pace, listening. Exactly as the woman reached the end of the palisade her speech ended too. It reminded me of those scenes in nudist films where convenient props hide private parts. Here, the idea was to avoid the indecency of seeing actors actually speaking lines... It was almost as if they had had problems with lip-sync. Another thing that really got to me was the way that every boat or ship voyage, even across the Atlantic, was illustrated with... river footage. There were some classy actors in this film, but the direction didn't give them any help at all, apart from making them look superb. In fact I suspect casting was done largely on looks.",1,1,6,16 July 2007
Walk the Line," Excellent; stunning lead performances, an emotional and musical triumph.
","A bit late, but I finally got to see Walk The Line. Just a biopic of a flawed character who had the great idea to play a prison as his comeback gig? No. Beautifully directed, well-performed throughout, with a totally believable script, and two of the most stunning lead performances you could ever wish for.It's sad to check the awards this film received, and see time after time that Reece W won best female actor while Joaquin P was only nominated for best male actor. She undoubtedly deserved her awards - it's one of the finest performances I have ever seen in a movie for years - but he is pretty much up there with her in every way. I just hope he didn't go to many of the ceremonies, because his superb portrayal deserved equal success, not also-ran status. Gritting one's teeth and smiling for the eighteenth time could turn a man to drink and drugs.Great singing and playing, great acting, well shot, well scripted .... I loved this movie!",9,1,2,7 December 2006
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Worth seeing even for a non-megafan of Star Wars
","This is a pretty well-told adventure story, full of some great action. It avoids whimsy, and for the second time in a row features a strong (but still rather delightful) female lead. Last time it was the estimable Daisy Ridley; this time the even more estimable Felicity Jones. How on earth as an actor do you move from Stephen Hawking's long-suffering wife in academia to being an action hero (with the small matter of dying of cancer in A Monster Calls somewhere in the process)? She did it. She is clearly made of tougher stuff than her sweet diffident English appearance seems to show. Altogether this film demonstrates one of the reasons why movies need making - drama, excitement, action, and at the heart of it, a real person that can be identified with and/or admired.",8,1,3,16 January 2017
Shutter Island," Appalling nonsense.
","I had the misfortune of seeing this movie the night after seeing Johnny Kervorkian's 'The Disappeared'. That movie is a bit slow-moving, but has strong performances and at the end of it I felt I had passed a really worthwhile evening watching it. Shutter Island, in contrast, was a pile of excrement. Great locations, an A-list cast, big budget everything.... but a contrived and totally worthless story. Absolutely insulting to the people who died in concentration camps. At some stage in the second half Sir Ben Kingsley utters a long fatuous line about the whole story being an ultra-elaborate attempt to get the lead character to connect back with reality, and I flipped, and stormed out. Maybe I'm crazy, but this was crap.",2,3,7,4 March 2011
La La Land," Nice performances from the leads, and generally good fun.
","I had a bit of a dilemma at the cinema last week ... go and see Felicity Jones get ill and die in A Monster Calls, or go for some escapist nonsense instead. It was a grey miserable January day, so La La Land won. It was pretty enjoyable, too. Ryan Gosling did a great job of being, e, Ryan Gosling pianist / keyboard player (which is pretty cool in itself)... and Emma Stone was absolutely fantastic as his love interest. One of her audition scenes reminded me of the incredibly powerful audition Naomi Watts does in Mulholland Drive, and that might not be a co-incidence judging from La La Land's locations. Ultimately a musical is going to stand or fall on the quality of its songs, and I'm not sure these will pass the test of time... but the whole movie was well done and a good romantic night out - unless you go along with someone you are not totally sure you want to spend the rest of your life with.",7,5,11,17 January 2017
