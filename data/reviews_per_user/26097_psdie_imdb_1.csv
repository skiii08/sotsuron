","Good pacing and an entertaining plot that actually more or less holds together until the have-your-cake-and-eat-it feel good ending! We're assured that this 'isn't time travel' by fame-hungry inventor Dr. Rutledge, and are content with the explanation that the protagonist is simply exploring the last 8 minutes of memory extracted from one of the incident victims. But then the 'post pause' ending contradicts this, with brain activity apparently continuing beyond when possible, and an allusion to whole parallel worlds being created. Hmmmm.Despite that, an entertaining, reasonably original flick, with Gyllenhaal ever watchable as usual, and a solid performance from the little known Vera Farmiga.",8,0,1,26 July 2011
