The Blair Witch Project," Literally visceral impact from a simple, clever idea
","My response to this film was influenced most by my reaction to the relentless jumpiness of the hand-held cameras.  I must have a low tolerance for this kind of thing (I've had the same reaction trying to playing computer video games), but by the middle of TBWP I thought I'd have to leave the theater, I was feeling so nauseated.  I tried to exercise some control by looking away from the screen but my eyes were drawn back there because I wanted to see what was going on!  I thought that I might see something that the characters didn't.  Considering that I knew the premise beforehand, I was astounded at how much of a rise the movie got out of me, and I must admit that I bought the whole thing.  Even their continuing to film after they were scared seemed acceptable as an attempt on the characters' part to maintain some kind of distance and control.  Bravos all around.",8,1,1,1 August 1999
The Mummy," Eyes Wide Open, PUL-EEESE!
","Great to look at, I mean GREAT to look at, but when there are no special effects (truth to tell, not often) it sags.  It's going for that thrill/comedy thing that 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' defined for modern audiences, but, Harrison Ford, Come back! We forgive you for 'Regarding Henry'!!!  Eye candy for sure and a couple of good scares.",6,0,0,15 May 1999
Notting Hill," Pleasant performers in overlong fantasy
","Certainly the best vehicle Julia Roberts has had in a while, and reconfirming Hugh Grant's diffident charm (and hair), NOTTING HILL is, however, paced much too slowly and has at least one superfluous complicating event to try the audience's patience.  There are some nice British-y supporting performances, and a lovely passage-of-time sequence.  Much better than YOU'VE GOT MAIL or THE LOVE LETTER.",6,0,0,1 June 1999
The Sixth Sense," Surprisingly moving, offbeat drama of therapist and child
","The trailer hadn't prepared me for a film as thoughtful, big-hearted, and, well, spiritual as THE SIXTH SENSE turned out to be.  Bruce Willis as the therapist, Toni Collette as the mother, Haley Joel Osment as the kid and an unrecognizable Donnie Wahlberg as another key patient all give credible performances, and in the case of Osment, a heartbreaking portrait of a child encased in his all-too-real fears.  Has a Bruce Willis movie EVER moved me to tears?  Well, this one did.",9,0,0,12 August 1999
