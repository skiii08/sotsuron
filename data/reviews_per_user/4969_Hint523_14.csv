The New World," Like going to a scenery art gallery
","The new world had posters advertising it about 13 months before it came out. Then when it did come out, it lasted a week. About 17 months after I'd heard of the movie, I finally saw it on DVD.TNW has a very interesting premise: a new take on the classic Phocahonatas story. It had a lot of potential going into it. But watching the movie, it is as if Terrence Mallik fired all of his crew except for the cinematographer. Every shot is like a painting, landscapes of fields and other places. Even scenes with people look like they've been painted. Because of just landscape, the movie feels so empty. No characters are developed, the plot seems weak, and I found myself counting the minutes until it would be over. I was bored out of my mind.This movie is for the kind of people who can go into an art gallery and sit at one painting for an hour, move to another for another hour, and continue like that. Mallik should have just made a collection of paintings and called them 'The New World.'Despite having an all-star cast, a promising newcomer, and a story I've always enjoyed hearing, this movie was easily the biggest let-down of the year.",4,2,7,6 May 2007
Public Enemies," Offers Nothing New
","Movies about cops and robbers are as old as movies themselves. We've seen hundreds of versions of bank robberies and yet somehow we're still drawn to the very nature of breaking the law. So in that sense, Public Enemies offers nothing new. It is as formulaic as movies get in this world of crime. Formulaic is not always bad – but movies require something new as well to keep me entertained.Set in 1933 during the Depression, John Dillinger is Public Enemy #1 and we see him on many accounts robbing banks, escaping the seemingly useless lawmen, and murdering people who get in his way. Johnny Depp plays Dillinger the same way he plays Jack Sparrow (and many others) only without the make-up: he is an upbeat and likable bad guy. And in this one he somehow manages to be chewing gum throughout it all. He squares off against a countless number of ugly cops in suits, led by none other than Christian Bale. Bale doesn't add anything to the film. It is truly unfortunate that Mr. Bale hasn't really done much good lately; he seems to be dead weight in all of his recent films (Terminator Salvation comes to mind). In fact the last movie where I thought Bale was good was Rescue Dawn (2007). Billy Cudrup has a small role as J. Edgar Hoover, the head of this war on crime, but he doesn't do anything either, besides give us a good accent. And Marion Cotilliard, who recently won the Best Actress Oscar, has a very important role as Dillinger's girl. While she is good in scenes without Depp, she doesn't hold her own when she's with him. Giovanni Ribisi, David Wenham, Jason Clarke, and Stephen Graham (as Baby Face Nelson) round out this bloated cast. In terms of acting, this film isn't going to get any Oscar nominations.Director Michael Mann is a master of crime movies. His movie Collateral is one of my all time favorites. Since Collateral, Mann has used Digital Video –the same thing I use, and not Film, to shoot all his movies, creating a look as if it is a movie made by a very good amateur. This was great in Collateral, adding some realism to the LA modern-day film, but does it work in a 1933 Crime movie? I think it's fine, but it doesn't add anything to it. And once more we see another director using the 'Paul Greengrass Effect' – shooting the action sequences so close up and with hand-held cameras that we sometimes don't get what is going on. While I respect Mann for bringing something new to this period piece, I don't think it is justified, and I don't find it impressive.There are two scenes that I really enjoyed – I loved the scene where Dillinger walks into the police department, and I loved the last scene of the film. Other than that, a large amount of the movie was predictable, too long, and most of all generic. The screenplay itself feels like it is stealing parts from other great ones – on a couple occasions I heard movie lines that were straight out of Bonnie and Clyde, which this film seems to rip off of in plot as well. Here's a movie with a dream cast and director, and yet still we get a mediocre picture. Public Enemies will not be remembered as one of the great heist films, and in fact, I don't think Public Enemies will really be remembered for anything at all. My Rating: 5/10",5,33,66,3 July 2009
Hot Fuzz," Fuzzy at first
","Hot Fuzz starts out with laugh out loud joke one after another. By the time the main character has moved into the town, I've laughed at least a dozen times.The story is about a cop, fuzz, johnny law, whatever you want to call him, whose been reassigned to a small town because he's making everyone 'look bad' so they put him in the town with the least number of crimes in England. Soon enough he realizes that all sorts of people are being killed, and while everyone in the town thinks it's all 'accidental', this guy knows something is up. Slowly he unravels the murders and whose behind it, but still nobody will believe him. Step after step leads to a half an hour shootout where every bloody death you can imagine happens... at least twice. All of a sudden a movie that started out hilarious ends up being way too much gore.While a lot of the deaths are hilarious, it gets old fast. Wright and Pegg are trying to make an homage, but instead it becomes just like the others: pointless violence. I would have liked to see just comic violence, no blood. THEN it would have been a 10/10.Still, a good show",8,0,0,6 May 2007
500 Days of Summer," 500 Days of Summer Movie Review
","I got to see this film for free, in an advance screening and the Denver premiere (because of my membership in the LTFC and DFC). It was a full theater, and I almost didn't make it in, because only the first 120 people got in. To top off a full theater, the air conditioning was broken, so my sunburned back worked up quite a sweat, but that's already more than you need to know.The tag line says, 'This is not a love story, this is a story about love', which couldn't be truer. For all of the lame romantic comedies (rom-coms) that believe they have something fresh to offer, I have yet to see one that does, until now. This is for a number of reasons, but most obviously, this is about the man, not the woman. And this is an ordinary guy, not some Hollywood hunk. They're also all very formulaic, and from the very opening scene of the film, in which we learn that our two leads are in a sticky situation, we know that this isn't the case. 'Summer' offers everything with a fresh and very indie plate, but one that tastes good as well.The story follows Tom (Joseph Gordon-Leavitt) who is a greeting card writer, and a talented one at that. One day his boss gets a new assistant, Summer (Zooey Deschanel) who is sort of the typical indie girl (the only generic part of this film). We learn about their relationship in a mixed fashion, we scan through the titular 500 days in a jumbled order, started with 250- something and moving to 1, then going back to 260-something. For the first 30-odd days Tom is too nervous to talk to her, other than small talk in elevators and such, but his crush on her is ever-present to the audience. Finally they meet, and when they do it's movie magic, despite that we already know that something major goes wrong. Now that description does no justice to the brilliance of the story. I can't describe it without revealing much, but it's a carefully woven story pattern that is top-notch, and just as important, feels more realistic than any other rom-com I've ever seen. I could relate to Tom so much on his struggles with his woman, and that coming from a kid it extraordinary. I imagine it will click even better to the lonely 20-something men out there, who I'll join before I know it. Mind you, realistic is different than plausible, but that's a topic for a different post.Did I mention that this film is hilarious? Not rom-com funny, laugh out loud hilarious. And that's another element that's missing from these romance flicks. Realistic problems and confrontations are much funnier than the silly slapstick ones in the long haul.Marc Webb's direction feels like a good indie music video, and that makes sense seeing that's all he's done before this. He alludes to his background with a very funny dance number that puts most movie musicals to shame. The editing is also fantastic, and some of the best I've seen on this type of work (comparing it to Thelma and Bourne isn't fair). And the actors are fantastic, and let's pray for some Golden Globe nominations for Zooey and Joe. But of all the elements, the screenplay deserves the most praise. Creating a realistic, funny, romantic, enjoyable, feel-good, and out of order story is incredibly hard to do. I will remember this film on my roster in the Best Original Screenplay category, even if it gets out shined everywhere else.Overall, it's a fantastic, funny, and memorable film, and it puts all other romantic comedies, indie romances, and feel good-flicks to shame. Don't let the mediocre trailer deceive you – this film is a 10/10",10,4,8,11 August 2009
Match Point," You will be SHOCKED
","Match Point begins and ends with Opera music in the credits. As being a fan of Operas, I realized the story itself is an opera. The story is about a tennis obsessed man who moves to England to become a tennis coach (one for beginners), but realizes tennis isn't going to make a life since he's good, but not pro level good. But, he gets lucky when he gets a certain pupil. This man is the very wealthy son of one of the richest men in England. Of course, the two become fast friends when they find a common interest in Opera, and many things lead to another. Soon he meets the man's sister, and the two become fast lovers, too fast. But trouble arises when the two get married and then he meets his future sister-in-law, an American girl played by Scarlett Johannson, and the two secretly have sex. Then she breaks up with his brother in law, and so now she's single, and despite his marriage, the two have an affair that lasts for a long time, all secret of course.The movie's plot thickens later for other reasons, and the man gets caught between the two women he loves, and he must face his options. What makes it good is you NEVER expect what happens. Highly recommended for boys and girls of all ages (to a point, I'm not saying a 6 year old would enjoy it)",10,1,5,18 June 2006
Nacho Libre," Nacho No Funny Libre
","It seems as if Jack Black is foreign to comedy. Actually, I retract that statement. Jack Black is foreign to marketing a film. I would have loved this movie, 10/10 if he hadn't given away ALL of the funny jokes in the commercials. There were jokes that I was laughing out loud at during the commercials, but it was the same joke again. The first line of the movie (meant to be funny) is on all the commericials.THis movie could have been a great film, and is if you haven't seen ANY commercials for it. But it was pretty dumb, funny dumb.Do not expect any more laughs than you saw on the commercialThere is no more needed to say about this movie",3,7,14,19 December 2006
The Bourne Ultimatum," The Bourne Ultimatum
","Going into this movie, all I had heard was how fantastic this movie was, from friends AND critics. I had to put it to the test.I saw both the past Bourne films. While I enjoyed them, I would hardly call myself a fan. I gave the first a 7/10 and the second a 5/10. But when there is 100% positive reviews for a film, it's a must see.Bourne is all over the world in this one with a simple goal: to find out who he was. Meanwhile, a new bad guy, the guy from Good Night and Good Luck, is on his tail trying to kill him so that secrets about the CIA are not spilled. Helping him are the two women from the last movie: Joan Allen and Julia Stiles.The action scenes are constant. This is good, the movie's pace never goes down. But I have one major complaint that almost ruined the movie for me. Paul Greengrass, the director, is not only obsessed with hand-held, but also with extremely close shots during action. Through two of the major fight sequences, I had no idea what was going on because I couldn't see anything. The camera was so close you were confused.But the fact that the plot is fantastic is what saves the movie. This plot is one of the best I've ever seen in an action movie. Period. So, while the directing is poor, the screenplay and story pull the weight making it a great movie.",9,2,4,24 August 2007
No Country for Old Men," Dark, Scary, and Fantastic
","I have loved every one of the Coen's dark comedies, and they all have the same great edge to them. However, their latest film, No Country For Old Men, is no such film. The film focuses on three characters. Josh Brolin as Llewellyn, a poor veteran who stumbles upon 2 million dollars, Javier Bardem as Anton Chirguh, a sociopath who is after the money and will let nothing get in his way. Bardem gives the best performance because he is so inhumane but attempts to have mercy. He is one of the scariest villains I have ever seen. Lastly Tommy Lee Jones as Ed Tom Bell, the sheriff who follows their footsteps. The film is mostly told through Jones's character, but all three characters have their own moments where they are telling the story. Every year comes a film that makes you grip your seat. This is the one. The whole movie feels so real as Brolin and Bardem play cat-and-mouse with one another. Part of the reality is that there is no music, and there is no soundtrack playing in the background in real life, and without the music you feel more in the movie, like it is happening to you. The Coen brothers know exactly what they are doing and as a result they make the best movies. 10/10 or A",10,3,7,20 December 2007
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Here's what I can say:
","I enjoyed this film quite a lot, but I have a lot of complaints. I felt the beginning was top notch, interesting, and made me think the whole film was going to be great. However, the film slowly eased off and got progressively worse as it went on. I noticed this when the person I was sitting next to (who originally looked quite engaged) was asleep. One of the strengths of the beginning was the amount of fantastic characters with interesting stories. As the film went on, the minor characters slowly disappeared, until all that remained were the two leads. At the end of the film it shows all of the characters, and NONE of them were introduced after the second half, they were all from the beginning. That was a clear sign of weakness. The second half seemed to be more of a quick explanation on what happened to Benjamin. It was frustrating that the second half was quick and didn't do anything more, and after choosing to go to a long film, you would expect for a good finish. But it wasn't. Another part of the film I thought that weakened it was the lack of purpose. No real message was gotten out of the film. Nothing to leave you with. It was a pretty simple story, and it was entertaining, but moving - no way. And for a heavy Oscar favorite, I would expect a bit better. Not to mention it's insane similarity to Forrest Gump, but that's another story.A generous 7/10",7,1,3,22 January 2009
Wimbledon," Have you ever seen a more predictable movie?
","Wimbledon tells the lame tale of a regular tennis player who suddenly becomes king of the bling, and wins the tennis tournament. For starters, if your 118th in the world, you ain't gonna win the biggest hot-shot tournament in a week. But Hollywood has to make a sappy movie, and in order for that he HAS to win. Next most predictable thing: the romance. It follows the basic, lame, step-by-step romantic stuff. 1. Boy Accidentally Meets Girl 2. They Bond, do something together. 3. For some reason, they are not meant to be together, but they stay together. 4. Boy or Girl does something not good that ruins it all 5. They apologize in some obscure way. 6. A Happy, sappy ending. So Wimbledon is a horrible film, and should not have earned a dollar in profits.",2,8,16,18 March 2005
Blood Diamond," Djimon Hounsou steals the show
","I saw Blood Diamond a couple months ago in theaters.It's the story of Solomon, a fisherman (Hounsou) who loses his family, and then is sent to a diamond digging camp. It takes place during the infamous civil war of Sierra Leone. Men who don't give up the diamonds are killed. But he stumbled upon a gigantic diamond. Luckily, an attack happens at the same time, so he's able to safely bury it. Through multiple events, a diamond smuggler (Dicaprio) finds out about the diamond, wants it for his own reasons, and forces Solomon to lead him back to where he buried it. All Solomon really wants is to find his family, and he needs the Diamond in order to make an exchange.I can say that I think Djimon Hounsou may have given one of the best performances of the year. It's a shame he got snubbed. I also enjoyed the juggling of action and drama. Edward Zwick is probably the best at making a movie have good action scenes, and also be plot driven. The Last Samaraui is okay, and Glory is amazing.I also did like the whole relationship between Leonardo Dicaprio and Djimon Hounsou. Unlike most films, where two enemies traveling together become friends, these two still dislike each other, a more realistic portrayal.While overall it is a decent movie, I did walk away with one complaint that almost ruins the movie. First of all, Jennifer Connelly is an unnecessary addition only for the romantic plot. The romantic plot is unnecessary and has nothing to do with the story. I would have left her out completely.I also would have narrowed down the number of lucky breaks. In the film, a lot of times the characters survive because they get lucky. Luck is used accidentally too much in films. The only film that does it well is Match Point, which is about luck.Anyway, it is a good film, not perfect, but it is interesting to watch.",8,2,2,13 June 2007
Enemy at the Gates," Completely Inaccurate, Boring, Bad Rendition of Stalingrad
","I always get mad at my teachers if they rant about how historically inaccurate a movie is or how inaccurate to the book it is. But this movie makes me see why. I rented this film after doing a project on Stalingrad. I was EXPECTING inaccuracies, but oh boy how inaccurate can you get. The beginning had a good set-up, a cool map rendition of Germany's gain. Then it had an opening with the hero learning to shoot wolves with a sniper, but somehow he was afraid to shoot them. Interesting idea, but later in the movie, he is all but eager to kill the Germans. EatG then moves to him going into Stalingrad. It then gets slow and boring, and although there are tense fight scenes, in between is just a bunch of fluff. Then they decide to add in a weak love plot, which ends up being the whole movie. The ONLY movie on Stalingrad, the bloodiest battle in world history, only focuses on a dumb LOVE PLOT! But the thing that really made me see how terrible it was was the slow realization when I finally saw: this is a movie about Russians, but the characters speak English as their regular language, and have British accents. WHAT THE HECK WAS GOING THROUGH WHOMEVER'S MIND WHEN THEY MADE THIS MOVIE! I thought this movie was gonna be good, but I was blown away with how BAD it was. Do not see this movie, even if you are a Stalingrad enthusiast you will only hate it more. Rent any other film instead, this is my least favorite movie of all time.",1,11,19,14 January 2007
Up in the Air," Timing, Timing, Timing
","It's not often that I watch a movie and I really do not want it to end. When I was watching UP IN THE AIR, it felt like a long movie, but I loved every minute of it. I could've watched it all day. They say, 'Location, Location, Location' about selling things, but for movies, it is 'Timing, Timing, Timing'. Slumdog Millionaire was successful because it came at a time when we needed to see that underdog story and we needed to know about the poverty in India. Although 'City of God' is the superior film, it's timing was poor and meant that it wasn't as well received and most people have never heard of it. Up in the Air could not have been more aptly timed. It tells the story of Ryan Bingham (George Clooney), a man who makes his profession by flying around the country and personally laying off employees in the masses. He loves it – he's excellent at it, he has been doing it for so long he is incredibly efficient. At that cost, he has no ties to anyone, spending all his time on the road and not communicating with most of his family. His whole life shakes up when a young college grad Natalie (Anna Kendrick) enters the workplace offering to start doing the job via video chat, thus reducing the cost of flight, as well as shaking up Bingham's lifestyle that he has mastered. Their boss (Jason Batemen) instructs Bingham to show her the ropes and take her on his next trip. Jason Reitman has been 3 for 3 now with his movies. Thank You For Smoking was an excellent satire of consumerism, Juno was a fantastic comedy that reminded us that good dialogue alone can make a movie hilarious, and now comes Up in the Air, a much more mainstream and much more ambitious project. His direction isn't noticeable, but he certainly knows how to pick the right projects to work on. I talk a lot about how Do The Right Thing excels because of its perfect balance of comedy and drama. Up in the Air nails this, matching every scene with comedic excellence as well as emotional story. It can't really be described as either; instead it feels much more real. The characters aren't always sad, nor are the situations always funny. It feels like real life. All of the lead characters in the film feel like people we know, our friends, and we enjoy watching them do their thing. Real life is boring, but there is enough color added to it via the writing that makes you enjoy this movie and to not want it to end. It's a movie you will love watching, without necessarily rolling on the floor laughing or crying your eyes out in. The acting from the three leads (Clooney, Kendrick, and Vera Faramiga) is good and all of them carry their own weight. It helps that the script they are working with seems flawless. All of them have memorable moments. Nominations for all three is a near guarantee, but I don't think Up in the Air will be winning any acting awards. Up in the Air is just perfect in so many ways. It's layered with many ironies, as well as some great messages about life, and more importantly, whom we spend it with. I am left slightly speechless at the genuine quality of the film. It's the kind of movie I love, and it's perfect. So far, this is the best we've seen in 2009. My Rating: 10/10reelscenes.blogspot.com",10,2,8,21 December 2009
Furious 7," The Fast franchise roars forward
","While every entry of a franchise usually totes itself as the 'biggest entry yet,' never before has it been so true. I successfully managed to avoid any actual trailers or movie reviews for the eagerly anticipated Furious 7, which has defied all odds and firmly established itself as a worldwide box office juggernaut. Two summers ago in anticipating Fast and Furious 6, I rented all of the sloppily titled Fast and Furious movies (except the first one which I saw shortly after its release) to understand how exactly this franchise came to be. Unlike the superhero franchises which have a dense canon from which they are pulling stories, one of the admirable elements of this franchise is that it is not based on previous material and therefore can much more easily reinvent itself. Indeed, it's pretty amazing how well the series has managed to keep the same basic characters and story intact despite so many offshoot trajectories.The main transition the series has seen is changing the characters from street racers to elaborate heist leaders, which has allowed the series to have a lot more fun and take itself less seriously. Slowly, more characters have been added, greatly expanding the 'family' of alpha character Dominic Toretto (Diesel). The story lines have always been the weakest part, which is why fewer people have seen the middle installments, but since Fast & Furious (the fourth entry – again the titles are incredibly scattered) each movie has successfully upped the ante. I stand by Fast Five as the pinnacle of the series where it fired on all cylinders (yet even that isn't exactly an A-level action movie), with the sixth film not too far behind. In Furious 7, the mission is bigger than ever before, and feels less and less about the cars and more about spies and missions. The movie is attempting to widen the audience and be more broadly appealing than the humble originals which were all about urban street racing. Here, we go from London, to Abu Dhabi, to LA, with a few scattered cameos in between, all with massive action setups.The part that the film does extremely well of is creating a villain worthy of opposition to the protagonists. Jason Statham is in fact more bad-ass than you could ever imagine, going toe-to-toe with both Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson. Another villain is also established, played by Djimon Hounsou. In two years, three movies have underutilized him as a villain: How to Train Your Dragon 2, Guardians of the Galaxy, and now this. It is truly a shame that an Oscar nominated actor is getting commissioned to throwaway bad guy parts with no real character. Regardless, Statham is a truly awesome guy to watch and makes the film all that engaging even though he isn't given a huge chunk of time. Another character that has unfortunately been completely sidelined by the franchise is Jordana Brewster's character. In the first few movies she could stand on her own and was a pivotal member of the crew. Now, she has literally been reduced to a housewife. Without Paul Walker, I fear that her character will be slimmed down in future installments. The first half of the film is much more entertaining, while the second half feels a bit tiresome despite a few epic action sequences. Lastly, there is the inevitable question of what the film had to do regarding the unplanned passing of Paul Walker. I had no idea what they had planned, and let's just say they don't avoid the subject by any means. It is unfortunate how clearly different the ending of the film is than what they had planned – even a casual moviegoer can tell. But it's a nice enough tribute to the series co-lead. I truly do wonder what Vin Diesel and Co. will do from here moving forward. There is no right answer, but right now they've got the biggest movie yet on their hands and so much more to do. The passing of Paul Walker only heightens just how bizarre the trajectory of this franchise has gone, and while this series is certainly not the top of the line for action movies, I will remain along for the ride for any future installments that follow.",6,0,13,14 April 2015
