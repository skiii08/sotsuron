Hereditary," A tale of two cities
","Classic Horror, this movie had everything, setting, decent story line, good jump scares, the odd time you need to turn away to tune out the horror, great music score, tense build up and some really great scary moments. I loved this movie right up to the end scene and OMG how to kill a movie in one stroke. No mean feat but they managed it. They destroyed everything they had built before it and turned a great horror movie into a slap the forehead and laugh moment. Two movies spliced together. Jeanie's narrative was shameful and embarrasing. The whole concept fell flat, they should have stuck with the tried and tested method of just using the devil and leave it at that. So close yet so far, this movie should be on my collection list but the ending has relegated it to the trash bin. I'm so very disappointed.
My advice is this, after Peter's mum cuts her own head off in the attic, end the movie there and let your own imagination complete the movie, please please please, dont watch the ending it doesn't do the movie justice at all, in fact it hops the head off it as Annie did to herself the previous scene.",7,0,2,16 January 2019
