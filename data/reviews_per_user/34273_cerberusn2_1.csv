The Avengers," A ride you'll not forget soon!
","I went to this movie with very, very high expectations and to no surprise they were not only met by the movie, they were over exceeded! You almost don't have screen time without action, excellently crafted dialogs or scenes that make you laugh. Audience, including me, applauded and laughed during the movie not ones. Also, you don't have time to think about what's going to happen next in the story and that's because movie sucks you in so much, you have enough time to just be focused on what's going on right in front of you, and what's in front of you is moments you don't want to miss. On top of that, you have awesome effects and very good acting (you can't not to love Tony Stark!). This movie managed to make me feel like a little kid again and it was awesome!",10,7,15,12 May 2012
