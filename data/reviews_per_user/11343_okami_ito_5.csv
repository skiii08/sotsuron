It," The only thing creepy are the positive reviews.
","This is sub-standard run-of-the-mill horror with no story, no character-development, a ridiculous cast and worst of all: it isn't thrilling or scary at all. Just one helpless and unimaginative executed 'scare'-scene senslessly glued to the other. What a mess! There is nothing here that you haven't seen before at least a thousend times. Especially the episodes with the school-bullys are cringeworthy formulaic.
The only thing clever about this is the marketing. They sure had me thinking that this wasn't just a trashy horror-flic. After the first dull 'scary-basement' scene, i knew what i was in for. Watched ist till the end in disbelief, though. Still can't believe how boring this was. Sad.",3,5,9,8 August 2018
Hostel," From the people that brought you Guantanamo Bay!
","Frequent viewers of U.S. American movie-productions are aware of the fact that most American citizens live in constant fear of the fact, that there are foreign countries on their globe. Those of them who are bold enough to travel those dangerous territories have the wildest stories to tell. 'Hostel' is one of them. It's the kind of yarn, that's presented from little boys with a lifetime experience of TV an video-watching for those who are eager to be told the same boring crap over and over again if only their regularly dish is spiced with some extra gory details. The idea of 'Hostel' is as simple as its protagonists: Somewhere outside of the United States of America there is a very strange area. It's called Europe. Most of the time it's like a mixture of Las Vegas and Disney World but if you stretch it too hard there are dangers waiting there for you beyond your lamest imagination.The two heroes of 'Hostel' are backpackers who want to get laid. They want to have sex with European women. So they travel to Slowenia, because someone in Amsterdam told them that they will find those women there. So they travel there. (You wonder why it's taking me so long to tell this? Hey i'm talking about 60 % of the story!) On their way to Slowenia they discover that some natives eat with their hands. Creepy isn't it? After that (and after the audience is watching a real bad 'Porkys'-Rip Off for about an eternity) they finally reach the destination of their dreams. A 'hostel' that is managed like a swinger club. They are seduced by beautiful Slovenian women, dressed like prostitutes. These women are not only vile, they are evil! They lure our innocent heroes to a place where rich people can live out their sadistic fantasies by torturing people for a fee. ( I bet if such a place would really exist, the people who'd go there would have A LOT more fantasies than Elli Roth, the 'director/writer' of that 'movie'). I think i'm not 'spoiling' anyones viewing pleasure by telling that our heroes will find themselves captured in this torture theme-park, ready to be, well, tortured. When you watch this movie in a cinema, like i did, you sense a change in the audience at this point. Finally after one hour of lame sex jokes and stupid dialog the movie seems to be going somewhere. Behind me i could hear some heavy breathing. So i was getting a little curious myself because i really like violent, disturbing movies. Well, it takes at least a little fantasy and visual imagination to make a torture scene in a cheap movie work. Roth likes to brag about 'pleasing' even 'hardcore horror-fans' or 'breaking boundaries' with his fairy tale and he's not ashamed to name masters like Chan-wook Park as a reference but believe me: 'Hostel' does not deliver! It's not even worth a laugh. After some really boring torture scenes, there are some badly staged escape-scenes and some totally illogical revenge-scenes thrown in for good measure. So a movie that, in the hands of a more talented young director (f.e. Alexandre Aja) , could have been at least cheap fun turns out to be just...cheap. And stupid. And just for your information, college boys: the official language in Slowenia, the Czech Republik and the Netherlands isn't German. If it would be, the Germans would have won world war II. And that is (in opposite of 'Hostel') a real terrifying idea.Watch the much more terrifying 'Wolf Creek' or the brilliant 'The Descent' instead of wasting precious time with juvenile babble.",1,3,7,14 March 2006
"I, Robot"," Robocop with no brains.
","This is a movie about how human machines can turn out but is itself such a heartless, mechanical and stiff experience that one can have the impression that it was made entirely by robots. By robots who ain't got a glue how to make a movie work, of course. The action- scenes make you think of most boring expositions of some mindless computer-games, Will Smith is totally lost in some scenes and the gun-play must be the most ridiculous to be seen since Hollywood started copying hong Kong movies way back in the nineties. There is a scene when a robot informs Smith about some 2000 stairs he has to climb. Watching that movie was like climbing those stairs in a very dull stairway. That's how ultimately boring this movie is.",2,2,4,29 October 2005
Saw II," Enough mistakes for two bad movies
","After reading much praise on this website and having sort of liked the first part i went to see 'Saw II' yesterday. And man, were those praises wrong. The idea that there are people out there who actually think that this is a good horror movie is more scary than anything in this ineptly made crap. The acting is bad enough but who really has outdone himself is the editor of this movie who puzzles together the wildly hand-shaken parts without any feeling for rhythm or atmosphere at all. It's really a pain to watch bad movies like this, because their makers do real annoying pseudo-hip stuff to hide the fact that they have no talent for this sort of thing ( making horror work). It's good to see that the 'new wave' of horror movies is trying to keep a straight face like in the good old days but while watching 'Saw II' you can learn why there were so many 'comic' slashers and monsterflics through the 90ies. Because with a crew like this and a director like Bousman it's gonna be a pretty ridiculous time no matter how hard they try to make this trash work. In opposite to the first part, there is no love in this, just ignorance. Believe me.",3,3,6,9 March 2006
The Departed," Most annoying soundtrack.
","Frankly, i think Scorcese suffers from a personality crisis for quite some time. This movie is another example that this director, who made milestones of Hollywood history once, totally lost his style and constantly tries to follow tired trends. That he's successful with it, tells more about his audience then the quality of his recent movies. A good example for this is the nerve-wrecking soundtrack of this mediocre remake, which dive-bombs the viewer with one blaring rock song after another. Who does Scorcese thinks he is? Quentin Tarantino? It would be excusable for a beginner to over-spice his first movie with his favorite mix-tape. I like music and i like movies. What i don't like is to be pestered with someones dated musical taste when i want to see a gangster-movie. My God, just read the list of songs at the end credits. It's insane! You have to be numb to endure this.",5,3,4,7 March 2014
