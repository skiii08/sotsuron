The Blair Witch Project," its ok
","Blair Witch Project neither *stinks* nor does it live up to the hype about it.  i would give it 5 out of 10 stars, and the only reason it would rate that high in my opinion is because it IS original.  During this film, several people got up and simply left, my friend included....she said the film gave her a bad case of motion sickness.  Immediately after the film, there were many loud exclamations from all over the theater, such as *that sucked,* * what a bulls*** movie,* etc, etc.  Many of my friends are positively livid in their expressions of anger over what they consider *a piece of crap which i was suckered into seeing by the critics.* Personally, i really REALLY wanted to like this movie....some of my favorite online movie critics, including my very fave, Scott Renshaw, gave this movie 10 out of 10 stars, calling it *brilliant,* a *masterpiece,* etc.  To me, Blair Witch is original, pretty well-acted, a little creepy, not scary, kinda funny, mostly boring.  This film could have been SO MUCH SCARIER and BETTER: the premise is great, and the acting was good, but the buildup of tension just was not there to any substantial degree.  A BIG disappointment.",1,0,3,17 August 1999
Se7en," a masterpiece
","Se7en is simply a masterpiece--one of the most disturbing movies ever made. Profound, intelligent, visceral, compelling, and masterful describe this chilling look at the mind and methods of a literate, brilliant and articulate serial killer.  Persons who like shallow, escapist entertainment with lots of explosions will probably not like Se7en, which deals with very deep and disturbing issues, and actually requires the viewer to THINK, unlike most movies today.  The film is not perfect, as no film is ever perfect, but the few minor flaws (there are no major ones, in my opinion) are far, far outweighed by the things this movie does right.  The acting by Freeman, Pitt, Paltrow and the unbilled killer is uniformly top-notch; the dark, gothic quality of much of the movie compliments the subject matter quite well; the music is haunting and spare; the gore and implied violence are never gratuitous, but merely to serve as important and visceral indications of the mindset of the killer, who chooses his victims and murders them according to the Seven Deadly Sins of literature: Gluttony, Sloth, Lust, Envy, Pride, Greed, and Wrath.  The climax is a gut-wrenching finish to one of the most compelling movies ever made. I suspect that many people who do not *like* this movie and criticize various aspects of it are more disturbed by it than they would admit--it is not for everyone. One of the best films of the 90s, and superior to Silence of the Lambs.",Null,0,0,16 August 1999
From Dusk Till Dawn," A WILD RIDE
","WOW!!  From Dusk til Dawn is literally drenched in violence, gore, profanity and topless women.....the ultimate guy movie.  This movie is extreme in every way, and definitely not for the faint-hearted.  George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino are the Gecko brothers, a couple of criminals who are on the run, having killed several people in a bank robbery, and then a few more as they flee.  Clooney's character is evil, to be sure, but only kills when it is *necessary;* Tarantino's character, on the other hand, is a sexual predator and killer who flies into rages and sometimes kills for no good reason.  The pair stop at a seedy motel, run across a father (Harvey Keitel)and his two children (the daughter: Juliette Lewis) who stop at the motel, and take the three hostage, using their RV as cover to get across the border into Mexico.  Clooney's character has arranged a rendezvous with some criminals in Mexico, who will get 30% of the money the Gecko's stole from the bank.  The rendezvous point is an infamous bar out in the middle of nowhere: the Titty Twister, which is *open from dusk til dawn.*  Once the brothers, with their hostages in tow, have bullied their way into the establishment, the action REALLY begins.  Lets just say that the bar is not what it appears to be...  For those who want high-energy, extreme entertainment, this is a great movie. 10/10",Null,0,0,21 September 1999
