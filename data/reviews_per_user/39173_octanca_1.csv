The Lobster," incoherent,indecent and insane
","First of all the word comedy has no place in its description: comedy: A film, play, or broadcast program intended to make an audience laugh (Oxford dictionary). It is a shame to see few great names into this movie: Incoherent, Indecent and Insane. A brilliant mind is the opposite of this movie. During this movie I was several times tempted to run away and let the finish of this movie for these that really regret any penny spent onto this movie. As long as this review shall have minimum of 10 lines of text, I will add another think: do not bring kids to this movie if you worked hard until now to them education.",1,37,63,24 January 2016
