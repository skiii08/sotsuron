Scarface," Best mobster film, ever.
","Al Pacino's best performance as Tony Montana, a cuban prisoner released by Castro during the 'Bay of Pigs'. He works his way up in America, building his own American Dream. He quickly rises through a drug cartel and eventually controls it, holding onto it however, is even harder for him.Goodies include extreme violence (the chainsaw scene comes to mind), excessive gunfights/drug usage, and the usual language and nudity.The film is very, very long, but worth it.",10,0,0,20 January 1999
Apocalypse Now," Coppola's stunning vision of the Vietnam War.
",Truly the first war movie that sat aside all propaganda and viewed it like it was. This is no 'Green Berets' folks. The film is quite adept at showing the accuracy of morale and general conduct in the war.,10,0,0,20 January 1999
Amadeus," Wonderful ... Brilliant ... Amazing!
","This film is truly a work of art. The interweaved plot of actual history and fiction spun into a masterpeice! You need not be knowledgeable of classical music to enjoy this film, but must be able to tolerate it, as the music underscores the entire film.Stunning performances given by F. Murry Abraham and Thomas Hulce deliver, in my eyes, one of the 10 best films of all time!",10,3,6,20 January 1999
