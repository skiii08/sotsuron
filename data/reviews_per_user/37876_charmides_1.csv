Alien 3," Highly under-appreciated and misunderstood
","Although it is the weakest of all the 'Alien' films, Alien 3 is still a worthy member of the franchise, though a highly under-appreciate and misunderstood film.The directorial debut of the now famous David Fincher ('Seven','Panic Room'), it is gorgeously shot film, with fine performances from the main cast, who were all respected actors in their own right.The film has a gothic feel, not present in the previous two, making it not so much an action/horror film and more of a long dark suspense thriller, with plenty of blood and gore.It suffers from a poor script, which was constantly re-hashed and re-written during the shoot, and terribly predictable plot-devices, which were a feeble attempt to re-capture the feel of the first film.However,the cinematography, the sets, the sweeping score by Elliot Goldenthal, and the stunningly beautiful and tragic ending make it two hours well spent.",6,2,4,16 January 2004
