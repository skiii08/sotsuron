The Equalizer," FFS Denzel!! Why?
","NOT a remake of the great 80' series starring the imperious Edward Woodward. With that out of the way, I will begin.. Denzel plays a man living a fruitless existence, trapped in his thoughts of a shadowy and chequered past. So far so good as Denzel appears to have slipped back into the acting mode which has been sadly missing for so many years. A brooding and thoughtful performance some might say. I'm really beginning to enjoy myself at this stage. BANG!!!! I really cannot begin to explain my disappointment as Denzel suddenly descends into killing mode. How many ways can a human being kill another human being( lots). Typical formulaic Hollywood crap ensues. None of the action is even remotely original! A total bore fest for the remaining 90 mins, leaves me clambering for the exit as the end credits being to roll.All In all this has been done before and to far greater effect in Taken. At least Taken doesn't pretend to be something it isn't .",2,18,38,8 October 2014
