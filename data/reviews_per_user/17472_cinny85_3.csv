Iron Man 3," The best of three.
","What a super fantastic super hero movie this is! THE best of the Iron Man Trilogy (assuming that this is the last Iron Man).Ben Kingsley could not have done a better job with his role as Trevor Slattery. He was hilarious. The film itself had many clichés and we can hardly pretend that we didn't know what was going to happen, it's a super hero movie after all. So what makes this different from any other comic book brought to life on the silver screen? Robert Downey Jr. He is the best choice for a role that I've come across in years. I truly cannot see anyone else filling his shoes as Tony Stark. Tony Stark is an arrogant rich bastard who you will want to hate, but can't. He is the kind of man you want to punch in the face punch again and then kiss it better. Or if you're a straight man, reach out your hand to help him up and pad him on the shoulder. His sarcasm is perfectly timed and executed and Robert Downey Jr. seems to just naturally have that. One of the key ingredients that makes this such a MARVELous film.Pepper Pots never came across as a helpless, defenceless woman, but in this film she really gets to show how spicy she can be, throwing all kinds of emotions at you in a single scene towards the end.There were several moments which were suggestive teasers for the upcoming Avengers movie; Age Of Ultron. I truly cannot wait!",9,0,2,11 July 2014
Hotel Transylvania," Vamptastic
","91 minutes never passed so quickly while watching an animated film. This is such a great production! The voice actors were fantastic and perfect for their characters. This is a story about a vampire who's wife was murdered by humans. He decides to protect his daughter by keeping her as far away from them as possible. He takes drastic actions to make sure it stays that way for as long as he can. Then one day, by pure chance, a man of the human kind walks into their lives and to make matters worse; his daughter falls head over heals for this unwelcome guest. It is a really funny, heart warming and moving story that both young and old can enjoy. The jokes are subtle, perfectly timed and with the main two male characters being brilliant comedians, this was perfectly executed. Even the Dutch version is really funny. It is a film I can see over again.",8,0,2,16 July 2014
Lucy," uses 80% of it's full potential
","This may or may not contain spoilers.I just been through a few reviews and considering this film only has a 6.6 out of ten at the time of this review, I can tell this film was too complicated for some people. It is a great piece of art, unique in many ways. Although it also has a lot of clichés, it was a pleasant film to watch. It's not often that I see a film of this genre where a woman plays the lead without having to get naked. It actually has a life lesson to teach us and it's not the lesson we are learning which seems to be that sex sells.This film is trying to teach us that knowledge is power. Not the power that many people want i.e. the power to control others to benefit themselves, but the knowledge to grow, to get further in life.... together! To reach our full and true potentials.Some scenes could have used more action, some of the dialogue could have been performed with more passion, but overall it was a good, clean and intelligent piece of work that I wouldn't have missed for the world.... but just as happily would have watched on blu-ray in the comfort of my own home.SPOILER: well, kind of; if you're like me and sit through the credits in the hope of a teaser, there won't be one.",8,17,38,4 August 2014
