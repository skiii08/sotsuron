The Lobster," Artsy Fartsy Boredom
","What a God Awful film this is. The only thing worth looking is the performance of Colin Farrell. Thats it.The rest of the film is so boring, the title of the movie could actually be 'The Boring Movie'. Nothing really happens in the entire film so it may easily carry this title.Artsy fartsy is the common description here, including direction, acting, casting....you name it, it's horrible, cheap and uninspiring in any way possible. They probably thought the audience would find this idea surrounded by waves of boredom interesting. In some sort of weird way. Unfortunately this is not film making, it's called sleeping in our chairs while this film plays on.If this didn't have Colin Farrell in it, you would probably never have watched it anyways. Farrell gives a solid performance I really liked it, but he looked totally out of place, given the terrible soundtrack and co-casting. I recommend this film to be made again from scratch with Farrell and a much better crew, it could be made much much better.NEXT !!!",1,123,218,14 May 2016
First Man," 2 Hours Of Shaky Cam
","This is the first movie to use exclusively a camera man with Parkinson's desease. The entire movie is filmed with a camera taped on a kitchen mixer on super speed.Not only it gave me a headache 5 minutes in, but all the scenes are shot with a shaky cam. Even dinner and funeral scenes are shaky cam all over the place. 2 hours of the worst camera work since the dawn of moving pictures.The entire film was so shaky that at the end you think even the ending credits are shaking too.What a terrible and useless film. Wanna get dizzy with a headache ? Watch this movie. Then take a couple of painkillers with a couple of shots of whiskey and try to forget all about it.Dont say I didnt warn you about the headaches. Just make sure you didnt have a big meal before the movie...Id rather watch a found footage movie than this. And I hate found footage films.",3,9,15,27 November 2018
The Expendables 2," Better that the 1st one
","No flowing around Mickey Rourke scenes, no delay (except the bike meeting with Maggie..), just straight through action movie.Trying to be old style and fake it, fails. Because you already have lone wolves on screen. You cannot fake that, just shoot it likewise. Very irritating.It's better than the first almost in every aspect, if one could look out for it, anyways...I enjoyed it and didn't scroll it (well maybe I scrolled to the JCVD fight, which was cool and cruel)Does not qualify for a classic in my book. It has a very strong contemporary sequel feeling to it. But then again, even that Li was replaced 5min in the movie, it leaves open wide, an aspect of finally putting the classic characters back to their seats.You have to respect that, even if it sounds tough, there it is. Who did it ? Stallone ? Good for him and the other 80's Christmas trees he hangs out with in his movie.Arnie, Sly and Willis switching lines between their famous films, that I found very entertaining, clever little (big budget ?) choice right there.I do support Sly and his crappy, old, cheap, true, heartfelt movies. I suppose in the end, muscle never really took first place in his movies, no matter what all the people saw on screen. That's what Sly has to put in again on his films. (If he makes it)Have a good one.",5,1,2,8 March 2013
Skyfall," Something's gotta give.
","I put the Skyfall movie on and said I wasn't gonna like it.Well I did like it. This time around, I even liked that darn Albanian 007 guy, who carried his old drunk bum outta that fancy beach and went home to fight with the rusty old shotgun and the geriatrics for a back up.It's all good on this one, I never read any 007 books but this film makes me wanna just read them all.Finally a darker 007 intro for a darker 007 film.I didn't like the last key character replacements. Although I waited the entire movie to see that last part, it felt very rushed in and fast. Like something that can be replaced too fast again. If you know what I mean. But since it is very realistic, I suppose I could agree at the end.Something's gotta give.",7,0,3,3 March 2013
Hereditary," 2 Hours Of Nothingness
","Here is a serious issue with this movie. The horror fans can indentify it right away.This story has been done before since the dawn of the horror genre. And it was done with lots of blood and gore throughout the movies. So now we get the same movie with the same occult story but without the blood and gore. It is stupid.If it is supposed to satisfy a small group of fans of this kind of movies, great. Release the movie just to these fans. The rest of the world wants blood and gore and jump scares in an occult horror movie genre. It is called entairtainment. You go watch the movie and then go home. You dont start doing research and watch other videos just to understand what is going on in a movie and force yourself to like it. It is a movie. Not a college essay.I give this movie a low rating. It does not qualify as a horror movie and because somebody out there even thought to compare it with one of the greatest movies of all times.Bottom line, there is no such thing as a slow burning horror film. It is confusing. Just do a horror film man. The fans will like it more than this new horror movies which you spend two hours to see nothing and the last 15 minutes is something you have already seen probably in an old Christopher Lee movie in the 1960's with more blood.Give me a break...",4,3,9,25 June 2018
Gravity," Oh My God Rhino, 3 Bars ?!
","In space there's no sound. But there's a strong soundtrack and a guy holding a camera filming in 3D, in space.Pretty impressive camera shots right there. Not including any actual acting from the actors in those shots.The soundtrack is very good but the dialogues needed a lot of work. Scriptwise and soundwise. Since it is the strong point as we don't really see much of the actors because of the space suits.The film does have some terror facts, it lacks the psychological profiles that tend to blend in really well with the expensive visuals.Point being taken , it's a survival movie in space. Thats it. Straight cut with impressive effects. And where are the actors ? Final Verdict : It sucks and it should have an alien psycho twist like the Solaris movie. George Clooney doesn't make space junk look pretty. Not if he dies 35 minutes into the movie, and the space junk is flying away until the end of the film.",3,0,2,30 November 2013
Creed," Awful movie
","This is not actually a movie rather than a Jordan shoes and chemo2 hour commercial.I turned off the film the moment I saw Rocky training Jordan while doing chemo. Who writes this crap anyways. Who's idea was it to give Rocky cancer ? Maybe in the next film Rocky dies, goes to Hell and trains Apollo Creed to fight the Devil. What a load of crap.Everybody at one point made fun of the Rocky saga because one day we would see Rocky dying of old age but still fighting in the ring. Stallone actually made a Rocky film out of this joke. This is really weird.What's next ? Adrian in spandex, The Rocky Chronicles ?The Rocky saga has been milked to it's last breath with this one.Appolo's abandoned screwed up kid, a deaf girlfriend who is a singer, Rocky has cancer, Adrian, Paulie, Mickey, Appolo, Appolo's wife are all dead. Everybody is dead but yet Sly filmed Rocky 67 movie and had a director who has never directed a film before. ErrrGive me a break man, it is a failed attempt to do a sports drama movie all the way to the grave. Stallone did an excellent drama job with the first movies and no one was dead or dying.I have only one message to Mr.Stallone. Let the Rocky saga be, man. Just let it go. You don't need the money and we don't need a Rocky movie inspired by a school joke from 1985.",3,32,58,10 December 2015
The Hateful Eight," I should have watched Star Wars
","The 3 stars go to Kurt Russel, the rest gets absolutely nothing from me.Another movie which is not a movie. Mediocre to nothing to say the least.You just sit there for 2 hours waiting for something to kick in the movie, but nothing. I thought this had some very good potential the first 30 to 40 minutes, after that, I guess Quentin had a couple of joints and went to bed.I thought Tarantino made some good movies but not this time. Maybe he's getting old, getting bored. I don't know.I hate Disney, but this time around, they were right. Tarantino's movie sucks and shouldn't open side by side with Star Wars. It's like one of these movies you used to discover in the video stores and say 'Oh, is this another Tarantino movie ? Never heard of it'Three stars and that's it. I don't even want to download this movie or watch it with my friends.Throwing up blood on somebody's face over and over doesn't cut it for me man. So many good actors in this movie and you did nothing for them. Nothing.NEXT !!",3,66,134,30 December 2015
The Expendables," Shapeshifting Faces Of Stallone
","Has anyone noticed Stallone's face these days ? It's not just his age he looks like a shapeshifter that shapeshifts but not exactly. His face is like melting down on him and that strange looking ears are really disgusting to look at. Stallone looks very bored and drunk as hell in every scene of this ghastly production and he gives us the impression that he shot this film during happy hours or something. No face expressions what so ever and he is far from average acting, he just stands there with his melted face and draws his guns.Jet Li takes the cake by looking extremely bored throughout the whole movie, this film could be Li's worst ever. His face seems to tell us 'please get on with it I have to go and do something else....' even during his stupid fight scenes.What the hell does Crews have to do with this film I just don't get it. He is great fun in his own feutures but in this one I guess Sly hired him just to say that single famous line after the shotgun massacre and thats about it for him.Statham looks pretty cool with his hoop tricks and seems he is the only one acting out his bad ass role in some way.Arnold looks like a burned out Christmas tree from the 80's, it's very impressive that he can open his mouth and speak out two words in all.The whole new marketing image with the brand new computer graphics posters does not mix with the old pack playing in the movie, I wish Sly could promote his movie in old fashioned themes and posters, that would be interesting. Instead the posters look very 21st century with 20th century action heroes and that really sucks.Scenario was written on a coffe table watching cartoons or something.As a huge Sly fan I'm very disappointed that he tries to look very tough but he doesn't get it right anymore. There's no single line he sais that could take me inside his head and movie theme. Fail.That's All Folks !!",1,6,10,3 October 2012
Alien," Prometheus, have you seen this ??
","5 years ago I had a dream about writing this review while watching Prometheus. Maybe it was a nightmare I don't really remember.Don't you just love Sigourney when she was young ? Now she looks like the recent Sigourney swallowed the old one. Giger should tattoo her entire body with aliens. This is what it feels like, a tattoo of a movie in your head.No computer graphics here just lots of smoke and painted screens and the actual background creators did a very good job. Movie sequels, t-shirts, comic books and all kinds of very cool merchandising stuff has seen the light of day because of this movie. Can you imagine how stupid a person would look with a Prometheus t-shirt on ? yeap...This is horror based on a painter's work.",9,0,1,9 October 2012
American Sniper," Fake baby doll destroys entire film
","Mr. Eastwood seems to have lost his marbles and his 6 shooters at the end of his career.That being said, the movie was mediocre at best, if it ever reached any good moments anyways.It follows the story of Chris Kyle as an American sniper and his troubles at home. And that's about as far as it goes.There's no high points no low points in the movie, it just runs down like a hot chicken soup in a warm day. No action, no meanings no nothing. It's just a guy shooting people from rooftops.Clint tried to put in there a rivalry between 2 snipers but it was so badly made that you actually felt nothing when Kyle shot the other sniper from a mile away. The whole film was building up to that moment and Clint completely missed it in the end. It was a 'meh' moment where it should have been the peak of the film. It is a movie and not a documentary after all.This is supposed to be a true story but it wouldn't hurt to put some artistic cinematography in there so that the audience could actually relate better to what Kyle was doing the whole time he was in the war.I felt absolutely nothing, no remorse no hate no nothing about the characters, I'm just very frustrated and can't accept the fact that this is a Clint Eastwood film.Maybe he should have cast Morgan Freeman again eh ?Last thought : They spent millions of dollars to make this movie but couldn't find a baby and replaced it with a fake baby doll ? Jesus Christ Mr. Eastwood. That completely destroyed the entire film.",2,27,68,23 January 2015
Bohemian Rhapsody," Face The Troof
","The reviewers are correct. The movie plays out like a Youtube video of Queen. So why don't we all just watch a couple of Queen documenteries for free on Youtube then ? Good actors boring film. Because its like spending millions of dollars to re-shoot a Queen documentary with actors. It doesn't make any sense at all. It's like spending a million dollars to re-create a tomato rather than going to the store to buy a real one for almost no cost. The film has 'Watch the real thing on Youtube' written all over it which is not good. Don't care if Brian May or Spielberg produced it either.I'd rather watch a Freddy Mercury based movie with a complete fictional story say like a dark twisted erotic action thriller than this.The movie made me feel a bit stupid. Like when you take a photograph with your cell phone of an actual printed photograph. Or like when some people use their cell phones to take photographs of another photograph on a computer screen.They could have made an action thriller with Freddy Mercury character for the lead role. Explosions, machine guns, sex, opera houses and rock music. That would be interesting to watch. Instead they re-shot a Youtube documentary. Wake me up when Freddy Mercury is a character in Mortal Kombat video game or has his own action movies.Ideas for the producers for erotic action thrillers :Freddy Goes West, Freddy's Back, Tales from the crypt : Innudeado, High On Mercury, High On Mercury 2 The Opera House Tapes, Unshaved and loving it, The Vengeance Of Mercury, Planet Mercury etc..",3,14,28,11 November 2018

Man of Steel," Clogs Of Steel
","Kevin Costner saves the entire movie and Jor El looks and acts like some stupid Avatar sequel character.This is a sci-fi movie. Not much more than that. If you enjoy cgi stuff you will love this.Man Of Steel feels like an Iron Man 5th sequel. Reeve is probably shaking in his grave. Because the art of acting Clark Kent and Superman, gets replaced by a wide audience just staring these wonderful effects through a looking glass.Never was a big Supes fanboy and I never read the gazillions of his comic books. But this scenario is probably the worst ever. Where's the character double impact, the mystery....that scary old look on Superman's face.IMDb should have an official rating of 'Fake & Gay' so I could rate it properly.If you take away the fake computer stuff and compare it to the old films, Man Of Steel crashes and burns very badly.",3,4,9,6 July 2013
Trouble with the Curve," Fail for Mr. Eastwood
","I'd give it a 4 star because it's Clint Eastwood, even if he just shakes his hand dying for 5 seconds on his last movie.I was right this time. I didn't like it from the start. Too slow, too heartbreaking. Not to mention the endless daughter boyfriend scenes. Quite embarrassing stuff there Mr. Eastwood. You move the story away from you too far and it never comes back for me. At least not during the last scene, where it should have a Clint Eastwood ending. If you know what I mean.And what's with all that eye sight fail, too long, too many times we see Clint tripping over coffee tables, stools, stairs, burning his steak dinner and so on...c'mon.OK we've seen the heartbreaking movies, where's the other stuff ?",4,1,4,9 March 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man," The Amazing Babyman
","Obviously I haven't read the 966 reviews so far and I don't have to, but I will probably read the ones with the funniest title.Anyway back to the movie....waita minute, what movie ? No I did not see the entire movie I switched it off right on the second boyfriend girlfriend scene, where Peter Parker is stuttering for 5 minutes in front of a blonde girl.That's not a Spiderman movie. It's a DVD for kids. The reason why I switched it off and the reason why this review is incomplete. The stuttering babyman. 'Oh, Andy loved geology' no wait...I thought in my time I would get to see a good super hero movie. I was wrong so far. Dosens of Marvel movies, Batman/Superman movies....horrible horrible casting and directors. Also the past Spiderman movies were far better for my taste and patience.The best thing I saw in this movie is Martin Sheen's father role. He is kinda old but he does deliver excellent straight up acting, free from any cgi and soundtrack back-up. You can hear this man talk and you know from his first words that you have to say 'yes sir' at the end of his talk. It doesn't matter what he is saying to you. Anyway to close this wonderful review for this kid's movie, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who is over 25 years old, a serious comic book collector, an old fan or to any true spidey fans around the globe. I'm sure many hard work has gone into this movie by a lot o talented people, but this doesn't mean anything if every super hero movie is worst than the last one to most of the viewers.Thank you for reading.",1,3,16,10 December 2012
The Conjuring 2," The Yawning 2
","I must have dozed off a couple of times while the movie was on, I remember waking up with every jump scare. And then going back to sleep.What a terrible movie this is. It's not scary, at all. I can't believe people actually pay money to watch this in theaters.This is a perfect example of what I call 'scary movie for kids'It is a movie for kids no more than 8 years old. After that age, kids have already figured out which are the real scary movies. Old and new.Wanna know how an 8 year old kid knows this is a kids movie ? Because the basic characters in the movie are 6 year old kids. Hahaha.Furthermore on this rather boring and uninspiring 2 hours of my life, I have very little to add, except the fact that someone out there is pouring water into the horror movie glass of red wine. All the time.Watching this film felt exactly like watching Bambi or any other kid's cartoons. It felt like I was watching a movie for kids. Boring, adds absolutely nothing to the genre, a Disneyland ride on fake horror films.Yes this is a fake horror film. Empty inside, terrible story and a see through ending. ('creepy' is the moon to the creators)Great Spoilers coming your way :The Conjuring 3 will feature 2 year old kids having a go in their diapers and the nanny will save them from the evil that makes them go in their diapers. Conjuring 4 will be the same but this time the 2 year old kids will be pissing in the diapers and the mother of the nanny will save them from the haunted house.Maybe then we will start doing hand paintings and get a gold star from the movie theater owner.Retitled : MAMA & PAPA SCARY MOVIE 2 (The Great Beyawn)",2,7,14,22 June 2016
Gone Girl," Now I'm never getting married. Ever.
","I really like this movie although I do understand why all the people hated it. That's because of the huge plot holes and too many mistakes included. I get it. It's not hard to read all the goofs and plot holes in the movie's description on IMDb.I didn't expect it to have a Sherlock Holmes facts and detail pinpoint accuracy but all the blunders were fading away one at a time because of the very good acting. It's like the director had already identified these errors but kept going because he wanted to tell this rather unusual and gruesome story. It just had to be made one way or the other.It's not a bad film at all. I wouldn't call it entertaining either, very hard to be entertained by a dark, psychotic and violent movie such as this. By violent I mean psysical and psychological violence. And I think the pcychological violence was way over the top with this one. Which is a hard thing to do these days. But the director had a lot of help from the actress who played the wife and Ben Affleck. Ben could have done a much better job but in the end he plays out his character perfectly.I wouldn't recommend you go see it with your soon to be your wife girlfriend. If you do watch this with your girlfriend, listen carefully to what she says about this movie after it's done. If she loved it, maybe you ought to rethink a couple of things about her. Second thoughts never hurt anybody. Ha Ha Ha.Jesus Christ with all the people not liking this movie because of the plot holes. It's a psychological thriller not a CSI episode.

OK, the CGI ghost is on screen 5. More CGI ghost on my screen 6. Very boring stuff 7. Plot holes and horrible continuity 8. The ending scene forces the viewer to empathize with a computer image 9. Ending credits.....This movie makes me think that the first part was successful by mistake. And you have a terrible half movie and an even more terrible ending to prove this point.Horror movies entairtained the viewers in the past. But now it's all about cheating the viewer intentionally. And that is wrong. Now you get great movie posters and great openings. Then all you get is computer ghosts and crap endings. And that is supposed to qualify as a horror film ?

","No Stephen, we don't want your autograph either buddy. Not when the ending is a cartoon mess of CGI and a red balloon mate. Maybe in 27 years they will remake the remake of the remake's book to film adaptation in full CGI. Is this movie about kids exploring their homosexuality and a cartoon clown that goes BOO continuously for 2 movies in a row ? Really ?Jump scares, a clown that does nothing but scare kids, very cartoony and funny CGI monsters and have you ever watched the movie TERRIFIER ? Its a movie about a clown killing people. Check it out Stephen. Take your old musty closet full of old boring stories throw it out of the window and start over man. Or wait for the Saturday morning cartoon version of IT Chapter 3. Pennywise vs The teenage mutant ninja turtles.CGI scary faces. Really ? In the year 2019 people still pay to see that ? I felt absolutely nothing for the group of kids and later adults, looks like the actors were picked out of a hat no connection whatsoever between them no chemistry no nothing. Just a bunch of random people reading lines from a book to each other. Any more stiffer than that and their back ends would need CGI too.I thought Stephen King was super outdated. I thought Stephen King movies had great acting and terrible CGI. Not the other way around.Maybe sell the rights to Disney and have Luke Skywalker do a lightsaber battle with Pennywise and a bunch of Jedi turtles in the movie to sell toys at Walmart.

Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," What a bunch of bull-crap
","One of the toughest films to review, because there is no film to review.Simply put, this is the actual representation of Michael Keaton hammering the last nail on his coffin and probably saying goodbye to everyone without a bang.Keaton actually attempts suicide in the last scene of the film, which is actually what he does choosing to do this film.The entire movie is shot in one take. Yes folks, in one camera shot, which is actually a very boring and confusing technique dropped and never used again by directors a long time ago. The entire movie feels like you're riding on a very slow and boring coaster ride.I can't believe Keaton tries to take other actors down the drain with him, that is very selfish of him.Somebody shoot the director in the face so he won't make another film.Why this film is being advertised all over the place is beyond my understanding. Extremely boring, shows nothing, it's about nothing, a very big nothing.Keep destroying yourself Mr. Keaton but remember that your Batman role also goes down the drain with you. Leaving us to think that your Batman act was saved by the director and not you.What a terrible film and career. Scrap this, I'm watching Multiplicity and Dream Team again so I can get a laugh.",2,16,34,1 February 2015
The Conjuring," Citizen's Arrest goes Citizen's Exorcism
","Truth be told, I was jump scared 3 times in the film, but only because there was a lot of silence and then BLAM!! Works great for an audio book tape.I would call it a successful movie mush-up, which includes exorcisms, homicidal clown dolls, haunted houses, witches, a pinch of Amittyvile Horror and a paranormal research guy who becomes a priest on the spot for the gravy.I give it a 5, because it doesn't really introduce anything new to the table. It does have 2 great leading actors which make up for the lack of originality and the fact that the film fails to answer what happens with the haunted Chucky doll (that's crap).Bottom line, I really feel bad for that guy who had to deal with about 20 women in the film, all at the same time, alive and dead. Fairly tough.I see a sequel/prequel on the horizon with lots of crappy cgi ghosts and mid-budget actors.",5,0,1,22 September 2013
Prometheus," New Kind Of Prequels
","So we take a series of movies that are really famous and do 3,4 prequels instead of giving the fans what they want. You have to guess what the hell happens in the entire movie or watch it 300 times over to spot the meanings of every scene. Since we are all not under Ridleys payroll, another 3,4 Prometheus movies will rise just to comprehend what on earth happens to the entire crappy prequel series.I can't believe the entire Alien Saga & Xenomorphs story is based on an old man's wish to live forever collided with sexual encounters of the 3rd kind. It sounds like a Giger concept only it's not and that's what spoils the whole thing. I do not care if Giger was brought in, the Alien Squids look ridiculous.Last but not worst, it's stupid to do a film about another film but not exactly. The Charlize Theron addition saves the day which is rather too far from what I call a director's vision of a movie.Mr. Riddley should do a Predator prequel without the Predators...see how that turns out for the fans....",1,5,8,22 September 2012
The Wolverine," Fallling Asllleep Again....
","I fell asleep half way through the movie, only to wake up and watch it again, just to realize I fell asleep for the second time.Another Marvel character that goes Disney on us on the silver screen.The only fascinating thing here is that you fall asleep watching Logan on the screen fall asleep all the time.They keep hiring gay-like types of actors to play Conan, Wolverine etc etc...this doesn't really work for me.They keep making movies for the fast dollar, movies which the fans will forget in 6 weeks and never look back on them as something important that made a difference in any way.Classic characters should be granted a classic movie and not a stack of 'origin' flicks, leaving the fans to judge the cgi technology by the year and completely forget the character's nature or acting talents.This is a very sad, boring film. Qualifies for the entire boring X-Men movie saga for the kids.OK We saw X-Men in their diapers, Logan sleeping...Get on with it !! And stop computerizing Wolverine's claws, they look stupid !!

Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," They made it a Harry Potter episode. Hahahaha
","Oh My God !You see the opening credits, you have a great first 30 minutes. And then comes the unmasking of the villain. The magic moment of Disney. The horrible apocalypse of the strange bad guy we waited for the entire movie.It's a Sith, it's a plane. No, it's a bad guy from Harry Potter. The worst bad guy unmasking in the history of the bad guy unmasking. Ever.Who would have thought the Sith lord with the strange dark voice looks like a 15 year old geek rushed out from his parents basement ? He looks like he would be wearing a Nintendo t-shirt, not be a Sith Lord. Bouahahahahaha what a joke.Oh yes, the CGI super big bad guy was the cherry on top. After watching this, I came to the conclusion that this is a movie for kids. Just kids. Probably up to 15 years old at the most. The rest of the adult audience is just completely bored by now and doesn't want or need to see the movie ending.Disney's done it again. They mickey moused Star Wars and there's nothing you can do about it at all.I should have watched a Batman cartoon. Waste of time.",3,53,69,18 January 2016

","Oh dear,This movie was supposed to be good and it was actually good until the CGI and Samuel L. Jackson speech problem character, kicked in.It's supposed to be a good movie and Samuel L. Jackson throws his worst performance ever ? That's just ridiculous.So many factors start to bring down this film after about 30 minutes, it has a Jackie Chan meets The Avengers kinda twist to it. It's just unwatchable from the middle towards the end. Couldn't finish the movie without yawning a couple of times.The only serious and good idea in the film was the Camelot lineup, but they did everything they could to completely destroy it.The category of this film is just a bit above Spy Kids.What a waste of Colin Firth's awesome talent.Could have been so much better.",5,2,7,18 May 2015
The Cabin in the Woods," Freaks, Monsters, Ghosts and Weed !!!
","I love this movie call me a retard but I loved it and i could watch it a couple of times more with friends. I love all the different kind of monsters and the way they are all presented each in it's own cage, it reminds me a bit of the Thirteen Ghosts movie.To begin with I found it a bit cliché with the college kids going to the woods and the rest as usual but the movie has a really nice twist at the end even though the movie shows you the entire plot theme right from the beginning.Thank god someone made this film I really enjoyed the monsters breaking out of their prison and eating every person in the movie hahahaha....nice one.I give it 9 skulls on the Mike Enslin scale because it combines the paranormal and the classic horror. And because I've seen so many crap horror/zombie movies lately and this one has actually something different to offer.I want to see sequels of this movie and fast too !!",9,0,3,9 October 2012
