The Sound of Music," I love this movie!
","One of everybody's favorites of all time, the Sound of Music is also one of my favorites. Let's put it this way, I can sing all the songs almost by heart, I have the sheet music and love to sing and play it.  There is so much of positiveness in that movie, that I have watched a million times and can watch it another million. Favorite Scenes: The beginning scene up on the mountains.  That is perhaps one of the most famous scenes of movie history. I love the idea of making dresses out of curtains. Favorite Quotes: Maria:' Where the Lord closes a door, somewhere He opens a window.' Maria:' When I feeling sad,  I simply remember my favorite things and then I won't feel so bad...' I love,  love,  and love this movie!",10,4,12,20 January 2001
Erin Brockovich," Julia Roberts is very good about picking her projects.
","This is a very captivating story about a woman who finds her mission in life. 'Erin Brockovich,' Julia Roberts (Sleeping with the Enemy)  begins to unveil a coverup of high water pollution levels that are affecting the lives of almost an entire community. The people she contacted all had several severe illnesses from cesium in ground water. PG&E had been discharging chromium 6 into water in holding ponds that they knew were leaking. The story has mystery and everybody loves movies where the little guy wins. This is one of those stories like Norma Rae and Silkwood. Julia Roberts is great as she goes around in those crazy 'trampy' outfits that only a few people like. Attorney  'Ed Masry'  Albert Finney (The Entertainer, Loophole) has to put up with a lot of curse words (which I really dislike) and a few punches on the verbal abuse side by Erin. But it all ends well, and they since this is based in a true story it makes the movie all more special. I have said in other comments that Julia is very good about picking her projects.Favorite Quote: Ed: 'What makes you think that you can just walk in there and find what we need.' Erin:' They are called boobs, Ed.' Favorite Scenes: Erin Brockovich-Ellis playing a waitress.",6,2,5,18 September 2000
As Good as It Gets," This almost all Oscar winner cast gives such a great performance that it makes it almost impossible not to love this movie in its entirety!
","Directed by Oscar nominee James L. Brooks, the story written by Mark Andrus brings up not only very interesting characters but also very interesting issues.  I have the video and enjoy watching it. The CD is great with music of Nat King Cole, Shawn Colkin. Outstanding acting by Helen Hunt (Mad About You, Twister) who won an Oscar for this role where she plays Carol Connelly, a single mother, working as waitress in Manhattan, New York. A single parent trying to cope with her work and paying medical bills for son Spencer Connelly, played by  Jesse James (Message in a Bottle, The Gingerbread Men, Gods and Monsters). Jack Nicholson (A Few Good Men, Easy Rider, Witches of Eastwick)  is Melvin Udall who is an obsessive compulsive.  Nicholson also won an Oscar for his part. His obsessive compulsiveness has taken over his life and he is not able to live a normal life.  Melvin Udall  has tons of soap all organized in his medicine cabinet.  He uses a bar of soap once and then throws it out. He will not step on a crack on the side walk but skips to the next block of concrete. When he goes to the restaurant he brings his own plastic fork, knife and spoon in a plastic bag. Udall uses plastic gloves to hold the dog and has all his office supply stacked and all color coordinated in his home/office. He eats at the same restaurant, sits at the same table, if someone is seating at his table he insults them to make them leave so that he has his table back, wants the same waiter Carol to wait on him, and takes forever to take a shower. He closes his door several times and counts how many times he has done it. As a writer who works at home I do understand Mr. Udall really well. Writers think somewhat like this: we like to be alone with ourselves in order to think. We have to go inside ourselves to produce good work. It is a very isolated world. We do not like to be bothered unless we are bored, or tired, in which case we want to communicate with the outside world for a brief period of time, then after one hour or so we want to go back inside ourselves again and be left alone. This is somehow like Melvin thinks. People think that he has nothing to do and they keep knocking at his door and he gets really aggravated about that.  He is my favorite character in this movie, not to diminish the other ones. He is just so full on nuances that make him very entertaining. Helen's role is very, very, good and she did a really good job with it. Greg Kinnear (Sabrina) is Simon Bishop, the artist who is Udall's next door neighbor who finally has Melvin turning into a little more normal human being and he is there to teach him many life lessons.  The supporting actors are great,  you have Oscar winner Cuba Gooding Jr. (Jerry Maguire) playing Frank Sachs, Simon's agent.My favorite scenes: elementary school kids all in uniform screaming: 'Wait! Melvin,  wait'! Greg Kinnear imitating Melvin. Melvin and Caroll going to eat fresh rolls in the wee hours of the morning. When Melvin realizes that the dog is also skipping cracks on the sidewalk.My favorite quote: 'I am drowning  here and you are describing the water.' This is a nice story telling movie. I recommend it!",9,57,88,21 May 1999
Shakespeare in Love," This movie is one for the movie-buff collection!
","Mere words cannot express the beauty of this movie. One has to see it in order to begin to grasp the majesty, the poetry of the movie. Listening to 'Viola' Gwyneth Paltrow (Flesh and Bone) reading poems is wonderful. She is brilliant in the part. She deserved the Oscar she won a million times. She is a gorgeous young woman and a great actress. I first rented the tape to check it out because I don't have the patience to watch those endless movies more than once.  I will not say which movie I made me feel that way.  I don't have the patience, or could it be patient?!? Many times a movie gets many Oscars but becomes a sleepy movie in my movie collection or a sleepy rental. But this movie is one for the movie-buff collection!  There is much to be digested after one watches it many times.Viola and Will made a lovely pair. Too bad there is never a happy ending for Romeo and Juliet movies, it would be nice if at least one had a happy ending. The script is brilliant,  composed of interwoven stories, the rhythm of the poetry, the photography, the actors acting in two levels: as actors in the play 'Romeo and Juliet' and as the characters in the movie. It is just outstanding. This is a rare gem of a movie. Favorite scenes: Will running after Viola in the street and finding out that the he is a she. The love scenes are beautifully done, the nurse and her little fan sitting outside the bedroom and making noise with her rocking chair. Any time Viola reads poetry was lovely.  Gwyneth makes reading poetry look easy, but it is not easy. Her sense of timing and her British accent are impeccable. Favorite Quotes: Lord Wessex: 'I have spoken to your father.'  Viola: 'I speak to him every day, sir.'   [Whispering at Viola's bedroom door] Nurse: 'Madame, the house is stirring. It is a new day.'  Viola: 'It is a new WORLD.'",10,1,2,13 December 1999
Dead Poets Society," Neat movie that shows much unfairness.
","Peter Weir (The Truman Show, Green Card, Witness) has done many good movies, and I always look forward to seeing his latest work. 'John Keating'  Robin Williams (What Dreams May Come) inspires his students toward free thinking and poetry. One the students had a father who did not have a clue about understanding his son's emotional needs causes the kid to commit suicide. Not taking responsibility for his own actions, the father incites the school head master to get rid of the professor. That was the sad part to me because in other boarding school movies such as: Circle of Friends, Scent of a Woman (at least partially a boarding school movie) the good wins, while in the Dead Poets the teacher gets fired. I did not like that unfair side of it. The kids do make a statement against the firing but primarily the bad guys win, at least that is my perception. The teacher wanted to inspire the students,  not the stuffy headmaster, and in that he succeeded.I liked the fact that in this movie we have boys interested in poetry and not girls, which breaks some stereotypes. I enjoyed the movie. The cinematography is pretty. Ethan Hawke was a cute young adult when this movie was made. Favorite Scenes: The kids meeting at night in their secret place. The boys memorizing poetry on their own. John Keating, stepping on the desk: 'We must look at things in a different perspective.' Favorite Quotes:  'Four disciplines: Brilliance, honor, discipline, excellence.'  Professor John Keating: 'Seize the day';  'Words and ideas can change the world.'; 'Strive to find your voice'; 'We are not laughing at you.  We are laughing near you.' I think that Julliard graduate Robin Williams has proven to be one great and versatile actor, and no small wonder he is an Oscar winner. He has played many parts that are completely outside of the scope of his funny self.",7,0,1,7 March 2000
Lost in Translation," That is Cultural Shock!
","Sofia Coppola (`The Virgin Suicide') wrote and directed this movie. I watched and had a few laughs. I fail to see the movie as a comedy per se though.  It is actually sad to be alone abroad with no one to talk to, and to not understanding the language, habits, etc. All those people have cultural shock. I think it should be called `Cultural Shock' instead of `Lost in Translation.' I do not speak nor understand Japanese so I cannot tell if is there were things lost in translation. I know that some languages take at least a full sentences if not more, to translate in one English word.  I know that is the case in the romance languages, like Portuguese, for instance. They are just wordier. That is why multilinguals talking to an English speaking person in a foreign language,  will insert words in English, because there are no equivalent words. I think that she conveyed the idea of a cultural shock really well, and turned such a simple feeling into an Oscar nominated movie. That is what good movies are all about, making the audience re-live their own lives. A brilliant concept and well deserved nomination for Sofia. She is the first woman director to be nominated for an Oscar, and wish she would win, but this year I have the feeling the statuette will go to the hobbits.I don't get it, I am not into that type of movie. Bill Murray ( `Ghostbusters II') `Bob Harris' has a great character and great job. The guy is seriously doing his job and I look at him and laugh. Well deserved Golden Globe, and could have 'thunk' that it was true that he fired his agent and his personal trainer committed suicide. That what I am saying, he is telling us something terrible sad, and we think he is joking. Scarlett Johansson (`Girl with a Pearl Earring') `Griet' is a very good actress with a very promising future before her. My favorite Scene:  Bob Harris getting on the elevator, he looks like King Kong. When he stops the can to say good bye to the only blond in town. My favorite quote: Bob: `What kind of restaurant makes you cook your own food?' I highly recommend this movie. That is exactly how you feel in a different culture. It took me back to so many places I ve been to.Great Idea! 10 out of 10.",10,0,1,9 February 2004
Forrest Gump," The script is brilliant!
","'Forrest Gump' Tom Hanks ( Sleepless in Seattle) is one of my favorite characters in all the movies that I have ever seen. That covers a lot of movies.  Every time I watch the movie,  I start talking like Forrest, Forrest Gump. His transparency, his sincerity, his naivete, his sense of commitment toward his friends is beyond what anyone could imagine. We watched the movie again when we were visiting relatives for Thanksgiving. Uncle Gene was cracking up. He is a WWII veteran.  He loved that line: 'I got a million dollars wound but so far I have not seen one cent of it!' After two days of talking like Forrest, Forrest Gump,  my husband looked at me and said: 'now you sound like Katharine Hepburn.' I think that one the reasons that I adore and understand Forrest is because he 'lived' through my years as a young adult. The script is brilliant! Clever, clever, clever! The movie touches everyone. The older folks, because they lived through it as adults; baby bloomers because they lived through it as young adults; even the kids in my neighborhood will scream: ' run,  Forrest, run.' Every time they see someone running. My favorite quote: Bubba Blue, Mykelti Williamson (Primary Colors) said: 'Anyway, like I was saying', shrimp is the fruit of the sea. You can barbecue it, boil it, broil it, bake it, sautee it. Dey's uh, shrimp-kabobs, shrimp creole, shrimp gumbo. Pan fried, deep fried, stir-fried. There's pineapple shrimp, lemon shrimp, coconut shrimp, pepper shrimp, shrimp soup, shrimp stew, shrimp salad, shrimp and potatoes, shrimp burger, shrimp sandwich. That- that's about it.'. My favorite scenes: Forrest showing his buttocks to the President. When he sees 'Jeannie' (Message in the Bottle) in Washington, D.C., they meet at the pool of the ellipse. They were again briefly like peas and carrots! Forrest sees 'Lieutenant Dan' Gary Senise (Apollo 13), he jumps into the ocean and his boat crashes! The little feather that flies at the beginning and end of movie. The music is great! This is one of the best movies ever made and that is all I have to say about that!",10,0,2,9 December 1999
Bridget Jones's Diary," The script is marvelous, Renée is terrific!
","This is a very refreshing movie. The script is marvelous. It is extremely well written and each line is throughly tough and extremely funny.  I usually prefer to see movies when they come out on video because there is no one talking behind me or some really tall boy who comes to sit in front of me, but I love Renée Zellweger (One True Thing, Jerry Maguire, A Price Above Rubies), who is not just a beautiful person on the outside, she is beautiful on the inside as well. She is also a very good actress. Renée  has done some heavy duty acting with actors of the caliber of Meryl Streep, William Hurt, Jim Cary, Tom Cruise, just to name a few. She is wonderful in the part of Brigitt Jones. She is Brigitt Jones!!!!!!!!!! I hope she gets a nomination for this.  They tricked me because I thought she was going to stay with 'Daniel Cleaver,' played by Hugh Grant (Notting Hill), but she does not. I am hoping they do a sequel, because I was reading that 'Bridget Jones : The Edge of Reason,' is even funnier than 'Bridget Jones's Diary.' I think this movie is one of the best movies I have seen lately. It is funny without being canned. I think that Colin Firth (Shakespeare in Love) ,  Hugh Grant, all did a great job, specially Renée Zellweger's accent. There is a possibility that she learned British English at  home because both of her parents were born in Europe, and Europeans tend to have a British accent not and American accent in English. She also spent sometime in England studying the part. Favorites Scenes: Opening Scenes when Bridget  is singing along with a record. The fire station scene. Sending e-mail to Daniel Cleaver without showing any facial expression. Picking up which undies to wear. The whole movie is hilarious. Favorite Line so far: ' everyone knows that dating in the thirties is not the happy lucky free-for-all it was when you were twenty-two...' I like Brigit's self-deprecating sense of humor.",10,0,0,15 April 2001
Notting Hill," I liked it!
","One of the best romantic comedies since 'You've got Mail.' I just got the tape and I keep watching it. The music is very inducing and intuitive which sticks to one's brain. She!  bla, bla, bla. Ups! I think I need the CD next. . . 'William Thacker' Hugh Grant (Sirens) is a such a down-to-earth,  polite, nice guy and nice looking too. Always wearing his casual everyday kind of clothes. Sort of 'The Gap, L.L.Bean, Eddie Bauer' commercial type of guy. The wilderness in the city, casual but sophisticated. Neat! Somewhat reminds me of my husband.  I think it is interesting that the part is for a man and not a woman. He is the one waiting for her, getting dumped, feeling left out, depressed, the entire family knows about it. This is a stereotypical female role. Hugh did a great job and received awards for his acting.The famous actress played by Julia Roberts (Something to Talk About, Sleeping with the Enemy) 'Anna Scott' is also down to earth trying so hard to just be herself. Julia is always so likable. I think I have the tape of every movie she has made. We love her smile around here. To be that famous is just not good. It is just not healthy. Now the roommate 'Spike' Rhys Ifans(Dancing at Lughnasa) is funny. At first I thought I couldn't stand this guy as a roommate. I still think their house is too messy, and because Thacker is so neat looking and Spike is weird I assumed that Spike was the one messing up everything.  But I crack up with 'Spike.' He is a lot of fun. Since when does yogurt taste like mayonnaise? It must be spoiled. Duh! Thacker just has the ideal family, although they are a little bit dysfunctional. There is unity in that family. I recommend the movie. I would not watch this movie trying to let the little slips in the actor's personal lives influence my judgment. Just think about their acting and about how well they are playing that particular role. That is what I try to do with everyone in the business. Everything else is history or just 'story.' My favorite scenes: Thacker walking down that street and the street turns into every season: Summer, Fall, Winter, Spring  meaning all this time without Anna. It is a very nice scene.If I lived close to that street my house would be 'in the spring.' I liked Hugh Grants performance. Spike in front of the blue-door posing for the press. Spike dancing with his fiancé.My favorite Quotes: Anna Scott': Probably better not tell him about this!' [the kiss] William Thacker: 'Right. I may tell myself sometime but I will not believe.' Thacker sister-in-law: ' Don't take it personally. The more I think about things the more I see no rhyme or reasons in life. Some thing's workout and some others don't.  But some of us get lucky and some of us . . . ' Watch It!",10,0,1,17 February 2000
Cold Mountain," No doubt, a very good movie.
","Anthony Minghella, who directed `Truly, Madly Deeply' a movie I loved, wrote the screenplay, directed, did other things this jam of a movie. The movie is the life journey of Inman, played by the extremely young looking and talented, Judy Law (`The Talented Mr.Ripley', movie also directed by Minguella; and among others `Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil'). Inman's life journey is told in a fashion of a person returning home, in a sense like we all are, in a journey back to the unknown, and to the woman he loves. His life's journey is full of struggles and temptations, but more than anything a very humbly experience. He becomes a deserter and is very much persecuted because of it. Oscar winner Nicole Kidman (The Hours) is absolutely beautiful in the movie, and plays a very pampered pastor's kid. Now comes Renee Zellweger as `Ruby Thewes' (`One True Thing,' `Bridget Jones Diary' and the much anticipated, `Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason.' She is an actress I absolutely adore, with that super fast southern accent, and full of bravery very upfront, making everyone laugh. Just when you think things are pretty bad.  Watching Renee work is worth the ticket price. I have watched at least fifty percent of her work, if not more. She is a very good actress. I can say every line of `One True Thing,' Yes... I can talk like Bridget.'perfect' and know the lines as well.  Renee has a sense of self worth, innocence, a strong sense of morals, even moved to NY, not to be polluted by Hollywood, that makes her a very, very  special  She DESERVES Golden Globes,  and Oscar and whatever other statuettes they are handing out this year. So please, members of whatever vote for RENEE!!!!!!! Please! I liked the other characters especially, the N.Y.U. graduate Phillip Seymour Hoffman `Veasey', who played in `Twister' plus 37 more movies. He is always playing those disturbed people. I look at him now and start laughing. Just like when I look at Jack Nicholson (`Something's Gotta Give,' `As Good as it Gets') I just crack up! I view this movie as the Inman's life journey of, regardless of where he is heading. It is his complete journey. Along with `Glory,' ` The Love Letter' (a movie worth looking for, with Campbell Scott and Jennifer Jason Leigh) are my favorite movies about the Civil War. Speaking about a very American topic, Civil War, our Civil war, explain going to Romania. I find no reason for such fiasco, besides cheaper labor, than if made in the U.S., why sent those people all the way to Romania???????  when there are so many actors that could work in right here in our back yard... and don't feel like going all the way to Hollywood to get started.  For that I find no excuse. Sorry... but the money should have stayed right here with us. We are in wartime, Hello!!!!  This irritates me. But I must say the photography is beautiful, and so is the music. I recommend the movie, but I am not that much into drama. There are enough funny parts. My favorite and most funny lines came from Ruby and Veasey. Ruby: `They call this war a cloud over the land. But they made the weather and then they stand in the rain and say 'Sh** its raining.' No doubt, a very good movie.",9,1,1,21 January 2004
Cold Mountain," Nice!

The movie is the life journey of Inman returning home to the woman he loves, played by the extremely young looking and talented, Judy Law (The Talented Mr. Ripley, Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil). I paralleled his return to `Ada' played by Nicole Kidman (The Hours, The Others ) as most people's life.  Inman's life journey is told in a fashion of a person returning home, in a sense like we all are, in a journey back to the unknown, and to the woman he loves.

The Shining," To my recollection I was never so scared after watching a movie than I was after watching The Shining.
","I believe that this is my favorite movie directed by the late Stanley Kubrick.  Apparently  Stephen King was not happy about what Kubrick had done with the movie because there was a second movie done, by King. I did not have the chance to watch the second one. 	To my recollection I was never so scared after watching a movie than I was after watching The Shining.  It scared me to death then and it still has the same effect on me now. Every time I watched a scaring movie, my mother would just say: 'this is just a movie!'  I kept that in mind, but when 'Danny Torrance ' Danny Lloyd (Will: The Autobiography of G. Gordon Liddy) was riding his tricycle, and I saw the pattern of the carpet, I knew that he was on the third floor where he was not supposed to go. I knew the two girls would appear,  that was shivering. Those movies about reincarnation, madness, pictures on the wall from decades ago with the same faces of people that are now alive, make my hands cold. I get so frightened!!! 	I tend to love comedy, and horror movies are very far from that, but this movie is a classic. It is not gory and has the psychological impact in a very Hitchcock style, where the audience knows what is going to happen before the character does.  It makes a movie very eerie, because somehow, although we know it is a movie, we all scream trying to give notice to the character that he or she is in real danger. I recommend this movie because it is a horror movie indeed. That maze where  'Jack Torrance' Jack Nicholson (As Good as it Gets) finally dies, is frightening.  Danny was so good figuring out how to get back. Scary!!!!  The music by Béla Bartók,  Hector Berlioz,  György Ligeti, that modernism and dissonance gives the movie even more realism. 	My favorite scenes: When they are driving up to the hotel. Danny meeting 'Dick Hallorann'  Scatman Crothers(Roots) and they both have the shining. Plainly speaking just telepathy!  When Dick comes to rescue 'Wendy Torrance' Shelley Duvall (The Portrait of a Lady). 	Most memorable scene: When Jack is getting to the bathroom door and goes: 'Here is Johnny.' 	Favorite quotes: Mr. Halloran: 'Some places are like people: some shine and some don't.'  Danny: 'Redrum! Redrum! Redrum!'  Jack typing 'All work and no play make Jack a dull boy...'",8,0,0,13 January 2000
American Beauty," The movie mirrors society.
","Lester Burnham, Kevin Spacey (The Usual Suspects, Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil) and Carolyn Burnham, Annette Bening (The American President) have a terrible relationship, a marriage 'made in hell.'  As a result the family is completely dysfunctional. All the characters have something weird about them. The society they live in is imperfect, they live in a very imperfect world and the imaginative use of all the neuroses make it a great and suspenseful script, an Oscar winner. The actors were nominated for and Spacey won an Oscar.  American Beauty also won  Best Director,  Best Picture, and Best Cinematography Oscars. I say it deserved them. It mirrors society extremely well. Carolyn Burnham represents the materialistic society we live in. She puts more value into her couch than she does to her husband.   I found it interesting that all the furniture and scenes carry a lot of minimalism and simplicity.  There is in contrast much going on with the characters.  An instant classic, Sam Mendes' American Beauty,   to me parallels Robert Redford's Ordinary People.  Outside everything is beautiful and perfect but inside it is viciously ugly,  full of lust and sin. That simplicity and the primary colors such a the red door, made me pay closer attention to the dialogues.  I found the young adult neighbor weird as far as been a peeping Tom, but had a unique sense of  beauty. I recommend this movie!Favorite Scenes: the blowing autumn leaves, the red petals, the contrasting colors.  The movie is a feast for the eyes. Well deserved best cinematography. Favorite Quote: Carolyn Burnham: 'This is a four thousand dollar sofa upholstered in Italian silk. It is not just a couch.'  Lester Burnham:' IT'S JUST A COUCH!'",10,0,0,25 July 2000
The Usual Suspects," Fascinating Movie!
","I loved this movie. The plot is fascinating. Kevin Spacey (The midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil) won an Oscar for his performance of 'Verbal Kint', which is a great part and a very intriguing one. I did not expect the end and I have sent for the movie because it is a great movie. I trust the IMDB users ratings - They are right on the nose!  I got to a point now that before renting or buying any movie I have a look at the average vote for the movie at IMDB. This movie has good performances, great script, it keeps you wondering throughout the whole movie. My favorite quote:  Verbal Kint: 'The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist.' Verbal Kint: Keaton once said, 'I don't believe in God, but I'm afraid of him. Well I believe in God, and the only thing that scares me is Keyser Soze.' My favorite scenes: When the police officer screams down the street: Look out for that crippled man. There is no crippled man? What crippled man? This is a 10 movie. It is a must see!!! Brilliant!!!",10,0,1,31 January 2000
Saving Private Ryan," I felt that in a sense, that we are all Private Ryan because those soldiers fought for our freedom!
","Normally I do not like war movies, but I watched Saving Private Ryan and loved it! It deserves to be among  the top 250 movies. The story is loosely based on a true story of The Sullivan Brothers. There were five brothers that were all put aboard a ship, the ship sunk and they all died in the same day. Imagine how devastating that must have been to that family. Because of the Sullivan Brothers there has been a law passed that siblings cannot serve on the same vessel. 	My father -in-law was a pilot and the only son during the Korean war.  He was a volunteer! His plane crashed on U.S. soil. My husband is the soul survivor and he was then seven months old. My mother-in -law heard the news on the radio. Imagine how devastating that must have been. My husband makes miniature model airplanes.  We have quite a collection of those cute little planes. Every airplane is well researched as my husband goes to National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C.  He is very interested in the Pacific Theater - a war buff!  He also corresponds with several veterans. It is really adorable. He loves war movies.  I tend to fall asleep watching them, unfortunately,  but I try to stay awake and understand. We have a good collection of famous war movies, educational videos etc. I purchased Saving Private Ryan along with a very romantic movie, because I thought: I am sure that I will doze off! But no! I watched the entire thing and loved it! 	Let me tell you why I loved it: (1) There is no unnecessary use of curse words. They are used properly there are no exaggerations! I watched  'Full Metal Jacket,'  I know that those guys curse but every word in that movie is 'F word!' I hated it. (2) Then the painted faces. They scare me to death! I know it is a form of camouflage but I still get scared. That is what scared me the most in 'Apocalypse Now'  and 'Platoon.' (3) I understood the story in this movie and it is moving. It is nice story telling. Going back in time. Private Ryan being such a nice person makes the movie even better!  I liked two war movies so far,  this one and 'A Midnight Clear.' I must understand the point. Just plain violence does not cut it! People say but that is how war is. Well, I want to be wise about what is good, and innocent about what is evil.  I can only take so much. I did not have to go to war. It is just a movie. I do not want to be traumatized all at once in one movie!  (4) I don't like the over emphasis on the use of drugs in movies like 'Platoon'either. There is nothing like that in Saving Private Ryan. That is why I love it! 	My favorite scene: at the end of the movie cemetery, the camera pans and there are all those white crosses:  I felt that we are all Private Ryan because those soldiers fought for our freedom. Most of us enjoy such freedom undeservingly. But they died for us all.  My favorite quotes: ' All four were in the same company, but after we split them  after the Sullivan brothers died on the Juno.' Ryan: ' Tell her that when you found me, I was here and I was with the only brothers that I have left'.",10,0,0,19 August 1999
The Piano," The acting is great!
","The script is vague and rambles from place to place. When you finish watching it, you wonder what was the message was. Holly Hunter (Home for the Holidays) won an Oscar for her part, which she played beautifully, specially considering that she played the piano herself.  Oscar winner, Anna Paquin (Fly Away Home )  lights up the screen with her innocence and beauty. She loves that butterfly wing! The acting is good.  The photography is great! The sex scenes were too graphic for me and my household. But it is over all interesting, but I was unable to discern what the core issue was in the movie. After watching this movie the scenes really stuck to my head, I just cannot forget the graphic scenes. I guess they are traumatic scenes!",5,3,8,5 May 1999
The Insider," The movie is excellent.
","Eric Roth (The Horse Whisperer, Suspect) has written great scripts. The Insider kept me watching, and grabbed my attention. Very well written and with a great cast 'Lowell Bergman' Al Pacino (The Godfather, Looking for Richard) is a great character. I remember something about the incident. Russell Crowe (Gladiator, Proof of Life) is a very good actor. The man he plays  'Jeffrey Wigand ' is very smart, has a lot of knowledge about the cigarette industry, and who was willing to come forward to tell that the cigarette industry was in privy that cigarettes are addicting. Well, not to put the character down, but I believe that everybody knows that.  The entire world knows that... Why don't they do something about it, you've guessed it money!  Why they decide to destroy the life of  Wigand is beyond me because the whole world knows to be true what he was going to say anyway. But they destroyed him, and the movie is about how he was followed, stalked, terrorized. and so on. When I was young I also believed in changing the status quo, but after having gone through severe trials because I am outspoken I have learned to keep my mouth shut. Is it good, that I have learned that? Not sure! But for some reason sometimes even describing the obvious in the world is an  impossible thing to do. Why? I don't know. This is an excellent movie which I recommend. My favorite scene: Is a conversation where Lowell Bergman states: 'You'd better look into it, because I'm getting two things: pissed off and curious.' Favorite Quotes: Jeffrey Wigand: 'I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I? I could be anything. Right? Anything worth putting on between commercials.' Lowell Bergman: 'To a network, probably, we're all  commodities. To me? You are not a commodity. What you are  is important.' I recommend this movie. It is excellent.",7,0,0,3 January 2001
Quiz Show," I will never look at a quiz show with the same eyes I had before I saw this movie.
","Directed by  Robert Redford who was nominated for an Oscar. Redford in my opinion is great director. He has the eye for it! Brilliant writing by Paul Attanasio, who was nominated for Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium. This is a true story, which makes this movie even more interesting.John Turturro (The Big Lebowski) is just outstanding in the part of Herbie Stempel, who has been winning the Geritol Quiz Show, and really gets addicted to the attention. The favored contestants had the answers before hand, but Herbie is asked to lose to a successor Ralph Fiennes (The English Patient, Schindler's List) Charles Van Doren. Van Doren is a lovable, well bred, educated, nice looking young man who teaches literature at Columbia University, and that infuriates Herbie, who hates him.Rob Morrow (Northern Exposure, Last Dance) plays Dick Goodwin who is an attorney with the Federal Government working for a Congressional subcommittee investigating the scheme in the late 1950s. Morrow and Van Doren are of Jewish background, and Goodwin likes Charles Van Doren and wants to protect him.  His wife Sandra Goodwin, Mira Sorvino (Jake's Women, Mighty Aphrodite), even tells him about over protecting Van Doren. After many lies and cover ups, there is a congressional hearing and everything is brought to light. All this with Redford master touch directing.Look who is acting in the role of one of the sponsors of the quiz show! It is the talented director and N.Y.U. Professor, Mr. Martin Scorcese. Scorcese was one of Oliver Stone's (Any Given Sunday) teachers at N.Y.U. He is also excellent at that as well.Favorite Quotes: Charles Van Doren: 'I flown too high on borrowed wings.' A Senator:' An adult should simply not be commended for telling the truth.' Favorite Scenes: The Van Doren family picnic with everybody quoting poetry, Van Doren father and son,  sharing a piece of chocolate cake and a glass of milk and their dialogue, Van Doren Jr. purposefully losing the contest.The music is great as well.  All in all,  this is a great movie. I highly recommend it. I will never look at a quiz show with the same eyes I had before saw this movie. It changed my perspective.",9,4,10,30 May 1999
There's Something About Mary," This movie is bad! Really, really bad!
","I decided to watch this movie because Cameron Diaz was nominated for a Golden Globe Award. Despite the fact that Cameron is a fine young actress, I regret having wasted my time watching this movie.  The 'something' about Mary must be that; she attracts all those outlaws, who keep competing to see who is the worst idiot she has attracted. Cameron is a young doctor who does nothing related to medicine in the movie. I just did not get what is funny about this movie! Ben Stiller, who is normally a good actor, plays this loser.  In the beginning he wears this horrible wig pretending to be young and is not convincing at all. Since I did not watch Dumb and Dumber I am unable to cross reference. But my recommendation is stay away from this movie. It is awful! There is no script or point to this race of the out-laws that cute young doctor attracts. The writers seem of have simply tried to collect all the dumb gags associated with attraction to women and thrown them all together in this hodge podge script.What is suprising to me is that they found someone to pay for this film to be made.",1,10,22,14 February 1999
Life Is Beautiful," I fell in love with every detail of this movie!
","Roberto Benigni s speech and reaction at the Academy Awards made me laugh and cry at the same time. He was definitely one of the most animated and jolly persons that I had ever heard and seen in my life. I just got the video and the movie is just as precious as Robert himself!  The movie has movement, rhythm, it is a look the holocaust  from the eyes of a little boy, who's dad 'Guido Orefice' played by Roberto Benigni (Son of the Pink Panther, Pinocchio)  had the most wonderful perspective of life that I ever heard about .The role of dad 'Guido Orefice,' was  in reality based on that of Benigni's father himself,  which indicated that Roberto inherited his great and awesome humor. That is a precious gift. What a thankful heart! I absolutely loved the movie. There is that famous show business saying:' to make people cry is easy, but to make people laugh is hard.'  To, I would add if you will, to make people cry watching such a predicament is even harder. There absolutely nothing in the movie that I did not like. I fell in love with every detail. Normally when I buy a foreign film I like to get the original, especially those in Italian which is a language that I understand very well, but I ended up with the English version, even so no complaints, I really, truly enjoyed the movie. My favorite scenes:Guido Orefice on is bicycle, Guido Orefice, his wife and his son on his bicycle. The way he treated the woman he was in love with, always saying: 'Buon giorno, Principessa!'  Guido in front of the students in his undies!  All he did to charm 'Dora'  Nicoletta Braschi (Afirma Pereira; Pasolini, un delitto italiano) the love of his life, and also in real life,  Benigni's wife. My favorite quote: 'Serving but you are never a servant. Serving is an act practiced by the Supreme being himself. God serves man but He is not a servant.' Go get this movie and see one the best movies ever! It deserved all the awards and nominations it received.",10,1,3,5 September 2000
A Clockwork Orange," This is a very interesting movie.
","Malcolm McDowell (Mr. Magoo) 'Alex DeLarge' the young man,  supposed to be fifteen years old,  according to the book, speaking Nadsat as slang (Russified  English) is the key character in the movie.  He is the leader of a gang of four juvenile delinquents.  It appears that they are extremely bored. They committed heinous crimes.  He went to prison and decided to go though 'aversion therapy,' in order to get released earlier,  and after the therapy he  becomes excessively passive.  After being used by an anti-government group which caused him to try to commit suicide, and much criticism in the press he is restored back to what he was. Watching both processes is very interesting. The first time I watched this movie, is somewhat historical in our household.  My husband and I were vacationing abroad and we found ourselves with nothing to do on Saturday night than to go to a movie. My husband had already watched A Clockwork Orange.   Well, the censors in the country that will remain   nameless decided to add little black balls to covering the genitals and breasts of the naked women in the movie. Those little black balls kept jumping up and down during the 'Billy Boy' scene. The entire theater was laughing and we all got severely distracted.  We have a good laugh every time we remember those scenes and the jumping black balls!My favorite scenes: Alex and his sexy eye lashes in one eye only. Alex singing 'Singing in the Rain.' As I understand McDowell improvised that scene, Mr. Kubrick liked it so much that he had to go all over to get the license for the 'Singing in the Rain' to be part of the movie.  The Minister of the Interior hand feeding Alex after he has been cured (back to normal) with Alex milking the act for all the fun he can get out of it. My favorite quotes: Alex: ' Oh bliss! Bliss and heaven! Oh, it was gorgeousness and gorgeousity made flesh.' Minister: 'Goodness comes from within, goodness is choosing. When a man can not chose he ceases to be a man.' I love the music because it has two of my favorite composers: Ludwig van Beethoven and Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov.  This is a very interesting movie.",6,0,2,9 October 1999
A Beautiful Mind," The chance to see the mind of a schizophrenic! WOW!
","I could never have imagined how a person with schizophrenia views the world. I thought that they just heard voices, but I knew nothing about them seeing people.  I was actually very surprised when I realized that `John Nash' brilliantly played by Russell Crowe (Proof of Life, The Insider) has all those imaginary people inside his head.  I believed that the way he was cutting and pasting newspapers and magazines showed how confused his mind was.Last time Brian Grasier produced a movie about someone with a psychiatric disorder was ` As Good as it Gets', a movie that won two Oscars:  one for Jack Nicholson   `Melvin Udal',the obsessive compulsive writer.  The  second Oscar went to Helen Hunt 'Carol Conelly.' the woman that Melvin falls in love with. The movie got much praise from psychiatrists and it is  loved by many people. I love the movie. I have been watching it. It is a well done movie. As a parallel I am hoping that the movie at hand wins many Oscars. I am cheering for all who got nominated, specially Russell Crowe, because he is a very good artist and because I don't believe that the Academy has ever given two Oscars in a roll to a foreign born actor. I love the fact that `Alicia Nash's' played by Jennifer Connelly (Inventing the Abbotts) stayed by her husband's side until he was finally able to live with himself and society. My neighbors are getting the divorce!  This is a true story in every sense of the word.  `A Beautiful Mind' gave me more compassion than I already had for my neighbor who has the disorder. My neighbor used to send  letters to the entire homeowners association talking about how much Big Brother was giving him a hard time. It is amazing! He complained about the side effects of his medication. He has been hospitalized! It is very interesting that Ron Howard gave us the chance to see the mind of a schizophrenic. This movie has already done a tremendous service to society. I highly recommend this movie. It is incredibly well made!  A***** on my scale!",10,0,2,13 February 2002
When Harry Met Sally...," This is a Classic! One of the most romantic movies ever! It is hard to express in words what the movie expressed so well! Rob Reiner is the best male director of Chickie movies!
","From script to sound track this is a magnificent movie. It deals with: loss, male and female perspectives of: love, friendship, dating, being married, being married and then being single again, sex issues, anger, happiness, and jealousy.  The movie has great dialogue, a beautiful script,  the CD soundtracks do not get better than this with classic songs just to name a few: 'When and Where', 'It Had to be You', 'I Could Write a Book', 'Let's Call the Whole Thing Off'.  The later recorded by Harry Connick Jr.  who is just outstanding!The acting is invisible, Billy Crystal does a great job and is very believable as Harry (City Slickers).  The guy who believes that men and women cannot be friends, and sometimes he is annoying but yet charming in his own way. Meg Ryan (You've Got Mail) is cute as the perfectionist Sally who has all her tapes alphabetized, can order food better anybody else, and admits to being too rigid and structured.  Marie, Sally's best friend (Carrie Fisher)  is always looking for a man for everybody including herself with her very own personal box of names and addresses; Bruno Kirby (City Slickers)  as Jess,  thinks that a woman who has a great personality cannot be pretty, is Harry's best friend. Between their conversations of Jesse and Harry there is a whole spectrum of the male perspective about feelings in relationships.Director Rob Reiner is the best!  (Mixed Nuts, The American President). I will see any movie that Reiner has anything to do with it and buy the video because there is always something to chew on after I have watched the movie once.The script is clever!  Nora Ephron (Mixed Nuts, Sleepless in Seattle, You've got Mail) just knows how to write a good script! She is brilliant!My favorite scenes: When Marie is trying her wedding dress on and Sally says: 'That is beautiful!'  I feel that she is reflects in her own situation. Those scenes with all  those old couples telling how they met and fell in love are precious scenes. Harry getting mad because he was singing in front of Ira!  The jealousy of Sally when Emily (Tracy Reiner)  comes into the picture, she is Aunt Emily the pie maker. I don't know how many people realize that Tracy is Rob Reiner's daughter. The ending is precious when Harry sees couples around while he window shops alone New Year's Eve, and starts running to tell Sally how he really feels! That is a tearing scene. This is one of my favorites. I highly recommend this movie!",10,1,2,10 March 1999
Love Actually," Very uplifting movie.
","This is a delightful movie. As we walked out the of the theater my husband said:' Get the tape, get the DVD, whatever.' There are many aspects of this movie that mean a lot to me: (1)  The majority of the movie was filmed in England, a country that I have great memories of. It is true that there is a lot of love in airports. I was there just last Spring, and felt very loved when my friends waited for me at Heathrow with big smiled giving me hugs and kisses; (2)  I do live about 10 minutes from Dulles airport where one of the planes was hijacked from on September 11,  and the amount of security we had to go thru at Dulles gave me a strange feeling. Although such a crime against humanity started at the airport, the writer of the screenplay was inspired by the events and came up with such an uplifting movie;  (3)   I do speak Portuguese and I must congratulate Colin Firth (Circle of Friends, Bridget Jones Diary, and the much anticipated Bridget Jones, The Edge of reason). I watched him in an interview where he said that he does not speak Portuguese at all. I thought he was fluent. Perhaps his knowledge of Italian and French helped. It was flawless. It was such a pleasant surprise, to hear Portuguese. It is very hard to summarize this movie, because it has a lots of people and lots of stories. Just think of it  as a spoken musical, during the Spring and it is all about love.  It is impossible to write a summary about everyone without making people bored to tears, and have their eyes crossed and their mind wandering after the third sentence. After awhile it is ludicrous to read because your mind will wander if you try. This movie  is to be watched, and felt and not to be described. This movie is to be enjoyed, like love. The characters are all flirting, falling in love, falling out of love.  The movie is excellent.  We left the theater happy, enthusiastic about life. The cast is full of giants of the British Cinema. I  highly recommend it!",8,0,2,22 January 2004
The Shawshank Redemption," Very few things in life are better than meeting your best friend by the blue waters of the ocean.
","Tim Robbins (I.Q.) 'Andy Dufresne' accused and convicted of the murder of his wife, is sent a prison called Shawshank. Morgan Freeman (Driving Miss Daisy) 'Red' is also in prison and he can get things from the outside world. Because of that, they become best friends. This movie is full of hope.  It has such sweet moments in such a terrible place as a jail.  I have never watched a movie about a jail that is as positive as this one. It is the best movie on the subject. It has great dialogue, gives the audience the sense of constant cheering for Andy because he is so ingenious. The little glasses fit the character. Andy is brilliant indeed.  I applauded him for things that he did, which are also my favorite scenes: the idea of walking around the jail yard and the discharging of the powder that he made out of the jail wall, was just remarkable;  the big posters such as one of  Rita Hayworth later Rachel Welch,  on the wall;  the creation of the library;  the transfer of bank funds;  getting that hypocrite jail warden caught;  leaving clues for Red after he was paroled. Very few things in life are better than meeting your best friend by the blue waters of the ocean. I love the ending. This movie is part of our video library and I have watched it several times and I still get hyper about the stuff that Andy does. Favorite Quote: Red: 'Geology is the study of pressure and time that is all it really,  pressure and time.'",10,0,0,9 October 1999
Platoon," Platoon is a story about making choices and the terror of a war. Autobiographic, and very moving!
","I am a Quaker, meaning someone who does not believe in war. My view is that wars are a form of killing of the poor, the lower middle class,  people get killed because there were no other jobs available to them except to join the military. It is also a form of making money, selling armaments  and the struggle for power. I might be wrong in that! But that is my opinion.When this movie came out I was in law school and I was fighting my own war at school as law school is much similar to a military regime. I was a basket case!  This movie put terror in my head!  I was terrified.  I said that I would never watch a war movie again in my life!  But I have overruled that principle.  I felt that Chris, Charlie Sheen,  had made a mistake that he admits in his letters to his grandmother.  I kept asking myself why is this kid writing to the grandmother and not his mother. I have watched most of Stone's movies and had read most books written about him. I sense that this movie is autobiographic. Stone and his father could not see eye to eye on things, his parents got divorced when he was fifteen if I am not mistaken. He felt betrayed because he did not suspect that the divorce was coming and perhaps decided that he was alone in the world!  When Stone was at Yale he decided to volunteer when he did not have to!  Oh, God!  Bless his soul!  He believed innocently that he could serve his country. Viet Nam changed a naive innocent recruit who went to war, and allowed him to see the ambiguity of the war.  The platoon started fighting between itself and killing innocent civilians, because the two sergeants could not get along. This conflict of choice turns the young recruit into a man that we now know as one the best writers, directors,  producers of our days.  As Chris, Stone seems to have his own opinions about things, (Stone is also the only child and this is an only child syndrome), he comes up with projects that he feels are the right thing to do and does them alive or dead! Stone parallels Chris' choice to go to war in his own life. He is very independent. There is always a price to pay for being independent!  That is clear in Platoon.I could never come up with stuff that Stone does.  Still after having seen all that atrocity and although his movies are full of violence, he did not lose his faith and tenderness as one can see him in a cameo appearance  in his movie Salvador, right at the beginning of the movie Stone kisses a little boy. Stone has a worldwide view because he himself admits feeling like a foreigner,  his mother was a French Catholic woman and his father was Jewish. This movie is 'one of the best war movies ever made', and Oscar worthy movie to me.  As a woman, who is not a believer of war, the movie is about paying the price of our decisions. Chris as well as Oliver Stone did not have to volunteer to go to Viet Nam. They felt that they could make a difference as a young men going to war. Stone was wounded and earned a purple heart. The cast in this movie is superb as well as the music.This is my parallel perception of the story of Chris/Stone in the platoon .. . I would like to see this movie re-released to be able to watch  in its entirety without cuts.",10,1,1,10 March 1999
Mr. Holland's Opus," Richard Dreyfuss is good in all stages of the different seasons of the life of Mr. Holland.
","The writing of this movie by Patrick Sheane Duncan (Nick of Time), nominated for an Oscar and Golden Globe Awards, is one of the best stories that Hollywood ever put on the screen. The sensitivity and perception of the Director Stephen Herek (101 Dalmatians) adds a special touch to the story.Richard Dreyfuss (The Goodbye Girl, The Competition, The American President) was  nominated for an Oscar and Golden Globe for this role, which is my view one of his best performances. He is good in all stages of the different seasons of the life of Mr. Holland.  I seldom cry while watching a movie,  but when Mr. Holland enters the school auditorium with grey hair and the entire school is applauding when he retires, it makes me cry. I cry every time I watch it,  and I can also cry every time I bring it to mind. If I ever get a part where I have to cry all I have to do is to bring back that memory back!  That moment is a combination of my mother a music teacher and my dad aging. There is no greater love than to lay your life for another... When I graduated from college I wrote a letter thanking my parents for the rainy days they had to go to work,  and for all the sacrifices they made for me and left it on top of the dining room table so they could find when I was not around.  Needless to say that the entire family cried. That is what that scene means to me. I do not see Mr. Holland as a frustrated composer, he was just frustrated because he had other commitments that did not give him the time to compose. Glenne Headly did a great job playing Iris Holland. She has appeared in ER recently. Olympia Dukakis (Steel Magnolias) plays  Principal Jacobs. It is beautiful when close to her retirement she gives Mr. Holland a gift.  Jean Louisa Kell (The Day Lincoln Was Shot) is Rowena Morgan who steals the show because she sings beautifully. William H. Macy, (Fargo) plays Vice Principal Wolters who goes insane when he listens popular music coming from Mr. Holland's classroom. Poor Gertrude Lang,  Alicia Witt ('Cybill') is trying so hard to get the technique that she forgets about her feelings. I love when she finally gets to feel the piece and lets herself go.Then when she comes back as grown up is very touching. A music teacher having a deaf child is ironic. Mr. Holland  teaching the kids about Beethoven is marvelous!  I love when Cole (Anthony Natale (II)), comes back as an adult and participates in the celebration of his dad's retirement, and also because he himself is going to teach at the school for the deaf in Washington DC. This movie struck a cord with me because of the music and because of all the elements that were brought into movie and story. I would give it a10 + if I could. It is one of my favorite dramas! I am not much of a drama person, I prefer comedy, but this is a very special drama.",10,46,55,22 April 1999
The Sixth Sense," This is definitely a ten. Clever!
","Oscar nominee,  Haley Joel Osment (Murphy Brown, Mixed Nuts, Forrest Gump) who started at a young age and has been under the best directors in the industry such as: Nora Ephron, Robert Zemeckis, etc., plays 'Cole Sear.' Way to go Haley!  He is not only cute and adorable but all his interviews are great. His answers are impressive and wise.  Did 'Forrest Gump' Tom Hanks, teach you all those diplomatic answers? The movie is excellent. The cast if great. My favorite Bruce Willis part (Twelve Monkeys, Nobody's Fool) in a long time as 'Malcolm Crowe,'  the children's psychiatrist who has to deal with a boy who is paralyzed by fear because he lives in a world of ghosts and sees dead people. No mystery there! It is hard not to give away the plot. You must see the movie.I tend to stay away from movies that have too much violence, and made a vow with myself that I would not watch any movie that brought fear to my mind. The Sixth Sense did not. I have great respect for the voting process done by IMDb. The movie is 22 on the 250 list, so I had to see it. Actually I am going to get the tape. The makers of the movie kept giving away clues but people don't get them. It is an outstanding movie. I highly recommend it. This is definitely a ten. Clever!  If you are like me and don't like gory movies, this movie is not gory. There is absolutely nothing scary about it. It is just the best! My husband liked it so much that he finished watching it and rewound the tape and watched it again.  Amazing! Favorite Scenes: The boy seeking refuge in a church from the mean guys. Favorite quotes: Malcolm Crowe: 'How do you draw now?'  Cole Sear: 'Draw . ..  people smiling, dogs running, rainbows. They don't have meetings about rainbows.'",10,0,0,13 April 2000
The Truman Show," Finally a movie that makes us think
","When I was a young adult on the search for my true self, religion and God; I found myself reading all kinds of books such as: Demian, Sidarta, Brave New World, 1984, the works of Jean Paul Sartre and Simone de Bolvoir. The world of Truman Burbank certainly took me back to those days. I used to look at myself in the mirror and say out loud: 'I wonder if I am me? I wonder if everybody thinks the same shade of red when I say red? Why was I born? Why are my parents my parents? Why did God create the world? Will I get punished by God for thinking all these things?' This is a deep movie, bound to become an art film.  Jim Carey did such a superb job that it earned him a Golden Globe Award. This is definitely an Oscar contender. It made me think! What a suprise! Movies do not make me think very often. They are predictable to me now. Could it be age?When the lady comes on the bike with the basket, then the dog and then the yellow Volkswagen it reminded me of how repetitive life seems at times, when we think that nothing is going to change and we want changes. The Director was like God,  the creator,  although at times he was a mean guy, I think that all of us have questioned God and have been angry at him. Truman's world seemed so 'perfect', no messy hair, no trash. Just phony! Our world seems much like that, everything is a matter of perception.The audience that watched the Truman Show in the movie was a hedonistic audience of consumers who wanted to be entertained no matter what the cost to Truman, reminded me of the soaps, of the Paparazzi, of how we like to know about the celebrities, and ultimatly of how the product could be the death of someone such as Princess Diana, or Truman Burbank.Purchase the video and watch it many times and many other symbols will come to mind. Like Jim Carey stated while he received the Golden Globe that he would enjoy it down to the crunchy chewy part.",10,189,252,1 February 1999
The Matrix," The issue is whether or not there is a Messianic message beneath the surface?
","Some people believe that there is a Messianic message in this movie because of the fight between Matrix's campaign of domination in the 'real' world and 'Thomas A. Anderson / Neo,' Keanu Reeves (A Walk in the Clouds, Much Ado About Nothing) the man who is to save the world.  He joins warriors 'Morpheus ' Laurence Fishburne (Searching for Bobby Fischer),  and 'Trinity' Carrie Ann Moss (Lethal Tender)  in their warfare against the Matrix.Neo does die and comes back to life and at one point he believes that 'He is the One' to save the world. If that was the intent of the writer, the message is not clear as far as I am concerned. There are Messianic elements in many of the super-heros such as Superman, with his powerful vision, Batman who fights the evil and forces of darkness of Gotham City and I just think that Neo is another super-hero with some type of Â‘god like' characteristics. To characterize the movie as a Christian movie is really stretching it. There is an element of deception such as the woman in red, is she real or is she a deceiver?  There is deception  in Batman when all the enemies come wearing a camouflage such as Mr. Freeze, The Riddler,   etc. I believe that there is an element of deception or even mistaken identity, if you will, in many movies. I really enjoyed the movie for its special effects and so did the members of the Academy of Motion Pictures as the movie won an Oscar for Special Effects among many other Oscars. I am not much into science fiction but I bought the tape because it was recommended by a bunch of Christian friends. The movie is fine, but I found that the movies such as 'The Sixth Sense' also have a religious side to them as the boy seeks peace and shelter in a church. There is definitely a struggle between good and evil, but everyone is dead already.  In 'The Sixth Sense' nobody gets that there is no big mystery about the movie except that they are all dead and are talking. Does the dead talk? The Bible indicates that they do. Look at Lazarus. And that was the catch, in The Matrix, that many are led to believe: whether or not there is a Messianic message beneath the surface. Perhaps, there is,  but I do not see that as a Christian movie, just a     science-fiction movie which you can analyze anyway you want to. I had a hard time identifying scenes that were thoughts and scenes that were part of the 'realm of reality in the movie.' Anyway, I thought that The Truman Show had a big element of the 'eternal' versus the 'temporary'  in the realm of reality. Favorite Scenes: Trinity jumping from one building to another. Obviously no human can do that without some type of super power. But I don't think that it would be fair to compare her to the Trinity known by Christians. Favorite Quotes: Trinity: ' You're looking for him. I know because I was once looking for the same thing. And when he found me, he told me I wasn't really looking for him. I was  looking for an answer. It's the question that drives us. It's the question that brought you here.'  Morpheus:' I'm trying to free your mind, Neo. But I can only show you the door. You're the one that has to walk through it.' This type language sounds really Messianic. I guess one could watch the movie from that perspective. Perhaps it should be fun to have a discussion on the topic of the Christian message in 'The Matrix.' We will have to wait until the sequel to see if that was indeed a much larger Messianic side to the story.  I am not sure! Just watch and make your own analysis now and of any future Matrix. Actually I could argue both sides of the issue.",7,0,0,13 April 2000
The Thin Red Line," The movie is excessively subjective!
","The acting is good. The cast is fabulous, the photography is great, and there are moments of nice dialogue. After the first half hour of the movie, although I know about Guadalcanal I failed to see what their mission was. Obviously to get up the hill, but why? Guadalcanal was not was not mentioned in the movie once. The book was about Guadalcanal.  The movie is excessively subjective. As an adolescent  I loved watching movies such as Fellini's Rome, and other movies that were primarily subjective and invent theories and dwell in the abstract.  After years of graduate school and writing I have arrived at the conclusion that the more I know about a subject matter or a definition, the fewer words I have to use to describe them. This movie despite its good sides left me wondering why take so long to say whatever point there was to the movie. I hate to say it, but I think even  war-buffs would  want it to be  more spelled out. If you in a stage in your life that you like to figure things out,  even if it has to be discovered through guts and blood, this is a movie for you.   I rather have the author lead me to where he wants me to go than to wonder on my own. I like theories but there must be basis for theories, and metaphors.  A bunch of guys going in this uphill battle with no explanation of what they are doing is senseless.  Could it be the point is that war is senseless? I just wondered! In Apocalypse Now, Platoon, Saving Private Ryan the audience knows what their mission is right away,  not in this movie! I wonder  if I could I get the point if I were to watch it several times and knew nothing about Guadalcanal. Maybe  the dialogue would be clearer but just watching the movie in itself is not enough to go anywhere with it. If I have to read the book, and do research after I watch a movie, it means that the message was not clear in the movie. Movies  are about  story telling. If you cannot tell the story in a few sentences after you watch a movie then the movie fail to tell a story. This is the case at hand.",6,0,0,7 September 1999
Gladiator," The movie was awesome!
","I have not seen a movie about gladiators since I was a teenager. I have always wondered why don't they make movies about gladiators like they used to. Oh, well when I hear that 'Gladiator' was coming up last summer, I thought.  That is going to be a hit.  I believe that when I read  that Ridley Scott (Thelma & Louise, G.I. Jane) was directing it I knew the movie had to be good. I knew nothing about Russell Crowe 'Maximus Decimus Meridius,' Who is the Gladiator himself, perhaps because his name was not all over the place as it is now, I have movies that I am watching and I go? : Russell Crowe! The movie at hand is romantic, full of good principles and 'biceps' combined with great fights. I enjoyed the movie very much. I am trying to leave people's private lives outside their work. I thought that Russell deserved the Golden globe nomination that he has received and wish him the best in his career and private life as well. The Gladiator brought to mind many Biblical Characters, such as  David, Saul, and specially  Daniel. The movie was awesome! Favorite Scenes: Russell's hands passing through the tall grass. Really cool images. Favorite Quote: Juba: 'Can they hear you?'  Maximus Decimus Meridius: 'Who?' Juba: 'Your family. In the after  life.'  Maximus Decimus Meridius: 'Oh yes.'  Juba: 'What do you say to them?'  Maximus Decimus Meridius: 'To my son -- I tell him I will see him again soon. To keep his heels down while riding his  horse. To my wife... that is not your business.'",8,0,0,2 January 2001
The Birds," This movie is a classic Hitchcock .
","Scary and classic  Hitchcock (Vertigo) movie 'The  Birds' is a movie that I watched years ago and forgot everything except for those mean birds. I just watched it again and found it just as scary,  but also realized that there was no reasonable explanation for the bird's reaction, except that nature is just unpredictable.  I thought that the acting was great. I like Suzanne Pleshette (Rome Adventure) as Annie Hayworth and 'Mitch Brenner' Rod Taylor (Hong -Kong), and I had not realized until now that Veronica Cartwright (The Witches of Eastwick) was the girl who played 'Cathy Brenner' in this movie.   Also Melanie Daniels as 'Tippi Hedren' was Marnie in that movie also by Hitchcock. I thought it was interesting to see 'Jessica Tandy' (Driving Miss Daisy) playing a cold person such as Lydia Brenner.  Bodega Bay is a quaint little town and a great location, because Bodega Bay was so quiet until the birds started showing up one by one. My favorite quotes: Melanie Daniels 'How did you know my name.' Mitch : 'A little birdie told me.'  Favorite Scenes: Hitchcock's cameo walking dogs. Just sweet! This movie is a classic and a must see.",8,2,3,4 February 2000
