Antz," arguments regarding 'AntZ'
","Were it not for 'AntZ' and 'Akira', I would have completely given up on any kind of animated film.  Thankfully, though, these two movies have restored my faith in cartoondom as a viable way of telling a story.  I agree with pretty much all of the positive comments I've heard thus far, so I'll omit the repetitive yammering and refute the claims of the more negative commentary on 'AntZ'.Bad language?  The movie was rated PG.  The MPAA doesn't rate these movies just for their own amusement, folks.  If you don't want your kids to hear profane language, keep your moviegoing limited strictly to 'G' films. Otherwise, don't blame DreamWorks because your five-year-old's favorite new word is 'damn'.  It's not their fault.  It's yours.  Pay attention to the MPAA rating next time.Sexism? I read a comment claiming that 'AntZ' sucked on account of the fact that the 'ant social structure' was poorly portrayed: the males outnumbered the females, and the males ran everything.  If we're going to gripe about realism here, why not address the concept of talking ants (English, no less) that swing picks and wear WWII-style army helmets?  I vaguely recall having owned an ant farm, and they never formed big wrecking balls out of their own bodies.  Hence, realism is not an issue.It's boring?  Okay, I can understand how a child could get bored while watching this film.  However, taking into account the fact that's a PG film, most people should've known that right off the bat.  This is a more cerebral film.  A thinking adult with even a high school education should appreciate the social implications made in the movie, and a film buff should howl at the vast number of movie references made in 'AntZ'.  If that's too much to handle, stick to mindless drivel like 'Dumb & Dumber'.Woody Allen?  Damn right, Woody Allen.  Who could POSSIBLY better portray a neurotic ant in a colony of millions who feels that he is insignificant than him?An 'ugly' film?  Absolutely.  Lots of dark browns makes a lot more sense than Disney's baby blue hexapod, wouldn't you agree? Once again, this is a PG film, which means that people should have clued into the fact that it's not a 'family' movie.  Being, as it is, a more 'adult-oriented' film, it doesn't have to be all sunshine and rainbows. Why animate it at all, you ask? Especially in computer graphics?  (a) Do YOU think you could sit and watch an hour and a half of live actors dressed up in stupid-looking ant costumes?  (b) Computer animation offers unprecedented visual detail.This concludes my tirade.  You may now resume perusing the comments.",Null,1,2,30 June 1999
Dark City," thank God for smart movies
","It's about time somebody made a movie geared to a demographic other than the 4-second-attention-span-bearing average American. It's a lot smarter than the standard modern Hollywood fare, and a hell of a lot more interesting. Here's a story that reveals itself over the course of the film, as opposed to revealing all its big secrets in the first act.  It's also nice to see that someone can make a movie of this sort without including some kind of big fight scene every twenty minutes and that the entire doesn't rely entirely on big-name stars, special effects, and an easily-marketed soundtrack to draw an audience.",Null,0,1,29 December 1999
Any Given Sunday," One of the all-time best football flicks
","First, a tip to those who can't stand Oliver Stone movies yet keep going to see them, only to show up in here and gripe about them: no, Oliver Stone is not going to make a 'normal'-looking movie.  He's not going to make his movies to look exactly like every other mindless chunk of garbage that shows up at the Cineplex Odeon.  If you don't like his style, stop watching the movies. :-)On to 'Any Given Sunday'. Frankly, I thought it was great.  The performances were superb (even Stone himself as a sportscaster) and as always I found myself constantly being kept on my toes by Stone's visual style, particularly the football footage.Stone does an excellent job of capturing the essence of the game by giving us rapidly-edited high-speed footage.  Most of it is very 'in-close' and claustrophobic, and the intensity level is completely off the scale.  This frantic, chaotic feel is complemented by background music cranked to a level of discomfort.  This should give people a good idea what it's like to actually be a participant in a good old-fashioned smash-mouth football game.I didn't think Cameron Diaz could play a villain, I really didn't. Surprise, surprise, surprise, folks.  She comes through with a bald-faced viciousness that raised my eyebrows on more than a few occasions.  (However, it should be kept in mind that I *also* didn't think Angela Lansbury would make a good villain, and 'The Manchurian Candidate' proved me very wrong in THAT instance.)Pacino is, as always, Mr. Badass.  This time around, he's Mr. Badass with a heart and feelings.  He means business when he sets foot on the field, and he takes it hard when he is criticized.  All in all, a very believable performance.And as far as the length of the film goes... GOOD.  I LIKE long movies.  If a movie can hold my attention for three hours without letting me get up to smoke a cigarette or take a leak, then I consider it a success.The bottom line:  I rank it right up there with 'North Dallas Forty' and 'The Longest Yard'.  Never mind all this other nebulous junk like 'The Waterboy', 'Varsity Blues', and 'The Program.'  'Any Given Sunday' is where it's at.Oh, and I *do* have one complaint about the movie: whoever decided on the color schemes for the various football teams' uniforms (particularly the Dallas 'Knights') needs to be tested for color-blindness.",Null,0,0,29 December 1999
The Sixth Sense," Technically marvelous but keeps its ace in the hole showing
","This is a good example of a film that rests on its creative laurels and dispenses with all that icky 'story' nonsense.Excellent cinematography, lighting, acting, dialogue, and production design abound. It was refreshing to see Bruce Willis do well in a role that isn't summarized as 'make smartassed comments, kill terrorists'. The technical attributes are what make the movie worth seeing; the photography and lighting reflect the dreary subject matter of the film beautifully and with tension, where necessary.  It is for these things that I give 'The Sixth Sense' very high marks.So what's the problem?  Here's the problem.What does everybody that hasn't already seen this movie know about it? 'I see dead people.' It's on the trailers and it's spoofed constantly on TV for comic effect, so everybody knows that this 'gift' is the central focus of the story.  And that's fine with me.  There's just one problem:That's the WHOLE story.Little Cole sees dead people. Okay, so what of it? Since we already knew that from the trailers, the impact of the line and the revelation of that secret is lost when Cole spouts the line halfway into the movie.  I, for one, was left saying: 'we already knew that. NOW what?'At least the makers of 'The Crying Game' had the sense not to say 'Oh, by the way, IT'S A GUY!' in the trailers for THAT film.Other than that Cole sees dead people, there isn't really a whole lot going on in this film.  Okay, so the movie shows US some of the dead people.  Yes, it may make you jump in a couple of places, but that doesn't define a thriller.  I can sneak up behind a person and yell in his ear and make him flinch; that doesn't make me the master of suspense.By and large, the genuine creepiness that DOES take place in this movie is effective, but sparse and short-lived.  And since we already know about the dead people, there really isn't much left for the audience, except for one thing.***SPOILER WARNING***The writer did leave himself an ace in the hole.  The problem is that it's almost completely given away by the end of the movie, to folks with a keen eye and sharp senses.Everybody I knew that saw this movie before I did said: 'oh, man, it's great, you've gotta see it, the ending will blow your mind, etc.'  I started watching the movie.  Bruce Willis gets shot, and about twenty minutes later, since the shooting itself had not been brought up at all in the film since it took place, I started asking myself: 'okay, it was significant that the underwear-wearing guy in the bathroom blew his brains out... but that alone would have sealed the doctor's motivation for wanting to help this kid.  So why did the doctor have to get shot?'  Simple answer: so we can all find out at the end that he's already dead. Duh. Of course, that early in the film, it's only a hypothesis.  When the big secret is finally revealed, however, you've got so much evidence to support your theory packed into your head that there's no way you CAN'T be right. And, as it turns out, you ARE right. It's a surprise ending that fails to be a surprise.  Therefore, for me, there was nothing interesting about this film in terms of story. And quite frankly, I wasn't too interested in the whole 'I see dead people' concept to begin with.If you want to see a movie with an EFFECTIVE sucker-punch ending, try 'The Usual Suspects' or 'Fight Club'.",Null,0,0,31 May 2000
The Matrix," Sci-Fi movie? Action movie? Martial arts movie? Make up your mind!
","It's one thing to combine genres of stories and hit upon each one well enough that it works.  It's something else entirely to fumble about a bit with three genres and skim them, never really deciding what kind of story you want to tell.I will admit that upon first hearing what the concept behind 'The Matrix' was, I was extremely embittered, because I was at that very point in time writing a novel based around the exact same premise: humanity has been unknowingly trapped inside a 'false reality' brought about by machines that have realized that they are significantly smarter, more efficient, and more deserving of this planet than we are.After several months of seething and grinding my teeth, I finally decided that the only way I was going to be able to get the rage out of my system was to actually sit down and watch the movie.  I also decided that I would completely dismiss the anger if I actually liked what I saw. Unfortunately, I did NOT like what I saw.Style over substance. Welcome to American cinema.Breaking it down, piece by piece:CAST & ACTING-- Apparently, the primary function of even having people in this movie is so they can look cool and stylish. This function even overrides what would be common sense, within the confines of the narrative. Am I the only person to notice that they look really conspicuous walking through the city streets wearing black leather outfits? To nitpick... Laurence Fishburne is woefully underutilized. It doesn't take a master thespian to look cool and speak in enigmas. Yoda did it better, and he wasn't even played by a real person. Keanu Reeves, meanwhile, once again feeds his resume by standing around and looking dumbfounded, and like he has no idea what the hell is going on.  Now that he's mastered this facial expression, maybe he'll learn a couple more.LIGHTING & CINEMATOGRAPHY: These were the only things that really impressed me about 'The Matrix'. I liked that they used slightly green filtering for all the scenes taking place inside the computer system, and used darker black-and-blue set design for everything OUTSIDE of the system.  A lot of the camera angles were well chosen for their scenes.  However, the much-ballyhooed bullet-time photography that vomitously oversaturates almost every fight scene in the film doesn't really impress me, as it serves no real purpose other than to be eye candy.MUSIC: Oh, boy. 'Dragula' by Rob Zombie. Just what I wanted to hear again, after having heard it played on the radio four billion times when his 'Hellbilly Deluxe' album was released. Some of the other tracks are pretty good, although the orchestral score is immeasurably obnoxious.SPECIAL EFFECTS: Yes, they look very nice. Too bad nobody's yet realized that packing a movie full of computer graphics doesn't necessarily make the movie GOOD. Apparently, however, they're all you need if your sole objective is to make lots of money.SCI-FI ELEMENTS: There are some good things going on here, but not enough of them. The ultra-mechanized true reality is visualized well, and the premise is promising. What ends up happening, though, is that I get the feeling that this premise and visual style was used as an engine to make a really nifty-looking action/kung-fu flick. If only the movie had lived up to the concept's philosophical potential, this could have been another 'Blade Runner'. Instead, it tries to be something else. (see below)ACTION ELEMENTS: The action elements in 'The Matrix' were well done (by which I mean the gunplay and explosions; the kung-fu will be addressed shortly), although slightly overdramatized by gross misuse of slow-motion. Slow-motion, I think, should be used for no more than fifteen seconds of footage.  Showing an entire gunfight in slow-motion is simply gratuitous. However, the production team did a hell of a job in making it look nice. There's just something gratifying about watching walls and stone pillars shatter as bullets rip through them.  However, once again, there's not enough of this to really call 'The Matrix' an action flick.KUNG-FU ELEMENTS: My main problem with the kung-fu sequences in 'The Matrix' is that very little of it is achieved through any dexterity, coordination, or physical prowess of the actors, because very little of it is humanly possible, at all, period. And I know you're thinking, 'well it doesn't HAVE to be humanly possible because it's inside an artificial reality... and in a MOVIE, no less'.  That isn't really the issue.  What I'm getting at is that when I see kung-fu movies, I like to see the actors using their own skills, not smoke and mirrors, to accomplish mind-blowing feats.Overall, the film seems very non-committal as to what genre it is.  I like movies that can't be readily categorized, but not the ones that only defy categorization because the movie itself is a jumble.  'Pi', for example, defies categorization, but we know it's SOMETHING.  Whatever it is, it DEFINITELY is.  As for 'The Matrix', I guess it's whatever you want it to be.  It just doesn't do an outstanding job in any of its three parent genres.Going back to what I said at the beginning of this review...I'm still angry.",Null,0,0,31 May 2000
