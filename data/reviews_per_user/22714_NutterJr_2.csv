The Lobster," Not all love stories are the same
","Admittedly I could hardly wait for the new collaboration between the director Yorgos Lanthimos and his usual collaborator the screenwriter Efthimis Filippou (who also wrote Chevalier which won the top prize in LFF2015) in their first English speaking feature. And it was yet again a thoroughly stimulating absurd surrealistic dark comedy, unique to its core. Wrapped up with a violently emotive score unfolds a story about finding love against the clock in a concentration camp for loners or turned into a animal of choice. Colin Farrell and Rachel Weisz are great leads and Olivia Colman is an excellent supporting act in a film you won't quickly forget.",9,0,2,30 December 2016
Deadpool," My guilty pleasure of 2016
","There is always a guilty pleasure film every year that creeps into my favourites and in 2016 it is no other than Deadpool which takes the comic hero genre to another level of funny where even the Guardians of the Galaxy could not reach. This one is not about the action scenes (which there were in good doses of) or even gory ones (which there were plenty of), but more so about the little details of an excellent score including music from Wham!, the amazing funny and borderline rude one liners including a ton of in-movie jokes and in general the entire self-sarcastic nature of it. In fact, and regardless of the admittedly very thin plot, it was so much fun that I had to watch it twice.",8,2,7,31 December 2016
