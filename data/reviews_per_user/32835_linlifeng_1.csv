The King's Speech," If Forrest Gump was born in a royal family
","A story like this would very easily convey the message that any moron can do the job of King of England, probably better than the king himself. If you take it all apart, he is no better intellectually than Homer Simpson or even Forrest Gump, and above that he can't even speak. A retard like this can still pull out the job of being the King without a problem. The greatness of this film is that despite the normal thinking above, it managed to manipulate our emotions into actually feeling that we have a great and righteous king and root for him. Marvelous. Years ago, when people use the phrase 'King's speech', they would probably be referring to the 'i have a dream' speech. There's gonna be some ambiguities after this movie.",8,0,0,20 January 2011
