The Blair Witch Project," Too Much Press Ruins a Great Movie
","You're doing yourself a disservice if you are reading the reviews before viewing the film.  After reading the first 20 reviews here, it was clear that some people knew too much for their own good.I had the good fortune of viewing this film A) by myself and B) with no prior knowledge of what it was about.  Naturally throughout the film I was under the impression that I was witnessing the final moments of 3 missing student filmmakers.  It's the realism that makes the film truly scary.To read comments like 'bad camera work' or 'bad sound editing' is difficult for me.  If you notice the camera work, or notice the sound... you've missed it.This film will become a victim of it's own success.  If somebody had told me what it was about before I saw it, I probably wouldn't have made it through the first 10 minutes.  Instead, it ended up being a terrifying movie that I thoroughly enjoyed.",Null,1,1,26 July 1999
