Ali," Makes you want to do some research
","This is a well acted film by Smith, Jamie Foxx, and Jon Voight. This film assumes that you know a little history about Ali and glosses over certain facts in Ali's life during that period i.e. the controversial 'Phantom punch' he laid on Sonny Liston during their second fight, or how Frazier was sent to the hospital after the brutal beating his received during their first fight (the movie makes it look like Ali was some out of shape bum who didn't have any fighting skills left).This movie makes me want to do more research on Ali so I can understand his supporting cast in the movie. I saw in the credits that the character of Larry Holmes was in the movie!?! What scene was he in? The same with Floyd Patterson. I know that Ali beat the snot out of him in the 60's, but the movie did not have any scenes of that fight.Go see this movie if you are an Ali fan or at least brush up on some history if you are not!",Null,0,0,4 January 2002
