Whip It," Not Shallow
","A film about those confusing and painful growing-up years. Similar to 'Juno' in some ways but I liked this more. Portrays a girls search for meaning and acceptance with honesty and heart. While she does go against her parents wishes, rebellion is not glorified like I thought it would be. A thoughtful comedy",8,1,1,12 February 2020
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Excellent
",Possibly the best Starwars film to date with the exception of Empire Strikes back. They should scrap the Rey storyline and make more 'stories',8,0,1,12 February 2020
This Is the End," Disappointing
",I didn't like this one. It had some genuinely hilarious moments but overall it was a big disappointment. I always like when Holywood makes fun of itself and the idea of a whole bunch of famous comedians playing themselves in a apocalyptic movie sounded like an amazing premise. The problem is that they portayed themselves as such selfish idiots that after awhile you want them to die...and yet they end up in heaven. I couldn't empathize with the characters at all and it's hard to laugh at what you can't relate to. Just watch the 3 funny parts on YouTube.,2,1,3,12 February 2020
12 Angry Men," Classic
",Almost the entire film is shot in one small room and yet manages to be riveting from beginning to end. Outstanding performances by all. This is one of my all time favorites.,10,3,3,12 February 2020
Full Metal Jacket," Important Film
","Sobering. Best known for the boot camp scenes at the beginning of the film, this one tackles the horrors of the Vietnam war in its own unique way. You should see it, but you'll probably only need to see it once.",7,0,0,12 February 2020
The Village," Powerful
",Still probably my favorite of M. Night's films. An ode to the power of love in the form of a thriller. Beautiful and unique. It's worth watching for the soundtrack alone. But the less you know about it the better.,10,3,3,12 February 2020
American Psycho," Pointless
","Didn't like it. An unpredictable, confusing, and gruesome, horror film. It raises many questions and answers none of them.",3,1,4,12 February 2020
District 9," Silly
",A disturbingly plausible alien film that gradually descends into absurdity. Great intro -goofy ending,6,0,3,12 February 2020
Coco," Artistic and Deep
",Pixar knocked it out of the park again. There were certainly some holes in the plot but I think they are minor and easy to forgive. A causionary tale about following your dreams at the expense of others.,9,0,1,12 February 2020
Lincoln," Worth Seeing
",Abe the politician. More about the fight to abolish slavery than Lincoln himself,4,0,1,12 February 2020
Black Snake Moan," Powerful
",Terribly brutal and sweet at the same time. An old broken man helping a young broken woman. Deep pain and redemption portrayed honestly,10,0,0,12 February 2020
Big Fish," Not Good
",Be a fantastic liar and everyone will love you in the end? Visually stimulating but weird and troubling,4,0,2,12 February 2020
The Greatest Game Ever Played," Underrated
",Not a sports film guy but this is excellent. For those sceptical that a movie about golf could be interesting -fear not,8,0,0,12 February 2020
Blade Runner," Overrated
","Like a wierd dream you're happy to wake up from. This film creates an unsettling, mysterious, atmosphere that some people love and others do not. I am the latter",3,3,6,12 February 2020
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Fight Like a Gentleman
","It's part James Bond spoof, part James Bond homage, part Tarantino. Not exactly sure why, but I love this movie. After discovering it I watched it 5 times in the span of a week. I never do that. Very entertaining",9,0,0,12 February 2020
Hacksaw Ridge," Inspiring
","An incredible story that is genuinely inspiring. Despite the fact that l thoroughly disagreed with some of the protagonist's beliefs, I couldn't help but be moved by his courage and integrity. Like the protagonist, the film is, almost annoyingly, idealistic and hopeful but it eventually succeeds in winning you over.",10,1,1,12 February 2020
Valkyrie," Well Done
",How do you make a genuinely interesting and suspensful film when the general outcome of the story is already known? Well...they did it! A facinating tale of courageous men who almost succeeded in assaninating Hitler. Good performances all around -including Tom Cruise,8,0,0,12 February 2020
The Martian," Intense
",Great survival story. Likable character and edge-of-your-seat action. Captured my imagination,7,0,0,12 February 2020
