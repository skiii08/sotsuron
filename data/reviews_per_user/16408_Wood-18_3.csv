Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
","*yawn* what a boring film *sigh*the first battle scene is great, and I was pumped when the movie began and there were all those lightsabers and lasers and explosions and stuff...little did I know...I guess the pod racing scene was cool too...or shall I say the effects in the pod scene were great...It seems as though Georgie has gone the way of Jurassic Park, Twister et al...lots of effects, along with little, and uninteresting, story...not even effects could totally save this movie...Darth Maul was the only cool character...and he was featured for all of 10 minutes and died...Alas, I like everyone else, have seen episodes 4-6 and won't let one movie get me down...Viva la Star Wars!",Null,0,1,7 April 2000
The Shawshank Redemption," Great, great, great movie
","This is by far and away the best movie I have ever seen.   If you haven't seen it, do so.  (If you don't know the movies outcome, definately see it!).Everything about this movie is outstanding.  What most people notice first about great movies is the fine acting.  Not only is this film's acting superb, but the script, the costumes, the scenery, the directing...everything...just outstanding.  Rent it for the first time...rent it again...I recently sat through TNT's double presentation, and it still had me totally absorbed, even the second time around.",10,0,0,21 October 1999
The Matrix," wow
","what a great movie...it was so good it overshadowed Keanu's acting and I didn't even notice how bad it was...(I'm assuming it was, couldn't tell ya fer sure!)the visual effects were like nothing I've ever seen...The storyline was very original and I actually found myself, quite literally, 'on the edge of my seat' towards the end...holy moley what a film!",10,0,0,7 April 2000
