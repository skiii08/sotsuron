Requiem for a Dream," Aronofsky and his masterpiece
","What and excellent movie. I have no words to describe this masterpiece. I mean Ellen Burstyn is just amazing. The other actors to. The editing is sublime and the camera moves are brilliant. I really tell my friends that it is a must see movie for everyone. I think that everyone in the all world should really see it. It scares you really, i mean, it's for the people that don't take drugs because it will show then what are the consequences of living in a dream world. It's for the people who take drugs because, i think, this will open their eyes. It's a movie that every kids, mothers, fathers, grandfathers, grandmothers, etc, should see. I really Have no Words to describe this movie. 10 out of 10.",10,5,9,9 April 2008
Shutter Island," This is how a Masterpiece can be poor rated
","First of all let me say this movie is for me... the best of 2009. I say 2009 because the studio should have put it when it was finished instead of putting it in a 'good money' season. It should went to the Oscars and won.. Now i am gonna explain my title. The world is now full of popcorn movies and fans of those kind. I mean i liked 2012, Avatar and so on and so on but its a movie with a real story, a real heart, a real Art that moves me. Today, everything people want to see is Vampires, aliens, super heroes, wolfs, etc, etc... And when finally when a movie obligates you to think the is no turn back. Hollywood is at a time where movie are made so people don't have to think for themselves... they just have to buy the ticket and be shoot with fast piece cuts and explosions, robots and etc. .... Most of the critics i have seen for this movie are always complaining about the end being to rushed... being to bad... there is actually almost 80% of the people complaining about the fact that in the end Andrew stayed Crazzy...Let me try to explain... Andrew Creates an alter ego named Teddy and with it a full conspiracy world. He believes, and we believe at the beginning that he is the only person who knows the truth but that's not what is happening.. There's a great review up here saying this is the kind of movie where a Last sentence explains everything... and i am gonna explain to u all..When Andrew is sited on the stairs, just in the final scene and Chuck comes giving him a cigarette, Chuck ask 'Now What'? This is the DOCTOR Chuck trying to see how is patient his... if i continues sane or not. Andrew looks at him and says they have to get out and tel the world about the experiments.. Chuck realizes that he and the other doctors have failed and signals to the other doctor telling the public that Andrew is insane again. So, since it has failed and Andrew is a dangerous man they have to lobotomize him. But the we, the public, get another great moment in this movie. Andrew says before he left: 'After being here Chuck... what would you like? To live like a monster? Or to die like a normal man' ... This simple sentence gives us the big picture.. Andrew is sane... and is aware of all the things he has done ... He knows he can.. and will return to that crazy state, like he has before, and believes the best for him is to die wile sane and maybe see his family again in another place... This is the heart of the story and i am really sorry for those who just didn't get it and because of that just give it a 1 out of 10... Like i said... its a shame how the Popcorn has win... over the real ART..",10,3,7,31 March 2010
2012," Probably the Best Catastrofe Film of all time.
","First of all let me say i went to the cinema thinking it was gonna be a smash special effects movie and not so good story.. after that i find out that the special effects were even great than i expected and the story, although still predictable, quite good. The actors are great, Harelson is just amazing in his little role, the action is fast and after all its a must see movie in theaters. For those o just download movies believe me... its a huge mistake. I dare to say its the best Emmerich movie.. even greater than Independence Day. The Scene with the vulcane is just breathtaking. I also work on special effects and i was amazed will all those little details. Of course that before the movie u already know the story because its the basic storyline for a catastrophe movie but who cares?After all i went to the cinema to have fun and believe me, it was a hell of a ride..",10,3,14,13 November 2009
The Happening," Good script... worse acting EVER!!!
","The Happening it's actually one of the worse movies i've ever seen. I mean i really had to make some efforts to see it until the end. The story is actually good and intelligent but the acting? I mean... that actress that plays Walberg's girlfriend, i don't know who she is, is by far the worse actress i've ever seen. And how about Walberg? There's just no actor in this movie that look real to me.. The directing it's not at all like six sense or signs but its also good. There could be more effects, the soundtrack doesn't help sometimes but again the acting ruins this movie so much. 5 out of 10 (just because of the story)",5,0,3,6 October 2008
War of the Worlds," The Movie of the Hear until now
","Aliens. Mass Destruction. A Big Disaster movie. Since Independence Day we haven't really seen a lot of Alien Invasions on Hearth. Well, believe me this is the best movie about aliens Invasions so far. I think that the only thing we have to say to talk about this movie its just: 'A Steven Spielber Movie'. The men of Close Enconters and E.T. plays with this things again and do it very well. I really enjoy to spend my money on this movie, and that doesn't happen many times. Its a Big movie, with an excellent acting of Tom and Dakota. I have no words to describe this film. I think that say 'FANTASTIC' its not enough to classify this picture. I need a Powerful word.",10,0,2,6 July 2005
