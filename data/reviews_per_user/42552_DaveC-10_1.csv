Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," all I could have hoped for
","With all the hype it received, it would have been easy for Star Wars Episode One: The Phantom Menace to fall flat on its face.  Luckily, it did not do so.  The special effects were amazing, the plot was interesting, and the actors all did a great job of filling the roles.  I also enjoyed the way that the foreshadowing was employed, and I left the theaters psyched for episodes 2 and 3 already.  In closing, I left the movie grinning, didn't quit for a while, and look forward to seeing it again.",7,0,0,20 May 1999
