The Lobster," Disappointing ending
",So anyway what can we say about this movie this movie is really not good it's actually very good but the ending sucks it's interesting you have good acting you have an interesting storyline to begin with you have great soundtrack good effects you watched very interesting but then just after three fourths of the movie you are confronted with such terrible nonsense that I won't review for the ones who haven't seen the movie yet but it's it's very interesting only sad thing is that the story at the ending became an example of Hollywood's needing to finish the story when they don't have the IDS yet so stupid if the guy who wrote the story took a bit of more time to work it congrats Jesus it would have been a great movie,8,0,1,16 March 2019
Angels & Demons," about Dan Brown and Ron Howard
","the first half of the movie was very boring. it was as if Dan Brown was showing his writing capabilities without a real story, 'look I'm Dan Brown and I can write a new story about old things that did occur!' bad directing too. as if Ron Howard was saying 'look I'm Ron Howard and I make movies'. I wanted to leave the cinema and go home, there I would be able to do far more interesting things than wasting my lifetime with watching such BEEP as 'Angels & Demons'.luckily enough for me, the second half of the picture was superb. it was as if Brown and Howard found a perfect match. thus, the construction of the film is really good: the first half it's boring as hell and everyone wants to leave the building, but the second half makes it worth you 'lost' your money.still, the acting performances are bad. really bad. it's the story of the second half that really made my day. but even then, there are some things that aren't explained very well in the movie. why all this clues? why this organized search? don't worry, you get the answers if you think about it, but that will only happen if you a) read the book. or b) talked about the movie during the ride home.conclusion: hats off to Dan Brown and Ron Howard, they did a really good job working together, even though the movie itself has got it's faults.",6,1,2,21 May 2009
The Sound of Music," the best
","I like it. I like it a lot, to be exact. To tell you the truth, I would be another person if I hadn't saw this movie. I like this movie so I couldn't live without it. And I mean that. It's an oldie, but I love golden oldies.",10,1,7,5 March 2003
Wayne's World," between the devil and Wayne's World II
","some pictures are stupid, other's are fun. Wayne's World is so stupid that it becomes funny. but you'll have to be in the mood for a comedy if you watch this. especially with a comedy like this one. the first time I saw this movie, I thought it was boring. in fact it is. you see the stupidities of two young men who are trying to have a television show. it's predictable that someone will notice them and give them a chance, which will lead to giant mistakes or jokes (if you may call it a joke). in fact, it is a joke. it's one big joke and it ain't funny. if someday the devil will make you choose between damnation or watching Waynes World II (because there really is a sequel on this), what will you choose? I know. I will choose...",2,1,5,6 April 2009

Public Enemies," isn't that good
","I didn't like it at all, I was suspecting to see another crime epic like The Untouchables, but I was wrong. Bale and Depp doesn't act bad, but I don't know, seems to me like they both played a version of themselves instead of the characters they were supposed to portray. Depp looks like Depp this time, he has no wig or something, in Public Enemies he looks just like himself and that is a shame, I know Depp could have act much better, people who see this movie will agree: he's just himself, he's not Dillinger. Lawrence Tierney was Dillinger in one of the first movies about the life of JD (Johnny Depp/John Dillinger?) and he did it good, he was a real JD. Christian Bale had got the same problem: he doesn't act at all. in fact, his appearance here reminded me at the part he played in American Psycho. conclusion: Public Enemies isn't that good.",6,0,1,29 July 2009
Us," Kinda messy
",It is really so sad that nothing of the great ideas of us have come into fruition and yet look at other people and doing it is a marvelous thing to think about the effects of one movie on so many people all over the world in the dating and having fun with it is remarkable and in this movie was succeeded especially with the special effects and the camera work and the acting so the story itself is kind of messy kk,8,1,5,9 May 2019
The Irishman," Prredicted Oscar Winner 2020
",So anyway NDT Irishman was a stupid movie it was much too long and of course merch too much music in the music that was in the movie return much too much and many two times and asthma since we don't like that then that we have all the things of course with Robert De Niro and everybody's much too old was much too slow the first part was born in the second thought it was interesting but then all of a sudden have for the second part or just the story ends really so you're just no longer interested and then it takes way too long then they and all these things and then you say is this really what happened because as far as I know the movie with Jack Nicholson called how far from 1992 or something was much much better and but for the rest can be said is of course that's we don't know really what happened to Hoffa and I don't know if you'll ever know I don't know if this movie contains the recent developments are just the hollywoods exploitation of the Jews I don't know have you really never know why it's another thing to know it's not really worth and I list will be best picture or once upon a time in Hollywood both pictures suck like terrible then you don't they don't deserve it I hope another movie wins best picture but it wouldn't be logic. This would be best picture and all the movie because the Jews wouldn't let it they count on money and they bet on this or once upon a time in Hollywood so anyway who's going to win nobody knows and we will just see in sha Allah Allahu Akbar has Muslims don't care,2,2,5,14 December 2019

",Boring movie. Disgusting music. Lowlife people of Dublin. Total waste of time. The characters in it speak words as if they are constantly having their mouth filled with cotton.

The Hateful Eight," Great movie
","I waited very long to see Quentin Tarantino's 'The Hateful Eight'. It's the kind of movie that makes you fall asleep if you're not completely willing to wait for it and sit it through: still it's no tormenting procedure of nothingness like the one we saw in Akerman's 'Jeanne Dielman' (1975); something does happen here, only issue is that it goes so incredibly slowly... yet not as slowly as Andy Warhol's'Empire' (1964). For the reward is there if you have enough patience: the cinematography, the acting, the dialogues, the music. All is perfect in Quentin's movies and so it was here: there were even enough plot twists that got me jumping, or at least moving around on my seat a bit more. Yup, a big 9/19 for a movie I assumed worthy of 4/10 before I saw it completely. Bravo, mister director sir!!!",9,0,3,4 May 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Skywalker sucks
","I liked Rey's armpit hair, it means the actress herself is hairy and that is exciting me more than The Rise of Skywalker could ever do. The story has its failures and plot holes. It is stupid and cursed after the Illuminati ritually butchered Debbie Reynolds and her daughter irl. The failure of star wars is now the fault of Disney. Mickey mouse leads to Britney Spears and the music industry: the media really is the Empire.",3,29,43,22 April 2020
Burn After Reading," Tom Cruise rules!
","if you like to take a bath during a picture, you should view Burn after Reading. why? because it's a worthless piece of BEEP. I mean, really: if you take a long, hot shower, you won't miss a thing, because the story doesn't make any sense. you can go to the toilet and be sure you flush it, but you can never be sure about the BEEPing storyline in this picture. it's like they confessed on the documentaries about this film: they simply wrote 'funny' ideas on a BEEP of paper and they connected the BEEPing things with each other, no BEEPing BEEP if they were logical. now, I love logical movies. films with a good story, even films with a difficult story like Mission Impossible (the first one) - wow Tom Cruise rules - , but if you expect the same quality of the newest Coen picture, forget it. see another BEEPy movie, but leave this one alone. the Coen brothers really disappointed me a lot. I trusted them. now they BEEPed everything with this BEEPing bar. this picture proved me Tom Cruise rules, because he didn't appear in this BEEPy movie.",7,1,3,21 April 2009
Watchmen," so perfect I can't find words to describe it
","Watchmen is so good, I saw it three times already and I realize I have a Watchmen addiction I mean really it's so breathtaking every scene it's a movie that will break boundaries there violence, but that no so bad, because it's meant to be a story on itself, outside our society, in a different world but still I find many things that we nowadays share with Watchmen the music, for instance it's so good, so perfectly put together with the images on the screen my favourite movies are Scorpio Rising, Forrest Gump and Watchmen you see many people being hit at on this wonderful music okay the comic is cool too I don't disagree with that I just think that every living soul should see this movie it changed my life completely I'm very sorry I cannot be more specific on some scenes, but I don't want to pull the magic away before you've seen it yourselves the parts I don't like about Watchmen are details like the sex scene not the first one you see but the second it's on music that makes you laugh instead of tender oh I'm so mad at myself I don't find words to show the goodness of Watchmen let me put is thus: if I were king or somebody like a king, somebody with a lot of authority, I would make everybody see Watchmen but not only that I would say they all have to vote 10 on IMDb for this movie, so it can go back where it belongs: in the top 250!",10,5,11,29 March 2009
Knowing," what I was thinking before the shock entered my mind
","I went to see this movie because the trailer made me curious what was all the fuss about with those mysterious numbers. now I've seen the film, I can split it in two: the first half was boring as hell. Nicolas Cage acted as if he was looking in a mirror. he was the worst actor of the picture. they could easily replace him with Kevin Costner. Costner may be a diva (as I have heard), but I really really like him. but Cage? what was the last movie where he was in that was good? anyway, so here I was trying to look at my watch, because the time seemed long. this movie was even worse than Disaster Movie, which is a movie that must be appreciated by the total sum and not the parts. lucky for me, this Knowing flick had a fantastic second half, which made me forget all about the first. by that, it made the total sum correct. this movie is BEEPing great. not superb, but still good. the second part was all about these terrible things that happen (maybe the numbers have an actual reason???) and the first accident really blew me away. it shocked me. not with electricity, but just with the content (which I will not reveal for anyone who hasn't seen the movie yet). the only thing I can complain about, is the trailer. it shows us too much already. so take my advice, avoid the trailer as possible but don't miss this film!",6,1,3,1 April 2009
Monsters vs. Aliens," quality vs quantity
","and there I was, watching Monsters vs Aliens. it must be easy to make an animated movie. how stupid can someone be? I can see the company sitting on their desks already, thinking what else they could make a movie of. then suddenly, some of the 'artists' jumps up and says 'I have a great idea! let's make a movie about monsters and aliens and let them fight each other!' probably it has been like that. in a time like this, where animated features are being made like dozens in a year, it's a competition to make the best picture. oh wait... did I say 'best' picture? guess again. it's not about quality anymore, it's about quantity. if the movie could make money the most, it's considered a 'good' movie. and you know what? this junk movie actually does make movie a lot! it's easy, it's like a formula: make something kids could enjoy and you will have millions, or perhaps even... billions??? (anoying Dr Evil laugh) I was very happy to go see this, but when I did, I was praying for some beep that would come up, so I would have a reason to go to the lavatory. I hoped I could puke a bit, my own beep would be more interesting to look at than this movie (which is not flawless).so why did I stay? good question. well, I was there with somebody who actually did like the movie, so I couldn't just get away.if you want quality, don't see this monstrous piece of 'art'. it's too bad I can't give this movie less than 1, so I'll have to give it 1 point, which it does not deserve at all.",1,10,22,7 April 2009
Quantum of Solace," so, mister Bond, are you ready to talk?
","the only reason I bought the DVD, is that I'm an obsessive Bond fan. I want to have every James Bond movie in my possession. the film itself, it's so boring. I tried to watch it again yesterday, but I turned it off. it' so stupid! I don't understand the director. how is it possible they have made such crap? I don't like it. In fact, it's a sequel to Casino Royale. but Casino Royale was also a stupid Bond movie. why did the elements disappear, those things of which you know you're watching a Bond movie? Craig walks through both pictures as if he's on LSD. why? Quantum of Solace is the worst sequel ever made. the story is so without any storyline, I guess the director must have been thinking the movie would only be shown to retards. the villains are so unBondlike, with everything you see in a Van Damme picture (thus no personalities, only violence). I would like to say: don't watch this film. And what's the meaning of the title?",1,10,15,5 April 2009

1917," Carrying what around? It's nothing but a stupid war movie between us for you and me.
","All the time I was staring at nothing. It wasn't interesting. There were no women present. There was no human sexuality present as a corruptive presence, but it was a bodily fact that the dripping corpses of the soldiers knew enough wisdom to be teasing the temptive toasts to their amazing friends called the boms at home. Barely did the camera ever leave the sanctuary of wine with mud and water among German bombs and dreams to talk to the dying in what they were doing. I mean, really. How the heck can a little more time of fragments of shellshock under the skin of problem make use of sex in the woods where the challenge for the brother was most likely to find the other although the three years of request coming before we're rejecting his own situation over the other; now where to find but to complain about the nonsense of his wife, embarrassing to recognize a simple tree on the program with her clothes on. Yuck yuck for such a movie.",3,2,11,30 January 2020
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," we like this movie because we like who we are
","okay we see this movie and everything that we suspect that will happen, does actually happen. so why do we love this picture? why do we give this picture so many points? let me begin with the ending. the movie ends the way it does, because otherwise there would be no message. we all know the message from the beginning of the picture, however, and we can tell how the picture is going to end, because we know the rules of Hollywood. we know Hollywood loves making films with a moralistic message. in this movie, that message, the lesson we can learn from all we witness, is way too obvious. so why do we still love this kind of picture? that's not so difficult. we love this kind of picture, because it shows us what we suspect to see, what we want to see. it actually learns us the moral we already know and we like that because by that the movie gives us the feeling we are watching a memory of ourself, something we already know. because we already know what we will see (even if we haven't seen it yet and even if the climax may be shocking for us), we get an approval of ourself. because we like who we are (well, the most of us do), we like this movie.and that's all there is. this movie isn't a good movie, it's all an illusion. we are watching ourself on the screen and we are hypocrites enough to believe we haven't seen this before and everything is alright. even if we leave the cinema with a feeling of 'good it's just a movie' we are telling ourselves a lie.this movie is one big lie, there are many faults in it, I guess almost 24. I know it's not easy to understand (because of the so called difference in time), but this movie shows us a mirror. we like this movie because we like who we are.",6,1,4,29 April 2009
The Evil Dead," Evil Dad
","In my life I saw 2 movies who scared the sh*t out of me. The first one was CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST, in '79. The other was EVIL DEAD, a few years later. Although HOLOCAUST is even harder, EVIL DEAD still is one of my favourites. The story is origineel, and it's perfect directed by Sam Riaimi, who also directed movies such as THE GIFT (with Keano Reeves). Bruce Campbell is excellent as Ash, a man who doesn't know what danger's ahead. Remarquable is the fact that a member of the Riami family also plays a role in the movie. Really scary music. This movie is a must for every horror freak like me, but still I've got to say that you've gotta be careful with the UNCUT-version. At the backside you see Ash without a leg, but that scene isn't in the movie on that particular tape. Be sure it's really UNCUT before you buy it, is my advice. BTW: don't spend your money at the CUT-version. It's a worthless piece of junk.",9,0,1,17 March 2003

Avatar," what is Kevin Costner thinking about 'Avatar'?
","okay, so the first part was terrible, really awful. it reminded me at 'Dances with Wolves', and though I really love that movie and I'm a big fan of Kevin Costner, I just couldn't believe what James Cameron had done: Cameron took 'Dances with Wolves' and mutilated it into 'Avatar', a film of which he says he's very proud, that it's groundbreaking and that it's opening the portal for future generations, making 3D-movies. ri-i-i-ight... let's start with the special effects: they are known as ow so huge, but I didn't saw a zip. another thing: I'm half blind, my left eye is dead, so I really didn't have anything with that three dimensions effect. ow, so the director wasn't thinking on pleasuring people with sight disabilities? I would say he didn't. but let's forget that fact, and concentrate on the story: it's bullBEEP, it's nothing, I couldn't care less about what was happening, the storyline was unsatisfying and the pace was way too slow to keep me interested a single bit.but the second part of the movie was unbelievable good. it swept me away, I was sitting there with my mouth open. not the special effects were admirable, even though some may say they were, but the story was really interesting, I wanted to know how it all ended. one could say the second part saved the movie for me, now I totally understand why it's such a wave. let's embrace this movie and give it all the awards it could get.still, I'm wondering what Kevin Costner is thinking about Avatar, because it's only his 'Dances with Wolves' in a science fiction coat. nevertheless, both were great movies, but I've already seen 'Dances with Wolves' seven times, and I'm hoping I will never ever ever have to watch 'Avatar' again.",9,2,9,19 December 2009

If you haven't seen SLIH, you just cannot call yourself a true filmfreak. To anyone who actually reads this and hasn't seen it, my advice to you is to run to the videostore and not just to rent it, but to buy it! This movie has changed my life totally. I'm sure it will change yours too (in a positive way, off course).It's strange that the teenagers now call themselves moviegoers, still if they haven't seen any good movie. I regret this certainly and I hope someday there will come a time when people will know real values.",10,3,7,22 October 2004
Pulp Fiction," an original piece of art
","I think Pulp Fiction is really misunderstood. Many friends don't like the movie, because they think it's too difficult. Pulp Fiction is one of Tarantino's best, but I still think Reservoir Dogs is a much better movie. But what I do like, is the fact that Tarantino always uses the same actors. They're all great! Think about it: Harvey Keitel (who played mr. White in Reservoir Dogs) , Uma Thurman (Batman & Robin), Ving Rhames (Mission:Impossible), Tim Roth (also Reservoir Dogs) ,... I just think it's fantastic! Go on and make many other movies like that, Quentin!!!",9,1,2,1 March 2003

Inception," Why I hate Inception
","there are a lot of reasons why I didn't like Inception. to begin with the fact I was disappointed in the story, I find this the worst movie since Shutter Island. but that's no coincidence! what's the link between Inception and Shutter Island? Leonardo DiCaprio! wait... does this mean Dicaprio only acts in bad movies? no, because Leonardo DiCaprio can act, even though he always does the same thing and looks the same way he did in the last picture you've seen with him. it only means DiCaprio chooses to work on promising films that end up as no good. and why is Inception a bad picture? now here's the point! it's a stupid picture, with no mystery in it at all! am I joking?off course I'm not! the so called twists in the end are easy to come up with, so that when the clues are shown during the show, you can easily guess what they will turn out to be. what we really should be asking ourselves is this: if I had the choice between a James Bond movie and Inception, which one of the two would you prefer to see? answer: the James Bond movie. however, this is not the case with other movies directed by Christopher Nolan! Bond versus The Prestige? Bond loses. the same with The Dark Knight or Memento. and here's why: Inception is deception, because it's no good movie. I rest my case. I hate Inception. you like it? okay, tell me why.",6,6,16,22 July 2010

Flight," The Movie goes Down, Long Live Hollywood.
","this movie is not a good movie. I've seen quite some good movies, and this is not one of them. I'm a big Denzel Washington-fan, but this movie makes me dislike the man more than I could dislike Carmen Elektra in Disaster Movie. Denzel Washington was not acting at all, he was just repeating his act of Man on Fire. at least he must have listened to my comment on that movie and played here on constant 'I'm on overdose'-scale/-attitude. at least the best part of the movie came in less than a second at the beginning, when Denzel wook up next to a very beautiful woman. at that point in the movie (the beginning, thus), I simply knew that this movie was gonna be dynamite; it didn't get any better than that. be careful with movies that show a naked woman at the beginning; it is all they have to offer. the rest of the movie will be in most of the cases one big bugger. this movie proofs this theory once more. if you want a nice television movie, sure, you have to be here, but for the rest, not worth a single price. if this movie does win any price, it just would show that Hollywood has nothing more to offer. the movie goes down, long live the plane. unfortunately just a bit too little scenes of the actual flight, and no mystery, but big time disappointment. show it again and I'll puke.",3,4,9,16 February 2013

Was it be detected very interesting it was original and it was nice to see and the camera was known as the colors were correct it is just plain the perfect and then the ending was a bit all came together in a bit too fast maybe but it was a lie I mean the ending when it's maybe a bit too too quickly all of a sudden but it was very nice and if there was a nice guys stood it would be nice but then on the other hand I'm not a real fan of prequels and sequels or whatever I just thought if it was up to me I would always loved this movie and we'll see it again and again and again but that doesn't happen anymore with the use of nowadays cuz of course these people of the Young generation day old Bates Wells secret because it brings money knows this but this movie really was great just original I like the originality of this movie it was so incredibly great even though I have a headache because of what's going on I sometimes get here we will we Will we Will the alarm of one of the cars in the street and of course it made a lot of pain in my head now boom boom boom boom boom and I don't feel like it but the movie I did like in Atlanta to see with my girlfriend my little bitty bitty bitty and I love her so much and it was great it was a bit of all of together and it was a nice movie inshallah Allahu Akbar the Muslims like this movie,9,0,2,23 November 2019
All the President's Men," I wasn't Born yet
","What a great film! I bought the DVD years ago, but I always refused to watch it. This simply for the reason I don't like political movies. I mean, if you want to know about politics, look at the news today. Why bother what happened yesterday? The future, that's what counts. By now I realized my thoughts didn't make any sense, because we must look at our past to understand the present, and even more to get the future. Movies like 'Nuit et Brouillard' aren't made for fun (maybe some sadists will say I'm wrong, but I'm not one of them). They are made for the future. For example: I wasn't born yet when the Watergate Scandal occurred. Thanks to this fantastic film, I now can learn about it and form my own thoughts about it. And it's true, the suspense was killing me. The ending comes so suddenly, I was hoping for a good ending. Is it a good ending? Ask that question yourself. Only two minutes before the final frame of this epic journalist movie, was it made clear that happened what had to happen. Let's hope and pray that in the future someday some guy is going to say he'll make a movie about our present politics. Then we'll see in the future of the present the past of today.",6,1,5,6 May 2008
