Requiem for a Dream," Awesome movie, very hard to watch.
","This is an incredible movie.  Very moving.  Very disturbing, almost too disturbing.  Requiem for a Dream takes you through the changing period in the lives of four people.  You watch as they each strive for their goals, while they choose to ignore the downward spiral that each life is truly taking.  In the end, each one has given up, as the rest of the world moves on in its usual manner.  Each of them see the manifestation of their dream come incredibly close, just to watch it tear away from them in the end. This movie is not for the faint of heart, it is very depressing in its pessimistic realism.",9,0,1,11 December 2001
