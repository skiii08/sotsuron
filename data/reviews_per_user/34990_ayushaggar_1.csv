Airlift," Akshay Kumar plays a role who masterminded the dramatic rescue operation during the first Gulf War in 1990.
","film is well shot, with cinematographer Priya Seth achieving the right mix of impressive aerial shots and cramped hand-held bits, and reasonably well-textured with credible Middle Eastern detailing.There are hiccups -- like Kumar singing a Hindi song moments after refusing to listen to Hindi songs -- and the songs do indeed get in the way every single time they come on, but things are smoothened over by the solid character artists populating this film, from the surprisingly effective Purab Kohli to the ever-excellent Kumud Mishra to the businessmen who play Kumar's buddies to the fascinatingly helpless Feryna Wazheir, who plays a Kuwaiti woman hoping to make her escape with the Indians.",9,3,6,22 January 2016
