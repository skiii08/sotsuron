The Incredible Hulk," 2003 Hulk is more incredible than this rubbish
","A new generation of low attention span nerds hated Hulk 2003 because alongside the action, the film had a deep and evolving emotional and philosophical outlook on the world of the Hulk, and all these elitist nerds wanted was a brainless smash a thon, which they readily get in this Hulk, without any depth or interesting characters to speak of - you get what you ask for, just a bunch of silly fight scenes without much else. The emotional connection is lost, and Edward Norton's Hulk looks neither impressive or anything like his comic origins, with the CGI noticeably less impressive than the 2003 monster that was both terrifying, immensely strong, and had an authentic emotional bond to the story. This just one action scene after another, glued together by flimsy plot, that comes across as a hindrance in the film's mission to satiate the juvenile, low attention span nerds who complained. Poor film, not even worthy of 1/10.",1,0,0,7 December 2019
