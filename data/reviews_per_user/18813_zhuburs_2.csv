Requiem for a Dream," just another movie...
","How can it be, that it's rated higher than The Green Mile? That movie is like in a totally different level(higher)! But now back.... I mean, don't you see this kind of crap on the streets and in the news every day? Isn't it enough already? I think that this movie is just for easy money making. It just states the obvious of many American lives(no hard feelings, I mean that). It was boring and predictable. Just once again, somebody showed how stupid people are. Of course, it's sad, but it didn't really give me any big thought to think about so I'm quite disappointed and I only watched it because it was rated high on this site.",Null,0,1,30 May 2004
The Green Mile," wow....
","So far this is the best movie I've ever seen! I just don't get it - where was I earlier? Anyway, the emotions in it are almost too much to handle. The proportions of the reality and the fantasy are perfect cause you don't feel like watching a Sci-Fi movie. I'm a big believer, so for me this movie was perfect cause I believe that in a thousand or whatever big number of years, this could happen. Miracles do happen, although we do live in a time where we only trust our computers and stuff like that. The movie doesn't stop to carry you away till the very last minute of it and that is something which is quiet rare for movies. For the poor people who haven't seen it(hopefully, yet): If you want to see a more than just a perfect movie and a great team of actors, then this is for you!",Null,1,2,30 May 2004
