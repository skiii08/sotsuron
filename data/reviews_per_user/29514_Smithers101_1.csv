Raiders of the Lost Ark," FORD and ALLEN make THE perfect pair in SPIELBERG's masterpiece
","There is nothing more to be said about this great, GREAT movie other than it deserves it crown as THE GREATEST action adventure film of all time. HARRISON FORD and KAREN ALLEN are perfect together. FORD shows all the signs of the boxoffice movie icon he has deservedly become. He is both courageous, gorgeous but human and fallible. ALLEN too has proved to be a popular, prolific and highly respected actress in her own right. She totally defines the word 'spunky' in this film. SPIELBERG and LUCAS really hit the jackpot with this film. A true CLASSIC that will live forever in the hearts of movie fans!!",Null,0,1,24 July 2001
