Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Rubbish
","Well I for one am a big fan of the original 3 films, my favourite being The Empire Strikes Back, but this film was to put it simply ghastly to watch. It's not as if it's the worst film ever made or anything it's just that it lacked all the things needed to make it a good film or even a slightly worthwhile film. The cast included some good actors but their lines were all really dull. The action scenes like the pod race were totally predictable and offered nothing that hasn't been done before. There was no attempt to be original and this sequence along with other parts of the film was like a simple comic book story using way too expensive special effects. The effects themselves weren't even that good, just plain dull. Jar Jar IS as annoying as everyone says he is and the sheer ludicrous disney style of the 'I wonder what this button does, Oh look I've killed all the bad guys and saved the day' part at the end defies all sanity. Lucas has lost it. The worst film of the year.",1,3,6,18 February 2000
