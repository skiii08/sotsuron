The Lobster," Not my cup of tea
","I like movies with characters I can relate to, with suspense, some action, and an interesting plot.
This movie doesn't meet any of those criteria. The characters are unrelatable, the plot is absurd satire, there's some gore and distasteful sexual activity, and once you get the plot device, it becomes pointless. It's true it has dark humor and satire, which I don't find appealing. I will stick to more conventional films.",4,2,3,23 January 2019
Passengers," Exciting, suspenseful sci-fi adventure
","I found this movie extremely enjoyable and will be sure to watch it again. The best part is the ship, a fascinating design, inside and out, that is a character in itself. I love seeing its whirling flight through space.
The plot is gripping and suspenseful. Special effects are excellent: such as what happens to the swimming pool when gravity fails and all the water becomes airborne.
The actors do a great job and are clearly enjoying themselves. Although the ending wasn't what I would have chosen, it was satisfactory.",8,0,1,14 December 2018
Concussion," Important and inspiring movie
","A splendid, uplifting movie, focusing on the scientific intelligence and courage of Dr Omalu, who discovered the effects of concussion on football players, which was named CTE. Will Smith does a great job as the doctor, as enjoyable as his performance in The Pursuit of Happiness.The actress who plays his wife is also excellent. When he wavers in facing the forces trying to silence him, she reminds him his name is Omalu Onyemalukwube: 'if you know, you must come forth and speak.'Supporting actors, including Alec Baldwin, do a good job as well. Highly recommended, and a topic that every parent should be aware of.",8,2,4,1 March 2017
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," excellent movie
","-Much better than I expected. Brilliant photography, great music, acting that captures the real and the goofy of Walter's daydreams. Worth watching many more times. I especially liked Ben Stiller's portrayal of Mitty, and also the surprising Todd, who shows up near the end, the profiler for Match.com -- a real treat.",8,1,1,28 March 2017
Lucy," fun movie with a letdown ending
","I always enjoy watching Scarlett Johansson. And the first 40 minutes of this film were entertaining. But the ending left me cold -- it didn't go far enough. So she enlarges the use of her brain to 100%, manages to revenge herself on the bad guys, killing a bunch of them in the process, and becomes an omnipresent, omniscient, omnipotent being. 'I am everywhere.' Okay, then what do you do with all this power and knowledge? Nothing-- that's the end. I would have really liked to see some sort of philosophy on what the purpose of it all is, and once you acquire power, what should you or could you do with it? She could have terraformed planets and resettled warring tribes there. She could have ended hunger and war somehow. There is a lot she could have done, but we don't even know what she considered worth doing. And I'm really tired of cars driving wrong way down the freeways for endless minutes. Seems like directors just do it because it's fun to create and they can. But we've seen it -- it was done to perfection in Deju Vu. I never need to see it again.",6,0,2,27 February 2015
