Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," At last, it started but...
","If you didn't see the film yet, try to hold on a second as this may include a spoiler.
I watch the three first Star Wars (I mean episodes 4,5,6) when I was a kid, it was fun. Now I'm a little older and I begin to fully understand the plot in the film. I mean what child who watched The Phantom Menace and would have understood all the politics in it. I personally found the film too long, especially what I call the first part (till after the pod race) and only after that I found some interesting thing in the film. The fact that the media told so much about the movie was a total disaster, with a little bit of luck you could have seen the film before it was release thanks (or in case because of) those media. Now some piece of advice for anyone who hasn't seen the film yet, try to watch in English, the dubbing of the film makes it so bad, the voice sound so bad, that you just don't want to see it.If you put aside those considerations, it quite a good film with a lot of special effect and which is worth seeing. Anyway no one is better judge than oneself when its about taste.",Null,0,0,13 October 1999
