Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not perfect, but a fun film none the less.
","Visually speaking, The Phantom Menace is a breath taking film.  There were scenes that triggered my fear of heights,and the CGI characters were some of the best I'd ever seen.  (Though not quite photo realistic. Have to wait for episode three I believe.) The plot is the weak point of this film.  George Lucas doesn't really do a good job of explaining the background.  As a result, the film feels more like the first chapter of a long book, than a complete movie.  If you've read all the comics, and novels, you might understand the background.  That's not good film making, however. Despite the lack of background, Jar Jar Binks, and a major plot loophole at the end, I enjoyed The Phantom Menace.  When the credits rolled, I still wanted more, and to me, that's a sign of a good movie. I would rank it above Return of the Jedi, but below Star Wars, and Empire Strikes Back.",7,0,0,7 April 2000
