Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not worth the hype, but not terrible
","I was just as excited as anyone in the upcoming weeks before the Star Wars prequel. I imagined what the film would be like and was very excited about the prospect of another two Star Wars prequels. But I found that there was something about this film that I personally felt was not completely the same as the original. Yes, the special effects are more advanced, but in the original the story was a lot better. But I did definately enjoy the fight scenes. They were without a doubt the highlight for me. I won't waste your time talking about the character of Jar-Jar Binks, but I will say this . . . What happened to Chewbacca!!! In the original Chewbacca was original, maybe Lucas wanted to duplicate that originality.The acting was good, although the special effects were dominating over that. Natalie Portman was especially good because she really is one of the best young actors of today.But to say the film was terrible wouldn't be fair. There were some things I disagreed with in it and it wasn't as good as the original. But the fight scenes were enough for me to give it 7/10. I can't wait to see what the next two are like.",7,0,0,6 January 2000
