First Man," Been there done that
",This movie did not add anything to the current available historical. Information out there. I great up near NASA Houston and besides the improved cinematography this movie added very little and never had a punch line,5,1,2,11 January 2019
Deadpool 2," It was like a missed sneeze
","Dead pool is one of my favorite movies. The 1st was sooo amazing I could not wait for the 2nd. My biggest critisizim of the 2nd was the timing of the comedy. It went to fast and did not have enough time between gags to appreciate each tidbit of humor. While I was thinking about the the joke they rushed to the next gag so I had to turn my thoughts to focus on not missing the next. It was like having to sneeze and missing it. WTG people's, it's more important to make the movie a little longer (time wise) or writing in time space for the joke to sink in. A missed sneeze is hell on earth",9,2,3,11 January 2019
