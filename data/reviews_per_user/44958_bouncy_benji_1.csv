Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Great film
","I found the film profusely amazing. Characters were portrayed humorously and Borat is sheer brilliance. His unrealised wit and soundness makes him a giant nipper and you could basically sum up the film with this one line: 'i pretty much care loads cheers.' Borat is shown brilliantly with the acting around his showing off the awkward humour. I would like to mention some quotes but am not allowed to. In conclusion, the film is a masterpiece and i would advise all who can to see it. Look past the obscenities and see class! The humour develops throughout the film and gradually becomes more and more funny. Although I feel that the script may have gone slightly too far with the insults on Jews, women, and black people, the film is still generally on the button with its humour.",10,4,26,5 November 2006
