Howl's Moving Castle," Another brilliance of imagination from Hayao Miyazaki
","One thing recognizable about Hayao's works is its uniquely honed story featuring a new overture of imagination; he never fails on that part. Howl's Moving Castle is another living proof of his untiring work of art, a masterpiece to be exact. The Movie intrigued me after seeing Spirited Away and some of Hayao's famous pieces like My Neighbor Totoro, Kiki's Delivery Service, Princess Mononoke, Porco Rosso and Castle in the Sky are just some of his successful works.Howl's moving castle isn't only and ideal imaginative anime one could witness. It is filled with inner depth and story of values one could appreciate. The story begins with Sofie, a young woman who lacks confidence later being cursed by a vindictive witch called 'Witch of the Wasteland', and the only way to repel the curse is to find an unlikely immature young wizard named Howl. One remarkable facet of this animated movie is the upbringing of old chaotic wars into an unimaginable mix of existence of sorcery. The pace of the story doesn't saturate the mood by focusing only to the main characters. There are later revelations and reconciliations that made the story more likable. One good thing about Hayao Miyazaki's mood of story is that it doesn't spoil the movie's story by the usual predictable flow, but it will make one amazed with new twists and atmosphere. And most of all is how the Movie characterized the environment of the story, it rather creates and ecosystem one could appreciate how the movie occurs (well even though it is an animated film).Overall it is an outstanding achievement for Miyazaki, though it didn't win an Oscar, its still worth to collect and admire.",10,0,1,20 December 2008
Kung Fu Panda," A Funny, Hearty Christmas treat I've seen
","This is another proof Dreamworks made the best of their 'Dream-Works' creations. Like Up I saw another hearty treat from them when I lounged myself for a marathon last 2009 Christmas. Kung Fu Panda got all the wits, talents, comedy, excitement and a bit of drama materialized into 3d entertainment. (I loved Martial Arts movies), and from the long years I saw them in real action pace I wondered how exhilarating would it be in 3D (I saw enough in 2D). Unthinkably and funnily it materialized through Dreamworks. Their sincerity and wit mixed in the story made it a modern-classic novelty success. I must say the cast are also brilliant (especially Jack Black). Jack Black's humor got well into the character of Po. The rest are humorously awesome. You'll even forget their playing the one! I mean, I didn't realize for a moment that Monkey was Jackie Chan, and Viper was Lucy Liu. Even Dustin Hoffman's voice as far as I remember (well, most recently I was fond of a lot of his old films!) is unrecognizable. One may think the story excites only kids but it caters anyone who finds entertainment open in their heart. I remember watching 'A Bug's Life'. I've seen it in VHS for almost five times and still didn't get tired of its simple but enticing story. Although it may seem thinly inviting in cover, I assure you its action and play is superbly enough.",10,0,1,9 January 2010
Star Trek," Cool, eventful, envisioned and re-established movie
","I've never been an avid follower of Star Trek nor Star Wars series. But I always remember when I was young how I got fascinated watching the older version of these movies in a defunct VHS format medias. I can't even remember the older version of the only Star Trek movie I've ever watched, but admittedly it was one of the best classic sci-fi films I've ever witnessed. I can tell that Star Trek has to have more lead compared to Star Wars. The latter considerably to be an entertaining film as well but Star Trek has the sharper phase and delightfully different attitude in its story. Forget to mention I didn't quite like much the remake of Star Wars, as how they were visualized and dramatized. I can clearly see the pale dramatization of characters in Star Wars than in Star Trek. This is the only variance I could see between the two. Though they undeniably equal in terms of effects, uniqueness of story and plot they have differences. At any rate, this fresh remake of Star Trek movie had got to be one you need to absolutely see. Chris Pine effectively characterized his role as the son of George Kirk (Chris Hemsworth), and Zachary Quinto had me reminisced a lot of his character as one of those Vulcan habitants. The story was also very much solidly established. I'm impressed how they managed to have such considerably effective paperwork of script to visualize this uncanny, heavy-effect sci-fi film. The crew certainly deserves a worth of a recognition and payroll for such job well done. I was enthralled and thrilled with the joyride of this film. The people, the acting crew had made their roles convincingly well and it is a great deal to be acquainted with their effort-full job. Eric Bana did get a grip of that antagonistic aura of a villain, somewhat confused, vengeful, cruel and honored. I consider this film to be a worthwhile choice of seeing over and over again.",10,4,11,21 November 2009
As Good as It Gets," As good as it was
","There you are the title defines the film itself. I resorted to the thought that I should be seeing a film one of the best actors living nowadays had acted with. I have to site that Jack Nicholson's best performance I've seen so far was since 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'. And I can't help grinning at thought of bringing the remnants of his acting trademarks which I saw in this film. Just creatively witty and this is the first time I saw Helen Hunt! She's just wonderful as well. It's indeed a bit off to imagine a grumpy, OCD writer, a troubled gay neighbor and a caring single mother would join and enjoy the full circle. It was really cool to see Nicholson do the part of bigoted, obsessively compulsive writer. Seeing and hearing Melvin Udall get to his clumsy attitudes amuses me, Nicholson is just cute for the part and he did it nicely. Helen Hunt has a bit of craziness and insensitivity there, but that's her character. The thought of hating it actually pulled through her acting skills. Greg Kinnear was also better. He did agreeably his role and it was splendid. The one impressed the most was the dog. It's funny, but considerably trained dog could have pulled the role. That was innovative. One thing lacking though is the part of Nicholson's character. I wish they could have emphasized more the background of his character's unlikely behavior. It wasn't only OCD that described Melvin's strange attitude but there was something else in there. I was thinking they could have focused on that side more deeply. The scene that struck me, it was only a moment but it was electric for me, was when Melvin was told to return the dog as Simon (Greg) was about to get better and wanted the dog back sooner. At that moment I saw how powerfully Jack Nicholson got into the character's deeply sad side. He was about to lose something that made him feel better. It was as if just the prior thought of it makes it painful for him. He cried! I almost cried seeing that! That was potent! I wish they could have brought a piece of that Melvin's side to Helen Hunt's character. But I realized later, the film went well probably without getting too much on that part. I've learned that a little of something so electrifyingly sensitive and catchy is best shown in seconds and in a single time only. As powerful as Jack Nicholson's performance at One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, this has to be his second most evocative performance. It should be understood that the film was more of a romantic comedy. Well I guess the little dramatic side of it makes it stands out.",9,1,1,10 July 2012
Inglourious Basterds," A war movie? More of a carefully schematic film with sharp plot
","I'm led to believe that this has to be one of the finest articulations Quentin Tarantino dealt with every movie he made. I was surprised he had its story completed for almost a decade. Putting that aside it was more astonishing he had Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill vol. one and two, a collaboration with Robert Rodriguez for a fairly impressive Grindhouse performance, all in process while having this secretly furnished. Well it pays well, because he had the movie an utter success. Others may tell it isn't, but why bother messing with them anyway? The film likewise I've always felt with Quentin's atmospheric trademark always contain something erringly new. The path of the story proves this, but the tone of Quentin's quality is always there. You get into the tension, the excitement and chilling exposition. That I always had the fun for Tarantino's films, and Inglourious Basterds is a living proof for that. To start, the selection of the characters was marvelous. Some I knew (Brad Pitt of course, Daniel Buhrl, Diane Kruger and Eli Roth) while others the first time I saw (such as Melanie Laurent, surprisingly Christoph Waltz and Michael Fassbender who were all brilliant). There were more characters in the film whom I first saw and were entertainingly surprising for their performances. This lead me to Christoph Waltz whose character was so fascinating that you wouldn't wonder if he's acting which fine spaces of black and white. His character, though antagonistic in first impression was interestingly residing in gray area waiting to unfold his real motifs. No surprise he had an Oscar for a nomination, and it is yet to be revealed. This I was always amazed by how cunningly Tarantino embedded in his articulate scripts. It appears however that some viewers see Quentin's long, expressive script as tedious and arduous, fit for some of its part to be labeled as 'unnecessary' and have it removed. One of my friends commented that the film was disgustingly good and detailed but he was bored by the long lines of dialogues. Well I assumed he wasn't the type of a typical movie commenter who sees the value of the story rather than the value of the movie to become mistakenly popular. Objectively, his long script is meant to build the air of the setting, the mood of the particular part of the film. And I believe he was always doing well on this. Inglourious Basterds is another living proof for this. Remarkably other characters that are unpopular or seemingly greenhorn for the role were also reasonably impressive. Take for example the role of Melanie Laurent, Michael Fassbender, August Deihl, Denis Menochet and rarely is Daniel Buhrl. They were convincingly successful in pulling of their role and managed to bring the air of thrill and excitement on screen. Melanie Laurent possessed the shaking fear of a hunted Jew and managed at the same time to entrench her vengeance after them. Michael Fassbender was eloquently entertaining for his role, but sadly I admit he got killed instantly in the film and I wish to see more of him. August Deihl's character as Major Hellstrom was also captivating. I even got to hate his character. A piece of Nazi officer who's rudeness backed by his fidelity of his country's goal had made well his character 'hateable'. Denis Menochet in the beginning also did well, it is implied or left to the viewers what fate awaits him and his family in the film after Colonel Hans Landa (Waltz) did his job there. And it was a long time since I saw Daniel Buhrl's short appearance in Bourne Ultimatum. But I was impressed by his character in a drama, thriller movie in 2006 entitle 'Cargo'. Almost every part of it was good. And I would definitely sit once more in my coarse couch to watch it once more (like I always did with a lot of Tarantino's film). If one put this film as a war movie I would prefer it as sharp, scheming well planted piece of success Quentin had effectively",10,0,7,21 February 2010
Dawn of the Dead," Relentlessly Horrifying!
","Wow it's been a long time since I've watched a real zombie-type horror movie. Dawn of the dead is indeed a smash to everyone's disposition, its bloodcurdling, fast phasing, new-fangled, irrefutably not tedious to watch, and a wallop to the movie industry. I guess I wasn't being too exaggerated with my appraisal, but this is the only movie were I saw zombies could scamper hastily towards their victim. Certainly Zack Snyder is a new innovator of horror flick, Dawn of the dead is entirely disturbing talking about its plot and would leave its viewer to wonder and worry what would happen next (even the resolution keeps me anxious). In our conventional experiences zombies that appear in movies are slow-moving flesh eating undead corpses, but Zack Snyder had changed the attributes into a more completely shocking outcome, but in contrast to George Romero's new hit 'Land of the Dead', Zack Snyder's invention remains on the remnants of zombies' attributesthey do not possess any sorts of intelligence, all they do is a hack a victim and feast on their flesh till nothing is left.On the other hand it bother's me how the characters had passed their anxieties concerning the existence of this undead flesh-eaters, considering that they live in an abandoned mall stuffed with supplies of natural living, it still disturbs me, and all the dead in the world seems to assemble themselves in the said place to out reach their craving for the survivors.If you're a big fan of horror movies, add this immediately to your ghastly collections!",9,0,0,22 April 2007
Shaun of the Dead," Disgusting and entertaining
","I guess I got already inoculated by previous 'zombie' movies I've seen, all of them coated with serious story lines. Some were convincingly magnificent (e.g. Dawn of the Dead), some are slightly stupid (like 28 weeks later), while others where plain stupid but entertaining (such as Land of the Dead). But when it comes to disgust and entertainment, as far as I can remember, Braindead had made laugh almost to death, while the rest of my friends squirmed and screamed in disgust watching it. This is the first time I saw a British film that made this zombie hype excitingly and worthily watchable. Since I saw Simon Pegg first in Hot Fuzz I know he excelled well more enough in Shaun of the Dead. He's performance here is even deeper. His comedic talent isn't saturated to the extent of impairing his dramatic abilities. Nevertheless the film worked well. It was hilariously charming and plain, simple scary. The cast were also awesome, see Kate Ashfield there for example. She's a straightforward, understanding, simple and frank girlfriend of Shaun (Simon Pegg), but just like Ed, Diane, David and the rest of the cast swayed me with their offhand and persuading performances. The comedy and bit of drama was cool. It mixed well how the story of the film progressed, very much anticipating. But if I were to compare its cheesy factor of horror zombie flick familiarity I guess Braindead was cheesier in that term. But the rest was cool and brilliant. I deem it's cooler than the latter. I've watched this film few times and I get to love the character more and more. It never wears out for my taste.",10,1,3,15 March 2010
Hot Fuzz," An overall fresh comedy coating the mystery...
","I've been wondering if there are few decent British films being comedic but full-packed, there are lots. Hot Fuzz to begin with is seriously entertaining. I thought that its sharp, fast-paced, eccentric movie style is a turn-down but no, it made me curious. Getting puzzled I was fascinated how they sheathed the whole story with mystery, revelation and evenhanded action, comedy and a little bit of drama. Simon Pegg brought well his character. I've used to stereotyping him as only fit for comedic roles, but the moment I saw his scene with Nick Frost near the end, I thought 'This guy is pretty convincing'. He can act well, the way his job demands. Speaking of Nick Frost he was always funny. He was deliberately suitable to play his role. Pegg and Frost's combination is really laughable. I was also surprised that Jim Broadbent appeared in this film, he played well his character. It's not ennui to watch this film over and over again. Edgar Wright's brilliance in pulling all together in this film made it always fresh from the oven. Though there were similarities with his recent Shaun of the Dead (which admittedly was the best) Hot Fuzz nevertheless was way cool in comedy and story. Entertainment unexhausted I believe I strongly recommend seeing this film to anyone delighted with its comical wittiness in action, comedy and mystery.",10,0,0,10 March 2010
500 Days of Summer," An 'un-boasting', hilariously packed, heart warming and riveting romance comedy!
","Few of the things I loved about the movie, well to start with were the characters, I mean the actors. The two lead performers: Joseph Gordon-Levitt—whom I saw in a psychologically captivating drama 'Mysterious Skin', where he really brilliantly exhumed an unlikely role which perfectly projected what the film meant truly. Zooey Deschanel, well this is the first time I saw her, but I've been anticipating watching her movie together with Aaron Stanford in their comedic duo Flakes (Aaron Stanford's films were always friggin rare to get!), had performed very well her witty role. When I was observing how Gordon-Levitt pulled his performance, I got to say this man has a hell of a talent. His acting has something rarely brilliant in it that you want to sit still on your couch how this man could trigger the interesting feat, but well talking about his acting is another long story. Zooey Deschanel was incredibly funny too. I never imagined how she 'unconsciously-convincingly' deliver her lines were you get to analyze its funny, though her character never meant it to be that way. I was entranced how the movie progressed, very interesting admittedly. There may be flaws but I hardly notice them anyway, getting entertained about the story and thickness of the plot is what's important. All in all this isn't at all an average romantic comedy you would lovely share with your partner, friends or family. It's really worthwhile. It's simple and complicatedly brilliant in its own way. Rather than indulging with highly-budgeted, misinterpreted romantic comedy films out there, it's a penny worth to see this, trust me.",10,0,1,30 March 2010
Resident Evil: Extinction," Substance exhilaration reduced
","Everyone was excited to see how well the third installment of Paul W.S. Anderson's (writer) Resident Evil will flaunt in theater's. I was as well anticipating seeing the movie in theater's as usual but decided to wait for it at original copies or clear, legal ripped movie on the net. Finally watching the film, I wasn't at all intensified with the flicks and twists it presented me for the first thirty minutes. Disappointing, to partially express a view for this, the third installment of Resident Evil wasn't that eye-catching, I guess the plot and acting didn't fit in, the story was quite lame to convince real scenery of an almost extinct post-apocalyptic world. The action scenes were also not that creative, but least to say so Milla Jovovich manage to preserve her character as isthe only gruesome I could acceptably identify were four: zombies ,dead K9s, infected crows and oh the sudden mutation of Dr. Isaac whom he consider himself the future he was always seeking rather than Alice herself. I also felt pity for those untimely sacrifices some characters gone, except for Carlos Oliveraand I knew that he and Alice had 'something', I was glad but unsatisfied.Least to say so, it was still a considerable Resident Evil film sequel to follow what happened thereafter and apocalyptic disaster. But for me I appreciate the first two installments as more compelling. In this movie, I didn't felt the chills I usually had with the first two ones.",6,1,3,12 September 2008
Cloverfield," Impressively nice film...
","At first I thought the movie would be a hell of a crap, but then I learn to be patient likewise to see if the movie is really a worth. Basically the style of the film was fascinatingly cool, the innovation created is a piece of eye-catching flick from the moment you start to watch the film. Although I believe some where vexed with the fashion of the movie, but they sure do doesn't know how to appreciate an impressively imaginative film. Primarily I have no complete idea of what would be the central cause of the stories major conflict, it was indeed exciting and makes you sit still on your couch and expect the unexpected. But to be honest, I thought of it as a frequent bunch of maturely adult friendship story that focuses on their self issues and try to narrowly solve a relationship coma, and then suddenly an outbreak of unexplainable war-like-fare boomed out of the blue causing awe and panic all over Manhattan. Later, however we come to understand the causes and main point of the story, thus I sparingly conceive what the tag line says 'something has found us', then a huge monster appear in a blur from devastated store's tvs stormed by petty thieves out for their own egotistical interests.Then the impact from our faces? Trepidation and astonishment, as is. Then the story goes on, its not boring and I would admit I appreciated so much the film from its skin and core. Deserves a ten.",10,1,2,16 April 2008
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," The best of Paul Newman-Robert Redford duo!
","Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid had got to be the coolest western crime movie I ever seen in 60s. It got the wits, the crime, the drama and adventure! Paul Newman and Robert Redford were equally the best in their roles. Though honestly 'The Sting' was incontestably very good as well, this film out reigns the latter for me. Katharine Ross, which appeared later wasn't bad as well. The most captivating was of course the story. However the story wasn't materialized well to its depths if Paul Newman and Robert Redford, two legendary actors had pulled the trick. They were really good in portraying the characters. And to convince you, the real sister of Butch Cassidy (in real life) appreciated well how Paul Newman played the character well. Robert Redford on the other hand was superbly brilliant and cool as well. This is the first movie I saw him playing western. Butch had the brains, Sundance got the action. They mixed well and we see a great movie. Most of the time being enthralled, I got most of the laughs the comedy the two naturally performed. Very good film.",10,0,1,4 November 2009
Pan's Labyrinth," Eerily captivating
","Guillermo Del Toro had definitely made this film a unique deal! Pan's Labyrinth has to be one of the newest treat of our times. Though admittedly the actors and actresses didn't compellingly excel much with their roles, the story was nevertheless full of substance and depth. I believe that the acting wasn't terrible, it fairly fit the storyline. And they excelled well in special effects, cinematography and art, which balances well the structure of the story as a whole. The uniqueness of the story has also something to do why it is undeniably captivating. We were used to children fantasy stories filled with immense fictitious characters, places and most of all happy endings. Though in history some of these historical children fantasy tales had depressing portions of the story, the cliché is that it ended happily ever after. However this film is an exception. I can't even believe that everything about the story where pulled out of Guillermo Del Toro's imaginative mind. To tell story in the end was saddening. I didn't end happily well, as what majority of us would expect. This isn't really a new treat for most films. But for this filmin this area of genre it is brilliantly portrayed. The depth of the words, the poetic structure of the narration got me enthralled, and I would say this is undoubtedly a magnificent film. It's dark, magical, sad but eerily captivating.",10,2,10,4 November 2009
The Godfather: Part II," Brilliantly excellent sequel
","Some bickered that Godfather 2 was an insult to be called a sequel, but I don't mind them arguing such. Admittedly I watched the film first before Godfather 1 and was astounded with its beauty even after I watched Godfather 1. I realized well after watching Godfather 2 how the character of Al Pacino as Michael Corleone developed well throughout the film, and I quite grasped as well very well his character after I watched Godfather 1. The film was double layered. Viewers would understand in this film Vito Corleone's origin, how he grew and feared by many. On the other hand shows the present son of Vito: Michael, who is struggling to deal with his father's family business left to him. The characters and atmosphere were simply superb, and you could understand well how the story progresses. How Michael got the similarity of the situation he is experiencing as contrast to his father during the early times. We see Vito Corleone 's life progresses during his early years, and we see Michael, being the youngest of the family, adhere to his father's legacy and lived through defending his family and business. We can see how well the father and son got their similarity of managing their business and tried well not to mix family in it. I was so touched in Godfather 1 concerning Michael's affection to his family, most especially to his father. And I was moved with his affection towards his family now in Godfather 2 after his father died how he held on what was dearly important to him. I got the bleak understanding how crime worlds works except since after I watched Godfather 1. Italian countrymen got their pride, their history, their nature, and Mario Puzo had brilliantly depicted a beautiful story out of it. Funny though after I watched the film I didn't even realized that it was Robert De Niro who plays the part of the early Vito Corleone, how mesmerizing.",10,1,3,9 September 2009
The Bourne Ultimatum," The Best sequel (probably the finale) ever
","This got to be more of unexpected turn of events! I couldn't believe how much the Bourne Trilogy upgraded so much. From Identity to Supremacy, and now the Ultimatum, this got to be one heck of work for them. The third installment was certainly the best improvement among the Bourne movie series. This was as if 'the best for the last' and the crew behind really worked hard for the success of the movie, no wonder it got to top 135 for this site and garnered an ample vote to appraise its brilliance. Bourne Ultimatum indeed was an awestruck for me, I've never fathom how much Paul Greengrass had heaved this movie much, not only to popularity but for a prompt qualification on Oscars as it deserves. I agree that new 007 Bond movie(s) need to be aware of such rapid elevation for Bourne movies. After Bourne sorted few more things and retraced his steps gradually at the second installment he come to terms of finishing what started Treadstone and put an end to a more upgraded version of this program: Blackbriar. Though he got no idea who where the people behind, he sure was decided to put an end to what he believed started with him. Bourne Ultimatum has more of reasonable brilliance than the rest of the Bourne Movie, more conspiracy, action and new characters. Its substance and form blend almost perfectly and its sheets of surprises which adequately complements the luster of the movie. The conclusion was also fitting, it was cool and satisfying and I deem never leave viewers befuddled with sequels, well if it does have one I bet they could pull a much more neat trick to outwit the recent one.",10,1,2,30 October 2008
Léon: The Professional," Dramatically thrilling
","I bet for a moment when I watched this movie from the start that it was something uninterestingly tedious. But I was wrong. The movie shows a life a professional assassin, doing his work simple but proficiently done. A mix of drama, thrill and action, I've even cried a bit in the end. This was also the movie I first saw Natalie Portman still in her youngster years, Jean Leno was fittingly appropriate for the role, and Gary Oldman was a perfect choice for an unlikely antagonist. I admit the movie was bloody, every rising climatic portion of the story always keeps my blood running through my veins oddly, and I appreciate that. The story wasn't senselessof course, everyone loved the plot of the film, my father even had his concurring comments for this movie.Indeed the rating of IMDb users shows this movie a worth watching, real, breathtaking, heartrending and undeniably touching.",10,1,4,29 August 2007
The Bourne Identity," A nice clean beginning
","Bourne Identity has got to be one of the most excitingly gripping movies I've ever seen. Though I've never been a top fan of extremely plain action movies, this one has got to be an exception. Bourne Identity as played by a rising brilliant actor Matt Damon, who played Jason Bourne, an extremely trained assassin, whose affiliation is a clandestine even among CIA offices. The story begins with Jason Bourne (Matt Damon of course) whom he abandoned a mission due to unexpected psychological disturbances in his brain, however his desertion lead to his life's danger, as his target manage to kill him instead, but he narrowly escaped. As the story progresses, we learn how Jason came into being and went to search for pieces of his past. Those who manage Treadstone (a secret operative section of CIA where Jason Bourne belongs) manage to track him down for two slightly unsure reasons: one to hold him custody and bring him into questioning about his failure to complete his recent mission, or second to eliminate him because of the threat he brought, which was tantamount to their suspicion of Bourne betraying them for he recently abandoned a mission.I must admit that this movie is one decent project, and I never expect Matt Damon to excel very well and appear to perfectly fit the character of Jason Bourne. Superb certainly, for his uncanny character makes the story successful and effectively eye-catching for action-connoisseur viewers. This indeed deserve a neat sequel.",10,2,2,30 October 2008
Little Miss Sunshine," Splendid slice of life film
","Since I saw Abigail Breslin shine in one of her movies (independent ones, specifically) titled 'Keane' together with an exceptionally fine actor Damian Lewis, I've been anticipating her to boost her talent and professionalism in acting field to the best. Little Miss Sunshine, deep in my heart, is superbly a best choice for a movie connoisseur. It is indeed a Slice of Life movie, with absolutely no slow-phase moving story plot, haughty scenes and nostalgic-to-boring expositions. I love its imperceptible but convincing atmosphere, likable characters (cast of Abigail Breslin herself, Greg Kinnear, Paul Dano, Alan Arkin, Toni Collete and the funny but serious, solid role of Steve Carell), exciting phases of the movie and versatile story that doesn't saturate the whole film just by focusing on the main character of the story. In accordance with the recent remark I gave about the movie, it doesn't only focus on the main characterOlive, but along their wacky, fun, dramatic, and riveting journey a lot of the things begin to surface, each member of the bus begins to realize their own identities and tendencies. Olive's grandfather (played by Alan Arkin as Edwin) succumbs of being drug-user, but never renounces his support and love for her grand-daughter. There's also Frank Ginsberg(Sheryl Hoover's gay brother, mother of Olive, played by Toni Collete) who was recently discharged by the hospital for almost killing himself due to a devastating relationship and job conflicts, however he was as well one of the people who Olive enthusiasm had touched. Sheryl, her mother, and Richard (played by Greg Kinnear) got their own issues as well, whining and fighting over each other's inefficiencies and inaccurate decisions but decided to cool off for their daughter's unfailing dream. Lastly was Dwayne (played by) whose unwillingness and hostile aura decides to hate everyone but deep inside love his entire family.The film for me is a mix of blending feelings. At portions of the movie, you tend to be excited, then thrilled, then emotionally moved and begin to unnoticeably fill your eyes with cries then there's also laughter, resentment, shame, above all this film certainly a best preference to spend a worthwhile moment.",10,1,2,8 September 2008
The Intouchables," Just Brilliant
","It's been a while since I wrote a comment for a movie. I rarely find the luxury of time praising a well crafted movie that doesn't give a damn of any social issues. And it's totally rare for me to have the lucky chance finding a foreign movie that doesn't need to tell its masterpiece beauty. First of all, all the time I was watching the movie I thought I was staring at Dustin Hoffman playing well a disabled nobleman being taken care of by a straight-thinking commoner. I know the overreacted dire issues this movie is being pestered, but I don't really care what other people say how the movie should have been. It's an obvious sign already that this movie topped 111 (and may still elevate) in IMDb top 250 movies that a lot of sensible reviewers appreciated its simplicity. The reason indeed probably why the crew casted a black man instead of Arabian to portray the character because maybe simply Omar Sy just had the skill to fit in to the character's delicate vessel. Why so locked with the racism issue? Other may had been suggestive but it's not an extreme case to horribly condemn the movie of its simple choice. I just don't understand people who can't keep their bloody mind open. Well either way the movie had its story straightforwardly rendered and its worth approving rather than condemning. I even laughed so hard when Driss (Omar) just naturally cackled all over the man dressed like a tree singing at the top of his voice, man that was really a humorous punch. The drama Well done.Ten stars would be more than it deserved.",10,9,15,28 April 2012
American History X," Unbelievable
","I'm always impressed how cool Edward Norton carry his character in every film his in. This one has to be one of his most deserving performance to receive an award. Certainly one of the few comments I've read, you got hauled into his character. And indeed it proved true. Edward Norton's character has a very captivating aura. In the first place we see him a complete racist freak, who's blinded so much with hatred and rage. Then we see him gradually cools down (when he got in jail). And we finally see a complete shift of his character from a cruel racist to a peaceful friendly man who doesn't care what's your color. Edward Norton had performed this character really well, and I mean truly well. You can feel the imbibed hatred and rage in his heart when he condemns and spit off the existence of blacks in their country. He even had gone to his limits (even hurting his family, blinded by rage), and this gave me the chills! Made me even squirm in my seat! Especially when I saw him so mad in a meal discussion throwing off their viewpoints concerning blacks and other foreign immigrants of their country of who's got the right and who's out. His younger brother in the film, like anyone else idolizes his brother and we see throughout as well how he transformed. I love the structure of the story. The film doesn't only give me the reason to like it because of the actors' ability to portray their role. The story has something in reality, very genuine and sublime. The actions and sequence where also convincing. The drama had all to get you hanging in and staying at your seats. Unquestionably it is one of the best film to portray existent situations in a country. Very moving, very inspiring, unbelievably brilliant.",10,0,6,4 November 2009
Twilight," Nice but a little jumpy
","The impact of Twilight was certainly a new crave for movie lovers, it attracts foremost, according to my observation the interest of most teenagers. It just suddenly sprang from nowhere; I don't even know anything about the book, considering it just came out in the market in year 2006 (New Moon), I wasn't even aware of a brilliant book to emerge unexpectedly! Stephenie Meyer had indeed the speed and genuine fashion to shape a mythical subject into a new enthralling flick. Talking about the movie, the cast was brilliant, they indeed portrayed the characters as they are, the atmosphere and mood of the story was well defined, and however the flaw of the movies was about the story itself. I've heard that the script was too distorted compared to the book, and as I observed the movie the flow of the plot was rather 'jumpy' I couldn't tell exactly where the story goes, especially when you slip a moment of talking to your friends and suddenly you find the movie in a different phase already. I could tell this that most watchers would find it hard to cling to the story's (most especially when you're not a reader of the book) character, I could even catch people around the cinema muttering 'Who's Victoria?', 'Did she became a Vampire already?' realizing this things around I doubt that the movie was a total hit. But in totality I was amused how they manage this film to come out of life, it was honestly beautiful and cool. I got dazed with the movement of the story, so probably I would prefer to pore over the books.7 out of then wouldn't be bad",7,0,2,30 November 2008
The Chorus," Greatly stirring foreign film
","Its really interesting watching film that were foreign. You don't have to understand their language at all, provided by subtitles. However what you would truly appreciate with most of them is their earthly brilliant stories you would never expect to see. Les Choristes, simply 'The Choir' brought me interest and joy in seeing another wonderful film of all times. Truthfully the film didn't get too tight in improving the mood of the story. The atmosphere, the characters, the background musics, effects and the rest of the film were carefully made presentable and good. The characters are also justly comprehensible. Clement Mathieu (Gerard Jugnot) had incredibly brought into stage a character the situation deems impossible to materialize. He became the teacher he had to be in the story and his character is firm enough to portray it till the end. Rachin (Francois Berleand), the principal (His face is really familiar) also had the character, which I describe as swift, sharp and annoying but you would consider interesting as well. I got the moment when I find his character shifting, but got failed to expect he would change because it is in his nature of being so stone-hearted. You would hate or despise him but nevertheless that's what got you into hating his character, his capability to capture our attention is one truly appreciable aspect he had. There were also other characters you deem fit with their roles, good and reasonable such as Chabert (Kad Merad), Monsieur Langlois (Philip Du Janerand), La Pere Maxence (Jean-Paul Bonnaire), Violette Morhange (Marie Bunel), and of course the rest of the children. I didn't solely love the story, the beauty of the atmosphere and the background music also made chills and goosebumps for me. Wonderfully this foreign film is truly worth cherishing. I worth of a deal watching more than once or twice.",10,0,0,29 October 2009
The Pianist," A similar ground in different sides...
","Had to be top achievement of Adrien Brody, and I never doubt the pinnacle of his performance for this. Set again the old ages of the 20th century this film made me recall Steven Spielberg's 'Schindler's List' ringing in my head. It was as heartrending, fearful, expressive and disastrous as the characters of Spielberg's film experienced, though in a different view of course. This film again showed us the misery of innocent people experienced in the hands of vile Germany. But then it left me a room to think in my head that not everything of Germany is as vile as the mainstream thinks. It's the same lesson I picked when watching Schindler's List. And the suffering of the protagonist opened once more parts of life you never thought would happen to anyone. And there are so many things you would never thought of letting go or letting it happen before your eyes and conscience. Such burden and misfortune one has to carry just to survive, Adrien's character lived up to that. We saw it, the struggle and transformation. It was the beauty this film carried, no wonder that for me an Oscar is not ample enough to appreciate the brilliance of human experience excellently told to the mass.Funny it is when my brother's girlfriend recommended me this film and after watching it, I can't get over it. I was even impressed to myself when I shared it to my officemate that she told me how vivid my recollections where. I can't explain it, but probably because of my craving for a beautiful story made me grasp the film in just one go. Just like 'Joyeux Noel' an opposite of this film, though with same worldly issues and situations, strengthened my attachment to them.There so much to tell about this film and I'm really looking forward for the book the film is based. There so much of the detail probably I've missed but the film is brilliant enough to compress those in my opinion.",10,1,1,28 June 2012
P.S. I Love You," An average date movie, very mistaken.
","I've been a fan of Gerard Butler in chains of movies that showed his talent and it was recently a surprise for me to found out that he made a project with Hilary Swank featuring a date movie of romance and comedy genre. However the reviews I thought so convincing and very much true to depict what the movie was really about. A lot of people says that it was instead a dramatic love story rather than a romantic comedy, they were wrong, and others also shared that it was a tear-jerker movie since after the advent of 'The Notebook'and exactly they were wrong again. My anticipation for this film was half-thwarted. I thought that it was a movie that would sincerely pinch my heart and make my eyes go tear-falling unnoticed but I was wrong, truly this film is half-disappointing. It was mostly drenched with tedious conversations, which had bored me most for the first 30 minutes then the next 30 then another next 30it seems that the remarks of people concerning this film was so overstated or exaggerated, and they dare to compare it with 'The Notebook'? please give me a break! It did not even moved my heart and my feelings to feel for a moment Holly's despair and resentment over her husband's death, but honestly a littleabout that scene where Holly keeps on calling Gerry's cellphone until she fell asleep, that was a vestige of a good drama flick. But when the movie progresses it wasn't at all that 'progressing'. It saddened me that, Gerard Butler, whom according to my findings wanted to call him Gerry instead of Gerard due to pronunciation conflicts, and whom I loved so much for his excellent acting career and real life achievements, was ineffectively utilized in this film. I believe I'm not the only one alone with this estimation, but to compensate it was still a capably nice average date movie.",6,1,2,8 September 2008
Stardust," A story full of wonderfully illustrated imagination and wits
","Stardust had to be one of the films I watched that always reminded me of Lord of The Rings, C.S Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia, Eragon and other films. The dress, the atmosphere, the characters has the similarities; similarities which I tell in a sub-toned way. The film for me is another brilliant depiction of a novel (Which I honestly say I haven't read yet). To be guided, they always made the film easy to follow if one hasn't read the book yet, and they were successful on it. Stardust's story was easy to follow, but of course the history and other relative accounts how the world existed, how things get so magical, what is that and how is that questions can be explained by the book. I was also struck that Peter O' Toole, Ben Barnes, Mark Strong was in this film! I didn't even recognize Robert De Niro was that transvestite captain Shakespeare! And Ian Mckellen was narrating all the time! I got the laughs all the time. I would love to read the book as they say it was darker, graphic and detailed. The movie adaptation was lightheartedly fine for me. It was nevertheless successful and beautiful. I can see well how wonderfully the story was illustrated.",9,1,2,4 November 2009
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs," Ordinary Fun
","I've been always impressed how animated films spent their bucks and efforts having those fingertips work and mind squeezed with ideas that would induce viewers to new level of sensation. Since I saw recently Up, Kung Fu Panda, Ratatouille, Wall-E and Bolt, I got fascinated how animated films nowadays revolutionize compared to early ones (such us Finding Nemo, A Bugs Life, Shark's Tale and more). Films such as these are at the outset, being fit for anyone of any age. Too much with the intro the film is full of creativity. However I guess the original creativity wasn't materialized with such extent when it was materialized into an animated film. The storyline was thin, easily understandable but the characters were somewhat fascinatingly mediocre. I don't find it absolutely amusing how the characters developed and interact with each one. Take the case of Lock Flintwood with other characters such as the police guy, the weather girl and his father. It seems his existence is a joke, but I guess anyone watching this wouldn't feel that deeply because the film in the first place is meant to be like this. At any rate probably my mood wasn't at full scale to appreciate the film well. Nevertheless their creativity was fun and considerably ingenious. You got to see giant pancakes whalloping the whole school topped with butter and drizzled with syrup. The characters also just funnily, whimsically or unimaginably coast through the scene with less regard to how they actually did it. Like Flintwood for example, hopping and flying unscathed when he got sucked in the spaghetti whirlwind. But you wouldn't bother anyway how he did that, because this is in the first place an animated film not meant to crush reality just to flaunt entertainment. But I guess the film fails to clearly deliver its inner layer of lessons and values (to children specially) even to adults (because the rest of the film, I believe disinterests them to appreciate what the film is all about, you get amused by the food, the characters' odd characters). The bottom line its totally ordinary fun.",7,0,3,7 February 2010
Garden State," Calming your state of mind
","I never watched another simple, romantic comedy, drama film for a time. This film has been lying around me for a time until I knew that Natalie Portman was in it, considering as well its high rating here in IMDb, I gave it a try. Surprisingly I didn't find it boring, to be exact it was a beauty! The characters were simple and understandable in their way, and I accepted the structure of the story to be firm and brilliant. The romance and drama from the beginning was evident and implied though not explicitly portrayed yet. The comedy was indeed fun. I love the wits the characters had shown. For a few moments of having great movie marathon this simple movie had calmed my mind for a moment. The comedy gave me that. This film is truly worth time of watching and I love to watch it few more times, the laughs it gave me never failed. Natalie Portman to be true was very natural with her acting capabilities. I didn't even knew, while watching the whole film that Zach Braff was the director and the main character! This guy is talented! Cool thing he grasped the attitude of the character and was fine to go. It's tedious appearance in the first place is completely misleading, but don't think of it. Watch the movie and get hooked. Its cool and beautiful. Not only that its comedy is refreshing but I truly appreciate the beauty of the story",10,0,1,29 October 2009
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Excitingly newer than that its predecessors
","Funny to tell that I've first reviewed Half-Blood Prince than this one. Order of The Phoenix, as it is generally regarded as the thickest book of J.K. Rowling had much to be shown on scree. I've even thought before it came that probably Goblet of Fire has more twists and story. Equally however Order of the Phoenix simply stood than the latter because of its more enthralling and bewildering revelations. The filmmakers did well honestly with the book. But of course there is this clause that 'Everything in the book aren't entirely visualized in a motion picture'. But this what made the consecutive Harry Potter film solid in the film industry. Order of the Phoenix has to be a fatty revelation. The latter books of course would be considered to be 'fattier'. As a distinguishing but similarly striking quality of the film, Order of the Phoenix possessed this darkish aura which I felt evidently since the Prisoner of Azkaban. The third film was my favorite and seeing this fifth installment gave me new excitement and merited expectations on how J.K. Rowling's remarkable creations materialized on screen. I loved the film's dark air which complemented well how the story progressed. The duel scene at the near end was also spectacular. Since I saw Harry's first encounter with Voldermort, slew a Basilisk, fought Dementors, join the Triwizard tournament and now created an army of his own to fight alongside Dumbledores loyal supporters. Likewise the characters of the film are understandable and the actors playing them are reasonable how they acted their character well. One more thing lovable about the film is you see the characters alongside the actors to grew together. I've felt this evidently since The Godfather. A success to David Yates guiding the accomplishment of this fifth film.",9,0,1,7 December 2009
Annie Hall," The first of Woody Allen's excellence that made Diane so naturally refined...
","I remember watching '500 Days of Summer' and commented how good, typical the story was. I posted some recollections watching the film here in IMDb and I recall one user commented 'watch Annie Hall'. Ironically I had the film before '500 Days of Summer' and the irony is that I first saw the latter than the former being owned first than the latter, so that's ironically confusing. Anyway I had Annie Hall before because I heard it was Diane Keaton's award winning film. After watching this film I never thought of smiling and recollecting most of the best scenes in the movie. While washing dishes it made me smile unknowingly how I recall they played tennis, quarrel over killing two spiders the size of a Buick, horribly driving a Beetle, toyed over scattered lobsters, and broke up and make it up. Seriously, Woody Allen had to be one of the brightest mind I've ever saw, no wonder he fished three Oscars for that brilliant talent! This is his second film I saw since 'Whatever Works', though it should be noted that Annie Hall preceded it, well I'm a modern guy, I saw nowadays before classics, that's pretty normal. And Diane struck me like ever. She's so much better in this film, not only I saw her dashing archetypal beauty but her acting skills were so natural and refined. She indeed deserved the Oscar.I thought I would go weary watching films after 10 hours in the office, but I had the accidental choices I never thought would bring so much as an 'accident'. It's very straightforward, sentimental, cute, funny and unarguably worthwhile.",10,0,0,28 June 2012
The Descent," The best of frequent but new-fangled horror movies.
","I'm blown away from the time I saw this movie. The story were genuine, the scare tool were authentically simple but way frighteningchilling you to your bones, and most of all is the mix of genre the story contains. The most profound shock gizmo of this movie was about surprises, I've been astonished a lot about the scenethe accidents, the sudden emergence of this 'crawlers' and the unlikely interesting ending. The characters (especially Shauna McDonald and Natalie Mendoza were great) were excellent in playing their role, they really withholds the requirement of the story's atmosphere, the scare, the panic, the misunderstanding and more.I highly recommend this movie for horror connoisseurs, who are opt to simple but rich, not crap movies A 10/10 rate.",10,2,4,13 August 2007
The Fountain," Mystifyingly puzzling-to-boring
","OK to be honest I really don't like the film, being a Hugh Jackman fan, I been eager to watch every movie of him that comes out the film industry. Having my past encounter with the flowery reviews of Fountain here in IMDb.com my world in viewing this film turned incontestably up side down. No wonder I tried patiently to understand what the film is trying to convey to its viewers, but I got a hard time to discover its bewildering plotÂ—that eventually stayed to be a puzzle till the end, a complete mystery! Yeah it talks about the expression through artistic presentation the means here in the actual life, however I hate abstract presentation that would totally twist my brain nerves and finally would give me an intense headache. I would not want to be presumptuous to like the movie at all, I love Hugh Jackman all the time, he is a good pair for Rachel Weisz as well, I guess so the nature of the movie have inverted my taste in giving extravagant criticism. I like the simplicity of every character's gear and the setting seems to apply as well of its aesthetic moods. However the shift of the story continue to bother me and baffled my mind eternallyÂ—there was one moment were I thought the movie already ended but I didn't left my seat earlier because my attention was caught by the upcoming movie trailers, and after watching the movie trailers a part of the movie suddenly appears and started whole over again with another perplexing plotÂ…phew! Even this moment writing my commentary bores me as wellÂ…how tedious.I could get a better understanding of the movie if I could seize an original copy in a right cheaper price, hoping I could entrust myself to what the film is really trying to expressÂ—or maybe forget it anyway.",2,2,6,22 April 2007
The Bourne Supremacy," Unexpected!!!
","I knew that a Bourne sequel would deserve its predecessor, and here it is! I knew how well the preceding Bourne movie had worked well, and this oneis indeed a pretty decent movieit is way more decent, it's spectacularly far better than the preceding one. This is so much unexpected indeed for most sequel-prone movies, where the crew behind usually lose their talent to infuse more creative layer for sequels, but this one is totally different! I never expect how well they manage to elevate the quality and standing of the movie. Bourne Supremacy continues with Jason Bourne, after quite sorting out things in his past in the first movie he come to live in peace with her girlfriend (whom he met throughout his retracing journey in Bourne Identity) Marie Kreutz (Franka Potente) in India. However some of those use to poison CIA by letting an ambushed operation of them, manage to let Jason Bourne's identity held responsible thus endangering his life (and his girlfriend as well) once again. The first few minutes of the movie was indeed a mix of thrill, resentment and lament, but when it continues so are our surprises continues as well. Paul Greengrass has indeed a lot of aptitude to heave this movie into an exceptionally brilliant movie.",10,4,6,30 October 2008
Princess Mononoke," Seen it, and it wasn't disappointingit was rather EXCELLENT.
","Hayao Miyazaki's project never failed my excitement. He is totally different in the conventional art of 2d animation filled with so much story and detail. Though simple, it's packed with innovativeness and imagination. No wonder he deserves recognition and glory for his works. Mononoke-hime certainly warrants being included in top 250 of this site. The animated film, tells another enchanting story of forest gods co-existing with humans, and their conflicts with each other rising and remained unsettled. The main character in the name of Ashitaka (Yoji Matsuda), the boy residing in a village, who serves as a scout to watch for his village became the starting point of the story. Later the plot progresses into something complicated but nevertheless understandable in long run. I would admit that I'm being led to the idea that San (Yuriko Ishida) appears to be the antagonist, but revelations poured gradually all throughout the film.What's good about Hayao Miyazaki's project for Mononoke-hime as a successful animated film was he's unfailing creativeness and focus on the detail of the entire atmosphere of his story. The characters; both protagonist and antagonists, supporting characters, extra characters, the tree, the grasses, the sky, rocks, both living and non-living thing are given detail that doesn't only make their presence in the film subtle but significant and typical in their respective character. Unlike other frequent animations that only concentrate within the central characters moving and chatting and whatever they are doing. In this movie however, Miyazaki once again preserve the beauty of his work. What more I loved about this film is that it is not only filled with action, revelations, fantasy and creativeness, but along this primary qualities of a good film Hayao never fails to incorporate values and virtues on his stories. No matter how unbelievably unconvincing the nature of the film, he manage to create a system of the story on how characters reacts, acts and plays throughout. This deserves a perfect ten again.",10,0,1,27 December 2008
The Godfather," Excellent
","Being a youth (but I would safely consider myself now as an adult), I never get into much witnessing adult stories. I now realize that most of them are undoubtedly beautiful stories. Haven't read yet prior to the film Mario Puzo's novel, I pulled my guts to watch the film and did my best to understand the story as much as I do with other good-storied films. Godfather 1 had indeed made me witness another beautiful story of different origin. I never imagined how many beautiful stories would still be lingering out there, of every nature, of any environment or of any country it originates. Watching the film, starts with Marlon Brando playing the role of Don Vito Corleone, known as well as the 'Godfather'. I didn't quite understand really the way how crime worlds work, but to me I get the opportunity to understand dealing business with wits and cunning as how you deal practically with your teacher in school. The situation is different, but manner of dealing them is nonetheless similar. I appreciated well the film for Italian's value of family, relationship and trust. How Don Vito Corleone manage to deal business mixing trust and respect differently. How he mends and considers things equally and with weight. This is the first time I observed for the first time Al Pacino grasping a character filled with composure and serenity, and maintained such equanimity after tides turned inevitable to him in the story. I had to admit it is one of the excellent films I've watch so far. The characters, the setting, the environment, the story itself is so genuine and good that you couldn't deny it as a considerably first-rate film.",10,1,1,9 September 2009
