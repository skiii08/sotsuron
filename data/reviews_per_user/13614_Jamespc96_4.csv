Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Nostalgia or Actually Bad?
","Everybody that hates on this film always cites their reasoning as someone that grew up with the originals. But have we not heard the one that grew up on Episode I? (And IV, V, and VI) No they only liked it because they didn't know any better! They were kids they were stupid! It had no storyline! Granted, I have seen Red Letter Media and many others and I actually agree with their points. But there's one thing I would like to say to them. Episode I influenced me to be a writer. It can be told as a short story actually. I would run around with my toy lightsaber pretending to beat up battle droids and my mother would ask me, 'Jimmy, do you want to be a Jedi when you grow up?' and I said, 'No, Mommy, I want to be the guy that writes the stories.' I'd learn new things and words from my mother explaining what was going on. The simple beginning where they just dash through the droids, the pod race was a favorite, as was the epic dual at the end. The sad truth is that you don't feel that way once you're older. You notice flaws and become more aware of the story. Look at it this way, every generation has their own thing. You had the original Star Wars, your fathers had the old westerns, their fathers had classic literature. The generation before doesn't get or like the next one. The reality is that they're all stories. Whichever one influenced you doesn't matter cause all good ideas come from somewhere. I was four years old when I said that I wanted to write. I'm eighteen now and that hope has never for a single moment left me. Cherish that, George Lucas.",7,1,3,14 December 2014
Star Trek," From a Star Wars Fan
","I was originally under the impression that if you're a Star Wars fan you're not a Star Trek fan. It's one or the other. But this film changed my outlook and I have gradually become more interested in the Trekverse. I came to realize these franchises are not opposites but complementary. Star Wars is a galaxy constantly at war so it has the better the special effects and action. Star Trek has the deeper story lines and characters. It is multiple galaxies trying to maintain peace. Star Wars is what we want and Star Trek is what we are. The storyline in this film isn't too weird for Star Trek standards and it does take on more action and humor than usual to make it more accessible and a good spot to start for newcomers. The storyline, as described by my friend, acts as a prequel, sequel, and reboot all at the same time. It tells how Mr. Spock, from the future, goes back in time into a parallel universe altering history as Trekkies know it. We follow younger versions of Kirk and Spock. Kirk is more rogue here than his later self but still more or less the lady killer we know him as. Mr Spock actually taking a love interest is quite dumb but nothing seriously untrue of his character is done. Many Trekkies disliked this film for straying from the philosophical feels of the original, but don't you want to convert at least a few non followers? The original series may seem a bit dull without a good solid introduction to the characters. To take one of their points, the story could be a bit more complicated and the villain could have been better but these are all small things that don't distract from a good science fiction flick. I recommend Trekkies show this to any stubborn Star Wars fan that wants nothing to do with Star Trek.",8,1,3,20 November 2014
2001: A Space Odyssey," More Than Words
","I don't know what this is about. My friend described this as having something to do with evolution and I guess it's possible it's about the transition. We're gradually seeing the next phase in where we're going. Apes to humans and machines to... the star child? I believe that's what Kubrick is going for. One thing that I liked about the film was that it doesn't use dialog all that much. That is a concept I'd like to see played with a little more. People understand everything through words. Words can affect you but what about the unheard feelings going on upon viewing? What do we feel when we see a friend drift helplessly into space? When a robot murders it's crew while in their sleep? Hell, what do you feel when you want the movie to get going? Well, if you're looking for a fun flick I don't recommend this at all. This is more like going to an art museum and pondering how somebody thought this up. I don't know if this is creative or not or if it deserves so much recognition. I'm leaning towards it does because I really want to see something that doesn't completely need dialog to carry out the emotions it wants you to feel. Boredom, helplessness, awe, intrigue. The film does carry all this out but do you care enough? Many directors did. Go look up online, I might do that. So I will leave off with give something with images and imagination if it's your thing. Even if it's not try giving a visual image of yourself to your friend.",Null,1,3,13 December 2014
Groundhog Day," A JPC Recommendation
","Groundhog Day is my favorite film because it deals with every aspect of life. You know you've felt like it's the same thing everyday before. You wake up, go to school or work, usual usual, come home to usual usual. You can abuse this, make a joke of it, kill some people, or help some people. Depending on how you approach it is what this day is actually about. The story is not so seemingly deep or preachy in the film as I may make it out because it is also entertainment which is how things should be looked back on. The worst experience is the most experience. Bill Murray's deadpan sarcasm adds to the amusement of this experience. I give the film ten stars because only a few films anymore leave an impression on me in a certain way. You see so many films and you get so bored and down with everyday sometimes you need to watch some douche deal with the same problem only in this film it's literal. A JPC recommendation goes to any film that leaves an actual impression on me where most others did not. This ones amusing, sad with a sarcastic main character, with romance, and about a holiday that nobody cares for. If there was ever a film about having a positive attitude this one I recommend.",10,1,2,19 November 2014
