Mission: Impossible III," Summer starts early this year
","Mission Impossible III has a plot that plays little importance to the actual merit of the movie, but it at least has enough respect for the audience to take into account the fact that we already know this. Whatever element of plot that can be found is merely an excuse for Tom Cruise to play dress-up, travel across the globe, and perform spectacular stunts. This is really what you want to see anyway, and everything else (which is the plot) is just filler. His mission involves something called 'The Rabbit's Foot.' Can it bring down the economy? Hack into government defense systems? Unleash a deadly virus? The kicker is, we never ever find out. All we know is that Ethan Hunt needs to get it. And that's all we really need to know.We see Phillip Seymour Hoffman post-Oscar win, showing his permanent status as a dedicated actor jumping from art house films to gigantic blockbusters, in a cool, slimy villain role. We get the brilliant inclusion of Shaun of the Dead's Simon Pegg. We get helicopter chases, brain bombs, parachuting, and some very decent fight scenes including one in which Cruise steals some moves from Russel Crowe by smacking a guy in the face with a telephone receiver. What more could you ask for?Mission Impossible originated as a TV show, so I think it was a good choice to bring in the popular director of shows such as Lost and Alias, J.J. Abrams to do this movie. I've never seen any of his shows but I can safely assume that MI:III is just a longer, big-budget version of one of his shows. John Woo directed the previous Mission installment, and I think he tried too hard to blow our minds with the action sequences and delved into tedious self-indulgence. Abrams has made a fast-paced, action-packed thrill ride that was genuinely fun. I only saw it yesterday and have probably forgotten most of it, though I'm sure I could have said the exact same thing the instant I walked out of the theatre. It's a perfect summer movie, though it's out in early May. Oh well.My rating: 7/10",7,2,4,8 May 2006
Dawn of the Dead," Apocalyptic
","More than any 'zombie' movie I've ever seen, this remake of Dawn Of The Dead feels most as if the world was actually ending. There's no surprise that Johnny Cash's 'The Man Comes Around' plays during the credits as we see news footage of the chaos occurring all over the world. Most of the movie takes place in a mall, so basically we're left in the dark as to what's going on everywhere else. The TV broadcasts have shut down, rescue helicopters have stopped coming, there's some guy on the roof of a building across the street. You start to wonder if these characters are the last surviving people on earth. Unlike the original Dawn Of The Dead, we aren't shown any other groups of people. And of course I have to bring this up: the running zombies. I actually thought it's scarier when they're running and screaming. Especially when they're in huge numbers like in one of the last sequences where the characters are trying to escape. But that's just my opinion. I guess overall more people prefer the slower, more reserved zombies. So to add it all up, there isn't anything really new or unique about this movie except maybe that the aspect of the apocalypse is accentuated more than it usually is in these kinds of movies. You have the long quiet scenes followed by a loud scare, the gruesome deaths, the comic relief thrown in here and there (really great comic relief by the way), all the ingredients to make a zombie movie. I probably would have liked it better if the ending wasn't so stupid but for the most part its really enjoyable and mildly scary. If you like zombie movies I don't see any reason why you wouldn't like this. It's a powerful horror/action flick. My rating: 8.5/10",8,3,6,25 April 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Based on a theme park ride, and feels like one
","I came out of Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest with an empty feeling. It leaves on a major cliffhanger, and instead of feeling excited and anxious to see what happens next, like one usually feels with cliffhangers, I felt completely ripped off. I felt like I've seen half a movie. Now, it's not exactly a new trend for guaranteed hit sequels to be filmed simultaneously to create some hackneyed 'trilogy,' but Dead Man's Chest has got to be the absolute worst example of this method to date. It is all set-up and no payoff whatsoever. We learn so little about the characters that we don't already know. It hints towards an attraction between Elizabeth and Jack, it presents a relationship between Will and his Dad, and in what is probably the only significantly developed character, Norrington, who was once engaged to Elizabeth, has now fallen hard on his luck, become embittered, and resorted to the ways of the pirate. The plot, among many aspects, mainly involves the pursuit of the Dead Man's Chest, hence the title. They find the damn thing but nothing really develops after that. I guess we have to find out what happens in the next one. Great.What sours me on this movie is that it accomplishes literally nothing. There are no resolutions, just bigger and badder problems that occur. The Matrix Reloaded at least had its own small plot inside its larger plot about Keanu Reeves' character dealing with premonitions of his loved one dying and finally having to face it, and Back to the Future Part II dealt with problems being solved in the future, past, and alternate universes that finally led to one one final time-travel accident that bridged into the concept of the sequel, etc. etc. So what was Dead Man's Chest? Jack is stupid and he has to pay for it? Dead Man's chest has the action scenes that run way too long and the usual hijinks of the beloved character, Jack Sparrow. What I do really like about this series is that the main characters aren't growing to be best buddies or anything. Usually in the first film the characters conflict and get on each others' nerves but by part 2 they're great friends (a la Star Wars), but it is not so with this trio, mainly because of the unreliability of Jack. They are basically only friends when it is convenient for him. The movie ends with Jack 'dying' and Will and Elizabeth, along with Jack's crew, mourning him and setting off to find a way to get him back. But, it really wouldn't surprise me if once they do save him in part 3, he'll find some way or another to screw them over. Particularly Will.I had no respect for the movie but I'll admit it had its fun moments and I thought the visual effects were amazing. Davy Jones (played green-suit style by Bill Nighy) is a really cool creation. Jones and his crew were apparently all CGI, but this was not one of those cases where you role your eyes and think it's so obviously fake. This time, in this movie, I really bought it.So, what can I really say to sum up Dead Man's Chest? I think it's shameless. And when you think about it, it is exactly- EXACTLY- like a ride in Disneyland. You wait so long in the line (or in this case waiting for the movie to come out), you finally get into it, and by the time it's all over you feel empty and ripped off and need more of it. So, you have to ride it again (or see what happens in part 3), and you have to wait even longer. Terrible! I would say that on the whole, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is an okay movie that pales in comparison to the first. Johnny Depp was great, the action scenes were sometimes fun, and the visual effects were top-of-the-line and probably the highlight of the movie for me. It deserves a slap in the face for its script and plot, but an Oscar for its effects.My rating: 6/10",6,2,5,30 July 2006
Batman Returns," Tim Burton's Yule Tide comic-book hero tragedy
","Batman Returns feels like a Tim Burton film much more than the first Batman did. It is a bit more peculiar, and has a wilder imagination. It also has much more going on than the first, we're introduced to many new characters and quite an amusing plot linking all of them together. This is the first of what will hopefully be many of Burton's films with a Christmas context (if you're a fan of his I obviously don't need to tell you the next one). I really liked that as a setting, it made it stand out much more than any other comic-book film adaptation. It's cold, there's snow, everything should be happy and magical but instead things go bad. I was surprised at just how moving this movie actually was; it really does make you think about the characters, and it is much more operatic and tragic than the first.All the characters were very fascinating, as each of the three main characters (the bat, the cat, and the penguin) came to be under some unfortunate circumstances. They all have the potential to do good (luckily Batman does), and they all seem to be half-creature, half-human, almost struggling with their identities and purposes. The connecting character between these creatures is Max Shreck, played by the always- great Christopher Walken. While he's the only fully human character, he seems to be the most inhuman, he's an evil guy who conflicts with each of them at some point. You probably know the plot or have seen the movie already, so I won't bother explaining the multi-layered plot, but it really came together in a great, unexpected way. The first Batman ended in a way that justice was served, and Batman will continue to be a hero and find a way to cope with his own life, and everything will be okay. This one was such a tragic tale that really portrayed the darker side of being Batman.There were so many things I liked about this movie. The relationship between Selina Kyle/Catwoman and Bruce Wayne/Batman was especially interesting. What really made it so sad was that they were so alike but Selina just couldn't pull it together. Two of my favourite parts of the movie occur during the Christmas party scene. First of course, was when Bruce and Selina finally find out each other's identities. That was such an indescribably moving scene that worked so perfectly. The other part was when Bruce confronts Max Shreck. Shreck talks about how he is the real secret power that runs the city, and that 'it doesn't matter who's mayor.' Bruce replies, 'it matters to me.' What should have been this big, powerful speech scene turns out very brief, when Shreck, clearly indifferent to Bruce Wayne, says 'YAWN,' then walks away. Not only was it amusing but I thought it did make a lot of sense, that's the way that character is.Danny Devito and some extremely talented makeup artists (not to mention the way the filmmakers ingeniously reinvented him) do a great job in bringing the evil penguin character to life. Honestly, I never saw Devito here. I could sort of make him out, but he really just got into the character so deeply that I saw just the character. I was very impressed with him, it's unlike anything he's ever done, and he certainly did not deserve that Razzie nomination! Danny Elfman's score was particularly incredible as well, and it's a sin that he did not get an Oscar nod.Batman Returns is much edgier and darker in mood than its predecessor. I love both movies, but I think I prefer this one. There was just so much more to it. I love the atmosphere they both create, and no other superhero movies have anything like it to offer.My rating: 9/10",9,0,0,8 November 2005
Alexander," Fortune did not favor Stone's bold film
","When Alexander was released on DVD, I was reminded of a joke Billy Crytal made when he hosted the Oscars: 'A new director's cut of 'Gigli' will be released which will run 2 hours shorter.' Audiences have the option of viewing the original theatrical cut of Alexander, and a new director's cut that is actually 8 minutes shorter. I have seen both versions, and there's not really much of a difference. Stone tones down some of the gay undertones in the director's cut, conforming to many criticisms. He also evens out the flashbacks a bit, which I think works better. It doesn't really matter which version you watch, if you don't like one you won't like the other, simple as that. Honestly, I only bought the director's cut because the entire movie fits on one disc. I liked Alexander, and it was by no means a bad movie.Stone explores Alexander The Great's personal life more than his battle tactics, which many believed to be a bad move. In a way, it was. Anyone who views the film alone would probably never get a grasp of what a brilliant mind he actually was. What I thought was very interesting though, was Alexander's unquenchable thirst to conquer new worlds, to push further, until it inevitably destroyed him. Ironically not dying in a battle, but in his bed, taken ill by bad water. So what drove Alexander? Was it to desperately win approval from his parents? Stone's vision seems to think this played a big part. While all the elements come together to make Alexander far more emotionally vulnerable than say, Maximus from Gladiator or Spartacus from...Spartacus, we're given an unexpected new kind of historical epic protagonist. I guess some people just didn't want to accept it, or maybe weren't ready for it.Alexander was not a bad movie. It is at times a little misguided, and there are some aspects that just didn't fly too well, but overall it was very good. Stone has given us a unique look at one of history's greatest figures. It did not do well financially, and some of its critics were absolutely merciless, but you'll never know until you judge it for yourself. My rating: 7/10",7,5,10,27 September 2005
Capote," An absorbing film with a stunning performance by Phillip Seymour Hoffman
","It's pretty rare to find yourself facing a screen, watching a film for the first time, and knowing without a single conceivable doubt that you are witnessing precious moments that are sure to define an actor's entire career. I felt this when watching Phillip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of Truman Capote. It is undeniably his best performance ever, and will be nearly impossible to top. He deserves an Oscar for this and his chances of winning are already more than excellent.Capote is a movie that just keeps getting better with each passing minute. Dan Futterman, a friend of Hoffman's, wrote the movie, which is one reason why he expressed an interest in playing Capote. He has also said that another reason, the main reason he wanted to do it, even above the challenge of playing this eccentric and fascinating character, was that the story was just so good. As a movie fan I initially saw it for Hoffman's performance, and for the first half hour that's all I really needed, but as the plot continued I found my self drawn in deeper and deeper. It's really an absorbing film with intriguing characters and superb acting.In a nutshell, I came for the acting, but I stayed for the story. Capote is one of 2005's highlights.My rating: 10/10",10,28,47,31 December 2005
Lost in Translation," A great film, but the rating was lost in translation
","It's very interesting to see all of the ratings that Lost In Translation received in different countries. In Canada it is only PG, while in America it's rated R! And really, the only explanation for this is a brief scene at a strip joint that shows some nudity. I really look down on that R rating because Lost In Translation is a good-hearted film that should be enjoyed by all ages. Notice how during the 2003 Oscar season two films played the 'only one special effect: the effect on the audience' card; one being this film and the other being Mystic River. Both are great films, both are rated R in the U.S., but only one of them can carry along its story without brutal murders.So what can I say about Lost In Translation that hasn't been said a million times already? It's all true. It's subtle, down-to-earth, and allows the audience to observe and relate to the characters, Bob and Charlotte. Both of them have a life crisis to deal with, and I guess if you're thousands and thousands of miles away from your problems it makes it easier to take an objective look at them, even if they do follow you. Bob and Charlotte confide in each other and develop a relationship. That's what it's all about, and every scene is precious. It's a real and true to life kind of film. We never hear the lines: 'Oh, Charlotte, I'm so glad I went to Japan. You've changed my life in such a profound way and you'll always be in my heart.' That's because that just isn't the way it goes in real life. The feeling is there, the characters know it, the audience knows it, so it has to be left at that.So, yeah, I love this movie. It's clearly the highlight of Bill Murray's career and marks the perfect first real stand-out in Scarlett Johanson's. It's so rare to see a movie that only has an interest in its characters (and only two of them, at that!) and makes them so charming, lovable, and familiar. This is a great example of non-Hollywood Hollywood films: the well-known actors and producers going to the roots of independent film-making. In an age where half the movies out there are packed with CGI, this is refreshing to see.My rating: 10/10",10,507,657,20 February 2005
Aliens," One of the most thrilling films ever- special edition highly recommended
","James Cameron is an extremely talented action director because not only does he know great action, but he always backs the action up with a great story and interesting characters. Aliens is his finest achievement, as far as I'm concerned. Of course, I should specify: Aliens Special Edition is his finest achievement.In 1986 several scenes were cut to keep the movie's run-time reasonable but there was one scene that was incredibly foolish to leave out. The scene I refer to is near the beginning where Ripley learns that her daughter has died while she was away in 'hypersleep' for 57 years. 'I promised her I'd be home for her 11th birthday,' cries Ripley. This is a very moving scene that adds a great deal the character's depth and makes more sense to why she cares for a little girl named Newt later in the film. She's seeking penance through Newt with her love and determination to keep her alive at all costs. The theatrical edition obviously doesn't elude to any of this, and even cheapens the relationship between Ripley and Newt- just a little bit. James Cameron has said that all of his movies are love stories, and Aliens is a story of parental love. He has also said that the special edition is his intended (if not definitive) version of the film. For about five years or so the Special Edition was the only version of Aliens you could get on DVD. It should have stayed that way.Aliens is a unique film experience: it's genuinely thrilling and exciting, unlike a lot of movies where people shoot the evil monsters and there's disgusting blood and rapid gunfire, and it's really meaningless. In Aliens' case, the aliens are very threatening and more than just target practice. We don't see any aliens for over an hour, but once we do, it's a huge payoff. By that time, we get to know some interesting characters: Hicks (Michael Beihn), a take-charge marine who also turns out to be sweet and sincere, Hudson (Bill Paxton), a braggart who turns out to be a coward and complains most of the time, Vasquez (Jeanette Goldstein), the iron-willed woman soldier who proves to be one of the bravest characters in the film, Bishop (Lance Henrikson), a robot that is very helpful for everyone's survival, Burke (Paul Rieser), the slimy company man who the audience loves to hate, and of course, the adorable little Newt (Carrie Henn), a girl who has survived unspeakable horror. Holding the whole film together is Ripley, played by Sigourney Weaver in her surprise-Oscar-nominated performance. I think the only reason why the audience cared for her in the first film is because she was the only person left and we wanted her to live. But for this film, James Cameron added so much to her. With all this investment in characters, we're really concerned for their well-being. We don't want those aliens to get them. Some die, and I'm always truly bummed out when it happens.Filled with amazing performances and an abundance of thrills, Aliens is one of the greatest of any genre it attempts: whether it's action, sci-fi, horror, or even drama. I personally liked it better than the first film, but it's really like comparing apples and oranges. I prefer the special edition and don't see why anyone should view the other version instead.My rating: 10/10",10,228,265,31 August 2005
Alien vs. Predator," You get what you paid for..
","With a title like 'Alien Vs Predator,' you're obviously going to expect some alien and predator battles, hopefully with some human interaction as well. AVP doesn't disappoint in that area. I thought the fight scenes were very good and the only saving grace of the movie. Other than that, well, there's nothing else. This is a bad movie.It starts out okay enough, the pacing is true to the original alien films. It's slow and builds up tension...only to use its first shock on a penguin. But oh well. It only gets worse from there, though. We're introduced to a bunch of characters we obviously don't give a care about and are more than likely to die in terrible ways. That begs the question, why exactly are we being told that they have loving families waiting for them at home? Are we supposed to feel sympathetic when they die? I mean, come on, it's all or nothing. You should either not care at all about a character and chomp on popcorn as they're brutally killed, or truly feel bad when they die. AVP put me in an uncomfortable position. I didn't feel bad but I felt as if I was expected to.The plot's ridiculous. I think anyone who's seen it and either loves it or hates it can agree with that. I don't think I've ever heard that it's a brilliant, original plot from anyone. But, honestly, I didn't really pay to see the movie for a plot. That would be nice and all, but I really just paid to see aliens and predators beat the ever-loving @#$%&! out of each other. I wasn't let down. That's the only merit the movie has anyway.My rating: 5/10",5,1,2,2 February 2005
The Pianist," Shock appeal?
","The Pianist is not a movie made for entertainment. It's either more or less than that and only the viewer can decide. You have to ask yourself sometimes if the main reason films about the holocaust are so popular is because of shock appeal. If a movie depicts these terrifying events well, does that make it a good movie? The Pianist has many scenes showing the Nazi's brutality that feel almost voyeuristic. Some scenes show Adrien Brody's character looking out the window at these terrible things and you feel as if you're looking out a window, too.I hope shock appeal isn't the reason this film is liked so much, though. Because this is an amazing story about the will to survive. Music is the character's passion,and throughout his struggles he can only fantasize about playing piano. There is one scene near the end in which he finally gets the opportunity. What follows is a touching moment that transitions from rusty skills warming up to an intense and passionate display of artistic talent. In this moment there is no longer a war going on, no longer the agony of hunger or memories of lost loved ones, just beautiful music. His reputation as a musician and his desire to go on to play again is essentially what keeps him alive. And who says art isn't important?Adrien Brody is very good in this. Well obviously he is, he just won the Best Actor Oscar. I think he can be compared to Tom Hanks in Cast Away- even in scenes of silence there's just something about the actor's movements and expressions that keeps you engaged.There's another scene near the end that defines the entire performance, the entire movie for me: After all the trouble Brody went through trying to survive, he is almost killed by the people who would save him. He is wearing a coat that a German officer had given him earlier, and when Russian troops spotted Brody they thought he was German. They shot at him and almost killed him, but they finally found out he was Polish. An officer asks him, 'Why the f-cking coat?' Brody, with his hands still in the air, a terrified look on his face, almost crying, replies: 'I'm cold.' That did it for me.The Pianist is certainly a shocking and even depressing film, but like most movies that aspire to provoke thoughts and emotions, the audience takes out of it what they bring in to it. Surely Szpiellman wasn't just a lucky bastard who survived in times of inhumane brutality. It was through the kindness and compassion of others who helped him, if only because they found themselves inexplicably moved by his music.My rating: 10/10",10,17,28,30 March 2003
Back to the Future Part III," Satisfactory at best
","My main reason for wanting to see this movie was to find out what happens after part II, and after seeing this, I think they could have easily ended everything in that second part. But, in a way, I'm glad they didn't. It's not as great as the first 2 (final parts in trilogies rarely are) but by now I just liked the characters so much that it was nice to see them on one last adventure. This time it focuses more on the characters than any time travel paradoxes. Doc Brown falls in love, and Marty seems to grow up and take responsibility for things. That's all well and good but I never really felt the same excitement as I did while watching the first 2. I guess because this plays out more like an old west comedy than a time travel movie. As a final entry in a trilogy I found this to be only satisfactory at best.I do recommend this movie though, it's still funny and entertaining. It's just not as funny and entertaining as its predecessors.My rating: 5.5/10",5,3,9,7 September 2003
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Save your Job. Save your @$$. Save your soul.
","I saw this movie the day after I saw Peter Jackson's King Kong. Compared to a movie that drones on and on for 3 hours, I found Good Night, and Good Luck, a movie no longer than 90 minutes, to be a much more rewarding and worth-while film experience. As the story begins, we see room full of reporters and investigators chatting and joking about what they should air, while in the back of room, sitting still and silently, is Edward R. Murrow (played wonderfully by David Strathairn). This quiet, humble man, as we learn in the prior scene, will soon emerge as a hero.When I came into the movie I expected to see a rousing story about the little guy standing up to the big powerful villain and taking him down. What it ended up being was so much better than that. This is not a David versus Goliath story, it's not a 'going the distance' story ala Rocky Balboa, this is a story about right and wrong. It's about morals. Edward Murrow saw that senator Joe McCarthy was doing wrong, abusing his power, and causing unneeded grief in already difficult times. Murrow saw that he himself had a position of power, having access to millions of homes as a television personality, and he used it to get his message across. With help from some other brave friends, including Fred Friendly (George Clooney), this mission came with both victory and sacrifice, both of which he was willing to accept. The film opens and closes with a speech Murrow makes several years after his battle with McCarthy. His words tingle with relevance, urgently and obviously intentionally applying to modern times. It really doesn't matter if it's the 1950's or 2005: if used with honourable intentions, and most importantly, the truth, the media can change the world for the better.George Clooney, merely in his second directorial effort, has made an excellent film. It's serious when it needs to be, and it's casual and down-to-earth at moments when we need to be reminded that this is real life. David Strathairn leads an enormously talented cast, giving the best performance of his career, and one of the best acting showcases of year (topped only by Philip Seymour Hoffman as Truman Capote in my opinion). See you on Oscar night. Good Night, and Good Luck.My rating: 10/10",10,3,5,8 January 2006
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," A very good movie, a very shameless release
","I guess you can leave it up to Quentin Tarantino and the good people at Mirimax to make a franchise out of one movie. Unlike films such as The Lord Of The Rings and The Matrix, the cutting in half of Kill Bill was an after thought. Tarantino believed that people wouldn't be able to handle a 3-and-a-half hour Kill Bill film, which is ridiculous because, bringing up Lord Of The Rings again, I know that many people went to see screenings of all 3 LOTR films back-to-back. Now that's one long movie, go ahead and do the math, and that just shows how devoted fans can be. And now, Tarantino has ripped off his loyal fans, charging two separate prices for one film. And don't get me started with the whole bare bones DVDs with the intent of releasing special editions in the future 'multiple bites of the apple' issue. Just shameless.But, you have to suck it up. It's a pain, yes, but underneath it all we do have a quality movie here. After waiting more than half a decade since Jackie Brown, Quentin Tarantino has come back to films with a vengeance. This time around he borrows from and references so many movies that it's nearly impossible to keep track of them all. For me, at least, since I'm not exactly a huge fan of the martial arts genre. But that's okay, because Tarantino interprets it all in a way that is pretty clever and enjoyable. In a way it's the merging of American and Japanese styles of film-making. There's martial arts and anime, but there's also some jive talk, so ya know, it's a good mix. And I have to say that it undoubtedly features one of the best action sequences of the last decade.The cast (or human props if you prefer) is well thought out and of good variety. Uma Thurman, the star, is obviously the stand-out. She's a little bit scary and a little bit sexy, she just kicks butt. She does absolutely everything necessary in what she calls her 'role of a lifetime' and surely needs to be regarded from now on as one of the best female action characters in cinema.It sucks having to pay twice the amount of money for one movie, but as far as this particular half goes, it is really enjoyable. There's no doubt in my mind that vol.2 is the superior half, but this is a fun film loaded with action, gore, and all the things you could ever want from a Quentin Tarantino film.My rating: 8.5/10",8,4,9,27 January 2005
Saw II," Sick and twisted
","If you think movies like Friday the 13th or Scream are exploitive then it would be wise to avoid this movie at all costs. Since lots of blood has slowly but surely become acceptable in the theatres it's the job of sick minds behind the camera to come up with new ways to shock audiences. In the 80's, heads were being lopped off, people were stabbed and what not, and it all just seemed to get old real fast. By the time the 90's came there were very few movies that actually tried to be creative or reinvent some of the old ideas; the hit Scream movies did this, and also a little movie called Se7en. The victims in Se7en were actually not-so-great of people and were more or less tortured to death by a killer who felt completely justified. Now, we have the Saw movies, and not only are they pushing the envelope, they're cutting it apart and setting it on fire. 20 years ago you'd have to find a movie like this in the pornography section with all the other Hammer films, but today it's number one at the box-office.The appeal is pretty clear: modern audiences aren't really shocked by simple killings anymore. Now we need to see people being tortured and mutilated to actually feel alive. What also helps is that aside from that, it is pretty absorbing. People like twists and turns, and Saw II is not too much unlike watching an episode of CSI. What is really interesting and grabbed my attention was the fact that this evil 'Jigsaw killer' was not some superhuman zombie that kills senselessly, but an old man. An old man with cancer, at that! And he doesn't just randomly kill, he hand-picks his victims, and really takes time to think his sadistic plans through. A sick mind proves to be more dangerous than any machete, which is pretty frightening.Saw II was not really much better or worse than the first one. It's bigger: there's more characters, much more blood, but probably an equal amount of twists. Personally, I prefer the first Saw. It had that indie film charm, where it's just these two guys in a room with a puzzle to solve. The game in Saw II plays out as less of a puzzle, more of a fun-house of horrors. Just like the first, there is a final 'end twist.' It was more believable than the first film's twist but not as scary or shocking.I like to think I'm fairly desensitized to movie violence, but I'll admit that Saw II had me cringing at more than a few points. So for all intents and purposes, Saw II's verdict is: mission accomplished. My only concern is wondering where we'll find horror/gore films in the next ten years. How far can you go?

From Dusk Till Dawn," Never a dull moment
","After seeing it's explosive opening (pun intended), I knew that From Dusk Till Dawn would not be your average thriller. What starts out like Natural Born Killers ends up like Evil Dead. That's what I love about this movie- you just have no idea what to expect. Also, as most movies even remotely related to Quentin Tarantino, this has a great cast. Everyone from Harvey Keitel and George Clooney, to Cheech Marin who has not 1, not 2, but 3 roles.Don't expect too much character developlement or symbolism in From Dusk Till Dawn, you won't find it. Make sure to expect a lot of vampires, though. You won't be disappointed in that area. There's plenty of gore and catchy lines, I garantee that you'll be kept entertained during the course of the movie.I really liked From Dusk Till Dawn. It's no Citizen Kane but it's good in it's own feild. Pure entertainment. My rating: 7.5/10",7,1,2,21 April 2003
World Trade Center," Oliver Stone: Hollywood Conformist
","I would definitely say that I am a fan of Oliver Stone's work, but the sad truth is that he hasn't really made anything particularly exceptional in the last decade. Alexander was considered a huge failure (though I thought it was good), and ever since its negative response and poor box office performance, Stone seems desperately eager to please. First, he makes a 'director's cut' of Alexander, cutting out anything too 'gay,' and now he has made World Trade Center. His clear intention is to go against every expectation an audience would have when they hear Oliver Stone has directed a film about 9/11. There is no political agenda, it is more about emotion and character, but it just plainly and simply is not good, and drags on way too long.It isn't completely bad, the first act was actually very good. I had a feeling that it would get even better after the tower collapse scene, and I was more than ready to commit myself emotionally to these characters. However, it did not get better; it gradually became pretty bad, resorting to shameless emotional manipulation complete with an over-abundance of flashbacks to back when the two men were happy in their lives with their families, and the 'for your consideration' speeches from the wives.What really just pisses me off about this movie is that even though it's a true story (and a great, happy, positive one!), it barely takes into account the fact that thousands of people lost their lives that day. It's a sappy, sugar-coated tale that treats the audience like infants, assuming that a movie about a family of the officers that didn't survive and how they have to deal with it just wouldn't sell enough tickets. The message we're left with at the end of the film is unbelievably moronic: apparently, in times of need, people will do what's right, and help other people, and shucks, you know what- that's good in my book. Give me a break. This movie is insulting to peoples' intelligence, their emotions, and it's also insulting to anyone who lost someone they loved on that terrible day.World Trade Center really is everything you could hope that a 9/11 movie wouldn't be. This is something you'd expect from Michael Bay. What's worse is that it's even getting Oscar buzz, which I feel it is unworthy of. The profoundly superior 9/11 film is United 93, which is blunt, frank, and treats the audience and the 9/11 victims with a courageous respect that we just don't see enough of in films based on true tragedies. I left World Trade Center feeling angry and frustrated for many, many reasons. It is one of the year's most disappointing and unnecessary films.My rating: 5/10",5,6,12,24 September 2006
The Mummy Returns," A waste of time
","The Mummy Returns in no way compares to the original. The special effects, the acting, the storyline, the comic relief, and even the music are all completely cheesy. Even worse, the movie tries to take itself seriously while the audience just can't. I can't even begin to explain how disappointed I was with this movie, especially since the first Mummy was so great. The first had lots of adventure and a good story to it but this one doesn't. The action is boring and repetitive. The story is pointless. I don't see any reason how anyone could like this one better.There were some good parts, but not enough to save this horrible movie. It also runs painfully long. Any movie this bad shouldn't be over two hours. It shouldn't even be more than two minutes. I can't believe that The Mummy Returns made so much money, and it did better than the original. If you're actually willing to see this movie, please don't waste any money on it. Wait for TV.My rating: 1/10",1,3,7,1 February 2003
The Fly," Better than the original and one of the best horror films ever made
","David Cronenberg redefined what we think of as creepy with this brilliant film. The makeup special effects and grossouts are top notch, but what is most surprising about The Fly is that it turns out to be a very well acted and emotional love story. It greatly surpasses the original '58 version.The film focuses on the relationship between Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis at the top and once it takes its turn towards horror it really pays off. It's not just scary, it's a tragedy too. Jeff Goldblum is phenomenal. He is mesmerizing as he delivers great dialogue and once he's barely recognizable he still breaks through the makeup and you can feel the human inside. I can't believe he didn't get an Oscar for this, it's easily his best performance. I can't express how much I love The Fly. It's more than just horror, and it's proof that you just may find a truly great movie where you least expect it. My rating: 10/10",10,199,235,16 July 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," In a whole different league than the first
","At the end of the original Matrix film, after Neo comes back to life, there is this sort of moment of realization. All the rules are broken, and we're given a glimpse of all the possibilities of this world with no rules. That moment of realization is expanded throughout all of Reloaded, and we're given so much more than just a glimpse. If The Matrix is about paranoia, than The Matrix Reloaded is certainly about discovery. I definitely liked the first better, but I really appreciate how this one takes everything further and stays 10 steps ahead of the audience. Remember when the original first came out and everyone said how confusing the plot was at first? Looking back now, that plot was simple compared to this one. You have to watch Reloaded a couple of times to really get a hold of everything.Along with the advanced plot, the special effects are advanced, too. There are some great fight scenes, and of course the infamous freeway chase sequence. In between all the action there is a lot of talk. Mostly about very confusing paradoxal stuff. You start to wonder if Stephen Hawking had a hand in writing the script. But I really liked those parts. No movie has really asked all of these questions and created such a unique world to ask them in. Those were the parts that got people to watch the movie again.The only parts that I can actually say bored me were all the scenes taking place on Zion. That's where a lot of the film's weak points take place, such as Morpheus' cheesy speech. Sure, it was probably intentionally cheesy (that seems like just the kind of character Morpheus is), and I didn't hate or resent the Zion scenes, I just wish they were shorter. Around those points I usually hit the fast-forward button. I was most interested by the scenes inside the Matrix.I really liked this movie overall. I was hesitant to see it at first since I loved the original so much, and I thought the commercials for Reloaded looked pretty stupid, but I took a chance and I really enjoyed it. I can't wait to see Revolutions.My rating: 7.5/10",7,1,2,18 January 2004
The Fountain," Aronosfky the auteur
","There is something going on here. If I were to say that I knew what everything in The Fountain is supposed to mean, I'd probably be a damn liar. That said, I feel that I got the general idea. Many people have compared this film's esoteric, pseudo-intellectual appeal to something like Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, but I think this is a wrong claim to make. There are many moments in the Fountain in which the story is too desperately being explained to us. Rachel Weisz is an amazing actress, but God bless her, half her lines in the movie feel like she's just spoon-feeding us important information. It took the joy away from a movie that should (though mostly does) communicate on an emotional level more than anything else. Even if you don't really know why, The Fountain has the ability to provoke some powerful emotions. Unfortunately, it does not do much else.While watching the film, I sensed that Darren Aronofsky has become a director that believes in his own myth. People have called him one of the great contemporary directors, and now he has come up with this movie, which, at times, is just completely up its own ass. Fans of Aronofsky will no doubt love this and hail it as a triumph of the modern auteur.If you were to remove the entire concept of past and future from the movie, you'd have a story of a man with a love so intense for the woman he lost, he would never, ever recover. Since we do get the other, more wondrous aspects to it, The Fountain becomes a more memorable, unique film, and has a beautiful sense of hope to it. It is a very one-sided love story though. It is mainly about Hugh Jackman's character's experiences. Aronosky's wife, the lovely Weisz, has to play a character who is never fully realized, and is degraded to an object of affection and goal for the main character, and someone who lays down all the important information to get the plot rolling.I generally liked The Fountain, it had incredible visual effects that weren't CGI for once, it features a haunting musical score by Clint Mansell, good performances by Jackman and Weisz, and was emotionally hard-hitting. It's the the kind of film that just begs for repeat viewings, but it's honestly not as clever or deep as it thinks it is.My rating: 7/10",7,1,2,27 December 2006
War of the Worlds," Finds itself somewhere between 'Independance Day' and 'Signs'
","In the late 1990's, when movies like Independence Day and Armageddon became box-office hits, a certain romanticism was brought to the idea of cities being destroyed and countless lives being lost. As long as Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum and Ben Affleck eventually saved the day, it was fun. After 9/11, of course(!), audiences got a rude awakening. After that, movies such as The Core echoed through empty theatres and audiences gave The Day After Tomorrow the cold shoulder. I thought that M. Night Shalaman's Signs tapped into our real fears: the main characters were not witness to any destruction, but anxiously sat by the TV and radio to await further information regarding the terror around the world. This is something most audiences can relate to, since it's what millions of people did that tragic day in September, and even just a few days ago when London was attacked.Steven Spielberg's War of the Worlds somehow arrives in a zone that's not quite Independence Day, but not quite Signs, either. There are the big special effects sequences in which random citizens are killed, but there are also those quiet, sincere moments of a family living in fear, not knowing what to do, trying to survive. I didn't care as much for the family in War of the Worlds as I did for the family in Signs, though. Signs would still be an interesting movie without the aliens, but this movie wouldn't. We get the usual Speilbergian characteristics of a family, namely the deadbeat dad, played by Tom Cruise. I cared for the characters only because they're such a familiar breed and because we get about 20-30 minutes to get to know them and become accustomed to them. However, there's nothing all too unique about them.All that aside, War Of The Worlds is a truly frightening movie, which I think is the key. The world being destroyed is no longer fun, it's scary. There's something very nightmarish about this movie and it has a sense overwhelming fear and feeling of helplessness. There is only one scene that had me rolling my eyes, which was a 'tense' sequence near the end of the movie which seemed to last well over ten minutes. At first it may have had me on the edge of my seat, but after being so drawn out, it just reminded me of how much better the raptor scene in Jurrasic Park was in comparison. But...oh well.My rating: 8/10",8,4,7,9 July 2005
To Kill a Mockingbird," Monumental
","To Kill A Mocking Bird still remains one of the most powerful and thought-provoking movies of all time and there's no surprise why. It's a great movie based on an equally great book by Harper Lee. A lot of parts from the book are missing from the movie but nothing too important so it doesn't take away from the core of the story.Technically Scout is the main character and the story revolves around her, but Gregory Peck really steals the show as Atticus Finch. He is just amazing to watch. I was surprised to read on this site that Robert Duvall plays Boo Radley. I really couldn't recognize him. Still Can't.What else can I say? To Kill A Mocking Bird is a classic. It'll definitely still be remembered in another 40 years.My Rating: 10/10",10,2,5,1 February 2003
Man on Fire," Tony Scott painfully misdirects what could've been an amazing movie
","Man On Fire has the style of Oliver Stone on a bad day. In fact, it has the style of a 2 minute trailer. If they re-edited this and toned down the Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, this would be a great movie. I'm not saying get rid of all of it, because some of it was effective, but A LOT of it was not needed.As far as story goes, it was very good. Creasy is the familiar kind of character who is in dire need of redemption, and he receives it from an unlikely person: the child he's been hired to protect, Pita. Their relationship takes a good half hour or so (movie time wise) to develop, so it makes it all the more painful once she's kidnapped and supposedly killed. Of course, I don't think anyone in the audience really believes she's dead. In fact, I would have been more surprised if she actually was. Fortunately there were plenty of twists and turns along the way that made me forgive this predictability.The movie does a good job of making you care for the characters, but that probably is mostly because of the script and acting, not Tony Scott's hack directing. Denzel Washington gives a wonderfully intense performance as the man on fire, and everyone's favourite lil' child actor Dakota Fanning does a good job of just doing what she's supposed to with her role. She's supposed to be a cute little girl that is instantly lovable and she's able to do it effortlessly because, well, she's Dakota Fanning.Man On Fire is just about 2 and a half hours long and it kept my interest all the way through. The interest wasn't always positive since I had to roll my eyes every 5 minutes at the nausea-inducing editing. It took away so much! It was such a good movie but its biggest disappointment is that it could have been great.My rating: 6/10",6,7,16,9 March 2005
The Last King of Scotland," An entertaining and thrilling film
","The Last King of Scotland is not a film about the ruthless, sadistic dictator Idi Amin. It is actually about a lost youth, who lives with such a reckless abandon that he does not care whose lives he interferes with, as long as he fulfills his hedonistic desires. It's no surprise that in the rush of things after he whimsically decides to practice medicine in Uganda (anything is better than becoming an exact duplicate of his father), he unknowingly becomes best friends with the devil.Most of the politics of Amin and his rule are side-stepped in order to focus on the story of this fictional character, Nicholas, played by James McAvoy. Some may think this is a bad idea, and in a way it is, but surprisingly, the film works incredibly well as this morality tale, as well as a very intense thriller. I felt it was something of a mix of Wall Street and Midnight Express, and you can't really go wrong there.Forest Whitaker plays Amin, and even though his character is not the central focus of the story, he certainly steals the show. This is one of those rare, amazing performances that always leaves you anticipating the actor's next scene. It's such a delicious role that maybe if Amin actually WAS the focus of the story, it just might not pay off as well. In the case of Whitaker's perfect, career-defining performance, less has proved to be more.This was not exactly the kind of film I was expecting, but I enjoyed it thoroughly nevertheless. Both Idi Amin and Nicholas are well fleshed out characters. Amin's charm and madness are hypnotic to behold. Nicholas' journey from being a naive fool to finally taking some responsibility unfolds very well and convincingly. He may be fictitious creation, but what is said to him by a certain character at the end, about the role he must finally play, is completely plausible.The Last King of Scotland features incredible work by Whitaker, all-around great acting, and it always kept me on the edge of my seat. It may not have had much of a political agenda, but it was still one hell of an entertaining film of the highest quality.My rating: 9/10",9,3,4,13 February 2007
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Fast-paced and action-packed
","This is definitely the grittiest of all the 3 Die Hard films. John Mclane is now a drunk, he's separated from his family, living in New York, and to make matters worse a terrorist calling himself 'Simon' is out for revenge on Mclane. Mclane, and everyone else, has absolutely no idea why.The first 2 films are superior to this one since this has a lot of changes from the mood that made the others so great. First off, it's not set on Christmas. No biggie though. Secondly, there are too many complications and twists to the plot. You almost have to take notes. And thirdly, the biggest change is that it's now turned into a buddy movie to the style of Lethal Weapon, since Samuel L. Jackson as Zeus unwillingly teams up with John Mclane. They're complete opposites, they argue, and they become friends. That sort of stuff.Die Hard: With A Vengeance still stays true to it's amazing action scenes, though. There's plenty of explosions, there's floods, and overall general destruction. It's a different kind of movie, yes. But it's a good different kind of movie.My rating: 9/10",9,50,61,23 March 2003
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," The perfected art of being stupid
","In a year packed with comedies that were all a bit stupid and silly (and all seemed to feature Ben Stiller), Anchorman: The Legend Of Ron Burgundy reigns supreme above them all. This is a movie that is well aware of its own stupidity, and best of all, it is able to embrace it skillfully so that it is exactly as silly and immature as it wants to be. It is such a great comedy; I'd consider it the Naked Gun of our generation.As apposed to many, many, other comedies, Anchorman actually gets better as it moves along. Most of the time a comedy like this will use up all the laughs in the first hour and then try to take a serious, lovey-dovey turn in the last act. There are more laughs in the last half hour than in the first half hour, which usually is never the case. It's as if there was some mathematical comedic formula that spread the laughs out in a way that it was consistently funny. Or, maybe they just got lucky. I dunno.I loved all the characters in the movie, every role no matter how small had a great moment or two. Will Ferrel of course, the star of the movie who is just perfect as Ron. He's so so funny 'cause he's such a lovable idiot. Even Christina Appelgate, who was in a role that quite honestly anyone could have done, is able to make it her own and provide some laughs. There is a scene that has a lot of cameos that was hilarious as well. It was one of those moments that takes you completely by surprise.So, what else can I say except that I loved Anchorman! It's the best 'stupid' comedy I've seen in years. This is Will Ferrel at his best and it will be hard to top.My rating: 9/10",9,180,263,9 March 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The origins of Darth Vader revealed!
","Now that the final(?) Star Wars film has been released, the gap between the two hit trilogies has been filled. Of the 3 prequels, this is the most important, and the best as well. I really don't doubt that Fox will release a 6 DVD collection, and that fans will be happy to finally get a chance to view all the films of the saga in order. But now that any person has the chance to do this, I wouldn't recommend, not for a single second, that someone should be introduced to the Star Wars films by viewing episodes in order of I-VI. If the new, not-nearly-as-good trilogy has taught me anything, it's that it's essential to be viewed after seeing the originals. Of course, no one has this problem yet, as most people have already seen the 1977-1983 trilogy first, anyway. But surely any fan who someday has kids and wants to show them these movies will have a hard time getting them to warm to the droning dialogue of the 1999-2005 series.I thought this was a good entry because it went to a lot of effort to show what made that rambunctious little boy from episode I turn into the evil Darth Vader that we all know and love. Yes, it got lazy in some respects, like names. They seem to be just floating in the air, waiting for the characters to grab them without thinking twice ('from now on you shall be known as Darth Vader,' 'Luke...Leia'). But what they got right on was the mindset on Anakin. Things just go to a point of no return for him. It is kind of sad, kind of tragic.This is a pretty good movie but I think that the problem with the prequels is that they became limited since the main focus is with Anakin and Obi-Wan. Right from Episode I, we all knew it would probably end up something like this. It's a completely joyless series. Fun and entertaining sometimes, but joyless nevertheless.My rating: 8/10",8,4,7,18 June 2005
Ray," The chronicles of Ray
","As far as music star biopics go, you could be able to compare Ray to something like The Buddy Holly Story. First and foremost, you have an actor that gives an excellent performance and totally embodies the look, style, and soul of the film's subject. Jamie Foxx does this for Ray Charles, as Gary Busey did for Buddy Holly. The concern for story is your basic rise to fame and personal life aspects. The film portrays Ray's drug addictions, affairs, and flashbacks of his past with a sincere interest. And, occupying nearly half of the film is the great music of Ray Charles. Whether it's a scene with Ray in the studio, playing at a concert, or just in the background, we get to hear some of his best music.Taylor Hackford doesn't really take an excessive amount of artistic license in bringing the Ray Charles story to the screen, and I guess it's appropriate. This film is a celebration of the man's life, and it gently lays down events, the good and the bad. Hackford's vision tries to show Ray's struggle with the guilt for his brother's death, which turns him to drugs, which leads to worse things. Some great success and fame occur in between all of this, and by the end, this is all resolved in a sort of cheesy way, but the main point is a powerful one.The guilt aspect was the only 'angle' I can really think of that Hackford uses to justify character choices/development. Take for example the scene in Georgia when Ray refuses to perform because the audience is segregated. It seems as if he makes the decision on a whim. We're never given any insight to Ray's stance on racial equity except that in the next scene he says the incident in Georgia was not right. So, I guess what they were going for was that Ray needed to do something- anything- to redeem himself and he took the first opportunity he could get. Whether that's the way it was in real life or not, that's the way it is in this movie.Ray is a success because you can tell that everyone involved with it had a great love for Ray Charles and his music, and wanted to do the best job possible. They did. The story of his life is such an amazing one, and it was told with great talent, skill, and love.My rating: 10/10",10,2,4,9 March 2005
The Terminal," Feel-good
","It's funny how Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, two of Hollywood's most powerful men, who could literally do any movie they want, end up making something like The Terminal. Instead of reaching for new heights of film-making like including the latest in special effects, or new original ways of storytelling and editing, Spielberg goes back to a simpler form. That in itself is surprisingly refreshing. Filmmakers try so hard to be inventive and change the typical form of the classics, that when someone finally does go back to that Capra or Wilder fashion, it ends up seeming original. That's what The Terminal goes for. A movie about characters, not plot. About emotion, not CGI. It's a true heart-felt piece of work. It's funny, it's cute, and it always keeps you interested.Tom Hanks leads an exceptional cast as Viktor Navorski, a man stranded in JFK airport, not welcome in the U.S. and having no country to come home to. Throughout the experience he makes friends, a love interest, and a rival. He changes all of their lives, of course. That's to be expected from a movie like this. Tom Hanks is totally believable, accent and all. It's a performance well worthy of an Oscar nod.I loved The Terminal for many reasons, but one big reason is it's simplicity. And more importantly, because it is good at being simple. It doesn't contribute anything new to movies, it doesn't try to. It is what it is. A great, feel-good film. Something that is getting rarer and rarer these days. Sometimes you'll want to see a gritty, wrenching melodrama, but other times you'll want to see The Terminal.My rating: 10/10",10,318,416,8 July 2004
Back to the Future Part II," Entertaining all the way through
","Back To The Future Part II is one of those movies where there a new problem occurs every 5 minutes. It's non-stop action, comedy, and time travel paradoxes throughout the entire movie and you'll barely have time to catch your breath. There are a lot of confusing elements to the story but the movie explains itself so well that you never lose track of what's going on. With all the excitement, it lacks a lot of the heart of the first Back To The Future film but it's so enjoyable that I really didn't care. It's the most entertaining entry in the trilogy and it's just generally one of the most entertaining movies I've seen.My rating: 9/10",9,2,4,27 August 2003
The Queen," It could have been a melodramatic TV movie; instead, it exceeds any and all expectations and is one of the best films of 2006
","Queen Elizabeth's actions in response to ex-HRH's Diana's tragic death were held in such a crucial regard that the very Monarchy was is jeopardy. I didn't know this. If information like this doesn't interest you in the slightest, you might not enjoy The Queen as much as I did. Either way, this is an excellent drama. It is framed between two different meetings between Tony Blair and Queen Elizabeth. The first meeting is when Blair first becomes Prime Minister, the second meeting occurs a good deal of time after the turbulent week following Diana's death. This is a wonderful film about the changing of times and values, about crucial decisions, and about the importance of compromise. The process of the film is really remarkable. It takes something that essentially could have been a Hallmark movie of the week, but it rises so far above it: there is a lack of pretension in its urgent, quiet scenes. It is a sincere film with a valuable political message that is not at all preachy. I'd compare this to 2005's Good Night, and Good Luck.Needless to say, the performances here are pitch perfect. Hellen Mirren, obviously, leads the show with a performance that is sure to win her an Oscar. It's more than just imitation of a public figure. She gives life to this role and creates a strong, genuine character. And how sad is it that these days in mainstream movies we have to have an actress play a QUEEN in order to display any kind of strength? It's nice to see a strong female character that isn't overcoming sexism, or the supportive wife/girlfriend, or enduring unimaginable suffering, or battling aliens or vampires. Mirren is just simply breathtaking: she's intimidating, but also warm, and is always true to the character. There is one scene in which she breaks down and cries, but wisely to the part of the filmmakers, we only see her with her back facing the camera.The rest of the cast is terrific as well. There isn't a single actor or actress in the main cast that doesn't steal the show at some point. James Cromwell plays the frustrated Prince Philip wonderfully('Look at them, pulling out their hair and sleeping in the streets for someone they've never even met-- and they call US mad!'). Slyvia Syms provides some delightfully unexpected comedic relief as the Queen Mother. And just as Mirren perfectly embodies Queen Elizabeth, Michael Sheen also does so with Tony Blair, in a great supporting role for which I hope he also gets an Oscar nomination.The Queen much deserves the praise its been getting. It is actually a very surprising film. You may expect a melodrama, but you would be completely wrong. You may expect to not be interested in its politics but they are more accessible than you may initially think. Whether you like the movie or not, though, there is no disputing the greatness of Mirren's performance. I hope she wins an Oscar this year: after the perky blonde winning last year, I think it's time for Mirren to distinguish the line between movie star and accomplished actress and bring home her gold.My rating: 10/10",10,2,3,18 January 2007
The Silence of the Lambs," Shocking psychological thriller
","The Silence of The Lambs explores the life and mind of Clarice Starling, a female FBI agent who has a lot of issues to deal with. Somehow by fate, she ends up meeting Hannibal Lector, and they strike up a very unusual relationship. The most interesting parts in the movie deal with the 2 of them just talking.The highlight of the movie is obviously Anthony Hopkins' performance. He's delightfully creepy as Hannibal. The whole suspense of the character is thinking he's about to do something violent, since throughout the movie you only hear stories about the terrible things he's done. When he finally does do something, it really pays off because it's one of the scariest and most memorable parts in the movie.The Silence Of The Lambs appeals to many people. That's because it can be viewed from so many angles, and that's why it's become a part of our pop-culture. I'm not going to write any longer, because I'm having an old friend for dinner.My rating: 10/10",10,7,14,16 March 2003
Signs," 'Is it possible there are no coincidences?'
","There are plenty of movies that use the idea of aliens invading and attacking earth. Some are good, some are incredibly bad. Signs uses that concept but follows through on it in a way I've never seen before. Instead of showing a bunch of stories like what the president is doing about this, the army fighting the aliens, and showing hundreds of people running and screaming, this movie shows how most people would probably be experiencing this: at home, anxiously watching the news for information. There are plenty of suspenseful scenes that are scary not because of what you see, but because of what you don't see, and what you are afraid to see.Many people love this movie for doing this, others hate it for it. If you're a fan of movies full of alien carnage with creatures biting the heads off people and blowing up cities, Signs may not be for you. But like all of M. Night's films, it still makes a pretty good movie without the main concept. It's actually a pretty touching story about family, faith, and the possibility that there are no coincidences and there is a reason behind everything. That's what makes this movie worth watching over.My rating: 9/10",9,21,40,15 August 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," They saved the best for last
","Obviously, I'm aware of the fact that the Lord of the Rings trilogy is actually one giant movie, but since it was released in parts, that's how I'm judging them. The Return Of The King is the final chapter, and since it is the climax and resolution of the epic journey, it has a little more intensity and urgency than the previous installments.At this point everyone has come to know and love all of the characters, and the stakes have become tremendously high. Kingdoms are at their knees, and the only two characters who can save the day are getting weaker and weaker. The tension was very high in this episode and I can honestly say that out of all 3 this was the only one that had me on the edge of my seat. There were many memorable scenes (one of my favourites including the part with the giant spider)that made this the classic that it is sure to stay for decades to come.This is the longest of the series, mostly because of the ending that seems to last a while. This was a good ending, and I can see why Frodo did what he did. He, and us the audience, have gone through an incredible ordeal and I think we needed that 20 minute linger. When the battle is over, and the celebrations have ended, there is a sad emptiness felt. The films spanned over 3 years, there have been the extended cuts of course, but after that, it's all over. Peter Jackson gave us an ending that was both appropriate and admirable.These were some amazing movies and this one in particular is the best, in my opinion. As whole, the Lord Of The Rings is a phenomenon. An absolute phenomenon. Much more than just movies. They have a universal appeal and have touched the hearts and imaginations of millions. I'm one of them.Sorry if I'm being all fanboyish and kissing this movie's ass, but I really admire it. It may not be among my personal favourites but generally this seems to be the movie event of the century. There will never be another Lord of the Rings film, and that's a bit depressing.My rating: 10/10",10,609,715,16 March 2005
Munich," Butcher's hands, gentle hearts
","The 2005/2006 Oscar race was indeed an odd one, especially when you consider the fact that the winner for Best Documentary made more money than any of the Best Picture Contenders. Combined. Munich, directed by Steven Spielberg, was one of those contenders, though I think it was the least hyped of the 5 films, and no one really expected it to win, and it didn't. But I'm very glad it was nominated, and I'm glad to have seen in while it was playing in theatres, even though it turned out to be a very, very unpleasant experience for me. It's a long movie, and if you take the previews into account, it probably runs for about 3 hours. I never really appreciated how long 3 hours actually is until I went in to see Munich feeling perfectly fine, then halfway through I started to feel cold and shivery, and by the time the film was over, I walked out with a terrible fever and could barely make it home.Now, I could probably make a great endorsement for the movie in my little IMDb comment here and say that Munich is such a wrenching, powerful film that it actually effected me physically, but I know that's not the case. It was winter, there was a flu going around. You know how it is. Anyway, I recently bought the movie and watched it over again, this time with a clear head, and enjoyed it thoroughly. It is one of 2005's best (a great year for movies, by the way), and even though movies about penguins or gay cowboys seemed to capture all the interest and hype, it's still gratifying to see that Munich got its nomination over some other very worthy films. I think that within the next few years, more and more people will discover Munich and wonder why they didn't see it before; it is a movie that will linger for decades and decades to come.It's a very involving film, it is not afraid to give all of the necessary crucial details, from the actual Munich massacre (spread out and shown in segments throughout the entire film) to a scene in a dark conference room where the Prime Minister of Isreal makes the decision to retaliate against those who planned the murders. Most of the story is told through the eyes of Avner (Eric Bana), who takes on the mission out of devotion to Isreal, but slowly numbs with each murder until he doesn't even care about taking the lives anymore; he just wants to get to his home, and see his wife and child, but even when that finally happens the mission has taken such a toll on him that he is constantly paranoid and distraught. He is hailed as a hero for his mission-a hero that never existed- but he feels no sense of accomplishment as the cycles of violence and vengeance continue and escalate while he is helpless, and spiritually broken.Munich is a great film and I'd compare it to something like The Godfather. It's a violent film, but it doesn't just throw senseless and brutal violence at the screen. Much like Coppola, Spielberg gives us little details in the violent scenes to keep them in our minds more vividly. We remember that the first person is assassinated while holding his groceries, and we remember the tense hesitation between the two assassins. We remember that that young girl answers a phone bomb that is meant for her father, and the moment of panic before he is actually murdered. We remember Avner's signal to ignite the bed bomb in the hotel room next to him- the lamp being turned off- and seeing the same lamp moments after the explosion on the floor among all the debris. It's those little compositions that make a film like this so memorable.It's also like The Godfather because of the fact that it holds very familial values. Family is an important theme. Avner comes to dinner with the family of one of his 'business associates' and is treated very much like a son to the character Poppy. He offers him advice and anecdotes, and while he helps him prepare the dinner he notes his big hands and offers a similarity between the two: 'We are tragic men. We have butcher's hands, but gentle hearts.' Avner shows devotion to Isreal, but his most sincere devotion is to his family. That is what makes Avner so likable, but also so tragic. The movie itself is not a tragedy, though it deals with tragedies, but the true tragedy can be found internally- in Avner's moral and spiritual dilemmas.Steven Spielberg is a director who seems to have unlimited talent. I'm always impressed and delighted with each new project he takes on. Munich is another masterpiece that you can add to the list of an almost uncountable selection of masterpieces from one of the best directors of this, or any other time. As the years go by, I'm sure more and more people will look at Munich and think it deserved the Oscar. It's a timeless and brilliant film.My rating: 10/10",10,4,6,20 August 2006
Casino," Feels short for a 3-hour movie...
","Casino is so fast-paced and entertaining, it doesn't even feel like it's 3 hours at all. Fans of Scorsese, DeNiro, and Pesci will love this. They're all at their usual greatness, but the pleasant surprise from this movie is the electrifying performance by Sharon Stone (who won a Golden Globe award and got an Oscar nomination for her role). She's truly the crazy bitch you love to hate.It isn't all too original, it uses the same formulas as other Scorsese movies (particularly Goodfellas), but it just works. It's a fun movie. The camera moves as if it has a life of its own, almost every scene is set to great music, the dialogue and narration are top-notch, and everything is just perfect. What more could you possibly want?It's the closest thing to Goodfellas II, but it still stands on its own very well. Everyone should see this movie. It's 3 hours well spent.My rating: 10/10",10,12,20,2 June 2003
Heat," A brilliant crime saga
","Heat is a movie filled with clichés but as a whole is not clichéd. It has a confidence and skill to its craft that makes you believe that you are seeing this kind of story for the first time, or at least, in a whole new light. It's mainly the story of the obsessed-with-his-cases, badass cop and the professional, by-the-numbers criminal. Michael Mann fleshes out the characters (played by Pacino and DeNiro) extremely well and presents them as two men who are each consumed by their profession. Mostly because they are both very good at what they do, and they would not prefer to do anything else. Each story would make an interesting movie or TV show, but Heat collides these two similar characters together to make a great movie about two skilled men conflicted amidst pressures from their work and personal lives finally meeting their match.What I liked about the connection Pacino and DeNiro build is the fact that their characters truly respected each other. If the movie were bias to either side of the law, one character would be good and the other would be bad. It's not bias at all, and both characters are very likable. It's hard to root for one character over the other, which makes the film's conclusion all the more emotional. And believe me, it has a great ending.The supporting cast is top notch, ranging from Val Kilmer to Ashley Judd to William Fichner to a young Natalie Portman, but the main attraction obviously is Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro in the leads. They're actors who are amazing beyond words, and have acted in so many monumental movies throughout their careers, and I have to say that this was the last truly great, outstanding film that either has starred in to date. Oddly enough, it just so happens it was the same movie.With Heat, Michael Mann tells a sincere and richly detailed story within a subject matter that usually isn't treated with such care, and Pacino and DeNiro perform with their usual greatness, but still offer up new things we haven't seen before. It's one of the best films of the 1990's.My rating: 10/10",10,0,1,13 July 2006
Born on the Fourth of July," 'Like it or leave it'
","Born On The Fourth of July starts out with a young Ron Kovic being very positive about war, doing the right thing, and believing in his country. Very gradually all of his beliefs fade away once he is shot in Vietnam, and is paralyzed, having to spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair. He realizes all the things he's lost because he tried to be a hero, and all the emotional torment he gained because of innocent people he killed.Born On The Fourth of July can be viewed as an anti-war film, but it's mostly about Ron Kovic's struggles dealing with a country that lied to him, being in a wheelchair, having his voice heard, and being redeemed.This is easily Tom Cruise's best performance yet and one of the best movies dealing with the aftermath of the Vietnam war. Oliver Stone proves how great of a director he still is, even after greats like Platoon, Wall Street and Talk Radio. The musical score by John Williams is also incredible, and fits in well with the movie. It's probably one of the best scores I've ever heard.Not everyone will love this movie as much as I do, but you can like it or leave it.My rating: 10/10",10,2,4,14 March 2003
Back to the Future," A Great movie. Not much else to say.
","All the reasons I love this movie have already been said many times here before. Back To The Future is just a generally great movie, it's the best of its kind. It has a great story and everything comes together so perfectly in the end.I saw this movie when I was a little kid and I was sick in the hospital. I felt so bad being sick, but the movie was so great that it made me forget. It's always been close to my heart. I still enjoy watching it now as much as I did then. Oddly enough, it took me almost 10 years to finally get around to watching part II.I picked up the DVD trilogy recently and believe me, it has everything a fan of Back To The Future could possibly ask for.My rating: 10/10",10,2,3,25 August 2003
Goodfellas," Scorsese at his best
","Goodfellas is an all around great movie. If you don't immediately love it, it'll probably grow on you soon enough. Ray Liotta, Lorraine Bracco, and Joe Pesci all give the best performances in their careers and it is arguably Martin Scorsese's best directorial effort. Sure, it's up there among his best with Taxi Driver, Mean Streets, and Raging Bull, but this one just stands out more. I think what makes Goodfellas so great is it's compilation of elements like the acting, storytelling, character development, and dialogue. My One complaint is that Robert DeNiro is not in the movie as much as you'd expect, and I was always left wanting more. But maybe that's a good thing.Goodfellas is an amazing, unforgettable film that everyone should see. If you haven't already had the pleasure of seeing it, go rent it right now. It could just change your life.My Rating: 10/10",10,1,2,30 January 2003
Shark Tale," The cinematic equivalent of fish food
","Okay, so let's pretend for a minute that a wizard or something cast a spell on all of humanity and we were all turned into fish and had to live underwater, but had to cope with it in some way. This new world would look something like the one in Shark Tale. They're fish, but they seem a lot more like people anyway (and most of the characters resemble the actors who provide their voices). It's the same principle as The Flintstones, really, except with a nautical theme instead of a prehistoric one; instead of seeing Ed Sullistone on TV, we see Katie Current. You get it.The movie itself is generally pretty silly. It's not like Finding Nemo, a good family movie that all ages could enjoy, it's aimed more at the kids. It has silly jokes and cheap laughs, but the satire in the plot would most likely go over kids' heads. And even some of the smaller gags will not make any sense, as I really doubt any kids watching this have ever seen A Few Good Men, Jerry Maguire, or, well, actually, some may have seen Gladiator. The boys, at least. But never mind that all. Because it has enough silliness to distract the kids and annoy the adults.The cast is great, I'll admit that. It is definitely the highlight of the movie. Whoever thought of using director Martin Scorsese's voice? He is such a great director, but does have that unique voice, added to the fact that DeNiro, who starred in many of his most popular films, plays a role- I just think it was a great idea. But, that does bring me to a big nitpick of mine: If you had DeNiro and Scorsese together in an animated feature, such as this, wouldn't you want to have their characters interact more? They have only have two scenes together (3 if you count one with their characters talking on the phone- and since it's an animated film with only their voices anyway, why wouldn't you count it?) and they were just stupid. It was kind of like a pathetic, dumbed-down version of the 'Who's on first' thing.I don't really think Shark Tale was a bad movie, but with CGI films increasing and increasing in releases, this will be one that probably won't be remembered as well as some others. It was really just a silly cartoon, and you can't really read too much into it. And it's not a movie you need to devote much attention to. It's sort of the cinematic equivalent of fish food. It keeps the fish alive and everything, but I don't think the fish really rave about the flavour. It works, it's fine, but it doesn't stand out.My rating: 6/10",6,2,3,5 July 2006
The Fighter," Fighting in and out of the ring
","Wow, what a movie. It's an inspirational true story of a boxer finally getting his break. It's also a story of addiction, and how it can affect loved ones. And above all, it's about family. There are some great boxing scenes in THE FIGHTER, they feel authentic and brutal, but the true fight is really outside the ring. Which is not to say this is an overbearing melodrama, no, far from it. It handles the subject matter gracefully. It has a lot of heart and can be quite funny, and there are some humorously absurd moments, something director David O. Russell has proved to be very good at providing.Mark Wahlberg gives a great performance playing the lead character, Micky. This is Wahlberg's most reserved and complex role to date. Micky has an unbreakable devotion to his family, which both strengthens and cripples him. He never really speaks for himself, and would rather suffer than upset those around him. Through the course of the movie the character really grows, thanks to the help of a good woman by his side. Mark Wahlberg shows a side of himself we've never seen before, this isn't the over-the-top badass THE DEPARTED Wahlberg, which don't get me wrong, is awesome too, but he finds a different range here. Truly the guy has come a long way from The Funky Bunch.Christian Bale is absolutely phenomenal in his scene-stealing role as Micky's drug-addicted brother. This is such a great character that Bale really brings a lot of depth to. Dicky's easily angered, often detached and oblivious to how his affliction is affecting his life. He's also ashamed and vulnerable. He's not the most reliable guy in the world and he's in need of a serious wake-up call. But the thing is...you can completely understand why Micky would stand by him for so long. Underneath it all, he really is a great guy, full of energy and affection- somebody you'd really want in your corner. This is sure to go down as one of Bale's most remembered roles, and hopefully his enormous talent will finally be recognized by winning an Academy Award for it.Behind every great man is a great woman, and Amy Adams also delivers a fantastic performance as Micky's girlfriend, who really helps him develop some backbone and at the same time is able to find some clarity in her misguided life. She's great in her role, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't thoroughly enjoy the eye-candy she brings to the movie. She has her fair share of revealing outfits and in one scene is shown wearing a see-through bra. Now THAT'S great filmmaking! Also notable, just because it stood out to me, is that Conan O'Brien's sister, Kate, has a role in the movie, playing one of Micky's sisters. I sort of wish I wasn't privy to this information before seeing it because her resemblance to the goofy talk show host is uncanny...and a little disturbing.I don't know why a lot of the most involving sports movies happen to be about boxing, I guess there's just something so primal and against all logic about people that get the crap beaten out of them for a living. It's worth knowing what makes these people tick. Yes, this is based on a true story, but I'm sure it's been tailored to fit Hollywood needs. Events have likely been rearranged and certain moments probably fabricated or altered, but THE FIGHTER doesn't attempt to portray the family shown here in a completely positive light. Nobody is a saint here, and everyone has their faults. When it finally arrives at its conclusion it is relieving, satisfying, and yes, inspiring. This is ultimately a happy story well deserving to be told on film but the sad reality is that there are no doubt hundreds and hundreds of similar stories that didn't end up quite as well. I can't tell you what exactly makes the family depicted in this movie so special. Maybe they're stronger, and more willing to compromise, and just maybe a little lucky, too. But I was left recalling a scene from the movie THE STRAIGHT STORY, where Richard Farnsworth lays down some wisdom upon a teenage runaway: he told her how he would give each of his kids a stick and ask them to snap them, which was easy. Then he'd give them a whole bundle, which couldn't be broken. 'That's family.'",10,66,100,17 December 2010
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," A great musical comedy
","One thing that makes O Brother, Where Art Thou stand out is its incredible soundtrack. It's probably one of the most popular soundtracks since Saturday Night Fever. 'Man of Constant Sorrow' is one particular song that sticks in your head. Other than the great music, there are many funny scenes and all the characters are very likable. O Brother is loosely based on Homer's Oddysey, but I thought they didn't need that to tie in with the story. 3 convicts on the run from the law is good enough. That would be my only complaint about it. Some people are always complaining how unrealistic George Clooney's perfectly straight and white teeth are. But really....who cares?All in all, this is one damn entertaining movie. George Clooney (in his Golden Globe winning performance) proves just how great an actor he is.My rating: 9/10",9,1,2,16 March 2003
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Will Ferrell: hilarious as always
","I saw Talledega Nights: The Ballad Of Ricky Bobby last night. I was in need of a good laugh, and the flick certainly delivered. As usual, Will Ferrell is unbelievably funny and the main attraction. The actual movie, however, was fairly mediocre.It feels very fractured; as if there's enough deleted scenes to make an entirely different movie (as the case was with Wake Up Ron Burgundy). I also get the feeling that they left out many funny moments to tell the tale of a man who was destined to go fast, got too cocky, and learned some valuable life lessons blah, blah, blah. I hate to say it, but it almost feels like something Happy Madison productions would dish out. Honestly, if it were not for Will Ferrell, if, say, Rob Schnieder or David Spade was in the lead, I probably would have hated this movie. But because Ferrell is so damn lovable, and because the movie had its share of funny moments and very quotable lines, I liked it. You can already tell by some of the career moves he has been making (many have been flying under the radar), Will Ferrell is slowly gearing towards an image that is more than just the lovable, hilarious idiot. And I think that just establishes him further as a kind of America's Sweetheart type.John C Rielly is also worth pointing out. He's a great actor, but he seems to be at most ease when he's playing a buffoon. And his character here is about as big of a buffoon as you can imagine.None of the other actors have many laughs, unfortunately. Sacha Cohen got a little irritating after a while, and every other talent is wasted. Michael Clarke Duncan. They have Michael Clarke Duncan in the damn movie and they don't do a single funny thing with him. Imagine what they could have done with him! Instead, his only laugh comes literally once the movie is over, in a blooper. David Koechner is also in the movie but he merely lingers around like a ghost. He had one scene in The 40-Year-Old Virgin, and that made a more lasting impression than the couple of scenes he had in this one. There's also some cameos, of two famous singers who normally would not associate with each other (I guess that's as far as the joke goes), and they do nothing. They just sit there and don't say a word.So, put that all together and your main reason to see this movie is Will and John: Shake and Bake. There are big laughs here and there, and some great great lines (the crack dealer line, the highlander line, the big red advertisement, pissing excellence, are some that stood out for me) but I guess when they edited the movie they wanted a plot. And that takes the fun out of it. It's painfully formulaic, and even many of the jokes are predictable, too. There's a kiss scene at the end that you can see coming from miles away. Sure, you can't really believe it (in a good, funny way), but you could anticipate it. Ferrell's other movies like Anchorman or Old School were in their own ways unpredictable, or at least, less predictable than this. It makes a comedy so much funnier if you don't know where it's headed from the second it starts. Anchorman barely had a plot and it turned out amazing because of that. There was more room for the funny stuff. Male Chauvanism. Panda Bears. That's all the plot I need.If Will Ferrell and director Adam McKay collaborate for another comedy, I hope to see two things: A longer title and a thinner plot.My rating: 6.5/10",6,6,13,14 August 2006
