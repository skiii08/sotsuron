Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," If you enjoyed the book, you'll find it impossible to enjoy this film.
","I knew once I completed this book a few months ago that there was no way this movie could possibly be long enough to portray the wonderful story that Seth Grahame-Smith put together. But I was hopeful that it would at least contain some of the best scenes from the novel. It did not. In fact, outside of the title & a few of the characters, this is not the same story at all.Even if you were to ignore the fact that this was such a poor adaptation, I'm not sure how so many people have given this movie a positive review. Add the many clich√©s to the sometimes very poor acting & the very rushed pace of the story, & you get a movie that's FAR from worth the price of admission.It's such a shame, really. This movie is just a reminder that outside of J.K. Rowling, not many authors get the pleasure of seeing their words painted even half as beautifully on the big screen as they were on those thin pieces of paper.",1,10,22,22 June 2012
