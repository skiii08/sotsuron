War Dogs," Filmed in Romania, but they say Albania
","Awful movie, awful acting, awful script. It's a combination of nothing. At first sight I thought it's some sort of a comedy-action movie like 21 Street, but boy I was wrong. It's exactly what it says in the IMDb description: 'Comedy, Drama, Crime', but has very little of these three categories and final result is awful.Above all that the movie is filmed in Bucharest, Romania, but they say it's Albania. Albania is NOT Romania. It's an insult to my country, Romania. I bet Americans will hate it if I am to make a movie in Canada and said it's America. Please don't make movies like this anymore, it left me with a bitter taste forever after.",1,11,30,12 November 2016
