The New World," Such a low rating :/
","...Yea I was expecting a high rating for this film but... The reason of a low rating is that some of you, have voted as - awful. First to user - stelea: Your suggestions are no better than this film. a film studies teacher you say? Yes some think that's enough to judge films, I say It's not nearly enough. To user - gryffindor249: Cop Out is a dumb film :D ...Well, maybe it's not a great film, but everything's comparative... Matter of taste of course and there's nothing I can change in people's mind :) And then there are so many 1 star reviews following each other that it really looks like an organized downrate movement: 'Hey, this film is a crap, so let us all downrate it, because I hate it,' 'or it so happens that so many people are addicted to a Hollywood crap films ('I can't stand a boring films like this, let us watch Transformers' - it really happens you know), or a user having this excellent idea of creating many profiles to downrate this film... All I know is this film really doesn't deserve the rating it has, so could anyone tell me what could possibly be the matter :( PS: The highest rated film is 'The Shawshank Redemption' (at given moment) and it's a total crap considering it's a Stephen King's novel shot in the most common way, absolutely no Artistism in it. but then again, I can't recall any Art film being top rated :X",9,0,2,6 October 2013
