Scarface," Deserves More Credit Much More
",If you haven't seen Scarface then stop reading this review and go out and watch it. I don't care who you are even if you're the wholesome kid next door who listens to nothing but folk and gospel. Get out of your house right now and get a copy of this film. I'm not a 'gangsta' but to this still is one of the best films today. Pit it against any new film out today and Scarface wins hands down.Now time for the review; Scarface as you know is the story of a Cuban exile that is sent to America. His name is Tony Montana. He is an ambitious man with a very troubled past hence why he was exiled. He takes the 'American Dream' to the next level. He has a partner with him the whole way named Manny the two starts out as low level gangsters and become the tow biggest drug kingpins in the world. With that said let me tell you why Scarface is a great movie. Scarface is not just a shoot em up gangster movie it actually shows the good and the bad sides to being a gangster. And this film shows both sides not like others who only focus on the bad this film put just as much emphasis on the good side to doing wrong as the bad side. So we have your basic rag to riches story with one catch. Montana is a man so firmly in his principles that he won't let anyone compromise them. We see this from the beginning till the bitter end. Along the way we meet some good supporting characters but this movie is basically AL Pachino's movie. I've seen a lot of AL Pachino's work and a lot of it is good but none of his films come close to Scarface except for the Godfather trilogy and their about equal there. So clearly many people might gasp at the fact that this film is very violent well Oliver Stone did real research and found out that all the violence in this film is plausible. If you take the time to think about it if your were on drugs 24 hours a day and made massive amounts of money selling drugs your going to have to spill blood. The reason this movie truly stands out among other gangster movies is that it gives the audience a chance to see the life of a drug kingpin and one whose one bad a** mother Fu****,10,1,2,8 October 2003
Training Day," Perfect (try to top that people)
","I watched this movie 4 times. I received the bootleg cut from a friend and I saw it in the theaters. And twice, since I own the DVD. This is the best cop movie I have seen in a while. I mean fans of this drama have to appreciate the gritty reality in this film. The movie has parts that one could call 'Hollywood' however those only add points to the film. I want to point out that you must have massive head trauma or be in born in another country to know that Denzel Washington not only played a realistic corrupt cop but it seemed like it was second nature for him. Looking back at this film I can see nothing flawed about maybe I mean not to be redundant but there are very few films that really make you feel gratitude at the end. I don't know if you haven't ever seen Training Day go out and watch this movie...",Null,0,11,25 September 2003
Ocean's Twelve," Not as bad as people say
","OK so this isn't Soderbergh's best movie, give the guy a break he made this movie just to have fun.So now that I have said that Ocean 12 is a movie that is neither good nor bad its a movie that one can watch once and forget. I have to admit being disappointed with the film but I really like Ocean 11 its on of my guilty pleasures. I want to start out with the flaws, the story no one like a movie that has a hard to follow story. i mean its not suppose to be confusing the story was originally written for John Woo. What really got me angry was the fact that it seemed all over the place and seemed to shift focus away from the movie the first movie had a pretty simple story o follow and I really wished they had come up with a better why to portray the life of the Chinese acrobat. Besides the obvious flay their is a savory in this film its the fact that the cast seems to have a chemistry that cannot be foiled by the story. I mean everyone seems ready for action however I wish we got to see more of Bernie mac he really stills the film in the first one. the thing that really got me mad was the fact that the chemistry in the first movie was predominately seen between the guys not Tess, Tess was more of secondary character and she really faded into the background in the first film in this film they attempt to give her a dimension in the story that seems to take away from the film. I didn't want to be disappointed with Ocean 12 but when you have too much fun on set thats what happens. If you want to see a movie that fun then go see the first one. Ocean 12 has one thing going for it that most movie will never have the ability to draw you in if you just were to see one scene see the break dancing scenes the cuts of break dancing and the scene in which Cassels break dances through the lasers one of the b boy scenes I have seen in years and the song is awesome something you could bust a wind mill to then smoke some hookah.Ocean's 12 gets C (average not bad or good)",Null,0,1,27 April 2005
The Village," What can I see... Skip it
","Let me start off by saying I like The Sixth Sense it was a good movie even if you knew the secret it was still a good movie. The story was built on character development and good development of plot. The Village however lacked everything. Let me start out by saying that this movie is a knock off of another story written about 3 years ago and you know what that story was dumb then and its dumb now. I hated this film from the beginning. When I think of a guy whose name utters 'one trick pony' M. Night Shyamalan, I mean come on people the guy needs to stop making this boring 'thrillers' and try to branch out not every movie can have an 'exciting twist' to it. So the film follows a bunch of people living in an isolated village, (that doesn't seem to be from any time period) hmm... I wonder what could be going on just from that comment any one with half a brain can guess this plot I watched the film for 5 minutes and I new how this one was going to end. The work seemed to lack the flare that Shyamalan had in the Sixth Sense it also seemed to be on of his most boring films yet. He doesn't even really give the audience a chance to get to know or like the characters. Right off the bat we see that a child has died because the 'Village lacks medication' that can save the boys life and we are supposed to pity these poor folks, come on now, Plus we meet the boring cast of characters the first one I'll call THE CYBORG aka Joaquin Phoenix if there was a film about a guy with no emotions and seems to play it off very well it would star Joaquin Phoenix and Keanu Reeves geez can any one say WOOD. He gives his performance with almost no incentive its like hi I'm here where my paycheck and Joaquin Phoenix is a pretty good actor in other films like Buffalo Soldiers and Quills but his performance seemed wooden. The there's the 'Mentally Challenged Character' sorry Brody but I'm not even going to point out how you ruined this one 'one hint though there a difference between being mentally challenged and being stupid and Brody performance was stupid. Adding shame to the handicap is the 'blind girl' who the audience is supposed to pity THE only pity I had for her was that she was in this movie. The movie seemed to trudge on and on and on. At one point we are seeing one of the lamest wedding sequences I have ever seen the next moment we see a character stabbed I mean if you wanted to steal someone else story at least steal a good one. The next person who deserves the (Holy crap you bored the audience to death award) would be William Hurt (Mr. Gonzo himself) he seems to be bored out of his mind to the point where he doesn't even care about the movie he like a talking prop through out the film. There a moment in the film when the audience is supposed to feel bad for Kitty walker whose just been dumped as she confesses true love. I couldn't help but laugh then I notice the entire audience was laughing that called bad storytelling I mean when someone tries to hard for one of those 'hall mark' moments it seems to be another gag on the blooper reel Shyamalan. So I hope you all enjoy The Garbage I mean Village because all you stuck in the I'm a Bi+ch to the blockbuster need to get out and expand your mind. *out****",1,11,23,3 March 2005
A Clockwork Orange," Watch It Live it Love it
","A film of this caliber come only once and a while and you know what I know I not the first person who has ever said this but A Clockwork Orange is the most though provoking and brilliant films ever made. Forget what other people saw this movie was way of ahead of its time. The author of this book Burgess did a good job of creating the idea but the vision that he saw and the vision that Kubrick saw are two different things I won't get into that but who cares the movie was awesome. I remember being 14 and seeing this movie as one of the trivia answers at the cinema I then saw it at blockbuster. I read the box and was amazed. I read the book first because I anted to make sure it didn't have any graphic depiction of rape since I don't like to see that in films. Then I did research every day I looked up Clock work Orange at school and every day I read articles about it on the net. This movie was how I found IMDB. Then I rented the movie I watched it three times in a row and sat their wondering why did I wait so long to see this film. I swear this movie makes me feel so alive and vibrant. I swear everyone faces Alex's struggles maybe not to the extremes as he did but I mean when we really look at our lives we do repress the true things we want to do not Alex he shows two extremes one is pure evil finding enjoyment in violence, suffering then we have him become the victim forced to see the error in his ways even though many people will disagree I was glad at the movie ending the book ending the so called extra chapter is kind of stupid. This film should be #1 on IMDB top 250 list and I don't care what anyone says.",10,0,0,25 September 2003
