Hereditary," Save youself 2 hours of your life
",Of the 2 hours of this movie at least half of it was the lead actress freaking out and hyperventilating. The ending was so bad that I got the impression that they ran out of money and had to wrap it up.,1,1,5,27 August 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Consider the Star Wars saga to have ended with Return of the Jedi
","The Last Jedi is a spectacular visual film but in term of living up to the awe inspiring Star Wars mythology Rian Johnson failed dismally particularly because he didn't try. Star Wars has been a part of pop culture for the last 40 years and as I tell my not so enthusiastic wife I know it's not real but it's so much fun to immerse yourself into the fantasy and culture.The Force Awakens raised some interesting questions that fans were left to ponder and have fun debating...Who is Snoke and where did he come from? 
How did he get control of The First Order? 
Who were Rey's parents?
What happened to Luke?Rian Johnons answers to all of these questions were simply that they don't matter. It's all about Kylo Ren who has nowhere near the power and presence of Palpatine, Vader or Snoke and is nowhere near as capable of finishing what his grandfather 'started'.It was so sad to see Snoke and Phasma (who had her own origin book) stuffed out like flies and the hero of the original trilogy reduced to a bitter old man who contemplated killing his own nephew. Perhaps he was influenced through the force by Snoke to help turn Ben Solo to the Dark side but Rian Johnson will probably tell as that it also doesn't matter.Rian Johnson should not be allowed near a Star Wars script again and my advice to die hard Star Wars fans is to see it, enjoy it and buy it to add to your collection, but consider the Star Wars saga to have ended with Return Of The Jedi.",1,1,1,2 January 2018
