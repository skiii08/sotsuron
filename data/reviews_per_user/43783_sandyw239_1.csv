Angels & Demons," Growling Constipation
","I think after the first one, this is just disappointing. The Da Vinci Code introduced the Chevaliers de Sangreal, the premise of clues hidden within the church, and an Christian-like alternative to National Treasure. Albeit controversial, still interesting. The second one doesn't incite any emotional bearing whatsoever. Any good action film like James Bond or National Treasure, in movieland -you gotta change paces and move from town to town -globe trotter! This premise is set within the Vatican, which I find boring. I half expected Anne Hathaway's boyfriend to appear.Furthermore, Tom Hanks' acting is less than superior. His voice is low, rich in a bad way -like very sticky molasses that's trailing mud. His eyebrows furrowed at everything. The writing was just awful. Everyone knows movies are usually scripted, but you don't notice it when you're watching it. But this one -as the lines are delivered -it's so blatant that those lines are written.The twist at the end wasn't very good, as it wasn't dramatic or revealed in an OMG-way.Cinematography -too much looking at them run, or looking at where they're running. Overview shots of city scenery was good though.The only thing I enjoyed was that they included the concept of the Illuminati, which wasn't developed 'cuz you'll realize it's all bogus anyway. I loved the particle accelerator creating antimatter since they've been trying to do that for years, and if it was reality -may i say HOLY S***.PS -Peeved that Langdon just HAD to be stationed at the clich√© Harvard University.All in all, nothing overly enjoyable, since you pretty much know what's going to happen. The story isn't developed well, nor do the actors make it interesting. I expect better from Tom Hanks and Ron Howard.",5,8,21,15 May 2009
