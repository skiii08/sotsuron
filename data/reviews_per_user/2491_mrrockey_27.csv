Unbreakable," A Unique and Interesting Take on the Superhero Origin Story
","Superhero movies, what can you say about them? Every year, we see at least one of them and every time they come out, it's money in the bank for the studios. But with how popular the genre has become, one film that's often overlooked in the genre is M. Night Shyamalan's Unbreakable. Which is sad because this is actually one of the more thought-provoking and unique films in the genre. So why do so few people talk about this movie after all these years? Let's find out.Plot: David Dunn is a security guard who becomes the sole survivor of a train accident with no sustained injuries whatsoever. After surviving the train accident, David receives a mysterious note asking him the question 'How many times have you been sick?' and from then on, he embarks on a journey with Elijah Price, a comic-book historian and museum owner who suffers from Osteogenesis Imperfecta, a disease that causes the patient's bones to be extremely brittle, to discover that David may be, a superhuman.The thing that surprised me about this film is how it has its own mythology and how believable and unique it is. This film has the idea that comic-books are basically representations of real-life but that they've been commercialized so they lost some of that truth but the essence is still there. People may not be able to see through walls or shoot fire out of their hands in real-life but people DO have extraordinary abilities that seem out of this world such as David's ability to never be injured or his ability to tell bad deeds someone's done simply by touching their hand. There's a lot of films made about the idea of having a superhero in real-life such as Kick-Ass and Super but I've never seen a film before that suggests comic-books to be real. Also, while the idea of a man being 'unbreakable' and able to tell someone's bad deeds just by touching their hand would seem very silly if it was done in the traditional, Hollywood blockbuster way where we would see David do all sorts of crazy stuff with CGI and stuff, Shayamalan presents this idea in a believable, realistic fashion. David in this movie is certainly not a regular human being, but at the same time, his powers are JUST down-to-earth enough for us to buy that someone could possibly possess these powers in real- life. It's a remarkable achievement for a film to make me believe that a guy could possibly possess superpowers in real-life.There's also lot of philosophy and questions raised in this film. This movie features the idea of destiny in that we're all meant to follow a certain path in life whether we want to or not and it's quite fascinating. This movie features the 'born to be the hero' archetype in David with him destined to be a superhero but it also features the OTHER side of the spectrum, the man born to be the villain, Elijah Price A.K.A Mr. Glass. The concept about a man being destined to become a hero is obviously not anything new as we've seen it all throughout film and literature but what makes this different is that this movie doesn't quite present it as simply 'Destiny is good, you are meant for great things!'. It challenges us by asking 'What if you are born a villain?', and this is a great, FASCINATING topic that this movie thankfully delves into quite a lot. It makes you question 'Is evil born, or is it created?'. And while there a bunch of different ways to look at this film, in my eyes, it's both. Mr. Glass in this film is born with Osteogenesis Imperfecta, which causes him to feel lonely and lost as he struggles to find his place in the world but when he finds out he's meant to be the yang to David's yin, he finally knows who he is and why he's born the way he was. While it's not exactly a comforting thing to know, he at least finally knows his place in the world. But on the other hand, it's CREATED because it was Elijah's desperation that led to him to his quest where he initiated acts of terrorism just to find his opposite, David.Now, let's talk about the acting and the directing. I'll just talk about Willis and Jackson since this film is really just about them. Bruce Willis is excellent here as David. He plays David as someone who is simply lost as to who he is life and who's feeling this constant sadness with that he can't explain and Willis'soft-spoken, brooding personality fits very well into this character. Samuel plays Elijah as a very determined and philosophical figure. He delivers all of his lines with a presence of authority and Sam's voice really convinces you what he's saying, is true. His best scene is towards the end where he breaks down in tears from finding out who he is and this is a very tricky scene for any actor to act out because his character is feeling a lot of different emotions at the same time. But Sam really sells this scene and makes it a really powerful moment in the film.Shyamalan surprisingly did a very good job directing this film. He gives this film a slow, unsettling mood and it makes the film all the more engaging and interesting as it makes it feel very unpredictable. He used a lot of takes that go on for a really long time and that really helps you get into what the actors are saying for some reason. But one minor thing that bugged me about his direction was his constant use of upside- down shots. I don't know, I just found them sort of distracting.Overall, the unique mythology, fascinating philosophy, solid acting, and engaging direction all add up to one of the most captivating superhero films ever made. 10/10",8,0,0,11 February 2014
Fight Club," An Intelligent Film that Definitely Deserves a Rewatch
","Fight Club is one of the smartest films I've seen in a long time. The title is a little misleading. It makes the film sound like nothing more than a dumb testosterone flick but in actuality, it's a thrilling, intense look at masculinity and individuality.The story of this film is that of a unhappy, lonely man who works as an automobile company employee and is only referred to in the film as 'The Narrator'. He's not enjoying his job, he has insomnia, and he has to go to support groups just to be able to sleep. His life pretty much sucks until he meets Tyler Durden, who is the embodiment of everything the Narrator wishes to be. He's cool, laidback, dresses like a movie star, has a buff body, and most of all, free from consumerism. They quickly form a friendship and one night, they fought each other just for the heck of it and ended up really enjoying so they form a fight club for men to take out their frustrations with their fists. The club gets more and more members overtime so Tyler comes up with 'Project Mayhem', a plan to bomb buildings with credit card companies'recordings.What makes this film so great is how both inviting and disturbing it is. At first, when The Narrator meets Tyler Durden, we see and understand their problems with society because it's actually a very common frustration normal people have. Because of this, it allows us to at least understand where these people are coming from and be able to sitback and enjoy the first half until the second half comes along and gets really freaking dark and intense.The second half is when it gets dark and disturbing. Instead of them just beating the sh!t out of each other in a basement, they decide to freaking blow up buildings! At this point, you could either be completely disgusted with their behavior, or disagree with their methods but still understand their position, or completely agree with everything they do(minority). But whether or not you agree with their behavior, you still feel sympathy towards the Narrator because he's just a normal guy who happened to have a messed up mental conditioning and he's never EVIL in this movie, he's just frustrated in a lifestyle he doesn't enjoy. So this movie does get pretty darn intense because you care for him.The directing and acting in this film is superb! David Fincher is considered to be one of the greatest filmmakers of our time and he definitely lives up to the hype in this movie! The way he uses narration, quick-cuts, and CGI-animated sequences is amazing! He makes the audience feel just as lost and confused as The Narrator does in this film because of these things and a mediocre director would've just played generic 'suspenseful music' but Fincher adds style and panache to what could have been just a generic psychological thriller.Everyone does a solid job in this movie. From Edward Norton playing his role with cynicism and frustration, to Brad Pitt making Tyler Durden a surprisingly likable and charming character that is both cool and terrifying, and Helena Bonham Carter who makes her character quirky and kinda funny. All in all, the acting in this film is great!Lastly, this film brings up a lot of thought-provoking questions. Can you actually be your own man in a world this corporate? Do people really need to be 'freed' from their jobs such as construction workers, waiters, cooks, taxi drivers, and teachers to do their own thing? And is there such thing as true freedom? These are all really thought-provoking questions and you'll definitely be thinking about these things after watching this film.Overall, this is an intelligent, intense film that really makes us think about our positions in life and because of that, I'm gonna give it a 10/10.",9,0,1,9 September 2013
Spider-Man 2," One of my Favorite Movies!
","I am gonna get this out of the way. I fricking love this movie! To me, this is the definitive light-hearted superhero movie. It works both as a summer blockbuster and as a sincere, human drama. But why is it so good? Let's take a look and find out!Firstly, the story. While the first Spider-Man was a simple story about a young man who gets super powers and learning to be responsible with them, this film is a lot more complex than that. In this film, Peter is dealing with the struggles of being Spider-Man and having a normal life. Ultimately, his life becomes miserable for him. He can't get a steady job, he's failing his class, he can't pay his rent, and most importantly, he can't get into a relationship with Mary Jane. So he quits being Spider-Man and things start going better for him. He's getting good grades in his class and he can pursue a relationship with Mary Jane. But whenever he sees a crime in progress, he feels really guilty that he can't do anything about it and has to turn the other cheek. Eventually, he becomes Spider-Man again and saves the day and as reward, he gets a chance to be with Mary Jane.What's great about this is that it all feels very human and relatable. We've all been in positions where we want to do something good but isn't getting much out of it. Peter in this film ultimately learns to become Spider-Man again but not because of guilt like in the first film, but because of the responsibility Uncle Ben taught him. It's all very real and human.The villain here is Doc Ock. When this movie first came out, critics raved about how human and sympathetic his character was and I agree completely. He isn't some kind of generic super villain who wants revenge on Spidey or some stupid sh!t like that. He's just a man who lost his wife so the only thing he has to live for is his science experiment. Of course, along the way he does some pretty horrible stuff for this experiment but at the end of the film when Peter tells him what he said to him about intelligence and how it's a gift to be used for the good of mankind. He also tells him how sometimes we have to be steady and give up the thing we want the most. So Doc Ock decides to sacrifice himself at the end to save the city from his experiment. The key theme of this movie is sacrifice and it's expressed beautifully with both the hero and the villain.So there's some really excellent character stuff in this movie but what else is great about it? I think the tone of this movie is perfect. This movie deals with a lot of heavy themes like responsibility, sacrifice, heroism, etc but the tone of this movie never feels too depressing or brooding. It was a huge problem I had with Man of Steel but here, the tone is rather light-hearted and humorous. There's a lot of clever humor in this film that makes the film a really good summer movie experience. I also love the way they made Peter in the beginning of the film. They make him so ridiculously miserable, it's hilarious! It makes the audience sympathize with him well because of how funny it gets. If it was done in a really sappy, tragic way then it would look melodramatic but thankfully, Raimi chose to play it as much for laughs as it is for drama. So you can laugh but still sympathize with Peter in this film.The action scenes in this movie are pretty great too. The one that everyone raves over is the train fight and I agree. The fight choreography here is really quite creative and they take advantage well of all the things Spidey and Ock could do. Overall, Spider-Man 2 is simply one of the best superhero movies out there. It's sincere, it's human, it's funny, it's exciting, and it's surprisingly complex so I am gonna give it a 10/10!",10,10,15,10 August 2013
Batman Returns," Uneven Storytelling with Great Visuals and a Strong Cast
","Batman Returns is an interesting one. It was the second film in the Burton/Schumacher franchise that upon release, scared the crap out of the kids in the audience because of its grotesque, violent imagery and made parents feel uncomfortable letting their kids see it because of the overt sexual innuendo between Batman and Catwoman. Fans seem to generally love it, or hate it. But despite the reputation it held, I still loved this movie as a child. Yes, there were moments that just flat out puzzled me but I still enjoyed it none the less. But as I grow up and mature a little, I see more and more of why this film gets such a mixed reception from the fans. It has some great ideas in there but they just don't quite feel complete in their executions. But does Batman Returns still work as a film? Let's find out!The plot starts off with Oswald Cobblepot, the infant son of the wealthy Cobblepot family who's born with strange birth defects that make him seem half-man, half-penguin. After eating their house cat, the Cobblepots throw him down to the sewers where he gets raised by penguins. 33 years later, Cobblepot sends his circus gang to attack a corrupt business man by the name of Max Shreck's Christmas festivity where he ends up capturing Max Shreck and threatens to reveal his past sins if he doesn't try to get him back into society. Meanwhile, a shy, socially awkward secretary by the name of Selina Kyle, stumbles upon Shreck's evil schemes and gets pushed out a window for it. After getting resurrected by cats, she goes through a mental breakdown where she smashes up her apartment and takes on her new identity as Catwoman. At the same time, the Penguin fools everybody into thinking he saved the Mayor's baby and runs an election to become Mayor.Firstly, I'm gonna talk about why do I think so many people love this movie, the style and atmosphere. Like most of Burton's films, this film has this Gothic, moody atmosphere to it that makes it a very fun movie to watch. The production design is stylized and expressionistic, the score is haunting and beautiful, and the sense of humor is macabre and dark. All this makes for a very appealing movie for both the eyes and ears.But while the atmosphere is great, the storyline is somewhat lost and confused. There's a lot of really cool concepts in this film, but they never seem fully realized and the script ends up suffering because of it. For example, there's the concept of Batman, Penguin, and the Catwoman all being the same deep down as they're all outsiders who put on a different facade to unleash their anger on the thing the thing causes them pain(Batman = crime, Catwoman = women being considered second to men, Penguin = discrimination towards him because of his deformity) but this concept is only brought up towards the end and it feels sorta like an afterthought. They also try to make us sympathize for the villains(with the exception of Max Shreck) which I never did because frankly, they don't come across very redeemable. They just came across as violent douchebags the entire time to me, especially the Penguin, who, even when accepted back into society, STILL decides to get revenge on them and never shows any sign of humanity whatsoever.But at the same time, Burton comes up with a lot of really great images with these characters. There's so many images in this movie that could easily pass off as a painting and there's some even some really subtle symbolism I've noticed after re-watching it. All this makes me wonder if this movie would've worked better had it been its own art-house film with no relation to Batman whatsoever. And it probably would, as Burton doesn't show a whole lot of interest in Batman anyways since all of the villains'origins were changed drastically from the comics and Batman himself is largely overshadowed by the villains in this film.Despite those problems, the cast is still great. Tim Burton may not be the world's greatest storyteller, but he's always been able to get good performances out of his actors and this film is no exception. While Michael Keaton doesn't get as much screen time as expected, he still gave a solid performance as both Batman and Bruce Wayne. The casting of Devito is pure genius and I can't imagine anyone else playing the part. And Pfeiffer adds a surprising amount of depth and nuance to her character. But for me, the biggest scene stealer is Christopher Walken as Max Shreck. He's just fascinating to watch as this corrupt, shady businessman who always come across very mysterious and you never know what exactly he's thinking. I want to see more of this guy.I also thought this movie was quite entertaining. The black humor throughout was funny. While it may be too grotesque for a Batman movie, the twisted atmosphere made it all the more interesting to watch as you don't quite know what Burton's gonna throw at you next. The action sequences were okay for the most part, but there were some memorable moments such as when the Penguin hijacks the Batmobile or the final confrontation between him and Batman.Overall, while it's not a storytelling masterpiece, the stylish visuals and the excellent cast still make for a very entertaining film. But if you are a fan of the comics, you should probably avoid this one as it is mostly a Tim Burton movie and not really much of a Batman movie. I'm gonna give it a 6/10.",6,2,4,18 February 2014
Terminator Salvation," Just Like a Machine, Technically Well Made, but Heartless
","I remember watching Terminator Salvation right when it came out with the film leaving me very cold and empty after watching it. I didn't hate it, didn't love it, it just left me cold. After revisiting this film a few days ago, things haven't changed.Plot: In 2003, death row inmate Marcus Wright signs his body over to Cyberdyne Systems for medical research after execution. A year later, Skynet becomes self-aware and destroys much of humanity. 14 years later, John Connor discovers human prisoners and schematics for a new type of Terminator yet to be known to him. Meanwhile, Marcus suddenly wakes up and finds himself lost with no idea what happened to him but meets a young Kyle Reese and a mute little girl, Star. After hearing a radio broadcast from John, they go together to try to find him but Kyle and Star end up getting captured by Skynet, so Marcus ends up going instead with a resistance fighter by the name of Blair. But when they get there, Marcus accidentally steps on a mine and gets smoked but survives due to having robot parts inside him, he didn't know he had before.The first big problem with Terminator Salvation is the story. It seems like the writers have no idea how to progress John's character, or expand the mythology of the Terminator universe. John Connor in this movie basically has NO development whatsoever. All he does is deliver exposition about the plot and occasionally get into an action scene. He basically has no place in this movie's script whatsoever other than that he's John Connor, so the audience expects to see him. The plot itself also feels like filler, without much of a point to the overall outcome of the series. It's like the writers have no idea what to do after T3 so they just said 'Eh, who cares, let's just write a story that has little to no consequence so we can continue to write more of these and make a bajillion dollars.' The best example of this is the 30 minutes of the film where they discover a radio signal that can shut down Skynet's machines but midway through the film, they... never bring it up again. If you want to follow the mythology of the Terminator series, missing this film wouldn't be that big of a deal.The characters and the actors playing them in this movie are a mixed bag. Christian Bale just plays John Connor as a generic action hero, while speaking in his trademark Batman voice. He doesn't have much personality beyond that, he's just really bland. The only moment where he gets to shine is when he delivers a speech at the end. Marcus is supposed to be the emotional center of the film as he's the character who goes through the biggest arc but the problem is, Marcus is really unlikable. I'm not sure should I blame the script for this, or Sam Worthington's performance but either way, Marcus just came across as a huge douche the way he constantly shouts at people around him for no good reason and generally acting like a prick. I actually wanted to see Arnold rip his heart out, THAT'S how unlikable he was. Moon Bloodgood did a fine job as Blair Williams, even if she looked a little too clean and model-ish to be a soldier. But the best character has to be the young Kyle Reese, played by Anton Yelchin. I really BELIEVED this guy to be the younger version of the hero of the first film, Yelchin did a spectacular job mimicking Biehn's mannerisms but also playing his character differently enough to convince us that he's a younger version.The tone of the movie is another problem. While I like how much more SERIOUS this film felt when compared to T3, which felt too jokey and almost like a PARODY of Terminator at some points, they also go way too far with it and end up creating a really dull film. No matter what kind of movie you're making, you need moments of humor and emotion in your film to make it feel real but this film just had this constant moody tone to it that made it feel as inhuman as the robots in the film. There's practically never a moment for you to take back and laugh a little and there's not a whole lot of human emotion felt in this film. Compare that to the first two films which, were action-packed movies, but also took time to have some levity and human emotion with scenes like the Terminator learning to smile in T2, or Kyle revealing to Sarah that he came back not because he was ordered, but because of love. Scenes like this make the action more exciting as the story feels real and it connects with the audience on an emotional level as well so when the big car chases DO come in, the audience is genuinely invested as opposed to just 'Explosions! Awesome!'If there's anything redeeming about the film, it'd be the technicals. The cinematography has a very gritty, greyish look to it that helps sell the despair that the characters are feeling and the special effects are surprisingly convincing. They made good use of both CGI and animatronics for all the different Terminators and the way they blend together is very smooth and seamless. The action feels appropriately gritty and brutal while not showing a whole lot of blood. And props to McG for not using shaky-cam like so many rubbish action directors working today.Overall, Terminator Salvation just seems confused. The writers seem to have no idea how to continue the story so they just end up creating a filler story. It's a good film on a technical level but it lacks heart. If you just want an action movie, you'll get it. But if want you something more, then keep on looking. 4/10",4,1,4,24 March 2014
Zodiac," A Fascinating, Disturbing Look into the Men Who Lost Their Lives Looking for the Zodiac
","NOTE: this a review of the director's cut, not the theatrical cutZodiac is an interesting film. It's about the infamous real-life, San Francisco serial killer, the Zodiac. The film goes through his murders and investigations in detail from 1969 to 1991. But instead of diverting from fact and making the story more 'cinematic', they keep it very faithful to what happened in real-life, making this a very plot-driven movie. But does it work? Let's find out!First of all, I'm gonna talk about the storytelling in the film. The film has a LOT of plot as it covers an entire murder investigation from 1969 to 1991 and it goes through very quickly. It starts off quickly with the murder of two teenagers in a car and from then on, it never slows down and it actually works quite well like this. Often, movies are long because of bad, unnecessarily slow pacing but here, it's appropriate because this IS a very long story. However, it does make the film somewhat hard to sit through because of how long it is. By the last 40 minutes or so, you'll be checking your watch and yawning a bit so this film certainly isn't a light, breezy watch.The film also has a dark, chilling atmosphere to it and the cinematography, like all of David Fincher's productions, is very dark and stylized. This was actually pretty surprising for me since this is a true story, I expected them to use as realistic cinematography as possible but instead, they went for a slicker, more stylish direction which is actually quite a positive because to me, realistic cinematography is boring.The film is also very disturbing as it features realistic, brutal murders that isn't the least bit glamorized. The murders here are raw and brutal, not the fun, over-the-top violence you see in a Friday the 13th flick. But not only is the violence disturbing, but also the story. It features these obsessed, workaholic men who do very little beyond trying to find the Zodiac. When you think about it, this film isn't really about the Zodiac. It's about the men looking for the Zodiac. It's about how these men lost their lives looking for something they never found. It's a sad story about how sometimes your job, or interest can become an obsession that will ruin your life. Towards the end of the film, our protagonist, Robert, becomes so obsessed with finding the Zodiac to the point where he starts abandoning his family and getting creepy phone calls from an anonymous caller. It's a very thought- provoking statement about jobs and interests and it's beautifully expressed by Fincher's direction.The cast here is perfect. Jake Gyllenhaal is the everyman in this story. He's a cartoonist who finds the Zodiac letters in his workplace and gradually becomes more and more obsessed with him and we believe it. Mark Ruffalo is a detective who's been assigned to find the Zodiac. He plays it very soft-spoken and polite but throughout the story, we see him get more and more frustrated with the way things are going on and Ruffalo sells all these emotions really well. Robert Downey Jr. is playing... well, Robert Downey, Jr. But you know what, he's GREAT at playing Robert Downey Jr. so no complaints here. Everyone else was great too but these were definitely the 'big boys'.Overall, it's a fascinating, disturbing look into the lives of men who lost their lives looking for a serial killer. 8/10.",8,0,0,25 October 2013
Alien," A True Horror Classic
","Alien is a film that survives on the strength of its atmosphere, chills, and unpredictability. Without those things, the film might not be remembered for anything other than for being the starting ground for Sigourney Weaver. But since we have a haunting atmosphere, effective scares, and an unpredictable screenplay, we get one of the most iconic horror films ever made. But what makes these things in Alien work? Let's find out!The plot of Alien follows a commercial towing spaceship by the name of Nostromo being sent to investigate a shipwreck on a mysterious, foreign planet where they encounter a strange alien being that attaches itself to one of the crew members faces with no way to get rid of it. It eventually detaches itself from his face, only then to have a creature violently burst out of his chest, killing him in the process. It then grows into a bigger alien who silently picks off the crew members one by one.The main strengths of Alien are the atmosphere, chills, and unpredictability. This film features an incredibly haunting, eerie atmosphere that just intrigues you from beginning to end. The visuals hook you in from the moment the movie starts with these slow pans of different areas of the ship and the slow reveal of the movie's title. With the complete lack of sound and slow cuts, it gives you a sense of isolation and dread right away. Then, they approach the mysterious planet and we get some truly unique-looking visuals that look just as strange and alien to us as it does for the main characters. The camera-work is very creepy with the way it lingers on certain things without any reasoning in the film to do so, leaving us very lost just like the crew members themselves. The film DOES simmer down the eerieness a bit when they go back to the ship but once the alien pops out of Kane's chest, it goes back to being unsettling again knowing that it could pop out anywhere in this dark, claustrophobic environment. I could go on and on about how effective the atmosphere in the film is but to sum it up, it's one of the key factors to the film's success.This is also a pretty terrifying film. While it takes its time to build up its scares, when it strikes, it always works. They build those moments up for SO long, when it happens, you often don't expect it so it scares the sh!t out of you. The alien itself is terrifying in its design and conception. It has a very black, gooey look in close-ups with an extra set of teeth inside its mouth which is pretty freaky, but in long shots, it has an oddly phallic, almost fetishistic look to it. In fact, the way the alien is written has a kinda rapish feel to it the entire time. Think about it, he grabs you when you least expect it, causes you to pass out, and then impregnates you while you're unconscious. I know this sounds really strange and some of you are probably gonna call me a sick pervert for thinking something like this but I think this was the filmmaker's intention, because it adds a disturbing edge on a psychological level and it makes the film scarier than had it just relied on loud noises to scare you like a lot of horror films today.But my favorite thing about the film has to be its unpredictability. Even though this is pretty straight-forward plot, the way it develops is very unpredictable and intriguing. For example, when the alien first bursts out and grabs onto Kane's face, it feels so unexpected because has been very quiet and slow up to this point, so it completely surprises you and makes you interested to see the rest of the film. When Kane's taken back to the ship, everything the alien does is surprising. When one of them tries to use a saw to cut it off his face, it bleeds acid. Just when it gets off Kane's face and he seems just fine, all of a sudden, an alien POPS right out of his chest! And if that's not enough, there's a plot twist that the ship's science officer, Ash, is an android! It turns out that he's been sent to bring the alien back to the crew's employers to use as a weapon. That itself is fascinating and it makes the film's universe feel a whole lot bigger. It's these things that keep the film consistently interesting.Lastly, I want to point out the film's performances, effects, sound design. While the characters in the film have been criticized by some critics for not having much personality, I thought they were all well- defined and they all felt like real people to me. They're not technobabble-speaking geniuses from Star Trek, they're just like normal folks delivering a package by boat. The standout performance is Sigourney Weaver as Ripley. While she doesn't develop into an action hero yet(that happens in the sequel), Weaver has a believable authoritative presence on screen. When she's taking charge of what to do about the alien, you buy it. But she can also sell being scared and paranoid in a claustrophobic environment with a deadly alien around convincingly. It's a very tough balance to strike but Weaver pulls it off well. The film also won an Oscar for special effects and it definitely deserves it. The miniature and model work for the Nostromo looks incredibly convincing and all the alien effects have an organic look that can't be replicated in CGI. The sound design is very eerie with a discomforting silence for the majority of the film but also some really strange, unusual sounds for the alien that sound incredibly disturbing.Overall, Alien is a classic with a haunting atmosphere, effective scares, an unpredictable screenplay, a strong lead performance, and some excellent technicals. 9/10",8,1,3,15 June 2014

The man sounds authoritative when he's speaking to the military and has a kindness and gentleness when he's speaking to Lois. Some of the designs were pretty neat. I was surprised in a good way how the designers chose to not copy the Fortress of Solitude from the Richard Donner Superman and I like how high-tech Krypton feels in this version. The cast for me was hit-and-miss, I liked Russell Crowe as Jor-El, Amy Adams as Lois Lane, and Laurence Fishburne as Perry White. And lastly, I like that Superman actually fights in this film as opposed to Superman Returns where he was taken down by Kryptonite and has to lift up a Kryptonite mountain to win.Cons: The pacing feels really rushed once we get down to Earth. They kept on flashing back to his teenage years in Smallville and it was just unnecessary. They should've told it in a linear fashion like in the Donner Superman. The tone is just depressing throughout. The score by Hans Zimmer is so down the entire time! There's barely any humour in this film at all! These things just make the film depressing and I miss the positive spirit that the Donner Superman had. The action is just excessive and mindless. Superman doesn't care about the property at all in this film, he slams Zod into buildings non-stop possibly killing hundreds of citizens! I also found Kevin Costner to be bland in the role of Jonathan Kent especially compared to the excellent one we had in Smallville.Overall: This film was just depressing, rushed and mindless. It tries way to hard to be like Batman Begins and it just doesn't work because of that. Superman should not be this dark and girt! The pacing was rushed, the action is excessive and mindless, and the character development seemed to be forgotten midway through the film.Final Verdict: 4/10",4,10,20,30 June 2013
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Entertaining but Soulless
","When it comes to sequels, third's not always the charm. In fact, it rarely is. For some reason, Hollywood can SOMETIMES get #2 in a series right but rarely #3. And Terminator 3 is, considered by a lot of people, not to be an exception to that rule. Fans seem to generally hate this one, calling it the first nail in the coffin for the franchise with Terminator Salvation being the next. But is it really as bad as people have claimed? Let's take a look and find out!The plot takes place seven years after the second film where Sarah Connor has died of leukemia and John now lives off the grid, like a homeless bum. Even though they destroyed Cyberdyne Systems and supposedly stopped Judgment Day, John still feels unsafe and paranoid that it'll eventually come and he'll have to fight for the fate of mankind. It turns out that Judgment Day was never stopped, only postponed as two Terminators come back in time, one to assassinate John, and one to protect him.I remember reading somewhere that Linda Hamilton was offered to reprise her role as Sarah Connor in this film but declined and called the script 'soulless' and that pretty much sums up the entire film for me. While it's not as bad as a lot of sequels out there, or even that bad of a film in general, it just feels soulless and empty. Terminator 2 was really the finale of the franchise. They destroyed Cyberdyne and basically prevented Judgment Day from ever happening so there really was no need for a sequel at all.Speaking of T2, this film is also severely lacking in creativity. It basically rehashes all the same plot points of T2 except without Sarah Connor, and contradicting the message in that film(more on this later). Now, you could argue that since T2 borrowed a lot from the first Terminator as well, it's not that big of a problem but the thing is, T2 developed the characters further, it expanded the universe, and it explored the themes of the first film deeper. This film doesn't do any of that, it just uses all the same concepts and ideas except now, the message of the second film about how humanity isn't doomed by fate and how we can change it, is now replaced with 'it's destiny'. It could have been an interesting concept to explore, about how humanity is destined to destroy itself someday, but it just feels like an excuse to continue the franchise and make more money in this case.Okay, so I just basically tore up the film in the two last paragraphs but why don't I hate this film? Well, plain and simply, it's entertaining. While it's certainly not as thought-provoking as James Cameron's films, it still works as an action movie. The fights between the Terminators are brutal, fast-paced, and intense. There's a scene where they fight in a bathroom and they smash literally EVERYTHING in that room. It's so over-the-top, it actually becomes sort of funny at points. The pacing was fairly quick, never leaving the audience bored much and there's some decent suspense throughout(nothing compared to the first two, though). The film also LOOKS quite good. The cinematographer, Don Burgess, did a good job recreating a similar look to T2 and while the CGI isn't quite photo-realistic, it was used REASONABLY and there was a good use of both practical stunts and animatronics as well so I won't fault it too much for that.The cast is just sorta hit-and-miss here. Arnold is more emotionless this time around, no longer the caring father figure to John and it works since John is no longer a kid. Nick Stahl oddly plays John whinier as an adult than Edward Furlong did as a child but nonetheless, Stahl does a good job playing a man trying to escape his own destiny. Claire Danes does OKAY as Kate Brewster, but her character was just sort of bland and uninteresting throughout to the point where her performance was ultimately forgettable. Kristanna Loken is again, sorta bland and forgettable, which is a shame considering that she's the main villain of the film. She just lacks any sort of menace and isn't in anyway intimidating throughout the entire film and it really feels like she only got cast for the sake of sex appeal.Director Jonathan Mostow seems capable but he lacks the attention to detail James Cameron has and he doesn't seem to put the same level of nuance in his film. He just seems more interested in getting us to the next action scene and less interested in the human elements that made the first two films so fantastic. But the thing he seems to struggle with the most is humor. This film just goes way too far at times to the point where it feels like downright parody. Do I even HAVE to mention the part where Arnold gets his clothes from a male strip club? Thankfully, the humor gradually died down and became more subtle as the film went on.Overall, if you just want a fun, brainless popcorn flick that just happens to be a Terminator film, you'll enjoy it. But if you really want something meatier and more intelligent, than you should probably look somewhere else. This is just another Hollywood cash-grab sequel. Nothing more, nothing less. I'm gonna give it a 5/10.",5,1,2,15 March 2014
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," The First Harry Potter Movie that isn't Just an Adaptation
","Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the first Harry Potter movie that isn't just an adaptation, it's also a good movie on its own. Not that the first two were bad, but they felt more like adaptations than they do films. Why is this one better? Let's take a look, shall we?First of all, the technicals are far superior in this film than they were on both The Philosopher's Stone and The Chamber of Secrets. The cinematography has a lot more style going on here than they did in the first two. Alfonso Cuaron is a very Gothic director and it shows here because there's so much more grey and darkness in the cinematography this time around and it looks beautiful. The special effects are also upgraded, while the first film had some great effects for the time, it's definitely aged. The second film had a much smoother look with its CGI but there's nothing terribly impressive about them. This film however, still looks excellent nine years later. All the creatures in this film have a lot more detail in their movements and design and Buckbeak(a hippogriff in this film) is probably the best example. During his introduction scene, he's always doing some sort of movement in the background. If you look carefully, you can actually see him taking a dump, I'm not kidding. There's also a lot more detail in each shot. Every time I watch this movie, I always see something in the background that I didn't notice before such as a certain prop or someone in the background doing something. Lastly, the score is even more beautiful and elegant in this film than the first two.Secondly, the story is a lot more engaging this time around. The first film had a fun, imaginative story but what it lacked was compelling human drama. Though, it definitely had its emotional moments. The second film had a little more human drama going on but there isn't any real character arcs for our three protagonists. This film in comparison, actually has adult themes and compelling character arcs. This movie is ultimately about confronting your past. Harry's character arc in this movie is about learning to get over his past. Throughout the film, he's haunted by his past. He has memories of his mother's scream as she's about to be killed by Voldemort, he wants to murder Sirius Black when he learns that he was the reason the Potters are dead, and he constantly gets attacked by Dementors whom sucks away his best memories and inflicts some of his darkest memories. But throughout the film, he gets over his past because he learns to remember who they were and what they stood for. The scene that illustrate his arc the most is when Sirius and Remus want to murder Peter Pettigrew, the real man who's responsible for the death of the Potters, but Harry tells them not to because his parents wouldn't have wanted them to become murderers. That scene shows that he remembers his parents for who they were and will do what they would've done.So there's some good character stuff in here but one thing I don't like is that there's this really cheesy speech given by Sirius Black at the end of the film that goes like ' Even though they're dead, they're still in your heart. ' Come on, was that speech necessary? Another thing I don't like is that Harry at the beginning of the film kinda looks like a murderer. He accidentally blows up Aunt Marge when she insulted his parents but he doesn't even think about trying to save her! That's just cruel!Some other things I want to touch upon is the shooting, acting, and writing. Cuaron has a very unconventional way of shooting. The dialogue scenes in this movie often are shot in one-take without any edits and that's pretty unusual for a movie today but I actually really like it! The acting from the adults are good as always, Emma Thompson is really funny here as Professor Trelawney but I think the showstealer is David Thewlis as Professor Lupin. He has a warmth and wisdom to his performance that makes it believable why Harry latches onto him so much. The kids definitely show some improvement here compared to the first film where they were just kinda reading lines. Daniel Radcliffe kinda overacts here and there but he overall carries the film well. Rupert Grint doesn't do a whole lot but he interacts well with Emma Watson and there's some really funny moments with them together. And Emma seems a lot more natural this time around. This film is a lot less faithful to the book compared to the first two films but I actually think that's a good thing. The first two had somewhat stilted dialogue and awkward pacing here and there but this film fixes these problems because there's more attention to making a good movie rather than just being faithful to the book.Overall, this film is a huge improvement over the first two. Better acting, writing, and technicals make this film triumph over the first two. I am gonna give it a 8/10.",10,0,1,2 August 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man," The Amazingly Soulless Spider-Man
","I guess it was inevitable that the Spider-Man franchise would get rebooted. I mean, Spider-Man 3 generated a huge backlash with things like 'emo Peter', not much Venom, too many characters etc. Things weren't any better behind-the-scenes as Sam Raimi left due to differences with the studio and thus, causing the cast to leave as well. So as a backup, Sony decided to completely REBOOT the franchise with a new director, new cast, and an all-around new vision to keep the rights to the character. So, is The Amazing Spider-Man really... amazing? Let's find out!The plot of The Amazing Spider-Man is basically a re-telling of the origin but in this version, Peter Parker is a socially-awkward teenager with a past hidden from him as his parents mysteriously left him one night in the belonging of Uncle Ben and Aunt May with no explanation whatsoever. He goes to Oscorp one day to try to find some stuff regarding his parents after finding a briefcase in his house with info on them leading him there, where he ultimately gets bit by a genetically-enhanced spider that ends up giving him superpowers. At first, he uses it irresponsibly, but after Uncle Ben dies because of Peter letting a thief escape, he decides to use his powers for good and fight crime known as Spider-Man.While The Amazing Spider-Man isn't a terrible film, it is, however, a soulless film. The movie feels like a business decision on Sony's part and not a story a writer and director wanted to tell. But first, let's get the good stuff out of the way, shall we?The cast is mostly solid. Garfield is very convincing as the socially-awkward Peter Parker, his constant stuttering and twitching make you believe that a guy like him would get picked on in high-school. But as Spider-Man, he came across as a really obnoxious, unfunny douche. I know this is faithful to how he acts like in the comics but this constant cracking of lame jokes and puns just don't work on FILM. Emma Stone is typically likable here as Gwen Stacy and her chemistry with Garfield is excellent. You really believe these two in a relationship together. Martin Sheen does a great job as Uncle Ben, with a believable concern and care for Peter. But Sally Field just doesn't work as Aunt May, she comes across as an annoying nag rather than a moral guidance for Peter. But everyone else was good in the cast.The film also LOOKS quite good. Spider-Man looks better than he ever has on film. The way he swings through New York and does all his acrobatic movements are very well-done. The scene that showcased this the best was probably the scene where Spidey swings through multiple cranes set up for him to get to Oscorp, that was a fun scene. While the action doesn't exactly rival The Dark Knight Rises or The Avengers, they WERE good and a lot of it felt like watching a comic-book on screen. Especially the fight with the Lizard in the school hallway.But while the film has those things, it ultimately feels soulless. What I mean by this, is that, the story just doesn't need to be told again. This film basically follows the same structure and many of the same plot points of the 2002 film and that's NOT the way to do a reboot. The point of a reboot is to tell a story that hasn't been told before under a new timeline. When you just re-hash what was done before except make a few tweaks so it could be labeled a reboot and not a remake, it just comes across as a business decision, and not a story with any flesh and bone. And since we all know this story point by point by now, the impact of seeing things like Spidey swinging on web or using his spider-sense for the first time just doesn't have much of an impact now.The one element they incorporated from the comics that was absent from the Raimi films, was the whole mystery behind what happened to Peter's parents. While this sounded good on paper, the film never goes anywhere with it after setting it up and now that the sequel has come out and we learn that the whole mystery basically amounts to 'Oscorp = bad', it makes this even more disappointing.While Stone and Garfield really do have good chemistry on screen, the way their romance is written and developed, leaves a little to be desired. For one thing, it's REALLY cliché. The script ticks all the boxes of a generic high-school romance. First, they have an awkward conversation in the school hallway, then they have an awkward date, then they kiss. It's also rushed. They look as though they're ready to have spider-sex right after their first date.Even WORSE, is the villain. I know this sound really controversial but I thought the Lizard was one of the worst villains in a comic-book movie. Yes, he was that bad. Why? Well, for one thing, he doesn't fit in the film's tone. This film takes a somewhat more SERIOUS approach with the Spider-Man origin and it shows with the color palette(which was unnecessarily dreary) so a villain like this just feels out of place. Another problem is that they try too hard to make him a 'complex' and 'sympathetic' villain. They try to parallel him missing an arm to Peter missing his parents which doesn't work, because the circumstances are just far too different. And to top it all off, his motivations are really rushed. His switch from noble scientist to savage beast is done in like, a minute. So yeah, he sucks. Overall, while The Amazing Spider-Man is certainly flawed, it could've been forgiven if the film just wasn't so SOULLESS. And that's really why the film didn't work, it was JUST a business decision. 5/10",5,1,3,17 May 2014
Dallas Buyers Club," A Gripping, Powerful Film With an Amazing Lead Performance from McConaughey
","Dallas Buyers Club is one of those movies that could've easily turned into a schmaltz-fest had it fallen into the hands of a lesser director but thanks to a restrained, low-key style of direction from Jean-Marc Vallee, we get a powerful, gripping drama about the redemption of a man with AIDS. But why does it work? Let's find out!Dallas Buyers Club tells the true story of Ron Woodwoof, an electrician and rodeo cowboy living a wild, crazy life in 1980's Dallas loaded with drugs, sex, gambling, and rodeo riding. Woodroof is a true Southern man, he is racist and homophobic and is not afraid to show it. It all changes one day, when he is diagnosed HIV+ and has only 30 days left to live. At first, he is in denial about it, but after doing a little research, he starts to believe that he really does have AIDS and tries to seek help at the hospital, only to have Dr. Eve tell him that there's no FDA approved drugs for HIV at the moment. So he bribes a hospital nurse for a drug called AZT to treat his condition but the drug ends up deteriorating his health instead. So he goes to a Mexican hospital where he is treated with two non-approved drugs, ddC and protein peptide T and they actually end up working for him. So he imports these drugs into the U.S. to sell them for other HIV patients.Even though this has been stated a thousand other times in other reviews, I feel like I still have to say it, Matthew McConaughey is amazing in this film. His arc in the film going from a xenophobic, carefree rodeo cowboy to a caring, compassionate man who wants to help people of all races and sexuality is both touching and believable. He starts out actually quite unlikable in the film with his coke snorting, prostitute banging, money gambling lifestyle where he doesn't seem to give a sh!t about anything in life and has this bigoted worldview around him but throughout the film, we see him slowly change into a different person in a believable way. He develops a friendship with a transsexual named Rayon, he starts giving his drugs out for free(taking in membership fees instead), and starts doing it with CARE for people rather than just out of money. His standout scene is when he breaks down in his car, contemplating killing himself, it's a really powerful scene and towards the end of the film, you really do become attached to this character because of McConaughey's amazing performance.But McConaughey's performance isn't the ONLY thing that's driving the film, it also has a lot to do with the direction. As stated before, this film easily could've been a schmaltz-fest, but Vallee goes for a very low-key, realistic style of direction that makes the drama have more impact than had if he gone all out with schmaltz. Vallee's direction is very minimalistic, he doesn't tell you how to feel for each scene, he just lets you experience it. There's no sappy score playing in the background, no super dramatic character moments, no emotional speeches, and no scenes that really try to tug at your heartstrings, the emotions in the film are very restrained. When a certain character dies in the film, he just dies. We never see him make any final words to Woodroof or have any character cry dramatically over his body. We DO see how people are affected by this but it's done in a realistic fashion where the tears are rough and angry. This may make the film sound COLD, but it actually makes the film ultimately more touching because it makes you feel like you're really taking a peak into someone's life and not watching a fabricated movie version of it, even though the film is highly fictionalized.Another strength of the film is the script. A lot of movies featuring characters fighting against a system often portray the authority as very one-dimensional and cartoonishly rotten. Here, the writers were smart enough to treat the story with respect by portraying the authority realistically. They're not mustache-twirling villains, they're simply people who disagree with Woodroof's way of thinking and thinks that only drugs approved by the FDA should be allowed for public use. While we tend to side with Woodroof, the FDA never does anything that makes them really evil and make you hate them. I'm glad the writers didn't divulge into cliché Hollywood stereotypes of authority.I've already praised McConaughey's performance but the rest of the cast is equally excellent. Jared Leto completely loses himself in the role of Rayon, leaving no trace of the actor behind. Not only does the makeup look convincing on him, he also walks, talks, and ACTS like a real transgender! If someone just came across a sneak peek of this film on their TV, they'd probably think Jared Leto really was a transgender in this film. I've heard a few people complain about Jennifer Garner's performance in this and while I'm generally not a fan of her, she actually does a good job in the film as Dr. Eve. Her conflicts with the system is actually believable and her romance with Woodroof is surprisingly effective. They have good chemistry on screen and their relationship together doesn't deride on silly Hollywood romance clichés.Overall, Dallas Buyers Club is a gripping, powerful film with an incredible lead performance, restrained yet effective direction, a smart script, and a great supporting cast. 8/10",7,1,1,23 June 2014
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Weak Script But Fun Action
","The Lost World: Jurassic Park is another unnecessary, cash-grab sequel to a highly successful film. Even though many of the cast and crew return, such as Spielberg, screenwriter David Koepp, Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenborough, John Williams, and editor Michael Kahn, it really is an inferior film. I think Spielberg and Koepp came into it with the right intentions but somehow, nothing just seems as magical as it was the first time. But does that make The Lost World bad? Let's find out!The film follows Dr. Ian Malcolm after the events of the first film where he has now publicized the incident at Jurassic Park with a strong lack of belief from the public. John Hammond then contacts Ian to travel to Jurassic Park site B, Isla Sorna, where the dinosaurs were first engineered but have now run amok due to a hurricane destroying the containment facilities, to document the dinosaurs with a team in their natural habitat to get public support against the site from being exploited by InGen. Ian initially refuses, but decides to go after hearing his wife, Sarah, is already there. Meanwhile, they come across InGen mercenaries capturing dinosaurs there for another park being built in San Diego.The most noticeable problems with The Lost World are the characterizations and the 'been there, done that' feel. The film's characters, are either blandly uninteresting, or annoying and stupid. While the first film didn't have exceptionally well-written characters, they were all well-defined and likable. Here, the characters are all just so weak and forgettable. While Goldblum is generally likable in the film, whenever he has a dramatic moment, he seems tired and uninterested. Julianne Moore is OKAY as Sarah, but she doesn't make much of an impression and her character is pretty fwcking stupid in places when she fearlessly gets up close to the dinosaurs to observe them and hangs blood stained shirts in a tent that end up attracting the dinosaurs. Vanessa Lee Chester is simply awful as Kelly, Ian's daughter. She embodies the annoying, irritating kid character everybody hates such as Jake Lloyd's Anakin Skywalker and the way she's written isn't much better. They have this little sub-plot about her and Ian not spending enough time and how he's never much of a dad to her and Ian goes through an arc in the film learning to be a better father. I really don't like this sub-plot because it's so cliché and overdone these days and it feels like such artificial drama. It really comes across as a cheap way to add an emotional core to the film. I cringed every time she's on screen. The rest of the actors, such as Vince Vaughn, Peter Postlewaite, Richard Schiff, and Arliss Howard are OKAY in their roles, but again, don't make any sort of impression whatsoever. The only real character I liked, was John Hammond once again played by Richard Attenborough. Even though it's only a bit part, Attenborough is extremely compelling to watch and is easily the best actor out of the whole film.The film also doesn't feel fresh. While the plot isn't an exact copy of the first film, a lot of the scenes come off as a lame attempt to give you that 'wow' factor from watching the original but since we've already seen this before, it just doesn't have the same impact. For example, remember the iconic 'Welcome to Jurassic Park scene.' from the first film? Well, here, they try to do a similar thing with Ian and Sarah looking in awe of these Stegosaurus's but it just doesn't wow like it did the first time. Especially since the Stegosaurus's are some of the weaker effects in the film. They also do a similar scene where a T-Rex puts his head through a tent with the people inside it trying not to make a sound to avoid his awareness JUST like the scene with the kids in the car with the T-Rex outside from the original. These scenes just feel like lame attempts to emulate the first film and lacks impact as result.But if I were to say I didn't enjoy this film, I'd be lying. While it's certainly not a great film in terms of characterization and a lot of the scenes DO feel like cheap knock-offs of the original, this is an undeniably entertaining movie. The dinosaurs are just as cool as they were in the first film with slightly improved special effects. The action scenes, while a little implausible in places, are nonetheless, very well staged and often have good suspense to them. My favorite scene's probably the T-Rex's rampage through San Diego, that was awesome.Overall, if you can get past the weak characterizations and the 'been there, done that' feeling, you'll enjoy this film for its outstanding action sequences. 6/10",6,1,3,18 June 2014
Kick-Ass," Violent, Twisted, Foul... I Like It!
","Kick-Ass is one of the most refreshing superhero films I've seen in a long time. It's violent, twisted, foul, offensive, disgusting, and I love it! But how can you like a movie that encourages 11-year-olds to swear like AVGN, you ask. I'm gonna take a look into it and find out.The first thing people need to understand about Kick-Ass is that this movie is pure escapist fantasy. Yes, the movie is about a guy who tries to become a superhero in the ' real world ' but let's face it, this movie isn't very realistic and it was never meant to be. It's just meant to be an escapist fantasy so the fact that it has so little morals in this movie actually isn't a problem. This isn't No Country for Old Men or The Godfather where you can discuss the morality behind the characters decisions and decide on your own who's right and who's wrong. This is closer to movies like The Warriors or the James Bond series where you know what you're watching isn't politically correct but you still enjoy it because of how much fun it is.Kick-Ass is also really funny, clever, and unique. The comedy in this film is very foul and crude but to me, it's actually pretty funny! This movie kinda has its own hyper-reality where people cuss all day and crime is more prominent and people are a lot more raunchy. So not everybody will find this movie funny but I do and I think it's a great satire on modern superhero movies.While this movie isn't terribly deep and complex, it does have one important theme it analyzes. What makes a hero a hero? Dave Lizewski is not the ideal hero. He isn't a strong, athletic guy who can kick the crap out of bad guys, he's just a guy who has a dream and goes for it. But ultimately, he becomes a hero because of his good heart and not because he can kick @ss. Same with Hit-Girl, who is just an 11-year-old girl but she becomes a hero at the end of the film when she takes down Frank D'amico's men nearly all by herself. While this movie is really foul and crude, it has a very optimistic message to it that everybody can be a hero.So there is a little bit of character stuff in this movie but its main focus is just to entertain and I think the director, Matthew Vaughn did an amazing job with this film. He brought the world of Kick-Ass to life perfectly and I especially love his choice of music here. It sounds very Quentin Tarantino influenced, it's great!The performances here are top notch. Aaron Johnson is really likable and funny here as Kick-Ass and he carries the film well. Mark Strong is a little over-the-top here but it's appropriate because Kick-Ass takes place in a hyper-reality. But the people who steal the show are Nicolas Cage and Chloe Moretz. They have a great father-daughter relationship going on but also as hero and sidekick.Overall, Kick-Ass is a really funny, clever, unique, and refreshing superhero film so I'm gonna give it a 8/10.",8,5,7,11 August 2013
The Evil Dead," Amateur Filmmaking at its Finest
","The Evil Dead is amateur filmmaking at its finest. It was directed by an amateur filmmaker at the time, Sam Raimi and had a budget of only $375,000. So we have a director who has basically no training whatsoever and only made amateur short films prior to this, a budget of only $375,000, and a cast of actors who were just friends of Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell and had no acting experience prior hand. This should have been a recipe for disaster but instead we got a fun, original, atmospheric, well-shot, and spooky horror film that proves once again that small budgets can still make great films. But why is that? Let's take a look and find out!Firstly, the story. This film tells a very simple story about a group of college friends who decide to stay in a cabin together for a few days but end up encountering all sorts of demons when they open up the Book of the Dead. It all sounds very basic and simple but it works because unlike most movies, the story isn't really the meat of this movie. Most movies would have the story continually develop the characters but here, the story is just used as a setup for all the scenarios this movie throws at us. So in a nutshell, the story isn't especially deep and complex but it's not a problem because this movie really isn't about the characters, it's about the horror and that's what this movie delivers.This movie's horror is very effective because of the way it's shot. Sam Raimi uses a lot of POV shots for the demons in this movie and it makes the forest seem really creepy because you can tell there's something out there but you don't see it, your imagination fills in the blanks for you and it makes it way scarier than if they just had some sort of optical printer effect or an animatronic because you picture whatever scares you to be in the forest. So the fact that this movie had a baby-size budget actually made it better because it allowed Raimi to think of more creative ways to create chills rather than just throwing in some cheap special effect. Kinda like Spielberg did with Jaws.While the film is a horror film, it still has a campy feel to it which makes it more fun than if they played it completely straight. The demons are very over-the-top here with all their manic laughs and depraved faces but it makes you feel like a kid again watching this movie and that's always a good thing.The sound design is also quite good in this movie. It creates an eerie mood with the strong wind blowing outside and the quietness in the cabin, it's really spooky! This makes for a good movie to watch late at night, all alone in your room in the dark, with no sound other than the movie. That's probably the best way to watch it.The special effects here are actually pretty well done for such a small budget. They look cheesy but that's what makes it fun. It's okay to be a little cheesy sometimes and this is one of those times.So this film is actually quite good in terms of its direction, camera- work and other technicals but it is flawed in some areas. The makeup on Betsy Baker looks a little cheap compared to the other makeup effects in this movie. Bruce Campbell's acting is a little hokey at times but it's expected for a first-time actor like him and it doesn't ruin the film. And the girls here aren't well defined enough for me to differentiate them. Towards the end of the movie, I had no idea which demon was which girl but it really doesn't matter because once again, this film isn't really about the characters, it's about the scares.This film is also not for everyone. Not everybody will enjoy its campy tone, over-the-top style, and excessive gore but if you are in the mood for a good spook show then this movie is for you.

Ip Man," Solid Action, Solid Drama
","Ip Man is one of the most refreshing martial arts films in a long time. It doesn't succumb to the usual clichés the genre is known for. But what makes it better than most martial arts movies these days? Let's find out!The first thing I want to talk about is the title character himself, Ip Man played by Donnie Yen. I was surprised how devoid of clichés his character was and how well-written he was. He isn't some sort of fearsome warrior but a man who has a skill but no purpose to it. He's extremely gifted in Wing Chun but he doesn't teach it or use it for anything, he just continuously practices it for no reason. But later on, when his friend's factory gets attacked by a gang, he decides to teach the entire factory Wing Chun and ends up saving them from another attack. This is his moment of growth, he finds an actual purpose to live and that's really the message of this movie. It's about using whatever skills you have to make the world a better place and not just sit back and do nothing. It's a great message because they never just flat out say it like a lot of films do.The second thing I want to talk about is the excellent fight choreography. Sammo Hung has often been declared as the greatest action choreography of all-time and while I'm not completely sure of that, he definitely does an excellent job with this film. The first fight in this film is rather light, quick, and short but it works because this scene is simply meant to establish Ip Man's martial arts skills. I am glad that he chose to keep it nice and short for the first fight so we are still hungry for more. The second fight with Ip Man is a lot more intense with the music pounding and stuff breaking, it's great. The third fight with Ip Man is probably the most brutal out of all them all with the way Ip Man repeatedly pounding on their faces and twisting their limbs but it's appropriate because Ip Man is heavily enraged so it isn't just violence for the sake of violence. The fourth fight with Ip Man is somewhere in between the first fight and the third fight. He doesn't go all out like he did in the fourth fight but he doesn't go easy like in the first fight either, he just uses quick, simple self- defense techniques, nothing fancy. The fifth and final fight is probably the most difficult fight for Ip Man in this movie. He actually starts out with a little bit of a problem but ultimately defeats in a brutal manner. All in all, the fight scenes in this movie were great!Some other things I want to touch upon is the acting, shooting, and sound design. While Donnie Yen isn't exactly reinventing himself as an actor, he carries the film well and makes the audience care for him because of his charm and charisma. Everyone else is great too but the one performance that stands out is Gordan Lam. He plays a cowardly guy who has a good heart but isn't brave enough to stand up for himself. He could have just been a stereotypical douchebag if he was played by the wrong actor, but Lam adds a level of nuance that's needed in this film. The cinematography looks great, it draws a sharp contrast between the happier, more peaceful days of Foshan and the darker, more violent time in Foshan. Lastly, the sound design adds a lot of intensity to this film. It has a loud booming sound when there's a fight scene and a level of peace and quietness in the talking scenes. It kinda reminds me of the Christopher Nolan Batman movies.Overall, this is a great film and I highly recommend it to both martial arts fans and historical drama fans. I'm gonna give it a 8/10.",7,2,2,7 August 2013
Rocky," One of My Favorite Sports Dramas
","Sports dramas, what can you say about them? Well, I'm not the biggest of them. For me, the majority of sports dramas are boring, overly- schmultzy, and extremely cliché. I won't say that sports dramas is a sub-genre that I really DESPISE as there are films that I DO like in there but for me, if Hollywood just unexpectedly stopped producing sports dramas in general, it wouldn't be that big of a loss for me. However, there is ONE film in the genre that I happen to really love, and that's Rocky.If you are one of the five people who haven't seen this film, here's a basic rundown of the plot. Rocky Balboa is a small-time boxer and part- time collector for a loan shark living in Philadelphia. His friends include Paulie, a meat-packing plant worker with alcohol problems and violent mood swings, and Adrian, a shy pet shop clerk who's also Paulie's sister. Rocky seems to be going nowhere in life as he's constantly in need for money, winning fights by the skin of his teeth, and nobody seems to see him as anything but a bum. But when World Heavyweight Champion Apollo Creed's opponent Mac Lee Green drops out due to an injured hand, Creed decides to pick an unknown local as his opponent and he chooses Rocky because of his nickname, the Itallion Stallion. Will Rocky go the distance and prove to the world he's not a bum? Or will Creed decimate him in the ring?I think the reason I like Rocky so much is because of hopeful and optimistic it is while still feeling like a real story about real people. A lot of sports dramas feel too sanguine and schmultzy for me to believe that this could happen in real-life but this movie perfectly balances out being optimistic while still having a sense of grit and realism to it that helps us believe in the story. The first half of the film feels very SLOW, and very urban. We get some really LONG takes of Rocky roaming around the streets of Philadelphia that makes the film feel sorta like a documentary in a way and the overall cinematography is very simple and static. This helps ground the film in a realistic style as opposed to it if it was very stylized and creative. They also do a very good job of making you FEEL Rocky's current place in life by having him interact with various people in scenes that don't always have a point in the PLOT, but make you feel just as directionless as Rocky is in his life. When Rocky's preparing for his fight with Apollo, the movie feels a lot more focused in its structure, just like how Rocky now has a purpose in life. The way the film is But what made this film CONNECT with so many people and become a classic was the characters. Rocky is a very real and relatable character because he's not portrayed as an action hero he later would or even a particularly smart guy, he's just an oaf with a good heart. Stallone could've played him really emotional and whiny the whole time but instead, he keeps most of his pain inside which makes for a much more subtle and nuanced performance. Paulie is many ways, what Rocky could have been if he unleashed his frustrations in violent mood swings. He's often angry and moody because of how frustrated he is with his life's shortcomings and he feels his sister owes him because he's the only person she can communicate with and feels unappreciated by her but deep down, has a heart of gold. This character could've just came off as a huge douche but the way Burt Young plays him, makes him likable despite some major flaws in his character. Adrian is kinda like Rocky in a way as he's often unsure of himself and has self-esteem issues but when pushed by someone like Mickey and loved by Adrian, becomes unstoppable. Just like how she's shy and quiet at FIRST, but once given some love, becomes a very strong and in-control woman and Talia Shire plays her part BEAUTIFULLY. She came off very nerdy at first but she changes believably to a very strong woman by the end of the film. Rocky's trainer, Mickey, is very gruff and blunt about his thoughts and feelings a lot of the times but he's also the father figure to Rocky as he's the one who motivates him the most when he needs it outside of Adrian and his gruffness can be interpreted as 'tough love'. All these characters were very likable and compelling in their own right.And then, there's the score by Bill Conti, which has now become a part of any gym trainer's MP3 playlist and for good reason too. The music in the film is very powerful, it starts out being very subdued and sad when Rocky's aimlessly wandering through Philly but then it becomes bombastic and triumphant when Rocky's getting ready for the big fight. It has this sorta brass fanfare sound to it that fits boxing very well and the softer piano pieces perfectly compliments Rocky's downbeat lifestyle.Lastly, I want to touch upon the final fight. Whereas most movies would try to make this scene as exciting as possible. Here, Rocky just ENDURES the entire fight and doesn't do much damage to Apollo until the very end where he manages to bruise his ribs. He doesn't even win the fight in the end, Apollo won due to a split decision. I love that Rocky doesn't win at the end because he doesn't HAVE to, he already proved that he's not a bum and that's what the whole movie's about. The script's very consistent in this sense.Overall, Rocky is well-directed, well-written, has great characters, and has a great score. It definitely deserves its status as a classic. 8/10",8,1,1,28 March 2014
Les Misérables," Spectacular Performances Overcome Too Much Singing, Too Much Plot, and Some Flawed Technicals
","Am I the only guy who's willing to admit that I like musicals? Granted, I'm not a HUGE fan of musicals, but whenever I see a good one, I appreciate it. For me, a good musical shouldn't use a story as the backbone for the songs, but instead, use the songs to enhance the story it's telling. Sadly, a lot of musicals put too much emphasis on the musical aspect, but not enough on the actual story. Hairspray is a good example of this. It's a fun movie, but the story felt like a preachy anti-racism PSA and it tackled the subject a little too simplistically for my tastes. Does Les Miserables fare any better? Let's find out!Les Miserables follows convict Jean Valjean in released on parole in 1815 France by prison guard Javert after serving a nineteen- year sentence for stealing a loaf of bread. Because of his status, he fails to find a job anywhere and is driven out of every town he visits. One night, he is offered food and shelter by a bishop only then, to find the authorities catching Valjean stealing his silver in the middle of the night. However, the bishop lies for him and spears him extra time in prison. Touched by his kindness, Valjean breaks parole and starts a new life under a new identity.Les Miserables is a hard film to critique. It tries its best to stay faithful to the original Broadway musical while adjusting things here and there to make it more cinematic but for the most part, it stays incredibly accurate to the original play. Stage and film are two incredibly different mediums so if I criticize a certain aspect of the film, I'm almost ALWAYS criticizing the original play as well so it's kinda hard to criticize the filmmakers on this film. However, since this is an ADAPTATION, things SHOULD be changed so if there's an aspect in the film that doesn't work, I guess I'll criticize the filmmakers for it since it's THEIR job to change things up to make it work better as a film.What works about Les Miserables, is the story of the journey and redemption of Jean Valjean. Hugh Jackman in this film, gives the performance of a lifetime in the role. His journey is incredibly moving as Jackman displays a strong variety of emotions here. From the despair of being an unemployed, homeless paroled convict, to the determination of wanting to turn his life around, to the care and affection he feels toward Cosette, to the guilt of being a wanted man who can't see Cosette getting married, it's all done with sincerity and believable emotion.The rest of the cast is mostly solid. The performance that's been getting the most fuss about, Anne Hathaway as Fantine, is excellent. She really sells the despair and sadness of a woman forced to pleasure men for a living and the makeup artists did an excellent job of making a woman as sexy as Anne Hathaway appear rusty and unappealing. Eddie Redmayne has the right dashing persona and looks as Maurius. Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen offer some nice comic relief as the Thernardiers. And Amanda Seyfried is EFFECTIVE as Cosette, despite my disinterest in her character. The only real flaw in the cast, is Russell Crowe as Javert. While Crowe LOOKS the part, his singing is just incredibly bland throughout and he only seems to have one tone in his voice. But overall, a solid cast.The sound mixing in the film is also very impressive. A lot of the songs have this big, powerful operatic sound to it and all the different actors'singing voices merge together flawlessly. I highly recommend getting this film on blu-ray if you own a blu-ray player.However, with all that said and done, what DOESN'T work about this film, is the singing. It's not that the singing ITSELF was bad, it's just that there's too much of it. Nearly every single line of dialogue is sung, which works on stage, but on film, it comes off a little distracting and it makes the emotional moments lose a bit of impact because we've been sitting through singing the entire time so songs like I Dreamed a Dream or Javert's Suicide lose a bit of impact. If I had to rewrite the film, I would've kept the important, emotional ones such as Valjean's Soliloquy or Do You Hear the People Sing? but cut out ones like Fantine's Arrest or Suddenly.Another problem is the amount of plot going on in this film. While Valjean's quest for redemption is a compelling one, he feels pushed to the side a bit in the second half with a bajillion characters coming in and coming out of the story. Some of the sub-plots were intriguing such as the revolution and Fantine's turn to prostitution but the love story between Marius and Cosette is really kinda shallow and cliché and uninteresting and it's made even worse with the unnecessary third wheel that is Eponine. I wished the film could've had more focus on Valjean and less on the supporting characters in the second act.There's also some technical flaws with the film. The cinematography is just TERRIBLE in this film. There are FAR too many close-ups and uses of the fisheye lens and the use of shaky-cam is just inappropriate.The production design also looks a little cheap and phony in places. A lot of times, I felt more like I was at a crappy soundstage than I was in 1800's France. There's also some lousy CGI crane shots on occasion that took out of the film.But overall, Les Miserable's strong performances overcome those problems for me so I'll give it a 7/10.",7,0,0,30 May 2014
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," A Fun Ride for the Entire Family
","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is the second installment in the long-running Harry Potter series. It's usually ranked as one of the lower films in the series but does that mean it's a bad film? Well, let's take a look and find out, shall we?The story here is actually an improvement over The Philosopher's Stone. In that film, we spend a lot of time sucking up the magic and wonderment of Hogwarts but we don't get a whole lot of story. Chamber of Secrets on the other hand, is a lot more plot-driven. Almost every scene in this film has a plot point in it and this is a good thing because it makes the film feel a lot more brisk in its pace despite the runtime.The story here is also much more compelling than The Philosopher's Stone. This film builds a lot of mystery with the voice Harry keeps hearing, Harry speaking Parstletongue, Tom Riddle's diary etc. If you haven't read the book, you most likely won't be able to see where this is all going and it keeps the audience engaged to the very end.This film also has a more ominous tone to it. In the first film, there's a few dark moments here and there such as Voldemort drinking unicorn blood or Quirrel getting his face melted off but overall, it's a very safe, family-friendly picture. While this film is still family-friendly, it has a lot more darker implications. We have implications in here of racism, murder, death, and even slavery. These are certainly dark themes to put in a children's movie but Columbus manages to strive a good balance between the darker themes and the whimsical tone. There's still a lot of humor and whimsic to this film and it helps appeal to the kids but it doesn't feel too childish for adults either.The performances in this film are also a step up from the first film. In the first film, Radcliffe was a little wooden at times and so was the rest of the trio. You can definitely tell that they were inexperienced but they still did alright jobs. In this film, the trio seem to be much more comfortable in their roles. Radcliffe is capable of much more complex emotions this time around and he carries the film well. Rupert Grint's acting is a little exaggerated at times but he does so in an entertaining way and he provides good comic relief for the film. Watson seems to be much more relaxed this time. In the first film, she looks like she tried really hard to act smart but in this film, she seems to not need to try as hard which shows that she matured as an actress. And of course, the adult actors are great, particularly Kenneth Branagh as Gilderoy Lockhart who makes you both love to hate him and laugh it him.However, I do have some issues with this film. I feel that some of the plotting is a little ridiculous. For example, it's revealed that the basilisk kills people by looking at them in the eye but the reason that no one's died is that they only accidentally looked at him, not directly. That has got to be one of the biggest coincidences in the history of film! There's way more ridiculous plot points than that but I suggest you to watch 'Everything Wrong with Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets' on Youtube to get everything else.I also feel that a lot of the CGI in this film has become dated. I think the basilisk and the spiders look good but most of everything else is kinda dated.Overall, while it does have some stupid plot conveniences, it's a fun, engaging, and well-made mystery-fantasy film that should please the entire family. I'm gonna give it a 7/10.",7,0,1,15 September 2013
The Wolf of Wall Street," A Funny, Energetic Ride That Will Keep You Glued to the Seats till the Very End
","It's always funny to me how, so many people think that Scorsese only makes mafia and gangster flicks but when you actually look at his filmography, only like, 10% of his films revolve around gangsters or the mafia. Scorsese's recurring theme in his movies doesn't seem to be crime, but characters dealing with guilt. Whether it be Charlie from Mean Streets, Jake LaMotta from Raging Bull, Henry Hill from Goodfellas, or even Frank Pierce from Bringing Out the Dead. Since he's explored this theme so many times now, can Scorsese still deliver? Let's find out!The plot follows Jordan Belfort, a rich, highly successful stockbroker who starts out working a low-level job at an established Wall Street firm where he quickly becomes attracted to the world of stocks but loses his job due to Black Monday. Then, he starts his OWN brokerage firm titled 'Stratton-Oakmont' with his new friend, Donnie Azerto and from then on, the company skyrockets to the top by doing pump and dump scams and they live in a world full of sex and drugs while the FBI is hot on their trail.The thing that surprised me most about this movie was how FUNNY it was. When you think of Scorsese, you usually don't think of things that are funny but this movie is so over-the-top, it's hilarious. Every character in this movie is portrayed in an over-the-top fashion, they all do things you don't expect any normal human being to do. They have sex in the office in front of everyone, they get their dicks sucked in public, and they do more drugs than you could ever dream of in your wildest imaginations. This makes for a very funny and entertaining film because as you watch it, you can't help but laugh at how absurd it is but also fantasize about living the life these guys are living in.But while this is a comedy film, it also has a lot of heavy drama in it. This movie has a bit of a bipolar tone to it, one minute you might be laughing hysterically, and the next minute you might drop your jaw from being incredibly shocked at what you just saw. For example, there's a scene where Jordan gets so overwhelmed by the huge amounts of Quaaludes he took, he falls right down to the floor and can't walk and there's a lot of physical comedy in this scene as Jordan tries to make it down a set of stairs and we're laughing and enjoying ourselves for a while but then, all of a sudden, we see Jordan's baby daughter walk into the room, seeing her dad all high on Quaaludes and to quote RedLetterMedia, it feels like a punch to the gut and that's what the whole movie felt like to me. One minute there's laugh-out-loud comedy, next minute, there's heavy, intense drama that might get hard to watch. I'd have a problem with this if it felt very schmultzy and heavy-handed but Scorsese depicts it very raw and brutal so it feels natural and we don't find the shift of tone too jarring to watch.While Jordan Belfort is definitely a douchebag, DiCaprio surprisingly makes his character very likable for a lot of the film. He has this magnetic charm and confidence to him that makes the audience like and root for him even when he's doing terrible things and there's moments where we see essences of humanity to him such as when he gives his employee five times the money she needed to support her kids which are really important to make his character be at least SOMEWHAT sympathetic but at the same time, he never loses the douchebag attitude that makes you WANT to hate him, but you don't because deep down, we all sort of want to do the things he does throughout the film. Everyone else in the cast was strong too but the only real standouts were Jonah Hill as Donnie Azerto and Margot Robbie as Jordan's wife, Naomi. In this film, I didn't see Jonah Hill at all, I saw Donnie Azerto, THAT'S how good he was. And this has GOT to be the breakthrough for Margot Robbie, who seems very real and natural as someone who tries to TOLERATE her husband's wild behavior, but ultimately gives up as she realizes throughout what kind of man he is.The editing in this film is incredibly frenetic and energetic. There's a lot of slow-mo, freeze-frames, jump cuts, and there's a lot of moments where they'll make you think nothing went wrong for our protagonist, next thing you know, they cut BACK to show what REALLY happened and this really helps get you into the mind of Jordan Belfort as he's constantly on drugs and not always aware of what's going on.But despite how good those things were, there are some problems with the film. I've noticed that the script has a habit of spoon- feeding everything to the audience. Now, I understand that not everyone understands how Wall Street works so we need to explain it in a simple way for them to understand but I don't like how there's so many scenes where the visuals speak perfectly for itself but yet, they still have to narrate it for us. Come on Scorsese, we're not that stupid. I also felt that outside of Jordan, Donnie, Naomi, and Jordan's dad, Max Belfort, the rest of the characters just sort of came and went without us knowing them a whole lot. I wished we could've spent more time to know them a little better.But overall, this is a funny, energetic film that will keep your eyes glued to the screen by either making you laugh your balls off or by making you gasp at what's happening to our characters. If you are a Socrsese fan, or even just a fan of good cinema, you'll love it. 8/10",8,2,3,5 March 2014
The Wrestler," One of the Most Honest Movies Ever Made
","I gotta be brutally honest, I'm not the biggest fan of sports dramas. I really ain't. I mean, I liked Rocky, Raging Bull, The Fighter, and Warrior but generally, they bore me with all the clichés they are famous for. However, The Wrestler turned out to be a refreshing film in the genre as it doesn't feature the majority of clichés found in sport dramas. It's a brutally honest, depressing portrait of an old, broken-down wrestler named Randy(Mickey Rourke) who was once a star but now, lives a life of wrestling in local arenas for minimum wages, struggling to pay for his trailer with very few friends and loved ones. After a brutal hardcore match, Randy suffers a heart attack and survives but is told to quit wrestling, so he decides to get his life back together as he tries to reconcile with his estranged daughter, Stephanie, and get into a serious relationship with this stripper he's been befriending, Pam.What makes this film work is as I've said before, how honest it is. The story here isn't overly sentimental or sappy, it's rather frank about its characters and who they are. Randy is one of the most realistic protagonists I've ever seen and Mickey Rourke plays him beautifully. He's a flawed but kind soul who's ruined his life because of how dedicated he is to his passion and that's actually... kinda relatable. We've all made our lives a living Hell at one point because of our passion and Randy is the embodiment of that. He's a cautionary tale of what happens when we take our passion too far and end up sacrificing our personal lives for it.Everybody else in the cast is strong too, particularly Marisa Tomei who plays Pam with warmth and complexity. She plays her as someone who may have feelings for Randy as he respects her as a stripper rather than insulting her like her other customers but since she's a stripper, she has a difficult time slipping into a real relationship with him and Tomei conveys these emotions perfectly.Darren Aronofsky directed this film very naturally, he made use of hand-held camera-work excessively and while it's not something I'm usually fond of, Aronofsky makes it work and it adds realism to the film rather than distracting me like it often does. He makes the actors act very naturally, never going to far to the point of melodrama but enough emotion to let us feel something. It's a very hard balance to strike in this sort of film and he managed it very well. There's not a lot of music in the film but it makes the film feel more real and less manipulative because of it, so I thought it was a pretty bold artistic choice.The only thing that really bothers me about this film is the ambiguous ending. Now don't get me wrong, I have no problems with ambiguous endings. I loved the endings of The Shining and A Nightmare on Elm Street. However, I didn't really feel this film NEEDED an ambiguous ending as it would've been much more poetic to have Randy just die in the end. I don't know, maybe I'm just a simpleton.Overall, Aronofsky's natural direction and the strong cast makes for a wonderfully honest film that warns us about how obsessed we could be with our passions and how we could lose our lives because of it. 8/10. Great film, highly recommended.",7,1,1,30 December 2013
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Certainly Better than the Last Two but Still Flawed
","Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith is usually the film that people describe as being the only good Star Wars prequel out there. One of the most used words to describe this film is dark. People often call it the darkest film of the entire Star Wars saga, but is it a good movie outside of being dark? Let's find out!Firstly, the story. The story here is a lot more engaging than the previous two films. It lacks the boring, politics-based plot of The Phantom Menace and the cliché romance of Attack of the Clones. Here, the story is dark, intriguing, and quite tragic. Anakin goes through a lot of sh!t in this movie. He has visions of Padme dying in childbirth, the Jedi Council won't grant him master, and he learns that the only way to prevent Padme's death is by learning the Dark Side of the Force. He gets manipulated by Chancellor Palpatine overtime and ends up joining the Dark Side.What's interesting about his fall is that it isn't nearly as simple as the way Obi-Wan described it in A New Hope. He doesn't just ' get seduced by the Dark Side '. Okay, he kinda does but the reason he joins the Dark Side is because of love. He ultimately loved Padme too much and couldn't deal with loss. That's what the entire prequel trilogy has been building on, Anakin always had things be unfair for him. He left his mother at a young age and when he came back, he saw her die right in front of him. He fell in love when that was not allowed for a Jedi, he was not appreciated at the Jedi Council, and Padme was gonna die in her childbirth. He couldn't deal with loss so he ended up joining the Dark Side hoping to fix this issue. But ultimately, he was seduced with the power of the Dark Side and destroyed the thing he cared about the most, Padme. It's wonderfully Shakespearean and this alone makes the movie worth watching.Unlike most people, I think the acting in this movie is pretty good. Hayden Christensen is a lot less whiny and b!tchy than he was in Attack of the Clones and he expresses the pain of his character well. Ewan McGregor does a good job again emulating the voice of what Alec Guinness's Obi-Wan might have sounded like in his younger years. He plays Obi with a sense of maturity but you can still tell he's young in this film because he does have a sense of humor here and is generally looser than the older Obi. The showstealer here is Ian McDirmid. He's wonderfully over-the-top and creepy in this movie! I think he gives his strongest performance in the entire Star Wars saga. The one performance I didn't like is Natalie Portman. She's really fwcking annoying in this film with her high-pitched voice and melodramatic dialogue.The action is extremely quick-paced here and it's a lot of fun! I especially like the opening rescue of Chancellor Palpatine. It feels really adventurous and Saturday morning cartoon like, it's great! John Williams'score is amazing as usual. It makes the film feel really epic, tragic, and exciting. He also uses some music from the original Star Wars trilogy here which makes the two trilogies here feel more connected with each other.The visual effects are probably the best of what 2005 had to offer. They look super clean and detailed in this movie, it looks almost HD! Even watching this movie on DVD, you still get an amazing visual experience!So I actually like this movie but there are some things about it that bother me. I don't buy Padme dies because she lost the will to live. Really? She doesn't even care about the kids? I think the shooting and editing of this film is quite bland. Every single dialogue scene in this movie is shot with nothing but shoulder to shoulder shots! The editing is just basic shot reverse shot the entire time! To quote RedLetterMedia, it feels like it's edited and shot by a computer! Some of the dialogue is also pretty bad. They feel kinda soap-operaish and melodramatic at times and it doesn't help that it's delivered by Padme.Overall though, I like the drama, the action, the acting for the most part, the visuals, and the score so I'll give it a 7/10.",6,1,2,18 August 2013
The Silence of the Lambs," Disturbing yet Entertaining
","When it comes to horror films of the 90's, I can't think of many films as iconic as The Silence of the Lambs. While there were certainly other iconic horror films at the time such as The Sixth Sense and Scream, the one thing The Silence of the Lambs did that those films didn't, was win the Oscar for Best Picture. Not only that, but it also won for Best Actor for Anthony Hopkins, Best Actress for Jodie Foster, Best Adapted Screenplay for Ted Tally, and Best Director for Jonathan Demme. It also became the fourth highest-grossing film of 1991. So with all that, you expect something special, right? Well, is it? Let's take a look, shall we?The plot follows a young FBI trainee by the name of Clarice Starling who is pulled from her training academy to interview Hannibal Lecter, a former psychiatrist and incarcerated cannibalistic serial killer to find another serial killer by the name of Buffalo Bill under the order of Jack Crawford. After some interrogation and investigation, Bill abducts Catherine Martin, one of the U.S. Senator's daughter. Leaving it up to Starling to find Bill by dealing with the darkest of all minds, Hannibal Lecter.The appeal of Silence of the Lambs lies in its mix of realistic depictions of police investigation and serial killer antics while retaining a cinematic panache to keep things entertaining. The film depicts its police investigation very realistically with a great attention detail to the dead bodies and the way the main serial killer Buffalo Bill operates is actually pretty realistic. His motives are very opaque, never completely clear to the audience, just like how serial killers are to people in real-life. He's trying to make a dress with a woman's flesh throughout the film because he thinks he's a woman but you never get why he wants to kill people. You have to pay full attention to see what's behind his head. But at the same time, the film doesn't feel TOO realistic to the point where it's boring and dull to sit through, there's still a certain entertainment factor to this film. For one thing, the film is scary. While this isn't exactly the type of horror film you can have a good time with when you call over some friends while having a few beers, it still has plenty of good scares to keep you entertained from beginning to end(especially towards the end).But I think the main reason why this did so well was because of the characters. While most horror films would feature the serial killer as the most interesting character of the film while the main character is as dull as a rock, this film did something a little different. Clarice Starling in this film is equally interesting as the serial killers themselves because she's not just some girl who just happen to become a target for the killer somehow but instead, she's ASSIGNED to find the serial killer herself and actually has a personality and she actually goes through an arc. She starts out haunted from her childhood memory of seeing lambs being slaughtered so she feels guilty about seeing such a thing happen but not doing anything about it considering her dad was a cop and hears sounds of lambs screaming in her dreams but she overcomes this towards the end when she saves the senator's daughter and kills Buffalo Bill. And thankfully, they got a great actress to play this part, Jodie Foster. Foster has a believable intelligence to her that helps you buy her matching wits with Hannibal Lecter. It's great that the filmmakers chose not to cast the most attractive actress but instead, the one that could act.The rest of the characters are equally good. While Hannibal Lecter is certainly not a realistic portrait of a serial killer, he works well as this great, unstoppable force of evil that Clarice has to match wits with to find Buffalo Bill. Anthony Hopkins gives the performance of a lifetime here with all his creepy stares, sinister line deliveries, and wicked intelligence. Ted Levine is equally creepy and unsettling as Buffalo Bill, but in different ways. He feels a lot more like a realistic serial killer with his strange sexuality and cross-dressing habits. Scott Glenn is also convincing as the authoritative, determined Jack Crawford. Lastly, I want to mention Brooke Smith as Catherine Martin, the girl kidnapped by Buffalo Bill. I love how she starts out extremely terrified when she's captured just like anybody would but I like how her character actually tries to escape by threatening to kill Bill's dog if he doesn't let her out. Smith's fear and determination is very believable throughout the whole film.Overall, The Silence of the Lambs is a chilling, disturbing film that also has some excellent performances to spare. Great film. 10/10",8,5,11,20 April 2014
Monsters University," Pixar's Back!
","The Plot: Mike Wazowski is a young, aspiring scare major in Monsters University trying to pass scaring school. He meets up with a large, arrogant, blue monster called James P. Sullivan who's father was a famous scarer himself. Mike is hard-working, nerdy, and a know-it-all but just isn't scary while Sullivan is an academic failure but a naturally gifted scarer so naturally they become rivals, constantly trying to one-up each other in class. When they both fail the final exam, they team up to join the Scare Games which are a series of challenges that will test your abilities as a scarer to the fullest. Can they overcome their differences to work together?Pros:The story here is excellent. While at first, it seems just like any other underdog sport-story, it actually has a few surprises that I won't spoil. The animation is once-again top-notch. And lastly, the comedy is really funny. In fact, I think it's funnier than the original!Cons: The bullies are a bit too stereotypical for my tastes and the ending goes on a little too long. But other than that, not much I don't like from this film.Overall: Monsters University is a great comeback for Pixar after the disappointing Cars 2 and mediocre Brave. It's funny, creative, and actually has some genuine emotion. Which is something that a lot of kid's movies don't have(I'm looking at you, Alvin & the Chimpmunks).Final Verdict: 8/10",8,1,5,4 July 2013
Rear Window," Stylish Direction, Witty Dialogue, Memorable Characters, and a Suspenseful Climax Make For a Hitchcock Classic
","When it comes to filmmakers, very few have made as much of an impact as Alfred Hitchcock. He was the Master of Suspense, as he was called. He's influenced filmmakers across the board, from Steven Spielberg, to Christopher Nolan. He's also some of the most famous films ever made and one of them, is Rear Window.The plot of Rear Window is very simple. Basically, a professional photographer by the name of L.B. 'Jeff' Jeffries breaks his leg while getting an action shot at an auto race so he spends all his time observing his neighbors through his rear window and one night, after witnessing some mysterious acts from a man who lives across his apartment, he begins suspecting the man to be a murderer. At first, he tries to warn a detective, but the man doesn't believe him so it's up to Jeff to solve it on his own with his fiancée.Rear Window is a perfect example of a movie that survives on the strength of the direction. Normally, a film where you watch a guy watching someone through his window would be very boring, but Hitchcock's directing makes for a very witty, entertaining film with a strong intrigue throughout and a very memorable finale.The first thing that makes Hitch's directing special, is the way he puts us into the perspective of the main character Jeff. The camera in this film rarely ever leaves Jeff's apartment, we see the neighbors just like how the character sees them, through a window. And their dialogue always sounds as though we are REALLY hearing them from such distance by having more echo than the characters'voices in Jeff's apartment. The sound design also makes the neighborhood feel very alive by having numerous sounds in the background at once such as car horns blowing, birds chipping, pianos playing, people singing etc. The sound design also gets SCARY at times when we hear sounds of Thorwald presumably killing his wife. These things are probably not things you'd think about on a first-time viewing, but they help put you into Jeff's perspective perfectly.But outside of the gimmick of a film being entirely set in one room with a character looking out a window, the film also has a very strong, witty script that keeps the film entertaining from beginning to end. The characters in the film(even the neighbors) all have distinct, memorable personalities that keep the film afloat when it gets talky and the way they bounce off each other is very witty and memorable. The performances, themselves, are excellent. The performance of the actor playing Jeff is very important, because not only is he the audience surrogate, he's also the character whose perspective we see through from beginning to end and yet, Jeff is never BORING. Jeff is always interesting and compelling to watch because James Stewart is just such a likable, charismatic actor. He's funny, he's relatable, you care for him, he's great. Grace Kelly on the other hand, is simply STUNNING as Lisa Freemont, Jeff's fiancée. Her beauty and well, GRACE, perfectly contrasts with Jeff's adventurous attitude. And Thelma Ritter very likable and has excellent chemistry with Jimmy Stewart in the role of Stella, Jeff's nurse. We also have Judith Evelyn as Miss Torres or, as Jeff likes to call her, Miss Lonelyheart, a sad, lonely woman without a lover. This character doesn't have any lines but Evelyn manages to make her a very sad and sympathetic character without ever saying anything. Lastly, there's the murderer himself, Lars Thorwald, portrayed by Raymond Burr. Thorwald is a villain that really depends on the actor's look. He needs to have an intimidating, scary look to make for a memorable villain. Luckily, Burr pulls off this intimidating look on his face the entire time to make for a scary villain.The film also has a great, suspenseful climax. It involves Lisa basically sneaking into Thorwald's apartment to find evidence but as she's doing so, Thorwald comes right back to his place. The entire time, you're just BITING your nails in suspense because Jeff is not an action hero. He can't even walk, so we feel just as helpless as he does and we're just hoping that Lisa gets lucky the entire time. Although, there were some silly moments at the end such as Jeff using the flash on his camera to slow down Thorwald from getting to him by temporarily blinding him in the dark each time and the dated fast-forward editing and front projection shot of Jeffrey falling out his window.But overall, Rear Window is a great film with stylish direction, witty dialogue, memorable characters, and a great, suspenseful climax. 8/10",8,1,3,11 May 2014
Goodfellas," Possibly the Greatest Mob Portrayal in the History of Cinema
","Goodfellas is one of the most iconic films of all-time. It's often listed as one of the greatest movies of all-time and the famous 'funny guy' scene has been parodied countless times. It struck a huge impact on the genre and influenced countless gangster films that came after it. But why is that? Let's find out! Firstly, the story and how it's told. While the story in Goodfellas about the rise and fall of a gangster is nothing new, it's the way that Scorsese tells the story that makes it so compelling. The movie opens immediately with Henry, Jimmy, and Tommy driving late at night in the highway and then stopping their car to check their trunk and then... it turns out that there's a guy who's all bloodied up there and then Tommy stabs the guy a few times and Jimmy finishes him off by shooting him at point blank and then boom! The movie starts and it never slows down. What's so effective about this opening is that it immediately grabs your attention. We don't start out with any boring exposition dialogue, we get thrown right in the middle of the murder and it makes the audience want to find out why they killed this guy. It's a brilliant opening scene and it's one of the greatest in all of cinema in my opinion.The rest of the film goes through the life of Henry Hill from his teenage years working at a mafia-owned cabstand to dealing drugs behind their back at a brisk, fast pace. This movie has a lot of plot and it could've been really long and boring if it was made by a weaker director but Scorsese keeps the plot going at a fast pace and uses a lot of interesting shooting and editing choices to keep the film interesting. The first half of the film shows the positive side of being a mobster as we get to see Henry take Karen to the Copacabana, steal trucks, rob an airport, and beat the snot out of a man for touching his girl. A lot of people say that this film glamorizes the lifestyle of a gangster from watching this half but I think it's necessary because it makes it believable why Henry would want to join the mob in the first place and it makes the audience enjoy the lifestyle while watching it. The thing that makes this part of the film so enjoyable is how fast-paced it is. We go through all this plot and information in a fast-paced manner so we never get bored in such a long film. Also, the shooting and editing in this film is excellent. Scorsese shot and edited this film with a sense of intensity and it works because it keeps the audience interested rather than if they just used flat, static shots the entire time like the Star Wars prequel.The second half is when the sh!t starts hitting the fan. This is the part in the film where things start going really bad for the characters. Tommy gets whacked for killing Billy Batts, Henry gets arrested for dealing drugs, and Jimmy becomes a paranoid wreck over an airport robbery and starts killing members of his crew out of fear of them leading him to his demise. What's so great about this part of the film is that you really feel the fear and anxiety the characters are feeling. When Henry gets released from prison and gets really paranoid about getting whacked for dealing drugs, you feel the same way because you care about his character. It's quite an accomplishment to make you feel for a mobster/drug dealer.I haven't talked about the performances yet so I might as well here. Ray Liotta is really underrated in this film. He plays Henry as a douchebag and not a nice guy but we do see his humanity when he sees Tommy murdering people. He makes us both pity him when he's caught dealing drugs and find him despicable when he's cheating on Karen and it's sad that when people talk about this movie, they never bring up his performance because he's actually really great in this film. Robert De Niro is the middle ground character of the trio. He's not as violent as Tommy but he doesn't have as much of a conscience as Henry and he plays it well, showing both the ruthless gangster side as well as the respectable side. The actor who gets the most attention for this film is Joe Pesci. He plays Tommy as an explosive, violent psychopath who would kill you just for looking at him the wrong way and yet, he's still really funny because of the way he talks. He's a joy to watch in this film!Lastly, I want to bring up Scorsese's choice of music in this film. The music he chooses in this movie consists mainly of 70's rock & roll and pop music and they fit with every scene in this movie. When Henry's dating Karen, Bobby Vinton's Roses are Red and it helps in creating a romantic scene. When Henry's snorting coke, a rock and roll song abruptly comes on and it fits in with the intensity the character's feeling. All in all, the music choices in this movie were great and I suggest you to go buy the soundtrack.Overall, the amazing direction, shooting, editing, acting, pacing, and music choices all add up to making one of the greatest films of all- time. I'm gonna give it a 10/10.",9,0,1,31 August 2013
