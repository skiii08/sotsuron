The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Americans really need to improve their education system
","... if the current high school system really is so traumatic to most of their citizens. The Perks of being a Wallflower is yet another movie about a traumatic period of American kids' life called 'high school'. As if we did not have enough of these already.If you can get over this trope, the story itself is on the border of OK/boring. None of the characters are really that interesting and the events depicted in the movie are more or less meaningless: gay characters have troubles, kids experiment with drugs and endanger their lives in traffic, relationships fail... To be fair, the traumas are not all caused by high school, but have their roots in the earlier lives of some of the characters. But these seem rather tagged on to make the characters more dramatic and the cases are slightly too numerous to make them believable.",4,3,7,3 May 2013
The Mummy," Surprisingly good!
","I wasn't expecting much when I started watching this movie, but it soon proved to be a good old-fashioned adventure flick with great humour and boyish charm. I had been afraid that the movie would be based on its special effects, but the character interaction was absolutely great and the dialogue had some hilarious one-liners. A rare find. 8/10",8,2,2,17 March 2003
Romeo + Juliet," Attempted, but failed
","Perhaps I saw this film a few years too late, but it did not really affect me that much. I found the chance in the time and place that the story takes place rather boring and it did nothing for the movie as an experience. I got the feeling that it was just an attempt to draw interest from the media and public, rather than to bring something new to the story. Acting is rather nice, but it was hard to see diCaprio as Romeo - again, a rising, if not famous, boy-actor was used just to draw attention to the flick. I'd recommend some older version of the story, if not the original written story, for those who find the story interesting... 4/10",4,1,2,6 May 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Simply brilliant, I say!
","Others have already praised this movie so much that I will settle on some points that made it perfect for me and give some criticism for details that bothered me. (Minor spoilers ahead, so don't read if you haven't seen it yet.)First, the acting and the camera work (incl. special effects w/ computer renderings) were stupendous. Second, the plot of the classic story was followed very well and the makers had avoided the trap of 'updating' the plot (like in Costner's Prince of Thieves). There's not much one could have done to make this movie better, but some details come to mind: The omission of Tom Bombadil is one of them, although I understand the reasoning behind the decision. Another lacking detail was the scene where Gandalf escaped from Saruman: there was no explanation of where the bird came that took him away (wasn't it supposed to be Radagast the Brown?). Including some explanation of the Istari might have been useful here to tune in those watchers who have not read their Tolkien (sacrilege, I admit).All in all, I suspect that those who have not read Tolkien's work or studied the maps of Middle-Earth may have been left a bit baffled by the fast recap of the history in the beginning of the movie and the references to geographic locales when the fellowship is discussing the various routes that they could take when travelling to towards their goal. Perhaps the characters could have pulled out a map of some sort to make those discussions clearer.Another thing that bothered me was the amount of action the movie threw to the viewers faces: the book offered descriptions of the nature and the journey as well as discussions between the characters that alleviated the scenes between action sequences, whereas the movie seems to rely heavily on the action part of the story. Perhaps too much.But, despite my critique, I think this is The Best movie that I have ever seen and I expect that the second and third part will follow the same excellent route and take the trilogy into the annals of history. And, perhaps, then a prequel about Isildur might be in order...10/10 for this one.",10,0,0,7 January 2002
The Amazing Spider-Man," Shallow and meaningless
","For me, the biggest failures of this movie were: 1. Shallowness We never really get inside the character's heads and most of the dramatic scenes (with Uncle Ben giving advice, dying etc.) are shallow and uninvolved - merely doing lip-service to the events ('oh, yeah, and this happened as well and we should make a scene out of it').2. Villain The villain was a shallow shell and ultimately very uninteresting.3. Aunt May She seemed to have something to do up until Uncle Ben died, but then she really did not do anything else but stand around. We didn't even see her grieve properly. So, shallow again.4. Bad love story The movie was long, but still failed to tell us how Peter fell in love with Gwen. Certainly he stuttered around her a lot, but they never seemed to actually talk about anything or make a real connection.",4,1,2,27 October 2012
Event Horizon," A seriously underrated piece of film
","Like some others, I was really surprised about how bad a grade this film has got in IMDB. This movie was one of the rare horror films that have actually affected me in any way. The build-up of horror was way better than in the later Alien movies and the Hell sequences were really disturbing (like they should be). The acting was very nice, as were the special effects. Of course, there were some holes in the plot, but one tends to expect them from horror movies. A fine piece of horror, in my opinion. 7/10 from me.",7,0,1,7 March 2002
The Dark Knight," Another sequels that pales in comparison to the original
","I expected a lot from TDK after seeing the spectacle that was Batman Begins. Unfortunately, TDK failed in most respects - there's not a scene in the movie that makes you care about the fates of any of the characters. The characterizations are very shallow and there's no chemistry between the main characters. Simply put, the movie doesn't involve the viewer in any way.TDK is undoubtedly the darkest Batman movie made thus far and the production values are first-rate as far as it comes to editing and filming and set design. Thus, it is a pity that the story and characters fail to deliver.",5,5,11,15 October 2008
Annie Hall," This one had nothing new to say
","Woody Allen has made better movies than this. For some reason this one seemed like a product of a recycling plant of all the ideas from his other movies and offered nothing new. The flashbacks to the main character's past relationships, comments directed to the camera, questions directed to the passer-bys in the streets etc. have all been seen before and offered nothing new to the viewer. I expected more from the director and I was really let down by what I saw on the screen. I gave it 3/10, because I could not but compare the movie to the others, far better ones, that W.Allen has made.",3,5,15,4 October 2001
"Girl, Interrupted"," Good Story of a Disturbed Girl
","I thought this movie was based on a good and relatively touching story. Of course, it was difficult to identify oneself with the main characters, but it gave one a chance to concentrate on the psychology of the main characters, and hope that they would be explored further (which they weren't). I wouldn't watch this movie again, but as a one time experience, it was a decent flick. Ryder and Jolie gave excellent performances, Jolie being even better than Ryder.6/10",6,1,2,9 March 2003
The Mission," Completely trivial
","I didn't like this movie. It had nothing to say. The characters were one dimensional and their motives were not explored at all. For some reason the character played by deNiro had no depth at all and his crying scene did not affect me at all. Only the background music told me that this was supposed to be a significant event. But, for me, it didn't seem so. The movie would have needed more human interaction all around to make those so-called meaningful scenes to actually mean something. And the ending was the worst of it all. Supposedly dramatic, but the only thing that affected me was the realisation that 'that was it!?'.Only 2/10 for this one.",4,11,27,29 October 2001
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Best of the Prequels
","This movie was definitely the best of the three prequels for the Star Wars saga. Unfortunately, that doesn't mean that it was a great movie. Unlike in the two first installments, the Revenge of the Sith managed to bring forth my emotions at a couple of points, but I still could not but laugh whenever the screen was decorated by a so-called romantic scene. Lucas still doesn't know a better way to describe love and emotions than making the characters say them aloud or staring silently into the distance...Still, I was pleased by this movie and my only wish is that Lucas had made episodes I&II into a single movie (spanning the childhood of Anakin) and not filled them up with useless and meaningless scenes. This third movie shows the strength of a focused story versus the incoherence that episodes I&II represented. 6/10",5,3,5,2 June 2005
Contact," Great movie - except for the ending!
","I loved this movie for many of the reasons others have already stated, the conflict between science and religious beliefs. However, I feel that the ending of the movie might have had more impact if certain things had not been made clear to the viewer. Uncertainty over the true situation might have been a better approach.",8,0,2,16 May 2001
