The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Far better than the reviews let on
","First, I'm assuming that you've seen the other two Hunger Games movies...else there's not much point to sit through Mockingjay Part I (MJPT1). Second, I'm assuming that you're not a huge Transformers fan and/or didn't think that Pacific Rim nor Sharknado were the height of cinematic perfection. After the first two movies, we already know a lot of back story and setup/conflict between Katniss and Pres Snow. Mockingjay PtI then introduces us to District 13 (her destination as mentioned at the end of Catching Fire) and the District 13 society (only lightly limned in MJPT1). We know there's a war coming and MJPT1 sticks to the story line as outlined in The HG book(s) to a great degree.In terms of the movie and expectations, I never got the least bit bored nor did I feel I was just being dragged through Pt1 primarily to suck money out of me. There's a lot of there-there to be discussed, outlined, and philosophized about and, if you pay any attention, lots of action, too. Sure, this installment is a lot darker but that's how the story plays out. If you compare the structure of THG to LOTR, you know what the protagonist has to do: The Capital is Mordor; Katniss is Frodo; she's the Mockingjay and he's the ring-barer. Neither has an enviable job -- just a sadly necessary, burdensome one. You know where Katniss eventually has to go and MJPT1 does an excellent job of setting this in motion.",9,4,23,5 December 2014
Alien 3," You must see the extended Assembly Cut before rendering an opinion
","Shocked. Surprised. Not exactly elated though. Nonetheless, the Assembly Cut, which puts back in 33 minutes of critical filming done by David Fincher (regardless of whether he sanctioned the Assembly Cut), radically transforms the commercial release into a much more coherent and much less annoying outing. This film hearkens back to the first Alien movie in tonality, though with a resolute grimness. It's not exactly pleasant or fun. Additionally, you have the many problematic plot issues assuming that Alien 3 is supposed to follow Aliens... And the killing off of key characters doesn't make any sense unless somehow they refused to participate in the sequel. Actually, the entire setup for this sequel doesn't make any sense... Who the heck sanctioned such obvious plot violations? Still, I'm giving this a 6/10 because the movie shows a believable and unique consistent vision, however dour, and there's much fine acting to be had.",6,0,0,14 December 2010
Mission: Impossible III," A whole lot better than you'd expect
","I'm beginning to understand Tom Cruise -- a man with his emotions so out there, he's out of control a lot of the time -- and that's a great attribute to MI:III where his intensity's constantly on display. Great action sequences, expertly edited, perfectly paced. I don't want to give away any of the plot details (which is somewhat difficult since I need to generate 10 lines here, considering there's not much in the way of deep philosophical discussion points!) Of course, some plodding filler material interrupts the action, but doesn't doom this excellent mindless fun flick. And speaking of evil intensity, Mr. Capote (Philip Seymour Hoffman) plays off Cruise effectively without out trivializing the rivalry. An enjoyable piece of action fluff best seen on the big screen.",8,0,1,8 November 2006
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," One of the Worst of 1999
","Episode I has my vote as one of the worst, if not the worst major hyped release of 1999.  It makes a mockery of Star Wars and gives a bad name to every actor in it.  Where does one begin?  Wooden, leaden acting from start to finish.  No emotional content anywhere.  Incredibly pointless special effects.  Extremely loud soundtrack.  Pointless fight scenes.  Stereotyped aliens (note the slights to Asians and Semites, among others).  The only redeeming aspects of this bomb are the incredible eye-popping special effects.  And yes, the costuming was very creative.  'So What.'  I certainly hope this dog is only released as a pan-and-scan on VHS so others will avoid it.  It's a hive full of scum and villainy..or something like that.",2,0,1,5 January 2000
Spartacus," An Epic in the Roman Style
","One may not love Spartacus the movie yet still love Spartacus the man.  The thousand cliches unleashed though Roman perfidy could not stop the note-perfect acting of the lead characters.  Kirk Douglas does such a fine job balancing command, tenderness, self-doubt, and resolve.  The bright, insightful screenplay assisted by blacklisted Trumbo rings with both fey cynicism and honest galantry...an unusual combination.  Long is the movie and the love you'll have for Spartacus at its end.  Thank you Universal, et. al. for restoring this classic!",10,1,3,9 February 2004
Minority Report," A mixed bag
","This movie could have been so much better had Steven Spielberg not been aping James Cameron at the wrong moments. Tom Cruise does a great job as the lead; always believable, always cool. Can't fault him. Interesting plot, if a bit strained. So, what's wrong? The action scenes are completely unnecessary. What's the point to either the rocket packs in the alley scene or the robotic factory fight scene? Ans: there isn't any. A waste of talent and time. So, what else? The opening sequence strains credulity that it would take so long to trace a name to a particular address given the obviously advancements in computer technology. This is the same basic error Spielberg committed in AI regarding David eating food at the table (what, no safeguards?) and David being allowed to run free without being tracked (what, no LoJack?). If you're going to paint a consistent sci-fi picture, you'd better make sure your hobgoblins of little minds fly their butterflies in formation. Yeah, Mr. Anderton's on the run and the lab doesn't bother to deactivate his retinal scans? Sure.",7,1,2,23 January 2003
Gravity," Visually stunning but also a bit contrived and vacuous
","I recently went back to rewatch this movie. As everyone has mentioned, including the Academy, the visuals are stunning. What an amazing technical tour de force. The sound and sound editing set benchmarks, too. That said, the dialog and long (long) interregnums between the visual spectaculars are flat out yawners. I'm also finding physics flaws in how certain scenes were handled. Given the precision of the CG team I'm shocked these were allowed to stand. Regardless this movie still enthralls. See it in high def on the largest screen possible.",8,3,4,30 July 2019
Se7en," Overrated, predictable, with lots of bad acting by Brad Pitt
","This is a top 250 movie?!?  Brad Pitt's acting is shallow, stereotypical, and not nuanced.  He does the California surfer-dude routine throughout the entire movie as though some uneducated simpleton dolt could wind up with his job...sorry, but I don't think so.  The plot line relies on a connect...the...dots methodology -- contrived, and largely predictable with action interspersed with banal social dialogue.  I gave this 4/10 mostly for the fine acting of Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman.  Very silly -- Brad Pitt's acting had me laughing...and not in a good way.   In defense of Mr. Pitt, I think he was badly miscast since I've seen other movies in which he does at least a respectable job.",4,8,14,24 February 2004
Monster," Superb Acting but That's Not Enough to Make a Great Movie
","I have mixed feelings about Monster. First and foremost, Charlize Theron's acting is beyond comprehension in its perfection. She has become Aileen Wuornos (whom she portrays) in a way so intense and so completely it literally scared me. Tour-de-force performances like hers inhabit a realm far above mere mortal efforts: Oscar worthy / Oscar won. Christina Ricci's performance left me cold, though I understand her underplayed / understated performance might have been more in keeping with the facts -- still, it seemed that Charlize Theron owned each and every scene the two of them were in. I suggest a case of bad miscasting / directing / scripting. Secondly, I understand that certain plot points weren't accurate regarding the genesis of the crimes Aileen Wuornos committed...and that's a key to making the character much more sympathetic. If true, then the producers have done the public and the true victims of her crimes an unconscionable disservice. Finally, one has to judge whether the movie was worth watching. It's an uncomfortable ride on many levels. I recommend the movie solely for Charlize Theron's masterful performance and will leave the other aspects of the movie up for your consideration.",7,2,4,3 December 2009
The Maze Runner," Ill-conceived; ridiculously plotted 'boys' movie
","The entire premise of this silly excuse to do a boys' adventure movie lacks the one thing that would really matter: A valid reason for making it. Nothing in this movie makes any sense, and you find out at the very end why nothing makes sense and then you realize you've been ripped off: The idiots who created/wrote this movie don't give a hoot about rationality, don't give a hoot about consistency, and nothing in this movie matters to any degree....all they wanted was an excuse to do some CGI and some action sequences that involve each and every male coming-of-age cliché imaginable. How they roped Patricia Clarkson into this sad movie is beyond me (perhaps Dame Judy Dench laughed too loudly when she read its premise).",2,0,1,8 October 2015
Passengers," If you can handle an absurd setup, this film delivers on many levels
","Passengers is almost a set piece given how few characters inhabit the screen at any time. Only JLaw's 'Hunger Games' histrionics jarred me (she always seems to be shouting with the same intensity and with the same facial expressions)...but otherwise she was spot-on. I found the acting, especially by Chris Pratt, very believable. Chris Pratt has some absurd facial prosthetics which are rather laughable, but he has a very natural demeanor though a bit too teary-eyed at times. He plays a hunk who's not self-aware of his hunkiness. // Anyway, what truly bothered me throughout the movie was the total ridiculousness of the setup that propels the story forward. You have to buy an absurd premise for the rest of the movie to make any sense. Very annoying and shows, IMHO, lazy script writing. BTW, beautiful special effects throughout.",7,2,4,15 September 2017
The Hunger Games," Gary Ross is a Genius; It's the best movie possible from the material
","Let's separate out the source material itself from the extreme dedication of the production team to get the nuances of Suzanne Collins's The Hunger Games right in tone while shrinking the novel into the confines of cinema. In the latter regard, Gary Ross did a superb job in script writing / directing. He's balanced the need to keep the storyline moving with the need to keep true to the novel's underpinnings. I've watched the movie a couple more times before writing this review. I find nothing superfluous, bloviated, unnecessary. It's a compact story that's equally divided between setup and execution. What's truly sad: Imagine had Gary Ross been the director of Prometheus. Yes -- Gary Ross is a genius. What about the acting? The only weakness is the lack of chemistry between Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and Liam Hemsworth (Gale). Liam seems a miscast hunk out of place in an ugly dour world. Too bad they didn't cast Miley Cyrus as Katniss's younger sister. But there's a much larger problem: The source material. The audience has to keep swallowing incredible incongruities just so we can be continually hit over the head with multi-level anti-authoritarian messages. This is an amoral society on steroids that exists only as a foil to propel the thematics. We can't help but become angry at the atrocities foisted on Katness and her conscripted compatriots. Maybe I would have understood better if Katness had worn a six-pointed star. So, I'm giving this movie 9 stars largely on the excellent execution / beautiful realization of Gary Ross's vision.",9,0,4,31 July 2014
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Perfect; and Perfectly Vile
","Brilliant is oft overused; but Trey Parker's sublime parody and satire of all that is sacred is an endless laughfest of balanced shock and splendor. The cursing's totally out of control; but so is this over-the-top movie. One could detail the movies and social mores that South Park cynically destroys one by one...but that gives away too much of the plot.  I'm sure when the Decline and Fall of American Civilization is eventually written some millennia from now, this movie will get a mention. Until then, laugh until you fall over.This movie is NC-17 at least.  Don't take your kids!",10,0,0,5 January 2000
Cloverfield," It's terrific FX but not compelling (no serious spoilers)
","So, I got to tell 'ya here: This is a monster movie. Does that qualify as a spoiler? I guess it must because the movie starts with a vacuous yuppie going away party with just about the least interesting (though still handsome / pretty) set of Millennials ever... And suddenly they're thrust into a run-for-your-life disaster movie staring huge robots that can transform themselves into cars and such and there's a very distracting babe...oh wait, wrong movie but nearly the same idea. There's random, needless, and apolitical destruction everywhere and the Millennials are on the run with only one slightly guilty (and enormously dumb) rescue operation underway. Hey: They're the only ones left running around, practically, in a city of zillions. Why the seven stars: I loved the FX. Wow. It's 2008 and it looks real, filmed in cinema verité. Impressive! You could easily imagine yourself right there (but, unfortunately, with a less pretty girl friend or less handsome bf, but who's counting). Other than moderately irrational behavior by the protagonist, the other actions are real in context (btw, there's no way this could have happened in LA because everyone would be giving the monster a shoulder shrug and a kumbaya and, besides, the monster would have been stuck on the 405 FOR HOURS ON END). Ultimately, as many other reviews have said, this is not much more than Blair Witch with a bang.",7,0,1,19 April 2019
Crash," I hear false sentiment ringing / crashing everywhere
","I have issues with this movie.Crash has two absolutely superb scenes that sealed its Academy Award (the car crash rescue and the locksmith daughter shooting) and many other riveting and highly contrived but well-directed 'crashes'. Yes, contrived, overwrought, and largely unbelievable. Ridiculous interactions designed for maximum emotional impact. This movie doesn't teach us anything about real race relations and I didn't find its confessional style to be anything more than convenient crutches for artificial conflict. The absurdities boggle the mind (extremely/overly literate car jackers, a DA's wife who throws racially tinged vitriol designed to unelect her husband, a producer's seemingly intelligent but down-on-the-boner wife who thinks her husband could somehow magically handle the well-armed LAPD (better speak to Rodney King!) and his equally unbelievable 180 degree turnaround with a gun in his face...the list goes on and on).This whole movie resembles Pulp Fiction in feel and incongruity, except that Crash takes its subject matter far too seriously (a mistake *not* made by Q. Tarantino) and Crash bloviates its subject matter like a miasmic Santa Ana.Yet, I can see why this won Best Picture over Brokeback Mountain, for that movie, too, rings its own falsehoods, but much more quietly. Had just the directors been reversed, Brokeback would have turned into an amazingly (and much more interesting) campy romp/slutfest and Ang Lee would have won more academy awards that should be possible.",7,1,4,29 May 2006
Pan's Labyrinth," Overrated and I'll Explain Why
","I can understand why so many critics have been swept away by this contrasting tale of a brutal regime and the lovely but parallel dangerous fantasy world imagined by our young girl heroine. It's a 'pretty' film balancing the real world against a not overly-CGIed imaginary one. But here's the crux of the problem: What is the point of this film? What deeper and interesting issues can the audience explore through the vision of the director and his story? My response: None. A simple tale and a simple vision of escaping from a desperate reality. We have the extreme visually graphic brutality of the general against many softer feminine elements (and virtuous feminine strength shown over and over again). So, good versus evil? A young girl's fantasy dashed? The 'clever' blurring of her fantasy vs. reality? Nice touches that don't amount to anything deeper or more meaningful.On another note, I found the brutal elements too disgusting to watch and again wondered what was the point? A vicious villain's villain, yes. Geez, I never would have imagined that a man could be so cruel for no apparent reason than the absolute drive to conquer and dominate. That was some learning experience.",3,9,25,18 January 2007
Pacific Rim," Better or Worse Than Sharknado?
","The similarities between Pacific Rim and Sharknado go far beyond their lithe, telegenic screenplays and nuanced character-driven plots. Practically Shakespearean in their world-views and intricate family dynamics, both movies will keep you on the edge of your seat as plot twists have you guessing right up until the end on the big 'who done it' question. Oh certainly, first-rate special effects added to well-crafted acting with so many layers of emotional depth you'd think its respective sea creatures were pipe-lined straight from Citizen Kane, or perhaps The Godfather, or maybe a bit of both. Really, who's to say which picture will garner the most Golden Globes or Academy Awards this year. My bet's on ILM's splendorous work in Pacific Rim although I've got to say Sharknado's sharks really projected tremendous amounts of fear-inducing horror that weren't quite the equal of the more anime-inflected denizens of Pacific Rim. I suggest you see both films in a double feature and decide for yourself.",2,7,9,7 January 2014
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The Triumph of Technology Over Movie Making
","It's all been said before...but I'll say it again.  The acting by Natalie Portman and Hayden Christenen is so wooden, flat, and devoid of feeling I suspect they're the true subject of Attack of the Clones.  (BTW, the bonus disk showed an impassioned speech by Ms. Portman to the Senate, but it was a deleted scene...too bad).  Dazzling special effects that affect no one, lengthy scenes plodding on with senseless bloodless violence borrowed from every movie that came before it, etc. etc.  No heart, no soul, no real tension.    Not even a naked love scene between Natalie Portman and Ewan McGregor would have redeemed this bloated barge of ILMish clone-mongering (well, hey, this would have merited at least skipping to that chapter before tossing the DVD).  Yes; the final fight scenes do have some of that ole'time magic, but why suffer the first two hours for the last 10 minutes?  Advice from The Force:  'George, you don't need to direct the next Star Wars; George, you don't need to be involved in the screen play; George, go home and take care of your kids and relax!'",2,5,11,8 May 2003
The Matrix Revolutions," Better than the lousy reviews would have you believe
","So; I read all the horrible reviews and decided to go anyway.  You know what?  It's a lot better than I expected and it's not simply a case of being impressed vs. lowered expectations.  Revolutions is better than Reloaded. For one thing, the acting is significantly less wooden, though Trinity still is playing it too unemotionally (as is Neo).  The movie is far from perfect compared to the brilliant first outing and the plot lapses/confusions constantly annoy (try figuring out the Oracle's story).  Nothing compares to the car chase scene in Reloaded.  That said, all the animation/CGI constantly amazes.  The weak ending will leave you mad, literally.",7,0,0,24 November 2003
Man of Steel," Loud, 'Action' oriented, steals from other films liberally
","I'd give Man of Steel an even lower rating, but I found the acting to be marginally credible (I thought Kevin Costner did a particularly good job and Russell Crowe wasn't bad either). There's not a whole lot of depth to any of the goings-on tho. MOS steals from a bunch of other movies. The early counsel scene is taken directly from the 2nd/3rd Matrix movie. MOS / Henry Cavill stole scenes directly from Wolverine's X-Files formative persona. The fight scenes especially at the end stole directly from the 3rd Matrix movie (I really thought Neo and Smith were going to fly by for cameos). The City sequences reminded me of Independence Day. Lois Lane (Amy Adams) reminded me of Kate Mara in House of Cards (but with more clothes on). I know the plot's driven by the comic book, but can't we do better in the rationale department? Folks on Krypton just got stupid one afternoon? Hey, speaking of the Matrix, I see MOS borrowed the Matrix's general for essentially the same role. Don't forget to bring a pair of good earplugs to this loud-fest of predictable CGI-dominated caped extravaganzas.",3,6,12,23 June 2013
Spider-Man," A Great Tobey, Much Fine Acting, but M.J. Needs Those Acting Lessons
","Enjoyed Spider-Man, mostly for the nuanced performance of Tobey M.  Willem Dafoe was a perfect villain, with comic touches appropriate to the overall theme of the movie.  Unfortunately, Ms. Dunst *really* needs to follow through on getting her acting lessons, as her M.J. character suggests.  Her delivery is so wooden, so flat, it's inappropriately hilarious.  How could Spidey be in love with a stacked piece of redheaded cardboard?  There's no chemistry there whatsoever and it's to Tobey's credit he faked it for her the whole time.  PlayStation-like animation detracts from some of the scenes, but the sweeping cinematography thrills at every angle (despite the twin towers' removal).",7,0,0,12 October 2002
Aliens," Great movie regardless of your sci-fi orientation
","This is a great sequel though James Cameron chucks the creepy Ridley Scott atmosphere for a more action-oriented format. One of the opening sequences shows an unaccustomed brilliance -- the scene where the face shot of Ripley dissolves/merges into the picture of the planet is of such loveliness, it's jaw-dropping every time I see it. This is much more than a typical 'schlurp and munch' movie. Great action, great dialog, great plot pick up from the original. Yes, the Marines are rather stereotypical, but at least they're a fun bunch and have some depth and differentiation. Ms. Weaver got the Oscar nod just for her delivery of that classic line 'Bitch!' line. Too bad she was up against Marlee Matlan for Children of a Lesser G-d. BTW, I don't like the directors cut. The original actually removed superfluous scenes and there's no way to cleanly skip over them in the directors 'restored' cut. Sorry; the studio got it right the first time and the movie is better without the extra scenes with just one exception: The scene where you find out about Ripley's daughter (to establish a more reasonable justification for Ripley going back for Newt). Otherwise, the other junk should be jettisoned.",10,1,2,23 January 2003
American History X," Edward Norton Gives a Great Performance
","Edward Norton gives, at least for most of the movie, and incredibly powerful and scary portrayal of a Nazi skinhead, replete with the directed violence and deep-well of hatred of minorities, etc. we would normally associate with this character. What makes his performance special is his laser-like intensity brought to all things skinhead, at least for the pre-prison part of the movie. The movie starts to unravel during Norton's transitional phase to someone more sensitive and socialized. That transition isn't given enough context and his prison 'friendship' isn't sufficient to believe he's a changed man. It's all too convenient a plot crutch. Norton's asked to make this shape-shifting believable, but the screenplay lets him down. Nevertheless, Norton's excellent performance deserves to be watched regardless of plot quibbles. N.B. I didn't read the other IMDb reviews of this movie before writing mine (which is the way it should be) -- so I'm now curious to see if others had the same conclusion.",7,1,2,14 January 2005
District 9," A misadventure of social sci-fi schlock
","I just saw this film with five other sci-fi buffs on Friday Aug 14, 2009. We all had the same opinion: Wildly overrated, absurd plot, over-the-top political PC message that gets garbled with the underlying and ultimately unimportant alien sci-fi plot line, and finally an overreaching script and director that focuses on short-term shock value and FX rather than the need to integrate plot lines in a new and innovative manner. So many scenes and concepts 'borrowed' directly from other movies (space ship shots straight from Independence Day; transformation scenes from The Fly; vivisection footage from more than one Nazi war movie; robotics right from Transformers; building raids from Bourne Identity), etc.The plot holes are huge: Alien weaponry that the aliens just don't want to use unless necessary? Aliens stranded in space except for one smart one...and why didn't that alien do something? Then why were there so many weapons on the ship in the first place? The unnecessarily inhuman treatment of the aliens in such an extreme way as to not make any sense whatsoever. The absurdity of the government's relocation asking the aliens to sign papers? I mean who thinks up this out-of-context ridiculousness? The entire weapons angle screamed of stereotyped 1984-think as though Neanderthals were in charge of everything and the unnecessary scene where the protagonist shoots an alien with one of their weapons (as though he should complain much) is there only, again, for the shock value.Sorry, I can't give this movie points just for trying to shove a bunch of apartheid PC points down my throat in an incoherent and unconnected manner. Never did the movie highlight a coherent point of view or give any socio-economic insights as to the relationship between humans and the aliens that would provide adequate underpinnings for justifying their horrible over-the-top prejudicial treatment.",2,24,52,17 August 2009
Before Sunset," I Frankly Don't Understand All of the Fuss
","Maybe one needs to watch Before Sunrise prior to viewing Before Sunset, but I would consider that to be a fatal flaw of any sequel issued so long after the first installment. I found this movie fairly disappointing given its high ratings: The first two-thirds of the movie truly moves at a french glacial pace and the dialog just goes on and on...what's the purpose? Avoidance? Lite repartee a long nine years after their intense tryst? The build up happens far too slowly to sustain interest; it isn't until the limo ride to the airport (via her apartment) that the emotionally significant part of the movie finally kicks in...and when it does, it's very good. Despite the pacing problems, all the dialog is well written and delivered naturally as though the actors had written the lines themselves (which, as you know, they did). This movie would have been much better had they jumped from the book signing (which also dragged on for too long) to the cafe and then to its ultimate conclusion. I didn't mind the movie leaving the conclusion open ended...If I were Uma, I'd have dumped him, too.",7,2,6,22 January 2005
28 Days Later...," Garbage (Rage Against the Garbage)
","This movie is garbage from start to finish. It starts with nary an original idea then goes on to borrow from every science fiction end-of-the-world / virus / contagion / zombie scenario imaginable. The plot is ludicrous and silly and the entire primate break-in scene totally laughable in a Plan 9 From Outer Space way. Every scene rips off another horror movie in a worse way. I'm surprised the guy didn't wake up 28 days later and yell out 'Brains! Brains!' Who produced this poor excuse for a horror movie? Do I need to recount the number of silly scenes and their poor execution? OK: The guy wakes up 28 days later and, upon encountering the hungry zombies, doesn't even bother to ask what's going on. Yeah, sure. Later, hmmm... let's see...should I light a candle in an otherwise dark house to go looking for parental reminiscences with the zombies out and about? Who would have expected the zombies to attack? Duh. And of course, we need the obligatory shopping experience (where were the zombies then?) Every clichéd idea played out in a clichéd way (like the guy grabbing his two lovelies in the middle of the protected army compound when he found out they were going to be love slaves...oh, lets not use just a modicum of common sense and be a bit subtle about our plans). 28 days later, this movie stinks like that fish out-of-water of the same duration.",2,0,2,12 July 2004
Avengers: Infinity War," Extremely inventive but derivative and totally predicatable until its finale
","What a colossal jumble of CGI / FX and complex character interactions. This film has everything and then some more from the kitchen sink. I was half-way expecting a cavalcade of Disney characters to come romping through this movie. Where were the Transformers? Where were the Jaegers from Pacific Rim? I feel cheated!! I had cinematic issues with some very derivative visuals / plot issues: The initial villian assisting Thanos looks an awful lot like Lord V from Harry Potter. The nasty animals trying to overrun Wakanda towards the end were directly borrowed from Lord of the Rings (the CGI looked identical, too). In the scene where the Avengers seem so close to overpowering Thanos, it was wildly over-telegraphed that Starlord was going to ruin it...and that cliched scene has been repeated over and over elsewhere. Yawn. But can we talk about the overarching plot here? So, why is Thanos a Malthusian? What's the evidence for an overpopulated Universe anyway? What's Thanos' beef? Consider: At least with Hitler and the Germans, they had a legitimate grievance (no matter how incredibly exaggerated into unconscionable and despicable action) regarding their treatment after WWI. We hear Thanos pontificating at various points to justify his quest to indiscriminately wipe out half the Universe...geez...that makes a lot of sense. It makes NO sense and he espouses no coherent viewpoint or justification, no matter how ill conceived, to back up his request. Well, is that any different than any insane villain? Perhaps not...but I thought the stones would at least give him some smarts...clearly not. So, I'm giving Infinity War eight stars based on the rapturous FX and outrageous character mashups but still find the plot unnecessarily weak on the essentials. BTW, I have no beef with the sad ending: It's about time reality struck. The Earth is on course to an overheated oblivion, too...we better get used to unhappy endings.",8,0,1,18 September 2018
Good Will Hunting," ...just to see Robin Williams
","How good can Robin Williams be in a serious role?  Just terrific, like Dead Poets Society.  This movie is worth seeing, if only for his great park-scene monologue.  Notice the interesting camera technique where the camera stays trained on Williams the entire time.  The camera wouldn't have moved even if ordered by Van Sant himself.  The screen play has an unbelievable premise; but so well written, who cares.",8,0,2,26 December 1999
A Quiet Place," A fun, if somewhat short ride, but certainly with major scary moments. (Contains Spoilers)
","An interesting premise but I'd really like to see the director's cut...so much background / explanatory information was likely left on the cutting room floor. I'm sure I'm repeating many other comments but I'll just add to the chorus. So, the creatures attack things that make sounds...but I'm guessing only certain kinds of sounds. But: If a tree branch falls in the woods does the creature go berserk and attack the branch? Nature makes tons of sounds in all frequency ranges! What the heck do these creatures eat? I guess I could (and should) level the same criticism at Alien/Aliens. Those Aliens got awfully big and I didn't see them eat anything...maybe they got into the cat food or something. If the creatures ate things that moved/made noise as it would be lots scarier...but we saw at least one scene where the creature merely killed its victim. It's not adding up. Then let's talk about guns. In America, like everyone's packing an AK if not multiples. Those creatures should be toast unless they have (as one post mentioned) protective armor. And since they seem to attack things making noise, seems someone would put 2+2 together and attack the creatures with high-frequency sound to see what happens (it's kind of like, duh). I bet a couple of dog whistles form PETCO would have stopped the creatures cold lots earlier in the movie (by disabling the creatures' protective mechanisms where could then be shot). It's these kind of plot holes that make Sci-Fi movies weak. And, btw, why the heck are you conceiving in the middle of a Creatures War? Like, gosh, put that thing away! Kinda dumb. That said, had Emily Blunt and John K run around with a lot less clothing on it would have been lots more entertaining (like, did you see his bod in that Benghazi movie?!?...dear lord). So, I do hope there's a much much more extended version...the film was only a crisp 90 min long.",8,3,4,22 April 2018
Call Me by Your Name," Ersatz romance in isolation
","Armie Hammer found himself grossly miscast as the diffident hunk and it doesn't work for me. There's less than zero chemistry between Oliver and Elio, despite a valiant (and Academy Award nominated) acting performance by Timothee Chalamet. The entire affair reeks of forced airs in a way never required in a Merchant/Ivory concoction. When Elio gets his explicitly telegraphed call at the end, it's a 100% groaner. Well, duh. But at least Timothee gets his Oscar try at the picture's end and I can't fault his acting...but Armie Hammer is out of his element...he can't convince me he has a gay bone in his body nor has he convinced me he has any feelings for Elio, sexual or emotional. It's an intellectual effort in non-onanistic pleasures. It's impossible for me to imagine Oliver wanting to do anything in that way with Elio given Armie's performance.",4,3,15,11 August 2018
Hero," Stunning visuals, fully realized story-telling, excellent acting
","A cinematic tour-de-force of the highest order. One ups Crouching Tiger in the visuals dept. Some think this is just Chinese propaganda, but I'm not here to judge the historical accuracy of what is clearly a martial arts fantasy film. Terrific acting all-around, even from the rather stiff Jet Li. Excellent fight scenes that don't bore in the least bit and can be watched over and over again. The care and attention brought to each of the fight scenes shows a master at work; the visuals used to show the skill levels of the various combatants exhibits equal mastery. I should note: Very little gore anywhere and no cursing. 我们的国家",10,0,1,27 January 2017
The Hurt Locker," Bombs can be boring
","Sad, bad; made me mad that I spent time watching this half-baked war flick. What's the problem? No real plot, nothing too interesting going on, hyper-realism that's both essentially boring and at the same time all too real...so it's more like a documentary highlighted by typical 'illuminating' contrived back stories. The entire movie felt very phony in its pretensions. That said, it wasn't preachy, at least not directly, and the acting was credible. I give lots of credit to the director for getting this movie made, but it's not much of a movie either. How could it have been improved?- by adding a political framework for the Iraqi point of view...are we just supposed to assume the usual contagion/animosity and all its stereotypical components? What about the sectarian strife between Muslim factions, etc? Is this merely a bomb squad movie that happens to be set some place in the Middle East?",5,5,10,24 March 2010
Children of Men," Children of incoherent plots and long camera takes
","I found the film to be an incoherent mess with a ludicrous plot, contrived action, and an unfulfilling ending. The film leaves out so much background material that the viewer is forced to pick it up in little stashed vignettes of article snippets, TV commercials, billboards, etc. Cute but not too effective and not convincing. Why has the world gone wacko? What's the issue with immigrants? Doesn't make any sense: In a world without children, you're going to need lots of cheap labor and, hey, that means immigrants! So, you have the wacko world subplot and the immigrant subplot and a black new world virgin Mary main plot. Interesting that little animals are still running around in the middle of this eco-disaster. So the rebels need to concoct a dangerous and elaborate ruse to kill off one of their own that could all too easily have killed the precious child just to later use the child as some kind of political rallying point?!? No one buys that illogic, except as an excuse for a very long camera take. And oh yeah, lets parade the baby past 100 armed soldiers who are just too dazzled to, lets say, grab all involved? Must have been the blood-spattered camera lens on the way into the building. And that ending...certainly summed up the movie for me: Lost at sea in a fog with a dead captain and a possible Bermuda Triangle-like ghost ship to the rescue.",2,20,34,15 October 2007
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Damages the franchise but entertains the generic masses
","As much as I'd like to gang up on SWTLJ and give it an appropriately damning '1' ratings, I can't do that. Sure, as many (the entire universe, et.al., ad nauseum) have tirelessly pointed out, this exercise in Disney dysfunction shows the force isn't with them nor the director: Inexplicable plot holes, an overload of deus-ex-machina rescues, characters acting wildly out of character, PC run amok. I found the acting by Daisy Ridley and Mark Hamill particularly on point (regardless of whether you agreed with the script) with Adam Driver not far behind. All acquitted themselves well. The special effects were far from amateur despite being used in the service of much silly, needless nonsense. The only actor that truly needed to be light-sabered was Domhnall Gleason. Who told him to overact so badly? Disney execs taking the dope left over by Carrie Fisher? And speaking of the near-dead and the truly dead, CF, R.I.P., was a big bore. Other waste of talent: Laura Dern. So many needless pointless side-stories. Gosh...maybe I should rethink my very generous rating .",6,4,15,16 February 2018
The Graduate," This is really *that* good; but not perfect (and so what)
","The Graduate is a 'must see' film for its fun and inventive cinematography, terrific acting, bold and cynical screenplay by Buck Henry, and certainly, its tour-de-force ending with a wan future upon wan smiles.  Other comments I've read complain about Katherine Ross's acting (I disagree), the overuse of Simon and Garfunkel music to move things along (maybe overdone), the unbelivability of the plot (in context, it has consistency), and that some scenes just go on for too long (perhaps, like the underwater diver pool scene).  But these are truly minor quibbles among an otherwise splendid quirky view of a spoiled, nihilistic, horny and obsessive rich kid in the California 60s.  The director Mike Nichols deserves every accolade -- I'm glad I finally had a chance to see this classic.",10,1,2,21 December 2003
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," One of the most inventive movies I've seen
","For three quarters of this movie, I kept asking myself 'How can the director sustain (and even build upon) this level of intensity and inventiveness?' The relationship intrigue unfolds like Ten Little Indians, except with what you think are just two characters. This movie will win the best original screenplay Oscar or we should never watch the Academy Awards ever again. I should add that Jim Carrey gives us another Truman Show performance, showing again that his real talent lies in more serious acting. Kate Winslet also makes a believable, nuanced foil in this twisted tete-a-tete. So, what happens in the last 1/4 of the movie? Well, there's a rather silly subplot that makes fun of the state of American workers (and of relationships in general) that takes away from the emotional momentum. The ending isn't entirely satisfying either...perhaps others who have watched have a better ending suggestion. Nevertheless, this movie's superb acting, dialog, and directing deserve special mention -- for 3/4 of its length, it is pure, unadulterated genius; and for the last 1/4, merely very fine.",10,1,3,28 December 2004
Avatar," Weak Plot, Derivative of what came before
","One hallmark of a poor movie is that the experience significantly degrades upon repeated viewings. For all the spectacular CGI, incredible scenery, and highly imaginative landscaping, the movie bores repeatedly with one movie cliché after another. Do I need to count what was stolen from The Matrix, Alien/Aliens, Dances with Wolves? Why rely on what has become known plot twists and conventions? How could Cameron recycle so many overused ideas in one movie? Sure the concept had much potential -- but with the focus on the FX, the more subtle plot details get washed out in predictability. Of course, the movie looks spectacular, especially in 3D on IMAX. The movie could have been so much more...",6,3,5,17 November 2010
La La Land," Wildly Overrated!!!
","Insipid, uninspiring and totally contrived. LaLa tries to be a love letter to LA but instead became rather dreary and predictable (and LA wasn't particularly shown to best advantage either). It was Moulin Rouge without the excitement, pizazz, or pacing (and that's not a particularly high bar). After the opening scene, which has been done elsewhere, it devolved into more cliché with mediocre dancing and singing. The saddest part for me is that I love romantic movies and I found no genuine chemistry between the main characters. Every note rang false, except for the energetic musical performances which contrasted sharply with the low energy elsewhere.",2,22,44,14 January 2017
The Matrix Reloaded," Mostly good, but with some noted weaknesses (no major spoilers)
","Saw this at 7pm on 5/14...and I don't want to give away any of the good details.Special Effects:  The special effects stun on so many levels and the car/bike chase scene is 100% riveting despite being less than emotionally engaging.  Many of the effects, such as the 'burly brawl' have little emotional content(esp. from Neo).  But my hats off to the creativity team on the effects...dazzling in a way that the Star Wars folks only dream about. Atmospherics, set, environmentals get A pluses.Acting:  A disappointment.  Morpheus' pedantic stolid monologs drag.  Neo goes from slightly ironic/hacker to wooden.  Only Trinity retains the Matrix's original sparkle.  Newer cast members add much life to this movie; too bad the Wachowski Brothers didn't allow more fluid acting by their mainstays.Plot:  Disconcerting.  The jump from the last film really needs to be fleshed out (which could have been done in many ways).  The petty bickering in Zion reminds me of the same in Star Wars (boring!).  Do we have to be reminded of bureaucracy's hold in every century?  Of course, once the chase ensues, the plot tightens up considerably...but we'll have to wait for Revolutions before revealing Agent Smith's full scheme (which was awkwardly handled in a couple of very short scenes).  Some intermittently bad script writing pops up (does the Oracle really need to say 'Bingo' again?...'I am the KeyMaker') along with very witty french dialog (but again, what's the context?).Misc:  The whole dance/orgy scene doesn't seem part of this movie...what's the point?  The music is great (I suspect many CD sales) and the scene highlights Carrie-Anne Moss' considerable acting abilities...but the scene lacks an appropriate contextual envelope.Overall:  Waiting for the Revolution.",7,0,0,15 May 2003
The Bridge on the River Kwai," A Greek Tragedy of South Eastern Pacific Proportions
","This movie almost moves at a French pace for nearly two hours...so I was wondering what was going through director David Lean's head:  All the nuances, the set ups, the little vignettes.  Beautiful, but slow.  Then the ending unfolds just as slowly, but psychically too fast: I was unprepared for the devastating ending which completely relies on all that came before it.  It completely enraptures one in the deepest tragic depths of civilization. <p>  I think about the scene from the movie Amadeus where Mozart hears the complaint that his opera is too long - too taxing - has too many notes; whereupon he asks which notes should be removed.  Of course, in a Mozart composition, no notes can be removed without diminishing the piece...and so, too, this film.",9,1,3,2 November 2003
Whiplash," I really disliked this movie
","I didn't 'enjoy' this movie though I don't fault the fine acting. Movies successfully pitch an alternate reality when internal consistencies makes the unbelievable believable. In the movie The Matrix, as in many Sci-Fi flicks, the director establishes environmental rules and all the characters operate within that framework. My objections to Whiplash focus on its extreme examples of behavior which are so extreme as to make them conspicuously inconsistent with the movie's time and place. Those extremes strain the credulity of nearly every key player. I couldn't take the movie seriously despite its fervent desire to make a case about over-the-top efforts / sacrifices and what some people think it takes to win. There was little / no back story to convince me any of the characters would either act like that, be allowed to act like that, or be the recipient of those same actions. It's caricature upon caricature. The movie's conclusion provided some semblance of redemptive believable cohesion but by then it really was too late and I found the whole setup very contrived.",2,16,33,28 March 2015
WALL·E," Creative Vision with Predictable Plot = Not Entirely Satisfying
","The stunning virtual world of Wall.E shows Pixar at the top of their creative graphic powers. Going over the beautiful CGI in my head, I'm still in awe of how the designers portrayed Wall.E's integrated world and their attention to detail will serve as a benchmark for years. That said, I'm less impressed by the simple and very predictable plot. Pixar/Disney married state-of-the-art visuals with a worn plot line from an early childhood fairy tale. I'm guessing the target audience for this movie is somewhere around 6th graders. Great summer family fare but not a great movie if you want something more substantial in terms of plot and character development.",7,52,106,3 July 2008
Arrival," What a silly movie!
","Why do so many of these so-called serious sci-fi movies have ridiculous setups, assumptions, and stereotypical responses to all-but-telegraphed scenes? I was really hoping Amy Adams would hold up a sign that read 'You: Our future calamari'. Let's start with the problems: 12 spaceships land all over earth and everyone's given a permanent work holiday...like life just suddenly stopped because 12 overpriced (hey, they're imported!!) fuzzy pickles situated themselves over future Whole Foods locations? Don't people still need food, hospitals, education, etc? Life can't simply stop waiting for Whole Foods to place a UPC on the spaceships. Next: Any alien ship that can suspend gravity and travel through space is going to have vastly superior technology to our own; plus the aliens wouldn't have landed if they were the least bit worried about the Earth's existing weaponry. Duh! You really think guns and bombs pose any worry? When did Neil Blomkamp become the director? So, we have a military know-nothing direct the language interaction program and call the shots? Not likely. As though there's anything to 'give away' to these aliens. Lastly, any species enabled with space faring ships won't have too many problems with basic communication...I know that's a grand assumption but, really. The whole approach to 'teaching' the aliens wasn't much more sophisticated than training my neighbor's one-eyed dog. Piloting spaceships across the void requires lots and lots of incredible technology AND communication (certainly between the spaceships). Lastly, this whole idea of time travel and time distortion as being a necessary component of 'teaching' humankind to interact is surely a stretch into the absurd (though this didn't stop many other movies from doing this, such as Interstellar). Oh, I should also mention that HP and Epson are running a special on squid ink this month in case any of the 12 ships are running low.",2,9,16,10 May 2017
Prometheus," Truly an unmitigated disappointment
","I had high hopes for Prometheus given the direction and production team's pedigrees. Alien in particular has stood the test of time by creating a completely realized and contextualized vision. That is, even when you set a film in a fictionalized environment, the film becomes real when the actors/set/action make sense within that environment...and it's in that requirement where Prometheus fails badly. The plot doesn't make internal sense unless, as Ripley put it in Aliens, 'IQs just dropped sharply' between now and 2089. It's not merely huge plot holes but annoying inconsistencies making you question how the characters could act/think that way...and many of these holes/questions arise through various forced homages to the original Alien movie. Sure, the film has stunning visuals and lots of excellent special effects (I saw the film in 3D IMAX) but they're wasted on a fractured plot. Not a single person clapped at the movie's end in a sold-out 7:30pm seating. Sadly, Prometheus' fire has been extinguished.",2,6,10,9 June 2012
Paths of Glory," A great movie, and perfect for a TV melodrama
","I can't get over the quality of the acting in this movie...so perfect. Kubrick must have beat the actors into their roles.  The only issue I have with this otherwise perfect war-as-depressing-bureaucratic-hell play is the all-too quick transition from the war zone to the trial scene.  If you blink too long, you'll wonder where the war went and how you wandered into one of the myriad law-as-drama TV shows.  Fortunately, the movie extends beyond its jurisprudence tableau into meatier fare.  Kirk Douglas looks and breathes his war weary part.  The final scene at the bar is another attempt by Kubrick to remind the audience what's really being lost in war (this major diversion theme is also repeated at 2001's end).  Here, as in 2001, it's a bit jarring and out of character with the rest of the movie.  I respect the director's choice but I'd have found a different way to have made the point.",10,0,1,9 February 2004
Casino Royale," Wildly Overrated; but not because of the v.fine Mr. Craig
","So, why only a 4 out of 10? Not because of Daniel Craig, who did a fine job of playing the cool, chiseled, dedicated, daring but always British Bond character (and having an outstanding physique doesn't hurt either). I have issues because the plot is beyond silly and contrived to the point of nonsensical. I'd need to completely spoil the 'plot' to list the absurdities, but a couple of oblique examples: The opening chase scene is part Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon in a laughable comic book over-the-top fashion. The plot twists don't make sense, especially the one involving the car chase scene toward the end and the subsequent actions which depend upon an outcome to that car chase which can't possibly be counted on in advance (and whose outcome is pivotal to the rest of the movie) (N.B. a Bond movie with car chase scenes? Not giving away much plot here!). So many clichéd plot lines involving drinks! The most boring card game ever filmed! So, this film is so much crap, except for the presence of Mr. Craig, who I hope will be treated to a much better screen play the next go 'round. A mostly wasted M, too, though one faults Judi Dench at their own peril (she was fine). Craig - 9 stars; Cheesy Movie - 0.",4,8,13,28 March 2007
Alien: Covenant," Not as bad as the many super negative reviews would have you believe
","I'm a big fan of the Alien franchise and have watched all the extras of the first four films and can repeat lines from the movies, particularly Aliens, etc. etc. I found Prometheus sorely disappointing in all possible ways...and after reading the many caustic reviews here on IMDb, I was about to write off A:C as well...but then I started to read the many 8~9 star reviews and changed my mindset <---which is key.A:C is, at heart, a horror film only loosely connected to the Alien franchise. It's a great piece of entertainment with terrific visuals and excellent special effects with plenty of action, a nasty, nasty villain and sufficient slimy henchmen. That said, if you're an Alien purest and demand logic and reason within the Alien Universe, this movie will be a HUGE disappointment. My goodness...what HUGE plot holes, physically impossible goings-on, key missing scenes (note Fox's mea culpa by releasing some prologue materials on Alien Day (4-26)) and far, far too much irrational behavior. The screen writers should be sent to LV-426. To enjoy this movie (to the extent it can be enjoyed) you must check your Alien-centric brain at the ticket kiosk. This is a horror film with a requisite amount of gore and action. Go with that attitude and sit back. Over-analysis will just make you angry.",7,22,42,25 May 2017
From Here to Eternity," Truly Excellent; Not Exactly the War Movie You Might Expect
","How others have rated this movie any less than 10-'stars' eludes me. Combine uniformly terrific acting from all involved, an excellent script, keen editing and directing with beautiful visuals, and you do have the 10-star movie that won so many awards. Every acting job is measured and believable, whether Lancaster's just-let-me-do-my-job introverted bullheadedness to Kerr's not-quite-the-Captain's-slut-wife to Sinatra's multi-dimensional kid-from-home-with-an-irrational-chip-on-his-shoulder to Clift's I'm-smarter'n'subtler-than-James-Dean-defiance to Reed's putting-on-airs-(up)country-girl-at-heart...it's all there. The war scenes are besides the point in this movie. You know there's a war just a'brewing. The real battlefield action happens between the characters in a way so much more important and real than a bunch of bombs dropping to blow up the latest Bruckheimer set. I'll admit the ending strains the movie's own internal logic, but that doesn't take away from its power. There's a war on and not every battlefield is equally as obvious.",10,26,42,24 October 2005
