Miracle," Team Sports Story
","The core story of 'Miracle' was Herb Brook's masterful deconstruction of the most legendary team in hockey history. The Soviets had dominated the sport for nearly two decades, but Brooks figured out a method to beat them, then had the guts and drive to put together a team that executed that method. And beat them.The film makes use of a number of period references, which help to explain why this game meant so much to so many in the US.   Some will find this jingoistic, but for most of us, it restores the memory of a time when teamwork did the impossible.Good story, great acting.  Nice to see Disney make real family entertainment again.",9,0,0,6 February 2004
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The Whole is Greater than the Sum of its Parts
","Having spent the last hour wading through dozens of reviews here, I'm frankly shocked at the poor quality of the reviews.  What matters is the RESULT and not the method.  Consider Shakespearean Acting:  it's wooden and contrived, but the sum of the dialogue and the acting just happen to work.
Set aside the special effects (which were more than good enough to suspend belief) and the plot(well, old George still has a few twists left in him after all, and there was a lot of material to squeeze in) which were on-par or better than the original trilogy.  Let's talk acting: Portman does a great job as royalty (stiff sense of duty and propriety), Chistensen does an outstanding job as a conflicted teenager (awkward with emotions, awkward in love, just plain awkward), and McGregor is spot on as the parent who doesn't know how to deal with a brat.  These are not the simple, innocent characters of the first trilogy; instead they all have conflicts that anyone can relate to.  Bingo -- that's the effect of both good storytelling and good acting. You might not like royals or bratty brooding teens, but don't blame the actors, they've done a good job portraying exactly that.So, all in all, is this a well-told story?  Yes.  Is it as good as the original trilogy?  Yes, and maybe more.",8,1,2,19 May 2002
