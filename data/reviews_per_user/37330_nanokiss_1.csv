The Ring," Damn good film
","As I haven't seen the Original film I can't compare it to that.This film was, However, Standing on it's own, very good.Naomi Watts did a fine job and was convincing, the Boy was good as well.Can't say what the movie was or whether it borrowed from another film, but it is not at all the sixth sense, and I don't know why people mention that movie. I assume it was the little boy.I was never scared in sixth sense, and the plot are nothing alike. The Twist in SS threw me, but I wasn't scared. This Movie DID scare me.It's a good film and worth the watch.",Null,0,0,27 October 2002
