First Man," Shaky cam, tight closesup, and an assaulting soundtrack
","I like movies.
I've seen movies.
Do you like movies.
I hated this one. Within the first 10 minutes.
Shaky cam moving all over the place. Usually to land close enough to the actors so you can count their skin pores. Gosling playing the same guy as he was in Blade Runner. It could have been titled 'Neil Armstrong - Blade Runner 1969'
Plus who knew that space has the same soundtrack as a low budget horror movie.",2,9,15,23 October 2018
Divergent," Not so bad, up until the 3rd act
","I was actually enjoying the film, but as I got closer to the ending the film got stupider and stupider. Classic good guys can aim, bad guys can't. Bad guys chasing you - why not stop and have an emotional moment. Worst was the last 10 minutes, when the logic floor dropped completely away.",5,0,1,18 May 2017
Dunkirk," An assault on my ears
","I went to see Dunkirk at the very end of it's movie theater run. Therefore I've heard how great it is, and was expecting to be impressed. Maybe I was expecting too much but I was underwhelmed. Now a day later I have found out that 'the Mole' is a dock for loading ships. Where the screen showed 'The mole, one week', 'The Sea, one Day', and 'The air, One Hour' it meant that there was going to be three different story lines occurring over one week, one day, and one hour, simultaneously. I didn't realize, while watching the film, that that was how the film was setup. (I was trying to figure out what a Mole was. It would have really helped if they said 'The Dock - during one week', etc. Plus the movie continuously cuts back and forth between these story lines. So you move forward in time, then back, then forward. Throw that all together and you can see why the movie is very confusing to some.I'm very familiar with the story of Dunkirk so the jumping around from time line to time line didn't throw me off that much. Except for when it was obviously night time in one story, and daytime in another. If I only had known that there were three movies going on at once. It would have made a lot more sense.My biggest problem with the movie was the sound track. Perhaps this only occurred in my theater (I doubt that), but it was oppressively loud. Not just the bang bang of guns firing, that's expected in movies these days, but here there is constant background droning. Not airplane noise - just really loud single note background noise. I took a tissue and stuffed it into my ears within 10 minutes of the start of the film, and I never felt that I could take the plugs out.The next biggest problem is the lack of a coherent story. I went with a friend who didn't know the Dunkirk story, and she had no idea what was going on. Over 300,000 soldiers were evacuated! You never would have known that through this movie. A third of the soldiers evacuated were French! You will have the opposite idea after the movie. Hundreds of small boats helped in the evacuation! The film shows about 12. The real WWII soldiers were well disciplined, and while there is always chaos in war, there was a chain of command in control! In this film there seems to be 3 people of high rank and everyone else is a private and on their own.There are some good points to the movie. Not enough to justify the current price of admission, but it wasn't a total waste.",4,9,14,28 September 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy," I was hoping for more
","It's a typical action, action, action movie. To me that means that the movie is just a collection of action sequences, without must thought given on how to get from one action sequence to the next.The good part of this movie is that the glue holding the action sequences together is fairly well done. They use a lot of humor, which is why some people have enjoyed the movie. And some of the cast are 'characters'. You know - interesting beings.The downside is that 20-30% of the action sequences are fluff. Totally unnecessary to the story. At one point I leaned back, and considered how I could while away the time until the current action sequence was over. IE it was boring. Zoom, zoom, bang, bang. Seen it.Another part that I disliked was all the time that went into setting up for the sequel. Leaving some loose ends is one thing, but this could have just as easily been called 'Part 1'.",4,6,15,28 September 2014
Wonder Woman," Can't believe that this is a sexist movie.
","I was surprised on how many typical male/female stereotypes were NOT broken. About the only box NOT checked was the heroine being blond. Up until the end it felt like a Chris Pine movie. Also amazed at how many cheap childish laughs the writer went for, and missed. How would you handle an island of Amazons meeting men. In this case the producer said 'channel your 8 year old inner child'.",5,4,12,8 September 2017
Godzilla," So very bad that it's good (as a comedy)
","Sure it's a really really bad movie. In the vain of just a bunch of action sequences strung together without much thought given to continuity or logic. But when the starting premise is that there exists a gigantic super powered monster that just popped into existence, then you have to give them some slack.The truth is that I loved it. I think the trick was to walk into the viewing expecting absolutely crazy stuff. Anything goes. Kind of like a dream. Just random firing of brain synapses. Nothing made sense, but it was fun watching what was thrown on the screen next. It was so absurd, you have to laugh.I don't think this gives away anything. But if you like to yell at the screen here's a line that I came up with half way through the movie. 'Look out Godzilla - they have machine guns'. Every time that you see someone with a machine gun - shout that. It'll have you rolling in the aisle.",7,0,1,28 September 2014
