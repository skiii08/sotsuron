The Longest Yard," Mean Machine rip off!!
","If you want to c the original script of this movie watch mean machine (2001). I just watched it and felt conned. (They even named the cons Football team in longest yard after the movie mean machine)The longest yard is exactly the same script as mean machine they just switched some of the elements to make it more slapstick hilarious.I give this movie a two only because it shifted some things and played all the clich√©'s. Racial jokes, Sexual jokes, Hollywood jokes.No wonder this movie is rated 7 plus by the younger crowd. I will say it again if you want to c an original well meant movie watch mean machine. Afterwards watch Longest Yard lets c how you feel..Nick W",2,1,2,17 April 2007
The Dark Knight," Do NOT believe the Hype
","To be honest I went to the cinema with great expectations since the movie scores so high. I felt like I wasn't informed correctly by IMDb. Especially some of the voters.Yes, the joker is portrayed nicely by Heath Ledger. Much darker and menacing than Jack. And yes, this movie is very close to the comicbook - real life conversion. Yet, during the movie I felt no oh or ah's in my soul. Nothing new that hasn't been seen before. The highlight of this movie is truly the interplay between Batman and the Joker. The rest was OK at best but unimaginative. (Did no one see the old trick of: 'Give it a quick sound and people might not notice that batmans bike doesn't move quick at all on screen.'??? Like in all the other movies and series?)This movie does not deserve a 9 nor a 10. It certainly isn't worth more than classics like the godfather. To be frank, I enjoyed batman begins more! That was a solid 8. Since you cant give 7,5 in IMDb I gave it a 7. At the end 1 person started clapping no one followed, in the jam packed cinema. The clapping died after 5 seconds.An honest opinion by a disappointing IMDb users.",7,5,10,30 July 2008
