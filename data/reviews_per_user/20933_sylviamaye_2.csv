The Incredible Hulk," Much better Marvel!
","In early April when I heard there was going to be ANOTHER Hulk movie my first thought was 'Why would they even bother again?' Okay, scratch that, my actual first thought was 'A sequel???' The first 2003 adaptation of the popular comic book flick was a sorry excuse for any Marvel film, being written off with such 'classics' as Daredevil, Ghostrider and Electra (even though I love Jen Gardner).I sat in the theater anticipating corny attempts at comedy, cringing at sappy romantic scenes and just plain covering my eyes as soon as the fake over sized CGI Hulk appeared on the screen. SURPRISINGLY I only did 1 of the 3. Though, there were sappy romantic scenes between Liv Tyler and Ed Norton I wasn't shoving my finger down my throat in mock sickness. The CGI was MUCH better and the storyline was definitely more believable than the father killing mother and turning into electrocution monster and son voluntarily transferring his Hulk genes through water to his dad thing. Ed Norton on the run from the government because of a science experiment GONE terribly wrong was much more believable, though, thoroughly predictable.The action scenes where exactly what a pyromaniac would be proud of--stock full of exploding cars, exploding helicopters, exploding tanks and...well pretty much anything that could explode did. Very sleek and easy to follow even with all the fast camera movement.The only things that still left me wondering 'what the heck happened to...?' was the scientist in the lab with a throbbing forehead and Liv Tyler's psychologist pseudo-boyfriend who was unsuspectingly okay with her just skipping town with the Hulk.Overall, 'Hulk smash!' and so did Marvel with this movie.",7,2,7,13 June 2008
The Proposal," I 'propose' you see this!
","I just got back from the theater with my mother (who laughed hysterically through out). Yeah, it's a romantic comedy and you're pretty sure you know how the movie is going to turn out so you may dismiss this without really giving it a chance. BIG MISTAKE! The movie is charming, hilarious and sweet. I was just waiting for Ryan and Sandra to kiss throughout. The chemistry was undeniable and the acting was wonderful. I could feel the sexual tension just oozing from the screen. And Ryan...WOW what a body that man has on him! Sandra is gorgeous and if you're a fan of hers you'll definitely want to see this one. LOVED IT!",10,17,37,19 June 2009
