The Monuments Men," Ideal movie for art buffs
","I don't know why this movie was so badly reviewed. I suppose there were those who saw the movie with the expectation of seeing something akin to the Tomb Raider, with bullets and gores flying all over the place?? The movie played out more like a documentary with splashes of drama here and there. I personally enjoyed it. I am one of those people who would prefer visiting art museums over a balmy beach. Therefore, it was a complete enjoyment to see all the masterpieces in the movie, and see how brave and valiant the characters were. The story began with a group of men who were the 'geeks' of the art world, and no one expected to die at all, because they were tasked to retrieve artifacts, not at the front line. But then the movie showed these men actually experienced what a soldier experienced: death, danger, fear, homesickness etc. I sympathized with the characters when they were down, and I felt their exhilaration/awe when they found the art pieces. I didn't know the monuments men existed until this movie, and to have a glimpse of what they did to save the pieces, and what were lost in the process, made this movie both an enjoyable drama and educational movie for me.",8,1,1,14 November 2014
