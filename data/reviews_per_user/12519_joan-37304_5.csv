It," Good: don't compare to the miniseries
",It was overall a good movie. The beginning was great and very shocking because of the fact that pennywise bites off the kid's arm. The dialogue between the two was great. Already loved the actor who played ritchie because of his part in stranger things so he couldnt do anything wrong. People's mistake is to compare the movie to the miniseries but that's not the way to look at the movie. You have to see it as an individual movie and based on that make an opinion. You cant simply unlike it because you think it sucks compared to the old miniseries.,7,1,1,8 September 2019
A Star Is Born," Nice movie
",It was a nice movie but i had really high expectations because of the hype that was going on for a time. So it wasn't as i had expected. Although it was good and really emotional.,7,0,4,3 January 2019
Joker," Mwah
",The story is beautiful. It showes that no one is born to be cruel but he was made evil by the society.. however the movie itself was like 2 hours and it didnt need that much time to show the story..The acting was good tho but i understand how people dont like this movie because its not a typical joker thing.,5,3,9,17 October 2019
It Chapter Two," Mwah: chapter 1 was better
","What i really liked about this movie was the fact that the ending was a real ending. The book is closed and there are no further questions. The story however of chapter 2 can be told in much less than 3 hours. The shocking parts were good but it wasnt really scary. I also didnt like the fact that pennywise hasnt talked as much as in the first movie. Chapter one was much better to my opinion. The shocking parts in chapter one for example were better, but also the way they portrayed pennywise.",6,6,9,8 September 2019
The Blind Side," Great movie
",This movie is so emotional.. i couldnt stop crying at some points.. Sandra Bullock is such a great actress. Her acting is very good in this movie. The fact that its a true story makes it more emotional..,8,3,4,29 August 2019
