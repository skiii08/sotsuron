Blade Runner 2049," I have to balance the incorrect scale
","Normally this film would get a 4 or 5. I am giving it a 1 because it is simply horrible and could be considered a 1 relative to the original blade runner. Others have given this outrageously good ratings, so i balance it out, but let us face reality, it is horrible. If this film could not be fast forwarded (with today's tech) it would be unbearable to watch. Further, there are times where there is a french horn fanfare (synthesized) and it suggests some grand cinematic sequence. Instead we just get blared with french horn (synthesized). I had to turn down the volume to not annoyed. This was futile, because when dialogue came in I had to raise volume and then was again kicked in the nuts when another french horn fanfare came for no particular reason. This is art gone bad. Very bad. They should have left blade runner well enough alone.",1,3,8,28 June 2018
Blade Runner 2049," just save your time and sanity. don't watch the film.
",Ever hear 'don't meat your heros' ? Don't watch this film. It will murder your inner child. There should be crimes against humanity for how badly they executed this sequel. If you want to preserve all that is good about the original; don't watch this.,1,2,8,28 June 2018
