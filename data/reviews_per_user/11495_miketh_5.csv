Requiem for a Dream," technically brilliant, otherwise mediocre
","**Warning: spoilers ahead**At basis, this is a pretty simple sort of drug film. It depicts the lives of four people, and how drugs are instrumental in their downfall. One loses sanity; another loses innocence and self-respect; another loses freedom; another loses an arm. The message is hardly subtle: drugs can mess you up. Well, duh.Three of these characters fall into destructive drug use in the ordinary, expected way: through escalating recreational use. More interesting is Ellen Burstyn's character, who instead naively allows herself to become dependent on amphetamines in order to lose weight for a television appearance -- an appearance we, as the audience, of course know will probably never happen, but which gives her otherwise meaningless life new hope.
It's a shame, really, that her character wasn't given primary focus in this film. For her, drugs are simply the incidental means to fulfilling some deeper desire rather than an end in themselves. She doesn't self-destruct because she wants to get high, but simply because she wants some reason to feel alive again. Much more could have been done with this idea if the movie hadn't been too busy showing the other characters' more routine kinds of addiction.This movie really doesn't stand out as a particularly poignant or interesting drug film, then -- certainly nothing to rival, say, Traffic. Where it does stand out is in technical excellence. The filmmaking is so perfect it is nearly sublime; if the movie fails in having a new or interesting message, it certainly succeeds in imparting its message with stylistic force. If for no other reason, Requiem deserves to be seen by anyone who loves a well-made film.",7,0,0,27 September 2001
Grease," sometimes funny, but mostly painful
","I should admit from the start that I'm not a huge fan of musicals. I was forced to watch this movie by my girlfriend, possibly in retaliation for my having made her watch three Jackie Chan movies in a row. So, take this review for whatever it's worth.Grease's status as a classic is, for me, quite perplexing. It's just a formulaic love story set in the 50s around a bunch of high school students (most of which, incidentally, appear to be at least in their mid 30s -- some, like Riz, look about 50). Although funny in parts -- the Frankie Avalon song, and the sequence where John Travolta tries to be a jock come to mind -- it largely just consists of stilted, cheesy dialogue and some of the lamest songs imaginable. ('Ramalamadingdong', anyone?) This movie might work if seen as an over-the-top satire, I guess, but that doesn't make it any less painful to watch.As a mode of vengeance for girlfriends, then, this movie rates a 10. Guys beware.",2,9,22,31 March 2001
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," not just another kung fu movie
","It's almost impossible to find good things to say about this movie that haven't already been said hundreds of times. But I'll say them anyhow: it is epic, exhilirating, engaging, and utterly beautiful.The major thing to understand about this film is that it is not really a kung fu movie in the traditional sense you'd expect. There's fight scenes, of course -- and they are beyond spectacular -- but for once they complement and enhance the storyline rather than replacing it. This is not another 'hero learns kung fu, conquers all foes' movie. It is a Chinese fairytale; a Taoist parable writ large. Expect no simplistic good vs. evil tale here. You'll spend too much time trying to figure out who the 'hero' is supposed to be.Just one further note: don't be put off by the fact that the movie is subtitled. Some people refuse to watch foreign-language films just because they feel that having to read the subtitles is too distracting; but not to worry, by the time ten minutes have passed you'll have forgotten that the actors are speaking Mandarin at all.",10,0,0,21 March 2001
The Evil Dead," woefully overrated
","Definition of a cult classic: a movie that never quite appealed to mainstream taste, but for some reason really appeals to a certain kind of person. With that in mind: Evil Dead is only going to be a cult classic for you if you're the certain kind of person that enjoys constant, gratuitous, vomit-inducing gore.Basic plotline: some teenagers go to stay in a creepy cabin in the woods. They discover an ancient Sumerian book -- the Necronomicon -- and unwittingly raise some evil spirits. And then everybody gets possessed and dies, with the sole exception of the hero. Wait, did I say 'dies'? I should have said 'gets torn limb from limb, gushes every conceivable kind of bodily fluid (and some inconceivable kinds), and just generally manages to perish in the most protracted and horrible way anyone could imagine'.Now, I have no basic objection to gore. In a good horror movie, the gore just highlights the terror, and adds a visually shocking element to it. But in this movie, there's really no suspense to go along with it; apart from a few false scares at the start, and some startling zombie attacks, it's really just constant, on-camera violence. I finished this movie feeling more ill than terrified.And humour? Well, unless you find something intrinsically hilarious about zombies chewing their own arms off, inflicting gaping wounds with pencils, and vomiting blood from neck-stumps, don't count on it. Even Bruce Campbell isn't any fun in this movie; he's basically here only to be terrorized, look put-upon, and get drenched with blood. This isn't the hilarious, manic Ash that makes the later movies worthwhile.",3,4,12,21 March 2001
Mission: Impossible II," misconceived sequel
","The cool thing about Mission Impossible II is that it's a John Woo movie. The dumb thing about it is that it's *just another* John Woo movie. The first MI movie was great because of a complex plot, combined with great action scenes. This movie is nothing but action scenes. Change the setting and the actors, and half the scenes in this movie could be substituted with ones from Face/Off (and vice versa) and you'd never be able to tell the difference.Fans of John Woo will find a lot to like here. It's got all his trademarks -- slow motion shots of people walking in the wind, fight scenes where everyone spins around a lot, and so forth. For that matter, fans of action movies in general will like it too. But if you like this movie, it's not *because* you liked the first one. If you watch it, watch it for brainless action. If you go in expecting a engaging or challenging plot, get ready to be as disappointed as I was.",5,0,1,21 March 2001
