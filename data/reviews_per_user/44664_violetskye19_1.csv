Hereditary," I Rarely Write Reviews ...
","But then I rarely see a movie this damn good ! I'm not going to write any spoilers, or say what it's about, I think if someone had told me the premise behind this beforehand I would of said 'what a crap, corny idea for a movie and it would suck' and if I had said that (which I didn't) I'd take it all back, every single word. I don't think I've watched a movie in years that has had me looking at EVERY little thing on screen, as SO much pops up when you least expect it, that your looking into the shadows and shapes and markings for the next little bit to come along and slam you with at truly 'wtf' moment, and there are plenty of them. If the movie seems to start off slow, don't worry it doesn't take long to warm up and take you on a damn good 2hr ride. There were just a couple of downers - 1 I'll call the swimming/floating bit, once you've seen the movie you'll know what I mean - didn't like it, at all and 2 unfortunately was the ending - there's not always a need to tie everything up with a pretty bow and spell things out just in case people didn't quite get it - sometimes a fall is best left just where it is - you'll understand that after seeing the movie too. Still a farking Stupendous horror that should keep everyone looking over their shoulder for a little while and I'm definitely keeping the night light on tonight !",10,1,3,24 October 2018
