The Blair Witch Project," nothing to fear but fear itself...
","Wow. The one hyped film of the summer that actually holds up.I have a feeling that since its doing big numbers there's going to be a backlash -but for what it is...an inventive low budget horror film, its remarkable. What I liked best was that it seemed to be mostly about fear itself -the things fear does to people - rather than what was actually taking place. You're never really sure anyway. The ending was so damn creepy that I'm afraid I'm having nightmares tonite. Highly recommended.",8,1,2,2 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," a mixed bag all around
","OK. Perhaps I'm chiming in too early as I've only seen it once. But here's how I felt -up and down the whole time. For every great thing I had a reservation.so bad news first...It felt like a rough draft...The first half hour or so was largely throw away. Why does Jar Jar Binks have more screen time than OBI WAN KENOBI? Why did we spend so much time in Jar Jar's world when it only had a slight connection to the events following it in the film--He was the embodiment of the main problem in this film -comedy. Seems Lucas doesn't understand that comic relief implies that there's something really dramatic that you need relief from -a chance to catch your breath. But the drama was missing so it seemed like one long (and painfully unfunny) comedy revue. Most of TPM's depth came from things we brought to it based on the other movies, our knowledge of their collective future. It doesn't have much depth standing on its own. That made me sad. And little Jake Lloyd has definitely taken the crown away from Mark Hammill when it comes to worst performance in a star wars film. 'Yipee I get to be a Jedi' made me ill.It was also kind of sad that all the heroism in the film was sort of accidental. Didn't leave much room for character arcs or the triumph of will. Everything seemed to happen by accident. A strange story decision considering all the talk about the force and destiny and finally it must be said -The Matrix had much better special effects :(Whew. Sorry. Now onto the good things:Qui Gonn Jinn and Darth Maul were excellent additions to the Star Wars Universe and the most interesting characters in the film. The cameos from Yoda and Jabba were great. Queen Amidala shows promise -though I hoped for more from the extraordinary Portman. The production design and costumes were as inventive and elaborate as they promised to be. The film got much better as it went along. The lightsaber duel/climax was breathtaking and as good as anything in the original trilogy. During a few moments late in the film I felt that old Star Wars magic.Let's hope Episode 2 takes off from there and leaves the comedy behind.",7,0,1,30 May 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Maximum raunch, shock, and laughs.
",Ohmylordy was that film raunchy. My face hurts from laughing though. Not for the faint of heart or morally uptight. A regularly inspired satire of our cultures downward spiralling blame games and diversionary morality. Wonderfully on target. Funnier and more shocking than anything else this summer.But I still can't believe parents in the theater bringing  truckloads of kids. What are they thinking exactly?,8,0,0,2 August 1999
Velvet Goldmine," Haynes does it again!
","I have to say that after 'Safe' and now this... Todd Haynes is really on a roll. A total original.There's been a lot of 'not for everyone' talk and I must say shouldn't we be GRATEFUL for that? This and 'Safe' and 'Poison' (haven't seen 'Superstar' but would love to I could only find it!) they are all infuriating in some ways to some people but I, for one, am so relieved that there's no pandering to the audience. I like being challenged and seeing things in new ways. His non-linear and visual approach to storytelling worked for me.Loved Toni Collette's performance (very Liza-esque in the early 70's scenes which was a nice touch) I heard some griping about her accent on the way out of the theater but I thought the wavering accent was part of the point of her character. American poseur with faux accent in early scenes -gradually gets more American as she retreats from the scene but because of the repeated jumping and flip flopping about in time -it could appear to some that she couldn't maintain the accent. I think I'm in love with Jonathan Rhys-Meyers. He floored me. My eyes were doing that heart thing his did onscreen.My only gripe about the movie is that it seemed to have about 6 endings. The opening Oscar Wilde sequence was genius but it sort of spun loose at the end.",9,2,3,12 November 1998
Moulin Rouge!," Spectacular! Spectacular!
","Baz tops himself again. The film is sure to be reviled since it's so vital, cinematic, and groundbreaking. It will take some critics and some audience members years to catch up. Baz Luhrmann and his fearlessly committed team -particular honors go to the costumes, production design, cinematography- have fashioned a film that's unlike any other (high praise!) and that deserves all the scattered raves it will also be reaping. And then of course there's the music. It's a dazzling and sometimes left field approach to a song score and it works so well... Total highlights? Jim Broadbent's hilarious 'Like A Virgin', the 'Come What May' Bollywood finale, and 'the Tango Roxanne.' I hope that moviegoers will open up their minds and hearts to this. We desperately need films that challenge us visually and aurally. We need films that arrive in messy confusing 'I-don't-know-quite-what-to-make-of-this' glory. The same old same old will kill the art form. I saw this movie last night and I'm ready to go again this morning. To quote the plug/plea of the sales pitch within the film 'SPECTACULAR! SPECTACULAR!'",10,0,1,19 May 2001
Eyes Wide Shut," legs wide shut
","For a movie about sexual obsessions and sexual jealousy and a supposedly complex marital relationship -there was little sex in evidence. Tom & Nicole may have felt they were doing something scandalous and historical but the naughtiest thing they do is say the F word a lot. This feels like the sort of film that will be hailed as a masterpiece solely on its reverent pacing and the reputation of its director...not based on what it actually is.The cinematography and lighting were gorgeous and Nicole Kidman had some interesting moments near the beginning but everything felt so forced, so deliberate...its as if everyone in every scene was too aware the entire time of the importance of the project so anything idiosyncratic or spontaneous has been stamped out. It felt depressingly lifeless and studied.The big set piece (the orgy sequence everyone talks about) is creepy to a degree but hardly as shocking as it wants to be. A tame film considering the wild rumors that abounded before it actually premiered.",5,0,0,18 July 1999
Bring It On," Surprisingly fresh and well played
",Wow! I normally don't go for the teen comedy genre but I thought this was completely fresh. Any time your felt you were coming up on a cliche the film threw you somewhere else. Definitely elevating this was Kirsten Dunst who is turning into quite the actress. This is very different than her work in Virgin Suicides but equally appropriate and suited to the film. Plus I loved seeing Eliza Dushku in something other than Buffy (where of course she excels as Faith.)Very fun invigorating comedy stuff and WAY above the typical light teen comedy.,8,0,0,27 August 2000
Blow," Look Out! It's Going to...Blow!
","Sometimes a film is such a spectacular heap of mediocrity...that it transcends that plainness and becomes a BAD film. Where to start? Was it the monotony of the screenplay? The excessively dumb narration to underscore EVERY scene? The painful clunky dialogue? The non existent structure? The performances had highlights but none of them went anywhere. The director didn't think to shape anything...Easily one of the least edited, least directed, least exciting films I've ever seen. I don't bore easily at movies and I was fighting off sleep at every moment. And sometimes it seemed to me that the actors onscreen were as bored as I was.  Johnny Depp is normally such a fine actor and even he was just phoning it in. What a waste of celluloid. What a waste of several good actors. A waste of my time.",3,0,1,26 April 2001
