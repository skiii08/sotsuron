The Incredible Hulk," Not too shabby
","I watched this last night and it is a decent enough film. You can tell that this was cut down a fair chunk to make it what it was: and in doing so I think they may have ruined what could of been a top notch movie ( there are some significant time leaps between shots). Still not a bad film, they could have done a bit more with Blonsky's character and included a bit more of the hulk hopping between buildings like an ungraceful Spiderman. That was great to see. One downfall is that there is no hulk pummel. But there is a hulk smash: which is what made the movie for me personally. Also the babe at the bottling plant is a lot hotter than Liv Tyler!",Null,2,3,21 September 2008
