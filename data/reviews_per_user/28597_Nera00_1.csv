Requiem for a Dream," That's a movie!!!!!!!
","I'm thrilled with this movie!There's something in this story that makes you think about life, it's sadness, happiness, meaning. It's a dramatic,but in a good way.This film has a fantastic music that fits perfectly.The scenes are made so good and very real.I watched it in a one breath.Watching this movie made me think abut old, lonely people about aging process and about youth, how can you easily destroy it. It's important to be needed to need someone.I would recommend this movie to people who like dramas and weird movies. It's a sad but excellent movie.Enjoy!",10,0,1,23 July 2012
