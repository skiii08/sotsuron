The Equalizer," This must be a joke !
","I love Danzel Washington and his movies, but his character 'Robert' must be a superhero. A one man army. The people behind the movie should have known this pretty well.Seen a couple of Sunny Deol movies from Bollywood where any human is equally capable.Towards the end it goes off the roof. Robert lands in Moscow, king the kingpin and all his associates in their den. Just like that.Shitty IMDb rating of 7sth made me watch this one. I rate this a 3 at most.Nothing special. Nothing.That is all I want to write about the movie but I am required to write at least 10 lines about a movie that I liked nothing about. Common. That's unfair. Let me post this review.",3,1,5,1 January 2015
