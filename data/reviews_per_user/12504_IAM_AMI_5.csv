Green Book," Mind Blowing
","This film was breathtaking! I couldn't breath when it was sad, when it was ugly, when it was violent, when it was touching when it was funny! What a great film! What a sad but great story! 2 amazing men who changed their individual worlds and then the ugly world if only by watching this film!",8,0,1,3 May 2019
Gladiator," All time Classic !!!!
","One of those all time classics that reshaped the genre when it was all but dead. Crowe is splendid in the lead role and commands the screen in a role he was born to play. Ridley Scott returns to form after a few films fail to find critical or financial success. The film swept the box office and awards so, the film plays out like an artistic big budget passion of love. This is one film I haven't tired from after all these years and have just recently experienced the extended cut, I think studios should allow 3 hour films as a standard practice. I cannot fault what I might even call my favourite film of all time.",9,1,1,3 May 2019
The Godfather," Perfect !!!!!
","Fabulous movie. The cinematography and music were perfect. The score of this movie is one of the most memorable ever. If you were to hear it you could identify it right away. The cinematography was what actually really drove this movie. The Godfather seems to have this mystique to it, it gives you the feeling you are watching something truly remarkable.",9,0,1,5 May 2019
