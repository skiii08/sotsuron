Casablanca," There is a reason it is a classic
","I saw Casablanca in my senior film class in high school and I almost at a instant I fell in love with it. This movie is fantastic and needs to be watched by everyone. The acting is one of kind and still holds up today the sheer notion of this movie being outdated is crazy. This film also has great dialog and scenes, you could cut out any bit of this movie and it would standalone very well.The soundtrack is one of a kind it is a huge driving force for the movie and it really helps it out. All in all this is one of the best movies of all time and if you have not seen it yet go and watch it now. Its a one of a kind movie with a one of a kind cast.",10,1,2,1 September 2014
