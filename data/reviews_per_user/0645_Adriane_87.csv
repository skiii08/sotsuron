The Rock," Remains to this day the best action movie ever made
","The best action movie I have ever seen, and nothing will ever top it. My absolute favorite actor in the world is Nicholas Cage (no one better, ever) and Ed Harris, Sean Connery are two of the best actors of all time. I was in San Francisco this past summer, and took a tour around The Rock and it is an incredible place filled with memories, terror and fear. Leaves you chilled after you leave there learning about all that has happened there. The movie had action, drama, a bit of comedy and thrills. Ed Harris gives a blisteringly real performance as the Former Lieutenant Col. who holds San Fran by the button ready to fire atomic rockets. Nicolas and Sean worked wonderful together and were great to watch. I don't know anybody who did not like this movie. Thanks to Nicolas, Sean, and Ed for making the best action movie I have ever seen, and to the director Michael Bay for not ruining this movie with unnecessary cheesiness and boring action. This movie was anything but boring! Even my mother loved it-and she is 47! (She loves Sean and Nick too) If you have not seen this movie, my gosh run fast to the video store! Rock on!",Null,1,1,1 March 1999
The Blair Witch Project," Don't believe what everyone says....
","This is not the 'scariest movie of the year.' I didn't even cringe once. A worthy story, but these kids fighting gets on your nerves. It was a worthy effort, but doesn't pull it off in the end. It goes on a bit too long, and not much keeps your attention. 2/4 stars.",4,0,1,22 August 1999
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," The BEST film of 2004 (better than vol 1)
","*spoilers warning* I originally saw Vol 1 on DVD, loved it and saw vol 2 on opening night. I also received vol 2 on DVD the day it came out and I stand firmly by the belief of what Tarantino said. 'vol 1 has the questions, vol 2 has the answers.' This is so true. After viewing 1, your head is dizzy. But volume 2 fills all those gaping holes like The Bride's name, the location of Bill, the fate of her daughter, and the other 2 she needs to get rid of and exactly how did that Massacre at Two Pines happen? I will not say what the best part, but look for the subtle references to what lies in store for The Bride and what kind of man Bill is. The characters are well-developed, the screenplay moves at a good pace, and the ending is awesome. I just wish it was longer. One last thing to add: David Carradine is worthy of an Oscar as Best Supporting Actor and Uma as Best Actress.",Null,2,4,19 August 2004
Antz," Loved it
","I saw this movie in the theater with my younger sisters and all three of us loved it. It has plenty of laughs, action and a hint of romance. The ants that the celebrities voice for look and act like them. Woody Allen is small, Jennifer Lopez has the curves,  Stallone has muscles, and Christopher Walken has the same face as in real life. Enjoyable for adults as well as kids.",Null,0,0,15 May 2000
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Force is strong with this one
","I have now seen TPM twice, and I have to say that the second time was the best. This is one that definitely needs to be seen more than once. Great score by John Williams, as usual, and the performances were pretty good, despite what everyone has said. Neeson and McGregor are way cool, Portman is stern, but good, and Jake Lloyd is pretty cool in his abilities for his age. I especially liked Jar Jar Binks, even though some people found him annoying, I really liked him because he was lovable and funny, like R2-D2 and C-3PO. Truly, you do have to be a fan to see these as well, I own the trilogy and have watched each one this weekend to follow up again on the stories. I do feel that this movie was worth the wait, and we don't care what the critics think anyway. Us fans will see it no matter what, and I would love to see it again, but my advice is to see it more than once. The pod races is the coolest scene! So, everyone who did not like it, do yourself a favor and go see it again, you will probably have a different opinion! George has once again created a film that everyone is sure to talk about for many years to come.",Null,0,3,24 May 1999
The Sound of Music," How do you not love this movie!?
","One of my favorite musicals of all time next to 'Grease' and 'Cabaret'. Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer are wonderful together! The scenery and cinematography are breathtaking as well, set against Austria. I dare you to not sing along with Andrews! Should be watched by every family! Still delights me today!",Null,0,5,19 September 1999
Ali," Missed punch from the very beginning
","If you are going to make a biography about someone's life, have some emotion in it. And this film needed an editor too! So many details that did not need to be there. Go see Lord of the Rings instead. Hopefully, this movie will not be well awarded",Null,1,1,2 January 2002
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Loved it, wonderful story and fantastic effects!!!!
","This story is recommended for the whole family. Laughs, action and romance. Kathleen Turner is wonderful as Jessica and Roger is hilarious. Roger is framed for murder and Hoskins must clear his name. Great cameos by cartoon characters, especially my favorite Betty Boop. Delivers great effects and laughs. Recommended to everyone...!",Null,1,1,7 December 1998
Chinatown," A milestone in cinema history.
","A wonderful movie from start to finish. I love you Jack! How come none of his movies ever suck? One of the greatest actors ever. Faye Dunaway is wonderful as well. Polanski makes a funny cameo as the knife-carrying, nose slashing gangster. This and Rosemary's Baby are two of the best films from the 60's and 70's. A great movie to watch for drama, light comedy, and thrills. The acting, direction and story make for a film on my top 20 list.",Null,0,2,21 November 1999
Erin Brockovich," Impressive film with a stellar perfromance by Roberts
","From my other comments about Roberts' films, my opinion of her fluctuates from film to film of hers. Notting Hill and Runaway Bride were great, and no one forgets her performance in the classic 'Pretty Woman'. Yes, she made some stinkers, and she has now bounced back. I was very impressed with her performance in this film, and with Finney's as well. Yes, it's true that her outfits do stand out, but she looks good in them, and carries herself nicely. Warning: She does have an acid tongue though! She says whatever comes into her mind, and is very ambituous in her job, she literally pours herself into this case. This film was much more convincing that 'A Civil Action' in the way that it was not too bogged down with unnecessary emotion and characters and the story was more believable. The direction and plot follow very smoothly, and you feel sympathy for Erin. She has no education, 3 kids, has been divorced twice, and is $17,000 in debt. However, she gets involoved in this case, and makes a difference in her life and the lives around her. This is Julia's best performance in the last few years and she should feel proud of herself for playing a real-life woman with just the right emotion, character and believeableness. Congrats Julia, but it is still plenty enjoyable if you are not a Julia fan.  Good performances by everyone else in the film as well, including Aaron Eckhart and Albert Finney. Another note: I wish I could pull off the outfits like she could!",Null,0,1,15 October 2000
Meet the Parents," I haven't laughed this hard since American Pie
","I didn't think that I would like this movie, but I was wrong. A boring summer at the theater gave this movie some freshness and great laughs. Ben Stiller and Robert DeNiro have some great scenes together, and for those of you who didn't think that DeNiro is funny, just watch Analyze This. A guaranteed laugh every 3-4 minutes.",Null,0,0,29 October 2000
Se7en," Freak me out, the most chilling thriller next to 'Silence'
","Silence of the Lambs is one of the best serial killer movies in my book, and this one ranks second. Chills me every time I see it. The ending is the most shocking thing you will ever see. I saw this in the theatre twice and bought it when it came to video. Movies rarely touch me and have me thinking for a few days after but this one had me trembling coming out of the theatre. Recommended for the non-squeamish and if you have not seen it, my god run to the video store...",Null,0,0,20 November 1998
The Big Lebowski," Original, witty and as good if not better than Fargo
","Seeing this movie for the first time, I was entertained and delighted by it. Fargo was wonderful, and I have recommended it to everyone, but this one was not as confusing as Fargo with all the sub-plots. John Turturro was funny as Jesus the bowler, and Steve Buscemi (who is wonderful and eccentrically cute), as well as Julianne Moore who gives a bohemian performance. Jeff Bridges and John Goodman steal the show though. As the Dude, he is a typical laid back LA slacker. Walter (John Goodman) is always yelling and recalling Vietnam and Dude always tells him to shut up!! It is a funny, witty, original comedy that is another show-stealer by the wonderful Cohen Brothers. I have not seen one film of theirs that I did not enjoy. This one compares with 'Raising Arizona'. Rent it today and have a ball!!",Null,0,0,16 February 1999
As Good as It Gets," I love you Jack!!
","Jack , you are one of the best actors ever! This just adds to the already long list of wonderful movies that you have made. Helen and Greg are wonderful as well. Jack is so funny in this movie. Another Oscar-winning performance. The dog is hilarious as well. A fine romantic comedy, with some dramatic moments as well. Fine performances by all, with Cuba Gooding Jr. having some funny moments. Strong script by James Brooks, great direction as well. Rent for great story, and heartwarming ending.",Null,0,0,28 November 1999
Citizen Kane," 'You're awful funny aren't you?'
","The exact words to sum up Orson's take on the supposed life of WR Hearst. Deny it all you want, it was about him. While it's not my favorite film, it ranks up there will one of the best films of all time. Best scenes are : News on the March intro, Susan yelling at Charlie after her opera debut and the beginning mortal words ever captured on film: 'Rosebud.' While these are not all the best scenes, the film is filled with them. Why didn't this film win more Oscars? Welles should have won best actor and best director. Watch it once, then again to understand it better....10/10",Null,0,1,26 September 2003
Shakespeare in Love," Good, but not worthy of Best Picture
","This movie was good, but it was not wonderful. I personally loved Life is Beautiful, and felt that that was more deserving of more awards than this one. Cate Blanchett was more deserving of the Oscar too, her role was a harder one to pull off. Paltrow did not do or say anything spectacular in this one, not anything Oscar-worthy mind you. All she did was have sex with Shakespeare. But the costumes are incredible and Judi Dench is wonderful in her 8 minutes on-screen. Geoffrey Rush is also funny as well. Sorry, guys the Oscars were too abundant for this film, and some should have gone to others.",6,1,2,5 April 1999
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," For a myriad of reasons, it was the best movie of the summer
","Anyone who has ever been to Disneyland has rode Pirates of the Caribbean. And, it's often everyone's favorite ride, I know it's mine. However, I was excited to watch because it has the 2 hottest guys in Hollywood: Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom, and the story appealed to everyone. It has everything: action, plenty of laughs, great cast and characters, and a good plot. Hopefully, if Disney continues to make movies of its attractions, they won't fall short on characters and plot holes. Bring the whole family for this one. Watch for the similarities from the ride: the dog holding the keys in the jail, and the wonderful song, 'Yo ho ho, the life of a pirate for me.' Dead men tell no tales.",Null,0,0,2 December 2003
The English Patient," Absolutely beautiful! I cried and cried
","I am the only person in my family who loved this movie and I thought it was just beautiful. Juliette Binoche was wonderful, she was my favorite character in the movie, and she was very well deserving of her Oscar. Ralph Fiennes was very good as well. Beautiful cinematography and setting. This is a girl movie, guys including my father and boyfriend found it boring, but I loved it. For the romantic buffs and those who like a good drama. Watch it with the girlfriends though!!",Null,0,1,8 February 1999
Elizabeth," Cate should have won the Oscar for her incredible performance as Queen Elizabeth...
","An incredible movie from start to finish. Cate Blanchett has become one of my favorite new actresses. I want to see more of her work. She gives an Oscar-winning performance as Virgin Queen, with an outstanding supporting cast. I have seen Shakespeare In Love, and Gwyneth had nothing on Cate, once again an Oscar overlooked. Fortunately, Cate has received many awards for this performance. Geoffrey Rush is wonderful as well, he too is very powerful. This is a movie and a performance that I will remember for a long time. Congratulations, Cate for an outstanding role and great work!!!",9,0,0,28 April 1999
Finding Nemo," This is now the 2nd best animated film I have ever seen
","This movie stands in line next to my personal favorite, Lilo and Stitch. But from Pixar, the best is obviously Monsters Inc and both Toy Story's. What drives this film and makes it delightful is not only its animation (which you want in every aspect of your field of vision), but its heartfelt story that kids and adults can relate to. Marlin as the constantly funny Albert Brooks does nothing less than what we know from him, and the short term memory Dory by the wonderful Ellen Degeneres never failed to entertain me and my family. But what parents can take from the film is to believe in your kids, don't constantly watch over them, let them breathe and have fun!!! Maybe great white shark Bruce (as the film's most intimidating character, and the bully all kids recognize) sums up the best words of the film, 'fish are friends, not food.' 10/10",Null,0,1,8 October 2003
The Mummy," Fun movie..Brendan Fraser is a hunk!
","How could you not like this movie? Action, laughs, romance, and Brendan Fraser! 4 travelers accidentally awaken The Mummy, who has been buried alive for 3,000 years for loving a woman he shouldn't have. He is just a little mad. Seeing revenge and wanting to bring back the woman he loved, adventure begins! Flesh-eating bugs, sands rising, powers unleashed! No one can stop him until he gets what he wants. Brendan Fraser is funny as O'Connell, and Rachel Weisz is a beautiful young lady. John Hannah from Four Weddings and a Funeral is amusing as her brother Jonathan. Watch for the fun, adventure, laughs and special effects. Recommended for everyone!",Null,0,0,28 September 1999
Chicken Run," Wonderful fun no matter how old you are.
","This is one of the best movies of 2000. Original, visually stunning, and hysterical. I love Wallace and Gromit, and Chicken Run lives up to its predescessor. Sure, I love to eat chicken, and the way we treat chickens is bad, but it's just like the message in Toy Story: treat your toys good. The writers develop the characters properly, and we get to know all of the chickens. Babs was my favorite, and Mel Gibson is funny as Rocky the Rhode Island Red Rooster. A fun movie for the whole family.",Null,0,0,13 January 2001
Sleepy Hollow," I wish I could give it a 15!
","My rating is off the charts because this is such a visually spectacular film. Burton is one of our most eccentric directors, and his films never fail to entertain me. 'Edward Scissorhands' is my favorite film of his. No director is a dark and gothic without borderlining on Satan worship. Johnny Depp makes a great comeback, and Christina Ricci is one of my favorite actresses. People have told me that I look like her. A fun and entertaining film , but not for the squeamish. 'There is a bit of witch in you, because you have bewitched me.'",Null,0,0,6 December 1999
Romeo + Juliet," I loved it-and not because of Leonardo!
","A lot of people did not like this update, but it was not for everyone. You either loved it or hated it. I loved it for the fact that the dialogue was exactly the same as the play, and the performers delivered it perfectly. Danes and Dicaprio are perfect together! They deserve credit for memorizing those lines. The movie moves fast and never stalls. Of course we all know how it ends, but we still watch anyway. This one deserves credit and recognition, and the best part about it is the romance-not Leo.",Null,1,2,17 August 1999
Bridget Jones's Diary," I know exactly why I loved this movie so much
","I first saw this movie when it came out with my father of all people, but he was in town and he actually wanted to see a chick flick. However, that is not the kind of film this is. Zellweger absolutely shines in this hilarious comedy, with Grant and Firth competing for her attention at different times. Oddly similar to Pride and Predjudice (also starring Firth, sometimes you feel if Zellweger is Elizabeth Bennett. I also read the book, and the movie is a very good adaptation and true to its predecessor. Enjoyable for anyone who feels that they can relate to Bridget. No one but Zellweger could have done this role with the honesty and comedic talent she displays. 4/4.",Null,0,0,14 October 2001
10 Things I Hate About You," 'You're concentrating awfully hard considering this is gym class'
","A much better film than most of the 'teen films' this year. She's All That and I Know What you Did Last Summer sucked, but this one was worth the time. Believable characters, fun story line, funny characters, and witty dialogue. I especially enjoyed the girls father. Plenty to laugh at and enjoy!",9,0,0,13 October 1999
Fargo," You either loved or hated this one:I loved it!!!
","A great movie that only the Coen brothers could have pulled off. First-rate performances all around, although Frances wasn't in the movie enough to be Best Actress, maybe Best Supporting Actress. I have never disliked any Coen brothers movie, 'Big Lebowski' and 'Raising Arizona' are two of their other greats. This movie was like Pulp Fiction: you either liked it or hated it. I loved it and to all those who didn't: you didn't give it a chance, and I dare everybody to not quote lines from this movie: Did I like it? 'Oh you betcha, YA!'",Null,0,0,19 April 1999
Notting Hill," You can't go wrong with this movie
","Let me set the record straight: I have never been a big fan of Julia Roberts, but due to the fact that I have seen most of her movies (and some of them are enjoyable), my opinion of her really fluctuates. This and Runaway Bride were very good. I have always been a fan of Hugh Grant, and I love English comedy, so this movie had a lot of the right ingredients. And the English scenery is wonderful as well. A well- rounded romantic comedy (his friends are hilarious, especially Spike) with some touching moments, especially from Roberts at the end. The ending is adorable! A worthy rent, a great cast and plenty of funny and touching parts.",Null,0,0,25 January 2000
"Good Morning, Vietnam"," Robin Williams plays an over-the top disc jockey who gives hope and laughter to soldiers in Vietnam
","A memorable film. One of Robin Williams best roles, next to 'Good Will Hunting' and 'Dead Poets Society'. And one of his funniest roles too. Playing Adrian, he shows laughter through pain at one of America's most tragic times. A wonderful film that should be watched by all of Williams' fans.",Null,5,11,19 September 1999
American Pie," Best movie of the summer!!
","God, I love this movie! Seen it 3 times and I still laughed hysterically! It was original, hilarious, and heartwarming. All the guys in the movie are cute, especially Oz and Finch (who in a way resembles a young Nicolas Cage). Eugene Levy is also hilarious as Jim's dad, and the movie has it's heartwarming moments as well. You can't go wrong here- laughs, romance, and a story with real characters. I am owning this one on video! If you don't laugh, check your pulse!",10,1,2,1 August 1999
Grease," The best musical of all time!
","No other musical beats this one! The cast is perfect, and it is very funny as well. Travolta is still a babe. Watching this movie, you will be singing the songs with everybody. Fun cast, great songs and appeal still make this a great film today. Grease is still the word!",Null,44,72,4 October 1999
Cast Away," Good, but not as amazing as Forrest Gump.
","First of all, Tom Hanks is an incredible actor. He exemplifies every movie that he is in, and he has always been one of my favorite actors. Forrest Gump is one of mine & my sisters favorite movies. I expected this to be as good, but I was a little disappointed. Helen Hunt is completely useless in this movie, and her and Hanks have no chemistry at all, so you don't care about their relationship. But Hanks does great on his own. The island scenes are wonderful, and he develops a funny and touching friendship with Wilson, a volleyball. All in all, it is good, but I don't think it will take home a lot of Oscars. Zemeckis and Hanks are great, but before and after the island come up dry. 8/10.",Null,0,0,30 December 2000
Lilo & Stitch," My new favorite Disney movie
","I'm 24, and I love this movie! It puts a smile on my face every time I watch it. Also, the Elvis songs on the soundtrack are great. Kids are sure to become Elvis fans now! Disney has now provided us with a fresh, funny and original idea and it comes at a good time since this was not like other Disney films. No evil queens or stepmothers, and a main character with a heart of gold who only wants a friend. Stitch will win your heart. Also, Ving Rhames' character was modeled exactly after Marcellus Wallace in Pulp Fiction. He provided a fun spoof of himself. 'Thus far you can been adrift in the sheltered harbor of my patience.' A delight for the whole family and adults of all ages. 10/10",Null,0,0,2 March 2003
Armageddon," Boring and I expected much better...
","I loved the Rock and I can't believe that the Bruckheimers would make this movie. I was bored, and found Bruce Willis's performance lacking emotion and originality. I cannot stand Liv Tyler and was not impressed with usually wonderful Ben Affleck's performance. This and Godzilla were two of the dumbest and un-original movies this year. Would rather spend my time watching The Rock-which was wonderful. Watch The Rock instead, you will be much more interested in Nicolas Cage and Connery.",Null,0,1,13 November 1998
American Beauty," One of the most perfect movies ever
","This is my second comment for this film, and I have to comment about it again. I am very happy with the films 8 nominations. Deserving in every way. It is the 2nd best movie I have seen in 5 years. Every single aspect is amazing- acting, directing, characters, plot, cinematography, setting. Kevin Spacey is BRILLIANT in his role, as is Annette Bening. The Oscar should go to Kevin. Anyone who thinks that this movie is overrated or crap in any way, needs to rethink their choice in movies. I am very much looking forward to the awards and how they will turn out. Thank you to everyone who made this beautiful film- you will all be rewarded. If you have not seen it yet, RUN to the theater! You will leave with a different outlook and perspective on life. I have not stopped recommending this movie since it came out , and I won't stop. I would give it a 15 if I could.",Null,0,0,18 February 2000
American Beauty," Could very well be one of the best of 99
","What a film! Everyone in it is perfect, especially Spacey and Bening who should be nominated for their roles. The movie should get many awards as well. An intricate story that actually has a plot. Bored with being told what to do, Spacey decides to change his ways to win over his daughter's cheerleader friend, Angela who he lusts after the minute he sees her (the fantasy scenes are erotic, funny and sensual), he starts smoking pot, blackmails his boss, and working out. Bening, bored with him as well, begins to explore her other side as well. She is annoyingly perfect, and she reminds you of Martha Stewart. She plays the part perfectly. Other stories include the new next door neighbor's and their voyeuristic son Ricky, who videotapes everything like a bag blowing in the breeze and a dead bird. Because the movie is sensually erotic and provoking at the same time, that's what makes it so good to watch. Oscars all around in my opinion. Start the fall off with good movies like this! Highly recommended-4 stars.",Null,0,0,17 October 1999
Edward Scissorhands," Love it, love it, love it, love it
","Warning-*possible spoiler ahead*Tim Burton's best movie (they are all wonderful). This movie teaches us that it's ok to be different, and that we  should accept our differences instead of fighting them. Tim Burton is great a creating stories about underrated people. I never miss a Burton film, especially if Johnny Depp or Winona Ryder are in one of them. Burton always brings out the eccentricity in Depp (for example, see Ed Wood or Sleepy Hollow, both great films, also Beetlejuice with Ryder). Edward Scissorhands is such a beautiful film in every way. The snow fall at the beginning, the developing relationship between Ryder and Depp, and the character development (you really know who you like and who you don't by the time this film is over). One of my favorite scenes is when Depp and Alan Arkin (who is very funny in his scenes) go to the basement and Arkin is pouring scotch and Edward asks what it is and Arkin says 'Lemonade.' Highly recommended viewing for the whole family. 10/10",Null,0,0,10 July 2000
Edward Scissorhands," I LOOOOOOVE this movie!!!
",One of the best of the 90's. Nobody but Johnny Depp could have pulled off this performance. A man with scissors for hands?? We need an actor as eccentric and beautiful as the character. Tim Burton directs with charisma and simplicity as usual. Winona Ryder pulls in yet another brilliant performance as Km. A beautiful movie. Recommended for everyone!,Null,0,0,13 December 1999
Being John Malkovich," I can't put this description into words, but I enjoyed it very much
","A truly original piece of cinema. Never before have I seen a movie like this. The cast is wonderful, and John Malkovich has never been funnier. The scenes where he goes into his own head are hilarious. Spike Jonze deserves our credit for directing his first feature film and getting an Oscar nomination for Best Director. He's following in the footsteps of his famous father-in-law, the great Francis Ford Coppola. Great film!",Null,1,2,2 May 2000
Face_Off," Anyone who says this movie is dumb and boring...take your face off!!!

The Exorcist," Insanely brilliant that it sends shivers down your spine.
","** Possible spoilers** Hands down, this is one of the TRULY scariest movies ever made. I wish that half the so-called scary movies made today scared the hell out of you like this one did to me. I wanted to sleep with the light on! I have not yet read the book, but I plan on it. The entire cast is perfect, especially Linda Blair as young and innocent Regan (not for long!!). This should be #1 on everyone's Top 5 scariest movies of all time. 10/10. P.S. I never get shocked or offended, but that crucifix scene is insane!",Null,1,3,24 November 2000
Gone with the Wind," A great movie for us girls...
","Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn!' This is perhaps one of the best movies ever made. But, it is only for us girls. My boyfriend would be so bored. Vivian Leigh plays the most memorable character I have ever seen. Scarlett O'Hara is the most complex woman I have ever seen on screen. Director Fleming shows us the world through Leigh's eyes, and we are taken through fire, war, death, broken promises, betrayal, and lost love. Tara is a mystic place, filled with everything you could go through living in a small town. Gable and Leigh give the best performances, Gable should have gotten the Oscar for his performance as stubborn Rhett. Sometimes you want to hug Scarlett, other times you want to slap her! DeHaviland also gives a wondeful performance as Melanie, the innocent and lighthearted cousin of Scarlett. So girls, treat yourself and watch this wonderful move..believe me you won't regret it..",Null,0,1,7 July 1999
Man on the Moon," The Oscar race is between Jim Carrey and Kevin Spacey
","Five minutes into this film, you forget that you are watching Jim and it feels that Andy is really there. After being shunned for The Truman Show, Jim deserves a nomination for this. I have never seen an actor deliver such a real performance as this one. He actually looks like him! Thank ya vedy much, Jim.",Null,0,0,29 December 1999
The Princess Bride," The classic fairy tale
","One of the most enjoyable fantasies ever. No one else could have played the parts better than this cast especially Robin Wright as Buttercup and Cary Elwes as Wesley who look wonderful together. Watch for Billy Crystal and Carol Kane in a funny cameo appearance as Magic Max and his wife. 'Have fun stormin' the castle!'. Enjoyable for the whole family.

The Pianist," The sheer horror and brilliance of this film cannot be described in words
","I will admit that when Adrien Brody won the Oscar last weekend, his speech was so moving and genuine that I was immediately drawn to wanting to see the film, and I'm glad I waited until after the awards to see it for the first time. The depth of his performance is absolute madness. Everything that happens to him in this film shows the genuine triumph of the human spirit. His love for playing the piano is what keeps him alive when everything around him is destroyed, and his music was the only thing that remained constant in his life. The fact that this film was directed by Roman Polanski is the best part. A fellow Holocaust survivor, what Polanski survived came across every frame of this film. Simply put, no one else could have directed the film. However, the film is one word: DISTURBING. It moves at a good pace, never drags and in one scene, (no spoilers) Brody truly realizes exactly how close he has been to death. Not hesitating, this is simply one of the best movies I have ever seen.",Null,0,1,29 March 2003
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Leave it alone..it wasn't bad

Good Will Hunting," Um, hello, to everyone who did not like this movie..what's not to like about it??
","Matt Damon and Ben Affleck deserve our utmost sincerity and appreciation for writing a brilliant script. Robin Williams gives one of the best performances of his career! Matt & Ben were well deserving of their Oscar for the script , as was Robin for his supporting award. This movie should have gotten more Oscars than it did. Watching Will and how hard his life has been was a real eye opener for me, I realized how much he and I had in common. Matt Damon playing this role allowed me to view my own life and allow me to forgive some people. So, thank you Matt for your inspirational role. Minnie Driver was brilliant as well in her role, she was way better than Kim Basinger , and she should have gotten the Oscar. Bravo to everyone involved in this film! Absolutely brilliant in every way...",Null,3,7,16 September 1999
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Even more superior to Fellowship
","First of all, I would like to say that Peter Jackson is the only director who could have done these films. It is overly apparent that he knows the books. He has portrayed Tolkien's vision in a way that Tolkien himself could never have imagined. When I saw Fellowship last year, I knew nothing about the stories, and after viewing it, I immediately bought all the books and was instantly hooked. I thought 'It can only get better from here', and I was right. The Two Towers never falters, and its action sequences are unlike anything you have ever seen. Unlike Fellowship, this is Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli's film. Frodo and Sam provide the journey to the story, of trying to get rid of the now-heavy and prominent force over Frodo's life. The effects are what made the movie fantastic, they look so real! Although the film is 3 hours, it felt like 20 minutes. I felt as though Jackson had provided seats right there in New Zealand for us, and we watched from the sides like spectators at a football game. Now the hardest part: waiting one more year for the final film. The best movie of the year. *****/5 stars",Null,0,0,19 December 2002
Slap Shot," Hilarious movie
","I love hockey, so this movie hits all the right notes. Hanson's are hilarious as the fighting players, and Newman is funny as well as the long-suffering coach. The opening scenes are too funny as well. Watch for hilarious fun, and if you are a hockey fan like me it is even better!",Null,0,4,27 May 1999
Dumb and Dumber," Farrelly Brothers Do It Again!!
","If I had a list for the ten funniest movies ever made, this is on it. Jim Carrey in top form as usual, with a funny performance by Jeff Daniels. Don't rent if you have no sense of humor or basically no pulse... because you have to laugh at this movie! Best scene is Jeff Daniels on the toilet.",9,0,2,8 March 1999
Caddyshack," 'If you watch this movie, I bet you get a free bowl of soup'
","If I ever make a list of the 10 funniest movies, ever, this is number #2. I have seen it probably over 50 times, and I still laugh my a** off every time. Rodney Dangerfield is a comic genius and Chevy Chase rules. 'I was born to love you, I was born to lick you face'. Recommended for golf lovers, comedy lovers, and it is the perfect movie to cheer you up after you have had a bad day. I guarantee that you will laugh hysterically!",Null,1,2,28 November 1999
Big Fish," A big fish of a film
","A long time Tim Burton fan, I was anxious to see this film for the story of a father who tells tales that you can't quite figure out if they are unbelievably ridiculous or true in a sense but exaggerated beyond belief. Whatever it is, it works in the way that we find out what we need to find out. Ewan Macgregor looks as though he stepped out of a 50's Crest Toothpaste commercial; Albert Finney who is always wise beyond his years. Yes there are elements of the ridiculous- Karl the giant, the Japanese twins and Calloway the circus manager (who is something else entirely by night). But it's okay-because in the end, it develops as a beautiful father/son story.",Null,0,0,26 April 2004
The Insider," Everybody needs to stop smoking right now.
","I have 3 favorite actors of all time. Al Pacino is one of the three. To watch him act is pure genius. With all due respect to Mr. Pacino, who is a wonderful actor and person, this movie belongs to Russell Crowe. This was a difficult part and character, and he played it beautifully. The whole time, he looked like he was going to have a nervous breakdown. The tremendous pressure that he was put under. 'Do I tell?' 'Do I keep my mouth shut?'. It is a double edged sword. He deserves an Oscar nomination. Al & Michael Mann always pull off a great production when they work together (just watch Heat, you'll agree with me). And to everyone who did not like this: do yourself a favor and don't see movies with involved character stories, because it is impossible to not think of this movie as one of the best of the year (next to American Beauty). If you dont like movies with controversy and character studies, this is not for you. My mother and I loved it and we are recommending it to all our friends. Al and Russell are wonderful and the story & direction are nothing short of brilliant. Finally, a movie with a plot! 4 stars.",Null,0,0,13 November 1999
"Girl, Interrupted"," I read the book before I saw the movie
","Susanna Kaysen really did spend 18 months at a mental hospital but it was not called Claymoore. In her book, she describes all the girls, and her friendships with them, confrontations with others. I have been a fan of Angelina Jolie since Gia, which she was brilliant in, and have seen most of her films. She was deserving of her Oscar, although she is evil at times, by the end of the movie you end up hating her. Always a fan of Winona, I have seen all her films and still think that she is deserving of an Oscar. She should have been nominated for something in this movie, but a lot of times the supporting actors are the best. Every other girl in the film is great. As for the movie, I liked it, but I didn't think it was wonderful. But it is GOOD. American Beauty was my favorite film of 99, but this one is up there with the performances, not the actual story. Remember it for the acting, especially the scenes with just Jolie and Ryder. My memorable scene will be when Whoopi Goldberg is watching Winona shave her legs because she has to use a razor and well... you figure out why she has to be watched.",Null,0,0,11 June 2000
Men in Black," Funny and hilariously silly flick..
","I loved this movie when I first saw it in the theater two years ago. I loved it so much that I bought it. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones make a great on-screen duo, and the jokes are funny as well. I would like to see these two together more. Watch for the story, effects and jokes.

","I took my nine year old sisters to see it this weekend, and it was great. The old toys are back (same voices as before) with some new ones as well. Don't miss Kelsey Grammer as the voice of  The Prospector. They're out to save Woody this time, from greedy Al, who wants to complete his collection of Woody and the gang.

There's Something About Mary," Funny Funny Movie!!
","Did I say that it was funny!? Shockingly dirty too, but that is what makes it funny!! Cameron was wonderful as usual, as well as Ben Stiller. Matt Dillon gave a good performance as the sleazy private investigator too. See it with someone you love or a bunch of friends!! One of the funniest of 98!!",Null,0,0,8 February 1999
Life Is Beautiful," An exquisite film in every way....
","The absolute best movie that I have seen this year. Begnini directs and acts in a funny, touching drama about the most horrible experience of the century. He is well-deserving of his Oscars, as were the other awards that it has received. I also enjoyed his love for his wife, as she too is a beautiful and exquisite actress. I loved the entire film from beginning to end. The ending makes you cry-but I won't spoil it for everyone that has not seen it! Go see this movie and thank you Roberto for making us laugh and cry at your beautiful film.",10,1,2,28 March 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," A complete waste of time...
","This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Tom and Nicole are totally wasted here, and this is a sad ending to a great director's career. The story goes nowhere and there is no feeling toward the characters. The previews make it out to be a sexy film, but it is far from that. I spent two and a half hours of my life watching this film that I will never get back. Trust me, go see 'American Pie' or 'Austin Powers'.",Null,0,1,18 July 1999
Some Like It Hot," The Best movie ever made! My all time favorite...
","This is my favorite movie of all time, and I am a movie buff, so this movie is really good!! Jack Lemmon and Joe E. Brown are fantastic and funny. He and Tony Curtis give award winning performances as does Marilyn Monroe. Rent it today, never mind that it is 40 years old. It still entertains me when I watch it. Run to the video store!!!",Null,1,3,8 February 1999
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," High energy British fun
","British movies are some of my favorites, and I am going to London this summer for the first time. While it has been compared to Pulp Fiction, I thought that it moved faster and had more laughs than Pulp. Many people may not understand what they are saying at times, watch it again to get it fully. Everytime I have watched it, I have laughed numerously! Lots of fun. 'It's a deal , it's a steal, it's the deal of the f*****ing century!'.",Null,0,0,28 May 2001
Titanic," What can I say about the most popular movie of all time? There has never been anything like it!
","Since I have commented on over 100 movies, my collection may not seem complete without a comment for the grandest, biggest, most expensive and highest grossing film of all time. You either loved it or hated it, it was one of the films like 'Pulp Fiction' or 'Fargo' (which I loved both, by the way), and I know why everyone talked about it for months on end. It is a grand film. It isn't my favorite movie of all time (Some Like It Hot takes that title), but it is worthy of a place on my video shelf. Kate Winslet gives a powerful performance as Rose, and Leo DiCaprio is very good as well. I'm not one of those girls who swoons over him, but some of his movies have been enjoyable including 'Gilbert Grape' and 'Romeo and Juliet'. Kate was wonderful in 'Heavenly Creatures' and 'Sense and Sensibility' and she has become of of my favorite actresses because her roles are given from the heart, she puts her best effort into her acting. I must confess that I bought the movie the day that it came on video and have only watched it a few other times. While I do enjoy the film very much, I am glad that the hype has died down. The effects and sets are Oscar-winning and for a reason, you will never see a boat bigger than this one! A great job by all, although many may view it as a chick flick (hey, my mother loved it too!). If you can spare three hours, check it out or watch it again. 'I'll never let go, I promise'.",Null,1,3,25 October 1999
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," One word: Awesome!
","Everything that a family film should be. I'm 23, and I took my 11 year old sisters (who had read the book) and we loved it. I now want to read all 4 books. I'm very impressed with Daniel Radcliffe! I hope we see more great work from him. I felt that this film was worth the hype (for once a film gets the attention that it deserves) and I would love to see it again. A very clever story with some wonderful visual effects. Take the whole family!",Null,0,0,22 November 2001
It's a Wonderful Life," Just a wonderful movie
","Best of any year, this movie should be on everyone's top 20 list. It is on mine, next to 'Godfather' and 'Some Like it Hot', two of my all time favorites. Jimmy Stewart is wonderful as George, if only we all had the opportunity to see what life would be like without each one of us. Good at any time of year, not just Christmas. Donna Reed is wonderful as his wife Mary, for putting up with him. You will laugh, cry and look at your own world. It is a wonderful life!!!",9,1,3,1 January 1999
Rosemary's Baby," Most horror movies wish they could be this creepy!
","Tired from all the recent slashers, this classic is a breath of fresh air. Although there is not much blood and gore, is is suspenseful and that is what keeps you glued to the screen. As far as I am concerned, what makes a great horror movie is the absence of blood and gore. Take for example The Exorcist- a great movie filled with suspense and insanity, yet it also didn't have any unnecessary graphicness. Mia Farrow portrays Rosemary with just the right amount of fragility and Ruth Gordon is goofy & insane as oversolicitous neighbor Minnie. Polanski's direction leaves the image of the 'baby' open to the imagination, and the characters develop when you don't expect it. This should be on everyone's top ten horror movies of all time list.",Null,0,1,10 November 2000
A Hard Day's Night," Fun movie, with the 4 greatest guys ever..
","I am a big Beatles fan, and so is my mother (she saw them perform in her hometown of Chicago when she was 18) and she still loves them today. I will buy a Beatles Cd, she will listen to it, she will buy one and I will listen and we trade off our collections. The Beatles have given me and my mother fun conversation and a good time. I am only 21, so I was not alive when they were famous of course, or even when they broke up. Although I'm sure that they have all had their differences, I hope that George, Paul and Ringo are still good friends today. George's stabbing on December 31st was a shocking and cruel act to a wonderful musician, who is still adored by millions of fans. They all are adored. My mother's favorite was George, and she was shocked and saddened by the incident. My personal favorite is Ringo, because he is a wonderful drummer, and he is so different from the other guys (in a good way of course). His voice is so awesome! This movie perfectly captures a day in the life of the Beatles, with a great soundtrack and some memorable lines. Paul's grandfather is hilarious! 'He's a villian, a real mixer.' This movie should be a part of any Beatles fan collection, as it is a part of mine. Thank you to the 4 greatest guys ever, you'll always be with me and my mother in our hearts and memories.",Null,6,10,19 January 2000
The Green Mile," Powerful in every way that it can be..
","Possible Spoiler:***   I am 22, and I see lots of movies on a weekly and monthly basis. I had no interest in seeing it in the theater, but then a couple of my friends saw it and told me how incredible it was, so I waited for video. Boy, I wish I had followed my friends advice and seen it in the theater. I rented it and was completely blown away by it. I haven't cried at a movie in over 4 years, and at the end of this I was crying like a 2 year old with a scraped knee! Michael Clarke Duncan should have won the Academy Award for his performance, he was astonishing as John Coffey. Tom Hanks (brilliant as usual) makes the most of his role as head guard on The Mile. The entire cast is perfect, and Darabont's direction is flawless. Even though it is over 3 hours long, it only seems like an hour, that's when you know you have a great movie. As soon as it is available for purchase I will be owning it and I have recommended it to all my friends and family. After I was done watching it, my mother watched and was also blown away by it, we were both crying. There are many powerful moments in this film.  One of the most powerful scenes though, is when Coffey 'shows' Hanks what he knows.",Null,0,0,18 August 2000
Blow," It didn't blow...
","Sure, the movie is not 100% original, but are half the movies out there today? My trips to the movies are getting less and less these days, but I dragged my boyfriend to this one because I love Johnny Depp and I love the drug-movie subgenre. The story was interesting, not overly indulged in sex and nudity, and not as much language as Goodfellas or Boogie Nights (two movies that I loved, by the way), and Depp played it perfectly, as did Paul Reubens, who stole every scene that he was in. One of the only flaws of the film was the casting of Penelope Cruz, who is a very beautiful woman, but she was miscast in this role. I would have liked to have seen someone like Salma Hayek or possibly Jennifer Lopez next to Depp, but her role was supporting anyway (she doesn't appear until halfway into the film). The music was great as well, pure 70's rock. If you are going to see the film, see it purely for the story and the great rock n'roll! 8/10.",Null,0,0,9 April 2001

","No movie will ever compare to this, and should never try. The first time I saw it, I was 12 and it gave me nightmare. Then I read the book (nightmares again). Then at age 16, I decided to watch it again. I studied it, and was fascinated by it. (it is still plenty scary though!) I am a psychology major, hoping to specialize in criminal psychology. This is essential viewing for fans of thrillers and twisted plots. Foster and Hopkins are very deserving of their Oscars, I especially loved Foster's performance. Hopkins will get into you head and under your skin. Perfect in every way, and it is my second favorite movie of all time.",Null,0,0,18 December 1999

","This and 'Seven' remain the only two movies that still chill me after watching them. This one is brillant in every way: acting, direction, story and suspense. This movie deserved every Oscar that it got. Foster and Hopkins performances remain the best of their careers. having read the book, I am equally satisfied with the movie. You will remember it for a long time. Hannibal Lecter remains one of the creepiest characters I have ever seen on screen. An exquisite movie in every way. Highly recommended with 4 stars.",Null,0,0,17 August 1999

Al Pacino (who I absolutely love) and Cameron Diaz should be ashamed of this movie. Oliver Stone needs a writer and an editor for his films, they are all way too long and have no point. Everybody screaming at everyone in this movie. Don't waste your time and money, go see 'The Hurricane' or 'Girl Interrupted'.",Null,0,1,28 January 2000
Trainspotting," One of the best independent movies ever
","The clear message in this movie: Choose life over drugs! If this movie doesn't stop you from doing drugs, nothing will. This should be viewed by anyone using drugs, or getting off of drugs. Ewan McGregor gives the performance of his career as Renton, the junkie who tries, but still loves being on drugs. Everyone in the cast is perfect, and the soundtrack is hip and fun. Best scene is the condom scene. Warning: This movie is not for everyone and is graphic and distorted at times, so should be viewed with caution if you are easily offended (I am not, but this movie did shock me). Highly worthwhile if you enjoy character studies and independent films.",Null,0,1,6 February 2000
The Sixth Sense," One of the best mystery/suspense movies I have seen in a long time..
","This movie is amazing! Haley Osmont is an incredible little actor as Cole, the boy who can see, hear and talk to dead people. Bruce Willis is also very good in one of his best performances in a long time as Malcom Crowe, the child psychologist who feels the need to help Cole overcome his problem. The plot thickens at a time when you don't expect it and the ending will leave you breathless! Olivia Williams and Toni Collette are very good in their roles as well. I highly recommend this movie as entertaining, well written and directed, and well acted. More suspenseful and scarier than 'Blair Witch'. Run to the theater NOW!!",9,0,0,29 August 1999

Would they do it again? Say whatever you want about these or any other trilogy for that matter, but this murders every other one (especially Star Wars-Lucas doesn't hold a candle to Tolkien).

Jim Carrey should win a lot of awards for this one, but the academy loves Tom Hanks so he will probably get everything. But, Jim you have got my vote!

I had my mother watch it and we both agree on one thing: take away the action, and when you are left with the dialogue only, it is a sad movie. Are we just a spreading virus?

Sharon Stone is powerful as ex-hooker Ginger McKenna, her performance has many different levels. Joe Pesci is the villian we all love to hate, and DeNiro delivers yet another fantastic performance. Scorsese tells this one on many different levels-running the casino, behind the casino doors, who really gets your money, and what NOT to do when you visit the casino.

The Godfather," My second favorite movie of all time.
","I am half Italian, so I must comment on this film. It is a part of my family, it is our heritage. Almost everyone in my family owns the trilogy. They are some of the most brilliant films ever made. Francis Ford Coppola is nothing short of the most brilliant director of the century. Everyone in the cast is perfect, especially Marlon and Al. Pacino is his usual genius self. The unfolding of these characters is a story of its own. The 4 Corleone brothers are all very different. Sonny, (wonderful performance by James Caan), the hot-headed, quick tempered man, Fredo, weak and powerless, goes to Vegas to set up business, only to be brought down my Michael. Michael, the most sensible, if not accepting of his family's business, he is the most likely successor of the title. Finally, Robert Duvall (a wonderful performance as well) , as Tom the lawyer and trusted counselor to the Corleone's. Watching everyone on screen and the story of the family is nothing short if genius. Watch only if you have three hours for each movie to spare, and if you like complicated character stories. It's an offer you can't refuse.",10,1,5,10 December 1999
