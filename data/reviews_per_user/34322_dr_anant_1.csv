Requiem for a Dream," Real, Scary
","It was very difficult to get a DVD of this movie in India n after a lot of searching, managed to buy one.In medical college n also other colleges, u see people on cannabis with a few capricious beings trying cocaine n ketamine n the like..they go on with their life, u do your thing. Advice isn't well appreciated n anyway, cynicism is a quality fast imbibed in college. After seeing this movie, which is like a 1000 Floydian hammers smashing through your head, u wonder. Everyone of those idiots in college could have ended up this way. Much as the end of this movie was designed to represent the worst case scenario, its one hell of a fright. The smiles n quirkiness quickly turning to tragedy - scary and effective. Jared leto's mum in the movie - Deserved an Oscar if there ever was one.",10,1,2,1 January 2007
