Raiders of the Lost Ark," Good enough
","It was great for its time. An enjoyable watch today and a good laugh because it reminds you how things used to be and where we've come from there. All in all, this film is a piece of history.",7,1,1,27 August 2019
Hereditary," Disappointing
","Not much to say here. Utterly disappointing film. The plot was ridiculous and uninteresting, the pacing was slow and for the most part nothing was happening in the movie, the characters were not representative of real life people and above all this movie WASN'T SCARY! Seriously, how can ANYBODY get scared watching this movie? I don't think that it's possible. There was no suspense, no tension and when they tried to create some, it just fell flat. I spent most of my time laughing at the ridiculousness of the script and characters. 
The only thing that was mildly entertaining was the creepy child but alas, she was killed off early. It's not worth your time.",4,0,2,27 August 2018
Bird Box," Lots of potential. Lazy writing.
","I think the title says it all. This movie kept to my seat and I was eager to watch what would happen next, until the ending came. The movie made absolutely no effort to give us even the most rudimentary of answers. What are the entities? Where do they come from? HOW do they work and why do they attack? What's their endgame?! What happens to the couple that runs away? What happens to the old man locked out on his garage?I'm giving it 5/10 because technically speaking the movie was solid and the premise was great. But it had great hype for nothing and in the end didn't meet expectations.",5,1,2,6 March 2019
The Hills Have Eyes," Instant cult!
","This movie was not scary nor shocking. The jumpscares were underwhelming, tension was virtually nonexistent and the acting left a lot to be desired. There's not much character development EXCEPT for our boy Doug, who was, in the end, the saving grace of this film.I mean the film was utterly boring because the characters were stupid enough to root for the mutants aaaand the villains were predictable, not scary and kinda funny. BUT, boy oh boy did Doug make an 180 degree turn and all hell broke loose. The epic music on the background and Doug's bloody figure, an ex Democrat now turned pro guns Republican, is one of the best moments ever! I thought he was gonna die first but I was so wrong. I laughed so hard and loudly cheered for the guy in the end! This is not a horror movie but you will laugh.MURICA!",4,1,3,31 August 2018
