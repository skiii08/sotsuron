Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It's a great movie!
","I was hestitant when I first went to see this movie.  I heard what the critics said and I was fearful I would see this movie and it would put a major downer on the trilogoy, a set of movies that I love dearly.  It's not Star Wars, even George Lucas said that.   But Star Wars was one of those magical movies that only come once in a lifetime and we have to move on to new movies.The Phantom Menance, first off, was a technological wonder.  The special effects were the best I have ever seen.  Just as some of the critics were stating, the plot was somewhat weak, especially in the middle.  But I did not leave disappointed, the action sequences were incredible; they left you breathless at times.  And yes, at the end of the movie the audience I was at was on their feet and applauding.I think George created an excellent movie and he has some good building blocks for the next 2 installments of the movie.  The writing needs to be cleaned up some.  I'll be seeing this movie at least 3 more times since I promised several kids I know that I would take them to see the movie.",10,0,0,19 May 1999
The Iron Giant," This is the best of children animated films
","My nephews live in a town that has one of those 2nd-run movie theaters. This week it was Iron Giant and I really didn't think I'd want to sit through this movie.  My nephews, ages 9 & 7 insisted they wanted to see it, not because it was the rage of all the kids (no one heard of it), but because it was just playing at the theater and was a cartoon.Boy was I surprised.  I went into this movie thinking I'd catch a quick nap and instead I was captivated by this incredible movie.  Not only did my nephews love it, but so did I.  It was a great plot with an excellent storyline/moral.  Great animation too! It's not a fluke that this move has an 8.7 rating at IMDB, it should probably go higher.  Compared to some of the latest offerings from Disney, this movie outshines most of them (It was head and shoulders above Disney's Tarzan and Dreamwork's Prince of Egypt). Take your kids to see this movie, better yet, buy it for them.  This will be a timeless classic in children's animation.",10,1,2,22 November 1999
