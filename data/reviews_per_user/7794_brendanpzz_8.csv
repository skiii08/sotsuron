Blade Runner 2049," Confusing.
",When watching this film I just didnt get it at all just felt like it tried to hard to be futuristic and mysterious,5,3,5,26 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Better than I expected!
",I think it's a great end to the Skywalker saga. Yes it could of been better but I'm happy with what was delivered. The lightsabre duels were 10x better out the 3 new films I have to say and the references to the old characters are just Brilliant was nice to see the gang back together in the end. All in all watch it and be your own judge but dont listen to the really low scores it's just people nit picking.,8,4,10,21 December 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Great film! One of Tarantino's best. Could be shorter though.
","This film is awesome to watch it's so well filmed. Tarantino has got every detail done to the best he can for showing his version of 1969 hollywood/LA. My only thing I had to complain about is its the length. There was just some bits in the film you just thought ok was that needed, but I guess that's all the fun Tarantino makes in his films he makes an eye for detail and confrontation between characters. All in all I loved it especially the ending it had me in stitches. Reccomend to anyone to watch if you can stay with it. Top Mark's for Tarantino yet again!",9,1,5,26 August 2019
Aladdin," Still got that magic
",It was good I know I'm late to the party to post a review but I liked it. It's great film for the family or just anyone that wants to watch something with a happy ending. I must admit I never saw the orginal Aladdin so been nice to go in not knowing completely what happens. I think the casting of will Smith was the best part about this film he made the role his own and makes it shine and it's all the little things to like the fly carpet is just smile maker whenever it did something quirky it made me smile and chuckle. My only negative thing I had to say about this film is the singing. I just found the actor to play Aladdin just didnt have that stand out voice in my opinion but jasmine my god what a voice!! Any who watch this film if your in a I want feel good film mood because that's this film.,8,1,1,7 February 2020
The Lion King," It's good but not amazing
","When I saw this was to come out I thought fantastic one of my childhood favourites. But when I got to see the final version I was happy with it but it still doesn't compare to the original. It might just be me but when there singing the songs maybe I'm just hearing the old version in my head still. But still great film and great re imagination. My only complaint is i just didn't feel like beyonce was the best to act the part, but her singing though amazing! Just her voice acting just felt too diva'ish in my opinion. But that shouldn't spoil the film for other viewers, its just my personal opinion.",8,1,3,26 August 2019
1917," Feel lucky for the life you live!
",Lest we forget those that have fallen! I cant describe in words how compelling this film is. This is a film you watch and take in the devastating trauma these people lived. The cinematography of this film is the best I've ever seen! This is film that will be remembered forever in history and will always be the best we can get to reliving these horrific moments these people experienced in history most devastating war. Watch this film!!! You will sit there in silent as I did as the credits went on.,10,0,0,23 February 2020
The King," Wow
",Its dark. Its gritty. Its bloody. Its intense. Its fantastic to look at with amazing cinematography and great acting all round. The ending is the icing on the cake for me so intense. Robert Patterson was brilliant also was nice to see him in a different role to really show he can act. A must see film.,9,5,9,6 November 2019
13 Hours," What's the world coming too!
",I love films like this that open your eyes to these types of conflicts and my lord the fire power and gun fights a unreal and so well shot. From the first fire fight to the next you can just feel the action and tension of not knowing who is your enemy. This is bays best film by a long shot!! And any way of topic and not to be disrespectful to those that died but I'd love to those actors filming this film playing with all that fire power was probably so much fun to get stuck in with all the rifles and explosions!,10,2,2,8 February 2020
