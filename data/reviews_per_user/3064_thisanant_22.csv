The Lobster," and the donkey
","WHY WAS I ATTRACTED TO THIS MOVIE? 1.Colin Farrell is one of my favorite star(seven psychopaths is a classic). 2.it is listed in comedy genre and I love comedies. 3.I like most Rachel Weisz movies. I DISLIKED IT BECAUSE 1.it was super slow (like a snail !) 2.there was almost zero chemistry between the leads. 3.felt like found footage kind of movie,no production value. 4.no story,just a new and weird thought. 5.filled with sadness and cruelty. 6.IT IS NOT A COMEDY RATHER A TRAGEDY. YOU MAY LIKE IT IF YOU LIKE boring cruel stupid drama. YOU MAY HATE IT IF YOU HATE stupid tragedy drama .",1,3,4,25 April 2017
Blade Runner 2049," runs slow
","I have not seen the first blade runner but i decided to watch it as i am a huge fan of sci fi genre . i also like ryan gosling movies ( crazy stupid love , gangester squad , drive , all good things etc ) however i have hated the director's previous movies due to their slow pacing and this one is not much different . everything else seems great . may be the huge dependence on the 
first movie resulted in poor box office results .",9,0,3,6 January 2018
In Bruges," in a stupid movie
","WHY WAS I ATTRACTED TO THIS MOVIE? 1.Martin McDonagh is the director of this movie who is also the director of SEVEN PSYCHOPATHS, a classic and one of my favorites. 2.Colin Farrell stars in the movie, I love most of his movies. 3.I like comedies.

YOU MAY LIKE IT IF YOU LIKE long monologues,boring story,sad people behaving suicidal YOU MAY HATE IT IF YOU HATE boring movies MOVIES LIKE THIS none JUDGEMENT avoid it.",1,1,14,24 April 2017
Fight Club," Fight for true civilization
","This ain't a movie . It is a religion , it is a sermon on the mountain , it is a pop song . Most suited for hippies and hipsters though , not for everyone , I am afraid . The Disney fans should really need to avoid it . This movie makes you see the world in a different way and you may not like it .",10,1,2,11 December 2017
Madagascar," Mad animals
","I have always enjoyed animation comedies ( Megamind , Monsters vs Aliens ,The Lego movie ) due to availability of options cause they are not limited by natural laws . this is pretty funny movie , I wonder when are they gonna make a stand alone movie about Julian and his crew .",8,1,1,10 January 2018
Deadpool 2," Dead inside
","As a spoof of superhero genre with constantly breaking the fourth wall and all the jokes at the expense of pop culture , this sure is funny but it should not be , at least , praised cause it is a bad tradition .",6,5,9,22 October 2018
The Terminator," on the origin of possible human annihilation ( part 1 )
","It is the best movie i have seen from the eighties . the chemistry between the two leads is palatable , you can almost taste it . it is , I believe , the original sci-fi with time travel and cyborgs . the best James Cameron movie , other than AVATAR 7 that is .",10,3,8,19 January 2018
BlacKkKlansman," not as weird as the title
","Honestly , I have been having difficulty pronouncing this movie's name ever since I heard about it . nonetheless , it was quite light hearted and message containing at the same time .",7,0,1,28 November 2018
Megamind," mega fun
","WHY WAS I ATTRACTED TO THIS MOVIE? 1.the director of this movie, TOM MCGRATH is also the director of Madagascar, one of the best animation comedy so. 2.i love animation comedies. 3.i love 'mind' movies. I LIKED IT BECAUSE 1.the best animation comedy ( maybe second best now that I have seen THE LEGO MOVIE ). 2.fully hilarious throughout ( if you laughed watching Madagascar , you are gonna cry in this , with joy ! )YOU MAY LIKE IT IF YOU LIKE hilarious animation comedies YOU MAY HATE IT IF YOU HATE laughing MOVIES LIKE THIS 1.Madagascar. 2.monsters vs aliens. 3.the LOGO movie. 4.wreck it Ralph.",10,0,0,26 April 2017
Nightcrawler," crawls under the skin
","I have sometimes liked Jake Gyllenhal movies ( Prince of Persia , End of Watch , Donnie Darko , Source Code ,Accidental Love ) and sometimes hated (Prisoners ) but always loved his intensity . he is as intense as Christian Bale or Di Caprio and this is by far his most diverse looking role . he is sad ,angry , cunning , happy , manipulative and everything his role demands . a simple drama thriller elevated to highest , single handed by Gyllenhal . supporting cast is magnificent as well . the movie is morally dark . I have become huge fan of Jake and I think he is suitable as the next Batman .",9,0,0,5 January 2018
Watchmen," watch it for the darkness
","this movie is based on a comic book/graphic novel or something that i have not read. i wanted to watch this cause 1. i watch most of the Patrick Wilson movies ( after i watched HARD CANDY , INSIDIOUS ). also , 2.i like action , mystery movies . 3.zack Snyder has directed 300 which i loved. i watch a lot of movies but mostly for entertainment purposes and i am not a big artist or critic. this is amazing , great story telling , visually stunning , very well acted , great action scenes appropriate music and RORSCHACH ! yes it is the name of a character i loved and worshiped. every one must watch this who liked 1. the dark knight. 2. v for vendetta.",10,0,1,24 May 2017
Justice League," just what I thought
","First of , the biggest difference between DC and marvel movies is that DC movies feel like the comics have come to life . this is a great movie , loved the chemistry , no wonder it has such big budget , looks impossible , thumbs up for the people behind the movie , the future of DC looks promising , they already have an impressive array of animated movies , best of which is JL War . way better than marvel crap . LOVED IT .",10,3,9,18 February 2018
Wanted," I want a sequel
","When you see Angelina Jolie in a movie , it becomes hard for others to get noticed but James mcAvoy showed his talent in this movie that became well known in next years ( Filth ) . great action movie and it is funny too .",10,2,3,17 January 2018
We're the Millers," we are amused
","Jason Sudeikis ( Horrible Bosses , Movie 43 ) has a great comedic talent and supported by fine story , hilarious dialogues and funny cast including Ed Helms ( The Hangover ) and that kid from Narnia , makes this movie fun to watch .",10,0,3,17 January 2018
A Quiet Place," way too quiet
","A quite horror ? I would never have guessed it until this movie was announced . It is ok , a supernatural thriller , a family in danger and other cliches",5,0,1,23 October 2018
The Dark Knight," The joker ( featuring Batman )
","You haven't seen this ? well that sounds like the ninth wonder of the world or maybe the eighth or so i don't know my GK is non existent . so the movie is undoubtedly my most favorite movie and this joker is undoubtedly my most favorite hero . ( don't get me wrong , Batman is still my most favorite superhero ) if you have ever watched a movie , you need to watch this . and there is one more thing , WHY SO SERIOUS ?",10,0,0,10 January 2018
Beauty and the Beast," nothing beautiful here
","i often have difficulty understanding the box office performances of movies as to why some entertaining movies for example The man from uncle under perform and some boring trash like this crosses 500 million in us and 1 billion worldwide , maybe because it is a family genre movie , whole family buys tickets to sit together and pass time without risk of much embarrassment ( and fun ) . bad acting , zero chemistry , no humor , shallow story and nothing else .",3,1,2,9 December 2017
The Fountain," found the fear of loss
","I was once a fan of mystery genre and I watched this due to the name of Hugh Jackman . This was fantastic . No wonder it was commercially unsuccessful . One of the best and one of a kind . Amazing story , great acting and direction . It is visually stunning and emotionally fulfilling . Just don't expect a mindless blockbuster and you will be rewarded .",10,2,4,20 January 2018
The Matrix," the merits of creativity
","The importance of this movie ( for me ) can be understood from the fact that any movie I am going to watch , I place in two groups , before 1999 and after 1999 . the action is unique , the story , a sum of spiritual and scientific concepts , in short , it is fully extraordinary .",10,0,2,19 January 2018
Annihilation," annoying loopholes
","The thing with good Netflix movies is that they start fresh , with a new world ( Where is Monday , Bright ) or in this case , a possibility of one , then they build on the start and then there is the conclusion which doesn't answer much of the plot . so if you wanna watch a sci-fi with above features , go for it",6,1,2,28 March 2018
The Ugly Truth," true and funny
","I am a fan of Gerard Butler ( Law Abiding Citizens , 300 ) and Katherine Heigl ( One for the money , Knocked up , Life as we know it and almost all of her movies ) and comedy genre and this movie satisfied me and my present theory of love , it is funny , Katherine Heigl is , as always , charming and uncomfortable and Butler does the job . it is really offensive , though .",8,1,2,17 January 2018
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," o dear
","I sometimes like these directors's movies and sometimes I don't . George Clooney is on fire here , aptly supported by the cast and the scores are fantastic .
fully hilarious .",8,1,1,23 January 2018
