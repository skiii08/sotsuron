Iron Man 3," No Iron Man would endure should endure seeing this movie
","How can anyone really say this is a movie which is remotely above average rating? There is nothing in the movie which is new or innovative. Just the same lame run of the mill action herky jerky as the second installment (which, unbelievably, is worse yet!).Trailer looked promising, execution on movie obviously sub-par. The emotions and more gritty feel of the trailer was extremely misleading, as the actual movie is somewhat more akin to comedy than drama.Marvel franchise is getting drive to the ground with this bullshit. What ever happened to the Tony Stark of Iron Man 1, where the character evolvement actually makes sense? In this latest installment, the very-hard-to-believe anxiety attacks and the mushy interaction between the 'Mechanic' and the all-too-cute little town boy is completely over the top. Whoever came up with this story arc should seriously rethink his career... Only bright spot is Robert Downey JRs usual great dialogue and Ben Kingsleys erratic Mandarin character.Would not recommend this to anyone with an IQ above normal house temperature Celsius.",4,4,8,3 May 2013
