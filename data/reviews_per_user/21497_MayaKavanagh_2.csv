Skyfall," Changed my tune pretty quickly
","I had heard a lot from friends and family about their impressions of Skyfall. Some with film backgrounds, some without, but I can honestly say their was a severe divide between everyone about this film. Some absolutely hated it whilst others thought it was the best Bond film yet. Needless to say, I went into that cinema with mixed emotions.Thankfully, these soon dissipated after an enthralling action sequence which started off the film in good strides. Motorcycles being thrown at cameras and riding across rooftops; Bond and his assailant committing an epic train fight stunt; and a thrilling cliff hanger right before the opening titles, all told the audience the old Bond was back with some new tricks. The impressive detail to cinematography, set design, and editing were absolute standouts amongst all the production values for Skyfall and the heads of these departments should be extremely proud. Continuity and makeup were lacking precision in some scenes but that's forgivable in light of the film's scope and vision. Speaking of, Sam Mendes' exceptional directing skills shone throughout this film, with his intentions clearly sustained for the film's entirety. Acting gongs must be given out to Javier Bardem for his spine-chilling portrayal of Tiago Rodriguez, a name I won't be forgetting in a while, and Daniel Craig of course, for managing to show us Bond's various weaknesses in the short time he was given, amongst all the bravado we know him for.Finally, and possibly the most impressive element of the whole film, was its introduction of 'the new era', a term constantly referred to throughout the film. The point was well-made by the production team that the Bond we all know and love is no more. A world of guns, grenades and Bond girls is no match for the new wave of 'cyber crime' we are experiencing each day. As the 'new' Q comments 'I can do more damage on my laptop, sitting in my pajamas, before my first cup of Earl Grey than you can do a year in the field.' Bond-lovers who expect the crew behind this legendary story to maintain the 'old ways' are told repeatedly throughout Skyfall they are foolish for expecting such a thing when the world is constantly changing and its up to Bond and Mi6 to keep up the best way they can.Skyfall is for me, everything I love in a Bond film. Action scenes were a step above the precedent; new characters provided a refreshing change to an old narrative; and the focus and care taken by the production crew in all their capacities is inspirational. Its films like these that makes me want to work in the film industry. Well done 007.More reviews available at mayakavanagh. blogspot. com",7,1,7,25 November 2013
Looper," A time-travel film that focuses on the past
","In the same way hundreds of critics applauded Hitchcock for Psycho, Scorsese for Good Guys, and Tarantino for Pulp Fiction, this movie is just one of those amazing films that needs to be written about.Looper tells a twisted tale of time travel, assassinations and violent ends for violent beings but most of all, explores the bigger picture of how we as humans battle ourselves each day to determine what is right for the future. Starring Bruce Willis, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Emily Blunt (who can not be said to be a 'star' of the movie as such considering she doesn't rock up until halfway through), the film tackles many complicated themes with an equally complicated plot, the two points I will be focusing on for this analysis. There are so many amazing qualities of this movie that can be discussed ...To read more, please head to the following link: http://mayakavanagh.blogspot.com.au/2012/10/looper.html",8,0,2,28 October 2012
