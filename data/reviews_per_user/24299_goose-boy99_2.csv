It," One of the best films of the year!
","I'm not huge on horror films, and have only been exposed to classics like Scream, and Alien, however when the first trailer for IT dropped, something about it intrigued me. I have never seen the original miniseries so I have nothing to compare it to, so this was really my first killer clown experience. This film is absolutely amazing, and presents not only terrifying scares, but also a surprising amount of both heart and humour. The cast of children exhibited stellar performances, and Bill Skarsgård's portrayal of Pennywise sent shivers down my spine. Tension is captured excellently, through both the music and screen, and the gore adds to a very disturbing yet somehow enjoyable experience. All characters are explored to a great depth, and even the less focused on characters had stand out moments. I am glad I saw this on opening day, and will definitely be added to my Blu-Ray collection. This may possibly be one of my favourite films ever! Absolutely outstanding!",9,6,15,10 September 2017
Alien: Covenant," A Worthy Entry into the 'Alien' Franchise
","I am a huge fan of the Alien franchise, and consider Ridley Scott's 'Alien' to be one of my favourite movies, so when I heard he was returning to direct the sequel to 'Prometheus' I was very excited to see what he had in store. After watching this film I was glad that I was extremely satisfied with the overall result. It successfully recaptures the tension and suspense of 'Alien' while also being a decent sequel to 'Prometheus'. First and foremost, this is clearly an Alien movie, and there are numerous elements of the film that provide satisfaction for die-hard fans of the series such as myself, with the inclusion of things like Jerry Goldsmith's beautiful 'Alien' score (now remastered by Jed Kurzel), countless nods and references to the original film, and a creature that sparks the same amount of terror in audiences as the one in 1979. All of the cast members showcased amazing performances, however the stand-out was definitely Michael Fassbender, with his portrayal of David, the android from Prometheus, as well as Walter, a new and extremely different android. The cinematography was beautiful, and special effects of both the creatures, and spaceships were top notch. The film provides answers to burning questions from 'Prometheus' as well as creating new and intriguing questions for a possible sequel. My only flaw of the film is that it falls victim to the clichés of horror, and can prove to be obvious when a character is about to be killed. Luckily, jump-scares are minimal, as the film relies much more on tension and suspense to create fear. All in all, I believe the film is very good, and will definitely be adding it to my Blu-Ray collection.",8,72,134,12 May 2017
