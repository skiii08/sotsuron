The Double Life of Véronique," Art in its maximum expression
","Music, image and script combines to offer a very personal work. The film transcends the usual conventions. Do not waste time with unnecessary dramas or unrealistic love stories, and shows us something very unusual: the feminine inner world, subtle perceptions, intuition, omens, strange coincidences...The unspoken moments in the film reveals an intimate atmosphere along the dreamlike and sensual photography. Irene Jacob does an amazing job so natural that it is. Also highlight the music, as in the trilogy BLUE, RED AND WHITEIt is a movie to let go,see it without preconceived ideas.10/10",10,1,3,20 September 2014
Black Swan," In the Wings of Paranoia
","There are usually two common mistakes in movie goers and reviewers:1-'I watched this film on the basis of the great reviews it had received'.2-'The movie doesn't portray any of the beauty and passion of that art' . (in this case: ballet)....We will be always be betrayed by expectations.Who said that 'Black Swan' is a film about ballet...? IMHO , the film is mainly psychological. Portrays the relationships between people in which it is often alignment, sexual repression, competitiveness, harassment ...which can lead to paranoia, and it has been used as allegorical background, a ballet performance. Simple as that.About the clichés, the movie remains good with it. In fact, these clichés actually happen.8/10",8,0,2,12 December 2015
Cast Away," I'm sorry.....i'm not a Tom Hanks fan.
","There are some Hollywood actors who engender sympathy to the public,but (since my point of view) don't play a character but themselves. When i see 'Saving Private Ryan' i don't see 'Captain Miller' i'm still seeing Tom Hanks. In 'The Terminal' i don't see Viktor Navorski i see Tom Hanks.Of course, for Hollywood this is an ace up its sleeve since a lot of people go to the movies because of the actors who play in it.Having said that, The movie is OK and well made, but it would have been more credible with a different actor. Anyway not the best of Zemeckis who is a great director.6/10",6,0,1,21 November 2015
Gone Girl," People get amazed with twists......so?
","This is what movie's all about...twists? The plot and the script (which are at the service of the 'twists') are not credible, so the movie provides the same features as the typical after-lunch entertainment TV movie.It is a shame that a director such David Fincher could have plumbed such depths. Furthermore, it seems logical to satisfy both adapting to the times and practical needs. Even so, Fincher still remains one of my favorite live directors. But it's fairly common that early movies (in most cases), are the best. To maintain quality over time it's beyond the reach of most. Only directors as Peter Weir, Andrei Tarkovsky, Krzysztof Kieslowski, Joseph Losey...to name just a few, are able to keep with that level of excellence.4/10",4,4,6,28 May 2016
The Game," Surprise after surprise.
","This movie hooked me from the beginning.The first minutes are not spectacular, but really atmospheric and disquieting.This is my favorite Michael Douglas performance along with 'Falling Down'. He portraits a nasty businessman who does not care about anyone but himself. At first you hate the character, but then you start to empathize with him . Anyway, his attitude will be 'rewarded'... The way in which will be rewarded this attitude, is the point of the movie. And this way is surprising and original. Even if you guess the end of the movie, or you think is predictable, it is still original.I want to highlight the presence of Deborah Kara Unger (Crash), who has a remarkable performance in the film.8/10",8,1,2,4 December 2015
1917," Just another Hollywood War Movie.
","The usual: very well done, very good special effects, the travelling of the trenches, the music, etc, etc ...
But then the movie is totally spoiled by the cheesy script, the intention to over-dramatize, and a lot of cliches ...More examples from this era, when the spectacular is on the same level as the false, the cheesy, and the artificial: Hacksaw Ridge, Saving Private Ryan, Flags of Our Fathers, Dunkirk, Lone Survivor, Windtalkers, Crimnson Tide ... .These directors should see again the great films of this genre, which seems to have been forgotten: Apocalypse Now, Paths of Glory, The Deer Hunter, Der Untergang, Das Boot, All Quiet on the Western Front ...",4,5,7,2 May 2020
Everest," Top of the World....Big Graveyard
","As climber, I must say that I liked the film. We must try not to compare it with the book (for evident reasons) which is much more complete, the characters are more defined, and the relationships between them makes the story more intense. I would say that the film is very focused on what happens to guide Rob Hall and Beck Weathers, but there are many interesting characters and events who are portrayed blurred. For example Anatoli Boukreev, who was instrumental in the story, appears in the background, the relationship between Rob Hall and Scott Fisher, Sandy Pittman...Importantly, Krakauer's book has generated significant criticism to the point that the guide Anatoli Boukreev (which was criticized by some) wrote 'The Climb' in response Krakauer's book.Yet the film is beautifully shot and deserves note. It is appreciated that has not fallen into the sensationalism and lack of rigour of other Hollywood climbing movies as we all know.7,5/10",7,1,2,19 September 2015
Super 8," Good Hollywood entertainment, but obviously not much more to offer.
","One of the reasons i watched this movie was that, initially, remind me at those 80's movies like E.T., Poltergeist, Explorers, etc.The movie takes place in 1979 and has that characteristic aesthetics of that time.From the beginning, the movie is interesting and is made with the right pace. It has been created unstable family situations, in order to reinforce the drama. Anyway, for now, the movie works and keeps you guessing.In the end, 'Hollywood effect' came swiftly with the typical military deployment, probably unnecessary. From there, the movie begins to lose its strength.As popcorn movie deserves note, but it belongs to a genre where quality cinema is not common.6/10",6,0,0,13 December 2015
Whiplash," Artificial Drama
","I give a 4/10 because J.K. Simmons performance and good music.Otherwise, it's a film that is neither realistic nor credible.It is obvious that that has been written and directed by a young director, as consistency conspicuous by its absence: since the dramatic and exaggerated concept has been put ahead to good sense and tact.All the drumming-bleeding scenes are misplaced (nobody bleeds as a result of playing drums), as well as the attitude of students to a teacher who is totally unbearable: chairs crashing against the wall, insulting and disrespecting them constantly .... which students replies with an incredible: 'yes, sir!' as if they were in the Army ... Today, i think anyone can't put up with that kind of attitude unless you have a very low self esteem.4/10",4,4,10,7 February 2016
Halloween," Plain and simple: Horror....but nothing else
","Nothing more, nothing less...I have to say that i like horror movies, but there is only a 1% which actually scared me. I REALLY don't like the typical slasher-gore films: really boring, without any kind of interest. The most of them are not scary at all. The only thing i can find are just tons of Ketchup Tomato. That's all.The best Horror movies are usually psychological, it has an intelligent plot and blood effects only when needed.: The Omen, The Exorcist, Rosemary's Baby, Angel Heart, Alien, The Changeling (1980)...'Halloween' has a simple plot, so the story itself is not interesting.But....The film is designed such the viewer can feel the sensation of 'fear' in a constant manner. Slasher-gore is about 'to show'. And has no interest.Psychological horror is about 'to suggest'. And keeps you guessing.With a low budget and almost no SFX all the suspense charge lies on pure cinematic means: camera and music. The pace, quite slow to be a horror movie, music is chilling and constant and subjective camera well managed by John Carpenter, results in a good horror movie that will leave you chained to your seat.8/10",8,5,7,7 December 2015
Contact," And the Stars Go With You...
","This film depicts one of the most fascinating human searches.Fortunately, instead of focusing only on a scientific point of view, also provides a spiritual dimension, which is essential to be meaningful and depth.Carl Sagan firmly believed in life on other planets, and this fact is well portrayed in the character played by Jodie Foster. His tenacity, motivation and fascination with outer space, bore fruit. The topic: 'fight for a dream' appears perfectly reflected here.This is a story in which science, beliefs, relationships, challenges, are interspersed.Science and spirituality had always been separated as two different or opposite worlds.With quantum physics, their paths have had no choice but to cross, and finally have agreed. Life and (mostly) death, are viewed from another angle. Although, certainly, there are still many things to explain.8,5/10",8,0,1,15 December 2015
All the President's Men," Unfortunately this could not happen nowadays.
","This is why this movie is a rare gem: At that time, all the system worked and the President had no other choice but to resign.This is remarkably portrayed by the script and all the staff: Alan J.Pakula who was an admirable director, Redford, Hoffman...all the supporting cast was very accurate. Hal Holbrook deserves special mention in his 'Deep Throat' rol.the plot seems taken from a spy movie but it was real.Can you imagine nowadays an investigation which concludes with the current President resignation...? i don't think so. The judiciary and the president were not so connected (bought) as they are now. Today's democracy is a myth. This movie is a prefect example of how an impeachment should work. Nowadays not even reach that: a little reprimand and that would be all...The film was made in the most similar way about how actually the events occurred, and keeps you in a sort of suspense which goes progressively increasing.9/10",9,1,1,28 November 2015
