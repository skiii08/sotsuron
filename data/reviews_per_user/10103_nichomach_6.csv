Skyfall," The best Bond for some considerable time
","I was apprehensive after Quantum of Solace, which I felt was deeply disappointing. A weak plot with a weaker villain, a stilted script and limp direction. I was still convinced by Craig as Bond, but the material he had to work with was poor.Skyfall is a very different kettle of fish; gripping from the opening chase scene through markets and over rooftops, it rapidly explores themes of loyalty and betrayal which will be carried throughout the film. Craig is once again a convincing Bond, matching ruthlessness with wit, convincing equally in hand to hand combat or the casino. Dench's M this time captures a brittle hardness that hadn't previously been quite so much to the fore, and plays well to the plot. The new Q is convincingly dismissive initially of the old hat methods of field agents like Bond. Bardem's villain is especially praiseworthy; flesh-creepingly unhinged, he brings palpable menace to the role.The action is well-paced, the dialogue taut and the plot development well-handled. I thoroughly recommend it.",9,2,14,1 November 2012
Underworld," A rattling good yarn...
","Strong performances, a taut storyline and well-handled direction make this an excellent action film. Beckinsale shines as Selene, and Nighy's turn as Viktor has me halfway convinced that he actually IS a creature of the night. The effects are thorough without being intrusive, and there's no sense of 'CGI overload'. Scott Speedman handles the role of Michael well, conveying the character's disorientation and confusion excellently, as well as bringing real presence to the d√©nouement. I'm going to mention Beckinsale again, because she's simply fabulous; coolly distant one minute, furiously impassioned the next, she brings a welcome range and depth to a role that could so easily have been botched (sorry Alba, there's only one Dark Angel, and she drives a Maserati... *grin*). A film that doesn't pretend to be anything other than excellent entertainment, and it doesn't have to. Thoroughly enjoyable throughout.",8,1,2,28 June 2007
Underworld Awakening," Excellent addition to the series
","Underworld: Awakening is a fast-paced action movie, with excellent performances from all the cast. Reminiscent of Underworld: Evolution in its unrelenting pace, it actually feels like a significantly more cohesive effort than that. I liked U:E, but at times it felt too much like a progression of set-pieces rather than a continuous narrative. Fortunately, the adroit pacing, strong plot and convincing performances here neatly avert any such misgivings with U:A. Beckinsale is excellent again, taking the character of Selene forward and establishing a new battleground for our favourite death-dealer, Stephen Rea makes a convincingly sinister evil mastermind, Michael Ealy turns in a good solid performance, Kris Holden-Ried's Quint is appropriately savage while India Eisley's debut in the series promises great things should it continue and should she remain involved in it (which I hope she does). A nice cameo from Charles Dance (I've always suspected that he wasn't entirely human...) rounds things out nicely. Frankly, I'm only knocking a point off for it being too short, and if that's the worst I can say of a movie, then they're doing something right...",9,7,15,26 January 2012
Prometheus," A fine addition to the Alien canon
","****SPOILERS**** I thoroughly enjoyed this film , and while i recognize that there are some weaknesses and unanswered questions, I would heartily recommend it nonetheless.Weaknesses first; the motivation of the engineers could have been more fully explained. Against this I would set the fact that this is a question deliberately set up (I hope) for another film at the end. More time could have been taken for character development; perhaps a fuller cut would address this ('cause it's not like Scott's averse to filling in the story of a film in the DVD release...). The 'twist' with Vickers turning out to be Weyland's daughter was so heavily foreshadowed by her being there at all, the comment in his video message about David being the nearest thing to a son that he'd ever have and so forth that I hardly think it counts.OK, that's out of the way. Rapace, Fassbender and Marshall-Green turn in excellent performances. Rapace melds a lively intelligence with a combination of vulnerability and strength. Fassbender's David effectively conjures the spirit of Pinnocchio combined with a ruthlessness redolent of Ian Holm's Ash. Although not given nearly enough screen time to develop, Marshall-Green brings an infectious enthusiasm to the role of Charlie. Elba and Theron are effective in their roles rather than inspiring, but to a certain extent it is down to Rapace (Shaw), Fassbender (David), and Marshall-Green (Holloway) to carry the story and this they do very well. I am hoping that the aged Pearce is a hint that another film may develop Weyland's character more.The cinematography is excellent, and the overall design strongly reminiscent of the first film, not merely with regard to the aliens, or the discovered ship but also the Prometheus itself whose internal fittings and layout feel very reminiscent of the Nostromo. I saw the film in 3D and this is one of the better usages of 3D that I've seen. Although there are obvious showcase scenes (the stellar map in the discovered ship being a striking example) overall, the effect felt natural.I had no issues with the script; in most sci-fi films, some proportion of the dialogue will always be expository, and I feel that Prometheus handled this well.Overall, while the film is not perfect, I found it highly enjoyable and a very worthwhile addition to the Alien canon; certainly superior to Resurrection and 3.",8,2,7,4 June 2012
The Woman in Black," A good film spoilt
","I really wanted to like this film more than my score would suggest, and indeed I did. Radcliffe was excellent as was the ever-reliable Ciaran Hinds. The film looked great, and the location was well-chosen. The film built tension very well at the start, conjuring the sense of creeping dread found in M.R. James' scarier works; the script was deft, and I thoroughly settled in, looking forward to a good scare. Except...well...it all went a bit wrong. The overuse of jump-scares that really should be left to Youtube reaction videos was my first gripe, but the sourest note was struck by a deeply unsatisfying ending that seemed to arrive too early, and just left me hanging, wondering 'Was that it?'; my wife felt much the same. Overall, I was left with the feeling that a potentially great film had been missed.",6,0,0,20 August 2012
Midway," Good, but not great
","I will preface this by saying that I very much enjoyed this movie, but I think that it had significant weaknesses.For a film ostensibly about Midway, it spent an awful lot of its runtime covering Pearl Harbor and the Doolittle Raid (yet oddly almost none on the Battle of the Coral Sea). This seemed to lead into an awful lot of foreshortening and simplification of Midway itself.With that being said, it was well-paced, with good performances, and covered a lot of the essentials well. Details such as the 'water' message from Midway were well-placed, as were refernces to the well-known shortcomings of the Bliss-Leavitt Mk XIII aerial torpedo ('clunk'), and the TBD Devastator torpedo bomber (although in the actual battle the USN had 6 of the newer, faster, better armed and armoured TBF Avengers and lost 5 of those, so it wasn't just the planes).I was surprised to see comparatively little involvement depicted of the fighters in the actual battle, and I think that not enough explanation was given of the US Navy's plan for coordinated aerial attacks with torpedo bombers at low level, dive bombers from high level with fighter cover provided by the F4Fs, and importantly why that didn't happen and its devastating conseuences in terms of the virtual annihilation of the torpedo squadrons.In all, I think it was a good film that simply tried to cover too much historical ground in too short a time. For all that, I enjoyed it and would recommend it as a good war movie.",7,1,2,17 November 2019
