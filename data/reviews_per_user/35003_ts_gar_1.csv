The Mask," 10!!!
",I consider this movie genius. The magic and the real world combined create an atmosphere that is so complicated and enchanting. The viewer becomes part of the story. I LOVE how Jim Kerry plays his part. His comedy style appeals to me and touches to a deep level. You love with the character and cry with the character. This movie is The Godfather of the comedy!,10,2,2,16 March 2017
