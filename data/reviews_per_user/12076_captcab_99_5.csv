The Blair Witch Project," Sometimes when I'm lost in the woods......
","I throw my map away.  I laughed out loud in the theatre.  Throw the map away, hee, hee, hee.  The little stick figures hanging from the tree were a little freaky but scary?  Hell no!  I wanted to see the Blair Witch, what does he/she look like?  Is it just an old man with a bad disposition or a monster?  Show me, tell me damn it!!!",3,1,3,22 March 2002
Training Day," Very entertaining
",It was good to see Denzel play a bad guy.  At first I wasn't sure if he was really up to no good or if he was just educating the new guy.  The ending gets a little carried away but it's still entertaining none the less.  Saw it in the theatre and I will rent it to watch it again.  It's that good.,8,1,11,22 March 2002
Being John Malkovich," John Cusak is the worst
","J. Cusak hasn't starred in a good movie since Better Off Dead.  This movie wasn't funny or good.  It was different, I'll give it that.  I like the idea of looking through someone else's eyes but it gets old quick.  If you liked High Fidelity (which I can't understand why) then you'd probably enjoy this train wreck of a film.  Enjoy!",2,1,3,22 March 2002
The Fast and the Furious," nice cars, not so nice acting
","If you like fast cars, bad plots and bad acting definitely see this movie. I wasn't expecting much from this DVD and I got exactly that.  The cars were cool though.  There were some really stupid parts that made me laugh like when the undercover cop is driving his car 160mph and looking at a computer screen at the same time or when the truck hijackers shoot a cable to pull the window out of a moving 18 wheeler.  Too funny.  Enjoy!",Null,0,1,9 January 2002
Blow," Johnny Depp is the man
",This movie is about George Jung and the drug trade he created.  It started with marijuana and grew into cocaine.  To me it seemed very realistic.  Not all drug dealers are killers contrary to other movies like Scarface.  That doesn't mean that dealing drugs is okay but I couldn't help but feel for old Georgie.  One reviewer mentioned that the movie didn't have a message.  I couldn't disagree more.  The message was George was betrayed by his own actions and his own friends and family as well.  In the end all he wanted was the love of his daughter and drugs cost him his one true love.  Johnny Depp played the role perfectly.  I can't wait to watch it again.,8,0,1,22 March 2002
