The King's Speech," A Brilliant Film, A Brilliant Speech!
","'The King's Speech' was superb! After all of the praise this film had been given, I had high expectations which were incredibly exceeded. It was well written with a fantastic choice of cast. It was refreshing watching a film in the 21st century that was so brilliant, yet did not need special effects or over dramatic scenes to capture its audience. I was glued to the screen from beginning to end, scared to tear myself away from the film at any moment, in fear that I would miss a minute of it. The scenes and settings were very believable of the historical time that it portrays. If you don't watch this masterpiece, you truly will be missing out on an impeccable mark in the history of film.",10,0,0,28 June 2011
