The New World," Poor New World
","Colin Farrell is cast in the wrong part. If this movie solely depended on looks and no words he might be good enough. However, there is some occasional dialog! Why would you cast an Irishman to play the Englishman John Smith? Mr. Farrell's strong Irish brogue detracts from the history depicted in the movie. The movie was not as good as I expected it would be, and I like dramas based on historical events. There are some interesting parts and beautiful scenery but this movie is slow and disjointed. The story of Pocohantas is fairly accurately related but you wonder why she bothered to save the Virginia settlements.",2,2,7,8 February 2006
The Monuments Men," Interesting subject, confused screenplay!
",This is a good story based on the WW2 theft of art treasures by the Nazis but it lacks continuity and meaningful direction and screenplay. Various characters are presented but you wonder where they all fit in and what happens to them. There are goofs in the historical sequence of events. With the exception of Matt Damon you wonder if the elderly group of Monuments Men would realistically survive on the Western Front in 1944. Why did Cate Blanchett and Hugh Bonneville want to be in this movie? Cate gives a good performance as a French art gallery curator. Hugh is more uncomfortable in his role as the token British contribution to the mission. He is quite a contrast to his more familiar role as the Earl of Grantham in Downton Abbey. The story is good but the production should have been better. There are a series of vignettes but not tied together well. The subject has not been treated with enough depth.,5,1,1,25 February 2014
