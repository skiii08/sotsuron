The Ring," Ultimately a Disappointment
","The Ring has a great look and a terrific performance from the beautiful Naomi Watts. However The Ring strains the boundaries of credibility. I saw this film in a crowded theater in Times Square on Halloween; at many points during the film the audience wasn't sure whether to be frightened or just laugh (I am aware this can be a defense mechanism against feelings of fright, however some of the plot is truly laughable). The film also leaves many unanswered questions. The ending (the best part of the film) goes on too long trying to tie all these loose ends, and eventually I stopped caring. Some on this board have said this is the scariest film they have seen in years. Perhaps the horror genre doesn't work for me much anymore, but I just wasn't very frightened. The setup of The Ring seems to promise chills galore, but I found them to be few and far between. This is a better horror film than most made these days (that's not saying much), but could have been a lot better. The Ring would make a good DVD or VHS tape rental (no pun intended).",Null,0,0,1 November 2002
Catch-22," A good Adaptation of a Great Novel
","Catch-22 is of my favorite American novels.  The satire is biting and the story is brilliant.  There is no way a big budget Hollywood studio could capture all the novel's nuances in a feature length film.  The novel's 'flow', for one is not one that is easily captured in film format.  Given the fact that this film was backed by a major Hollywood studio, employing a hot shot director (no disrespect to Mr. Nichols intended) and excellent cast, this film was about as good as it could have been.  Perhaps if it was filmed under more independent circumstances (an 'indie' film) such as the film adaptation of Kurt Vonnegut's 'Mother Night', the results would have been more pleasing to many fans of the book.  For those who have seen the movie but not read the book, I certainly invite your input to this public forum.  However, I think you do yourselves a major disservice by not reading this classic - the themes, if not the events are forever timeless.",Null,0,2,30 October 2002
