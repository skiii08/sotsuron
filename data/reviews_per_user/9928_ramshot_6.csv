Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A good start...
","I arrived home from the first showing of the movie 10 minutes ago. Here is how I feel:-The first 30 minutes are bad. Little logics, too many things happening, you can't get into the feeling at all.-It gets better. The kid is not as bad as he could have been, and I didn't find Jar Jar as annoying as some do. He's not very funny, but not so annoying either. Actors are generally good enough. Effects, naturally, were no less than amazing.-The last 30 minutes of the movie were the best moments I have had this far sitting in a theatre. This was Star Wars, this is what I waited for 4 years. I had chills going down my spine, not many movies do that for me. :)I guess it took Lucas some time and practise to remember how to create that magical feeling that we had in the original movies, but the movie gets so good towards the ending, that in my humble oppinion, it very well deserves to be called Star Wars: Episode I(I want my Episode II, and I want it now, because if it's as much better as E5 was compared to E4... No words can describe that ;)",9,7,9,5 August 1999
The Expendables," A huge disappointment
","The latest Rambo movie was one of the best theater experiences I've ever had. It was everything I expected of it and I left the theater with a huge grin on my face. The Expendables, unfortunately, was the exact opposite. It was an attempt to be everything that an action movie fan could ask for, but it failed on almost all accounts. The script was utter rubbish, especially the humor failed to deliver. All the one liners were tired, unimaginative and delivered without feeling. The acting was bad, but this was naturally a given, and it didn't bother me. The worst part, by a mile, was the action. Everything that is wrong in action scenes produced in Hollywood today was there, and it was there in pounds. Angles changing every 0.5 seconds, shaking, nothing but close-ups, confusing angles... All the tricks you can pull to hide the fact that these old men weren't really up for the physical part of their roles, or that they just wanted to take the easy way out. The only saving grace of the film was the last 20 or so minutes, which were filled with nothing but action, some of it decent.On paper it was a great thing that some of my favorite actions stars made a film together, but after having seen the end result, I wish this movie had never been made.",4,15,31,23 August 2010
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Riight... What happened?
","I liked Ep I more than most, and had high hopes for this one. When I looked at imdb after the first few nights in theaters, read about Jar-Jar being almost totally gone and how much better this part was, I was really excited. I so wanted to like this movie.But OUCH. Now first of all, the directing was utterly horrid. It was the worst part of Ep I as well, but Lucas really lost it here. The movie seemed to jump from scene to scene in the most illogical places, action scenes got interrupted, and just when you were getting into a better scene, you get hit with yet another boring 'but I love you, but I am Jedi, oh no, boohoo'-scene. Excuse me, but since when has Star Wars been a soap opera instead of an adventure?Furthermore, Haydensen was horrible, and even the old actors from Ep 1 seemed to have lost some of their interest. Most action scenes were either boring, badly directed or the effects really didn't look too good. I especially was opening my own wrists in the Arena shootout scene, looking at the princess just standing still and shooting around, without a hint of any kind of battle tactics or trying to take cover.One scene, above all others, basically made me hurt, bad. The one with the princess and 'Darth' on the meadow, riding a fat (bad CGI) blob, rolling around, laughing, jumping, kissing... God, me and my friends couldn't believe our eyes, how did that get into the film. Laughter was the only way to go.Only in the very ending did the movie manage to create some of that good old star wars feeling, leaving some hope for a better Ep 3. I just wish lucas would give the directors seat to someone else...",3,54,109,4 December 2002
Spider-Man," Nicely done!
","I've been a Marvel-fan all my life basically, and I have to say that Spider-Man gave me JUST those vibes that I get when reading the comics, and was the first movie to do so. X-men was an ok movie, but it didn't quite manage to capture the feeling of the original comics. The most disturbing flaw in X-men was the fact that the powers really didn't seem all that 'powerful' in the movie as they did in the comics. I mean I could have taken Cyclops on any time with a Luger, you know what I'm saying? Also, these was serious lack of depth in the characters, wherein the comics character development plays a huge part.Now Spider-Man is a totally different story. While all of the effects do not look as good as they could, they certainly do their job well - spider-man is just as fast, agile and flexible as he is in the comics. A friend of mine complained that it didn't look real, but hey, how REAL would a guy who can dodge bullets look in the real world?The story is great. It's basically been told before in the comics tho, but some modifications have been made and things removed to make it better for our viewing pleasure, I guess. However, unlike in many movies based on comics or books, the changes are not too vast. I truly felt like I was watching a movie made out of the comics I've read for years, not something that was loosely 'based' on them. This is a good thing, as Spider-Man is not Marvel's most popular character for nothing.Last but not least, Directer Sam Raimi had earned my respect already with the hilarious Evil Dead movies, but now has proven that he is capable of much more than just blood and guts - Spider-Man is simply great quality entertainment.Go see this one people, Marvelist or not. Just don't take it seriously, it's a _fantasy_ story and you should treat it as such.9/10",9,0,0,16 July 2002
The Shawshank Redemption," Entertainment at its best
","Best drama ever. I've got many favorite movies, and I've always been unable to name my all times favorite movie, since my moods change, sometimes I want comedy, sometimes action, and sometimes, drama. One thing I am sure of tho, and that's the superiority of The Shawshank Redemption amongst it's genre. It may not be completely realistic, it may have a few cliches, but I don't see why some people seem to think that an utterly entertaining and well made movie suddenly isn't just that anymore if it has a few silly things in it.For the last 12 or so years I've watched movies like a true fanatic, thousands and thousands of them, and I've pretty much seen all the ones that count. Everyone has a right to opinions, but I'm telling that you truly do think that this movie doesn't _deserve_ it's place in the top 5 of IMDB, you are clueless.",Null,0,0,20 August 2002
X2: X-Men United," Impressive
","I own the 'X1' DVD almost entirely because I'm a big 'Marvelist', I never thought of it as a very good movie like Spider-Man in my opinion was. X2 is an entirely different story. I went in expecting another simple-plotted and mediocrely directed (yet more or less faithful to the comics) movie, but I got much more than that. First of all I think the Director Bryan Singer did a far better job on this sequel. The script was much more in depth and the new characters were all excellently performed, excluding Pyro whose actor I found annoying. The action was great and inventive, and I think that anyone saying that this movie wasn't faithful enough to the comics needs to wake up, what's the point of telling the exact same stories in the exact same way again? All the characters were more or less as they were in the comics, and that's really all that matters to me.I generally dislike the concept of sequels, as they often tend to, well, suck, partially ruining the potentially good name of the original movie. This time I can't help making an exception and I'm actually looking forward to X3 and knowing Hollywood, I'm sure I will get it. The world of Xmen basically has an infinite amount of stories waiting to be told on the big screen.Great movie, with only a couple of boring bits. 4.5/5 stars, and that's like a full fiver for a film of this type. :)",9,0,0,5 May 2003
