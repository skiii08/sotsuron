Walk the Line," A Walk in the Thin Line
","It seems that there always is a previous praise to those films that are biographical, and the main actor/actress should get lofty credits. Well, 'Walk the Line' disappointed me. Passing through its slow, boring development, Joaquin Phoenix didn't surprise me. His work was mainly done on rough imitations, but not fonding with the spirit of the character. There is no connection between viewer and spectator, mainly if you are not related nor fan of Johnny Cash. To those like us, the story by Mangold will not deepen us emotionally into his life. Reese Witherspon, on the other side, shines and flows on a river of exposè charm and blossoming emotions. She is an angel. The other part of the cast fails to guide the public through their emotions, and we are puzzled on the real conflict and the real rooted problems. Life is hard, yes. But Cash's Life is not honored in this film, it's copied. Besides the Love Story rendering between Cash and Carter, and the moment where Johnny sings his 'Folsom Prison' tune to the agent, there is nothing remarkable within the film.'Walk the Line' failed to satisfy me. It lacks a lot of strength, basically. It is stuck into a limbo of entertainment, with a disappointing Phoenix that fails to feel but only impersonates, with the shining of Whiterspoon and a mix of nice, bewitching soundtrack, that are curiously performed by the main couple, Joaquin and Reese. I can give it the current rating comparing it to 'Ray', both movies where I didn't know the singers portrayed. One sucked me in and the other left me indifferent. See 'Ray' instead, if you're not a die hard of Johnny Cash.",4,4,7,9 December 2007
Mission: Impossible III," Superior Action
","J.J Abrahams from 'Lost' is the master mind of this thrill ride now. You can be plain sure to trust him; his work on the series above mentioned show great professional skills, an excellent manipulation of all cinematic features like music and acting and a talent to create suspense and action. The movie goes through many international landscapes, on neon illuminated cities and tricky settings. Action develops swiftly in its process but intensely in its nature. Sadly, we have to suffer Abrahams interiorizing with Hollywood's custom of extended love scenes and sweet happy endings. Every situation is done against clock, making the movie exciting and action packed, including some great scenes involving a fight with a chopper over a water excluded bridge. This movie will bring you sure entertainment, no doubt. If so Tom Cruise gets to be excessive, there you have a magnificent Phillip Seymour Hoffman to introduce his senorial, high class acting as a villain.Trust this entertainment. This is superior action.",7,0,1,3 November 2007
Lucky Number Slevin," I Have More Fun Thinking on my Problems
","I enjoy quick movies, heist movies and smart movies with great dialogs. I expected to see something like that in this movie, although I didn't knew the director's nature nor career.Boy, was I disappointed. Isn't this a real wanna be movie? I did understand it from head to bottom, but It didn't impress me at all! Maybe it is because of the poor intensity with which the characters were written. I never felt nothing for either Slevin nor her fast-talking Chinese neighbor. He could die and I wouldn't give a thing.The plot left me a huge taste of deja vu. Seen it, and enjoyed it. Basing itself on stereotypes, characters that draw themselves on unfunny fast conversations; with a humor that's far from universal. It's not even humor. Less if pieces of board with no common sense like the characters in the film digress into them.The twist disengages you completely from the movie, thinking that with the poor story awfully developed into snoozing stages we will be interested into it. The character explaining it all to the camera did it for me. Didn't have fun, didn't bring me anything new. I really ask you to rent it if you are in a HUGE crave of fun, and all other options are exhausted. Watch 'The Usual Suspects' instead. A lot more mature.",2,5,11,19 November 2007
Catch Me If You Can," Too much Edulcorant, Mr. Spielberg
","I saw the movie twice, and the first one dazzled me with a premise that basically is a constant run and some fun in coning. Di Caprio is outgoing and charming. Everyone else is like publicity, you know it's there but you don't take them in account. Except Christopher Walken, who is Superb.At second viewing, three years later, I remembered only pieces, and was bored to death. The settings are urban boring and the action is heterogeneous but unimpressive. I think Spielberg rooted to make the story of the con man too sweet, to make him infantile and reachable phsycologically. I didn't like that approach being the character in real life a lot more interesting, obscure and harder. Tom Hanks character Hanratty tries to be smart at all times, guessing and boring, tires with his pseudo-hero role.All of the movie tries to make what would be an interesting, edgy film into a bedtime story, sweetened by all filmical elements (actings, directing, lights, script). Im sure you will like it, because you want a smile on your face. But I sure do enjoy stories like these being much darker, much more intrinsically approached and a lot deeper. A nice try though, Spielberg. Im still a big fan of you.",6,1,7,12 November 2007
Finding Neverland," Release your Inner Child
","Marc Froster was the right man for the job. In-depth look at James Barrie is moving and accurate, bringing him back to life with a youthful, charming Johnny Depp. The study of the writer makes his person interesting in the process and never looses the conductive string.The movie is filled with emotional tones and scenes, some too over the top, but the most of them clearly focused. For the ones that are sensible on movie watching, load yourself on tissues. The movie reveals a world which was relentless, conspicuous, close minded. The character of Barrie is a delight and one will fall in love with this child in a grown up body.The art direction revives the Victorian era, with great architectural designs and a beautiful matrix of wardrobes and clothing. The story is emotional and passionate top notch.Don't believe in fairy tales, it's fine. But release your inner child and see this movie, this poem. A great movie that accomplished its goals. A delight.",8,2,2,19 November 2007
Training Day," How to Enter the Hampa
","Antoine Fuqua does an excellent job. With the big screen as an excuse, he imposes his dark, sinister view on the hampa of the Los Angeles police.Corruption is the main, but that is the work of Alonzo Harris, a great neo-villain, that doesn't value life and has understood it as a grim, violent place and has moderated himself to it. Denzel Washington is superb, mean looks, nasty bad reactions seeming so natural, I cannot believe he isn't a real filthy cop! Ethan Hawke's character is somehow naive, doesn't know what really is going all and cannot adjust to the rhythm Alonzo is accustomed to. Alonzo sets the rhythm, as a matter of fact, so we just ground for Jake (E.Hawke) to survive his rough trip.'Training Day' is rough, a good movie that counted on the budget to tell a raw story, with a great cast and some neat narrative skills. Its a bitching' movie, you should watch it.",8,0,1,23 November 2007
In Bruges," A Breath of Fresh Air: Review from Sundance
","For those who might not know the name, director Martin McDonagh is an Irish playwright who won the Oscar last year for his short film 'Six Shooter' about a chance encounter on a train, and that film's star Brendan Gleeson has returned as Ken, one of two hit men sent to the medieval city of Bruges in Belgium along with his partner Ray (Colin Farrell) to rest and lay low after a hit gone horribly wrong. Ray is a miserable bastard who makes it clear he's not happy about being in Bruges, but Ken convinces him that their boss Harry has a job for them there, as well as allowing them a chance for some sightseeing, none of which improves Ray's mood. Things look up when he meets the beautiful local woman Chloe, played by French actress Clémence Poésy--you may remember her as Fleur Delacore in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire--and scores himself a date, which also goes horribly wrong due to Ray shooting off his big mouth. From there things continue to go south as Ray and Ken get into all sorts of messes and meet strange characters, all of whom will play a part in the larger picture.There aren't too many non-Belgian films set in Belgium, and Bruges is a beautiful but odd place to set an entire movie. You'll probably learn more about the place than you ever need to know as Ken narrates their sightseeing excursions with a few factoids about the place. The entire first act is driven by the chemistry between Farrell and Gleason as they deliver rapid-fire patter that reminds one of McDonagh's background as a playwright, but it makes them as immediately endearing as Vincent and Jules in 'Pulp Fiction,' allowing for an even bigger impact as things happen to them. Our first encounter with the boys' boss Harry is an expletive filled telegraph and an equally amusing phone conversation with Ken, making it obvious that this is a mobster cut from the same cloth as Ben Kingsley's Don Logan. Those who don't recognize the voice will be thrilled when they learn who plays Harry, because it's a pleasant surprise.This is easily Colin Farrell's best role and performance in a long time, one that allows him to show a lot of range, not just as the big-mouthed prat we assume Ray to be, but also as a thoughtful man distraught about what happened in London. Having seen the error of his ways, he feels the need to make right, even if he hides it with a lot of complaining and arguments, and that carries over to Gleason's Ken, continuing his great run with McDonagh.McDonagh has created a clever script that interweaves its small cast of characters into an intricate crime caper that mixes humor, violence and true heartfelt human emotions into a brilliant debut feature. Just when you think you know where things are going, McDonagh throws a sharp curve ball at you and then another, and another, and pretty soon, what started as a two-handed talkie has turned into a hold-your-breath action flick, when Harry turns up in Bruges to rectify some business that Ken has botched. Even so, it never loses what made the first half so charming and entertaining, because McDonagh's impressive dialogue remains at the forefront for the extended confrontation between Ken and Harry. The ending might be somewhat grim for some tastes going by the lightness of what's gone before, but the way everything is tied together makes it all worth it.Anyone worried that Tarantino and Ritchie's best work might be behind them, can revel in the promise of McDonagh's take on the crime-comedy genre, as this talented filmmaker shows that 'Six Shooter' was no fluke and this movie begins what's likely to be a long and promising film career. On top of that, if 'In Bruges' doesn't end up being the funniest and most quotable movies of the year, then it should be very close",9,520,614,23 January 2008
Se7en," Dark Human Nature
","What is the most simple way to present the Human's dark side? The answer is by sins: Sins that from the Fifth Century announce Man's most awful deviations from God.This movie isn't catholic yet, nor does it have an approach: it's impressively dark and violently grim. From the first start, the characters are presented surrounded by a whispering, sad rain. The mood is also set with dampened colors and grayish tones. Nobody ever smiles in the film, they laugh for few seconds when united in a dinner. But throughout the story, Detective Mills (Pitt) and Detective Somerset (Freeman) will set up on a case that is horrendous and enigmatic: a serial killer roams the city with the Capital Sins as basis to create his assassinations. He preaches, according to Somerset. Mills isn't accustomed to the following Odyssey, he is yet not aware of the fatal obscurity of the Human Mind. Somerset is about to retire, and he knows what he deals with his job, Morgan Freeman with his tired eyes show you everything the character has seen among his trail.As the play is opened; the killer behind the murders shows to be analytical and intelligent and he isn't afraid of people chasing him: he just introduces him to his ultimate 'work'. He plays with them. He presents a puzzle for them to solve as he is in total control. Kevin Spacey will surprise everyone with his psychotic demeanor and his empty gestures, showing spiritual deprivation.'Se7en' is likely not for everyone. It is intended to expose the Dark, Twisted side of mankind, engulfed by a series of morbidly well thought murders. Actings are stupendous, all variating from a negative panoply: depicting Sadness, Anger, Worry superbly. Nothing is cheerful, nothing is lightning and warming. The movie shows you perfectly what man is all about on their obscure range. It is shattering, it is demanding. But it is one of the most excellent experiences on nowadays cinema.",10,3,4,30 November 2007
The Big Lebowski," 'This Aggression will not Stand Man'
","I had been wanting to see 'The Big Lebowski' for a long time, until I got a clean copy from it in the Blockbuster.Even though the film is superbly managed into the deep terrains of black comedy, satire and portraying the ultimate 'exaggereta' model of the lazy American, slaking in his filthy environment; it's a repeated exercise in form, and it uses it's style too often to provoke a sense of depletion, excess and tiresomeness.Even that, Jeff Bridges does a brilliant performance (snubed by the Academy because of the fact of being a comedy role) and hilarious sidekicks like a temperamental John Goodman and a Latino stylish bowler like John Turturro.'The Big Lebowski' is a good comedy, with a slick, smart script, recommended for the audiences that do not target comedies in a mass-like way and enjoy acid and dark moments and laughing out loud, man.",9,4,8,29 September 2008
Citizen Kane," The Life of A Man: A ShortTake
","Please let me give you one short critic: -'Citizen Kane' is old, but is needed. It's breakthrough over technical implementations made it classic and a milestone. Overall, it's not fun as we are accustomed in the Hollywood way. It narrates the life of a man, in the view of others, while searching his ultimate secret lying on his last word: 'Rosebud'. Movies usually involve people in front of a conflict, solving it, learning the lesson. 'Citizen Kane' is an racconto of a life, it's a progression of lessons and conflicts.'Citizen Kane' lasts so long because it's story vents every story of man; not in the content, but in the manner of being told. Every man has his story, every man and women will lye on their bed before dying and try to remember her life by one image, one word, one feeling, one movie. Although Charles Foster Kane, the Citizen, (a memorable Orson Wells) has wealth, a lovely wife and power, he cannot buy what he misses most and he falters over the memory of his most (and everyone's) precious moment: childhood, where every story begins; and where we want to go when it ends. The innocence that is sacred, irremovable. The beginning of every story.",9,2,4,13 December 2007
Dawn of the Dead," Zombie Extreme with a New Touch
","Zombies. The genre of zombies when being A class is a delight on suspense. With this movie, set upon current times, delimiters a narrow, smart premise that makes you wonder what would you do in such situation of devastation and terror, where would you go, it immediately grips you and holds you praising for the survival of the 'not zombies'.The gruesome but excellent make-up sets a standard of classy directing and the story does focus on another sight: the survivors. I think its nice to see how the human stories develop in such a tremendous and scary context. However, this is not it. Do not be fooled. You will find zombies, tense situations, and funny situations as well. Its a great movie for the cult, a nasty good addition.",8,3,5,5 November 2007
Green Room," Nazies are kinda bad people
","What starts like a tension filled plot driven thriller, located in a very small space and with a secluded cast, turns into a campy slasher type film where killers pursue and heros try to run. It begins to devour cliches from movies of the genre (expect the dog, the dog was a good touch) including the very classic 'the hero turns as bad as the villains'.The real deal of the movie (besides the toxic, opressive atmosphere) is Patrick Stewart, because he plays a rock and roll germanophile negative nazi leader, and also wears a sweet hat.",5,0,4,10 February 2018
The Secret in Their Eyes," Speaking Eyes
","'El Secreto de sus Ojos' hit me with unspeakable strength. I didn't expect to like it so much, so I owe a review to those in analysis measures before seeing it or those interested in some opinion.First off, Campanella works with flawless effort all of the technical aspects of the film. It even starts with a double exposure effect, mixed with some sad shots of a beautiful Buenos Aires that hints the spectacle ahead of us. One shot especially, from a chopper in a soccer field edited with a crane shot is breathtaking. Nothing to envy from Hollywood upper class.But the main strength of the movie comes from the powerful narrative dominion Director Campanella has over characters, spaces and silences. Many moments are coldly tense, scary and very, very intense. This crossover from genres by Campanella couldn't have been better. Crime stories often fall in common places, this one relies on the fragile psychological state of the audience to draw all of it's intense dialog, acting and scenes.I cannot stop recommending it, Argentina can open it's market with movies such as this. It has many, many memorable moments, it interwines comedy perfectly and it is doubtful you will instantly forget it, as it is so well constructed. See it if you can!",8,473,515,19 August 2009
Alexander," Poisoning the Legend
","Oliver Stone is a guy with chubby hands, and a sure lot of strength. That's what I imagine when seeing his movies: he is everything but delicate, and when he gets his hands on projects he squashes the narrative like porcelain.Sometimes he does it right (Platoon, JFK).But Stone is slapping Alexander the Great's myth on here. Instead of going to portray a leader, a strong man, a conqueror he makes Collin Farrel (who's not ready for a role that big) whining and whimpering like a sensible homo. It's great to show the Human Side on every figure; but Stone went for a myth, for rumors. Alexander was bisexual and half the movie he flirts with companion Jared Leto.What a chance to ruin a legend. Then cast a ridiculous make up team, in which the passing of time means nothing to them. Combine battle scenes with a dreadful music, like torturing chellos. Cast also some extras that will laugh during the movie, and make Alexander go for corny, lengthy speeches with no final message but to fill the movie. Let it be 3 hours.Im giving this movie a 1 because of what It could have been. I was bored, I was historically shocked. I hate being part of the mass, but just give Stone his retirement package.",1,5,7,16 January 2008
Hot Fuzz," Not as Hot as I Thought
","'Hot Fuzz' triumphs over it's structural shape: a simple and daring parody over today's Blockbusters and over the top action flicks. The triple army formed by Wright directing and Frost and Pegg in the acting couple led to a sensational Shaun of the Dead, product of a smart, poignant sense of humor. Maybe I was wrongly advised as this movie is shaded on it's humorous side by the policial- crime story told. A crime movie inflates the brain and doubles the attention rate and lateral thought, things that a comedy doesn't require.This bizarre mix comes into mysterious crimes, multiple twists and shootings in a Dream City with a powerful and vivid image. It's funny moments are not few, many of them very good and 'laugh out loud' hilarious, but its paradoxical relationship between genres doesn't end closing. It's a non-stop mix between relax and pay complete focus. It's not a mix of genres, but of intentions.Besides that, HF has plenty of technical games, like a fast, modern editing and union of scenes with double meaning and plenty of innuendos. This movie is very smart, that's for sure, but maybe comparing it to Shaun of the Dead I can say they have lowered one step of the ladder and gone into a completely different one.",5,1,3,17 January 2008
The Others," A strong plate
","Everything is spoken in whispers. The atmosphere, music in crescendo at all times, mixes a continuous fog; and the lonely panorama of an antique house. One has to be prepared to fight a phsycological war against the movie: not only because one expects a shock at each time the music reaches a climax, but because one is faced ideologically with a tremendously upsetting and desolating point of view of death. Nicole Kidman's delivers true fear to the audience, and the empty spaces on the dreaded house and suspenseful innuendos will paralyze your back hairs. The twist, marvelous twist, will leave everyone gasping. If you say you'd expected it, thats because you weren't INTO the movie but reasoning apart. Be ready. Ones heart will flutter, the interesting premise will keep you seated. Its a damn fine movie, an edgy thriller.",8,6,8,1 November 2007
Match Point," Least Personal Allen Plays Smart
","Woody Allen has defined a genre that might well suit the writer's catharsis, a little bit more outrageous with Charlie Kauffman, in which characters digress into their feelings and avoid all kind of physical action. Woody used to depict in scene his alter ego to structure and open all what he has in mind in more than an intellectual recipe. Cinematographically in his sunset (or not so) he shines a smart, well crafted story about an ex-tennis player that is involved in the London elite as well in trouble and dead ends.His film may pass reliably as a true story, filmed in the moment as things are factual and the filming is just a witnessing in the story. He plays fairly well with that perspective: he makes it credible thanks to great, felt performances and a script that makes it's way through rigorous drafting to look natural and improvised. Allen here has the time to impose succulent in betweens and innuendos, fantastic metaphors and intelligent, thoughtful ramifications of the human condition. His cinematography is slow moving, yet smooth, just like drinking wine. Elitesque and superb. There is fire between the young couple of mains, where Woody tries to stay fresh no matter the years. 'Match Point' is Woody's most commercial film, and he defined him as his best. He may be proud all over his meditated script and his first rate direction, but maybe audience (us) will prefer his innovated, spicy and emotional older pictures.",6,3,3,27 November 2007
The Prestige," To Live the Third Act
","'The Prestige' will keep you guessing what's coming next. It's one of those movies you just want to know the answer straight away but still beg for more clues. It's exciting, twisted, smart and well written. See it.In the world of illusion, Borden and Angier will become enemies after one of their tricks goes incredibly wrong. Their rivalry will go past any limit, reaching further to accomplish the best trick and reveal all of their enemy's secret. Thanks to Christian Bale, and Hugh Jackman, the basic duel that is drawn throughout the film is stunningly acted and enigmatic, with classy gestures and smooth performance of dialogs. Christopher Nolan revives the era with delicious decorations and use of dampened tones, which gives the film an intense and pushy aura. The rivals are primarily interested in the 'living' on the act, where the best trick is to deceive the audience into inflicting doubts to them and carrying them away from the truth.Michael's Caine character (who does a great role also) states that the magic is formed by three parts: the turn, which presents ordinary things to attract the audience, the pledge to transform this into something extraordinary and the prestige; the most important act, to blow them away.It's end is clever and has many levels to understand it. It will all fall as a puzzle. The film, as it should, shields a fantastic Prestige. A turn of the table that will leave you gasping and clapping.Watch it, it's a nice puzzle to watch being solved. Just let the magic flow.",9,4,7,20 November 2007
Crash," Import & Export of Hypocrisy
","'Crash' is good on one side and bad on the other. The script and the script. One part delivers great moments and lines but there comes the erasing of all true and original ideology in this kind of movies. Stereotypes. Crash is very pale, weak in presenting the characters. None is a hero, none really redeems itself, all are crayon daft attempts of interesting characters that go nowhere but near the common place and repeated racism. Sugar sweet racism, no real hard based hate. This is what Hollywood believes happens in the streets.The choral story fails in presenting too many stories in too little time and making a sudden, unprepared joining knot. The stories aren't truly related. It appears they are; but if you think it over it's just a first Good impression. This movie gets worse when you think it over in your head.Stereotypes, cheap shots, easy, cheap feelings. The bad side. Some good performances, good scenes, the bright one. This movie is average, far far away from grand. The Academy prized this over Brockeback Mountain? They were seduced by the first impression only.",4,3,8,14 November 2007
The Beach," Exploring Below
","Often movies are about one character among a problem, and resolving it. Often they make a travel to solve the problem, story develops all surrounding the problem or obstacle.'The Beach' has the quality of not being of a story, but more like a quest. It is about a group of youngsters fleeing from a frenzy society to form one of their own, and is good material leading to a profound narration, and Boyle uses his knowledge over the sublimation of messages and subtleties to accomplish it's goal: Society at it's most crude form develops, over a study of spatial behavior and human mentality, leadership and a poignant portrait of the Society's hierarchy and it's components.This film is not conventional. It's about a form of discovery, when in the beach, a calm beach; we stay in contact with Nature and rediscover our most basic needs and desires. Boyle straps every character into the magnifying glass and delivers an unorthodox masterpiece.",6,0,0,17 January 2008
Pan's Labyrinth," The Making of a Poem
","'El laberinto del Fauno' is a poem. Delightful and frightening. The whispering woods, home to what will be an awful scenario of war, almost speak. They blow magically and enigmatically. The camera plays all the time, presenting the story in a smooth way, artistic and contemplative. The toying around with the focus makes the impression of a vivid experience, like we are really present in the story.The script is delicious; mixing two stories in one. The story of a war liberated in times of the decade on 1940, with the fascist army of Franco liberating a war against the rebels in the mountains. The other story centers on Ofelia, a girl whose mother engages with a cold-blooded, soul-less Captain Vidal that with the facility that he polishes clean his boots, fits his impeccable uniform and shaves with unsullied effort he can kill a man with no second thoughts, or torture a youngster with the same feeling. Sergi Lopez confers the character an incredible interpretation, with freezing looks and inhumane gestures.Ivana Baquero as young Ofelia does a flawless performance. The cast is superb, imposing realism over melodramatic attempts. Guillermo del Toro does a poetry work, something off the books of Hollywood with a fresh, innovative story.The greatest aspect of this film goes to the visuals. A stunning make-up that brings to life mythological creatures and a faultless art direction that with a small naive appearance imposes the world a breathtaking look. The contrast with the war freed upon the mountains makes this aspect a lot better. The managing to keep both of this worlds apart but innocently inter-related makes the experience breathtaking.This movie is a beautiful poem, written and directed in a mature and royal way. It may have a brutal imagine catalog but it's worth all the way. Keep it in Spanish to admire the softness of the language.Please watch this film, it's fierce good.",10,5,11,6 January 2008
The Polar Express," A Foggy Christmas
","'The Polar Express' isn't a regular animation movie. That said, do not take your kids under eight years old. Robert Zemeckis inspired a darker trip into the night of Christmas, more mystical and zen.The graphics are interesting, different. With the motion capture animation it continues giving the film an eerie atmosphere. There is a crashing feeling of loneliness and obscurity throughout the film. It's very interesting to see at night; and be consumed by the excellent atmosphere. I have rare goosebumps at watching this movie, it's potent and envelops the viewer to its dark atmosphere. The technical details are fabulous, the message is rather bleak. But I'll say it's marvelously told and composed.It's not ordinary. 'Polar Express' hinders on not falling in common places, and exposing messages of inner child composition to make the movie worthwhile.It's a relevant trip, dare buy the ticket and take it.",8,3,5,20 November 2007
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Renting Billboards to Bust Balls
","What is so good about '3 billboards..:' you may ask?I really don't know. It does have some whacky Coen-esque characters, some people shouting non sequiturs, dwarves and arsonists, but nothing compared to Woody Harrelson's chin, which really is the star of the movie.If you like comedy you'll half like it. If you like serious drama you'll half like it. If you fully like it, it means you are similar to the characters in the movies: very weird. And not fully human.",5,5,10,10 February 2018
The Bourne Ultimatum," The Wolves Came Out of Their Den
","Having followed the trilogy of Bourne, I have to say I'm satisfied. Greengrass decided to open a 'cat and mice' game, where intellects are put under pressure and Bourne must challenge alone all of them who are seeking for him. The movie is in a constant run, whereas it is in cars, bikes, over the roofs of houses. Traps, set ups. We can't even start to breath when the game is on.The 'steadicam' use couldn't be more accurate. It gives a sense of company to the movie; we are always running, always present while escaping. His semi-shots, out-of screens and artful photography are details I myself enjoy pretty much.Morocco, Belgium, France, Rusia. You won't have a breath, I repeat. The film doesn't stops and has great use of it's elements, and it's nice to see how the wolves operate on their constant hunt, with their intelligence edge, superior technology and fearful bureaucracy. It delivers with a high sense of realism.This is a movie of intelligence, thrilling essence and utter energy.",7,1,1,10 January 2008
The Aviator," Dedicated and Colourful, didn't move me an inch
","Scorcese was, until the creation of 'The Departed', the black sheep of the Oscars. In 'The Aviator', Scorcese delivers an outstanding carnival of eccentric clothings, fresh visual tones, and sly filmography scenes. Seeing the movie, one utterly is deviated into the majestic scenario of powerful dresses, settings, decorations that the focus on Howard Hughes is sometimes lost. Di Caprio applies fabulously to his work, so does Cate Blanchett and Alan Alda. There is a gigantic cast; which will fascinate you with the presence of stars. The luxury and excess of the movie is the contrast that sharpens the grey and unmoving story of Hughes. We like his story, we understand his fall but it doesn't emotionally move us. Scorcese has derogated into a path of visual content and left aside unpolished the strength of what meant to be a great biopic.",7,2,5,4 November 2007
Léon: The Professional," 'Death is...Whimsical Today'
","Luc Besson shows how he can create a wonderful story again, and also a wonderful movie. To start with, the relationship of Leon, a hardcore hit-man that talks to plants and doesn't relate at all to the world, and Mathilda, a girl that is moved away from her family nucleus to find real love, a paternal figure on Leon. Both Jean Reno and Nathalie Portman seem born to this role, so natural. They feed a bizarre, uncommon couple that lights on their talents and their lateral chemistry. Gary Oldman is a beast, in every single way. He enjoys performing a DEA agent that has very little respect for everything. When he shouts 'Bring me EVERYOOONEEE!', one can see that his acting is intense, visceral and passionate.Leon is an excellent story, any way you see it. The script makes us jump into a two side story: an action packed ride and an emotional, story that has never talked so brilliantly about love (but not luscious love).See it, its a basic film. I'll give you a nice line to throw you in. 'Death is, Whimsical Today'",10,4,8,12 November 2007
Burn After Reading," We Laugh, at You, In Our Thrones.
","If this movie wasn't directed by the fine eye of the Coens, one would qualify it as a stupid movie by stupid people. Yet the Coens have showcased their comical range, from 'The Big Lebowski' to 'Intolerable Cruelty' and with 'Burn After Reading' they choose to a silent wink into audiences of humor movies of today.In the film, people know that a disk of the CIA should be important, should bring money, but they cannot fathom to understand how or where to use it. They are scabbards of a society that teaches what is good and bad without explaining. Thus, we are converted into stupid people with stupid plans. The laughing parts are dry, mainly because of the lack of empathy to the common viewer, but this is what creates it's unique style: not to laugh at them, but to laugh at ourselves, and our suppressed modern Neanderthal.",8,1,2,7 December 2008
The Shining," The Mind Plays Us Nasty Games
","Jack Nicholson seems like he was born for roles like these. His face will immediately tell you that the character is mad, but he is mad as well. It explains us so convincingly the performance. He is quite mad to play so good as such, said Martin Landau.Besides Jack Nicholson riveting, unworldly acting that transposes madness slowly in the most subtle, cleverly professional way I've ever seen, the movie is the Grandfather of suspense films. Technically, it innovates on the standard of the 'backwards camera' that makes you feel that you are actually in the scene, following the characters in their solitude like we were omnipotent watchers. But we are just witnesses in the upcoming Odyssey.The setting is a vast, isolated hotel that is settled on the snowed valley of Colorado. We can almost feel our skin wrinkle, our hair freeze. The atmosphere is cold, giving a great sense of loneliness. The snow will act as a curtain of natural power that will cover the scene from others and seclude them from the outer world.The movie's pace is fantastic, while you long for some heart braking scary moments, you will find that the movie will twist your mind not ultimately with the supernatural but with the deviation of the Human psyche on the film. It's men who you have to fear, mostly.Did I feel the change on Jack Torrance's mind. The transformation is bitching, moving us restless while introducing us in the most hideous basement of the human Mind.'The Shining' will not disappoint you, Im sure. It's tricky all over, and will manipulate you with fear, suspense and at the same time, will hold you tight to the chair sensing that in any moment you will get a heart attack. But trust me, your heart won't get an attack. Your brain will.",10,1,2,23 November 2007
Face_Off," Action at Another Level
","John Woo normally avoids profoundity and exercising the brain with his films. Yet with 'Face/Off' I found his best film and his most deep and intelligent one! Seems that identity crisis is a must, where Cage and Travolta (classic good and evil clash) switch their faces in a constant hunt between them, one to avenge his early son's death and the other to suppress his chaser, to profit on his schemes without being followed.Both Cage and Travolta are surprising, although both of them play great the part of being Castor Troy. But wait, are u asking me exteriorly or interiorly? Isn't Cage Travolta and the other way? Well, Face/Off requires your patience and holding to the movie's plot. Miss a second, miss the movie. Besides having a fantastic, well thought script, John Woo misses not his straight roots and delivers great shooting scenes, gripping chase scenes and delivers a sense of tension and impotence for wanting to tell everyone in the movie the truth and how real things go.The scene where both of them are only separated from a mirror is paradoxical, yet enormously symbolic and perfect for the movie. Watch it!",8,2,4,27 November 2007
Jarhead," A Portrait of the War Inside
","Sam Mendes approach at the war in Iraq isn't rancid neither inaccurate. It's lateral. Wheter you expect tons of action or tons of emotions, you will get in between of them. The movie explores the lack of dynamism in the Eastern Front and how the war is liberated by the Phsycological road and the manipulation of fears is of upper relevance.Performances are visceral and passionate, smart and felt. Jake Gylleenhall does his work in a bloody good manner. Saarsgad brings the spiritual contrast into scene with a cynicism that is largely well acted. Jamie Foxx brings to scene a life style that dominates the front: a life style in which vital is the adrenaline and no matter how much sand, oil or walking in an empty desert may despair, he goes front to his patriotic spirit, with his wit and grown loyalty to his team.The movie revolves into the idea of what happens between the recruits when there is no action and one has to always be prepared. What goes on when nothing goes on? In a place that violent and filled of turmoil, the tension appears as fast as it vanishes. The tension is dealt in the mind, with the well drawn characters fight together with the common fear: War, Death.A good movie, that approaches war at a different angle. I took a good surprise at seeing it. 'We are the hammer of God and that hammer is falling down'",7,2,3,19 November 2007
Collateral," The Vampire Nights
","I cannot recall of a movie that made me so comfortable at seeing. The dark spaces; reminds me of a trepidant nostalgia where you can plot yourself walking in those defficiently lit and cold pathways. Mann, you are a goddam vampire! You travel night as If we were company! Tom Cruise: your last big role. Enjoy it, old men. You'll never get so profound into a role in the rest of your career. Jamie Foxx, what can I say? You emotional birch! You do have a talent; I really empathized with your situation. Script: Well, you are finely crafted. There are no wasted lines and the action doesn't repeat itself. As I say, this movie makes you feel very comfortable; making you want to walk at night or to enjoy the full moon in the sleeping city. The 'noir' atmospheres are so electric, they will jump right to your setting. Trust me, it's a flawless option.",10,3,4,1 November 2007
Ratatouille," Pixar's More Mature Tale: A Charming Travel for Identity
","'Ratatouille' is Pixar's most intelligent, mature and delicate work of all it's way and experience. I had a laughing time with Nemo, I particularly didn't enjoy the Incredibles, but with Ratatouille Pixar reached new heights. Animation for adults, hidden in a package for kids.¿Why would you explain love scenes, a cook that was in jail, a cook that ran away from home, a cook that is a gambler? Because adults can enjoy its subtleties and innuendos as kids enjoy the plain and open jokes. Besides the beautiful, vivid voice work, there is an excellent approach to food as art, food as passion. We enjoy movies, some enjoy video games, Remy enjoys food as an art, passion and identity, with different smells, countries and tastes. But the fact that a rat, filthy creature, enjoys this, makes the movie an interesting tale.This karma of humanizing every little bit of what's inhuman gives a blatant irony: humans in the film are caricaturesque and are the less developed of all. The positivism of the film, the life they give to the characters is just one part of the story. Graphics excel in the movie: the fact that we want to taste that crumbly, hot bread or eat that elite Roquefort and cherries is impressive, going from the adjusted human expressions to the dynamic of the film, how people move and act.'Ratatouille' is a nice, charming tale. With superior graphics and voices, and a nice message we can say that if Pixar continues this path, things are going to be very different in the Animation Industry and we adults can take our kids to the movies and be so excited like them as well.",5,4,8,19 December 2007
Control," Slight Justice to a Mighty Figure
","You'll see, Im a huge fan of New Order. And by consideration I learned some things about Joy Division, the group that led to New Order. Joy Division was led by Ian Curtis, a young singer with an integral soul, a poet, who sang stories of alienation, loneliness and devastation. He was a poet in the wrong bounds. His life was truly interesting. Just read the delicious songs of him and learn what lied behind him.But what have we got here? I believe that if you presented me this movie bluntly, without saying the word 'Joy Division', I would have not seen Ian Curtis in the film, just another biopic of a forgotten musician. The essence of the derailing, the soul that cannot keep with it's underling pressures and it's final blend: fame, drugs, and sensibility is not presented in an emotional, understandable way. Yes, sensibility. Ian Curtis was a sensible man; and the movie does a light, poetical justice to him. 'Love Will Tear Us Apart' is a fine example of his insightful and paradoxical sovereignty over his feelings, that later would collapse.First of all, black and white panoply unnecessary, as if the distraction for colors was utterly needed. It gives the film a pseudo-intellectual look , something that was disposable. Later, some theatrical, elaborated scenes took away from the film the simplicity I expected. Then Samantha Morton, Ian's wife. I don't see a character, a persona: I see a 35 year old actress dressed as a youngster. Maybe that's my own problem, but I can't get over her empty looks. The essence of Ian Curtis is somewhat inconsistent, making me feel uneven. Sam Riley does a nice interpretation, just nice. His demeanor and expressions wave me some despair, but not as in solitude, as in awkwardness. Some scenes jump to fast to their conclusion, without their valued insight: they marry too fast, they get into the band too fast. He lived to fast yes, but I guess that's no excuse.I felt the movie entirely as if they did just a basic research over Curtis. Maybe I feel a blinding passion for his work and life that prohibits me to see further onto the movie's terms. You will like it, I believe. But Im explaining this as a review over Ian Curtis' life, over Joy Division, that I felt I ought over my consideration for him.Anton Corbijin may be a good photographer, and he uses his working tricks to disguise this into an artsy film. Why is it that every biopic that comes out has to be deep, intelligent and the main has to get great credits? Im standing against 'Control' to say this: -Could have been way better.",6,4,6,19 January 2008
Spirited Away," 'Alicia in Wonderland', a little more Mystical and Japanese
","Imagine 'Alicia in Wonderland'. Take the color and the childish, funny, motivated characters. Replace them by internal conflicts, by mystery and evil, and magic. It is a trip, which draws your attention into an examination of onirical places beautifully colored by the master hand of Hayao Miyazaki. Chihiro is a mind trip, with amazing scenes and comfortable drawings. The story exhumes a soft music, the characters a human delight. Compare the Witch Yubbaba to the Alicia's clowny Queen of the Cards, then you can have a clue of the profoundity this movie breaths. A little bit with many innuendos and cut messages; Japanese films have much to teach us. Sayonara Chihiro, we learned.",10,1,3,18 November 2007
Alien vs. Predator," Nothing Actually Matters
","Two scary aliens, two fierce looking creatures, myths of the great cinema extended by Cameron and Scott are now destroyed, converted into forth-going idiots with no logic that fight with no reason. The plot, empty as my head while seeing this, didn't allow me to thrill in. The actings, less than less. The cast, a tribute to shortage of budget.Its not even recommended to see it even to have fun. You won't. There is no actual entrance to see the movie as good. Its pale, frigid, boring, a carnival of fights between big monsters that tear their guts and slash green jelly like blood out of each other. Its not even worth it, Im trying to warn the reader of this critic to avoid this film at all costs! Or if you already saw it, to accompany him/her with their grief.",2,12,24,2 November 2007
No Country for Old Men," A Sea full of Sand
","Latest work from the Coen works as expected, or a little less. As much as you can hope on deep interiorizing, the most explored characters are the ultimately classical versus between Good and Evil. Bardem personifies Anton Chigurh, a man with no hints of humanity that kills because it's convenient and because he can. He never smiles, he talks clearly and with a profound, steady voice. He is the unrelenting evil Coen's want to explore.Although the premise follows Llewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin) and his escape from Chigur's deadly hands, Brolin must not take that big of applause, neither big protagonism. His acting is hard, unrevealing. Instead, Tommy Lee Jones is textured as a sheriff that avoids violence, in a town where only dust and cactus gather. But his deep, extremely deep sensation of disturbia, nearly death and sense of duty is worth the ticket.Within it's minimalistic reach, no soundtrack, long determined pauses, 'No Country...' accomplishes. It's a studied character piece, that I believe will be overgrown by oblivion within the pass of times; as it's popularity is within being unconventional, slow and impervious to common places.",9,4,7,15 February 2008
Batman Begins," Mighty Good, but not God
","I really appreciate the fact that Batman turns out to be the indifferent guy who is picking his suit at the store, having dinner at a restaurant with her girlfriend and the one who cries in lonely nights for the traumas of his childhood. Christopher Nolan took the movie at the correct time, when much of us were waiting for the return of The Dark Savior, whose dark suit hides a thirst for justice that lies in a humanly more developed way; not like Schumacher's Batman that was almost Captain America with a little more colour. Great Christian Bale: his gestures show power, his words resentment: best Batman although he had no big competition. The supporting cast shines for itself; but Katie Holmes really lacks appealing actoral power. The cinematography which catches dark at its very best, and the incredible sound make this a very pleasant experience.Fast and moving editing. Okay with that, but I have another couple of movies that outsmart this. Apart from it, very good choice.",8,2,2,1 November 2007
Before Sunset," Long Love Chats on the Sena River
","'Before Sunset' is a very personal movie. Starting from there, you won't expect cheesy dialogs, nor action scenes but sincere conversations in the zenit of the beautiful Paris and discover how Love can be utterly talked and not physically demonstrated. That is basically it: Love is talked and debated to its best. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delply are helped by their sound chemistry and a perfect use of their hidden emotions to show profound love.A very spontaneous script is softly produced as we travel over the charming settings on the french Riviera. This movie is recommended for quiet, peaceful moments in couples. The lack of dynamics and the somewhat little change of scenario make it dense, but there's no issue if you fell in love hearing the honest dialogs.If you are a romantic person; then this movie is for you.",8,0,1,4 November 2007
Revolutionary Road," Far from Heaven and Far From Hell
","Since the quiet triumph of Haynes' 'Far from Heaven' among the most delicate critic circles films have been trying to recompose the elegant justice of Sirk's urban dramas proper from the 50's. Revolutionary Road is a clean, obvious attempt at that.From the ornate composition of interiors to the double-standard acting myriad everything is a blatant attempt to reconstruct the epoca of the 1950 and the movies characteristics of it. The wrong turn is taken with the unattractive story, the common and stamped characters and the very weak development. Di Caprio, though, is phenomenal. On my part, Winslet was overly dramatic and boring.Decide yourself, the movie relies on the objective of being a time machine, a reconstruction, but it's not worth an instant viewing.",4,0,1,15 May 2009
The Mist," Mist, Haze, Fog...Watch out for Humans Better.
","What to say about 'The Mist'? It pretty much overwhelmed me. Yes, for its truly oppressive finale and it's tension moments. With disaster movies like these the script is divided somewhat into: 1) Society is shown functioning 2) Abnormal events presented 3) Society analyzes the situation 4) Society panics 5) Chaos.Well, I repeat the word 'Society' because of one thing. At one point, after the mysterious mist proclaims the entire city, some people are cornered into a supermarket. And there Frank Darabont plays an intense, insightful drawing of the human group, that it's powerfully engaging and smartly written. The voices of reason, common thinking and Christianity are promptly adjusted to the characters, and as tension and problems start accumulating so does the strain between the survivors. Fear not only the monsters, but the enemy within your lair...I didn't like of the film the painfully hostile image it gives to the Christian people. It's leader, or 'vessel' in the movie is a crazy woman, fanatic that seduces the survivor gathering into her apocalyptic, biblical disoriented theories. Mass follows this leader that gives all final power to God without logical retribution, but pure devotion. The mass is powerful, and the few left on reasoning and cold logic. The mass convicted, tries to hunt the left ones and blame them for the disaster. Sounds familiar? Yes, Nazism. Maybe Im rushing. I am not Christian, but I entirely respect the religion and didn't want to be raised and convinced of a premature hate to the religion because of one annoying character and a good scripting.Stephen King wrote the book in which this movie is based. His knowledge on terror and human fear is so vast, and his control over those reading and viewing his books/films make the experience reliable. The ending, well, it's devastating. I liked the movie not only buying the intense tension, but for it's crude report on human mind, chaos and society's guidance.",5,20,40,10 December 2007
The Illusionist," Breeding the Illusion of Puzzle
","I can't really remember the last time I was so amazed by the quality and development of a movie. Not just flabbergasted, but filled with awe as the story was constructed inside a most meticulously brilliant frame.I say first meticulous because the film excels in every aspect imaginable. All of the production values contribute discreetly to give the film that taste, like inhaling deep beauty all around. Scrupulous and beautiful art direction; from the dusty lamps; to the sculpted street scenarios, to the wonderful wardrobe election, fonded on careful creation. The photography is also remarkable, let's give it the honor, of imposing a dry, sepia like tone all over and mastering the precise quantity and quality of colors to amuse the spectator and drown him into the story, helped by a cohesive, narrow editing. Neil Burgess shows his study on films, as I was interested in seeing the now rare closing on iris, used in some scenes fading the image in a black, circled vortex. That was used in the pre-50 movies. 'Some of the tricks transcend the illusion and approach art' claims Norton's character. Well, art is reached with this breathtaking production afore mentioned.Actings, on the other hand, are brutally calculated: like Giamatti's pondering ordinary charm, and Norton exuding elegance all the way on. Sewell's villain potency and Biel's charm, beauty, mesmerizing looks and so on. Oh, and I forgot! The music is sincerely spectacular, inviting the viewer to close eyes in order to truly hear it. Some ups and downs of a piano make an absolutely astonishing score that adds to the movie.If 'The Prestige' (unevitable comparison) was a dark, gritty but fantastic approach at magic 'The Illusionist' is delicious, exceptionally presented and a lot more sweet on edges, with a romantic story finely scripted. The spiritualism messages are beyond my interest, but adds to the movie's utter bright karma.I wasn't surprised like these since a long shot, since 'Spirited Away'. Maybe because I wasn't aware of the hype. But the movie will be presented as a puzzle, with many hints to solve a faltering mystery. Appearances may lie, may not lie. The true illusion lies in how deep does the viewer believe this story. Movies are an illusion, right? Fantastical, Incredible, Brutal, Mesmerizing. Can think of many more words. Please see it.",8,2,2,17 December 2007
Children of Men," Sunken by Political Insinuations
","If 'Children of Men' has got something really good, that would be the verisimilitude with which the near future is painted. The apocalyptic atmosphere, the desolated and helpless crowd and destroyed terrains, make up for a good aura on the film: the woods whisper mysteriously and the towns for refugees are grim and violent.But that's about all. The movie will start as a puzzle with many questions unanswered. As some are revealed, other questions are placed. There is a feeling of an incomplete process, of an ongoing question mark. The points that explain their constant running from the government are feeble and unconvincing, so ¿why are they running? ¿Why not go to the government? Clive Owen is ungestured as a statue, bringing no lighting features to the acting skills. Was it that the goal he was trying to reach, he fails to communicate his sentiments all the same. Michael Caine is the only bright star, shining on it's lateral role.Besides, we have to stand a far too prideful and patriotic script, making England the best and an unique power. It also is filled with political insinuations that at no point hit the viewer, nor interest him. Movies don't need that kind of subdued messages. It's attack to the immigrant policies, to the police corps is uninteresting and biased. The book is responsible yes, but they could well have cleaned that off. Who really cares about those 'hidden' critics to the system? All technical aspects are flawless. But the story is twisted and, too dynamic loosing the string to trap the viewer. Some shooting scenes are vivid, with steadicams vibrating and sound really scratching your walls. But, besides that, there is little to expect and pretty much nothing to ground for with 'Children of Men'. It's nice to have a good time, but you will see that behind that curtain of dynamite scenes and political innuendos, you are left with...nothing much. Nothing that would make the movie worth of being classical nor great, just a spur of the moment.",4,12,19,25 November 2007
Million Dollar Baby," A sour lesson
","Million Dollar Baby' is Clint's 27th film at progress in directing. His turnover from that legendary course of bravery in 'Unforgiven', is now set up in the flat; not charming arena of boxing. But did Clint Eastwood make a movie about boxing? Yes, no. Boxing is the element of desire; uniquely secondary for the movie but primordial to the character of Maggie, to improve on conditions. The lesson moves in a dimmed world, where characters are incomplete and they found in another the way to complete themselves. Eastwood shows his capacity to create credible characters; no dimensional yet dorky and cartoonish heroes. The heroes in 'Million Dollar Baby' are those we seem to know; but not entirely. The lesson is 'Nothing is beyond you', yet I find amazing how a very fine script can adjust a story of Frankie's redemption and anger by a lack of communication with his daughter. The film is a calm spectacle of everyday heroes, of great performances (Morgan Freeman with age absorbs perfection) yet a very sour taste. The ending is emotional, but can unbalance the fictional precision that was carried away. Indeed for that, another Academy Award and public award winner.",7,2,3,1 November 2007
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," As Time Goes on, I Dislike it More and More...
","I just felt to write this critic as being a true follower of Tarantino that I believe needs to be expanded. His work in 'KillBill' is somewhat intense and entertaining, but as time goes I can't help finding weak spots on 'KillBill'. I think people are trying to find a reason to admire it. Quentin is a movie lover, and this movie is his ultimate homage to his movie library of favorites. Yet I found somehow deviated of what his sense of homage is. ¿Is his tribute to Old Westerns Spaghettis and Oriental Films just a pastiche of unnecessary blood, mistaken for art, and his intended 'cool' characters lose flame as they blade swords into rambling, yet somehow interesting fights? ¿Have we granted permission to Quentin to do as he pleases with the camera? The Power we gave to Quentin led him to believe he could enjoy the Midas Touch. His handling on the filmical elements are wonderful, yet the movie lacks a message and a clear concept more than a mixed tribute. His passion overwhelmed him and audience accepts it as a work of art by a master mind. I'll grant you the latter. KillBill is pretty harmless, mostly meaningless, but altogether a load of splattered-arms and head chopping fun.",8,3,6,28 November 2007
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Golden Spirit
","I personally don't like Tim Burton as a director; and I know many people do for the same fact, because he is too weird and eccentrically boring to my taste. In this movie, he conserves a ton of his inner childish spirit and introduces us in a very colorful world, with very imaginative and astonishing scenarios that will leave you dazzled, and circus like music that will introduce you Deep into the movie's atmosphere. Johnny Depp personifies the character of Willy Wonka truly well. All of this eccentric conjunction makes you laugh and watch every single detail. The trip is magnificent, lots of fun and very alive and colorful. Watch it with family and kids; it doubles the fun.",7,0,1,4 November 2007
Big Fish," Burton's view on Burton
","Each director has his movie that would sum up as his experimental catharsis. Woody Allen and Charlie Kauffman write every single script with this allegory. With 'Big Fish', there is nothing great and difficult to understand, because it is done with a great magical, simple sense that entangles multiple interpretations: it beholds on the viewer to know what he/she will grab of the story.Many saw the form of creating a legacy. Of how a man is nothing more than his interior world, thus being the Big Fish the Big Story. Doesn't really matter whether it's true or not. Others see how to view the world and put on the charge on the warmed-heart direction. It has a panoply on light colors and cozy art direction, of likable actors and fantasy characters.All of this views are excellent. But what I see is Burton's most personal film. Yes, of course. But he admits and perseveres that he is a conflicted artist and his salvation relies on creating lies, stories that don't exist. He is a filmmaker, he lives by creating stories. Ed Bloom is Burton's hero, his unsuppressed self. All what he created, every inch of lies and fantasy he garnishes into his story, it's just a derivation of his interior oasis (may that be good or bad) and all of this movie is an intimate approach to his mind and heart. Burton is every character in the story, waiting to be heard in his most pure and dire form.'Big Fish' is Tim Burton view on Tim Burton.",8,3,4,28 November 2007
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," The Most Intrinsicate Harry Potter Movie
","And Potter Franchises loses it's magical flair. That flair that moved families to the movies to see a mildly mature spectacle, about flying wizards, magic and harmless fun.But as the actors get older, the movies get darker. And I don't mean darker as in the sense of a city at night. I mean mentally darker, like descending in the whole, dark basement of each character. Harry has less time with Hermione and Ron, it's a play of his odyssey with Voldemort, the villain, played by a bewitching Ralph Fiennes. David Yates imposes a nice direction; a wondrous score, and fine acted villains. It's not the best Harry Potter yet; but it seems it's reaching a different maturity and enters a whole new domain, one where the leading actors are no longer kids and trouble are moved by psychological leverages, and deep emotional conflicts. Harry Potter has changed...better get used to it.",7,0,0,15 December 2007
2001: A Space Odyssey," The Privilige of Becoming Human
","Among stars, the huge vacuum of space, we are minimal, we are just blurry spots questioning our existence. In space we discover our importance, and Kubrick highlights from a sequence of the dawn of men (hominids) that we are in our expressive pinnacle and can ask many questions without any real answers.This movie is not conventional: it seems superficial to talk about characters, plot, bad people or heroes. This film is more likely a search, an inner quest. There is no need to have strong explanations, because in the ignorance and inaction of mind we find the beauty that makes us human.Stanley Kubrick uses onirical production stages, disorienting cameras, psychedelic effects, brutal mix of colors.'2001' is just an answer, very mixed in its conception, but needed for those who ask constantly: -Who are we? Where are we going? Where do we come from? Or Better: What are we but a creation and production of our enlightened and conscious mind?",10,4,11,12 February 2008
Blood Diamond," Diamond Polished
","In the other side of the world conflicts arise with us being truly unaware. When one buys a diamond, it's difficult to imagine its path all along and the blood it may have been spilled for it: how much a simple thing like a diamond revolves so much around it. Thanks to this film by Edward Zwick, besides being plunged into a fabulously well told story, ones head is open wide. A story garmented by a neat love trail and a constant run on survival. The settings are divided into the marvelous, jaw-breaking African prairies and the poor, dusty villages of the African inhabitants. This great contrasts works perfectly also with the idea that there is another contrast within the world that makes the diamond and the world that buys it, the poor and the rich.This film being highly entertaining, moderately politic and classy acted; is a very good choice I'd say for everyone. The gripping tension owes an applause, because throughout the film you will be grounding further and further for any good character that is presented on you. Nasty good option.",7,0,0,7 November 2007
Inside Man," Stalemate
","Although it sets off pretty well, with Clive Owen talking straight to the camera saying he has the perfect plan to rob a bank, that he is 100 percent sure that his plan is flawless. We always see movies with bank robberies being the criminals risky and edgy, and repeating sometimes the same techniques and same lines. Well with the new optic of this film, one is excited. He planned it so precisely, so extensively he believes there is no possible flail. Well, this declaration is the only thing that the movie can claim of distinguished.Following this interesting commence, the movie will set with a boring brain fight between the chief police and the principal robber. Different 'interests' for an account of the bank set an uninteresting premise where the script just doesn't go anywhere. I repeat, it promises more than whatever it delivers. The final and the twist are somewhat good, but doesn't surprise as the story doesn't introduce us to the characters correctly and we simply don't care. It appears to be a distinguished, different, excellent film. Avoid it, because it just isn't so.",6,19,27,3 November 2007
The Fountain," Abiding after Death
","After watching Arrenofsky's head cracker, I had mixed feelings. First, it's love story was uneven, it meandered around pretentiousness, and it lacked light and colors.Then, there are the scenes in which Hugh Jackman is alone in his space bubble, forward to the Nirvana, remembering Lizzie, contemplating the stars, alone. And I figured, this is a good approach at death: having to cope alone in the afterlife, along a Tree that represents the object of the search, remembering love as he felt it. Along him, supernovas and stars collide crafted by a good graphic design.Very hard, with few moments to suck on. But those moments...",7,1,3,7 December 2008
Mystic River," Mystic Chilling, So Intense
","An instant jewel. To those that didn't see it I recommend it movingly. If you are elder, or if you enjoy smart, smooth and complex thought movies rent this one.Besides the flawless task of the cast (and flawless all the way), and enjoying the giant passion that brings forth Sean Penn, the quiet, full composition of Tim Robbins and the realism by Kevin Bacon, the movie is delightfully chilling, like sitting in a field covered on mist: just the watching of a beautiful scenario but at the same time feel a cold on the spine. I get this with mist and 'Mystic River'. A graceful, ghostly charm. That's what it gets you. A cold on the spine, wet sweat and not from terror; but from Intensity. The use of grey, dampened and humid spaces give the film a melancholic yet surreal atmosphere, where the real story is somewhat violent but incredibly intense and heartbreaking.This movie is super emotional, as I highlighted, very intense. Trust Clint Eastwood: he has an encyclopedic knowledge of movies and a poetic view on life that is plunged with a fascinating impact. Watch 'Mystic River'. It will haunt you after it's over, but in a very, very good way.",10,2,4,6 November 2007
30 Days of Night," A Boosting Addition to the Genre
","I am not a stainless fan of vampire movies, I just enjoy them when casually seeing one. I put them in the same bag that zombie flicks, so I have faith in the genre. This movie treats the story of a survivor group running away from a crew of Vampires, summoned in the darkness of an inevitable night. This optic more likely belongs to a class A Zombie, where they always run from their chasers, so expect changes.'30 days of night' follows an interesting premise, with a new perspective, that moved me to see it. In an isolated town in Alaska, which it summons into a month of darkness, inhabitants will have to fight with a bloodthirsty gang of vampires. The movie doubles your breathing rate, grips you to the seat and prepares you for the gore spectacle with previous innuendos: a music that is both eerie and attractive, like a northern wind blowing. The constant snow falling gives a ghostly appearance to the show, the dampened and subdued lights form the perfect stage for the action to develop and an appropriate, narrow fast editing. Thanks to the brutal make up and great acting, the Vampires look soul-less and real monsters, that are not moved by a logic, nor softened as Anne's Rice; but into their brutal needs of feeding like a hound of animals.Always with your blood frozen and your hairs paralyzed, the movie just keeps you guessing when you are going to get a big sudden scare. There is an extensive make up work (basic for movies like these), that make vampires scary and impervious, frightening with the way they walk, move and gesture. Would I mind having one of them at home.Remind you of the gruesome parts, where skin is torn down like play-doll, the fans and new experience seekers will be satisfied. There is a mild character development, where we only ground for few of them. '30 days of night' doesn't include a major budget. Expect what the poster and trailer promises. Tension, great action development, entertainment and:-Oh yes, there will be blood.",6,49,93,21 November 2007

But funny comedies are truly the ones that remain to the passing of time: no one will remember 'Wedding Crashers' in 10 years for its 'un-aging' script, but for its supernatural box office report. Owen Wilson is one of Hollywood's worst actor: try to think in any good role of him (or at least serious) Vince Vaughn talking fast and without mistakes? A pond in the screenwriter's continuity (if any). What is it with development of movies that the script has the same pattern everywhere? 'Supposedly' funny introduction-Light Comedy-Corny Introduction of Love Story-Conflict with moral dilemma.I didn't laugh at once, the characters are so mistaken for funny prototypes; the scenes are uncomfortable and painful. The script doesn't even exist. Nothing remembering good, warm movies or at least pseudo-intellectual like 'Matrix'. They don't have to be intellectual, but at least sharp like Shyamalan's twists, or stupidly hilarious like 'Scary Movie' I didn't like the movie, because it didn't apply to my sense of humour. Maybe if you are in a sad streak, or you have a light laugh and a nice mood, you watch this and like it with a little bit of sympathy. Try, I disliked it. Besides: who is the director? Does he even exist? Dubkin? Did he survive WWII?",4,1,2,26 November 2007
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Dracula's Lair, Adaptation not Fair
","Coppola's transcription of what I consider the best horror novel has been praised and lauded for the excessive lush and comfort spilled in it's design and production. The only highlight is how writer Hart could absorb Stoker's ramble on sexual hysteria, repression and explosion finally, in which Coppola translates into seductive movements, innuendos and deep colors. What is, indeed, as sexually inducing as sucking the blood, the life out of others? But in the development of action, the only highlight is Oldman's interpretation, cold, slow and chilling. The make-up dangles in between baroque and exaggerated. Reeves and Ryder make for a couple with no flair, nor joint or individually. All of the attention put in the design and context should have been taken into Dracula's internal conflicts, the spawn that grinds his eternal years of solitude, the fear and hate towards mankind, his reclusion, his eternal love.Besides that, they forgot the chapter of the book where peasants attack and clog Dracula's mansion, and claim for vengeance on the death of young women.Stoker's flair is sadly removed, at least much of it.",4,0,1,16 June 2008
The Reader," Exit Material.
","It had been awhile since I've been this disappointed, but I left the movie's credits profoundly disgusted. The material is not only weak, but practically void. It stands non-chalant, sourcing it's story as it has a bigger message, but the mix poured with unaesthetic, cold, unimportant flows of sex scenes that can't even pull reactions other than boredom, Winslet snugged on make up without feeling the character, delivering her speech without a change in her blank expression; with tears that seem to mechanical and looks that seem to disgusting.It has the disadvantage of also being talked in English, set upon Nazi Germany, a completely detachment between Michael Berg grown and youth, and lines and subplots too predictable to be accounted as realistic or even entertaining.Many movies were, are and will be made about the Second War World. It has lots of material: 'Letters of Iwo Jima' did beautifully in telling hell over the Japanese side. 'The Pianist' cut crude into a fight for survival keeping morals. Even 'Judgement at Nuremberg' did a perfect examination of the disgusting wheels of Nazi officers in trial.But 'The Reader' has nothing to give to this big names. It is big, it is boasted enormously, it has colours and environment, but lacks depth as rarely seen in films with this subject.",2,4,11,27 January 2010
Ray," A Ray of Light
","A lecture over the life of the tormented magician named Ray Charles. His pulses on the piano made fire music and his nostalgic voice created exciting, cool tunes. Each barrier that Ray was facing never kept him down, and he found his way all over conflicts. A real lesson. A great team of producers help recreate the era and armed with great costumes, hairs and settings one will follow Ray's story believing its true, direct filming! An icy music freezes and goosebumps the audience with clever sound editing. But, the most important part of the movie is Jamie Foxx. His acting is really superb, the most diamond polished acting ever seen. He lives his role. He is the Ray of Light.",8,1,2,4 November 2007
The Terminal," Spielberg's Wrong to Boot
","After watching this movie I sat and thought, on my personal taste, how Steven Spielberg was unfolding badly in his lasts movies: 'Catch me if you Can', 'Munich' were over the top, somehow unimportant and blurry in their conception. And I thought on his good movies, ones that made him King: 'Jaws', 'Jurassic Park', 'Schindler's List', 'Close Encounters' 'A.I' and so on. And I've realized how he directs better on atmosphere and terrain, not specifically on characters. How would you explain such a flat, unengaging relationship on screen between Hanks and Zeta Jones, dipped into an absurd, contrived relation? And the fact that we buy those thin characters as profoundly painted or widely written? That there is a suspension of belief on them letting Hanks in the Terminal, on the demeanor on Stanley Tucci's behavior? Im not gonna say it is a nice picture on bureaucracy edges.Nowadays, the world is filled with forms and papers, with rules and legislations, and making a story like these (besides it is based on facts) is not original but interesting. 'The Terminal' is an experiment on people that are 'stuck' in a place, on their limited environment. The fact that Spielberg chose to deepen into the characters, and just delivers a thin hologram of them, converts the movie into a disappointing failure.",5,7,13,6 January 2008
The Silence of the Lambs," Gnaw its way to the Mind Terror
","'Silence of the lambs' is one of the masterpieces of the last decade. And does it have its reasons. First of all, it's entirely dependant on the terror that gnaws all the way to the mind of the viewer. The decline of the Human Being is magnificently chiseled with one liners that amusingly depict the killers and psychopaths state of mind and approach us carefully into a nature that is deformed, evil and sick of the Man's putrefaction.The main spectacle is drawn between Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins. Both entirely relevant to the movie, they produce a bright contrast and with their performances they nail the feelings right and expose one of the best duels on movie history. This duel, although, is not conventional. Clarice Starling (Foster) will use Hannibal Lecter's (Hopkins) profound knowledge of the criminal mind to capture the infamous Buffalo Bill. But Hopkins will play a game in which their personalities will engage in a retroactive combination, in a 'quid pro quo' mind spar: she will have to expose her most profound, hidden secrets to Lecter, so he can also dispatch on his pleasure of analyzing the suffering of others. Both of them reveal all of their character's whole personality with their eyes: Foster is in constant pressure, scared but facing the natural Hades with courage and Hopkins shows human emptiness in his eyes, windows to what is a world full of depravations.Ted Levine is truly scary. You get the impression that he is the true Buffalo Bill, twisted and perverse. He shows absolutely no human, recognizable aspect. He is a terrible villain.The movie will straightly envelop you in an obscure labyrinth where the human mind is retorted and rotten, with a depressing score and settings that are grey, murky and never joyful. One has to see it to get a close approach on the dark side of the mind it or at least, to make their spirit shake and tremble.",10,5,11,26 November 2007
Casino Royale," Bond Reborn In Another Suit
","If you are a fan of the Bond Movies, then you should watch this immediately to put points straight. Bond is Reborn in 'Casino Royale' cutting loose of his British, sophisticated roots and entering a new terrain, a lot more raw and a lot more down to earth with him job.¿What Do I mean with this? Bond not only wears the impeccable suits and rides the luxury, stupendous cars. He takes his job to the edge, being the 'enfant terrible' of the agency, able to do the nasty killings and having a conceptual moral difficulty (which he hides) to attempt them. Let me also say this Bond also dives a lot more deeper in the psychological path: as in poker, viewer must look for the tells (sing on poker that deveals the nature of the player) of the story and understand the mind of double O-Seven and promptly construct a psychological profile of his that is well revised and greatly scripted.The Essence of Bond is quite yet maintained: people walk in the cleanest and most expensive Armanis, drink a glass of scotch while riding the first class cabins or going at high speeds with their Aston Martins or their Jaguars. The leather, the continuous use of white and green coloration and the lavishness surrounding the settings (the fantastic poker tables you want to submerge into, the antique, comfy and beautifully ornate hotels) make the movie a great visual adventure, and of course, expect fantastic chases, seeming unreliable but impressive, great liners, comedy moments, and a good love story that gives Bond the human flare that he needs. The cast is not packed with stars, and this point is needed to highlight: the lack of starstrucking make the experience a lot more challenging to the actors and their debuts in the series make them a lot more refreshing and interesting. I liked Daniel Craig, whose cold features give Bond the relinquishing, armored aspect and personality Bond needs yet he can cope with the love scenes and make an acceptable agent.Get your Mind off Connery, Brosnan, Moore. Craig is a different style: let's say, more American.Bond is quick on fast logic and cool reactions, on fine charm a little rougher. He is shown with his mistakes, he is humiliated and overwhelmed, his actions are punished and looked pitiable. This ambiguity makes Bond a lot more attractive to inspect. Mads Mikkelsen makes a great impact, Judi Dench puts on her heavy experience and Eva Green...well, she is pretty and simulates emotions quite fine, but still simulates them.The Bond Franchise is reborn: Martin Campbell gives it a twist and makes it a lot more darker, rougher, passionate.James is asked at one moment if he wants his martini shaked or stirred:-Do I look like I give a damn- he responds.So figure how they revalue Fleming's hero into more human and a less unreachable figure. The movie also strikes at more levels than usual. If you at least are not impressed, I'll say this: it has breathtaking paradises, fine women and poker.",9,3,6,28 November 2007
Amélie," A psychiatric cocktail of lunacy
","Please do not be fooled: Amelie is sick in the head. The titular character has very palpable schizophrenia, obsessive compulsive dissorder and I believe some autism too.She behaves more like an alien in a flesh suit, than a person. The world she lives in is brightly overexposed, yellow, sacharine and tragically depressing. She belongs in a nuthouse, and the movie should be a documentary about her lunacy. I know she is not a real person and a movie character, but someone please end her suffering.",3,6,10,10 February 2018
The Sixth Sense," Manipulation of Fears 'Par Excellence'
","Little Cole Sear (Halley Joel Osment) is a child that seems apart from the current world, called 'a freak' by his companions and always distracted and reluctant to connect to the others. Dr Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) intends to help him in order to redeem himself from a bad past experience. But as Dr. Crowe deepens into the interior of Cole, he will uncover his most profound and frightening secret.At the moment it starts, Shyamalan jolts with an uncanny music, formed by the precise scratching of superb violins. All throughout the movie the music will be vibrating, exhilarating, electrifying and yet oddly repulsive and leaving a sense of dismay and creepiness. Counting on lofty performances, emotional and groundbreaking by Halley Joel Osment, Toni Collete and star Bruce Willis, Shyamalan will clear it's field to proceed with his cunning game of manipulating the fear of the viewer. He will show you simple things, he will input the terror on ordinary stuff and common and daily elements: he will terrorize you with the using of a tape- recorder to hear whispers, he will play smartly with the shadows, mirrors, claustrophobic spaces to gasp the audience, and the use of an eerie wind always blowing to give the sense of distance and cold. He will give you a little space to start, then the fear will start erupting inside your mind.The photography by Tak Fujimoto is intense and subtle, never approaching with direct focus but with transversal, lateral imposing lens and toying softly with the use of reflections, rolling cameras and visuals in odd places that give the film superb aesthetics. Overall, the technical aspects contribute on leaving on the viewer a feeling of dread and restlessness, awkwardness.Shyamalan is genius at creating this suspense, avoiding blood and imposing a sly fear. That is why he became so popular.He also delivers a lot of psychological substance, a lot of profound lines of thinking. Joel's Osment relationship with his father is portrayed with great touches, like the glasses with no crystals and the watch not working he received from him. The Indian Director also exposes his viewings on explaining a story within his sublime script. At one point Malcolm tries to tell Cole a story: -You never told a story before right? You have to add some twists and stuff.Well prepare, because it is highly auto-referential. The script also brings forth bewitching descriptions of fear 'like falling down inside but you are standing still'. And then prepare for the twist. It will shake you to the ground and burn all of your movie principles. It is the Twist, what made the movie genius and so iconic.'Sixth Sense' is a cinematic bulwark, standing on an eternal and sublime direction. Its ending is emotional, and touching. This, in order to make contrast to the excellent creation of suspense and fear that bulges through the movie. Masterful.",9,1,1,5 December 2007
Rear Window," A Time Capsule
","Hitchock's smart review on voyeurism and human composed need for entertainment is fantastically stamped within 'Rear Window'. Those who see just a suspense story will overlook the most important backbone of the movie itself: the arrangement of a fauna of great, interesting human beings, each with their problems, happiness and something to scoop on.The story quickly digests important views where a man with his broken leg gets no other option than to spend time watching and examining his neighbors' life. Before Television arrived, this endearing inspection like Big Brother brings the fantastic nexus that ties up the story. But there will be a transformation where the watching will transform into an obsession, and the most inner feelings of connection with the other will be arisen by what we call voyeurism, or morbidness. We will unite sober James Stewart in his progressive burial over the neighborhood's secrets.There is in the movie one crucial analogy: the eyes watching the window. The eyes are subjective, and see what the mind wants to see. Curiously, eyes are the so called windows of the souls. Whereas the window exposes the reality, the fact to be interpreted (in many ways): here ambiguity strikes and in Jeffries situation it will present itself in the mood of paranoia. All of this scrutinizing over the others life is presented as unethical, but irresistible. Hitchcock uses Franz Waxman's moody music to alter the spectator's disposition to each scene, that lightens throughout the chilling sessions and paralyzes within the climax moments. There is a sense of fear, of being also observed and panicking of being discovered while enjoying the watch. The story seems possible and everyday, presented in a superb way, it will be more effective than what you expect it so. The photography is immense, roaming delicately over the used setting profiting on the smooth editing. We also can expect the most sophisticated and somewhat naive sense of humor to lighten the sordid tension of the movie.'Rear Window' lives clearly up to the reputation. It is a movie to be examined closely and enjoyed with a good glass of freezing cold water to set the mood right. I believe the movie is somewhat of a time capsule, a very good one indeed, because it has gone over more than fifty years since released, and its a beautiful way of being entertained as it paints a wonderful picture of the era: the way they talked, they dressed, they spent their time. Time cannot falter pieces of art as this one. It renders past oblivion.",9,3,5,3 December 2007
The Matrix," Dynamite to my Brain
","Strangely, Matrix is one of the few action films that open my brain to deep, profound thinking while at the same time it magnetizes me with the most brutally good action scenes. Putting together the thinking line of the new generation, where we are just but pawns in a system we don't understand or belong, Matrix also borrows a lot of the oriental culture with the fights and it's inner travel over the nature of Life.Little by little one will start to see the light, and everything will make sense. By the second view, you will get a higher conception. By your third view this will amaze you. Brawn mixed with brains. The Matrix IS the science fiction film. With a perfect script that drowns so profoundly into the true nature of things, and with major, Industrial high tech digital action, I will ask you this if you haven't seen the movie:-What are you doing reading this instead??",10,17,31,20 November 2007
Looper," Looper Spider
","'Looper' cashes in some aspects that are really well executed: Gordon Levitt is touched with a very nuanced make up to make him look like a young Willis. Somehow the portrayal of a 'asphalt jungle' future has the condiments of other dystopian films, but fails to explain and deploy the background of it and has only the immediate effect. And the action moments are curiously lacking in intensity, in correlating with the characters.Though it does play by the rules it pronounces; 'Looper' seems to avoid answering or even clearing the webs that form around plot holes. Time travel is a bitch to treat, and the decision to let go of some key questions seems like less of artistic merit and more of development comfort. Why did Sara know that Joe was a Looper? Why did young Joe convince himself on killing Old Joe while he could simply take the gold that was already packed and safeguard his future by sparing himself? It feels more like we do not care for the questions, than need to know the answers.",3,1,2,23 January 2013
Heat," Film Noir Reset ***May contain spoiler***
","Heat (1995) Film Noir Reset /**may contain spoiler**/, 16 April 2006If you miss Film Noir, Michael Mann is the Man for you. This cinematographic vampire knows the dark and how to capture it perfectly, it creates another type of film noir: no sirens, no dark alleys, no black & white heroes. Film Noir here is the night and the lights, the N.York moon washing the routes. Pacino and De Niro are the price of the entrance, they are antagonic examples of how a director can present two opposite characters as human beings, with acute dialogs but some ponds in between. The 3 hours prepare the final confrontation in the urban savannas of the airport, and shows how in these nowadays world a thief and a police are separated by centimeters, while they should be apart by kilometers. De Niro with his penetrating look, Pacino with his mighty thundering voice. A good Val Kilmer, John Voight and correct Ashley Judd complete the cast (with the presence of genius William Fitncher) An excellent sound, a galactic edition and a cool music manage the scenes to be genius.The battle in the middle of the streets, in plain day: what a scene. Movies are made for this. The couple obviously shines, but the master here is truly Michael Mann. I look forward to see his next movie because he is a fine and talented director",7,0,1,7 November 2007
Slumdog Millionaire," Bollywood/ Hollywood weak morph.
","Basically, Slumdog Millionaire is the transposition of clichéd American cinema into the den of Bollywood. All of the layers and sub-layers are so repeated and overly done that it causes no effect on the viewer. It's the same applied to third world countries, it's a simple deceptive notion.The love story, with the man running desperately to defend his loved one, with his impositions, maybe a criminal undercurrent with already seen and done mafia innuendos, classical tension moments in which time plays a cruel role already examined. Even the moments that seem to 'bring glow' from the cramped, poor slums just seem overly edited and manipulative. In story terms, nothing is actually new in the movie. Thus, nothing is truly exciting, except for those who are relatively new to Hollywood, who are tricked into believing that 'glamour' was actually strained from the sets and that India (or at least Indian cinema) is close to whatever Boyle tried to create.You've seen this thousand times, just in other countries and other cultures. Cool trick, uh?",4,10,16,29 August 2009
The Simpsons Movie," Not my Doodle-Lee-Doodle Movie
","Let's be honest, cult series 'The Simpsons' has been decreasing in quality as long as seasons grew higher. There has been a lot of more political innuendos, more toilet humor and less classy dialogs. Well, my five doesn't go to the movie itself but to the movie as a representation of the Simpsons to the Big Screen. If we go back to early Simspons, conflicts were simple dumb and hysterical, not complicated, neither multi-layered and not critical politically but sociologically. The charm that the family shared was based on wit and an amusing essence that was separated and appointed to each character: Homer is brainless exhilarating, Marge is the average caring mother, Lisa is the Voice of Reason, Bart is the Rebel we all have. Each has it's sharp connotation.But it seems Groening forgot that essence, that one that attracted youngsters and delighted adults. Some characters remain with the initial spark, yet Homer, Marge, Lisa and Bart seem exploited to fit into the Hollywood standards. It depraved it's natural beauty. Homer mainly. There's some unevenness in it's humor and mood that leaves me unsatisfied.Don't get me wrong, the movie is funny and if you choose brainless fun, not to take it too serious, it will contempt you. Yet, the addition of Nudity, desire of killings, gay people, politics, pork crap, cheap sentimentalism... The formula seems for a funny pot-humor Hollywood presentation, but the Simpsons are celestial.I had a nice laugh, but this series is sacred. You can't play with them. I enjoyed it, laughed, but I can't call it a good movie yet. Maybe it's the idea of the movie that was wrong. I find myself preferring to watch over and over again the episodes from the first seasons, where Groening wasn't yet affected by that growling Machine we call Hollywood.",6,2,2,17 January 2008
Up in the Air," The Clooney Clash
","Clooney is without a doubt in my mind one of the best actors of his generation. He may be undermined for the fact he chooses (or chose) roles molded exactly for his limitations: a man of easy virtue normally, thoughtful, aware and unaware of his environment in a complex- puzzled looking face, without explosive furious needs, or crying parts, or anger blasts.Since 'Michael Clayton' he flipped degrees with his performance. He has a very noticeable emotional undercurrent. We know that at the time he is acting he is internally lubricating every inch of his voice, his stare, and his posture. To watch him is to watch a real person, and he lets the character do 'osmosis' through his persona. 'Up in the Air' is basically about a man that we can relate to, given in perfect accordance to George Clooney. He is trailed by a beautiful and shivering Anna Kendrick and correct stars, obviously pushed with a masterful script that knocks well on today's crisis time.",8,1,3,27 January 2010
Atonement," A Beautiful Yet Exhausting Film
","This movie, although many will go against this declaration, is not for every type of viewer. Those who enjoy ampulous movies, watching the production details, or gasping against fabulous skies and fields for minutes, and enjoy a lenghty, slowly told story; will like it. Those (most likely men) who enjoy another type of movies; fast movies, with fulfilling characters, twists and sudden changes, will be disappointed by Atonement.My partial disliking of the film, however, comes through another lane. The story, and semi-spoiler ahead, centers mainly and poses the eye on the couple of Robbie (McAvoy) and Cecilia (Knieghtly) and it's relationship. Yet their relationship is nothing more than a sexual attraction arising from years of close living together. Their is no inner travels to their feelings, but to their thoughts. It's a cold relationship, moved by some impacts and problems that do not really satisfy the romantic crave.Later we realize the focus and most compromising story gathers around Briony (a beautiful and genius Saoirse Ronan) and her story of Atonement through a mistake she did. We will appreciate the closing, her development, and she will be the most endurable character.Then why did the story hesitated in showing random scenes of Robbie at war, showing the despair of War that nothing has to do with the spine of the movie. The story of Lola doesn't bring much to the story, but a device to fuel the conflicts. Neither does the long stays at hospitals.Why did they deviate the focus so much, why did they change the optic on stories, not knowing who finally is the backbone of the movie? 'Atonement' is beautiful, has delicious camera works and stylized production values. Yet it is exhausting, dipped into much detail and perspective the inner struggle of characters isn't fully developed.If it was a tad less cold, and more explicit in their sentiments, I would have liked it more. Yet, and I don't know why: I recommend you to see it. At least so you can get your own conclusion.",6,5,11,17 February 2008
V for Vendetta," Viciously Overrated
","I went with high expectations to watch 'V for Vendetta'. The Wachowski's reputation on creating poignant, smart action packed rides preceded them. With 'Matrix' not only did I get one of the freshest action films but one of the sharpest and deepest scripts ever written. All I can give to this movie as a word is 'pseudo'. V is a pseudo-hero, that prefers to talk and digress than commit the noble acts. James McTiegue knows how to cope with filmical elements, but that's all. V (by Hugo Weaving) doesn't relate to the audience and has no point of contact with any common human, his basis of thoughts are fragile and biased. A hero in an anarchy isn't only interesting (not on the way delivered) but unoriginal. And political. Who could move it to a higher ground? All what it tries to achieve it fails. V is also Pseudo-Cool. His Shakespearean, long dialogs are boring and unfelt. All seems like an improvised catharsis.What's new on 'V for Vendetta'? Absolutely nothing. No chemistry between the two leads, empty dialogs and many colors and fireworks to dazzle us an distract us from the lack of good action, a steamy screenplay on action or clever and quick on themes and messages. Not only does it fail in delivering a message, ideology or thinking line (no power in communication to the audience) but it also lacks a good atmosphere and tons of action are missing. I hoped for much, maybe. It had many elements to bring new things on the ground. It busted them too soon.Long story short, this movie is unfelt and shy, keeping a close remark to the comic books, giving it no further nor personal power. Long, it is a feast on neat sound effects an clean CGI (which tries to push us further from the weak adapted script). It could have been a lot more; for you that like new, fresh movies. Skip this. In my humble opinion, it's unnecessary.",3,5,13,13 November 2007

More If I go with friends.And 'Where art thou brother?' shines up Coen's maximal expansionist talent: to make each character a fool and ridicule the environment. And that's how half joke, half serious the movie introduces us in a endless plateau of ridiculous characters, fake obsessions and clowny language. And three friends in the Search of a treasure will find how the treasure itself is the hunt for it.Visually striking, meaningful, great acting.
