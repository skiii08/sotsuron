Scarface," Never gets old
","I have rated Gladiator and Dunkirk 10/10, I have watched Scarface literally 100 times more than those, so why only 9/10? It's because of spoilers, and what could have been, and what would be abhorrently portrayed. I was all in for Tony's success, regardless.
If you have ever played GTA Vice City, you have played this film, another reason for it's greatness. It really does deserve 10/10 but because of it's less than savoury topics, it just wouldn't be right.
I love this film and never tire of it, it's violent, sometimes shocking, and full of the swears. In film terms I believe it is a beautiful portrayal of 'if you play with matches, you will get burned'.
I don't like myself for thinking it, but there was one decision that could have shown otherwise.... maybe in a sequel... :-DTwo other points, exceptional soundtrack, and quotable lines every other minute.",9,0,0,30 October 2019
Gravity," Amazing cinematography
","First off, don't watch this for the plot, it's ridiculous! Get passed that and accept this as a movie, not an accurate portrayal of space travel and it's highly enjoyable. I am very demanding in what I require for 'space' films, especially if they sell themselves as 'possible' or 'realistic'.Having said this I went into Gravity with an open mind and despite the numerous and many inaccuracies, I really enjoyed it. It's a roller-coaster ride with outstanding visuals and a nice touching element of humanity. A fine example of when the content does not have to be too strong when all the elements around it to piece it together are so visually and audibly stunning.
As a gamer, it is often said good graphics do not make a good game, this movie proves that statement does not apply to cinema.",8,0,0,16 February 2020
Interstellar," The things we love most, hurt us the most
","I believe Christopher Nolan is possibly the best director around at present, and I love space/science fiction. I try very hard to go into films blind, knowing as little as possible. To say I was looking forward to this is a massive understatement, which probably is why I feel more critical over it than just passing it off as a mediocre movie, it is not.I had to watch it a second time to change my view from abysmal to, okay, it has some merits, but it ain't the story!Honestly I think my highlight to this film is the soundtrack, Hans Zimmer proves once again what a powerhouse he is in creating visual splendour out of sound. An absolute master in his craft.Visually it's also relatively stunning and has some intriguing concepts. Besides this though, I just didn't buy it, it was too unbelievable and all I heard before watching was how it was supposed to be accurate, or as accurate as is perceptible. I appreciate this was a big movie with the aim of appealing to a large audience, but how some of the script has to explain to the audience what is going on was just a massive fail for me and completely took away my immersion.I wanted to like this movie so much, I've tried watching it multiple times, I just don't. It has all the right ingredients for a sumptuous cake but it's like they forgot to put the filling in and it's just sponge, nice sponge, but not a sponge you would later tell your friends about, or post on social media (if that's your thing).I could point out specifics but they would be spoilers and I try to maintain spoiler free reviews. If you are interested in watching I would still very much say yes go for it, there's every chance you may think my review is unfair. I am definitely right about the soundtrack though, that is exceptional.",6,1,1,16 February 2020
Predator," Action/sci fi to set the standards
","I'm going to keep this review brief, suffice to say if you have not seen this movie, your opinions on action movies are worthless. This set the standard before a lot of you wore diapers, but not just that, it STILL holds up and no Predator movie has come close to matching it since.Regardless what movie you are discussing with a friend, if they have not seen this, their opinion is not yet valid.",9,1,2,30 October 2019
Dunkirk," A worthy addition to the war genre. Just incredible.
","I want to keep this review brief (things can and do change!), let me first say my great uncle was captured by the Japanese in WWII and subsequently the POW ship he was on was blown up by the Americans. He never returned home. There are only losers in war.I am generally a cold-hearted s.o.b. when it comes to movies but WWII can really churn me up inside, this one had me sobbing like a child, for the right reasons.At first I was completely enamoured by the amazing colour and beauty of the moving images on screen, it was like a colourised black & white image from the time. War does not look this pretty. As the film progressed that imagery started to come together to engage the characters thoughts and emotions with barely a word said. By the end, well, it was a journey.In rigid terms of film itself, Christopher Nolan has shown his true form again and created an outstanding piece of work and I applaud all involved.Do I recommend this movie? Yes, 100%.I wouldn't dream of giving a score of 10/10 to any film but for the impact it had with me, to give it 9/10 would be a disservice.Watch it and disagree with me, but let us never forget. We should never forget.Edit Oct 2019: Not only do I stand my original view, it's only grown stronger. I am utterly dismayed to see some reviews giving less than 5 stars, these are children that do not know film, and certainly have no conception of war and the sacrifices that come with it (and not least constructive criticism). They should be ignored without question. It is a testament to Nolans work to maintain such a high rating amongst fools with a keyboard.
I adore Christopher Nolan but for me, Interstellar was a huge let down (but in terms of film, very exceptional).
This is his Opus Magnum, it can be hard to quantify for the uninitiated, but we are initiated. I cry just thinking about this film, having seen it once it is truly a difficult time to experience again, but we must, and when I need a good cry I now have a choice of Gladiator or Dunkirk.This is the one of very few films that will make you cry through your nose. I will always break down when Derek Jacobi says 'Who will help me carry him' towards the end of Gladiator, if Kenneth Branagh saying 'so far' does not equivocate the same with yourself, I pity your absolute lack of empathy.I'm a 40 year old man, I don't want this kind of sadness but I need it to remind me just how lucky I am and what truly makes a man, human.
During these times woman were not forced nor volunteered for this kind of chaos, not to say they were not part of it, no-one deserves to be part of it, and this film encapsulates that fact like no other I have seen in the modern era.
Christopher Nolan (and cast & crew), I salute thee.",10,1,2,6 January 2018
Avengers: Endgame," A beautiful finale to a long running story arc
","To be fair there has been a lot of build up story and character development movies to this, but what a payoff. Will there ever be such reward for the audience that has followed the journey? I find it hard to believe. If there ever is I hope to experience it in my lifetime.With Infinity War to complement this main story-line, the audience is given an absolute treat. I am grateful to have followed this journey since 2008 and avoided all spoilers. Put simply, in my opinion, if you have seen all the preceding MCU movies, Infinity War and Endgame are the best action/superhero movies ever.",10,3,10,16 February 2020
1917," Required viewing for lovers of film
","I think I have said in at least one other review, I don't like giving 10/10 as a review score, but some films just deserve it, and in my opinion this is one of those.
I also don't like to give any plot lines or any hint at the film itself, it's called 1917, it's based around WW1, that's all you need.The cinematogrophy is outstanding, the acting sublime. This film does not get in it's own way, I was totally absorbed on every level. Just watch it.",10,1,4,17 January 2020
Guardians of the Galaxy," Highly enjoyable
","I didn't know what to expect going in to this but being a child of the 80's it quickly established itself with a great soundtrack and a very light-hearted approach.From there it was just a great, fun movie and took very little time to like all the characters. I have seen maybe 10 movies in 3D and in that respect I found this the best 3D movie I have watched. That's a minor point, this movie made me laugh, smile and care for the characters. At the end I felt thoroughly satisfied.The only downside was it meant the sequel would always struggle to match it.",9,0,0,16 February 2020
2001: A Space Odyssey," A timeless classic
","When this released one year before the Moon landings, the timeline was plausible, unfortunately popular interest in space travel diminished as did its funding.It is difficult to quantify the mastery in film-making that this encompasses, there is good reason Kubrick is regarded so very highly. Make no mistake this film is not for everyone, it requires patience and thought. By the end, you will probably be left confused, and admittedly I still am somewhat unsure of the ending but I do not seek for it to be explained. I prefer the confusion, it allows for my thoughts to be provoked and to draw my own conclusions, this is a good thing and successful outcome of fantastic film crafting.When you stare at the credits and try to comprehend what you have just seen, for me, that is a truly great film. In context though, this is only relevant when the build up to the finale is so perfect and for this particular film, so accurate in its portrayal of events leading to it.It's astonishing to think this is now over 50 years old, it still very much holds up as it was so grounded in realistic foresight. If you allow it around 20 years grace because of the de-funding of space travel you will find it will still hold up in most aspects for another 10 years or more.2001: A Space Odyssey has been the benchmark for all space/science-fiction for me having first seen it at around age 12-13 back in 1992-93, it still has no competition in that regard.",9,1,1,16 February 2020
Pulp Fiction," Tarantino's Magnum Opus
","As years pass and I get older, when speaking to people many years my younger and inevitably getting to the topic of movies and film, this is always the first one I enquire if they have watched, and also inevitably demand it is the next thing they watch.It remains possibly the most entertaining script to cross genres, I don't feel you can really pigeon-hole this to a genre, it has a bit of everything. It's one of a select few films you wish you could watch again for the first time, but watching it for a second, third, eighth, tenth time... it still feels fresh and still makes you laugh.The casting is just spot on, and the performances across the board are so memorable, even the bit-parts. I have watched this so many times I could probably recite the entire dialogue with a high degree of accuracy. As many a good film I have seen I would be hard pressed to state a better script, I can't think of many, if any lines of dialogue that don't need to be there. That is an outstanding achievement.
On top of this there's also the awesome soundtrack, when I first saw this I can't say I had heard any of the tracks before, subsequently it was one of the first soundtracks I bought the CD. As with Reservoir Dogs, Tarantino's choice of music was incredibly effective for the vibe of the film.There is some violence but it is not gratuitous and adds to the story. Now stop reading this and go watch it.",10,2,3,16 February 2020
It Chapter Two," Much better than expected
","I am in no means a fan of modern horror movies and not really a fan of horror in general, if ghosts or the paranormal are involved I check out or don't even check in. There are exceptions, an obvious one being The Shining.I had seen and read a general dislike to this movie upon release but I have seen the original, and the recent remake of the first part so inevitably I was going to watch this. To my surprise I actually quite enjoyed it and I would normally be a prime contender to berate at the first opportunity. I thought it was good fun, though maybe that is not the soundbite you want from a 'scary' movie.I'm not sure I've ever been affected by jump scares, I just don't react to them, for me there was only one in this movie and it was obviously on it's way (ballon, bed, asylum), but nonetheless it was some of the imagery I enjoyed, that skit being one. The old lady I thought was fantastic.It's against the norm for me but I thought the humour was actually funny, I've definitely seen supposed comedies with much fewer laughs, I didn't feel this detracted from the 'horror' as 'horror' films don't really exist anymore. I was along for the ride and that's no small feat for me and this genre.The most horrifying scene is probably the opening scene, beyond that I generally liked most of the cast so it was somewhat irreverent to me how their journey's progressed as mentioned, I was onboard for the ride.It's a long movie but I felt it moved along at a decent pace, I can understand some of the criticisms, this could have had a much darker tone though I watched the original IT for the first time only a short time before the release of the first part of the remake, I can only really remember the second half of the original being ridiculous any way. I barely remember the first part of the remake ....but in this ....that old lady, that's going to stay with me for a while.Overall I think if you go into this with an open mind it's generally quite enjoyable, a bit silly and a bit sick. I think I will leave it there reiterating my words above 'good fun'.",7,1,1,25 January 2020
Blade Runner," 9.5/10
","In 1927 there was Metropolis, 55 years later there was Bladerunner. In my mind these are the two most influential sci-fi films ever made.(*Disclaimer, yes Alien, yes Star Wars, my thoughts on the above are based on a possible reality (yes, I know Bladerunner is now set in the past!!))Not my greatest review ^ but this is one of my all-time favourite films.",9,1,3,16 February 2020
Blade Runner," 9.5/10
","I did write a terrible review for this, one of my all time favourite films. This review is not much better but suffice to say this is one of a handful of sci-fi films that demand viewing if you are into sci-fi. If you are not into sci-fi and want a challenging film about possible futures, this is still a must-see.I give my review of this seminal piece of work, 2/10.",9,1,4,16 February 2020
The Matrix," A Masterpiece
","20 years ago as I left the cinema from watching The Matrix, I was pissed off, it was an odd sensation and feeling. I had gone to see what I thought would be an action movie with some state of the art special effects, and kung fu.
I was pissed off because I was not at all prepared for such an amazing, intelligent and intricate story, to this day arguably one of the best in modern cinema and storytelling.I am reticent to ever call this a science-fiction film, the 'sci' yes, but the 'fi', well, if you have seen this film you will understand.This film set new standards in so many areas, I could write pages over so many small facets but I like to keep reviews fairly short. If you have any interest in film this is required viewing, it's as simple as that.",10,1,1,29 December 2019
Gladiator," My favourite film ever amongst true greats
","I have given this and Dunkirk 10/10, both films without fail make me cry like a baby and I have a heart of stone. It is very hard to justify 10/10 but for their sheer consistency in manipulating my emotions I cannot fault either film. They are both the epitome of filming excellence and should be observed as such.Gladiator has been my favourite film almost since it came out, I say almost as like any true work of art, I didn't necessarily absorb it's full clout on first viewing, which to me is not only okay, it's a testament to great film (on first viewing I didn't get American Psycho at all, 2nd viewing I saw it's excellence).I do believe you should not give 10/10 reviews but there has to be exceptions when it is truly deserved and this is one of those few times. I have an ability to pick holes in almost any film I watch, I have to say almost as in this, I can not. If I HAD to pick a hole, almost 20 years later it would be the cgi, which is pretty much flawless.I don't review with spoilers or hints at plot, I prescribe to advising why this is a necessary part of your film education.
Put simply, with this film, if you have not seen it and/or have no opinion of it, you're opinion means nothing to me. It's that simple.",10,2,3,30 October 2019
