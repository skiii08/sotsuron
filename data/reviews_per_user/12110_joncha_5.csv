Marie Antoinette," Falls short in many ways
","This was a colorful, opulent depiction of the court of Louis XV and Louis XVI and helps to answer the question 'Who was Marie Antionette?' However, it falls short in revealing much about the woman beyond the superficial, which may have in fact been the essence of her personality. The film also fails to depict any indication of the unrest that led to the Revolution, so if one was totally ignorant of historical facts it might seem like the plot had a lot of holes and left many questions unanswered. The use of modern music instead of 18th century music did nothing to enhance the quality of the story.",5,2,2,12 October 2018
Pearl Harbor," poor fact, worse fiction
","It is almost impossible to mix historic fact and actual personalities from the past with fictional characters and plot. The last one to do this really well was Leo Tolstoy, although Herman Wolk did a pretty good job in 'The Winds of War.' If you want to see a love story set against the background of military life at Pearl Harbor just before December, 1941, then you can't top 'From Here to Eternity.' If you want to know how and why the attack took place, see 'Tora! Tora! Tora!' If you want to know the true story of Doolittle's raid (even if Spencer Tracy looked no more like Jimmy Doolittle than Alec Baldwin does), see 'Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo.' If you want to see great World War II air combat (with no computerized effects) see 'The Battle of Britain.' If you want special effects and computerized air combat, see 'Star Wars.' -- JONCHA",6,0,0,24 June 2001
Defiance," Dramatic and inspiring
","This is such a dramatic and inspiring story. It is good to see there is a monument to the Bielski fighters somewhere (shown in the supplemental material included with the DVD, presumably near the forest in Belarus). Because the brothers later emigrated to the U.S., it would nice to have a monument in Central Park or somewhere in NYC, where they settled. It could be dedicated not only to the original fighting group but also to their thousands of descendants.

Elizabeth: The Golden Age," Doesn't live up to its title
","I wish I could give this film a higher rating in view of its lush costuming, locations, and casting. However, it doesn't live up to its title, and one anticipates a 'Golden Age, Part II' (Or was that covered in 'Shakespeare in Love'?) Too much of this is simplistic history. The Spanish are depicted as the embodiment of evil while the English are pictured as a freedom loving people who only reluctantly torture captives and lop off people's heads and are beginning to persecute others for their religious beliefs with less and less intensity. The Armada is seen as a vast, invincible force brought low by some bad weather and fire ships, especially the last one launched in superhero fashion by Sir Walter Raleigh. (The scene of him leaping into the sea at the last minute is sort of funny now, because it resembles so much the TV commercial featuring John Jameson diving into raging waters to retrieve a barrel of his treasured whiskey.) And what's with the horse jumping overboard? Was that supposed to be symbolism of some kind? I half expected Sir Walter to come back on land riding the horse! Any one who watches the History or Military Channel knows that the defeat of the Armada was much more complicated. There was no lack of bravery on the part of the English sailors, but bad weather played a much bigger role in the total distruction of the Armada than is pictured in the film. Finally, without a deep knowlege of English history, it's hard to tell who is who in these dramas, and what their motives are for their actions. Even before you can figure out who someone is, he is arrested for treason, tortured, and hanged.",7,0,0,12 October 2018
Munich," The hunters become the hunted
","This is a thought-provoking movie, to say the least. At first you get the impression that it will be a straight-forward account of revenge and retribution, the killing or assassination of the individuals responsible for planning the massacre of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich. However, it quickly becomes apparent that the story is much more complicated than that. The Israeli assassination squad, although supposedly professionals in their field, do not carry out their tasks with the cold blooded efficiency one normally sees in a James Bond or Arnold Schwartzenegger movie. They fumble with their weapons, hesitate to pull the trigger, set unrealistic parameters regarding 'collateral damage' and then are overcome with guilt when any 'non-target' is killed. Finally, the hunters become the hunted, realizing that the underworld of paid informants can also be turning over information about them to their enemies. Paranoia (displayed primarily by Avner, the team leader) that is created by 'being hunted' is combined with the realization that the 'targets' of their mission may not have all be directly connected to the Munich massacre and the total purpose of their mission may never be explained to them. Added to this are the 'unintended consequences' of their actions, as they realize that each individual they eliminate is often replaced by one or more successors who are even more dedicated to the goal of destroying Israel. And, as Avner's conversation with the Palestinian Ali shows, each side in the conflict can demonstrate a moral purpose to their cause, justifying whatever actions they may take, no matter how those actions violate the morality of their society. What began as a tale of black-and-white issues becomes, in the end, a morass of decisions, actions, consequences, and, sadly, a failure to reach any conclusion or closure to the anger and suffering caused by the initial act of terrorism.",9,1,2,12 October 2018
