Ford v Ferrari," Not a competition but the true race of life!
","As all of the true masterpieces, Ford v Ferrari isn't only about the race, rather more compelling challenge of the life. Where individualism comes to question should we rethink our values on collectivism? What makes the perfect connection between you and family and how true are our friendships are the questions that the movie challenges it's viewers. Funny yet thrilling story dramatized in the most perfect way possible. It doesn't matter if one outpowers the other, what matters is to win the race of life!",10,1,2,25 November 2019
Yesterday," Different!
","Yesterday has a concept that is fairly different from ordinary movies. Storyline is simple, yet powerful enough. The flow is remarkably smooth and the movie is grasping as well. Humors will make you laugh from time to time and sure you won't regret any of your time. Good one!",9,1,3,5 October 2019
Batman Begins," Astonishing!
","To be honest, I always thought that the people supporting DC Universe were the ones not being able to agree on that the Marvel made better movies. The ones that tried to be different as they felt insecure about their own intelligence. This made to think twice. Batman Begins isn't only exciting, also, it's smart on its own way. The movie is filled with wise quotes and most importantly, it delivers what most movies can't do. A message. Not only it exceeded my expectations, but filled me with the memories that'll never be forgotten. Shortly, Christopher Nolan is the best director ever!",10,1,1,23 August 2019
Joker," Put on a Happy Face!
","Where Dark Knight illustrates Batman's view on society, this is the view of Joker. Through him, we see the dark, the oppressed, ones that never stood a chance whether in Dark Knight, we saw the bright side of the road. Joker isn't the vigilante, he is the part of the society that was never given a luck. He is the part of us where we leave in the dark and in the dark moments, he wakes up. Hysterical isn't it? He isn't the villian but not the hero as well.
Joaquin Phoenix never disappointed me with his performances though he cannot compete with Ledger. Shots were superb, but the movie lacked the conversations. Joker in this movie, doesn't talk as much as he talked in Dark Knight.
But all in all, movie underlies the important issues of the society and gives us a clear look on what we're missing. It's filled with smart details and deep meanings. Bravo!!!",10,1,2,2 October 2019
