Hereditary," People were laughing their asses off.
","I have honestly been to comedies where people laughed less.The movie does have some very good concepts, but a lot of clumpsiness and extremely bad/fake effects screw it up every time.The first half of the movie is really slow and gets really *REALLY* boring. In the second half a bit more starts to happen. However: The story is so bad that they literally explain it to you in the end. The acting is mostly quite good. The movie is not a laughing matter from beginning to the end. There are some creepy moments, but they are as standard as can be (guy strolling through a dark house alone) but of course the scene can't end without being hilarious first.",3,1,3,14 June 2018
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Mediocre at best
","If you want to see some simple action, you gonna like this movie. But if you are looking for a bit more depth you should watch something else.Of course it is not easy creating a good inbetweener. But this movie doesn't even seem to try. The idea of R1 was to 'fix' a plot hole in EP4, but it only seems to create more plot holes. I checked spoilers but let's be honest: If you've seen the trailer and the movie poster: There is nothing left to spoil. The trailer tells you the plot and the movie poster tells you that everyone will die in the end: The cheapest and easiest way to get rid of a cast you don't need in the next movie (EP4). This movie could have been so much more and be the start of a fantastic spin-off that runs parallel to the original trilogy (like Enter the Matrix game did for the Matrix movies) but Disney chose for the easy way.Basically: The movie is your standard Disney formula with standard plot line (only this time very thin), standard comical character for the humor, only the end is slightly different (but surely not better)Even the soundtrack feels flat, forced and cheap and is at most places in the movie just cringey. John Williams does a way better job but even from Hans Zimmer I'm used way better than this.",3,86,176,21 December 2016
