Ford v Ferrari," An amazing story brought to the screen by two outstanding actors.
","The biggest contender for an Oscar award in my opinion. It deserves all of it's praise, it is the most amazing movie I've seen this year, I never expected to be so touched by an original story about an american car company which evolved into something way more. Demon and Bale are freaking amazing, both of them are outstanding actors that made this movie good as it is, they leak emotion, quality, professionality and talent. The ending was so sad and emotional that it made me wanna come back in time and change the circumstances and the outcome of the story....One of the best movie ever played by both of them.",8,1,2,1 February 2020
The Avengers," One of Marvel's greatest.
","Marvel never seemed to dissapoint, but this time they went far ahead of them and created maybe their best movie ever. The feeling you get when you see 5-6 action heroes, all doing crazy good stuff and helping each other in some fun and interesting ways, tactics and fights is bigger entertainment than anything else a movie can give. The dialog between them, the way they hate and admire each other at the sime time, their personalities and powers, all mixed together in one big superhero gem that offers everything that is possible to offer, not to mention the work that was obviously put in visual effects and design. The villain is everything, he is the driving force and gives maybe an Oscar worthy villain performance.",7,1,2,4 May 2018
Blade Runner 2049," Maybe this sounds stupid, but it is to much of a sequel for me.
","The movie overall was okay, it had some amazing visuals, the cyberpunk setting never seems to dissapoint me in movies like this and the acting was top notch, but the movie depended way to much on the original, which by the way, is 10x better than this one and is one of the greatest movies ever. I know that the pace of the original was also slow, but still it had some very interesting intensive drama and action, this movie feels way to much slow and blank with not a lot of dialog also and soundtrack that often feels more like just a noise than somekind of music. The soundtrack of the original was also amazing in comparison to this one which was maybe a bit to slow to match the pace of the movie. Anyway, Ryan did an awesome job and that is all that I must respect from this movie.N",6,2,5,17 July 2019
Scarface," The imperfection is the reason this is considered a masterpiece.
","The imperfection is the reason this is considered a masterpiece. All the obvious flaws that the movie has, almost looking intentional, are the sole reasons why this unbelieveable gem depicts from other movies in it's genre. Al Pacino is once again phenomenal, over the top, it's like he is a mafia boss in his private life, not only on screen. The brutality, unforgiveness, greed, lust for power, everything is so perfectly portrayed, yet, feeling a bit rough around the edges, which is why this movie will be forever remembered, it is something we have not seen before, and will not see ever again.",8,0,0,10 April 2020
The Incredible Hulk," Great movie, I missed at least one more antagonist.
","This movie is pure awesomeness. I don't understand why people were so much hating on it when in reality it is an amazing Marvel movie. Edward Norton was over the top, his acting skills are astonishing and he fits the calm, but in reality out of control personality of Banner perfectly. Abomination was also a very well made anti-hero and the fight at the end was great. I hope that they had really good reasons not to take Edward Norton further in the MCU and I hope that it was his fault for not beeing selected for the Avengers cast.",7,1,2,22 January 2019
Iron Man 3," One of the most overrated MCU movies and by far the worst in the Iron Man trilogy.
","I now completely understand how much MCU movies are overrated by the wider audience, especially by the HC fans. I've watched Black Panther, now I've watched this and I realised how mediocre this movies are, but still they made a huge amount of money and have a great rating on IMDB. This movie offers nothing special, the story offers next to nothing, the anti-heroes have never been worse, the CGI is bad, the way everyone fires up like the fire guy from Fantastic 4 makes me wanna puke, the ending is boring and Iron Man for some reason, I guess on purpose, is way less involved in action sequences and drama than the previous movies which makes the movie worse than they planned... oh well, 5/10 for me.",5,1,4,8 June 2018
Finding Neverland," Something to cry to.
","Johnny Depp is by far the most unic male actor you'll se in your lifetime, a person that can make even the most simple thing a whole universe. In this movie, he grabs the beautifulness and deepness of the amazing story that this movie is telling and makes it even 10 times more touching, alive and heartbraking. Everything about this movie is flawless, the acting, the scenery, the characters. The child that is taking the role of Peter which also acted together with Depp in Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory is the best young actor I've ever seen, every time a tear rolls down his cheek I roll one too. If you are in a need for a thrilling emotional movie ride this is the movie you need because it will leave you breathless and heartbroken, thinking about how good this peace of art is.",7,1,2,13 October 2018
Lone Survivor," The actor's performances bring glory to this movie.
","The movie producer could've not chosen a better cast than this one. Every single one of the actors does his best and even goes beyond that to make this movie great, the acting is truly exceptional. Maybe the whole scenario was a bit blank, but it is based on a real event, so no hard feelings there. The gore and brutality that was shown and is actually really happening in those kind of situations brought a deep sense and emotion to the movie, altho some of the scenes went beyond realistic and were to much from me, like the constant falling of the cliffs without dying.",7,1,2,25 May 2018
Akira," The best hand-drawn thing I have seen in my life.
","This is by far the best hand-drawn animation I've seen in my entire life and it surpasses every single anime that is praised for the hand-drawn animation like Dragonball, Naruto and many other anime series. It has been made in 1988 and it is way ahead of it's time, Disney is just a copycat in my eyes from now on for me. The story is complicated and deep and altho I understood some of it, I know that if I watch it at least one more time everything will get clearer, especially the ending. An amazing piece of art that has a bigger meaning than many live action movies that are praised for the same reason.",8,4,7,20 March 2019
Train to Busan," Not the everyday zombie movie you are expecting to see.
","Asian movies are such an underrated jem and this movie proves it once again. The tension building, the acting, the drama, the horror, the very good looking zombies, the emotions, everything is top class. You know a movie is good when you deeply connect with the main character in only 1 hour of watching. The zombies are not those typical zombies you see in every zombie movie, plus they are being smarter than the usual ones. 8/10 at least for me",8,2,3,5 March 2018
The Maze Runner," Fun and entertaining movie to watch.
","I am not a person that likes to give negative reviews and have negative perspective on things, especially when movies are the subject. There for, I like this movie pretty much. Yes, if you read the goofs you will notice that there are a lot of mistakes and things that could have been done to escape the Maze, but they are not done, but still, it is a quality movie with a lot of good moments and tension building in the very best way possible. The acting is top class, all the kids show their talents in acting and that is one of the things I respect the most. 7-8/10 for me.",7,0,0,27 January 2018
Memento," In my all time TOP 20.
","This movie easily rolls into my all time TOP 20 movies list. It is so engaging,so thought-provoking that it makes you wanna watch it again, just so you can experience everything the movie throws at you second hand. I love the main character as he fits the roll perfectly that is given to him, honestly, they could not find a better actor for the role. The semi villains are all very good with a backstory of their own which you have to unlock it yourself while watching. The ending is also very open, which lets you create an alternate ending that eventually fits your point of view, altho you particularly know what the real situation was. 8/10",8,0,1,28 October 2019
Captain Marvel," Very overrated character which should have had a better origin movie than this to survive.
","I did not like Captain Marvel from the start so I was already pessimistic when I started watching the movie. In the end, I was right because if this movie was not a movie released by the MCU, it would not have had an IMDB Rating of more than 7, but completely the opposite, it would be a laughing stock. The movie is lazy and forced, it is just not done right, everything feels rushed and empty, she acts way more arrogant and chill at the same time than she should be, the script writting is awful. the dialog is nothing special, the villains are also very forgettable, but in the end, we all knew it was a bad casting choice when we saw Brie Larson and the movie was doomed to be bad, but not to fail, cause it is an MCU movie.",6,3,6,2 May 2019
Iron Man 2," Liked it, but still the first one is way better.
","By now, I've watched 2 Iron Man movies and neither of them dissapointed me. Both of them had their own qualities, their own originality and story, BUT, I must admit that the sequel kind of faded very quickly at the end, and by that, most of all, I am thinking about the russian anti-hero. I liked how the story about the antagonist managed to blend well with the story about Toni's father, I liked the design of the weapons the russian dude used, but the final fight where both Toni and Rhodes went in battle against Ivan Vanko was blank, empty and short. Nothing spectacular happened and the fight was 10 seconds long, altho we were waiting for a grand final ending where Ivan would finally show his upgraded super-weapon. Still, R.J. is one hell of an actor who can save anything, even a bad Iron Man ending, as his charm and charizma manage to deliver another great Iron Man movie.",7,0,0,2 June 2018
The Impossible," Heartbreaking.
","I can't believe this can happen to over 270 000 people. It is sad, it is devastating, it is terrifying, it is brutal and heartbraking. The movie director could not made this look any more real and make us feel like we were there. The sound effects are amazing and the visuals are out of this world, with the tsunami scenes being over the top outstanding. Tom Holland manages to put the performance of his life, even tho he is only 13-14 year old when the movie was released. The casting roles were chosen very carefully without a single mistake being made. The ending at least is heartwarming and happy, even tho it is one of the most tragical catastrophies that the world has ever faced.",7,2,3,17 March 2019
Shaun of the Dead," So much better than At the World'S End.
","The first movie I watched from this trilogy was the last one, At the World's End, and I must say that this one is by far better(I am still yet to watch Hot Fuzz). Both Simon and Nick are doing their job better than ever in this hilarious survival ride, showing their pros and negatives. The only thing I did not expect was the fact that this movies are not directly related one to another ? I expected them to be a direct sequel one to another, but that is not the case here. Anyway, be sure to watch them one after another, as you will watch how the actors grow older without losing their sense for awesomeness and comical acting.",6,0,1,27 October 2018
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," A movie to remember.
","Altho I hate Oscars mostly because of the winners, in this case, the Oscar rightfully belongs to this masterpiece. It is child friendly, but at the same moment, it is mature and it is one of the best movies to watch with your family on a Christmas Eve after a nice dinner.",8,0,0,23 December 2017
Us," Good, but nowhere near the quality of Get Out.
","Right from the get go you can see that this is a Jordan Peele movie, everything somehow feels 'his way'. The movie has great character introduction, awesome villains, if you can define them like villains, the horror is there, but in normal measures, a great build up and a cool ending twist that surprised me a lot, to be honest, I was never expecting that and it made the movie way much better. If it wasn't for that twist in the end, I would not rate this movie high, it was way to much slow at some points, there were unnecessary scenes and some typical horror movie scenes that were not part of the Jordan Peele movie style to which we were introduced before. 7/10",7,0,2,11 June 2019
Oldboy," The original is always better than the sequel.
","Altho I can't say that I did not like the american remake as much as this one, still, you can feel the originality in this masterpiece. Also it is obvious how Hollywood adapted the movie for wider audience, since this movie has 10 times more gore, sexuality and R rated scenes that are some points are hard to be watched. Still, the movie would not be even half of what it is without those scenes. The only negative aspect for me was the slow-tempo building which makes the movie a bit boring at some moments, that was not the case in the remake. All in all, a crazy psycho story that will bust you out of your shoes, great typical asian acting and a brutal ending. 8/10",8,1,3,14 March 2018
Batman Returns," Even better than the first original Batman (1989).
","Maybe I will go a bit to far, but this movie, for me, is even better than it's predecessor. Yes, in the first movie Jack Nicholson's Joker is outstanding, his role is beyond great, he is the icon of the movie, but still, nothing is darker than this sequel. Here we have more than one main bad guy, we have The Penguin, The Catwoman and also Shrek, the businessman. The Penguin played by Danny DeVito is something else, it is beyond good, it is something that can never be replayed. The costume work done both for The Penguin and The Catwoman is pure art. What can I say about the Catwoman played by Michelle Pfeifer ? The best female semi anti-hero ever played on the movie screens ? She does everything in this movie with a feeling of crazyness, power and emotion, all three at the same time. There is nothing do discuss about Michael Keaton as Batman, he has already proven himself in the first movie, altho he is even better and a more complete character in this sequel. Also the city is once again beautiful, dark, gothic, cold and full with criminals, one of the most beautiful aspects of the movie. 8/10",8,1,21,30 April 2018
Spotlight," A movie that shows how twisted and sick the society really is.
","Since I am studying journalism, our professor showed us this movie during our class and I am happy she did so, since I felt ashamed that I did not know this movie until then. It shows how hard, dedicated and loved journalism as profession really is and at the same time, it shows the truth that hides behind the curtain. There is a reason why journalism and journalists are called the 7th power of society, and this movie is a clear proof about that. It reminds people once again that they need to be careful with their surroundings, even when the church is the subject of matter.",7,0,1,6 March 2018
The Day After Tomorrow," I just love apocalypse based movies.
","There is nothing better to watch than a crazy apocalypse based movie where you can see visual effects and CGI in all of their glory with your mouth left wide open. This is by far one of the most unic movies I've watched, especially because of the fact that the reason for the apocalyptic setting is a climate change, but a climate change where everything freezes with temperatures below -150. Nowadays, all we talk is about global warming, hot weather, warm winters, but this movie is something totally different from that, the complete opposite. Yes, the moment when Jake Gyllenhaal is pursued from one city to another by has father, while the whole world is crumbling is a bit to much, but hey, as long is Jake Gyllenhaal is the one we need to worry about, everything is alright, who by the way, does an awesome acting job, altho, at that time, is only 23 years old.",7,0,0,2 June 2018
Deadpool 2," Hilarious aftercredits.
","The movie is worth it from the aftercredits alone. The things you will see in the aftercredits are totally crazy and hilarious, you would expect such thing from no matter what movie it is, but I guess with Deadpool it is a different story. The movie overall is in the same rank as the first one, altho this one felt more like an episode than like a film. The jokes were amazing, this time Ryan really outdone himself and he will keep you up until the very end. The apperance of Cable is something I really liked and I expect to see more from him in the future because he really fits the MCU, I am not into comics, but I am sure he is a character in the comics. All in all 7/10",7,0,1,2 December 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," I cringed at first, but then I got on with it.
","As the movie started and as I saw the first scene, I thought, this is so not Thor-like, I hate overreacted humour, this will make me cringe throughout the whole movie. BUT, it was not the case, yes, I did not like the humour moments, well most of them, but all in all, this is, if not, the best Thor movie out of the trio. Visually, it surpassed all expectations, it is astonishing, especially the last 30 minutes of the movie. Storywise, it is unic, different, modern and epic at the same time, Thor and Loki show how big of a chemistry they have between them and why we love Loki, even tho he is a bad guy overall.",7,1,4,24 December 2018
Sleepy Hollow," This is why movies should be consideres a serious piece of art.
","From Tim Burton, to Johny Depp, this movie has the purest artistic value that a movie can have. It is so smooth, with a beautiful paced storytelling, enjoyable, entertaining, scary by using the hack and slash bloody gore formula, with beautiful visuals, an amazing gothic atmosphere, lovable characters, all packed up in one hell of a movie which was way ahead of it's time. Watching it now, I did not realize and I would never guess this is a 20 year old movie. Amazing.",7,0,0,12 December 2018
Ready Player One," Wrong making method destroyed the movie for me.
","A lot of things collide in the movie which makes me nervous and angry while watching it. I would love to see it at least one more time because of just one thing and that is the references that were spilled all over the movie. They are just wonderful and amazing and heartwarming, especially for the older viewers who would find all of the 80's and 90's movie and video games references exciting. But there is also the problem. The movie is not made for older viewers since it is full with cringy childish jokes, teenage love romance moments and overall scenario that collides with the references. Not a single 14 year old would understand every reference that was put in the movie, even tho there was a reference from 'The Shining' that lasted more than 5 minutes. Steven made the biggest mistake here in my eyes and I blame him for that because I can guarantee that those references were not there in the original book. So if he wanted the references in, he should've put the childish lore out.",6,0,0,15 March 2019
The Hateful Eight," Still not a huge fan of Tarantino's movies.
","I know that there is something special about Tarantino's movies and I can feel it to without a doubt, the way they are filmed and the atmosphere really stand out, but overall his movies are way to monotone and slow for my taste. The way things unfold is not satisfying in any way possible and apart from a lot of gore and blood, I say nothing special of a plot, expect a simple short story dragged for 3 hours.",6,2,6,6 May 2020
Snatch," Fight Club, Seven and THIS.
","This, along with Fight Club and Seven, are maybe the best roles that Brad Pitt played. The movie is pitch perfect. Simple story, great acting, good sense of humour, Jason Statham being the actor he is and the movie is a 9/10 at least.",9,1,3,23 December 2017
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Not the Spider-Man we love, but the Spider-Man we need.
","In all honesty, we all fell in love with the character that Toby built around Spider-Man, but in reality, that is not how the Spider-Man from the comics should be like. This is what he should act and look like and Tom Holland manages to make us see that on screen perfectly. The Vulture is also amazing because Michael Keaton is a movie legend and we had no doubt that anyway, but Tom Holland is the most positive surprise that MCU could've come up with. He is amazing in every way, the perfect kid to do the Spider-Man role. The movie is entertaining, it does not get boring for one second and keeps going with a fast pace all the way till the end.",8,0,1,1 February 2019
Suicide Squad," Jared Leto ruins the show.
","I admit, there were some poor director choices that made the movie worse that it could have been, there were scenes that could have been done better and a more interesting ending...BUT, Jared Leto did not manage to fill the shoes of Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger at all. He ruined the most memorable and unique character that DC has in store by acting so damn artificial it made me wanna puke. He was very poor, that laugh was miserable and he did not succeed in pulling the characteristic Joker Face Changer for once. Anyway, his lines were also awful, but that is the director's problem and it shows us how a great movie potential can be wasted by making some very important wrong moves.",6,0,0,11 June 2019
Shutter Island," Leonardo DiCaprio, salute you soldier.
","Leonardo is one of the best, if not, maybe the best actors this 21th century has ever seen. His range of roleplay is beyond limit. He dwells so deep into his acting roles that he lives with them, he becomes one with the story. He deserved an Oscar so much, that people disliked the fact that he got one with the Revenant, but in fact, that Oscar was won because of all his previous masterpieces, it was a long waited and deserved victory. This movie is something else, it is beyond your average movie and beyond the average plot twist. It plays with your mind the way his mind plays on Leonardo in the movie. The story is phenomenal, it is beyond beautiful, but the ending... oh, how good that ending was, those last 20 seconds. 9/10",9,1,1,4 April 2018
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Among the best.
","Captain America: The Winter Soldier is probably in the TOP 3 MCU movies, especially in the last few years. It shines bright with all of the characters involved, the chemistry between Rogers and Natasha, the involvment than Nick Fury had in the movie, the villain that is the Winter Soldier, Falcon was also awesome and pretty much involved throughout the whole movie. The return of Hydra was something I did not expect since I am not a fan of the comics and I don't know what to expect, but man, was the think with that Zola AI cool as hell. I wonder what would it be if he(it) was just a bit more involved and had more screen time. The movie is around two and a half hours long and it doesn't ever get boring. I also loved the elevator scene and the chase involving Nick Fury and that awesome car of his.",8,0,0,16 January 2019
Doctor Strange," Slightly dissapointed.
","I love MCU, I love the comic book characters and the movies are really awesome alongside the amazing arc that they follow, but all in all, we all know that very often MCU movies are likely to be overhyped. That is the case with this movie. Yes, maybe I am bit late and the hype was understandable and bigger back then, but still, this is a mediocre movie with awesome visuals. The world shifting scenes are out of this world, they are absolutely amazing and I can bet the cost a lot of money, also the cast is pretty good, with some characters being developed way more than others, but I expected a bit more. The story is pretty basic, nothing special about it, the action sequences are like a part from a TV Show, you expect them to have a different conclusion that will happen further in the future. All in all, for me, this movie feels more like an episode without a concrete conclusion than a whole 2 hour movie. 6/10",6,1,1,21 February 2019
"Monsters, Inc."," A legendary animated movie that will be living on with years to come.
","An amazing animated movie that gained a legendary status throughout the years based on it's phenomenal idea that one of the most innovative things we've seen told in an animated movie in a while, plus a truly remarkable animations and visuals, not seen till the period it came out, 2001 to be exact. The voice acting is fantastic since the characters are voiced by movie legends, the ending is suitable for a family movie where you expect a happy ending that ads up to the joy of fun and happiness provoked by this gem.",7,0,0,26 December 2019
Ant-Man," Way better than I expected.
","The movie starts very slow and that is why I believe many gave up on it before it got interesting and took pace. The first 20 minutes are boring and way longer than they need to be, but I guess that is the main and only issue. Otherwise, the casting chosen for the movie fits the bill perfectly, Paul Rudd fits so well with the other Marvel superheroes and Avengers that is astonishing how well they know who to choose to play their heroes. I always liked Michael Douglas and I was so happy when I saw him here cause right away I knew he was going to play an important role. Lilly is a well known actor from her days with Lost and many other movies so it was a no brainer to be aware of her acting capability. The CGI was over the top because every time Scott shrinked into The Ant-Man it felt natural, as natural as it can be. Altho it is obvious it is artificial, still it looks so well blended with the real parts of the movie( most of all I likes the interactions that Ant-Man was making with the ants all the time). The antagonist was also great with an awesome looking suit, altho maybe I would like a bit more screen time with fighting(also that fight with Falcon was a very positive surprise)",7,0,1,30 January 2019
The Godfather: Part II," Astonishing.
","This is without a doubt one of the most flawlessly made movies ever. You rarely get to see a movie longer than 3 hours that does not have a boring slow-paced part, but that is the case here. This is one of the most amazing movies ever made, from the setting, the acting, the costumes, the vehicles, the action sequences, the story, the emotions, absolutely everything. Many say Al Pacino is generic since he can act only as a mobster, but did they ever think about if there is someone better? Plus, there is a huge difference in the mafia style in Godfather and Scarface for exaple, a complete opposite, yet, he manages to clinge both rolls. Also, as we see the backroll transition from Marlon Brando to Al Pacino we get even more excited, wondering how many acting legends this ovie has yet to offer? There has never been a bigger, better and more suited anti-hero than that played by Al Pacino in The Godfather franchise.",8,0,0,1 April 2020
Predator," The Predator's design is awesome.
","When you watch this movie, it is obvious it's at least 30 years old, but on the other hand, it offers a lot of stealth action, tension and drama, things that many movies lack today. I must admit that the movie has a bit to slow pace for my taste, but at the end the fight sequences between Arnold and the Predator, who by the way, looks sick without the mask, made this movie what it is today. Of course, a lot of macho moments, cliche quotes and all of that, but it is from the 80's when all of that was awesome anyway.",6,1,2,8 June 2018
Oblivion," Creating it's own genre.
","An amazing movie with amazing acting and georgous scenery and visual effects. The plot is truly mesmerizing once you get in pace with it, even tho it can get confusing at times, altho the confusion is a sweet one in this case, because you know you are watching something truly great. The ending may be bitter and sad for many, but it stoll gut a great finale with something to look forward to, if you are one of those 'get touchy and close with the characters'. Big piece of art.",8,0,0,5 June 2020
Bird Box," Underwhelming overhyped movie.
","Yes, it is obvious that there was a lot of work put in this movie, the acting is phenomenal, the production is on point, everything about how the movie looks is flawless, but other than that, the movie has dozens of holes that need to be filled to make the movie meaningful just one bit. What happened to Felix and Lucy ? What are the monsters ? How will the blind people survive ? Where will they get food from ? I can count more than 15 questions without that can't be answered..maybe a sequel would give the answers people are seeking. Until then, this movie is nothing more than a meme.",6,1,3,1 February 2019
Justice League," Slightly dissapointed.
","To be honest, I've always favoured DCU over Marvel CU, but this movie is dissapointing. With a budget of 300 million $ they could've done so much more because the movie feels blank, lacking content, lacking environment, lacking character introduction, it lacks everything. When you compare the visual effects and the CGI with the budget, you must admit it is crap, it is over animated and to vivid. Batman does almost nothing throughout the whole movie and yes. Superman is overpowered, but alongside him, they made the other heroes look like they mean nothing.",6,1,17,4 January 2019
Split," An Oscar worthy performance by James McAvoy.
","If somebody else filled James McAvoy's shoes in this psychological ride, and by somebody else I mean a mainstream actor that has already gathered wider audience and maybe an Oscar in his prime, that person would've won an Oscar for this role. James McAvoy's with this movie went right into my top 10 actors of all time, yes, with just one movie. I could not believe how good his acting was, the way he managed so perfectly to change his personalities, the way he was acting crazy and lost, it was pure art. The plot was also amazing, altho I was a bit dissapointed with the ending, but a sequel is coming next year, so no worries.",7,0,1,5 May 2018
Knowing," Not the ending I expected.
","The movies in which Cage is starring are hit or miss, they are either spectacular or pretty weird. This movie had one of the best build ups I have ever seen in a movie from this genre, but failed to impress me with it's shallow ending that I did not see fit the whole scenario. Altho it is logical for the movie to end in that kind of a way, still, I expected a lot more, since the build up was amazing, the tension building and the visuals were outstanding and the key moments were all leading to a huge conclusion that did not happen in the end..",5,2,2,16 September 2019
The Shining," An Unique Experience.
","An unique experience with a horror movie that you will never ever experience again, only for the reason that horror movies like that are not made nowadays which is sad really, since that genre feels dead a long time ago. Jack's acting is the performance of his lifetime, alongside a lot more roles we've seen him dig his way into. The suspense,tension,horror and psychological mess that this movie makes you feel is something that can be achieved only by a movie based on a book. and by this I mean a book by Stephen King x). It is obvious why it got a cult following throughout the years, more like decades and is a legendary movie that will not be forgotten in the 21 century at least.",7,0,1,7 October 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," No space for competition here.
","The best piece of art that was made in 2018 and among the best in the 21 century. It is understandable why they needed 4 years to create this eye watering beautifulness. I just can't believe how amazing this animated movie is, the combination of 3D and 2D animation along with moderately used CGI is the best formula that will be used by many others in the future, I can guarantee it. The story is beautiful and full with amazing characters that complement each other all the time, nothing feels to rushed or to long and boring. It has a very interesting ending, altho my only issue would be the fact that I wanted a bit more action seen from the heroes that come from the other universes. That would be my verdict.",9,1,2,6 March 2019
Collateral," Directoring perfection.
","This movie is a true directoring perfection. I don't know how I haven't watched this gorgeous masterpiece until now, but as soon as I saw the first few scenes I told my girlfriend, this movie will be amazing...and it really was. Every camera angle has been caught with such devotion, precision and perfection that it makes it inpossible to unsee it. Tom Cruise plays maybe his best role of all time, especially as a villain, Vincent is a truly unique character. Jamie Fox nails it as the taxi driver who's live gets flipped upside down in a matter of hours during a night shift+that Transporter easter egg with Jason Statham was really surprising and satisfying",7,0,1,5 July 2019
The Amazing Spider-Man," Andrew Garfield doesn't make the cut for me.
","The movie is good, a worthy successor to the Sam Raimi's Spider-Man movies, but Andrew Garfield is nowhere near as good as Tobey Maguire. He just doesn't fill in the role for me and that is a personal opinion that I am willing to stay behind. Emma Stone played her role perfectly, I was always amazed by her acting and she prooved me here once more of her capabilities. Other than that, I feel like the movie needed another antagonist, an anti-hero right next to 'The Lizard', just like things were going on in the first 3 Spider-Man movies. I don't know, maybe is just nostalgia hitting me, but yes, I think that the movie overall is quality, but not as good as Sam Raimi's.",7,0,2,13 January 2019
Captain America: Civil War," The best MCU movie of them all.
","Without a doubt, by far the best MCU movie of all time and Marvel overall. An amazing CLASH of the titans, where everyone fights everyone, no one believes no one, but everything is fighting for a cause in which they believe in. The Avengers divide over a serious political debate which tears them apart into two seperate sections of the Avengers, one led by C.A. and the other by Iron Man. Every superhero gives his best in this movie to proove his worth and specialty as a Marvel Comic character and that is why it is so special. Alone the fact that this movie doesn't need a real villain to be good prooves by point first hand. The Spider-Man apperance was beautiful and so perfectly timed that it feels more natural than any situation in which we've seen Peter. He is obviously a young kid, but a kid aware of the dangerousness of being a hero so small amongst the real giants like C.A. or Scarlet Witch. This is the perfect MCU movie.",9,0,1,6 February 2019
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Completely independent from the Harry Potter saga with a single small connection to put them in the same universe.
","Because of the fact that I've only watched the Harry Potter saga and not read the books, I was completely unaware of the fact that this book was written by J.K. a long time ago as part of the Potter Universe. Nonetheless, I was pretty impressed by the imagination behind the looks of the creatures and overall how the city and everything looked, suggesting that the ideas were taken from the book of course. However, even tho the visuals were outstanding throughout the whole movie, especially in the climax, I was underwhelmed by the main character and his stiffness, boring nature and irritable tone of speaking which could not be heard even when I turned up the volume on my TV way higher. The supporting characters were also pretty pale, aside from Dan Fogler as Jacob who was an outstanding supportive role. The plot is simple, but engaging, even tho it can be pretty slow for some viewers. The villain played by Collin Farrel was also dissapointing, I guess his personality did not fit the character's shoes and that is why he was not the person to be chosen for the role in my eyes. All in all, 6/10",6,0,0,29 January 2020
The Conjuring 2," Creating a sequel better than it's predecessor is one hell of a job to do.
","I am confident to say that this movie is even better than the first one, and we all know how good the first one was. Yes, this movie maybe relies more on jump scares and yes, the first one was revolutionary, but this one offers few crazy horror characters at the same time that make the atmosphere even more wild. I loved how 'The Nun' looked and the scenes where she was involved are maybe the best scenes in the movie, so I can't wait to see that sequel. We again see some awesome acting and well built relationship between the 2 main protagonists who make for an awesome couple that drives the movie from 1 to the 5th gear.",8,0,0,25 April 2018
The Usual Suspects," TOP 10 of all time.
","Enjoy every single moment of this amazing piece of art like it is the only movie you'll ever see. That way you will unlock maybe many things that will get clear at the end. Also, the ending will blow your mind, literally. One of the best movies of the 20th century, the 21st isn't even worth mentioning.",8,0,3,30 December 2019
Resident Evil," Decent Game/Movie adaptation.
","Altho not following the game in every aspect, which is a GOOD THING, it still manages to relate to the game in a lot of ways, all while keeping it's identity. Greatly chosen cast, all worth the while, with pretty solid visuals for the period of time, including CGI of course. Great costumes also by the way!",6,3,3,12 April 2020
Avengers: Endgame," Beautiful ending to an amazing story in which we took part for the last 10 years.
","It's amazing how I do not feel sad that this franchise finally came to an end, I guess I am satisfied with the way it ended, maybe it was the only right way..I was surprised that not many characters actually died in the movie, apart from Black Widow and Iron Man, Gamora is alive and well, that was confirmed by the directors and Loki obviously is going to alternate his future with him running with the tesseract. Captain America had the best possible ending, altho I expected that Barnes will be the next Captain America, since he is also a super soldier, but later on I found out that Sam was the one in the comics also, so no hard feelings. The first half an hour were average to say at least, but you can't expect action all the time in a 3 hour movie. The ending battle was breathtaking and it was worth it all the wait. Pepper's costume made by Stark was out of this world, I would really wish a stand alone film featuring Pepper continuing the legacy of our beloved Iron Man.",8,0,4,2 May 2019
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Genre defining movies.
","Amazing. Who would've thought that 10 years later, the movies and the story will conitue in similar fashion, with the most amazing visual effects possible. Altho with a brighter tone because of the different approach to the story as it is, this trilogy was beautiful, and to start it off with a movie as good as this one is the perfect way to go. The biggest plus for me is the length. I hoped that the movies will continue being 3 hours long and this movie is almost 3 hours long which is awesome for my binging desires :D All in all, a great movie led by the greatest actor they could've chosen for the role of Bildo, the amazing, always positive and kind, Martin Freeman.",8,0,1,23 April 2020
Avengers: Infinity War," Up there, shoulder to shoulder with Captain America-Civil War
","Arguably, the best MCU movie ever made, and yes, I watched Endgame. Many people say Infinity War is the action and Endgame is the brain and I agree totally with that, but in Endgame there are many things that can be questioned, the decisions, things that did not make sense, things that can't be explained, some rushed choices and many more. But Infinity War is perfect, it is balanced, it is well written, it is action-packed and the most important thing, it never gets boring, not for a single second. There is always something happening, something big and exciting, heart pounding and stressful. There is happiness and there is grief, there is team work and there is power. Incredible re-introduction of all the characters that we've seen throughout the MCU journey with some of the most amazing visuals and CGI effects ever seen in the movie theaters.",9,1,1,2 May 2019
Get Out," One of the best movies I've ever watched.
","THIS. MOVIE. IS. SOMETHING. ELSE. This masterpiece feels so indie, yet, it is one of the greatest cinematic artworks I have watched in my entire life. The story is so unique, the build up is so in place, there is not a moment of cringe horror acting, the characters all act logicaly like anybody would act in that kind of a situation, especially the main character. I don't know who he is, but from now on, he is in my top 10 actors, altho this is the only movie I've watched him in. Throughout the whole movie, there is this feeling of creepiness and tension which leaves you at the edge of your seat, especially at the end where you get to know and understand it all. It is not a horror, it is not a thriller, it is not a mistery, it is everything combined, but none of these alone. I don't know , maybe the director invented a new genre.",9,14,27,27 January 2018
Aladdin," An amazing faith, yet original interpretation.
","This movie took everyone by storm, since the haters started hating before they even saw it. Full of all the negativity Disney has accumulated with the live-action adaptations, nobody expected a movie as good as this one. Will Smith is and always be one of the most multi-talented actors of all time, his presence in this movie is as immersive as it can get, knowing how to act funny, serious, wise and sad at the same time. I enjoyed all the actors pretty much, apart from Jafar who might have been a bit more evil for my taste, but hey, it is a movie for younger views for starters, so I don't mind it. Altho I hate musicals, I never got bored by listeting this beautiful jems, especially that one when Prince Alli enters the kingdom with that colorful spectacle. 8/10 in every aspect.",8,0,2,31 August 2019
2012," So much lost potential.
","This movie had the potential to be one of the greatest, if maybe not , the greatest apocalyptic movie of all time. It had all the prepositions, especially the story it was based on, since everyone in that period of time was starting to worry about the D-day and what the Mayans said about the year 2012- the year when the world and our existence would be destroyed. It had a huge budget, the visuals were meant to be and are AMAZING, crazy good, as I would like to say eye-watering, BUT, at some moments, they were used to much, almost every 3 minutes which led to the movie losing depth, losing rhythm, losing logic. The casting choice was also mistaken pretty bad, especially with the leading role John Cusack, who, altho is one of the finest actors, brought to much comedy, without taking any matter seriously, which is not logical at any means, since the ground below him is dissapearing while he is making jokes about it.",6,2,3,2 June 2018
A Quiet Place," This is what talent and ability to create looks like.
","With a budget of less then 20 million dollars, you manage to make a movie that made over 300 million dollars. AND YET, some try to deny the quality of the movie and given effort, saying the movie has many questions left unanswered and is mediocre. You can't get any more miserable, than that, can you ? The guy created a movie in which he acted maybe the most important figure with such passion and sensitivity, he made a movie long enough to be full with tension and not get boring for a single second that blasts you with a tragedy in the first 2 minutes, takes his wife from his private life, makes her his wife in the movie and gives her the main role in the plot and their chemistry flows instantly right away. The children act undoubtedly amazing and have tons of talent, especially the little guy. And at last, the monsters look amazing, especially with how their heads look, altho they pretty much remind me of the Demogorgon from Stranger Things.",7,0,1,9 February 2019
Unknown," Liam classic.
","Another one in the collection of Liam Neeson movies that many would fail to distinguish, but yet, would still watch every single one of them again if they can, since all of his movies are action packed and fun to watch. This one also has a pretty good plot that evolves in ways you would not expect, plus the action takes place in Europe, which makes it even more fun. An interesting ending to say the least, lefting us craving for more Neeson action in his next movie.",7,0,0,5 June 2020
Million Dollar Baby," Heartbraking.
","I can't say that I loved the movie, but I liked it. Throughout the movie I felt like the girl was a bit to forced with the acting, it didn't seem natural to me, somehow I couldn't feel with her. But as the movie went on, you slowly grow with the character, all the way until the end where the story comes to a heartbraking finish and leaves you in tears. Clint and Morgan were top class, as always, one of the best roles they played and one of the best movies Clint Eastwood made.",8,1,2,9 January 2018
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Good portration of Racoon City.
","I felt like the forte of the movie was the environment setting throughout the whole movie, especially while the main characters walk the soulless streets full with zombies. It reminded me of the game much more than the first movie, also letting us to see The Nemesis for the first time, even tho they made him a lot Terminator like, which I did not like. Anyway, a decent movie resembling the games which caught the gaming world by surprise in the late 90's.",6,2,2,12 April 2020
Guardians of the Galaxy," Very warm, fun and joyful movie to watch.
","Altho I am not a person that likes jokes and comedy movies, I pretty much liked everything that was laughable in this movie and that says how good it is. Nothing in this movie is forced, everything is going on so smoothly, with a positive and fun atmosphere, but emotional and sad at periods in the same time. All the protagonists have deeply worked characters with a special bond and chemistry between them, all united for the same reason against the same villain. The visuals are over the top, maybe some of the best I've ever seen with a beatufiul sci-fi city environment and a beautiful galaxy. To be real, the story is a bit blank, it is nothing special, but it goes according to the comics, so no hard feelings there.",7,1,2,4 May 2018
8 Mile," Brilliant.
","This guy is something else, a true born talent, but a talent that prooved his worth by working hard day and night. He is the best rapper of all time, no one can deny me that and above that, to win an Oscar ? Rapper,producer,actor, what else ? GOD. Altho this movie is amazing and is making us relive some of the hardest moment he went through in his devastating young life, I still think that if the circumstances were different, it would not be an Oscar winner. Anyway, he deserves every moment of his glory and awards because he is an amazing human being who does not know when it is enough of success and achievment.",7,0,2,30 January 2019
From Dusk Till Dawn," Chill movie that should not and can not be taken seriously.
","We have one of the all time world's best actors (Clooney) and one of the all time world's best directors (Tarantino) acting all crazy and mean in a fun comedy horror zombie world where everything can happen. A fun story, over the top acting, great scenery, awesome looking zombies and vampires, and for the year it came out, it is one hell of a gem.",6,0,2,26 April 2018
Avengers: Age of Ultron," I've seen beter MCU movies.
","All of us have seen better MCU movies, this movie is not a dissapointment, but it did not deliver as well as everyone expected, the rating does not say so, but the critics do. Altho I liked the fact that in some way, Captain America took the spotlight, still the antagonist that I've seen in Ultron is not enough for me to rate this movie as high as I expected before I saw the movie. I did not like Ultron at all, he was acting to formal in many situations, often comical without need, the CGI used on him was too much and somehow he lacked an identity for me. On the other hand, Vision looked weird, but I guess that is what he looks like according to the comics, but acted nicely, kept his promise when the world needed those kind of words the most, altho he was also a bit to much formal at times. Oh, and yes, how did that discount Flash guy died and nobody mentioned him afterwards until the end ?",6,1,4,22 January 2019
Hotel Transylvania," The rebirth of Adam Sandler.
","Why this wasn't the rebirth of Adam Sandler's career ? I love him, he is such a funny and warm actor and he shows it again here, even tho we don't see him in live action, but only his voice. He portraits Dracula in an amazing and heart warming way. A beautiful animated movie to watch with your family and friends, relaxing and fun with a interesting story and some amazing character drawings.
Can't wait to see 2 and 3 !",8,0,1,28 November 2018
Drag Me to Hell," Is this supposed to be a parody of the horror movies ?
","Maybe I am wrong, maybe I do not understand the concept and work that this director is into, but in my opinion, this is by far one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen. At least they should put horror,COMEDY, thriller. The animations and visual effects were so bad and hilarious it made me want to vomit. The acting was so bad, from both the awful female and the male in the couple, that I don't understand how this even past the test audience. Stupid jump scares, miserable visual and unlogical effects, horrible acting. 3/10",3,1,2,22 March 2018
Mama," That ending ruined it all.
","I was scared and pretty okay with the movie until the ending come. The acting was all good, especially the kids, there were not that much stupid horror movie decisions, but all of that fell in the water when the ending came. That animation was so bad it made me laugh, the whole 10 min. scene was so bad it destroyed everything the movie built... 5/10",5,2,3,31 January 2018
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Nice beginning to an amazing saga
","The right way to start a saga like this one, introducing the characters in a very positive and unique way, telling and showcasing all the riches that the wizard's world is a home of. In only one movie, we've seen amazing creatures, friendly and foes, teachers that are heroes and villains, we've witnessed the wisdom of the legendary professor Dumbldor, the movie made us guess who will be who and on who's side in the chapters to come and above all, we had fun. I will never forget the part where Harry buys all the things he needs to start his wizard journey, the authentic look of the streets, the shops and the bank will be part of the Harry Potter legacy forever.",7,1,1,30 August 2019
Thor," Chris Hemsworth is definitely the right man for the plan.
","Without saying to much, this movie is a true example of the work that MCU did in the last decade, the story is apsolutely beautiful, the setting in the galaxy is eye-watering, the characters are likeable, relaxing and fun to watch, Thor is played without a single flaw throughout the whole movie, Chris did an awesome job, and also, Loki (Tom Hiddleston), my oh my, what an actor, what a villain ! Maybe it would be nice if the movie went on for a bit longer, with some more action packed drama, but still, a very good MCU piece.",7,1,1,2 June 2018
War of the Worlds," Among the best Sci-Fi movies.
","The story starts bleak, one that we see very often. A father who is a complete mess, a divorced couple with adolescent children that have their temperament on fire and so on. There is nothing special about the story, all in all, an alien invasion that wants to destroy earth. But as the movie progresses, we can see the work that was put in this movie and the budget that was spent. This movie helds some of the best visual effects I've seen in a Sci-Fi movie, especially taking note for the year it came out (2005). Yes, there are few stupid decisions made, especially by the boy, but all in all, the movie is decent. Tom Cruise is one hell of an actor when action movies like these are in question and he shows in once again.",7,0,1,25 April 2018
Joker," Role of a lifetime for Phoenix.
","Even tho I am aware of the fact that I did not see outside of the box, I am free to express my opinion that I expected a lot more. Despite the fact that Joaqin Phoenix plays the role of his lifetime, being better than ever, one of the best played roles overall in movie history, for me still stands the fact that the pace for many, is killing the flow and expectations of the movie. I enjoyed the first hour or so before I realised that the pace won't change and it got way way to focused on Joker and Joker only and experimented with absolutely nothing outside of the character. The ending was very fitting to the case of the movie which I personally liked, especially the ending sequence, but still, it left me with a half-positive overall impression.",6,0,3,1 February 2020
Edge of Tomorrow," A combination of Source Code and Memento in a way.
","Even tho from first hand I saw that this movie has nothing new, nothing original to give (because of the fact that I've seen the same story idea in Source Code and Memento), I knew it would be good. First of all, no bad movie has a rating of 8 for nothing, second of all, there are some to none bad movies with Tom Cruise and third, can an apocalypse alien invading movie be any bad ? I did not go into this film with full expectations, but my oh my, I was not right at all. This is a blockbuster, an amazing triple A title with over the top CGI, outstanding actor selections and above all, story and emotion.",8,0,1,28 November 2018
It Chapter Two," Could've been better.
","The first one was way better than this sequel, even tho it was the same case with the originals back in the 90's. The length of more than two and a half hours was something I really enjoyed and the movie was not boring at all, but I expected way more. The CGI creatures were awful, I don't know if they were meant to be scary or funny to be honest, they reminded me of the Evil Dead style of horror. The Pennywise clown sequence were he finally transforms into the spider was also mediocre, I expected something more, more inovation in his looks and behavior. Overall 6/10 is the best I can give.",6,1,1,8 November 2019
The Green Mile," Rest In Peace, Michael Clarke Duncan, you legend.
","With this movie Tom Hanks proves why he is one of the all time best male actors that shook the world with their abnormal amazing acting roles. Among the TOP 100 IMDB rated movies, he has probably more than 4-5, including The Green Mile, Forest Gump and Saving Private Ryan, Captain Philips was also an amazing movie. But the spotlight in The Green Mile is reserved for Michael Clarke Duncan in the role of John Coffey. Nobody can count the amount of people that this person made cry in the early 2000's. He is the most adoring male human being that showed up on the movie screen in this century, his acting is out of this world and emotions are leaking out of every cell of his body. The fact that the actor died 7 years ago makes everyone 10 times more sad....rest in piece legend. Above all, we must not forget that this is another movie based on a Stephen King novel that succeded big time, which shows why we may consider King as the best novel writer of all time.",8,3,3,6 February 2019
Murder on the Orient Express," Blank as the white wall next to you.
","I expected so much more from this movie, especially when you look at the cast... half of the Hollywood gods are casting a role and still it can't be anymore dissapointing. Why? Because it is blank, it is slow, it is monotone, it is boring, it is simple and most of all, it is trying to much to be an exact copy of the book, which very often does not end up well, cause books can be boring unless you don't wake up your imagination and create your own scenario. I hope we get a better 'Murder on the Orient Express' movie adaptation in the future, because there is so much wasted potential in this one that was not fulfilled.",5,0,0,21 May 2018
The Conjuring," The movie that made a revolution and brought back respect for the horror genre.
","Seeing it again after 5 years, I realize how important this piece of gem is. This movie defines the horror genre and brought back what the horror lost in our 21 century. It is revolutionizing in every way possible, finally a perfectly written and logical horror story with a decent plot, awesome characters and acting, amazing visuals and an amazing build up play. The movie is so great, that even those less than a few jump scares are crazy good unlike that classical cringy approach to jump scare scenes.",7,1,1,25 April 2018
Never Back Down," Brings back memories.
","This one was one my favourite movies in my teenage years. It completely resembles the thoughts that go through a teenager's head, jealousy, anger, self doubt, hate. I would like to label this movie as the modern Karate Kid because it really works that way, only with Martial Arts instead of Karate, plus the violence is way more intense. It really deservers more fame and respect that in got in it's prime, but at least we got a sequel, so that is enough to be happy about it's succes. The actors are all well chosen, especially the main guy and the antagonist who has the most negative face you could see in a negative role. All in all, at least 7/10",7,0,0,18 May 2018
The Woman in Black," Great horror movie performed by a great actor.
","I still don't understand why this movie is labeled as a drama-fantasy movie when it is obviously a clean horror movie. I loved the film. Daniel is one hell of an actor and he showed it again here. The tension building and the atmosphere are over the top with the typical dark british weather. The only thing that I didn't like were some of the typical horror movie scenes, especially the scenes with the dog barking and the moving chair, but still, it is one of the better horror movies I've watched in recent time.",7,0,1,28 February 2018
Vanilla Sky," What a mindblower.
","There is not a single movie that blew my mind more than Vanilla Sky, even after watching it for the second or maybe third time. Until half an hour passed, you understand almost everything that is happening, but then you get lost on purpose, the director wants you to get lost, just like Tom gets lost in his life. He drives you left and right, up and down, your starting to lose your patience with the movie and then, pop, your back in the driving seat again, why ?, because wow, you just understood something, you connected a few puzzling scenes and your feeling confident about the movie again. You feel for Tom, you are feeling sad like all of that is happening to you, not in some movie that already lost you a few times, but managed to get you back in the last moment. The ending explains it all, makes everything so perfectly clear, but many things leave you feeling pointless about the movie now, and that is why I don't like the ending. It is to sci-fi, to unreal and to supernatural to be implemented as an ending for this beauty.. but I guess there was not a better option to end the movie then this one...",7,10,12,10 December 2018
Black Panther," I liked it, but I admit it is a bit overrated.
","Overall, I pretty much liked this movie, altho I admit it is surely overrated. I believe that the reason why it is overrated is because of the fame and glory MCU gets nowadays, but still it is a movie that deserves respect, most of all because of all the different aspects the movie offers. The special effects are all over the movie and they are amazing, altho at some moments they were even to much for my taste. But I honestly expected a bit more from the story, since I had not read anything about the Black Panther from the Marvel comics before. At times, the movie took to long to progress, which made it boring at few points , as the movie is 2h and 15 min. long. I certainly enjoyed 'Bilbo' and Daniel Kaluuya being in this movie which made my day, since I did not see the cast before I started watching the movie and I was positively surprised. 7/10",7,1,2,6 June 2018
Iron Man," The beginning of an era.
","With this movie, Marvel started their riot in the movie industry and they did it the best way possible. Iron Man is the best opening movie that the Marvel Cinematic Universe could have, with the main man played by the best man that could've been chosen, Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man. For the year it came out, the CGI is amazing, it is natural, it is eye watering, it is so real that you forget that the things you see are obviously not real. The suit is unbelievably good, perfectly crafted and designed, also the things Toni Stark can do in his house are amazing. The plot is also amazing, following the comics, with a great cast of actors chosen, especially Iron Man's lady, Gwyneth Paltrow and the main villain, Jeff Bridges.",8,0,1,5 May 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Tottaly nailed it.
","The reason why I love DC more than I love Marvel is because of the fact that there is rarely any humour, the tone is way darker, more serious, more engaging and violent. This movie completely represents what DC is all about. The film lasts something less than 3 hours, it is phenomenal, filled with awesome fights, especially between Batman and Superman, it introduces Wonder Woman in a fashionable way, the story it tells is what people in real life would be concerned about, the visuals are perfect, in comparison to Justice League that came out later, but it is way worse than this movie. The ending scene is also very fitting to the sequels, altho I did not like the fight with the huge monster that much. Lex Luthor was portrayed perfectly and I would like to see him again in some of the upcoming movies.",7,2,3,8 June 2019
Identity," One of the best Psychological movies I've watched in my life.
","This movie jumped right away in my Top 50 movies list. I am a huge fan of mistery movies and psychological thrillers like this one that keep you awake throughout every second of the movie, without blinking. You are always trying to think one step ahead, guessing, trying to make a logical explanation about who might the killer really be, who is who, why is this here and why is this happening here. All of that work your brain did, just so you come to the end and see that it was all for nothing because there is a gigantic plot twist that changes the whole perspective of the movie. This ladies and gents, this is a piece of art. Oh and yes, I really love John Cusack's acting. He is a true talent.",8,1,1,17 February 2018
Thor: The Dark World," Mediocre at best.
","Altho I like the MCU pretty much, it is obviously a fact that very often Marvel movies can get pretty easily overrated, which is the case with this Thor sequel. It is nowhere as good as the first one, it is empty, blank with little to show for, very little character development, especially for the antagonist from the Dark Elves, nothing spectacular happens in full 2 hours, expect for one fight that occurs on the planet of the Dark Elves and it is short. All in all, it feels more like an episode, than a whole movie which is the problem with me. Once you have the glory, it is easy to sneak some mediocre movie from time to time based on the success of the previous entries. 6/10",6,1,1,20 December 2018
Lucy," Mediocre at best.
","Nothing special to say about this movie. It just lost it's tracks as the movie went on, it became too much unreal, too much confusing, unlogical, delusional. As some other reviewer said before me, Limitless dealt way better with this idea than Lucy did. I liked the concept, but in this case it was badly executed.",6,2,5,4 April 2018
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," An amazing ending to the saga.
","Altho LOTR is by far my favorite fantasy franchise, still, HP manages to get itself very near it it terms of movie quality and story channeling. This grand finale manages to unravel everything that the movies were building up to in spectacular fashion with amazing battles and visuals that modern movie makers can only dream of. My only critic is that Snape and Albus died to suddenly and quickly without a longer introduction and prepareness. All in all, 8/10",8,0,0,2 January 2020
The Purge," The low budget explains it all.
","I love the idea from where this movie started and I loved the acting crew that was chosen, but you can feel how the low 3 mill. budget rips through the promising concept. First of all, I love Ethan Hawke and his acting, all his roles and movies where he contributed and you can feel how he saves this one from a total let down. Second of all, since I experienced Game of Thrones, I realised how good Lena Headey really is and I was expecting a decent performance, which she produced. I must admit that the antagonists where a bit shallow, but still managed to create that 'lunatic and psycho' persona which was the main goal, especially from the main blonde guy. The horror was there, the quality jump scares were there and there was definitely gore. I also liked the plot twist at the end which was a bit expected, but still had a moment of surprise in it. 6-7/10",6,0,1,17 April 2018
Godzilla," I don't where all this hate is coming from.
","Probably, all the people hating this movie are some nostalgic uncles who grew up with the first movies, or with the 1998 Godzilla movie. People don't know how to appreciate.. you can see and feel all the effort and money that were put in the making of this movie, all the casting members, the visual designing team, the work that the producer invested in the film. This movie had an estimated 160 million dollar budget for a reason, the reason are the details. Everything is so perfectly placed and originaly developed. The MUTO creatures, aside from the perfectly accurate looking Godzilla, look phenomenal, unic and beautiful, plus everything looks so real and blends with the environment. 7-8/10",7,1,1,20 April 2018
Deadpool," Ryan is one hell of an actor.
","Without Ryan Reynolds, this movie would not be what it is today. Yes, the Deadpool character from the comics is already a cult legend, but still, there is not a single actor who could outperform Ryan in this role. The fact that he is the same kind of a cool guy in his private life gives the extra taste of dedication to the role he was given. The references to other movies and to himself were also very entertaining, altho I think that maybe just a bit less nudity would be more appropriate, but still. this is Deadpool and that is what he does.",8,2,3,3 March 2018
The Hangover Part III," Good, but seen better.
","I like to think that this movie is good, it made me laugh at some points, the characters acted well and wore the same style they had in the previous 2 parts, but still it is not something great. I think that the first part was way better than this one. I have seen much funnier movies, even though I expected more humour from a Hangover movie. 6/10 7 at best",7,0,0,15 January 2018
Annihilation," This movie requires explanation after seeing it for the first time.
","If you don't search for an explanation on the internet forums after watching this movie, you will probably be left confused without understanding what all of that meant. That was my case exactly, I knew that something was meant to be resembled to, but couldn't guess what. NOW THIS IS A DIRECT AND INFLUENTIAL SPOILER: The whole movie is actually about cancer, about the stages of cancer, about the regrets (Lena cheating on her husband), about the illness and the fact that it's actually not a virus or something similar, but something that is eating you from the inside. Each character is actually diagnosed with cancer (not in a direct way, but the way they deal with the situation in the Shimmer is actually the way people deal with cancer), but it is said that only Ventress has cancer. Some fight it, some face it, but some give up and die without trying. In the end, Ventress hits the last stage of cancer and dies, but Lena fight off the cancer. Now you are having a brainstorm... so check the websites for a better explanation after watching the movie.",6,0,3,17 March 2018
Sin City," Masterpiece.
","As much as drawing comics is a piece of art, that much the same stands for this movie. I was never much into comics, but this made me love them. The visuals, the colour blend, the acting, the actors, the story rotations... just beautiful",8,0,1,23 December 2017
The Cabin in the Woods," Just Crazy.
","This movie is so crazy that is actually great. The concept is so unique and wonderful, never seen in a horror movie before. The ending is so twisted and not expected that left me speechless. I am trully happy I got the chance to watch this movie on TV, cause otherwise I would not have watched it. I love it ! 8/10",8,0,2,17 January 2018
Slumdog Millionaire," One of the most touching and amazing movies I have ever watched.
","In something more than two hours, you see everything that defines India. It is a movie that shows the harsh reality of the world we live in, yet it manages to portray it in a positive way in the end. The fact that partially it is based on something that was a reality makes the feeling even better and shocking. It shows us poverty, it shows us love, determination, greed, hierarchy, dominance, pain, betrayal, family and many other things that define life, and all of that just trough a TV show. I am amazed of the way the movie was directed and served to the audience. The kids also acted amazing which game the movie direction in which it could not have gone wrong in the end. 8/10",8,0,1,18 October 2019
