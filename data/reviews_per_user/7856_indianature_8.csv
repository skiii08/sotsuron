"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Lovely movie with a feel good ending
","I watched Run Fatboy Run on TV this afternoon. I thought it may not hold the interest but there was nothing else to do so I watched. I was so glad I did.This is a beautiful movie. It is about ordinary lives that can rise to extraordinary challenges when the circumstances warrant.Simon Pegg was superb in his portrayal of Dennis, an ordinary unambitious security guard who stood up his pregnant bride Thandie Newton at the altar.Thandie Newton was charming as the stood up bride who moves on with her life.The child actor Dylan did a brilliant job as did Hank Azaria as the typical sophisticated American expat yuppie.The supporting cast of Dylan's friends and the Indian landlord were equally brilliant in the portrayal of their respective characters.At the end of the day, this is a feel good movie with a healthy dose of the human factor that all of us can well relate to.For those who have not seen this already, please do if you get a chance to. It is a must watch.",10,1,2,20 August 2015
Airlift," Good Plot
","Airlift is a story that deserved to be told. It is obviously more interesting for all those who were affected by or had anything to do with the mass exodus of Indians from Kuwait following the Iraqi attack. Not sure if today's youth would find it that interesting.The settings are quite realistic.Akshay Kumar and most of the others barring Nimrat Kaur, did an excellent job. Nimrat Kaur cant act well and her soliloquy in the scene where Akshay is being assaulted by the Iraqi soldier in the desert, was pathetic.That apart, Airlift is certainly worth watching. Especially when it comes on TV :)",8,0,0,2 May 2016
Rang De Basanti," The end spoilt it somewhat
","Rang De Basanti is a brilliantly made movie as one expects from Aamir Khan & co.It has great sets, fantastic cinematography, a good story line etc. etc. etc......Everything was good about it especially the acting.What took away from the overall effect was the ending. The last plot stretched unnecessarily and was far fetched. Till the time they decided to deal with the defence minister and what followed thereafter, it was pretty realistic.Admittedly the final plot was meant to fit in with the story of the freedom fighters that the English girl wanted to tell, but still it sort of spoilt the movie.Nonetheless, Rang De Basanti is a very good film and well worth watching. I had always seen bits of it on TV. Last week I watched the entire film from start to finish.",9,0,2,26 August 2015
Dangal," Superb. As good as Sultan
","DANGAL is a fantastic film. It makes for even better viewing if you watch the real McCoy Phogat sisters with their father on the Kapil Sharma show (available on YouTube). The mother, the younger sisters and the male cousin who was their wrestling partner were also on the Kapil show.It is so good of Aamir Khan to have made this film about the Phogat sisters and their father Mahinder Singh Phogat who defied convention and a conservative society to push his daughters to become world class wrestlers .... okay okay doesn't matter if it was also to satisfy his own ego. Nothing wrong in that.Everything about this film was superb. The acting, the story, the cinematography, the sets, the realism. I loved it and would watch it again for sure.Dangal was as good as Sultan though the former is based on real life and the latter is a fictional depiction. Both were superb films and well worth watching. Thanks to these two movies and the Phogat family episode on the Kapil Sharma show, Indian female wrestling has come into the limelight, and may it stay that way.Do watch this movie if you haven't already.",10,1,2,13 February 2017
M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story," Very interesting watch
","I wasn't sure how this movie would be. In fact it was an excellent watch, holding the interest throughout.Biopics are not necessarily interesting and every celebrity or sportsperson's saga does not necessarily make for a good story. Dhoni's was superbly depicted, even for those who are not always cricket enthusiasts.The story played out well, the acting convinced, the sets were realistic, cinematography superb.The songs could have been avoided but the makers obviously needed to keep commercial interests in mind.All in all, this was a very good film and well worth watching. It is on hot star.",10,0,0,22 March 2017
Sultan," Good movie, worth seeing
","Apart from being a big time box office grosser, Salman Khan's Sultan released appropriately around the time when India's wrestlers won Olympic medals.I saw this film last night when the TV world premiere aired on Sony Max HD. My opinion prior to viewing was that it was probably yet another much hyped box office hit. I was indeed wrong.Sultan is a very good movie with an interesting and human story, superb acting, superb realistic sets and excellent cinematography. Even for those who aren't interested in wrestling. As with Bajrangi Bhaijaan, Salman Khan excelled himself. Anoushka and all the other actors were very good too.The music was pleasing, perhaps one too many songs though having said that, Salman Khan movies aim to give the ticket paying theatre goer full paisa vasool so one cant really grudge the extra song or two. If I had watched this on DVD I perhaps would have fast forwarded the songs. Given the number of ads, the film went on quite late on TV but thats a small price to pay for viewing on a large screen in full HD.All in all this was a very watchable movie, indeed a good movie. Keep it up Salman Khan!",10,1,1,16 October 2016
Parasite," Overrated
","I watched Parasite on Prime Video, expecting it to be an above average film. It really was not.The initial build up was too slow, the story thereafter was interesting but certainly not great cinema. It was just okay. The violence towards the end was too gory.Overall, I found Parasite over rated.",5,3,5,30 March 2020
Rockstar," Beautiful movie - I loved it!
","I have just finished watching Rockstar on TV. Without any expectations I might add, not having heard of it before today.I enjoyed this movie and was engrossed till the end. Ranbir Kapoor put on a superb performance as though the music really was coming from his lovelorn heart and soul. The qawwali scenes in particular, were quite moving. Nargis Fakhri played her role well The story line was enhanced by the performance of the actors. Rahman's music was good, even the rock was melodious and listenable though I am not a fan of rock.The ending was apt, leaving the sad climax unsaid. I do not want to go into the story here as that would spoil the show for anyone who has not seen this yet.This is not a comedy - for those who only watch comedies. It is a human story, sad and dark with several shades of grey.Not suitable for children. Definitely worth a watch for adults.",10,0,0,7 June 2014
