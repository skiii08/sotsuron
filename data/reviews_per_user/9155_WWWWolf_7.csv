The Blair Witch Project," Strictly as fiction? No. Blindly believing the background information? Yes.
","The Blair Witch Project wasn't a bad movie at all, even when it clearly looks like one at first sight.If I'll just take the move and see it as a movie, I probably wouldn't pay for the ticket. But seeing all of the background content (from the web site and so on) and then seeing it again thinking it really would be a documentary from the heart of horror, I can definitely recommend it.It's not a great movie in itself, but if you go to see it and think 'OK, this was what *really* happened', it's a really chilling experience.As many others have commented, you don't need a huge special effects budget to make a chilling horror movie.As far as plot goes, it's not too creative - but the end was satisfyingly suspensive.This movie is best experienced in the middle of the night in the middle of the forest, so go buy a portable TV and VCR. A campfire horror tale for the 2000's! =)",8,0,1,21 May 2000
The Mummy," Strangely interesting
","Much to my surprise, I liked this movie a lot, mostly because it wasn't a movie that gave me weeks of nightmares. More like two nights.In a way, it's more than the sum of its ingredients. The plot is simple and unoriginal (well, it's sort of a remake), the scenes cheesy, the presentation, casting, CGI and even humor is only slightly shiny.Yet, it manages to be thrilling at times, the humor is actually somewhat funny, and it has that Old-Time Adventuring Spirit from Indy's days. It's a horror-action-comedy and it actually manages to do somewhat decently in all three sections. And it was actually watchable a couple of times.All things considered, it was pretty good.",Null,1,2,20 September 2003
The Matrix Revolutions," Epic.
","It had guys in mecha shooting stuff. And a scene of aerial kung fu in thunderstorm - kills most lame anime scenes *dead*. Heck, I'll give 10/10 for this stuff alone!Now that we're done with the unpleasant scoring task, krhm, let's talk of the movie...I immediately liked The Matrix. The Matrix Reloaded was somewhat weirder then - every time I watch it I have the feeling 'man, this *sucked*,' and after a hour or so, 'gee, that was pretty deep, actually'. The Matrix Revolutios, then, is more like this: When I got out of theatre, the first thought was 'these battle scenes were EPIC!', 30 minutes later I was feeling 'was it really that good? I don't think so!' and a hour later, 'okay, I think it was pretty good.'I don't think it's as good as the first movie. The second and third movie *together* are pretty good, and actually pretty tolerable. Like Reloaded, there's good stuff and bad stuff and there's general uneasy feeling to the whole thing - and there are some scenes that could have benefited from some... abridging, without them losing their meaning entirely.As mentioned, there's Epic Effect Stuff and Battle Scenes. No problem, the boys in the Industry can do that stuff well these days. As for how well this integrates with the Matrix stories, or how well it pulls its philosophical sled of rocks, I'm not going to comment, other than that I thought the conclusion was adequate - and I can see why some people are getting angered, because the previous movies subject to interpretation and conclusion may not be as easily interpreted. (I think people start to Debate(tm) soon. It will not necessarily be pleasant.) As such, it may not be everyone's favorite movie. I thought it worked though, and was an adequate end to the series.",10,0,0,6 November 2003
Van Helsing," Mixed bag.
","Well, let me first say that if you expect this to be a Great Movie, stay far away. If you like the old monster movies so much that you worship them, likewise, stay far away. If you just liked the old monster movies a lot, or just like these now-archetypal monsters, by all means, do watch it.As a movie, Van Helsing has a hopelessly basic plot and some of the worst dialogs ever. So, we're by default not talking of a Great Movie. But if you go watching it expecting some campiness, usually predictable action movie humor, and especially these very very cool 3D effects... you'll like it. The movie looks impressive, sounds impressive, and (as a sort of fan of old classics and especially modern effect movies) I found it *satisfactory*.So, in short: Turn brains off for a while and watch it, it's *very* good that way. There's a lot of epic and great stuff. Just don't go watching it expecting it to be a masterpiece of cinema, it just isn't. It's just a very very fun action movie. I liked it.",9,2,4,9 October 2004
Pearl Harbor," *sigh* A huge disappointment
","*MAY HAVE SOME SPOILERS!*WWWWolf presents: Things that bug me.Part 1: It's a Typical Hollywood Love Story(tm). I've seen zillions of these. One more won't be amazing me in a slightest bit. Producer: 'Okay, we're making a Pearl Harbor movie.' Screenwriter: 'Okay...' (proceeds to put the 'Pearl Harbor', 'Two Guys Loving The Same Girl' and 'Patriotic War Imagery' modules in the screenplay writing machine, turns the crank a few times, and the machine e-mails the screenplay directly to the director)Part 2: How many clichés from recent war movies can you *possibly* fit in one movie? Epic dying moments, crankily humorous officers, etcetera etcetera... Not only is it a clichéd love story, it's *also* a clichéd var movie!Part 3: It doesn't end where it should, specifically, after Pearl Harbor. Okay, so there's an American guy who goes a-flyin' and drops some Zeros when they're attacking. I can take that. But if you're going to make a movie about the most humiliating defeat USA has seen in a war, why oh why did they have to specifically continue from there, showing some weird morale-raising military manoeuvers after the whole thing? 'Hey, we got kicked around, but see, we lost a battle but not the war! Aren't we cool?' ... They should have just ended the movie at Admiral Yamamoto's worries about US retaliation, like in that other movie (where even that scene was done far better!).Part 4: I don't know - to me, it didn't *seem* like a WW2 movie. Especially the latter morale-raising part. Strip off the gear and make them a bit more modern, and presto, here we have a *modern* war/action movie. The whole thing seems like a modern action movie thinly disguised as a WW2 movie. Heck, it's a *run-of-the-mill* action movie disguised as a WW2 movie.In conclusion, it bugged me, and there are a lot better movies in the genre.",Null,0,1,3 June 2004
The Matrix Reloaded," Different and same
","I have to confess that when I first saw The Matrix Reloaded I felt cheated and annoyed. Then, I thought about the content a little bit. Then I almost got a headache. Ow.Then again, I had the same feeling with 2001 Space Odyssey. I first thought it was garbage, the second time I saw it it felt far more interesting.I was maybe just shocked because the movie is very different from the predecessor, yet it's more of the same. The Matrix *seemed* like a movie that was wholly self-contained. The sequel doesn't try to explain it, it just challenges it. There's pseudo-philosophical mumbojumbo that's different from the pseudo-philosophical mumbojumbo of the first movie - and it's presented in a different way. There's action and cool kung-fu that's different from action and cool kung-fu of the first movie.I have to say that in the end I'm not disappointed - it's a movie with cool action stuff and things that make you think and spout gibberish about nature of universe and all that. Great material if you like smart movies, good stuff if you want action. It is not without its flaws: some scenes (*ahem*) could have been cut down. The music choices aren't as memorable as in the first part (though the incidental music is still as good).It is, in my own humble opinion, a worthy continuation for The Matrix. It's just very *different* from what I expected. But surprise can be a good thing. And oh yes, I'm definitely waiting for the conclusion.",10,0,0,23 May 2003
The Matrix," Mind-blowing experience
","I had high expectations for this film. People who had seen the movie came out and spoke gibberish about pills and spoons, and reviews painted pictures of extremely nice SF movie with rich philosophical content. And after I saw the trailer, I knew I had to see this movie at all costs. And, I must say, it definitely was worth it.Matrix is, as I mentioned, a mind-blowing experience - you just have to see it to believe it. 'No one can be told what the Matrix is, you have to see it for yourself' - and I might add, no one can guess beforehand what kind of experience the movie is, you *really* have to see it for yourself. Words can hardly describe all of it.",10,0,0,24 September 1999
