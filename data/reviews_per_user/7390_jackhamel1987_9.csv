Vertigo," The very best of Hitchcock.
","Without a doubt, this is Hitchcock's best film. On top of that, I would personally put it in my own top 10 list, because this film is hugely complex and entertaining right from the opening shot to the very final moment. The thrills are first rate, the acting is first rate, the directing is outstanding and the musical score is one of the most haunting in film.Vertigo starts with a rooftop chase in San Fransisco. 'Scottie', a police detective, chases a suspect along with a uniformed police officer. Scottie slips, and nearly falls to his death. The other officer tries to help, and he does fall. From this moment, Scottie has Vertigo - a fear of heights.Cut to a few years later, and he is retired. However, a friend of his has a problem - his wife is behaving oddly and he needs Scottie to follow her. Scottie starts to follow her and watch her, and soon starts to fall in love with her, perhaps even become obsessed with her. After saving her life, it appears that she is falling for him too. But, it all comes to an end when she loses her mind and throws herself from a tower - a tower too high for Scottie to climb because of his Vertigo. Scottie has a breakdown, and is left feeling nothing but guilt. However, one day he sees something that chances his view on what happened.What makes this film stand out from nearly all others is the sheer complexity of the plot. The writing is absolutely first rate with good dialogue, but more importantly believable emotions, real situations and twist after twist to add to the vast story that is being told. Hitchcock genuinely takes each character and puts them through some sort of personal hell, and we really feel a lot of sympathy for each one. He carefully unveils traits through some tense actions scenes, and it always feels like there is more to know about each character. Vertigo isn't just about one man's fear, it's about the obsession that grows from that fear and how it affects those around him and those involved.Added to the exceptional directing is of course the cast. James Stewart puts on arguably his best performance as Scottie, the man so obsessed with a woman he can't see that he's turned into a hypocrite and a destroyer of women. To match him is Kim Novak, who puts her her best performance as Judy, the veiled woman to which there is so much more than it seems.This film, like many of Hitchcock's, is a slow burning thriller. But, unlike his others, this goes into much more depth in terms of emotion and character. He explores the deepest desires and the deepest nightmares of the human mind, and alongside some of the best direction in film and a very fine plot, Vertigo represents a work of film genius. The cherry on top is the haunting score by Benard Herrman, which is genuinely creepy.Absolutely one of the best, complex and diverse thrillers of all time.",10,2,5,30 August 2011
Alien," Jaws in Space
","Jaws in Space - that was how the writers initially pitched this to the producers in Hollywood. And, whilst that is an apt description in some respects, it doesn't do this film enough justice. Alien took sci-fi and horror and gave them both a much needed shake. Before this, sci-fi and alien films had been a bit soft, a bit too hopeful. And most horrors had become a bit clinical in their execution, a bit predictable. Alien is neither of those things. It is a claustrophobic, brutal experience that will leave you sceptical as to whether anything nice waits for us in space, and if it's not nice what will we have to do to stop it. This is almost a horrific version of 2001: A Space Odyssey. Alien starts, unsurprisingly, in the outer depths of space. A spaceship is travelling to earth with cargo, and the crew are in deep freeze. However, after the ship intercepts a signal, the crew are awoken and are ordered to investigate. Needless to say something pretty horrific is waiting for them. This film is genuinely a masterpiece. Some people consider the James Cameron sequel to be superior, but I firmly believe that this is the better. Firstly, this benefits from a mature cast with no Tom Cruise style actor. The cast is made of grounded, realistic actors. Tom Skerritt, a character actor, is Captain Dallas, who is in charge. He acts this with realism, with dignity. He's not a flashy actor, he's just an actor who plays it straight down the line. He is then backed up by other, fabulous character actors such as Yaphet Koto, Ian Holm, Harry Dean Stanton, Veronica Cartwright and of course, John Hurt (in surely the best role). We are also introduced to my personal favourite actress Sigourney Weaver, who even now is the only woman who can open and headline an action film. She acts the role of Ripley to perfection - a normal woman who's doesn't need a man to protect her and can hold her own, but is open to human emotions and is literally terrified. Weaver makes Ripley one of the best heroes because she's a scared woman with no choice but to fight. Also, it's a credit to the writers that the made action revolve around a realistic woman for a change. There's no relying on men, no 'girlie' crying or whatever. No hysterics. Ripley is a real, grounded woman who has to fight and is a match for any man on the ship. Secondly, this Ridley Scott's direction is absolutely superb. Scott is a talented director, but sometimes he allows his directing to get in the way of a good story (Gladiator!!!). Not so with Alien. He makes this story a claustrophobic horror, that builds slowly at a constant, measured pace, then explodes to life (quite literally). From then on, it's a tight, horrific ride until the final climax which is pretty epic in its way. Finally, this benefits from Jerry Goldsmith's best score. A score that is never over the top, doesn't give away the horror or the emotion, and is as measured as the acting and the directing. One of the finest horrors, and one of the finest pieces of storytelling every made. The only tragedy is that its name has been soiled by the later sequels.",10,1,3,24 August 2011
North by Northwest," The Thirty Nine Steps by any other name
","North by Northwest set the standard for nearly all action/adventure films that followed its release in 1959. Raiders of the Lost Ark, Die Hard, Lethal Weapon and many other huge action films owe their existence to this exceptional piece of work. Even the well known 'British villain' can be accredited to this film. Alan Rickman, Jeremy Irons, Tim Roth, Gary Oldman etc all owe their careers to the wonderful James Mason in his role in this.North by Northwest is the big budget 'innocent man suspected of a crime he didn't commit' plot that Hitchcock was so fond of. And, in fairness, it's the best of those particular films.Cary Grant plays Roger Thornhill, a marketing executive with two ex wives, a mother and a bartender relying on him. Then, one day, he's kidnapped by two men working for the mysterious Phillip Vandamm (James Mason). Vandamme accuses Thornhill of being a spy, and threatens him with death unless Thorhill comes clean. Of course, Thornhill says he has no idea what Vandamm is talking about and he's almost killed. He escapes and starts to investigate his own kidnapping, only to then be accused of the murder of an important UN worker. He goes on the run as he attempts to clear his name, and as he does he meets a woman (Eva-Marie Saint), becomes embroiled in a CIA plot and is almost killed in two of the best action scenes of all time (the unforgettable crop dusting scene and the final climax on Mount Rushmore).This film sparkles because everything in it works perfectly. The script by Ernest Lehman is very sharp with some brilliant dialogue. The cast is perfect. The directing is, as with most Hitchcock films, breathtaking. The musical score by Bernard Herrman is, as always, perfect for the film and is now a classic.In terms of directing, this is Hitchcock at his best. In particular, the actions scenes are so well directed that there are very few films that haven't borrowed from this. Certainly the crop dusting scene is one of the best action scenes in history, and is iconic as the shower scene in Psycho. And the final scene at Mount Rushmore is a hugely worthy climax. The pace is nothing but breathtaking, and Hitchcock uses the camera cleverly to show us different emotions.The acting equal the directing in this. Cary Grant is wonderful as Roger Thornhill, the man on the run. Eva-Marie Saint is elegant in her role as the woman being used. And Leo G.Carrol is gives a solid performance as the CIA boss who uses many people to get his way.But, as with any film, there is a stand out performance. In this film, that performance is given by James Mason as Phillip Vandamm, the villain. Mason absolutely purrs through this movie, never raises his voice, is always in control of everything he does and his people do. He set the standard for all villains in film, and in particular gave birth to the 'British villain' that we have all become so used to.There are two points that hold this film back from being perfect. The first is that I think sometimes the motives of other characters are not explored deeply enough. Certainly Eva-Marie Saint's character is never entirely explained. And in some ways, Vandamm's motives are unexplained too. You don't notice this right until the end, where after the Rushmore sequence, the film ends a little too abruptly.The second point is that this film isn't original, yet claims to be. This film is in fact a very clever adaption of John Buchnan's The Thirty Nine Steps. Read the book, see a few of the other adaptions, and you'll realize that this film is The Thiry Nine steps in all but name. And because it gives no credit to that original plot, I can't say that it's perfect.But, overall, those two points won't detract too much from what is a fast paced ride across America, with some exceptional action sequences along the way.",10,0,0,30 August 2011
The Game," Let down only by its ending.
","The Game is another one of those very fine examples of style over substance. There are great action set pieces, some slick dialogue, some sparkling acting and some fantastic direction from David Fincher. But, in the end, where does it really lead? Not really anywhere. Fortunately for this film, because there is so much going on, you can afford to forgive the ending. Nicholas Van Orten (Michael Douglas) is a cynical, detached banker. He has an ex wife he takes no notice of. He has a brother who is clearly disturbed and he has to live with the knowledge that his father committed suicide in front of him. He lives only to make business deals and cares only for money. That is, until his brother gives him a birthday present - a ticket for something known as 'The Game'. Reluctantly, Van Orten signs up to this game, little realising that he's opening up a total nightmare. Soon, he is apparently the victim of fraud, his house is broken into, there are attempts to kill him and his brother is apparently committed. Van Orten is left to try and solve everything himself, using only his wits and whatever sense is left in him. Make no mistake that this film is worth watching. For several exceptional reasons. Firstly, the script and in particular the dialogue is pretty sharp with some cracking action and some good dark humour. Secondly, David Fincher directs this with his usual talent for dark atmosphere and slick action. There are some exceptionally good action scenes and some carefully crafted talk scenes that always move the film forward at breathtaking pace. Finally, the acting it absolutely outstanding. Every part in this film is cast as perfectly as possible. Michael Douglas shines in a role that he is always so well suited to. Sean Penn, someone I'm not usually keen on, adds real paranoia and depth to his scenes, and the two leads are then supported by several very talented character actors that give more than the film gives them in return. The problem here is the ending. It's not all that believable, and feels more like a last minute cop-out because they were either nor sure how to end it, or were too afraid to make it even darker. The ending isn't just unbelievable - realistically it's not possible. After suffering all that he does throughout the film, there's little chance that Van Orten could take that one final twist. He'd either be insane, or a broken man. Instead what we get is something a little too happy, and not dark enough for the rest of the film. However, ending aside, this film is very, very good. I'd still recommend it, even if just for everything up until the ending, the first rate acting and the atmospheric and slick directing.",Null,0,0,30 August 2011
2001: A Space Odyssey," Unmatched scientific elegance.
","Did anyone know the actors in this film? No. Neither did I. And that's exactly what Stanley Kubrick wanted - he wanted to create something that was about more than just an actor - it was about life itself.2001: A Space Odyssey is one of the two greatest epics of all time. It is a film of breathtaking technical brilliance that is matched by some of the most ambitious storytelling of all time. In a nutshell, 2001 tells the story if human evolution. We start in the past, where our ape ancestors are starving and are perhaps even on the verge of extinction. They fight with other animals over a waterhole, and the general outlook is bleak. That is, until they find a mysterious black monolith that has appeared from nowhere. Our ancestors crowd around the monolith, and soon after they take a step towards evolution when they use their first weapon. Then, using the finest transitions in film, we flash forward into our own future and see a space dance between a space ship and space station to Johann Strauss' The Blue Danube. We meet a scientist, Dr Haywood Floyd, who is on his way to the moon in secret. Why? Because they have found another monolith on the moon. And, as before, this monolith represents another jump in evolution. Two astronauts, a team of scientists and a computer called HAL embark on a journey towards Jupiter - and then unknown, leading to one of the finest endings in film that will leave you pretty dazzled and initially confused. With this film though, confusion is what Kubrick was aiming for. I've often heard people say that this is a bad film because it has no conclusive ending, or that it just cheats us out of an answer. But Kubrick was no cheat. He was a man who planned everything. I think that he chose the best possible ending - one that leaves everything open to interpretation because no one know what the future holds, least of all Kubrick. Why provide a wrong answer for the sake of a conventional ending, when you can provide an open, ambiguous ending that asks so much? A conventional ending might have satisfied, up until proved wrong. With this ending, 2001 is timeless. To match the scope of the storytelling is Kubrick's almost unrivalled genius as a technical director. He is one of just two truly artistic, technical directors who always presented films that were large in scope, yet always grounded. 2001 is entirely grounded in its presentation of science and fact - no sound in space, realistic space ships and stations, realistic travel times between planets. There are no magical powers, no 'Warp 5'. There is only fact, upon which Kubrick builds his vision. This film asks everything of mankind. Why are we here? What brought us here? Is there a higher force, and if so is it God, or another alien race? Can we achieve immortality? It asks all these questions and more, yet leaves the answers entirely up to us, because in the end, no one knows what the future holds and therefore how can those questions be answered. And, finally, it leaves us with one final, wonderful question - What waits for us in this universe?Perfection achieved on every level.",10,0,3,24 August 2011
Psycho," The original low budget slasher film.
","It's 1960. Alfred Hitchcock had just seen huge success with North by Northwest, and he was considered a master of slow burning, suspense cinema. He could have had any budget he wanted, any cast he wanted - in fact he could have done anything he wanted.So what did he do? He took a cheap TV crew, a virtually unknown cast and a script that a lot of people weren't keen on and he filmed it. He was the only one sure that it would work - so sure that he traded his standard paycheck for 60% of the net profits (earning him the equivalent of $150 million in today's money).The result...? The original slasher film that instantly changed the concept of horrors, thrillers and villains. This might not be as complex as Vertigo, or as relevant as Rear Window, but this is the film that changed cinema and paved the way for the likes of The Exorcist, Scream and most other slashers, horrors and thrillers. Hitchcock created a piece of cinema history with this film, and you would be hard pressed to find any film maker since who hasn't at some point used Psycho for reference.Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is a lost woman. She wants to get away from everything - her job, her home, her boyfriend, her life. Her chance comes one afternoon when a rich tycoon leaves $40,000 in cash as a deposit for a house. Instead of taking the money to the bank, Marion steals it and goes on the run. After two days, she finds herself a little lost, but near a motel - The Bates Motel. She meets Norman Bates, a shy man who is looking after his invalid mother. She and Norman have a conversation, where she decides that she should go back home and face up to what she has done. However, that night, she is violently murdered by someone, and this coincides with an investigation into her disappearance - an investigation that leads to the best of Hitchcocks's climaxes.What makes this film so good? Well, Hitchcock said it best himself 'It wasn't a message that stirred the audiences, nor was it a great performance...they were aroused by pure film.' This film exists only to terrify us, entertain us, move us, thrill us. There is no message, there is no moral lecture. This film is about one director's vision to take an audience on a roller-coaster ride of thrills and chills. And this film does that to perfection. Nearly all of Hitchcock's most memorable action is in this film (the infamous shower scene is just one), and they are handled so incredibly well that even now they can't cease to entertain. The direction is the winner here. The carefully planned shots, the black and white images, the lighting, the shadows - nothing here has been left to chance and everything has been thought out so, so well. Stanley Kubrick is often accredited with the 'Kubrick stare'. Yet it might well be that he took that idea from Hitchcock, who's final shot of Norman Bates is one of the most chilling and unforgettable shots in film.Of course, whilst this film is brilliant almost exclusively because of Hitchcock's expert direction, we can't forget the cast. Janet Leigh was immortalised in her role as the ill-fated Marion Crane and she does a wonderful job as the woman who is essentially lost in her own life. Martin Balsam adds a touch of class with his portrayal of Arbogast, the private detective. And Vera Miles is strong and effective as Marion's worried sister.But, this acting in this film is virtually owned by Anthony Perkins as the truly chilling Norman Bates, who is arguably the best villain in film. Every second that he is on screen, you know there is something wrong, you know that this sweet, innocent, shy man is hiding a terrible secret. You're afraid to know what it is, but Perkins uses the screen to tease, to make you want to know more about him even though you know it's horrific. Perkins was so good in the role that it actually typecast him and hindered the rest of his career.Between Hitchcock's direction and Perkins acting, there is enough horror to last a lifetime. But added to the strong cast, the wonderful plot and the exceptional soundtrack by Bernard Herrman, and what we have here is something that is truly original, truly groundbreaking and remains a huge milestone in cinema.This is pure cinema at its best. No lectures, no messages. Just action.",10,1,1,30 August 2011
There Will Be Blood," Not as great as they say, but still very good.
","There Will be Blood is a film that has an outstanding reputation, one that perhaps it deserves in some respects, but not in others. It's certainly a great film - well acted, well directed, good plot. But at times there are a few problems with it. TWBB tells the story of Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis), a prospector who will stop at nothing and destroy anything in his way in the pursuit of money. Initially, he starts as a mineral prospector who finds Gold. At the same time, he has an accident and breaks his leg in the middle of nowhere. Not a man to be stopped, he hauls himself into a town to collect the money and put his name to the mine. We know immediately that nothing will stop him. Just a few years later, we see that he has moved on from gold to oil, in a fine cut that shows how quickly times changed between the late 1800's and the early 1900's. In another accident, Daniel acquires a step son that he raises to be his own. Again, years later, and Daniel is now very successful. He finds a huge oil field on a ranch and leases it. But, it's almost too big for him and slowly greed and madness start to take over. We watch as this businessman turns into a relentless, unforgiving monster who turns on everyone in the end. This film is another example of the American Dream gone wrong. But, instead of providing us with a hero, it just presents Plainview as he is - a monster who no one is supposed to like. I think that was a good way to go with the plot. You often hear people saying that they need to like a person or empathise with them for a film to be watchable. I prefer to just have a character that you can focus on, good or bad. Plainview is bad, and the film's dark plot works far more because he never gets redemption, and is never good. And there is no doubt in my mind that Daniel Day-Lewis acts Plainview to perfection. He starts as a soft spoken man and winds up a ruthless monster, and no one could have done better than Lewis. The film also works because of its first rate location, and some very good directing. The opening shots of the film do set the standard, and throughout there are good shots and vast, open locations. There are a few downsides to this film that prevent it from achieving total greatness. Firstly, the plot is almost too much about Plainview. We see his character through and through, but at the expense of every other character in the film. We never really know much about the son. We don't know anything about those who work with Plainview. And we never really know the true motives of the man who pretends to be Plainview's brother. Also, no questions are asked about the brother's death, even though his disappearance would be entirely noticeable. Secondly, the Church and people in it are a bit too clichéd. I think Anderson was trying to make Eli (the religious leader) into a match for Plainview. But instead, it's just too clichéd, too fake. It would have worked more if the Church had been entirely normal. Fortunately though, any problems with this film are hidden by Daniel Day Lewis, who is totally compelling and believable as the ruthless oil man. The overall message of the film isn't lost at all, and what we have here is a relentless story of greed and madness. A film that borders on greatness.",8,0,1,24 August 2011
Rear Window," The original Big Brother.
","Rear Window was the first Hitchcock film I saw. It packed a tense punch then, and still packs a tense punch now. Whilst I don't think it has the emotional depth that say, Vertigo does, it still remains the greatest example of Hitchcock's ability to take a simple plot and turn it into something much, much deeper.Rear Window is set in a small New York apartment, where L.B. Jeffries (James Stewart) has broken his leg and is wheelchair bound. He is also a totally dedicated photographer, a man willing to further than his competitors for any photo (as is seen in the film on numerous occasions). Having been stuck in his wheelchair for some time, he has taken to watching his neighbours during their daily lives. He is warned by his nurse, Stella (Themla Ritter) that there will be trouble if he continues to watch, and that he should instead focus on his girlfriend, Lisa 'Grace Kelly). Sure enough, he doesn't listen and he's soon drawn into what may or may not be a murder, leading to a hugely tense climax towards the end.Rear Window strikes me as two things. Firstly, it's a very early example of Big Brother, or another reality TV show that's like it. The neighbourhood is the show, L.B. Jeffries and we are the audience. Together, we sit and watch the neighbourhood, the neighbours. We see the newly married couple and wonder what is happening behind the closed curtains. We see the musician attempting to create a piece of music that will ignite his career. We see the sculptor. We see the beautiful dancer and want more. We see the lonely woman who desperately wants someone in her life - and we enjoy every second of watching these people as Hitchcock carefully sets us up, just as L.B. Jeffries has been set up, to be witnesses to what may or may not be a crime depending how we choose to view the evidence. And then, when we sure a crime has been committed, we can do as much as any man with a broken leg can do - nothing.Seondly, Read Window is an example of how the power of suggestion can be used to manipulate an audience. Hitchcock is very careful never to show anything - this film is based on suggestion. We know there is a married couple, but we're not sure how their relationship is progressing. We know there is a musician, but we know little of his career. We know there is a lonely women, but we don't know why. We think there has been a murder, but there is no real proof. Hitchcock never shows us anything. He merely uses the power of suggestion.This truly is a magnificent thriller, and is one of Hitchcock's finest examples. Hitchcock slowly builds the tension right from the start and teases us with glimpses of something horrific. We think something has happened, but we have no proof. We want to know more, but can't because we are as useless as L.B. Jeffries. When the action scenes come, they are some of the most tense in the history of film, yet they are so simply. To compliment Hitchcock's directing, there is also the hugely talented cast. James Stewart is in every scene of this film, and it's a credit to him that he's able to so effectively pull off this level of acting. In turn, he is supported by the enchanting Grace Kelly and the entertaining Thelma Ritter.One of the finest examples of thriller, that uses only the power of suggestion and the idea of Big Brother to create so much tension. This shows why Hitchcock was truly the master of suspense - he uses only suggestion to create and idea. We're the ones who then take that idea and expand upon it. If only modern slasher thrillers built up suspense like this does. For those who enjoy this film, I'd also recommend Hitchcock's 'Rope', which could be viewed as a twin of this - except it's set in the murderer's apartment instead.",10,1,3,30 August 2011
Gangs of New York," A good film, but not a great film.
","Gangs of New York is a very fine example of style over substance, with a bit of acting that just hauls it into the 'good' ratings. The initial plot is one of interest. A war between supposed 'natives' and 'Irish immigrants' in the middle of Five Points in 1800's New York was a very good idea that handled correctly could have made a real statement. And this film certainly had the cast to do it with - Daniel Day Lewis as the leader of the natives, and Liam Neeson as the leader of the Irish immigrant. The problem is that rather than focus on the war, it chooses to then focus on a somewhat clichéd revenge story. Bill the Butcher (Day-Lewis) kills the Priest (Neeson), and the Priest's son then comes back to kill Bill. And here's the first problem that shows the story is wrong - A Priest can't have children if they've been ordained before marriage etc. That's actually quite a slip from the film-makers and immediately the film loses a sense of realism. It then goes on to try and tell too many other stories. To add to the Five Points war, you then have the Civil War, a love story that doesn't seem to make sense and corrupt politics. Scorsese tries to make the film an epic, but doesn't explore it enough and leaves a few too many lose ends. However, there are many plus points in this film that make it entirely watchable and entertaining. First of all, Scorsese's direction is very, very good. He directs some slick action scenes, some brutal fight scenes and the overall look of the film is outstanding. The set is exceptional, and clearly was researched properly even if other elements of the film weren't. Also, generally the characters are defined enough that you know their motives, and were the cast exceptionally well so there is at least realism in the acting. Liam Neeson as the Priest at the beginning is a solid role. Brendan Gleeson as 'Monk' is good, and even Leo DiCaprio is competent enough. But this film really is about the acting between Daniel Day Lewis as Bill Butcher and Jim Broadbent as 'Boss' Tweed, the corrupt politician. They are both outstanding. Overall, this is a well acted, stylishly directed film. It's good to look at and there's enough plot development that it is entertaining. But I do feel that if they'd not bothered with the revenge plot and had instead focused on the political story, they'd have had a far better film.",7,0,0,24 August 2011
