National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Reminds Me Of A Classic Spy Thriller
","When someone critiques the script for a movie sequel, one of the things they might write in the column is S-O-S, which stands for 'Same Old Stuff.' The plot for this sequel, however, is really quite original. It takes the characters on an entirely new adventure without having to recycle the plot points from the first film in the series.The scene atop Mount Rushmore reminds me of Cary Grant's Spy Classic, 'North By Northwest,' and then morphs into an Indiana Jones-style adventure. We also get to see the sights, outside AND in, from Paris, to London, to Washington, D.C.The actors are also A-list, as opposed to other films that might only have one or two A-listers. It costs more to make a movie like that, and in this case we can see that the film is the better for it. Thus, my complements to Nicholas Cage, John Voight, and the rest of the cast.",10,1,4,28 December 2007
Minority Report," Better than 'Indiana Jones!'
","'Minority Report' is a classic hit that you'll watch over and over again.Some critics were saying it is Spielberg's best movie SINCE 'Indiana Jones,' while I contend that the movie is better THAN 'Indiana Jones!'What about 'Schindler's List?'  Well, since that's a dramatic masterpiece it belongs with films like 'The Godfather' that you might watch once every five to ten years.I predict 'Minority Report' will set a new record for DVD sales, and be one of those movies you can easily watch two or three times a year and have a Rock & Roll Ride each time.I guarantee 'Minority Report' will literally make your eyes pop out!Tom Cruise is quite good in the comedic moments, and that makes his cameo in 'Austin Powers in Goldmember' something to look forward to!The Coming Attractions trailers that accompany the film are quite sensational.Usually, I may see a movie when it comes out in the theaters, and then rent the DVD when it comes out 6 months later.  However, I think I'll come back to the theater to see 'Minority Report,' and bring along a few friends.",Null,0,0,21 June 2002
Wedding Crashers," Looks Like A Comedy Classic
","This is one of those movies like 'Animal House,' 'The Blues Brothers,' or '10' that will be watched over again and over again ten, twenty, and thirty years from now. There are many scenes in the movie that really seem believable and completely true to life. The two Wedding Crashers remind me of real people that I knew in college. Will Ferrel's role seems a bit too grotesque for my tastes, but hey, there actually are characters like him in any college fraternity. I'm a comedy writer, myself, and I'm willing to bet that a great many of the scenes were based on real things that had happened to people the writer knew. Wedding Crashers is not just a parody; it's a social commentary on how too much partying and unbridled promiscuity will finally catch up with you. Well, at least the two Wedding Crashers repent and return to the side of right and virtue in the end... It's a good movie, and in many ways, quite true to life.",10,2,5,1 August 2005
