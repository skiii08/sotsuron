Ali," An oscar-worthy, knock-out performance for Will Smith!
","First off, I should say that as an amateur historian I'm always pleased to see a historical drama, and this film definitely has its history straight! Mohammed Ali is one of modern history's Great American Heroes, one who not only fought for his boxing title against some of the greatest contenders in history (Frasier and Foreman could have been undisputed champions at any other time in boxing history), but who had the courage to fight the United States Government for his rights!  Ali's life intersects with many important figures and events of the 20th century, and through this depiction of his life we get a slice of the African-American Experience of the 50s, 60s and 70s.But what makes this film special is Will Smith's performance, he carries this film capturing Ali's charisma, grace and sense of humor, and Smith obviously bulked up for the part (he's technically not big enough to play a heavyweight boxer, neither was Stallone in the Rocky film series, but like Stallone he overcomes that with the help of a little trick photography). Like Rocky, the boxing scenes are accurate and brutal (in fact, the Rocky films used the fights of Ali as source material for their choreography). Other notable performances were Mario Van Peebles as Malcom X (he wears that part with instant authority), Ron Silver as Angelo Dundee (low key but powerful), Jamie Foxx as Drew Brown (showing that comedians can go back to drama any time they want), and Jon Voight disappearing into the part of Howard Cosell.The pacing and cinematography of the film are also excellent, keeping it moving and interesting even at the low points in Ali's life when there wasn't much action, only despair.  Likewise the sound track is moving and distinctly African-American sounding.Over all, a knockout punch!  Now shake hands and go to your theaters!",10,0,0,25 December 2001
Annie Hall," *TOTALLY* OVERRATED!!
","Everybody cites this film as a Woody Allen favorite, I really can't agree, though I'd concede it was a critical milestone in his ongoing evolution as a great American writer/director.  It has a few good laughs, a few insights into Woody's psyche (though these are not necessarily general insights), but in the end it doesn't really leave you with much to take away.  I liked 'Hannah and Her Sisters' much better, it has all the laughs and insights 'Annie Hall' had but is  much, much deeper, and it leaves you with a life-affirming and *positive* ending unlike most of his movies before!",7,0,1,31 March 2002
