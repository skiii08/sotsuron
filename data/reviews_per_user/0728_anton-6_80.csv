Vertigo," By far the best Hitchcock film and one of the biggest film experience I`ve ever hade!!!
",First I must say that the cinematography and the colors in this film are simply masterful.It´s by far Hitchcocks best film and also One of Hitchcock's most discussed films.The acting is fantastic by James Stewart and the rest of the cast.Vertigo also feels like Hitchcocks most grown-up film because it´s not a bit funny and it´s almost impossible to figure out how it going to end so I was really surprised at the end.Vertigo is really a masterpiece and it´s one of the best film experience I have ever had.5/5,10,2,4,7 October 2001
Scarface," Almost trash,the only thing that saves the film is Al Pacino!!!!!
","Just a very bad film.The only thing that is good is Al Pacino´s acting the other:TRASH!!!!!!!!Bad music,bad screenplay..............................RATING:1 or maybe 2- out of 5 BUT only for Al Pacino´s acting",2,10,19,3 October 2001
Ali," Failed in many ways...
","It is hard to make a film like this good. I have really looking forward to watching this film since I have been very interesting in boxing history and I am also finding Muhammad Ali as a great person. He truly changed the world. This film is not bad but not good either. First when I heard that Will Smith should be in it I was a bit suprised, a comedian that stars in films like Bad Boys and Men in Black. Actually he was the main problem with this film. He was not powerful at all. I did not get touched of his acting and he made the film lost the feeling to watch it. It is very hard to make films like this and I think that if you don't know anything about this story you would like it. Ali's story is fashinating and I  recommend you to watch 'When We were kings' a documentary about the match against George Foreman in Zaire. 5/10",5,2,3,11 February 2004
Raiders of the Lost Ark," 4,5 out of 5
","It has inspired many new movies like: Tomb raider mummy....... but none are as good as this one.Good  but I still think that there are better action films than this.I think that this film is funny and there are much action in itrating: 4,5 out of 5",8,0,2,30 July 2001
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," A bit over dramatic but when I was a kid I loved it!!!
","I first saw it when I was about six or seven years and thought it was great.But when I got older I just did not found it so very good. It´s over dramatic and not Spielberg´s best film but I like it because when I was a kid it was one of my favorite films.
RATING:3+ or 4- out of 5",7,0,0,1 October 2001
Casablanca," One of the best Hollywood films ever made!!!!!!!!
","It dosen´t how many times I have seen this film,the end is still as good as if it was the first time. 
'Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship'
It´s a very good mix between romance and thriller.The acting is superb by Humphrey Bogart,Ingrid Bergman and Claude Rains as captain Renault.Also the music has a big part,because as you all know nobody sings 'as times goes by' as good as Sam(Dooley Wilson).A really classic and one of the best hollywood films ever.5/5",10,1,2,8 October 2001
Training Day," Pretty good! Worth watching because of Denzel Washington's performance.
",I like that it not(as in almost every other Hollywood film)shows the cop as the hero. It's about a cop(Hawke)that on his first day he works with a REAL rough detective(Washington). The film is entertaining and funny too watch with a good sound track but the end was really bad! The fight is so unrealistic it looks like a parody. Otherwise it is worth checking out but nothing special. 6/10,Null,0,11,6 October 2002
Chinatown," Truly, one of the most entertaining films ever!
","Made as an old Film-noir. Everybody said that this film was great but the story was all to complicated but I thought it was very EASY to understand. It's about a detective that is so masterful played by Jack Nicholson that comes in to a world of crime and murders. The famous scene were Roman Polanski does a very terrifying thing with a knife is superb. It's also very funny to see John Huston in such a great role(one of the best directors ever)You follows the detective and this gangster/film-noir is truly one of the most entertaining films ever. Technical it's perfect, the lightening, cinematography and the settings. The end is one of the darkest ever and I do not use to like dark endings but this time I had another feeling. It was frightening but also masterful and the film is still today very powerful.
The 1970's was a great film period in America and this is one of the better films I have seen during that period. One of the most entertaining films ever!.10/10",10,1,3,1 April 2002
Monty Python's Life of Brian," The very best of PYTHON!!!
","I don´t know how many times I have seen this film.But it seems that I laugh more and more every time I see it.I am religious my self and I don´t get angry because they have done this film.Personal I think that this film is more then funny it´s almost a masterpiece.I do not see nothing wrong in joking about god in a normal level(he he).The screenplay is great.The ending is still one of the best comedy endings ever.There´s only really one problem with this film as in all of python´s movies.They are not so technical perfect,If they would have concentrate just a bit more on making it more technical great it could have been a real masterpiece.But sometimes their films look more like a (I do not really know how to put it)television show or something.But overall Life of brian is their very best film and I think it´s great.I have always founding it hard to give this movie a point between 1-5 but when I saw it again last night I decided to give it something between 5 and 4.RATING: 4,5/5",9,1,4,6 January 2002
Se7en," Very well done,well acted and VERY exciting!!!!!!!!!!
","This film was VERY VERY exciting.And it was also technical brilliant and the acting by Morgan Freeman(which is a great actor)has never been better but also Brad Pitt is good.Even if the film are good it´s extremely Dark and I am not sure if I like the end because it´s one of the most dark endings I have ever seen.Still the film is very well done,well acted and VERY exciting.4/5",8,1,1,20 October 2001
Mississippi Burning," A interesting and entertaining film!!!!!
",The Cinematography by Peter Biziou is excellent and the acting by Gene hackman and Willem Dafoe is great.Not perfect but very entertaining and the film has a good story that is inspired by real-life events.4/5,7,1,2,12 November 2001
Finding Nemo," A really nice movie...
","This film I think is alongside 'Shrek' the best film in this genre. It includes everything a film like this should include plus a bit more. It is a film that includes stuff for the whole family. The only big problem with this film is one of the main characters Dory, she is not funny! Otherwise I strongly recommend it! 8/10",8,0,1,23 January 2004
The Great Dictator," Chaplin´s satire is a Masterpiece!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
","This film was made 1940 and then you could not show the madness of Hitler as it really was and Chaplin himself says that if he knew that the Nazi´s were that evil he could never have done this film.But Chaplin can show Hitler´s madness when he plays the VERY crazy and evil dictator Hynkel in the country Tomania.
It´s a very strange film that is both a hilarious slapstick comedy and a satire.He plays two roles in this: a Jewish Barber that is almost as the tramp and The crazy dictator Hynkel.It also includes some of Chaplin´s best moments:The barber scene(it´s almost as good as the famous scene in 'the gold rush'.The Dance of the rolls)and the speech is easily one of Chaplin´s best moments.5/5",10,2,4,4 November 2001
The Others," Inspiring
","The end reminds me of 'The sixth sense',the film reminds me of 'The shining'.But I actually liked this one better(of course it was a while since I last saw 'The shining'). First of all this film is very scary,one of the crepiest films I have seen. The lightning,editing,direction,cinematography and all are perfectly made and it set a mood that is made to scare you. Then the gorgeous Nicole Kidman acts superb and I was also very impressed with acting by the children. This is a ghost-story and it´s both smart and scary.There´s only one thing in the end they could have concentrate on showing a bit more of.4+/5",9,0,0,3 March 2002
L.A. Confidential," The best of American film!
","I had actually read the book before I saw it but still I was very excited when I watched it. It is a very good story, not so hard to follow. It creates the perfect mood, it feels very much like in the 1950's.
The acting is might the strongest in the film. Kim Basinger won a Academy Award but I thought that MANY other stars(Russel Crowe, Kevin Spacey...) deserved to get one too. I could only find one weakness: There is might a little to much action, which is not bad(very well-done action scenes) but it overshadow the drama in the film a bit. 8/10",8,1,3,3 October 2002
X-Men," What a stupid and silly film!1/5.
","I tried to like this silly action film.Bryan Singer has done 'the usual suspects' and it´s placed #15 in the top 250 over the best films ever.WHY??? I did not like that one at all.X-men tries to be this smart and on the same time funny action film.I just don´t get it: Bad acting,silly story...*/*****",1,7,16,6 January 2002
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," A comic masterpiece!!!!!!!!!
","This films feels VERY frightening these days(because of other reasons).It really has a excellent cast,Peter Sellers plays three roles(the president, Captain Lionel Mandrake and Dr. Strangelove).It´s also funny that George C. Scott is doing one of his best roles.It´s a fantastic screenplay and Sellers' phone conversation with Soviet premier is one of the funniest parts in film history.It´s the ultimate black-comedy.A perfect film that feels very important and it´s my second favorite Kubrick film after after 2001: A Space Odyssey.5/5       
'You can't fight in here, this is the War Room!'",10,1,2,27 October 2001
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Not as good as Empire strikes back but better then star wars
",It´s a very good way of ending the trilogy. To bad that the phantom menace is very bad.but this is superb.9/10,8,0,1,16 June 2001
MASH," A great satire!!!
","Overall this is a great movie even if not all of the jokes are  funny anymore.
It´s a satire with excellent cast:Donald Sutherland Elliott Gould and Tom Skerritt.It´s hilarious(even if not all of the jokes are funny)and I think that if you like to laugh you should see this!!! Rating:4,5 out of 5",9,0,2,18 September 2001
Battleship Potemkin," Thanks dad for recommending this masterpiece for me!!!!
","A couple of days ago I talked to my father and asked him if he  could recommend a classic film.Then he said:'Pansarkryssaren Potemkin'(That´s what it called in Sweden)and then he start talking about the famous Odessa Steps sequence.It could be a little tough to see a silent drama film but this was something else.Perfect in every ways.It´s one of the best films I have seen,a all-time classic.I am looking forward to see Eisenstein´s other works.I have read much in books about the  Odessa Steps sequence but it was better then I had thought(maybe the best scene in film history????).5/5",10,1,3,31 October 2001
Taxi Driver," Martin Scorsese's best film!
","A modern piece of art. Scorsese( he actually plays a little part in this film) is a very good director and after having seen these I think it's his best film, his direction is perfect. It's about a Vietnam veteran who can not sleep so he decides to work long shifts. When he drives around he sees all kinds of creepy things he is soon near a breakdown.Robert De Niro's performance as Travis Bickle is both one of the best and one of the most frightening performances I have ever seen. The scenes were he talking to himself in the mirror is entertaining still very frightening. In the end you understand everything clearly( I had many visions of what happened after the film had end). The film is very scary and the music by Bernard Herrmann is superb(He died right after the music for the film was completed). 'Taxi Driver' is a masterpiece that you could see more then once. I agree much on it's current position on the top 250: number 29.10/10",10,0,0,11 May 2002
Full Metal Jacket," A SUPERB WAR FILM!!
",First I must say that the cinematography is masterful and the acting is brilliant. The first half is fantastic(when Marine basic training on Parris Island.)and the second is not as good but it´s still good.Kubrick was a genius and this is a superb war film.I rate it 4+/5-almost five.,9,0,0,1 December 2001
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Star wars is back!
","After episod one the phantom menace wich I thought was lousy, it's good to see this. My personal favorite star wars is 'The empire strikes back'(10/10) and this is not as the old trilogy but it's not far from 'Star wars' and 'Return of the jedi'.
It's telling to stories that in the end becomes one. Anakin is beggining to become a little weird in this film. The acting is also pretty good by him and the rest of the cast is also good. I do not think that any of the Star wars films are some of the best ever made-except maybe 'The empire strikes back'- but this one has fantastic special effects and makes me look forward to episode three.I give it a 7 or a 8 out of 10",8,0,2,25 May 2002
The Godfather: Part II," A masterpiece.Almost as good as 'the godfather'!!!!!
","I don´t know why I like the first film a bit more then this.Still this is almost as good and it´s a really powerful film.The acting is masterful by Al Pacino and I was VERY impressed by Robert De Niro´s acting who deserved his Oscar for best Supporting Actor.It´s the same music as in the first film,and that music is fantastic.This film is over three hours but it´s not a bit boring and even if I have heard that the godfather part three can´t compare with the first two films I can´t wait to see it.This film is a beautiful epic.5/5",10,2,3,13 October 2001
Léon: The Professional," Watch it!
",When I saw this film last week I was a bit worried. I thought it would be a very nice technical film but the story would be(as in many other films)thin. It's about a hitman which worlds gets upside down when a little girl called Mathilda comes into his life.Some scenes are so perfect that no one can complain. I didn't like 'the fifth element' or 'nikita' but this film include so much powerful stuffs that it is a must. 8/10,8,0,2,22 December 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Far away from the best film ever still superb!!!
","I was tired of all these commercials before I went and saw it.Every were it´s Lord of the rings posters and I can go on and talking about all of these hysterical commercials.I love the books(I read them a couple of years ago)and the thing that makes this film special is that Peter Jackson have really found the right mood for this film.I have never doubted about that Jackson should have made this film bad.The acting is superb,great editing and good cinematography.It´s very hard to make a film of the books but they have really made this film to a beautiful adventure.I can´t wait to see 'Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers'.I still can´t understand why this film is voted as number one in the top 250 films. I found it very hard to rate this film because I think that when you see the whole trilogy on DVD I am sure that it will be a masterpiece.In maybe 30 years this trilogy will be counted as a classic.But I will  rate the first one 9/10.",9,0,0,5 January 2002
He Got Game," One of the most pathetic films ever!!!
",Spike Lee is a good director and he has made some great films but I could hardly watch this film.The acting was awful even by Denzel Wahington and the sex scenes are silly.It tries to be raging bull but honestly it is trash.The only thing that is good is the basketball scenes.Then the end I guess is the worst of all times.Why did Spike Lee made this film?????? Well I forgive him and forget about this film and instead watch his other great films.1/5,1,1,5,26 December 2001
North by Northwest," One of the most entertaining films ever made!!!
","Not a dead second in this film.Cary Grant chased cross country by both spies (who think he's a double agent) and the police (who think he's an assassin). Cary Grant must have inspired many actors as Roger O. Thornhill who delivers one funny line after another. The film includes one of the best scenes in film history.Not my favorite Hitchcock film(I think that Vertigo is better)but on of the most entertaining films ever made and it could be one of the best American films ever made.
RATING:5/5",10,0,0,1 October 2001
The Shining," 'Here´s Johnny'
",Not so scary as I thought it should be but it´s scary enough.The end of the movie is great but the movie is to long.The acting is superb  by Jack Nicholson and the rest of the cast.Rating: well it´s to long so I give it a 7/10,8,0,0,17 June 2001
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," this movie include: action action action action action action action action action action and action
","Great sequel and great action and great one-liners.I don´t like Arnold so much but in this he is pretty funny.Edward Furlong is not a very good actor but you don´t think off that when there are so much action in this movie.Great direction by James Cameron,along with face off this is the best action film of the 90´s.
 I give it a 9/10",9,1,1,16 June 2001
Duck Soup," One of the classic comedies!
","I had heard a lot about this classic Marx Brother film. That it should be their best and I think I have seen almost every Marx film now. It's true what I've heard. it is really one of the funniest! The story about the country freedonia is made for showing a lot of funny scenes with the four brothers(Harpo,Chico,Groucho and Zeppo). Groucho says a lot of hilarous one-liners like: 'We're fighting for this woman's honor, which is more than she ever did'. This film is a must-see for all fans of classic comedy. 10/10",10,0,0,17 October 2002
Apocalypse Now," Like a trip to HELL!
","(This review is only on the 'redux' version)
This film is about the madness in the Vietnam war but also on every war. I saw the redux version and I have not seen the first version. I did not know that this film should be as dark as it is. It shows the darkest sides of humans: war. The story is about during the Vietnam war, captain Willard(excellent played by Martin Sheen) gets a mission. And that mission is to find colonel Kurtz(Marlon Brando)which has gone mad. And kill him.The people that you follows on the boat is people that really is out there dying for nothing.The acting is brilliant by the famous cast. This film is one of the most dark and one of the biggest film experiences you can have.5/5",10,0,0,26 March 2002
Being John Malkovich," A BIG Disappointment ... 3/10
",I had wanted to see this film but when I saw it I near couldn´t keep my eyes open.In the start I thought it was great and superb.but after a 40 minutes you get bored and think that it´s just a bad film.VERY OVERRATED: 3/10,2,1,3,20 June 2001
Aliens," Nothing special.....
",I haven´t seen any of the other Alien films so I don´t know if they are good.The acting by most of the cast is bad and it´s pretty silly.But the special effects it´s amazing and overall it´s pretty exciting but Terminator 2 is much better.RATING:3+ out of  5,6,4,8,29 September 2001
The Exorcist," Maybe it was scary in 1973 but not scary anymore!!!!
","ItÂ´s a very silly film and itÂ´s NOT scary anymore.When Max von Sydow comes the film gets worse and you just want it to end. I must say that the special effects is still very good but the rest is just bad and the film is maybe entertaining and watchable but NOT scary anymore.
RATING: 2,5 out of 5",5,1,7,10 September 2001
Ocean's Eleven," Very stylish,fast and funny.
","You understand in the start that this gangster comedy is no trash like 'Gone in sixty Seconds'.Not just only because of the famous actors mostly because of smart Soderbergh´s style that makes this feel fresh entertaining and funny.I would say that the main characters in this film are George Clooney and Brad Pitt and the acting is mostly good to.But it´s not great because it has some problems.Julia Roberts has a so boring characters,I mean she´s good-looking but what more.It is not her fault she is a good actor but in this film the character for her was really boring and that was a disappointment.It´s a entertaining and funny film.The end is great and the best about it is the technical stuff.I would call this a film that is good  but nothing you see twice.3+/5",7,0,1,24 January 2002
The Dirty Dozen," Feels a bit old still exciting and funny!
","This film is funny and has an all star cast: Charles Bronson,Lee Marvin,Donald Sutherland,Telly Savalas.... Some scenes in it are silly but this is a very exciting film(specially at the end) and also it has some funny parts. It's better then the most new action films. Deserves a 7/10",7,1,2,26 May 2002
Lawrence of Arabia," A masterpiece!!!!!!!!!!
","David Lean´s magnificent biography of T. E. Lawrence is a fantastic epic.I think that the film is about 3 hours and 40 minutes and it´s not the kind of film you see 5 times in the same week but it´s still a masterpiece. It won seven Oscars and I think that it deserved every one of them.'Lawrence of Arabia' is masterfully shot in the desert and it´s one of the most beautiful films ever made.The direction,Cinematography and the Editing is perfect and the music is great.
Peter O'Toole does one of the best roles I have ever seen as T.E. Lawrence.I was also very impressed by the rest of cast.Stars like: Alec Guinness,Anthony Quinn,Anthony Quayle,Claude Rains and Omar Sharif.
A epic masterpiece.Perfect and I don´t know which film I like best this or David Lean´s other film 'The Bridge on the River Kwai'.5/5",10,1,4,6 November 2001
School of Rock," Worthless
","This film made me very dissapointed. When it began I thought it would be a pretty funny film but it wasen't. It's about a guy working in a school and is obsessed to teach the kids rock music. The story is bad, the film is far to nice and you can impossible get intrested in this crap. I felt that it had some funny lines but otherwise it is a film that you really should not be fooled and go and watch. Jack Black is a good musician and also a good comedian but I did not laugh at him in this at all.Also one thing I noticed was that it feelt like a comedy show on television not a movie, anyone agree?Very weak 2/10",2,4,14,13 March 2004
No Man's Land," All I can say is: SEE IT NOW!
",I saw this early this morning at the a film festival in Gotemburg.The director was there and all.It´s a very frightening anti-war film that has three main characters two of them are Bosnian´s and one of them is a Serb.They are soldiers but also normal men.And war makes hate.This is a very symbolic film I would call a masterpiece.Those three persons  together shows what war is:HELL.The director Danis Tanovic himself says that it´s of course about just this war but it´s not like if you see this film in ten years you wont understand it.During their time on no man´s land they are civil to each other but the conflict continues and in the end that´s what is most important.The final scene of the film is superb.A film that  will go to film history.Worth to see by everyone.5/5,10,65,119,26 January 2002
Patton," A great War/drama.George C. Scott acts unforgettable!!!!
",I say as Leonard Maltin: 'Milestone in screen biographies'Scott´s performance as the brilliant(but almost crazy)General George Patton is unforgettable .The war scenes are Great and it´s a very good war film.Still I can´t give it a 5/5 because it´s a bit too long.If  it had been a little bit shorter it could have been a bit more Interesting.A great Screenplay by Francis Ford Coppola and Edmund H. North.I rate it a 9/10 which is a 4+/5.,9,2,5,13 October 2001
La Grande Illusion," So,I finally saw it and of course I thought it was one of the best films ever!!!
","I have tried to get this film for months on the criterion collection but it seems impossible here in Sweden(Maybe not impossible,you can order it on Amazon but that´s to expensive).So when I finally found it on video this is what I say about it:This anti-war masterpiece film is really ONE OF THE GREATEST FILMS EVER.I almost liked it as much as seven samurai.It´s a about a group of French prisoners during the world war one.The performances is simply some of the best I have seen(Jean Gabin Erich von Stroheim...).The cinematography is beautiful,great script but I guess i was most impressed by the direction by Jean Renoir.I don´t think that I have been more touched by a film then this.It has such a deep humanity.A poetic film that should be seen by every one.Also remember that I have only seen this film once and it could be in my top 20 over the best films ever and when I watch it again it could be in top 3.RATING: 5/5",10,39,62,4 January 2002
Donnie Brasco," A great and Interesting mob film!!!!
","The thing that makes the film so interesting is that it´s based on a true story.The acting is very good by Johnny Depp and Al Pacino.Not Perfect but very Interesting and good acting.4,5/5",9,0,1,13 October 2001
8 Mile," A very appreciated movie!
",Hip-hop as been my music for a long time. Even if Eminem is not one of those artists I listen too very much this film describes a culture. The film is really worth watching for all ages it is a film that also includes a nice soundtrack. The best part is of course the freestyle. I also did like Eminems acting which I was a bit worried about before I saw it. I strongly recommend it. 8/10,8,1,3,12 January 2004
2001: A Space Odyssey," Kubricks best film ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
","The first time I saw it I did not think so much about it.It was: beautiful and weird.But the second time I find out that this is by light years thebest Science-Fi ever made and it is Kubricks best film ever. A stunning time travel that is very mind blowing.
Then I would like to say that the people who have comment on this film  said that it´s boring have wrong!!! First of all I did not find this a bit boring and I hope you understand that is is no star wars.
You can go on and Analyze and talk about this forever without really getting an answer:it´s ART!!!!!
RATING: 5/5(just a note: I have comment before on the films:Nosferatu(1922) which I  rated 5/5  and Young Frankenstein(1974)which I rated 10/10 but I have changed my mind so I give Nosferatu(1922) 4+ out of 5 and Young Frankenstein(1974)a 9/10)",10,0,1,29 September 2001
Singin' in the Rain," FUNNY!!!!
","If you want to see a musical it can´t get better than this. Funny song numbers good actors but at the end it´s a few boring songs. The story is about Hollywood during the transition to talkies.
RATING: 4 out of 5",8,2,5,29 September 2001
Once Upon a Time in America," In my view of the film it's underrated!
","I am a big fan of Sergio Leone. He was truly one of the big masters of cinema. His way to mix sound and pictures is masterful. I have seen the godfather trilogy many times and have always heard very much about it. 'Once upon a time in America' is no film that anybody has talked so much about. I love the music, I love the way the film is done and I love the acting. This big epic is one of the best gangster films ever.If you must compare it to the godfather trilogy maybe I choose godfather because it lies a bit closer to my heart(I have seen the film all since I was a kid). I think that this film could be too long and to boring for some people but for me it's a study of one mans regret. I really like the mysterious mood in the film. For any fan of film this is a must. 10/10",10,0,4,3 January 2004
Life Is Beautiful," One of the 90`s best!!!!!
","This film is both touching,sad and hilarious funny.The first half of the film you almost laugh all the time but then the second half the film gets very frightening.It´s about a family who comes to a concentration camp in the World War 2.Roberto Benigni plays brilliant(In this role he is almost as Chaplin)as the fantastic man that will do anything for his family.A masterpiece that easily is one of the 90`s best.5/5",10,1,3,1 November 2001
A Clockwork Orange," Very Frightening!!!!
","The start and the singing in the rain scene is the most violent things I have ever seen.The acting by Malcolm McDowell as the misfit Alex DeLarge is really Superb and even if it´s not Kubricks best film it´s a very well done and a strange future-vision. Kubricks other films is much more beautiful than this.You can´t forget this film,even if you want to it´s impossible to forget.I recommend it but it´s not sure that you will like it,I did but I don´t love it.4/5",8,0,0,11 October 2001
From Hell," Very well-done but...
","... First of all I think it is a film that in maybe 20 or 30 years it will not be forgotten. It has a very scary style and I am very impressed that the Hughes Brother made this film. They have before made films like Dead Presidents(Which I haven't seen) and Menace to Society(Which is actually good). The acting was originally why I saw this film, I like Johnny Depp very much and he is very good in this one. I mostly see him in this pretty strange roles and he does them very well. Heather Graham was not bad either but nothing special at all.
It is a very entertaining film even if I thought the story was a bit complicated and everything was not perfect. Before I saw 'From Hell' I belivied that it should be a bit better then it was, still I will see it again and now I recommend it because overall it is a good film.
7/10",7,0,1,14 July 2002
Rocky," Good but nothing to remember!!!!!!
","I don´t like Sylvester Stallone at all but he has done two good roles: This and Cop land.
The typical 'sport'  story about the boxer who gives his all to win the championship.The boxing scenes are nothing special and you understand how it going to end in the start.Still the film has a heart and it´s very hard to hate so I give this a 3/5.I have not seen all of the other rocky films but I have seen some parts of the other  films on cabel-tv and that look just like trash.
RATING:3/5",6,0,12,4 October 2001
Some Like It Hot," One of the funniest!
","Two Musicians happens two become witness of the St. Valentine's Day Massacre in Chicago and to escape they join a all-woman band that is going to Florida.Curtis, Lemmon and Monroe are fantastic in this film together. I think it's their best comedy roles. The script must be one of the funniest ever written. A superb dialogue and not one boring scene in the whole film. This is the first Billy Wilder film I see, Now I will soon watch 'The Apartment'.I understand why this is called one of the greatest comedy's of all times. A comic masterpiece that I think I will see over and over again. 10/10",10,8,12,2 May 2002
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," I don´t like the books but this is pretty good!!!
","THE BOOKS: I don´t like them at all.WHY??? Because of they are all the same.I have read four Potter books and I liked the first one but the rest are just almost exactly as the first one.Another thing is that the kids in the books are stereotypes.I mean when I was a kid I was WILD but in Harry Potter all of the kids are little angels(but of course not the ones that are evil,and I do mean evil).THE FILM: It´s a good adaption from the film even if it is a bit to long(But I don´t think that it could have been shorter).It has magnificent special effects and the acting is also good.John Cleese is in the film for about 10 seconds and says two lines.WHY???????RATING:3+/5",6,0,1,23 December 2001
Three Colors: Blue," Kieslowski's masterful story about freedom is a must-see!
","Kieslowski is a visual master. This is a very symbolic film that shows Juliette Binoche who lose her dotter and husband in a car crash(Her husband is a famous composer). She starts a new life and moves to Paris. There she lives a wordless life without doing so much. It's masterfully shot and the film is not only showing her problem, it is showing the human nature. Juliette Binoche's performance is so very perfect. Her silent all the time in the film is touching and actually frightening.
A very good film that I might though was a little overloaded some times(what I trying to say was that it was might a little much for me to understand some times). Still a superb film and a film that you thinks very much of after you have seen it. It is the first of three films about the French colors, the other are white and red. 9/10",9,2,4,20 May 2002
The Untouchables," I don´t like Brian De Palma and Kevin Costner BUT...
","This film great.Historical this film is only okay(everything is not perfect) but I should not say something because I dont´s know so much about AL Capone.It´s first class-entertainment.I don´t like the director Brian De Palma at all, for example his films Mission Impossible and scarface are worthless.And I also don´t like Kevin Costner but he was pretty good in this.It was not the technical that I liked most in this film, it was the magnificent script written by David Mammet. It has a superb dialogue.And of course Sean Connery is great.What I did not like was that I founded Eliot Ness being crazy but they show him here as a hero. He does a lot of unnecessary things in this film and still he is a hero.And oh another great thing is the train-station scene that is similar to 'Battleship Potemkin'.4/5",8,2,4,24 February 2002
The Godfather: Part III," Good,but can´t compare with the first two films!!!
",First I must say that Al Pacino´s acting is brilliant as Michael Corleone.The film focuses more on the main character of the films and that´s interesting but the film is not at all as powerful as the first two films.And it´s also true that Sofia Coppola´s acting is not good. So I was almost sure that I would give it a 3/5 but when the shocking good ending came I coulden´t give it less then a weak four.I can´t recommend the godfather DVD collection enough.4-/5,7,1,2,20 October 2001
It's a Wonderful Life," I guess 'Timeless' is the right word for this film.
","I have heard that they show this film every Christmas in America and I can´t understand why they don´t show it every year here in Sweden.A film that makes you happy.First off all I would like too say that the acting by James Stewart is superb and Henry Travers as the angel is very funny.The rest of the acting is also great.The cinematography is also excellent.
I would call it a masterpiece.A Sentimental tale about life that I am sure will make you happy.It has not aged a bit.5/5",10,1,4,31 December 2001
Psycho," After 41-years it´s still very scary!!!
",a normal woman steals 40 000 dollars.She takes off on a solo car journey to nowhere.She makes a very BIG mistake and stops over the night on bates motel............................Well it´s one of the greatest movies ever made.When I rent this I did not thought it would be scary(how can a 41-year old scary movie be scary)but I was wrong.Anthony Perkins acting is superb as Norman Bates.Watch it it´s really great!!!!!   rating: 5/5,10,1,5,16 June 2001
The Bridge on the River Kwai," A fantastic film experience!!!
",I have been in Thailand and to the real River Kwai bridge and in the reality it was much worse on a Japanese Prison Camp then you can see in the film but it´s still fantastic and VERY powerful.The acting by the great actor Alec Guinness is excellent and William Holden is also great.Even if the end is dark the film is very entertaining and sometimes even funny.The ``Colonel Bogey March'' is a really classic.I don´t know which film is best this or David Leans other film Lawrence of Arabia.A fantastic film experience.5/5,10,1,3,5 November 2001
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," 5/5
","I think that this is a very touching,sad and funny film with so fantastic actors(and thats the most important in this film) and also a fantastic direction by Milos Forman.a feisty misfit (Nicholson) enters an insane asylum and inspires his fellow patients to assert themselves, to the chagrin of strong-willed head nurse (Fletcher).Jack Nicholson doing his best role and also Louise Fletcher doing anamazing role.
RATING:5/5- a perfect film",10,1,3,13 September 2001
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," I love this film!!!!!!!!
","The last years the most of Disney´s films has been trash.For example Tarzan,Atlantis,The Hunchback of Notre Dame.........But Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was the first animated feature film and it´s still the best.I have loved this film all my life.It has some fantastic song numbers and it´s really a masterpiece.See this instead of the new Disney films.",9,1,2,24 November 2001
The Shawshank Redemption," Not perfect but still I recommend it very much because it´s a great film!
","This film should not be(as many else films)in top 3 of the 250 best films ever made.First I want to say something about the acting, that is one of the things that makes this one so good.Morgan Freeman is fantastic and so is Tim Robbins(both of them are very good actors even if Freeman is better).The script is also fantastic and the whole complex of the film is brilliant.
It´s a film that might will bring you to tears, even if it in the end goes to far and everything becomes silly.I mean it could they could have cut out the last fifteen minutes but it´s still a frightening film.The message in the film are that you will survive as long as you have hope.4,5/5",9,0,0,21 February 2002
Halloween," 8/10
","A great scary film with a major problem. It's a very entertaining film and even if it is a low-budget film, it's actually good special-effects. The film only got one problem: I have seen this before('Scream' 1,2 and 3, 'Valentine' 'I know what you did last summer' etc) but this was the first and must have been inspiring.",8,0,0,1 May 2002
Raging Bull," by far the BEST boxing film and one of the best American films ever made!!!
","This film really shows the boxer Jake La Motta´s life without a false note like in 'the hurricane'.The editing by Thelma Schoonmaker is fantastic(he won a Academy Award for it)and the direction by Scorsese is great.The boxing scenes are powerful and by far the best boxing scenes ever made. 
You can simply just say one thing about Robert De Niro´s acting: SUPERB.He´s acting is excellent.It has such a power and I think that this is he´s best role.This film is a masterpiece and one of the best American films ever made.5/5",10,1,1,29 October 2001
Shrek," Funny.Much better then Disney!!!!!!!!!!!!
",Maybe I would not place this on the 74 on the imdb top 250 films but it´s still hilarious funny both for kids and adults.Very funny voices(Eddie Murphy Cameron Diaz Mike Myers........)and the film is a spoof on other fairy tales and on Disney to and in the funniest scene of the movie it´s a spoof on the Matrix.4/5,8,0,0,6 November 2001
The Silence of the Lambs," Great entertainment, Great acting and very scary but not perfect!
","This is a classic horror movie of the 90's. The acting by Anthony Hopkins and a young Jodie Foster is great. The story has become a story that almost every new scary movie steals. If you see it today it might not be the same as when I saw it for over ten years ago. It is a really good scary film that includes much of everything. I still think the same has I have always thought about this film. It is not perfect, I don't think that it is a film that really touched me and I did not found it as a masterpiece.
Maybe the main problem is that you don't get to study the victims enough. I had also heard so much good films about it that I had too high thoughts about it. It is really worth watching but not one of the best scary movies ever. If you ask me I like the classic films that Hitchcock made better. It has been done many 'silence of the lambs'-look alike and also two sequels which is worth watching too. 8/10",8,0,0,12 January 2004
Ben-Hur," Good but aged!!!
","Some special effects have aged badly but the galley-slave sequence and the climactic chariot race (directed by Andrew Marton and staged by the legendary stunt expert Yakima Canutt)are still one of the best action scenes ever.
Rating: I give it a 4- out of 5",7,1,3,1 August 2001
Signs," Not a good film!
","First off all I have never liked Mel Gibson so I was not so happy to see him in M. Night Shyamalan's new film(I guess all of you know that he has done 'the sixth sense' and 'unbreakable'). And I did not like Mel Gibson or any of the other actors in this film, I did not thought that they were real bad but the film is very silly and also very slow. And in 'the sixth sense' I was really shocked at the end but in this the end was might not very expectable but I did not care about it.  Signs starts very slow and actually kind of boring and then goes on and I thought it included many VERY unrealistic and stupid things. But I must say that the cinematography is excellent and it includes some good moments but overall this is nothing to see. 4/10",4,2,3,18 September 2002
Amélie," A worm and funny film......
","This is a inspiring film. Very new-creating and it tells the story like if it was a fairy tale. It starts when Amelie is a child and her 'family' is not so funny to live in.Then Amelie grows up and if you meet her I am sure she will change your life!.Technical this film is fantastic, I mean the editing,direction and the cinematography is great.And Audrey Tatou is magnificent as Amelie.Both very cute and she also does a superb performance.I recommend this film because it´s a very worm and funny film.It should not be placed #13 in the top 250.It´s a film that will be remembered but still I would not place it in any top 100 lists.****½ (out of five)",8,0,1,2 February 2002
The Producers," Still after all these years this film is HILARIOUS...
","In Sweden when this film was released they called it 'The producers' but then it was no one who went and saw it.But they changed name on the film to 'Springtime for Hitler' and then it succeeded very good and  all since that Mel Brook´s have been popular in Sweden.It´s about a Broadway producer that is excellent played by Zero Mostel is making a play that's certain to flop(I won´t tell more of the story because it´s pretty complicated).Gene Wilder is also funny.Great screenplayI guess the best thing in the film is the famous 'Springtime for Hitler' number.I can compare this film to some of the best Marx Brothers films.You will laugh loud.It´s no comic masterpiece much because of that in some scenes it feels strong 1960´s aged.A bit like in 'the party'. I don´t know which one I like best this or 'Young Frankenstein'. My personal favorite of Mel Brook´s films is 'Blazing Saddles'.If you listen you can here Mel Brooks voice in the song number 'Springtime for Hitler', I heard it.Rating: 4,5 out of 5",9,0,0,31 January 2002
Rear Window," A WORK OF ART
","TRULY,ONE OF HITCHCOCKÂ´S BEST FILMS.ItÂ´s his most technical brilliant film and it must be very inspiring for new film makers.The acting is excellent by James Stewart,Grace Kelly and Thelma Ritter(Together they became a fantastic trio).The dialogue is wonderful,Cinematography some of the best I have seen(The whole film is in a apartment!),direction ...All that is perfect and this film is also a bit scary.Not my personal favorite Hitchcock(that is vertigo) but very close.The man was a genius and this is one of his BIG masterpieces.5/5",10,1,4,25 December 2001
The Matrix," Cool? yes.Good action scenes? Very good? no.
",Why is this film Ranked #36 in the top 250???? I just don´t understand it.I think it´s good entertaining excellent action scenes but nothing more.It´s 'cool' but honestly I don´t think that this film is more then special effects.I have seen it two or three times.I understand it and the story is good but not so fantastic interesting as you might can think.The acting is nothing special.First of all I don´t like Keanu Reeves so very much but Laurence Fishburne is good.Entertaining and great special effects but I can´t understand why this film is ranked #36 in the top 250.3/5,7,0,1,10 December 2001
Casino," Three explosive Mafia hours!!!!!
",By far Martin Scorsese`s best film but it´s very well acted and well directed.The bad thing in the movie is that Sharon Stone´s Character has no deep and she has a big part of the film.Still it´s a VERY brutal film that I recommend but if you are going to see a gangster film see Godfather instead.4/5,8,0,1,13 October 2001
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Not as good as Empire strikes back but still great!
",I would not placed this as number 8 of the 250 top movies. but I really like this movie. best in the movie are of course Harrison Ford as Han Solo.9/10,9,0,1,16 June 2001
Ran," I am impressed!!!
",This film is one of the most powerful films ever.The battle scenes is also some of the most spectacular and best battle scenes ever.The colors and the cinematography are masterful and the acting are superb.A fantastic epic about power.I think that I have seen the most of Kurosawa´s films he was the greatest director ever.5/5,10,0,3,15 December 2001
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," the best film in the trilogy.
","This is a little bit darker than the first one and it´s a little bit better.this is one of the best action/adventures ever made.I have watch this movie many times and it´s still as good as when you watch it the first time.
10/10",10,0,0,16 June 2001
Saboteur," Not first class Hitchcock but still entertaining.
",Some parts of it are very good and some parts are not as good.I have never liked the circus scene(it´s just very silly)but the end scene is superb.It has many of the classic Hitchcock moments and I liked it but it´s not first class Hitchcock.Still no one can´t say that this film is not entertaining.Good acting exciting but some parts of it are not great anymore.3+/5,7,1,3,19 January 2002
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Funny!
","Sean Connery and Harrison Ford is very good together. The Indiana Jones trilogy is good adventure films and of course 'Raiders of the lost ark' is the best one. Even if 'Raiders of the lost ark' is not so old it has aged because many other new adventure films has taken much of the elements from that film. ItÂ´s the same with part two and three even if they are only sequels. This one is funny, some small goofs but overall entertaining.6/10",7,0,0,28 March 2002
The Birds," 9/10........
","The master director Alfred Hitchcock has made a smart funny and maybea little scary film.Not as good as Psycho or North by North west but still great.A near masterpiece,there are only some things that make me not giving this film a 10.If you liked this movie you should see Psycho,North by North west and 39 steps and every other Hitchcock movie. 9/10",9,1,1,9 June 2001
The Godfather," A really masterpiece!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
","Everybody said that this film was the best ever done so I have wanted to see this for years(and the other parts I shall soon see).So when I found out that it would come on DVD I planned to buy it,and so I did. And when I saw it I thought it was an masterpiece.Perfect in every ways. The whole cast acts excellent and Marlon Brando really deserved his Oscar for best leading role.It´s also a very beautiful epic and the music is fantastic.I almost forgot to write that the direction by Francis Ford Coppola is also excellent.Still it has done better films than 'the Godfather' but it´s really a Masterpiece.If you don´t own the Godfather collection on DVD run out and buy it now.5/5",10,1,4,13 October 2001
