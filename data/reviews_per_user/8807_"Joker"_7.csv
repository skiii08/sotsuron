The Blair Witch Project," Creepy, Artistic, Good
","This is the kind of movie Hollywood SHOULD be making.  Movies were origionaly an artform, not a money generator.It is a very creepy movie.  It's the sort of movie that sends chills not jumps through the audience.I could relate to the characters because they are very natural in the partrail of the characters.  They seemed like real college students ;-). Moreover, there is a very realistic setting and plot.It's just plain good filmmaking.  One caution though.  I watched this with my brother and it made him motion sick.  All the footage is filmed by the actors.Go watch it... just because ;-)",8,0,0,4 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Movie, Star Wars, Entertaining
","Well,  what to say about this film.It was way over hyped.  I mean there is no way this movie (or any movie) could have lived up to all the stupid hype it's gotten.I loved the movie!  It was a great setup for the next two.  the FX are awesome, and the acting is just as good as it was in the first Star Wars.I have to feel sorry for poor Ewen.  He had some BIG shoes to fill! Critics are hacking the poor guy to bits.  I mean what are these guys looking for?  Obiously he can't be what Alec Guinness (Mr. Was-nominated-for-best-supporting-actor-in-first-Star-Wars).  Ewen does an excellent job of being a young Obi-Wan.My only complaint about Episode I was that the plot should have been expanded a little bit more, but what I forgot (and most other people) was that the original Star Wars didn't develop characters all that much, and the plot was rather simple.  It WAS a fun movie to watch.  I loved Episode I.  It was and is a fun movie to watch :).",10,17,26,25 May 1999
The English Patient," Hmmmmm
","I would like to say that I really didn't get this movie.  I found it to be a sad movie.  Everything about it is sad.  The woman cheats on her husband and everything goes hell after that.  It's been a long time sence I saw this movie last.  I recall that I couldn't have any sympathy for any of the characters (save the nice lady who helped Ralph's character) in the story. I also thought it drug in places.  I can see why it got 9 Acadamy awards, but for my tastes, it wasn't all that entertaining.  I mean, I can't root or feel sorry for sad characters.Overall though, it was interesting enough to keep me awake for 3 hours :).",6,0,5,16 December 1999
American Beauty," Worth my 7 bucks
","I liked this movie.  I'd see it again if I could get a date ;-). LOL  I may see it again anyway.  It will get best picture this year hands down (course I said that about Saving Private Ryan last year :).I liked the way the story unfolded.  I was able to predict the ending, but the motive was different than the one showed.  I can't tell any more than that.I also liked the extreamly sensual scenes!  What a Blast!",9,0,0,17 March 2000
Saving Private Ryan," Amen
","I'd like to say Amen to Allan-14's comment.  This movie is supposed to be a tribute to those who fought in war by showing the rest of us ignorant people what war is like.  I know you can't actually get there with a movie, but it made me not want to partake in the real thing.  And it gave me a whole new respect for those who have had the real thing.",10,0,0,20 January 1999
Saving Private Ryan," Pretty Darned Good :)
","Well... I saw this movie when it first came out.  I really didn't know what to expect, but I must say that I was impressed.  I have never seen camera direction quite like that.  Everything about this movie was very well done.I have spoken with a lot of vets and historians who said that was a pretty close to how things were on the front.  The only thing was that there was smoke on the beach which they couldn't put in the movie because we need to see what's going on.I'm a pretty young guy (young enough to be drafted), and that movie allowed me to know that I never have to go to combat.  Steven did a great job of almost putting me in the war.The sound is absolutely amazing!  I felt myself wanting to duck as the bullets whizzed by my head.I must confess that the fist time I saw SPR I was so caught up in the violence and intensity of the film the plot was somewhat muddled.  I was compelled to go back and watch it again though.  The second time around, it made a lot more sense and as a result, became a better movie to me.  It is now one of my top 5 films of all time.",10,1,2,11 January 1999
Blade Runner," Cool Sci-Fi
","Some pretty cool Sci-Fi!  It is nice and origiona.  I must say that I haven't seen the OC.  I have seen the DC, and it's pretty well done.This is the type of movie you have to sitdown and watch without getting up. Then you have to watch it again to get all the stuff you missed before. So if you didn't get it, Watch it again.",8,1,2,9 August 1999
