Catch Me If You Can," Very entertaining movie
","The best vehicle for Leonardo DiCaprio since Titanic, he outshines Tom Hanks in this true life story.  From the opening credits to the closing credits, this movie really makes you believe that you're back in the 60's, and keeps you going from beginning to end.  DiCaprio captures the part of the con-artist Frank Abagnale perfectly, in a very believable performance. He's 200 percent on the mark.  Tom Hanks is good as the detective, maybe not 100 percent on target but still good.  Christopher Walken is excellent as Abagnale's father.",10,0,1,21 January 2003
Interstellar," I just don't buy it.
","I'm guessing that a lot of the people who went to this movie - and wrote reviews - are science fiction buffs. I am not. But I do like a good movie, regardless of it's genre. And this wasn't it.The only thing that held the movie even slightly together is Matthew McConaughey. Otherwise it was totally unbelievable. The weather disturbances that are ruining the planet are unexplained. The protagonist just accidentally running into a secret NASA station is unbelievable. The 5 dimension thing is a cop out. Given the large budget for this movie, I'm surprised that they didn't have the kind of detailed and interesting settings and backdrops that one might expect in a movie that is almost 3 hours long.And don't forget to bring your hearing protectors. I luckily did bring mine since I have tinnitus in my ears. Even my 28db mufflers were barely enough, as the seats were shaking slightly in a few scenes. I think that it is irresponsible for the movie industry to have such dangerously high db levels with no notification or advisory label.Matthew McConaughey is at the peak of his career and has done some really great movies over the past few years. This one, however, is just a throw away.",1,7,14,14 November 2014
Casino Royale," Craig miscast
","A few brief comments. First, I liked Daniel Craig in other recent movies he's been in, like Layer Cake. But I think that he does best in a real, everyday kind of role, like Michael Caine. Secondly, there's a glib humor that you see in other Bond movies that is missing here, or at least a 'believable' glib humor. Again, I think that's because he does best in 'everyday guy' roles. Lastly, I found the fight scenes to be a bit freakish. Maybe it's just my age showing. Maybe the world has evolved too far downward for a Bond figure to be believable anymore. That's the challenge, to make a Bond (and a scenario) that is believable in today's world. But I do think that he gives it his best shot, and that it's a worthwhile movie to go to.",6,2,4,2 December 2006
Gangs of New York," Not believable
","Leonardo DiCaprio is once again caught in a historically flawed movie, only this time much worse than Titanic.  I grew up in lower Manhattan and am a history buff.  This movie is very, very overdone.  Way too 'Hollywood', too 'stagey' (like that fight at the beginning, give me a break), over-violent, and (as in Titanic) with an liberal smattering of historical cliches.  If the Five Points area was as depicted, everyone would have been dead ten times over.  Not to say that it wasn't a very bad neighborhood, but it, and the characters, were not believable.  DiCaprio was miscast as a tough guy (unlike in 'Catch Me If You Can' where he was cast perfectly), although he did very well, given that limitation.  The only reason that I give this movie even a 5 rating is that Daniel Day-Lewis gives an absolutely riveting performance as William the Butcher.",2,4,9,21 January 2003
