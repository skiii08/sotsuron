The Blair Witch Project," I should have warned you!!!
","My apologies to all those Cinema goers in the rest of the world. I feel as though you should have been warned you that if you go to see this 'home video, you'll feel as though you've been hugely ripped off. I did! I saw BWP in my local cinema; a place where I have known people to stand and applaud at the end of a film (sad but true). The only reaction when this one finished was an audible groan and mutterings of 'was that it?'.The best way to describe it is annoying. The jumpy, grainy picture is annoying. The constant bickering and profanity is annoying. The huge holes in the story (go downstream!!) are annoying and, above all, the totally unsatisfactory ending is annoying. I sat and watched past the credits just in case they'd snuck something in to explain what had been going on!
OK, having said all of the above, it does have one thing going for it. It's got people talking about films (at the time of typing, there are over 1900 other comments posted). It's provoked a reaction, be it good or bad, and there haven't been that many films recently that have done that. Unfortunately for me the reaction is negative, but I will remember the film.",1,2,3,11 November 1999
Titanic," Is Titanic the best movie ever?
","I don't think so! OK so it managed to collect nine Oscars (I think), but look at the categories it failed to scoop: Best Actor (not even nominated), Best actress, Best supporting Actor, Best supporting Actress and, probably the most damning, Best Writing - screenplay written directly for the screen.The special effects are spectacular, and the cinematography and direction overall are very good, but there's not enough in this film to hold your attention. The first hour and a half are just not interesting!! I watched this movie when it was released I assumed that all the hype surrounding it had raised my level of expectation too high. I watched it again last night and ended up going to bed after about an hour.The other nominations for best picture in 1998 were As good as it gets, Good Will Hunting, The Full Monty and L.A. Confidential. If you want to see a good film watch any of these, you won't be disappointed.",Null,3,5,11 November 1999
