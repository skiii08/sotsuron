Walk the Line," Uncanny Joaquin Phoenix performance in average bio-pic
","Phoenix's portrayal of Johnny Cash's singing is absolutely uncanny. True, its pitchy on a couple of the low notes in Folsom Prison Blues, but he has almost all of the nuances in the tone perfect. The guitar playing is adequate, but the riffs that made Cash famous aren't quite there, but no complaints. There was only one Johnny Cash. This is truly an unbelievable performance, matched only by Kevin Spacey's singing of Bobby Darin tunes in Beyond the Sea.Reese Witherspoon is also good, singing as June Carter, who was always in Johhny's 'big fat shadow' in real life. If you're a June Carter fan, you'll love the singing. If you're like me, just sort of knew she was Johnny's wife, then the singing won't do much for you, although Reese does an excellent job in her portrayal.Aside from the two outstanding performances by the stars, the move is your average predictable bio-pic. I thought it was a remake of 'Ray'--tormented by losing a brother, starts out as nobody, struggles, gets good, gets into drugs and (POSSIBLE SPOILER) is finally rehabilitated and becomes immortal.",5,1,3,9 June 2006
Ocean's Twelve," Disjointed confusing plot and photography
","Clooney and cohorts are back with a predictable script--the owner of the Bellagio, the victim in the first movie, wants his money back even though he has already been paid by his insurance company (defamation lawsuit anybody) and through some convoluted plot sequence it is determined that Clooney has 2 weeks or is it a month, or is it Monday afternoon, to do something. On-screen notes give time lines, but it is never certain what the time lines are for--either getting the money back, or the second heist, or the date the Bellagio owner is going to do away with Clooney. The ending makes no sense so I can't spoil it because I never really got it. However, it should be noted that Albert Finney as the real mastermind thief and Bruce Willis as himself are both uncredited--probably at their own request. Although Julia Roberts plays the role of Ocean's wife Tess, she also is uncredited--the credits actually state, 'and introducing Tess as Julia Roberts.' Julia's probably hoping people will think it wasn't her, especially since she wore no makeup (evidently to make her role as a housewife more believable.) IMDb won't let me give a lower rating than 1 star, but a one half star each for Catherine Zeta-Jones' and George Clooney's looks does add up to 1 star total.",1,6,9,2 March 2005
