The New World," One of the worst films i've ever seen
",a Waste of money and of actors. The film starts out OK but turns into a woeful ramble of self indulgent pointless camera angles and drivelling dialogue. The little Pocahontas type is a rubbish actor and although i'm a big fan of Colin Farrel and Christian Bale they are wasted in this pitiful excuse for a movie. I would rank this film right down there with Frankie the Fly ( Dennis Hoppers worst movie) and ooh let me see. Its tough .. Its worse than water world AND the postman ... Its dreadful . do yourself a favour and side step this one. I was swearing at the television at the end as the DVD drew to close . I cant seem to muster any more words for this drivel. Drivel nonsense.,1,1,6,6 December 2006
