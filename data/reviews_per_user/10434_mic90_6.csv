Iron Man 3," Iron Man 3 is smart movie
","Warning: spoiler alerts:It was have been few months after The Avengers. New York City is once again saved. The hero himself has experience a lot hard times in his mind. He can't just quit and suddenly there is new terror. The mysteries leader named the Mandarin came to the town with his terrorist. The city needs once again Iron Man. But this even him can't to do nothing and he have to leave New York to create the plan to stop the MandarinRobert Downey Jr is always fantastic and Iron Man 3 offered more than action scenes. The script is not just full of the effects and the fighting. Like the first film, the hero is vulnerable and that is good thing.'Some call me a terrorist. I consider myself a teacher. America. Ready for another lesson?' – the MandarinBen Kingsley is bullseye for the movie. His performance was good and memorable. His voice created 'Darth Vader vibes'. Ben's performance radiate such a power that hopefully the audience remember his role. Even that the twist got 'huh?' feelings but it definitely not made the role worse. Its just tell how smart the story is. I like that the villains are not one-dimensional the characters. Overall the cast is perfect as usually in Iron Man movies. Gwyneth Paltrow showed more than the skin. She did good job and the script offered more than scream and the hero saves in every scenes. She actually acted and was equal with Downey Jr and others. Example The Amazing Spider-Man crew should take advice that how can write good role for female. Don Cheadle's performance was smooth and perfect partner to Tony Stark. I would see him War Machine solo film.The special effects looked cool, realistic and the crew doesn't went to over-the-top. Only the final battle needed more imagination. But still the movie is smart and effects are better than in Man of Steel movie. Marvel Studio films are like one big movie. That' why we have to look these movies with a bigger scales. The first Iron Man saved Downey Jr career and he has taken recently many different roles. I think that this was his final Iron Man solo movie to him.Iron Man 3 is the perfect ending to the Iron Man trilogy. One of the best Marvel movies so far. Hollywood bosses should think more than twice that do they want continue with the character or bring new the characters to the big screens. I feel that Downey Jr will look another projects after The Avenger 3. His performance as Tony Stark/Iron Man Is so memorable that it will hard to any actor replace the role.",8,16,25,26 March 2014
Man of Steel," Too much special effects
","Warning: spoiler alerts 'You will give the people an ideal to strive towards. They will race behind you, they will stumble, they will fall. But in time, they will join you in the sun. In time, you will help them accomplish wonders' Jor-El (Russell Crowe).Over 70 years ago. Joe Shusten and Jerry Siegel created a superhero which saw daylight in those days. The character were the first superhero which success created a massive changes and brought new era to superheroes. It was golden age to writers. Back then heroes were pure and traditional hero without darkness. There wasn't anti-heroes like Wolverine which reminded Hollywood icons like Clint Eastwood. Superman is always have been popular character and original concept is same like before. Until Zack Snyder took the film to directing.Reboots are big word on nowadays Hollywood. Man of Steel started again Superman's story. But this time in shortly way. The movie starts on the planet named Krypton which.. well every fan know how the story starts. Reboot worked very well in Batman Begins. Christopher Nolan's name is now 'hot' and pure gold to the studios. He was one of the producers In this movie. Does his name helped and was man of steel good reboot like Batman? Unfortunately 'the gold finger's' touch wasn't that powerful.The cast is a-list. Kevin Costner and Diane Lane nailed their roles in good way. Amy Adams were good in Lois Lane role but like many other love interest roles it became 'lady in trouble' style and acting was not main thing. Michael Shannon as Zod was interesting choice. But the script was biggest problem that his performance was boring and unmemorable. Henry Cavill sounded good in the hero role. But once again the the story is full of special effects and the story suffered a little bit. He was like The Terminator/robot. At least he smiled a few times. The best thing in whole movie was Russell Crowe as Jor-El. I will not compare him to Marlon Brando's performance. In this movie Jor-El got more action and larger role.The visual side looked cool but some action scenes effects went to in the video game style. Not good at all. The movie has many action scenes and the battle between Superman and General Zod was quite good but boring. It reminded a lot of The Matrix Revolution final battle. Biggest problem was that Superman wasn't Superman in the end. I know that he was the rookie in this film. But Zack Snyder with his team took away man of steel morality and 'I don't kill' attitude was gone.Man of Steel is an entertaining movie and I will wait a long awaited Superman Vs Batman movie",7,1,2,24 March 2014
Paranormal Activity," Very overrated a horror movie.
","Paranormal Activity is a good example how much the media has the power to making a such a hype around in the movies. This film can't handle a time so you can only watch once. Okay that 'ghost story' succeeded to making a little bit that viewer got a cold tremors but and attention go on through the movie. This isn't a masterpiece but is still one of the best Hollywood horror films for the last few years.If other horror filmmakers would come back to film like in 'good old times' when horror movie was horror movie and not just making those teenager films. So if there would be a more ghost stories like Paranormal Activity, then this film wouldn't ever got that hype and success.",6,0,1,26 February 2010
Avatar," A visual masterpiece but i expected more...
","Like in many reviews, Avatar is stunning with amazing visual effects and planet named Pandora offer a much eye of the candy for fans which loves special effect movies. James Cameron created a whole new way making the movies. Motion capture offer give to actors more spaces for improve they performances and making believable characters. And we can only hope that we not gonna see anymore those some awful characters like in the Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones movie.Nowadays Hollywood doesn't care about a much about the story and quality. Money solve$ many things and that's why special effects got too big part in the movies. In Avatar is an typical grow up story and which have been told a many times. But James Cameron lift it up from dozens movies group because he is still A STORYTELLER and damn good director. But if others could do focused more to quality, Avatar couldn't been a such big deal what is it now. Unfortunately the hype take a over and fans go to see/watch just for special effects and 3D. There are is still a strong message and themes.All that hype, Avatar would have been a 'flop' but James Cameron handled it very well and remeeded almost all expectations. But Avatar a bit suffer same reason like many other blockbuster films. There are no much background stories about the planet and characters are like papers. Sorry fans, but i expected more. So i ask very clearly: Cameron wrote that movie a many years in his mind so why he didn't made a better the story and took a many elements from other movies etc.. The movie visual side is fantastic but i expect that the story would have been a stronger.There has a much speculations about Zoe Zoldana and her Oscar-nomination. But it is worthy to win? Off course a strong female roles should get more attention because 'actresses' like Megan Fox and Kirsten Stewart dominate box offices and get too much attention. So it is a like upper that 'a real' actress got in the good movie with an amazing role which did not just based on actresses sexiness.But one actor is a very underrated and deserve more. A year 2009 was Sam Worthington's . He raised in the international star for the Terminator Salvation film like in one night. Even that Avatar's script suffers for little incomplete story, Sam's character grow trough the movie but in the end Sam's charisma and acting skills do it rest. So he is a quite good actor and i wish that he continue to do more good roles.9/10",7,1,3,21 January 2010
Les Misérables," Very good film
","In 19th-century France, Jean Valjean, who for decades has been hunted by the ruthless policeman Javert after breaking parole, agrees to care for a factory worker's daughter. The decision changes their lives for ever.The story works very well. From my point of view Tom Hooper took a high risk and won a big game. He did not chose easiest path to make this movie. Every actor sang and these performances recorded on the set. The best performance comes from Anna Hathaway. Her 'I Dreamed a Dream' Hugh Jackman did also good job but. Russell Crowe's performance reminded a lot Johnny Depp's performance in Sweeney Todd film. They are not singers and that's why the movie suffers. Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter brings a light elements to the story. Les Misérables is masterpiece which won't work for everybody. If you like musicals, watch this and enjoy.",8,0,0,22 May 2015
The Wolverine," Marvels Dirty Harry is back!
","Warning: spoiler alerts.Its already sixth the Wolverine role for Hugh Jackman. But I will not complain. He is still perfect and always give everything in his role. X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009) was very disappointing. The movie got too much the characters and the special effects took the lead and the story suffered a lot. Also the character were much more tamed than Bryan Singers movies. It also proposed the girls too much with Jackman's shirtless body and typical Hollywood explosions. Wolverine's 'animal side were minimal'.The Wolverine based on the comic book created by Frank Miller and Chris Claremont. In the story Logan travel to the Japan to learn from samurai's. The film is and independent sequel to X-Men: The Last Stand (2006). For the paper it would have been a very bad idea but the script is much better than in X3 movie. Jean Grey appears to Logan's mind every night to him and Logan doesn't want forget her.The hero lives in Alaska. Suddenly he got invitation to the Japan to meet an old friend. Logan saved him a long time ago. Logan travels to the Japan to say goodbyes. The journey went to unfriendly and Logan will face his demons again and chance to become mortal.The crew has learned a lot from the first Wolverine solo movie. This time there are not too much mutants and this time the hero itself is central of the story. Hugh Jacman shines again in the leading role. His muscles are bigger than ever. The cast is wonderful and not well-known but it does not bothered at all.The special effects looked cool and they kept these minimal. There are not much action scenes but when the action starts these looks good. Especially fight on the bullet train looked damn cool. Unfortunately in the end of the movie the ideas started reminded too much typical action movie. Maybe they didn't knew what they wanted. The final fight felt rushed. It was very disappointment. Next time something new, please.James Mangold did a fantastic job as the director and hopefully he continue in the sequels. Overall The Wolverine is enjoyable and one of the best superhero movies.",8,1,2,26 March 2014
