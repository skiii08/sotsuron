Requiem for a Dream," Oh my my
",Everytime I watch this movie it just gets me. The movie is brutally honest and please do not watch it at night. Not for the light hearted. Many would not understand the movie but those who do will love the movie. It's a big thumbs up from my side.,10,1,1,28 August 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," Highly Overrated..!!
","I mean I don't get it why this movie came in the top 250 movies in IMDb. I am not saying that this is a bad movie but the best super hero movie ever? People have just have just made up their minds that it's avengers so it must be a very good movie. The pervious avengers movie were better than this one. In this movie everything was scattered, the good thing was that they connected everything with the previous marvel movies that is why I gave it a 5 rating or else I wouldn't have given it that also. The end especially, people are left clueless as to what is about to happen. Only that person will know who has actually read the comics. I was shocked to see that this movie is above Fight Club!! I mean what on earth are people thinking? This is just my view on it though but I don't think this was a good movie, there was just a lot of hype created for this movie because which people actually started believing that this is the greatest movie ever made while in reality it was just an average movie.",5,34,70,2 May 2018
