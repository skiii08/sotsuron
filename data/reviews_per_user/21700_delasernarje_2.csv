Black Swan," Such a perfect narcissism threat for the audience
","Nina Sayers has just reached the title of new Swan Queen for this bizarre, dark, twisted and nightmarish version of the Swan Lake ballet story, but she is not prepared for what she will become with this new chance in her life as a ballerina, as a woman and, the most important, as a person.This movie is such an incredible masterpiece a I saw a few years ago, and it doesn't stop to surprise me in lots of ways. What Darren Aronofsky has created in this piece of filmmaking is such a rare case of what I could call 'the perfect movie'.However, this movie is the type of film which you will completely love, or you probably are gonna absolutely hate, why?, 'cause its genre is not an easy step for commercial audience (even when the special effects, cinematography and direction makes it great for the marketing). It's like mixing Fight Club with Mulholland Drive, I mean, you are looking at an art-house film with a psycho-sexual story on it. So, if you like these types of films, it's likely for you to love it.The superficial story is not very complex. It does get really messed up and confusing for the viewer but, nothing you would figure out after you've watched it. Nevertheless, when you try to reach for the psychological meaning of it, I mean, when you try to reach its depth, it will become an indomitable monster 'cause it really makes it to have a billion of interpretations on it, but, in my case, that's the best from this!In fact, when you first see Black Swan, you'll probably buy the 'sweet, sexually-repressed girl going deep in darkness for an impossible role in a world where nothing is perfect... blah blah blah' but, is it really like that? When you absolutely go deep in the story, you will discover lots of terrific things that makes this movie even better than the first time you saw it... In my opinion, when the story takes place, you'll know you are in front of an incredible depiction of a narcissistic artist that destroys the perceptions and identities of the female gender and sexuality, just to expose a new and 'perfect' (in therms of Aronofsky utopia) woman called 'Black Swan'The ending is the most ambiguous part in the movie, and it will give lots of different interpretations to the whole motion picture. Hope you give this movie a second try, and make it worth it, 'cause saying this movie is about the costs of perfection and how the lead character goes crazy 'cause of that, is like saying Star Wars is about aliens wanting to destroy other aliens... is just plain ridiculous and does not reveal anything new.",10,1,2,7 July 2014
Gone Girl," A future classic and a very important movie for nowadays
","I was pretty sure that Fincher would not disappoint his audience with this film, and I was right. The movie is simply great! It's very dark, heavy and has one of the most memorable messages of these days. Have you ever asked yourself why do people marry? if they know who they are marrying? Well, that's something this film is dealing with.I have just read lots of negative comments for the film and 1. The ending is not stupid, it's real life, or what would have you done in that case?; 2. Inception was not intelligent... it is plain overrated (for me); and 3. The movie is getting really good with the messages it tries to deal with.I say it is an important film for these days 'cause it dealt with a very peculiar topic that's getting bigger today: feminism. I think the movie really shows how stupid and suggestible people could be because of the sensationalism of TV notices. This film gives a whole new meaning to the word 'feminism'; don't get me wrong, I believe in the equality of sexes in every aspect, but you need to accept that some women can be as wrong as any man. And, also, it portrays the masculine role in its weakest phase. Damn, men can be really stupid!",10,5,16,8 October 2014
