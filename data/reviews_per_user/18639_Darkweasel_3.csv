The Ring," An Object Lesson in How To Ruin A Great Film...
","The Tagline: Before you die, you see the ring. The Reality: When you see The Ring, you die of boredom.What a surprise. Hollywood hears of an original idea from another country and then maliciously sets out to ruin it. And once again the mission has been successfully accomplished. In a nutshell: An urban legend about a killer video-tape attracts the attention of a female reporter after one of her relatives apparently dies seven days after watching it. She watches it herself and then receives a phone call telling her that she too will die in seven days. Not surprisingly, she freaks out and gets her ex-boyfriend/husband/whatever to watch it too. Then her (apparently psychic) son also watches the tape and so she sets out to uncover the mystery of the killer video before her and/or everyone else dies in unimaginative ways. To say any more would ruin the outcome of the far superior Japanese original.There are so many things wrong with this film, it would take too long to name them all so here are some statistical highlights:2 x Unnecessary characters.1 x Scene stolen from The Omen. 2 x cases of unexplained psychic children.4 x cases of Wooden acting.2 x Dodgy mannequins2 x Hilarious 'Terrified to death' victim make-ups.1 x Line of truly awful dialogue.1 x viewer who will never trust a remake ever again (Although I    did actually say that after Psycho too).
Anyway, I'm off to watch the new version of The Italian Job now. D'OH!",Null,0,1,6 August 2003
The Hunger Games," Flawed but still reasonably entertaining.
","First things first. Firstly, no, I haven't read the books. Secondly, writing this as a 40 year old bloke, I have had to realise that The Hunger Games may not exactly be directed towards my specific demographic. Therefore, looking at it a little differently, like maybe I was writing this as a 15 year old girl who liked good looking boys, fearless heroines and had never seen Big Brother, The Truman Show, Battle Royale, The Running Man, or Logan's Run then I would have to say it was the bestest, most originalest film I've ever seen. LOL.Er, so anyway... It's the old dystopian future scenario but this time, and as well as featuring some dubious looking wigs, comedy teeth, and daft costumes, the future now has twelve Districts and a Capitol, and each year two teenagers (1 boy and 1 girl) are chosen to fight in something called The Hunger Games. What the Hunger Games are is never fully explained and is all a bit confusing as everybody looks healthy and very well fed indeed.Trained and mentored by drunk-one-moment-completely-coherent- the-next Woody Harrelson, our good looking hero and ballsy heroine types have to fight 22 other 'Tributes' to the death to become the eventual winner. A flimsy reason for this is given and glossed over by a perpetually grumpy Donald Sutherland who plays his character with all the depth of a surly pantomime villain. But, I have to remember, I am a fifteen year old girl so I probably don't notice these kind of things. So off we go into the woods full of baddies, genetically engineered wasps, the occasional help package, some magic dogs, and out of place love stories. Truth be told though, once the action starts and the pace picks up it's not actually too bad. During some parts, even to someone as weary and over-the-hill as myself it actually became quite enjoyable. Sure, it had to make some sacrifices to get it out to a wider (younger and more impressionable) audience, in that the violence is so toned down that even though over twenty people are killed, only a couple of them show any signs that their bodies actually contained blood in the first place.Still, as enjoyable as some of it is, the lack of explanation to certain things (what's that three fingered salute all about?) and the glossing over of major plot points make the film something far less that great. And without trying to give the ending away, are we really expected to believe that in 74 years of the Hunger Games, and with seemingly every base covered with evil strategies and aided by some seriously superfangled technology, the situation we're faced with at movie's climax has never once arisen before and has absolutely no contingency plan in place to nullify it? Apparently, there are one or two more films still to come so I can only hope they serve to shed more light on an enjoyable, if very flawed first film.6.5/10",6,0,2,11 September 2012
The Fast and the Furious," Point Break but with Cars. (Trust me, that's a good thing...)
","I've got to be honest. My expectations were low, I couldn't be bothered to watch it at the cinema, I couldn't even be bothered to rent the DVD. I waited until it was on satellite so I didn't have to pay money out to watch it. I am a fool. It was hugely enjoyable. Sure, there was no plot, the acting ranged from average to awful, the love story was pointless and left unresolved, the story(?) was obvious, as was the ending, but still after all that, I loved it.If you liked Point Break, then you'll love this because it's basically the same film. Street car racing replaces surfing, Vin Diesel replaces Patrick Swayze, Paul Walker replaces Keanu Reeves and high speed robberies replace bank raids. I look forward to the night when they're shown together as a double bill so I can add alcohol, pizza, some drunk friends, flick the switch in my brain firmly to 'Off', and then have a night of loud, explosive mindless fun. Excellent.",Null,0,1,4 March 2003
