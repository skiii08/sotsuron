Lucky Number Slevin," Not well known... and it is not deserved
","Lucky Number Slevin (Just Slevin in France) is a good movie, perhaps not a masterpiece but from my opinion, an above average half noir movie.It is not completely dark but close to it. The choice of the flat, colors, clothes also reflects this.The play goes from very good to excellent, well, as I list the cast, I expected no more but I was not disappointed.The story, is good, some say, they have guessed the final. Sure, but sometimes, who cares, it is not the end the important thing, it is the path you take to reach it. And what a path and a journey, did they make! A loose guy, a killer, a coroner, two mob lords, their minions... shake all of them and enjoy!",10,0,0,8 August 2017
Pretty Woman," Funny movie, quite entertaining
","The poor girl and the prince up to dated to the 80's.
Quite a fairy tale, a good movie to spend a good time. My two favorite caracters are the director (Hector Elizondo) of the hotel and the night elevator operator(Patrick Richwood) that bring some touchs of humor of different kinds.... but the director is brilliant!",8,1,1,5 April 2020
Prometheus," Well ...
","It seems Ridley needs some vacations...Between the crew of the vessel that's seems to be hired at the closing of a pub and the so-called scientists who have break almost every rule to apply in archeology, biology or exploration...As for the theory or the facts in the movie (DNA for example), I just prefer to forget it. I generally prefer a minimum of real bases in a scifi movie or book.You have some time to loose and really nothing else to do... you can watch Prometheus",3,1,3,30 August 2017
Alien: Covenant," Long and boring watching
","OK let's face it .... apart the beginning scene between David and his creator, the rest is boring, without any surprise. The playing is sadly not very good ant the plot seems to have been written by a child : let's say the alien is running after them...The main issue in these new films is they are really not close to reality. How many people will take off their helm in a new world just because the air is breathable? How many will land on a planet without doing a basic mapping before... Answer is : every equipage in alien do this...",1,2,4,16 November 2017
