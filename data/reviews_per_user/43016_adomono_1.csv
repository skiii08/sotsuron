","i like SW just as much as the next person. but this one..how can i say it w/o being rude... oh forget it...this one nearly SUCKED!granted it is the most stunning visual effects film i have ever seen.the pod race was GREAT.DARTH MUAL RULES..(as the best villain on film)...i was almost rooting for him....he should have had more screen timejar-jar banks, phu-lease Mr.Lucas, kill him off BEFORE episode 2natalie portman....a mixture of cher and karen allen..(from, Raiders) did she raid 'LaBelle's costume closet?i KNOW this is just the beginning a set up for 2 & 3 so it's forgivable but i didn't see why people were waiting in line for 4 t0 6 weeks and some shelling out between $100-$1000. i just walked up to the box office paid $18.00 for 4 tickets and walked right in no lines-no problemlook IT'S STAR WARS go see it-you need to because i feel 2 & 3 are gonna kick assNote to Mr.Lucas....if there is any way you can bring back darth maul w/o looking too stupid (i know it's impossible...but hey, if 'Bobby Ewing' can come back from the dead, why can't he)i would love it!god bless you alland 'may the force be with you'",Null,0,1,21 May 1999
