The Longest Yard," the best
",this comedy is very very funny. I was laughing from the begging to the end and i can't stop laughing some times when i think about it.It teaches you a lesson on what the importance of what true loyalty means. it teaches you that no matter how tough life gets to never walk with your head down. it also teaches you at the same time that no matter how much someone put you down you don't have to be what they have perceived you to be. Adam Sandler and Chris Rock are also a good pair together the the cast of this movie is very talented and funny. I will be seeing this movie another time to get more laugh on.anyone who hasn't seen it should definitely do so.,10,1,4,18 June 2005
