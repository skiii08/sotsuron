Ford v Ferrari," As Vintage and Classy as a scotch straight out of the cask!!!
","There are movies that give you 100% of what you expected and there are movies which exceed expectations in every way possible and blow your mind away. Documenting the le Mans race of '66, this team has delivered a vintage classic that is as classy as a scotch straight out of the cask after maturing for decades!Set up in the 60's, the Ford Motor Company is in pursuit of a new design that will take them back to the glory days. Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) gets a path-breaking idea from his marketing team to design a Race Car, like the legendary Ferrari. After failing in an attempt to buy out Ferrari which is broke, Ford decides to build a race car on its own and commissions Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) for the job. Shelby takes the help of Ken Miles (Christian Bale), a hot-tempered British racer who is struggling to make both ends meet. While Miles's addition to the team adds tremendous improvement to the design, the Marketing Head Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas) wants him out of the team. How Shelby and Miles manage to achieve the American dream of winning against a Ferrari at le Mans is the remaining plot.What fascinates the audience is that the movie starts like a documentary and picks up pace in no time to make everyone watch it literally at 7000rpm. Whether a person is into cars or not, the detailing given to every aspect of a race car and how it is tested and done is prone to give a 'car-gasm'. Christian Bale and Matt Damon will definitely be serious contenders for the Oscars along with Leonardo Di Caprio, Brad Pitt and Joaquin Phoenix this year. Their transformation into the role is top class. Another noteworthy character is Josh Lucas portraying Leo Beebe. While he is pure evil as a personality, he is a pure genius at what he does and how he gets it done. Thank God for this is just not a 1hr30mins affair. The movie runs for a good 2hrs32mins and it was still not enough.Pure Gold!!!",10,3,8,16 November 2019
The Irishman," Blended Scotch, 50yrs!
","On a lazy weekend evening, you have the rest of the day all for yourself to kill, with a bottle of Scotch in your hand. 'The Irishman' will definitely be your perfect company to savour.Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro), a World War 2 veteran, narrates his time as a hitman. 'Painting the house' as they call it, Frank does the hitman jobs for Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci), the head of North Eastern Pennsylvania Crime Family and Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino), the head of International Brotherhood of Teamsters in the 50s to 70s. Hoffa gets into trouble when President JFK's brother, Attorney General Robert F Kennedy arrests him. While President Nixon grants him a conditional pardon, Hoffa does things that does not go well with other crime families.The movie runs for a 3.5hrs and if you enjoy the language of the 60s/70s and a fan of De Niro and Al Pacino, you will have a blast watching this. The plot as such is complex with too many supporting characters, happening over a 30-year period. Yet, the screenplay keeps us interested throughout with its twists and turns happening in the lives of Sheeran - Russell-Hoffa trio. Another noteworthy element is the deep-fake of the characters' younger versions that is seamless.Go for it!",10,4,9,2 December 2019
Joker," A new hope for DC!
","'Every story needs its hero. And its villain. And its monster.'
The Caped Crusader of Gotham City was never complete without his villain, the Joker. What made The Dark Knight (2008) a phenomenal success at the box office and as an all time cult classic was the characterization of the agent of chaos and seamless delivery of witful dialogues and challenges. It wasn't a surprise that the people loved the Joker more than the Batman himself in the film, for he, the Joker, didn't have any rules to play by. It was unfortunate that Heath Ledger had to leave this world, and thus creating a permanent vacuum in the Gotham City. There had been attempts by Jared Leto to fulfill the gap, but it is no match.DC had to come up with a solo Joker movie that was due for long. Joaquin Phoenix had been creating the buzz ever since the first look poster arrived and looks-wise he was almost..almost matching the legend of Heath Ledger. With much expectations, the Joker is finally here.Set in 1981, Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is a disregarded personality who works as a clown at places wherever needed and lives with his mom Penny. With a rare neurological condition, he suffers from frequent and inopportune laughter which irks people around him. The city as such is infested with crime and unemployment all over, hence there is no question of sympathy or concern for special characters such as him. Struggling to make a mark as a stand up comedian, Arthur also suffers from delusions where he is unable to distinguish reality from dreams. Things go topsy-turvy when one of his colleagues hands him over a gun to take care of miscreants who harm him. Arthur uses it against 3 rogue employees of Wayne Enterprises. While the cops are in search for Arthur, he also is in constant battle to come up as a comedian, pursue his neighborhood crush, find out the true identity of his father and take care of his mom. When he finds an answer to most of these, how he handles them and emerges as the Gotham City rebellion is the plot.The movie has its high moments in the seamless change of expressions and body language of Joaquin. The audience will be in for a shock to see his shirtless episodes where he reminds one of Christian Bale from The Machinist (2004 The background score in most places takes the cue from The Dark Knight and builds over it to make us feel the connect. Also there are too many frames that resemble the ones of Heath Ledger, which possibly could be a deliberate attempt. ). For those expecting a Batman cameo in this movie - the answer is both YES and NO.While this movie could easily be a grandeur in performances, one cannot get the rush that was given by the one played by Heath Ledger. Surely, there cannot be a comparison to the 2008 Joker version, for that set its standards too high that any more attempts can only keep trying to scale up half way. We can only hope the sequel to this one has much more interesting elements, for the movie ends with enough scope for that hope!",7,2,2,16 November 2019
It Chapter Two," Spine-Chilling!
","'Swear... Swear if It isn't dead... if It ever comes back... we'll come back, too' said Bill in the closing frames of Chapter 1 to his fellow Losers Club mates, in Sep'1989. The Urban Legend at Derry said It will be back once every 27 years and we always knew It is going to be back again to haunt us on screens and in our dreams. It is Sep'2016 and Pennywise is back!Bill, Beverly, Ben, Richie, Eddy and Stan - the members of Losers Club back in 1989, all lead a life far away from Derry, in a hope to put back the horrible memories and move on for better. One fine day, they all receive a call from Mike, another member of the club who chose to stay back at Derry. The moment they hear him talk, they all could feel the chills already and they know It is back. Bound by the blood swear they made 27 years ago, they all have no choice but to get to Derry immediately to stop the Clown from taking more lives. Stan alone is not able to face It once again and commits suicide before even he could get there. Mystery unfolds at Derry when Mike convinces the rest on a ritual that needs to be performed by all of them to destroy It once for all. The only condition- each member needs to go alone and collect an artifact from their past that needs to be placed in the ancient pottery. In pursuit of the artifact, each one sets course separately just to experience more and more horror inflicted by Pennywise before they could collect it. Whether the Losers were able to succeed in their mission, is the rest of the plot.IT stands unique in what it offers in comparison to other horror genres. While Conjuring, Insidious, Annabelle etc have their equally fair share of spine-chilling moments, IT also gets on to one psychologically. The very fact that It targets children and takes them in the most gruesome way possible makes us subconsciously detest what's about to come in the next to next frames. Also the graphic content that is shown on screens cannot be unseen for so many nights. While most of the Losers are shown to have moved on, Andy Muschietti (Director) has subtly driven the point that nothing gets away from the clutches of the curse, by showing that they are only going through the same at a different place. Bill, is still caught up in the mystery of what happened to Georgie and turns up as a mystery writer. Beverly escaped an abusive father only to get stuck with an abusive husband. Eddie moved away from his mom's control, just to get controlled by his wife all time. Stan as always is never courageous enough to confront. Mike never left Derry. Richie used his loud mouth and foul language for better. The only person who has actually become better and stronger is Ben, who has lost weight and is an architect now. The detailing given to every character and how they confront their fears makes the movie run longer and longer. Except for that, IT Chapter 2 delivers what it promised.",8,0,0,16 November 2019
