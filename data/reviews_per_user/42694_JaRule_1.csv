The Rock," SE IT
","The rock is one of the best action movies i've ever seen. Those who have not seen it, shame on you. The only thing i've regret is that i didnt see it on cinema. It got exelent actors and music. The story is has never been put on the screen in a better way. (terror VS Good old fashion USA)",10,3,4,24 July 2002
