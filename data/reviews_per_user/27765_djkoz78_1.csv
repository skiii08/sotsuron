Skyfall," Skyfall probably the most emotional Bond film I've seen.
","I have read several user reviews and I respect everyone's opinion however I must disagree. Out of all the reviews I've seen most of them universally hated the film. Most of the time I'm on the side of my fellow IMDb users because I usually will read the so-called professional film critics and then completely ignore what they say and make up my own dang mind. I've also found that I trust most of the USER reviews over most Film Critics to be perfectly honest. Alas this seems to be one of the rare times I disagree with the users and actually agree with the critics. (GASP!) I know it shocked me too.I'll try to keep this spoiler free as best as possible in fact I'll try only reviewing this based on how I felt about the film. OK Like all Bond films it opens up with a fast paced action scene with Bond chasing who could only be a bad guy and then quickly devolves into James Bond feeling like he's been betrayed by the Espionage MI6 company he works for. Typical plot points for spy films. However I noticed that they were putting a more realistic side to 007 that they have never really done before. Now I can admit I have never seen every single James Bond film ever but I did grow up watching most if not all the Sean Connery era Bond and some of the Roger Moore and I believe I have seen all the Pierce Brosnan along with all of Daniel Craig. So I hope I can give an informed review. Now to all the purist I know most of you feel that Sean Connery will always and forever be James Bond. I can agree that Sean Connery was the best Bond so far but the Bond films were not the best.Skyfall is probably in my honest opinion one of the best 007 film I have seen. I say this because it's a more realistic James Bond. I noticed one reviewer listing either what he thought was plot holes or something he didn't like. One I believed he named was something to do with Bond running to catch up with the villain Silva (Javier Bardem) instead of stopping a police officer or getting a vehicle to catch up. It's such minor scene and yet they don't really show how Bond catches up so off screen Bond really could have stolen a car they just don't explain how it happens because it's showing M at a the hearing. Yet he mentions the older Bond films especially the Roger Moore Bond films and how they're so much more realistic. Seriously!? Like how a car can flip over and ski upside down while shooting its guns and killing the cannon fodder enemies? Or better yet the Buzz Saw in a yo-yo like device? Should I keep going the Laser Watch? The Invisible Aston Martin? How about the Hat that could cut your head off. What about the main villain telling 007 his whole plan of taking over the world then putting him in a ridiculous death trap and then walking out leaving the trap to kill Bond without actually verifying him actually dying. Instead of pumping 2 bullets into Bond's head? That to me is unrealistic and thank god the new James Bond doesn't follow these plot devices anymore. They even make a joke about it in Skyfall.'No Mr. Bond I expect you to die!' Now the movie was longer than it should have been and I prefer Casino Royale's action to Skyfall. And I absolutely hated Quantum of Solace. So I'm not biased towards Daniel Craig and his Bond films I just think that they added a more realistic side to Bond films than any other film so far. Most Bond films always made James Bond as a super suave good looking spy who never let anything compromise his missions not emotion, losing a friend, always had the right gadget in the most dire of situations. It didn't matter if he was shot, injured, drunk, or completely tied up with no escape he would save the day and then have time to bang the hot chick who just met him 30 seconds ago. He was an unemotional unstoppable killing sex cyborg with a genius level intellect who never makes any mistakes. Which is why I like Skyfall because he isn't portrayed this way. He is still an incredibly suave extremely efficient killer, MI6 Agent, and generally will stop at nothing to complete the mission, but in Skyfall he's having to deal with feeling betrayed and being injured and loss. Also dealing with the fact that he's not a young buck anymore and it might be time for him to leave MI6 for the younger guys. The director (Sam Mendes) put in the human element. That James Bond is not perfect and bad things can happen.Now it was a little slower than a lot of Bond films but for me that doesn't detract from the overall movie. I don't need explosions every 10 seconds or I'm falling asleep or start watching another movie in my head. I just think that overall it was one of the better Bond films. Casino Royale is my favorite still but Skyfall is definitely worthy of the title. So for other Bond fans who like the Daniel Craig films I hope you enjoy it. Don't take my word or anyone else watch it yourself and make up your own mind.",8,1,6,12 January 2013
