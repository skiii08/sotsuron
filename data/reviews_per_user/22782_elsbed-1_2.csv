The Blair Witch Project," Left me physically ill, but not scared witless
","My husband and I waited a few weeks for the 'hoopla' to die down before seeing this. Most everyone I had spoken to said it was quite good. I must admit it was very freakish at times, enough to cause hair to stand on end (which doesn't happen too often to me). But it was only so long before the jerky filming made me sick to my stomach. We left the theater feeling dazed, disoriented and physically sick, not from terror but from motion sickness. From total darkness to a sudden bright light, then a sideways shot and running...I literally don't know how much longer I could have sat there. The film was fairly good, interesting concept; I felt connected to the characters. But it didn't leave me frightened to death as I was led to believe it would. Creeped out, yes. (I believe one really would have to view it in a darkened theater to get the motion sickness effect, when one's eyes are forced to focus solely on the screen). At the end of the film, people were asking, 'Is that it?', disgusted moans were heard; there seemed to be an overall disappointment. Yes, it was fairly good, and different; No, it was not stellar. My only hope is that we aren't subjected to a tidal wave of copycat 'Blair Witch' films, ready to exploit this 'new concept'--once was enough.",Null,1,1,6 September 1999
The Shining," Overrated and a bore
","I've tried, really tried several times to sit down and watch this movie and find  its redeeming qualities...what am I missing? Most people I know who've seen it rate it as one of the scariest movies of all time. I'm sorry, but I don't agree. It has its creepy moments. Jack Nicholson does a fair job of becoming increasingly deranged, there is some tension there, but scary? I don't know. Shelly Duvall is horrid, I just keep visualizing her as Olive Oyl, and it doesn't work. She is whiny and ineffectual; it is hard for me to empathize with her, and I find the little boy more and more irritating as the movie progresses. But the primary feeling I get is not fright, but utter boredom. Everything moves so slowly, so languidly that I find it hard to be interested, let alone frightened. I am not a great Kubrick fan, with maybe the exception being 'Clockwork Orange'...so I am sure those who like his style might find it appealing. To each his own...",Null,0,2,15 November 1999
