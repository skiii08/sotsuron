Marie Antoinette," What a waste.... Only eye candy (and limited at that)
","Such a waste. The whole of the Ch√¢teau of Versailles as a backdrop for this film. Great period costumes. And then...........slow, boring, inappropriate music trying to place MA in the 21st century. It starts off well showing the difficulties of 18th Century life in the court of Versailles, but then tries to Americanize the experience of the young MA as though living in Hollywood in the Paris Hilton age. Total disgust. The plot slows down to show the ennui of the palace life and probably distorts it as well. The few accurate historic lines (recorded and repeated often in French history classes) just barely rectify the situation. KD is of course beautiful and maybe appropriate for the role but the script and music and length lose everything!",1,8,13,17 September 2007
Kelly's Heroes," enjoyable from start to finish
","a great military comedy.  refreshing and very well acted by all.  the story is obvious but the approach could benefit some newer movies.  very limited 'special effects' keep the action on the acting and rewards the viewers with great actors: Savalas, Eastwood, Sutherland, and O'Connor shine.",10,7,10,10 November 2003
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," must see at least twice
","the story is too complex for a single viewing.   a classic comedy with quirky characters.  it takes time to appreciate all the nuances in the movie about life and the human struggle to succeed.the hero and his followers are on the brink of success often, only to be jerked back to ground zero and have to start again.abounds in philosophy and wisdom...like Homer intended.very high quality.",10,0,0,26 July 2001
