Raiders of the Lost Ark," Extremely overrated movie
","I have finally seen Raiders of the Lost Ark, after having seen the last 2 parts of the trilogy some years ago.  I was quite disappointed overall.  The opening was entertaining and strong, but then the movie fell into a horribly boring sequence.  It picks up again during the truck chase sequence, before leaving us with a ridiculously supernatural ending.  That was a let-down for a movie where everything else was reasonably realistic.Another point I wanted to mention is I can't see how this movie got a PG-13 rating.  The amount of gratuitous violence is almost overwhelming.  The body count racked up by the end of the movie is probably greater than all of the Friday the 13th movies put together.  Granted, the amount of violence is equal to many action movies out today, but they don't have PG-13 ratings. The camera lingers on mutilated faces, gallons of blood are thrown around, and countless numbers of faceless Arabs and Nazis are killed or injured. Not exactly family material.The few exciting action sequences here save this movie from being a total wreck, but I can't seen any justification for this movie's current position in the top 20 movies of all time.  Maybe the sentimental factor is the reason.",6,12,25,1 January 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Some Complaints
","I was not thoroughly impressed with Pirates of the Caribbean, as I had heard several glowing word-of-mouth reviews.  I have to admit that Johnny Depp's performance was quite hilarious and was the best thing about this movie.  One complaint is that the movie is way too long.  They could have easily chopped 30-45 minutes from this film without sacrificing anything. Another complaint is the level of violence.  I am a horror fan, and certainly am not against violence in the movies. However, the impression this movie gives prior to watching is that it is a Disney-esque film.  I think the PG rating is too leniant and the given the stabbings, shootings, and blood that abound in this film, they should have raised it. 6/10",6,0,1,12 April 2004
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," Not Bad
",Decent romantic comedy.  I've seen both better and worse. The scene at the Diamond party gets incredibly complex when you try to get your head around who knows what and who's trying to exploit who.  Kate Hudson does a pretty good job in this.,6,0,0,5 September 2003
10 Things I Hate About You," Can't Find 10 things to hate about this movie!
","Around the time the 10 Things came out, we we being flooded with teen movies, some good, some trash.  We were inundated with American Pie, Cruel Intentions, Never been kissed, and a tonne of Freddy Prinze stuff. 10 Things clearly emerges as the best of this lot, head-and-shoulders above the rest.  The story is well-written and the acting is good. I loved the scene where Bianca was getting told-off in the car after the party.  The scene where Heath Ledger is singing 'Can't take my eyes off you' to Julia Stiles in the stadium was also hilarious.  An above-average teen movie with some depth.  8/10.",8,0,0,27 April 2004
