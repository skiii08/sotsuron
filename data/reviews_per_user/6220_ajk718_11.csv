The Benchwarmers," it was okay.
","this movie was okay. some parts were funny, but i wouldn't go as far as saying that it was absolutely hilarious though. it was from happy madison productions and i am a big fan of adam sandler so i decided to give it a shot even though i was not too enthusiastic in doing so. i feel that some the characters saved the film though. for example, Howie (Nick Swardson) was somewhat funny, but the whole eating sun lotion thing was very gross and the sun is a monster thing was ridiculous. carlos (the drunk pitcher) was also pretty funny and was definitely one of the more memorable characters in this film. carlos's fake birth certificate was the funniest part regarding him. the reward for the most interesting character, however, had to go to the number 7 robot! when comparing this movie to others from happy madison productions, it definitely missed the mark on the comedy factor and its humor was more gross than hilarious although the flying baseball bats from spade's character and his attempt to duct tape his hands to bat so it wouldn't happen again was pretty funny but again not hilarious and was somewhat corny and overdone. was it worth the $15.50 i paid for two tickets? absolutely not!! i went to see the movie because i wanted to take my friend out for his 21st birthday, but he also came out with the 'eh it was okay' reaction' as well. my advice (if you haven't seen it yet: wait until it comes out on DVD and rent it if you want to see it and you can wait a few months. it is not worthy enough to pay for a theater ticket, so save your money!!!!!",5,1,3,14 April 2006
Finding Nemo," the BEST animated work by pixar as of yet!!!!
","this animated movie is a masterpiece and i have yet to find one person to say otherwise. i saw this movie twice: the first time was when it was one of the on flight movies on my virgin Atlantic flight to europe and then i saw again recently on the Disney channel. unfortunately, i don't have the DVD yet but as soon as i get the chance, i'm buying it.marlin, a clown fish, loses his entire family to an attack by a predator. sadly, this includes a couple of hundred unhatched eggs. only one survives, which he names nemo. as a result to this incident, marlin starts to have a fear for the ocean and on his first day of school, nemo goes off alone and his caught by some fishermen and ends up in a fish tank in a dentist's office in sydney, Australia. despite his fear, marlin travels the ocean in search for his son. throughout his journey, he meets several unusual creatures and is confronted by many obstacles. close to the beginning, he meets with three sharks who want to quit eating fish and have the motto 'fish are friends not food.' he also meets another absent-minded fish named dory (voice of the always funny ellen degeneres). dory accompanies marlin throughout his entire journey creating a hilarious pair and many laughs. out of the many animated works by pixar this one is definitely the one to watch!",10,0,2,8 May 2006
"Monsters, Inc."," pixar has done it again!
","another animated masterpiece by pixar! i actually saw this movie recently when it was shown on the Disney channel, but this was the only time i saw it. unfortunately, i didn't get to see it when it was out in theaters. pixar has made several excellent animated films and monsters inc is surely not an exception. monster inc. is set in the ever famous scream factory where monsters access doors that lead into the rooms of little children in order to scare them while they are sleeping. the screams that result from these children is the energy that makes light bulbs glow and cars drive in the world in which the monster's live. however, trouble and madness ensues when Sulley, the number one frightener, accidentally lets a human child into the monster world. ironically, the monsters are extremely terrified of these kids that they scare routinely because of the belief that all of them are poisonous and carry loads of diseases. However, Sulley and his fellow monster friend, Mike, discover that Boo (the name which they had given to the child) is really very harmless. throughout the movie, sulley and mike attempt to keep boo hidden until tehy can get her back into her door and asleep in her room. however, this is not as easy as they might think!",10,0,1,8 May 2006
American Pie," leader of all teenage sex comedies
","'American Pie' is a teenage sex comedy that follows the plight of four high school seniors (Jim, Kevin, Finch, and Oz) who make a pact to lose their virginity by the time they graduate from high school and of course, their goal ends up being prom night.The most unlucky of the four is Jim even though Finch ends up having a pretty embarrassing experience in the girl's bathroom. Jim has a father that won't stop giving him advice regarding sex and shows him pornographic magazines and a mother who freaks out when he is caught watching 'illegal channels'. This character is also caught in several compromising situations from masturbating while watching scrambled porn on TV to being caught by his father having sex with an apple pie. The worst of which is blowing it when he has the chance of having sex with a hot foreign exchange student, which is something that the entire high school sees on the internet. Although Jim ends up losing his virginity on prom night, it ends up being with a band camp geek, who ends up using him. The funny thing is that Jim doesn't seem to mind at all. Overall, American Pie is a hilarious movie and may very well be the best of all teenage sex comedies. It definitely sets an example for those that precede it.",8,2,4,22 September 2006
School of Rock," best movie starring jack black i've seen!
","personally, i cannot stand jack black, but surprisingly, i didn't think school of rock was that bad. i couldn't sleep one night and decided to see what movies were on some of the cable movie channels, and this was the only movie showing that looked somewhat interesting. i happened to tune in close to the beginning of the movie so i decided to keep watching.the movie begins when dewey finn (jack black) has been fired from his band causing him to be out of a job and unable to pay for rent or his bills. However, ned schneebly (played by Mike White who also wrote the script, dewey's roommate who works as a substitute teacher. fortunately for dewey, while ned is out, the principal from an expensive private school needs ned to substitute for a teacher that is out. being out of a job, dewey pretends he is ned and goes to work at the school. lucky for dewey, he finds that the children in his class have a musical talent. this gives him a clever idea. he decides to create a band out of these talented students and enter into a 'battle of bands' competition in order to make money. in other words, he is using these children for his own personal needs. while carrying out with this selfish plan to make money, dewey, without knowing it, ends up showing these non-believing and reluctant children that they have some sort of musical talent. everyday dewey forces the students in this fourth grade class to practice letting them believe that they are really doing a major school project that should be kept secret from their parents, the school administration, and the other school children. meanwhile, black's character also befriends a female member of the school staff. overall, this movie is somewhat fun to watch and actually very funny. i enjoyed this movie enough to make go out and by the DVD despite my feelings of jack black.",8,0,0,8 May 2006
The Illusionist," not a bad movie, really....
","to be honest, i only picked up this DVD at my local public library because i found out jessica biel was in it. if it was not for her, i probably would not have given the film a second look. i always felt that biel was one of the hottest stars in Hollywood right now and always looked forward to more work from her.with that said, i was pleasantly surprised that this film was not all that bad (or at least as bad as i have heard other people say) and my friend grew quite fond of the film as well. the beginning was quite slow in the introduction when we meet the younger versions of edward norton's and jessica biel's characters but eventually picks up as they get older. the plot is i interesting enough to keep you watching and i felt that the acting was pretty good.being that i picked up this film just for jessica biel, i was quite upset because of her early death in the film, but with this film being called 'the illusionist,' you don't really believe anything you see in this film at first which makes the plot somewhat confused. the ending may be a twist if you think if it that way. at the end, the inspector 'finds' out what really happened to jessica biel's character, but the way the final scene is portrayed you don't really know if this is the truth or if this is the way the inspector himself is portraying it. as the audience, you never really find out the truth and it is really left to the imagination. therefore, i decided to watch the final scene with the director's audio commentary on and he gave information you probably already know, but he gave a pretty interesting description of the movie, which i will paraphrase here because i forgot the actual quote. he stated that the whole film is about the audience's perception of things so therefore the outcome of the film is different to everyone that watches it which makes the plot so much more interesting....this is definitely a film with a very involved and deep plot and it definitely deserves a second viewing in order to understand everything...",8,0,0,30 April 2007
Million Dollar Baby," amazing film!!!
","first of all, i have to say that generally i am not the biggest fan of boxing movies, but this one was different and i was pleasantly surprised by how deep the film actually was...it was also, believe or not, my first Clint Eastwood film (now, i may have seen parts of other in the past, i probably just didn't know it was his work) but anyway, on to my review....at the beginning of the film, we meet Eastwood's character, Frankie Dunn, an experienced but hardened boxing trainer who has trained numerous successful male boxers...then enter Hillary swank playing the part of Maggie Fitzgerald, a financially challenged thirty something waitress with a 'trailer trash' (for lack of a better word) family. she turns to boxing to make difference in her life and help undeserving family, who do not react happily have she offers them a house in the film...however, this dream does not come easy for Maggie as the only person should wants to train her is Frankie....who doesn't train girls....however, Frankie's only friend (aside from a priest that we meet a few times in the film) is his old partner Eddie 'scrap-iron' dupris. who lives is and watches over Frankie's gym. sees talent from this frustrated female boxer...and he is eventually convinced to train her after a long period of nagging him...Maggie enters Frankie's life just in time as the viewer find out about the strained relationship with his daughter who he continuously writes to but his letters are always returned to him...therefore, Frankie gets emotionally involved with his new trainee and practically adopts her and treats her as he would treat is own daughter...this comes to Maggie's advantage since Maggie's father has left the family (or so the viewer would assume as we do not see him on screen at all throughout the film)...overall, the film is excellently done and this is definitely a surprise since from watching the special features on the DVD, one would find out that Eastwood (who has done wonderful work in both directing and acting in this film) never requested a second draft from the scriptwriter and worked right from the very first draft which amazed me since the storyline and plot was perfectly constructed...Hillary swank is also an excellent actress and i am looking forward to more work from this extremely talented woman....10 stars out of 10 is my rating!!!!!",10,3,6,24 April 2007
8 Mile," eminem does not belong in movies!
","i consider myself to be a big fan of eminem, but of his music only. i don't think he makes a very actor. the movie was okay for an actor who is just starting out. despite the fact that the film is mostly fiction, it did give his fans a good insight on how much he had to go through in order get to where he is today in the industry. however, i was quite disappointed by the ending of the movie. i thought they were going to show eminem's character on stage in a concert after he won the battle or at least show that he completed the album he working on in the movie. i feel that it should have shown more of his successes rather than just winning the rap battle.",8,0,0,8 May 2006
A Bug's Life," genius!
","bug's life is just genius! i actually cannot decide which one is better: finding nemo or bug's life. this was definitely the best animated film of its time. i think this movie came out during the summer of 1998 so it was the summer right before i started seventh grade. i saw it twice in the theaters. once with my cousins and then with a group of friends. then i saw about a dozen times on he Disney channel. like i wrote in my finding nemo review, it was extremely hard to find someone to admit that they didn't like this movie. my favorite character was the German speaking caterpillar. this entire movie was just genius! i can't say it enough times!!!! if you haven't seem this movie yet, you should definitely go rent or buy the DVD or wait until the Disney channel shows it again, which i doubt they will since it has been so long ago.",10,0,1,8 May 2006
Wedding Crashers," the funniest movie of 2005!
","wedding crashers is by far one of the most hilarious comedies i have seen in the year 2005!!! owen Wilson and vince vaugn play two 30-something divorce mediators and friends John Beckwith and Jeremy Grey who share the hobby of crashing weddings in order to pick up women for a one night stand. however, when they attend a wedding of the daughter of the secretary of the treasury, one of them gets into trouble (the girl wants a committed relationships) while the other feels like he has met his true love, but his true love already has a boyfriend.the reason why this movie is so funny is the fact that Wilson and vaugn work so well together on screen.",10,1,4,8 May 2006
Shark Tale," good effort but somewhat disappointing!
","with big and well-known names such as will smith, Robert De Nero, Renee zellwegger, Angelina Jolie, Ziggy Marley, and Katie couric involved in this animated film, i felt that this movie was going to at least come close to finding nemo, a masterpiece that is and always will be the leader of the 'under-the-sea' type animation. shark tale was somewhat disappointing and i did not notice anything hilariously funny about it. in this film, a fish (voice of will smith that wants to make a name for himself in society believing that he is a loser.. coincidentally, while trying to escape a shark, he ends up 'killing' it (it was really just an accident). however, the other fish believe that he actually killed the shark and he receives fame and glory as the 'shark slayer.' anxious for the chance to be somebody, this fish plays along and uses it to his advantage. the most ridiculous part is the fact that these sharks are actually afraid of this puny fish. however, this is nothing compared to will smith's role at the end of this moving in mending the relationship between a father shark and his son who chose a vegetarian lifestyle instead of being like the other sharks. the only 'funny' parts in this movie involve the shrimp who appear a few times (at least in think they are shrimp). after seeing finding nemo, this movie was definitely a disappointment.",8,7,9,8 May 2006
