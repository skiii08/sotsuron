Deja Vu," The Best Time-Travel Film EVER ! ! ! ! ! !
","Denzel Washington and director Tony Scott ( both collaborators on the hits, 'Man on Fire' and 'Crimson Tide' ) team up for the third time on this brilliant film that mixes philosophy, dram and action along with brain-twisting physics. The plot: A New Orleans ferry is destroyed by a terrorist bomb set by an mysterious figure. Detectives trying to solve the shocking devastation are introduced to a special crime solving machine used to reenact murders and other situations after they have occurred. It turns out that one murdered woman, who's been missing, might be the key to solving the entire crime. Can this entire puzzle be cracked? Can they go back in time before the entire scenario even occurred and change all of this from even happening?Review: Everything in this film is excellent. The actors ( Washington, Val Kilmer, Adam Goldberg, Bruce Greenwood and James Caviezel ) are all in top form and fans of them will be pleased; the special effects are used to tell the story instead of being just 'gratuitous eye candy;' Terrio Rossio ( writer of The Mask of Zorro, Shrek, Pirates of the Caribbean, and other similar Dreamworks/Disney/Bruckheimer fare) and Bill Marsili's script is full of imagination and ideas even worth discussing after the film; Tony Scott works beautifully with what content he hes; while I'm not a huge fan, I will think Jerry Bruckheimer for financing this thrilling adventure; and, last of all, the musical score by Harry Gregson-Williams is a blast! This guy has written electronic/instrumental musical scores for both Tony and Ridley Scott's films, as well as animated ones and video-games, and has never disappointed his audiences. This might be more of a 8/10, but seeming how I throughly enjoyed every minute and want to own this DVD so bad, I'm going to rate it the total amount! See now !",10,3,6,28 October 2007
Amistad," One of Spielberg's well-received films that's not as popular.
","Once again, Steven Spielberg has crafted his magic on giving the world another historical/epic masterpiece. It is a chronicle on how the African-American slaves of a Spanish trading ship fought for their freedom and had their fate be determined in court.Djimou Hounsou is beyond excellent in one of his first big roles and has always stolen the show as he does here. The supporting cast also includes Morgan Freeman, Matthew McConaughey and Anthony Hopkins as well as several actors that I have seen in various films, but don't necessarily know their names by heart. ANyway, the performances are all good, the scenery/costumes/etc. are reminiscent of the time period and the accuracy is good as well where it's interesting enough to be entertaining, but not too 'Hollywood-ish.' And while it's rated R, I would still recommend that parents and school districts show this in history classes when the kids are at a mature level so they can learn their past more visually and make the class more fun as well. Hey, they show 'Glory' at school, why not 'Amistad' ?",10,0,2,28 October 2007
Blade," Comic Book Movie with Stylish Martial Arts.
","Face it, I've never liked vampire and/or horror movies, but then I rented this film and, man, was I in for a treat! This film isn't so much a Horror film, but merely a action movie w/ Vampire lore and anti-hero looking for revenge. Wesley Snipes has had a couple of good and bad roles either as a supporting or leading character, but he is merely a 'like-hm-or-hate-him' sort of person here. He is truly skilled in a type of kung-fu and he was obviously having a lot of fun kicking everyone's butt. The supporting actors ( Kris Kristofferson, N'Bushe Wright, Udo Kier, Stephen Dorff, Sanaa Lathan ) help explain our hero's characteristics/abilities and the world that they all live in. There are a couple of cons: plot holes, gratuitous profanity, and a techno/electronic music score that only rival the above pros. And if, you, the viewer, are not satisfied, then at least acknowledge that this film helped inspire Action/SciFi movies (THE MATRIX) and satisfy Marvel Comic Productions enough to bring more of their creations to the screen (X-MEN, SPIDER-MAN).Recommende for those interested in these type of movies.",8,0,2,12 August 2007
Crash," One of the best written, well-acted & directed films crafted!
","While the Academy Award-show was being prejudiced against 'Brokeback Mountain' due to it's homosexual themes and controversial nature, this film honestly isn't that different then the other so the 'Best Picture' award should have done to something else that was good, but not like the other two.Anyway, this is writer/producer Paul Haggis's ( Casino Royale(2006); recent Clint Eastwood films) first theatrical film that he directed and his co-written screenplay is one of the most complex, yet extremely intriguing concepts ever put on film. The movie basically deals with racism, the people in L.A. who experience it and, ironically, are all somewhat related to each other. It wisely gives each race an decent, but equal amount of screen time and no one ever feels left out of this, thus anyone can watch it and get something out of it and not be restricted by it's message and/or the marketing audience.About all the races are looked at: the Hispanics, the Asians, the Blacks, even the Persians! The music is gorgeously beautiful and fits the tone perfectly. The movie is sad, but not too depressing to where it will make the viewer want to turn it off.The actors consist of currently popular screen-names ( like Don Cheadle and Sandra Bullock), upcoming stars who almost steal the show ( Michael Pena, Ryan Phillipe, Jennifer Esposito, Thandie Newton and Terrence Dashon Howard ), character actors who are always recognized by their familiar faces and roles ( Larentz Tate and William Fichtner ) as well as other 'well- known's' making brief appearances that aren't really cameos ( Keith David and Brendan Frasier ).This is one of the best 'all-star' cast, controversial and thought-provoking films ever produced! A lot of the other films of 2004 are just downright silly when compared to the greatness that is this film!",10,1,4,9 November 2007
Blade II," Pretty good sequel, but not for everyone.
","This movie manages to live up to the under-rated original, but just like the 1999 remake of THE MUMMY, if you didn't 'dig' the first one, then you won't find anything different about the follow-up. Wesley Snipes does less talking and more fighting as he faces more enemies and meets possible allies ( some of them are annoying). Kris Kristofferson returns as well and Ron Perlman joins the gang, but has plans of his own. The film will not scare anyone, but it will pack a punch for Action/Adventure fans as there are numerous stunts and enough blood to satisfy the 'gore' fan. Sometime the stunts don't work because they rely too much on CGI (Realistic animation done w/ computers).There also could had been better character development and less flaws, but that wasn't the film's biggest goal. People who do not like ultra-violent movies or are 'squemish' have better stay clear because once this film starts, it never let's up. Recommended for fans of the first film and those seeking a type of 'action-sequences- galore!' movie.",8,0,1,12 August 2007
The Godfather: Part II," One of the few sequels thats just as good as the last!
","This movie succeeds in both quality and follow-up. The first one is, no doubt, a masterpiece that had literally no flaws, with the exception of being very one, but a lot of older films are like that so might as well get over it. This sequel is a couple of years after the original where young Michael Corleone just took over his late father's crime organization and, while, progressing, is also having some personal problems that interfere with his business. He has nearly been killed by a traitor within his organization, his wife is tired of living this way and ends up wanting a divorce, his sister wants to move back in, he is trying to take over a Las Vegas casino forcefully, etc. While some people might think this is all pointless killings and depressing tragedies, it's really all about Michael and his actions which cause consequences around him. He had originally sworn not to be part of his father's illegal business and he ended up being like his dad anyway. What's also cool about this film is it also explains his late father's background, which is explained through flashbacks. It consists of Vito coming to America, adopting henchmen and stopping another Don from ruining his and his town's life. It's once again full of a full-star cast, excellent cinematography and scenery, courtroom drama, top-notch acting and good writing/directing.",10,0,1,28 October 2007
The Matrix Revolutions," Better then part 2 and should get cut some slack !
","Is this another worthy sequel ? Yes.Is it liked and hated by fans ? Yes.It it better then other Part 3's like Blade: Trinity and PotC: World's End ? Heck Yes.Is it both liked and hated by fans ? Yes.Should it be re-watched and appreciated ? Yes. Yes. Yes.This film is actually pretty good and has just as many Action sequences as the first two. The Wachowski Brothers once again don't bother going into the basics due to the fact that there is already a ton of conflicts between all our protagonists and antagonists that are both old and new ( there even the cool addition of The Trainman ! ). The first couple of minutes are focused with the disappointing 'cliffhanger' that happened in Part 2 and is weird, but necessary for closure and, plus, it involves our main protagonists. Meanwhile, the other characters that don't have as much closure, but are also a huge 1/3 of the plot have finished debating from last movie and are literally preparing for 'War and Freedom.' The antagonists ( bad guys ) are ready to crush them, but also interested in the other conflict that involves our main hero, from the last two films, Neo. The film is mainly focused on his quest to end the war while providing info. on all the other sub-plots. The film generally does what both the other two big epics 'Star Wars' and Lord of the Rings' do, they show constantly what everyone is doing on both sides 'back-and-forth.' The last two films are no stranger to this story-telling technique, but it's a lot more noticeable here because it's constantly intense then the last two films. As for the movie's final conflict, which involves Neo and Smith finally meeting 'face-to-face,' it is simply one of the best fights between both the good and bad guy that I have ever seen ! Why no one thinks that is crazy because this is the most epic point in the entire series, which is to finally determine the faith of the movie's universe and characters. The questions from last film are not given enough thought nor are they explained clearly, but no one should blame this film because they never had real significance to the overall film anyway and, plus, Part 2 is guilty for even conjuring the ideas in the first place. I personally believe that the Wachowski Brothers just wanted to get their audience thinking while they were in awe at the entire massive-scale battles and impressive visual imagery expressed in all films combined. As for the ending, I thought it was pretty tight, but everyone just criticized the film just for that one thing and I betcha they were enjoying the film just up until that pint, but yet did not understand the significant to the Wachowski's wisdom and 'tongue-in cheek' humor. What the brothers were conjuring up was an unpredictable ending and they succeeded successfully because, in interviews, they have stated how tired they are of the 'same old ending,' so they decided to do something out the usual, which was what was expressed in this film. Even if you fans have been spoiled about the particular ending, don't cheat yourself like all the other fans are, see this film and appreciate it like the previous two unless you're not a fan of this series/genre to begin with, which I would then scold you for not being 'open-minded' enough. See Now !",8,2,4,20 October 2007
The Alamo," Will only appeal to history buffs, but will bore average viewers.
","I tried, I really did try to enjoy this historical war film and I wasn't expecting a continuously violent/brutal saga like a lot of other films in the genre have fallen into, but me and my dad were just glad we had watched it on TNT cable as opposed to the theater motive.I was just expecting a re-enactment of the historical legends w/ a couple of battle scenes and historical license, but the entire film just dragged on and on to where you didn't really care when the actual battle took place. Plus, all the characters aren't really given much equal screen time so it's also disappointing because the viewer then can't connect at all with any of them. And despite enjoying all the actors, whenever they gave a speech, it never really had any effect on me at all which is what these films are supposed to do which is wrap you into their conflict or at least 'see the light.' But again. . . . Noooooo!And while I don't hate the director ( who also directed Dennis Quaid in 'The Rookie' ), I kinda wished he could've found a better project to film instead of this. I once heard Ron Howard planned on directing, but he was going to make it a brutal, dark R-rated film and while I enjoyed his recent 'The Missing,' I wish he could take a somewhat lighter/tame tone as opposed to making it another violent tear-fest. I know these films are tender subjects, but the filmmakers can chose whether they want another depressing film on their hands so there.Watch it on T.V. when it's on, but you'll most likely get bored with it due to the enormous commercials we've been having lately.",1,5,17,3 November 2007
Van Helsing," I love the Mummy movies, but this is an unwelcome sight for the eyes!
","Synopsis: A stylized update on Universal Horror/Fantasy franchises w/ bad acting, bad special effects and an insult to any serious movie-goer who just wants to have some fun. That basically sums up this joke of a movie. Director Stephen Sommers has created mayhem rather then a popcorn movie experience. It's not even good fun for people into movies that feature the Wolfman, Frankenstein, vampires and/or Dragula, who here is lamer then the version portrayed in 'Blade: Trinity' if that clarifies things anymore then they need to be clarified. Hugh Jackman ( the awesome X-MEN movie franchise) and Kate Beckinsale ( star of a similar dumb series of films known as 'Underworld' and the awful 'Pearl Harbor') seem to be wondering what the heck the're doing firing a crossbow prop at a CGI flying vampire bride and don't have anywhere else to go, but what's handed to them. A huge disappointment from Universal Pictures and a wasted opportunity all the same.",1,1,4,9 September 2007
Pearl Harbor," No words can describe this catastrophe.
","Michael Bay will most likely never win an Oscar for his movie-making career, which consists of awesome films like 'THE ROCK,' BAD BOYS I & II, TransFormers and THE ISLAND and, as a executive producer, helped finance the 'too-awful-for-words'TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE and THE HITCHER remakes. He's known for hating the critics, getting praise from Steven Spielberg himself and making 'popcorn' movies. To explain the trend, he merely did 'Okay' with Armageddon and then went downhill on this dumb excuse to sit through THREE HOURS OF FILM!!!! 3 hours!!! That's just enough to make everyone walk out of the theater unless it's an entertaining movie that can only tell that much in that time period.Bay has enlisted the help of Bruckheimer, who also is good at creating too many unnecessary sequels like BEVERLY HILLS COP II and PotC: At World's End, and BRAVEHEART screenwriter Randall Wallace to give us this mess of a film. I don''t even recommend it for the actual attack scene because it's so fake-looking with all the cheap computer graphics. I can't even get into the experience because I don't ever feel like the characters are in danger nor do I care if they die or live. This movie should be deleted from Bay's record of films( some of you would even suggest he not make movies anymore) and Bruckheimer should retire from this career. Wallace should go back to college and re-read his history or watch Discovery Channel. Or maybe, YOU, the viewer, can just not watch this movie. End of Discussion!",1,2,3,30 August 2007
Saw," It's been done before and way better too!
","Sure, there have been several films like this before where some detectives are investigating serial killer's minds and the murders that follow. There was first, 'Silence of the Lambs,' then there was 'Se7en,' then 'Kiss the Girls,' and the French series of 'Crimson Rivers' films. But here we have a bit more horror elements borrowed from over-rated films that weren't good to begin with like 'Texas Chainsaw' and 'Mindhunters.' But while that might be original, the film can not escape seclusion from being just 'plain-out loud stupid' and while I know this genre is meant to scare or thrill people, I couldn't enjoy the film in a 'popcorn' sort of way.Also, the actors are wasted here big time! Cary Elwes is trapped with another guy and his connection with this entire case is explained thru flashbacks, but he never really stands out, he just kinda looks frantic, but bland at the same time; Danny Glover ( Lethal Weapon series, Shooter) and Ken Leung ( Rush Hour, X3, Spy Game, Inside Man) have nothing really to do with their detective characters who just stand around on monitors just looking at what the killer is going to do next; Dina Meyer ( Starship Troopers, the awful 'Saw' sequels) only says dialog that what the viewer is already thinking, but doesn't move the plot forward at all with what she's given; Monica Potter has nothing really to do as the wife of Elwe's character; and the only real standout is Tobin Bell as the serial character who is playing mind-games with everyone and would return as the character in the sequels to cause more mayhem and carnage!And last of all, the ending is so predictable and lame, it made me want to cringe! It was pretty darn obvious that Jigsaw was the 'supposedly dead' guy on the floor, who then locks up Cary Elwes in the cell forever. Elwes starts to scream, 'NOOOOOO!' Cut to end credits and there is no music, but there is a rhythm of screaming agonies. This leads me to say that the people who created this flick should go to jail for actually thinking such disturbing thoughts. Seriously, this is so callous even for a horror flick. Plus, who roots for the bad guy to get away anyway?!? That's just plain out wrong!",2,1,2,3 November 2007
The Last Samurai," One of the best Adventure movies and an excellent performance from Cruise.
","Sure, Tom Cruise hasn't always been the most respected person in his actual life, but you have to give him some kudos for his performance here as a Civil War vet caught between two opposing sides at war with each other in 1870 Japan. The movie has basically everything: excellent cinematography, skilled direction by Edward Zwick ( GLORY, COURAGE UNDER FIRE ), skilled supporting actors ( Billy Connelly, Ken Watanobe,etc.) and brutal battle sequences. These all flow very well together and, by the end of the film, you'll be crying a river for it's dark history and characters, that the viewer have grown attached, to that will bleed for others and a cause they all believe in.The violence never feels gratuitous and will fit perfectly in your DVD collection of classics. It is a spectacle for the eyes, an education for the noggin and a pleasing film for fans of other feudal Japan movies like Akira Kurosawa's 'RAN' and 'THE SEVEN SAMURAI.' A must-see !",9,2,5,29 August 2007
Inside Man," Boring and Overrated film. Watch 'CHAOS' instead !
","This was talked about to death by the critics when it honestly isn't that great. Sure, 'CHAOS' and 'INSIDE MAN' are literally the same movie, just with variations in suspense. But I found 'CHAOS' more enjoyable because it was fast paced kinda like the silly film 'Swordfish.' The reason this film is more popular is because this got released in the States and 'Chaos' was aired all around the world at film festivals and foreign theaters, but has yet to find a distributor in the U.K. and U.S.A. It's true that this film makes lots of tributes to classic films like DOG DAY AFTERNOON and other Spike Lee films, but that doesn't mean that it is a pleasant film to watch. Watch it if nothing else is on T.V., but you'll probably get bored with after awhile.",4,1,4,26 August 2007
The Untouchables," Another good Crime Period piece !
","This and 'The Godfather 1 and 2' are both the best crime flicks set during the late '30s-early 40s. Besides the time periods, they both have the best acting, music, action, memorable characters, cinematography, thrills and quality that anyone could possibly want. However, some viewers don't find this as popular as the other due to taking historical events and taking some liberty with them. But de Palma's film is still just as entertaining as Coppola's masterpiece because they have numerous 'pros' and hardly any 'cons.'Robert Di Nero greatfully embodies Al Capone and doesn't make it to where he's just hogging the show; Kevin COstner, an under-rated guy, becomes Elliot Ness no problem; Sean Connery equally shares the screen as Jim Malone; and Andy Garcia and Charles Martin Smith join the party as detectives Geroge Stone and Oscar Wallace. The writing is brilliantly thought out and has all the twists and turns keep the movie rolling; director De Palma ( Mission: Impossible, the over-rated Scarface) keeps things lively by having the brilliant musical score playing and the gun-fights lively; and the court-room scene is one word: awesome.",10,1,3,28 October 2007
The Matrix Reloaded," Decent sequel with a couple of problems.
","Is this movie good ? Yes. Is this movie as good, but not better then it's predecessor ? Yes.Does it have good Action sequences ? Yes. Can it drag and not accomplish as much as it could ? Yes.Does it have a cool ending ? No.This sequel is as good, but not better then the original classic before it and for what small problems it contains, it ends up losing a couple of points.The film doesn't really have a real huge storyline like the first one due to everyone already knowing the main premise and all. The Wachowski Brothers just want to compete with the summer movie market of blockbusters by rushing through all the philosophical discussions and simply just wanting to show constant struggles and please the 'adrenaline junkies' who can't have enough peril in their lives.There are some cool new characters that even steal the show ( The Twins are cool bad guys that should have returned in the third one because they're so awesome ! ); there are troublesome bad guys like The Merovigian, who you just want to die because he's so cunning and slick as a whistle, as well as the return of Agent Smith. There are other characters who appear, but you don't get to know that much about them like Niobe and Ghost ( played respectively by Jada Pinkett Smith & Anthony Wong), but you get to know more about them if you play the video game spin-off 'Enter The Matrix,' but thats a shame because not everyone here plays video games ( I do personally, but still ).Either way if you want a cool, slick flick that doesn't require too much thinking, but yet can still make you ponder & stay interested, then by all means watch this.",8,0,0,20 October 2007
Die Hard," The king of Action films and Hollywood heroes!
","I couldn't say it better myself! This successful film launched both the excellent Bruce Willis and Alan Rickman's film careers as well as succeeded in all entertaining categories/areas of other parts of the film like the tight editing, the suspenseful screenplay, the intense pyro- technics, 'very special' special effects, the stunning aerial views, the top-notch performances, the awesome one-liners, the dry sense of humor and the craftsmanship of under-rated director John McTiernan ( Medicine Man, The 13th Warrior, Predator, Die Hard with a Vengeance ).The film starts out slowly at first by introducing all the main characters ( antagonists, protagonists ) and other random people ( FBI, hostages, terrorists, news reporters ) that all have a place in the the scary conflict. Then before mid-way, the film takes off at random speed and boasts everything a good films needs!And after all these years, it is still a throughly entertaining classic that just never seems to get old. The sequels, while not great, were also worthy/exciting additions to a franchise and gave the world a recognizable hero w/ a killer one-liner reminiscent of a cowboy!",10,2,4,3 November 2007
Shooter," A very entertaining Thriller !
","Sure, we've seen this sort of thing before in books, on T.V. and film. Most of us have seen THE BOURNE IDENTITY trilogy and 'THE FUGITIVE' show/movie by now as well. Going into this movie, you know that Bob Lee Swagger ( played to perfection by Markie Mark) is going to be set up to take the blame for an assassination he did not commit. It's obvious from the preview and DVD cover. But it does not matter because the film is loads of fun and 'simple' summer entertainment. It won't win awards for it's screenplay, actors or pyrotechnics. Maybe for it's sound editing, but that's beside the point. The film's goal is to keep you engaged and Antoine Fuqua ( director of TRAINING DAY and TEARS OF THE SUN ) does a good job ninety-five percent of the time, thus, making the film exciting to watch, even if there isn't any explosions or shoot-outs. Danny Glover is a great bad-guy and fans of his should see this film for his performance, even if they don't love him as a nemesis. Warren Beatty has lost some weight and he is delightful for the older age crowd. Michael Pena ( WORLD TRADE CENTER ) has an excellent supporting role as well. It should excite Adventure/ Thriller fans for two hours and you'll either re-watch it for the action scenes/thrills or for the entertaining aspect of it all. So crank up the stereo and have some fun. P.S. I intend to read the book someday as well.",8,1,4,22 August 2007
Shrek," The best CGI animated film period !
","DreamWork's Animation Department really showed that the talented Pixar division wasn't the only one who knew how to be creative and at the same time be the only one making massive box office hits.This film rocks and even when you get tired of it just give it a couple of months or a year and you will find something new each time.The writers and directors, most of who previously worked for Disney, are so brilliant at taking silly fairy tale concepts and making it to where the entire family can watch without being offended and having something hilarious for kids, teens and adults all at the same time.Last of all, the actors were made for these roles. I can't see Chris Rock playing Donkey as well as Eddie Murphy or seeing Tea Leoni as Cameron Diaz's Fiona. These people were well casted and obviously had a fun time being these animated favorites.If you have not seen it yet, I'm in shock!",10,0,1,4 January 2008
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," The most fascinating failure of all time!
","Seriously, I don't know where to begin on this film which I went to with my grandmother and a sibling. The film has so many pros, but in the end is down-weighed by cons. It's probably worth seeing at least once, but It's not necessarily going to be on your DVD shelf when it's available and that's okay.The Pros: The acting is well delivered from everyone including Cate Blanchett and Clive Owen who are always perfect; the cinematography is gorgeous; the music is very stunning; and that ends up getting 'chewed' down by the Cons: Extremely slow murders; illicit affairs that seem to drag; a not boring, but still long two-and-a-half hours; brief gratuitous nudity; unexciting war battle sequences; a literally non-existent script that seems to be trying to be telling the viewer a message that isn't expressed; all meaningful moments where someone is expressing something has 'next-to-none' meaning; and the excellent music tends to play at inappropriate times like when the characters are saying something vital to the 'nonexistant' plot.And, plus, we viewers have already seen something like this before with the countless Adventure/History/War films out there. But while this film is 'so-so,' it would have had a better place as an above-average T.V. drama, but then again HBO and the BBC have already re-enacted this story countless times so it probably wouldn't have been welcome there either. It's at least better then the 2004 take on 'The Alamo,' but that's not saying very much. So all in all, an extremely visual film with literally no substance. This will most likely only get an Oscar nominee for costume/wardrobe design and that's about it. I doubt it will find a place on cable either ( with the exception of Hallmark ) because it's nothing compared to any other historical drama/mini-series.So see it if you've got time to kill.P.S.: I seriously tried to look for any visual meaning and all I got was when, in one critical scene, Elizabeth is nearly assassinated by a traitor and doesn't die; she then seems to glow for a minute in the bright light as if the director was trying to signify that she is a strong women, but it wasn't elaborated on at all after all so then once again a vaguely-transferred message.",5,10,14,3 November 2007
The Matrix," SciFi meets Kung-Fu Action in a Philosophical film.
","Sure, this film is over-rated, but it's still worth seeing for, well, everything ! The action sequences are still fun to look at, the messages are thrilling and the actors do a superb job ! This film does borrow a couple elements from other hit blockbusters though: it's grim factor and backgrounds are very much like 'Blade Runner;' the 'machine' world is very much like the shock value of 'The Terminator;' there is one scene that requires our main protagonist to take either a red or blue pill ( 'Total Recall'); Don Davis's musical score is like a 'Star Wars' score that is constantly frantic; the lobby shoot-out reminds viewers of how intense the one in 'Heat' was; there is electronic/rock n' roll music playing in the background while people in leathery capes kill other people who are dressed similarly ( 'Blade' ); and, last of all, the entire movie also consists of symbolism to Comic-Books and religion, which is also pretty classic ! Still, the film is undeniably a must-see before anyone here leaves this world ( and hopefully doesn't end up in this one ! ) and deserves it's acclaim.",8,0,2,20 October 2007
Sin City," Pretty good comic book film.
","This is another excellent 'from-page-to-screen' adaptation and it's obviously because author Frank Miller was throughly involved in it. Co-Director Robert Rodriguez ( EL MARIACHI Trilogy ) adds a bit of spice to the action scenes and supervises the soundtrack as well. Quentin Tarantino lends his sick mind as well seeming how he is good pals with Rodriguez and directed similar 4-part crime stories like PULP FICTION. The actors do a good job with the material: Bruce Willis gives a good narration of all the misdeeds and corruption around the metropolis; Clive Owen describes how mad/insane he and the city are; Mickey Rourke is merely in a torture story and the list goes on.The only problem with this film is that not everyone is going to like this type of film: It plays out a lot like a film noir, there is also lots of 'over-the-top' violence to get through as well ( some which will either keep viewers interested or turned-off ). Also, all of the male and female leads are all in some sort of criminal activity with the exception of Willis's Hartigan character. This is mainly going to appeal to the male audience. ******* 7/10 STARS",7,0,1,13 August 2007
V for Vendetta," Excellent comic-book to movie adaptation.
","This is one of the few movies that is actually close to it's graphic novel and that's not all that's good about this film. Hugo Weaving (The LORD OF THE RINGS & MATRIX Trilogies) uses his voice ( but not his face! ) to convey an anti-hero who, in this case, is actually doing the world a favor. John Hurt (1984) is no stranger to this sort of science fiction tale and never let's his acting go over the top. Natalie Portman (LEON THE PROFESSIONAL) shows that she can act and was merely 'drifting' through all the STAR WARS Prequels so she could act in a more serious role here. The set design is perfect, the action sequences aren't the only highlight, politics up for discussion are talked about again & again. Last of all, I personally think this movie is better than it's source material. It's a shame that author Alan Moore didn't agree because this movie is far better than the last couple of adaptations concerning his comics ( CONSTANTINE anyone? ).Recommended for fans of Action, SciFi, and political movies.",8,1,6,12 August 2007
The Godfather," The 'Kingpin' of Gangster films !
",This movie is one of the few exceptions where everything works and everything is excellent. The Acting is very good. The Writing is 'dead-on' brilliant and comes from a best-seller masterpiece. The Cinematography is a very good visual presentation and the Set Design is very true to the '40s time period.The director Coppola makes due with all the right elements despite having a history of not making as many good book-to-movie adaptations like 'The Outsiders' and 'Apocalypse Now.'This is both one of the films movie-lovers should see before they die and simply because it inspired tons of movies in this genre that were nothing compared to this masterpiece.,10,0,2,19 October 2007
