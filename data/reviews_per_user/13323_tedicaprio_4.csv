Black Swan," Captivating!

Gone Girl," Rosamund Pike is Great!
","Rosamund Pike is Gone Girl. Despite the fact that the first quarter of the movie is commanded by Ben Affleck, she steals the show afterwards by being able to 'shape-shift' into many things while being consistent about how to portray a real psychopath in-depth. The movie itself is, according to my boyfriend, mainly about perception, which I agree. At first, I felt I could relate to the character of Amy, then I found myself suspicious about the seeds of psychopath in me, which then I thought it was normal at some degree because I grew significant distance from Amy when she started to really stand out. Overall, I learn that you cannot assume anything without communicating with the object of your assumption. I also learn that you cannot make the slightest flaw in your acting, or else someone else will steal the show, like what happens to Ben Affleck in this movie.",8,2,5,19 January 2015
Joker," Oscar for Phoenix
","Hmmm, initially I wanted to give it a nine for how Phoenix's acting really gripped me throughout the movie. But considering how it turned the movie into a one-man show I must think twice, and here it goes ...... an eight!",8,1,1,8 October 2019
Parasite," Superbly Gripping & Entertaining!
","This movie is about perfection in all aspects of its execution. I did not blink at all the whole time. Jeez, even my first two sentences of review sound like it's an action-packed thriller. But this movie makes itself everything, from satire to horror. Great!",8,1,6,27 August 2019
