Blade Runner 2049," what?
","'I'll need your badge and your gun, and you've got 48 hours to solve this case'
Original.
The impossibly perfect naked young girl falling out of the plastic baggie onto the floor, hard, made me laugh out loud.
I really liked Ryan Gosling, though.
And the babes.
And, Ryan Gosling.
Gosh.
This movie was way better than Paw Patrol,
but not by much.SJW",1,5,8,4 January 2018
The Conjuring," Another un-thrilling thriller!
","PG4, meaning that if you're over four years old, you can't get in, you can only stand in the lobby and eat free popcorn, free as long as you repeatedly press the 'Liked this movie' button. Now don't get me wrong, it has its moments. 500 or so, by my count, each one a mild variation of the same semi-subliminal facial distortion cued to low frequency booming audio. I couldn't help but have major objections to everything in this movie, from its stupid premise to the gradual introduction of its asinine characters, but especially its lame attempt, endless attempts, to be scary. And by God, I would have been scared, too, if I had even a minimal belief and interest in the story and the characters. As it was, I was simply tired of such obvious manipulation, and felt a genuine relief when the credits finally rolled.Sjw",1,3,6,30 August 2014
