First Man," Great low budget indie movie. Oh wait..
","So this is a movie about one of the most significant events in history. And knowing that is pretty much the only thing that makes this movie watchable for over 2 hrs.Acting was decent. Story telling was dull and it could have been kept between 60 to 90 minutes. It definitely could have been told way more interesting way. Sound, music etc. were bad. It was also not a nice watch visually.It sure felt like a low budget movie that ten or so friends shoot for the fun of it.",5,0,0,5 January 2019
