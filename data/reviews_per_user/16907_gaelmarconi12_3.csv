Skyfall," OMG, This made women look bad!
","OK, saw the movie last night. Here's what I noticed..1) Young female agent in the beginning shoots badly..I won't say more. So she doesn't look good.2) M gets a 'talk' from Ralph Fiennes character regarding her job..not good.3) The beautiful dark haired girl..what happens to her..I won't say...not good..4) M at the end!! I mean for God's sake..WHO the hell wrote this?? Barbara Broccolli should be ashamed. The only thumbs up any female got on this film was Adelle's theme song which she wrote and sang. This movie was written in such a way to make all the women fail and slander their abilities. Soemtimes, men (most men) are just plain horrible.",5,6,14,9 December 2012
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Wes Keeps Killing Dogs and Cats in his Movies!
","Wes keeps killing dogs and cats in most of his movies and this evil sh*t needs to stop.It's not funny.Has anyone else noticed this? WES--STOP KILLING ANIMALS IN YOUR MOVIES!!Some day, an animal loving producer(S) will not give you the directing job. I even watched the ENTIRE end credits to Grand Budapest Hotel and there is NOTHING that says 'no animals were harmed'. A cat is killed this time.SHAME ON YOU WES. BE KIND TO ANIMALS IF YOU WANT MORE KUDOS ********** ********(Wes is also sexist as there 1-2 women for every 12 men in his films but that is another issue)",10,2,5,27 July 2014
"Hail, Caesar!"," Don't bother watching this one.
","I rented this movie out and could not wait for it to end. It has to be the worst film coming from the Coen Brothers and I know they can do better.The story just DRAGGGED. The dialog was incoherent especially with Ralph Fiennes and Josh Brolin. The scenes between one another were incoherent and the study group with Clooney was just too boring. This movie did not 'move', it dragged on. I studied film in college and wrote screenplays so I know the story has to 'move' along. A horrible choice for Clooney and Brolin. Frances McDormand had the best part of all, quite funny even though it was a small part. With the Coens, NOTHING beats the Big Lebowski and Fargo. They should have left this one on the shelf collecting dust. Over and out.",1,4,6,18 September 2016
