The Finest Hours," Amazing Special effects and music raises this rescue drama
","The finest hours starts off as a romantic drama, but slowly transcends into a thrilling rescue story. Though the film is in itself predictable, it has some good acting display, top notch production values, amazing Special effects and music. The film is beautifully old-fashioned and though it offers nothing new, this film deserves at least a 7 for its visual splendor and heart.On Feb. 18, 1952, a massive storm splits the SS Pendleton in two, trapping more than 30 sailors inside the tanker's sinking stern. Engineer Ray Sybert bravely takes charge to organize a strategy for his fellow survivors. As word of the disaster reaches the Coast Guard in Chatham, Mass., Chief Warrant Officer Daniel Cluff orders a daring rescue mission. Despite the ferocious weather, coxswain Bernie Webber takes three men on a lifeboat to try and save the crew against seemingly impossible odds.",7,1,5,6 February 2016
The Hateful Eight," A rewarding slow burner
","The Hateful eight1. The whole film is built on conversations. 2. This film has 5 parts & one needs patience to get through the first 3 parts.3. The last 2 parts are much faster, and is a good mystery, and the master Tarantino shows his classOverall this is an unique film even for Tarantino, with wonderful acting, dialogues, beautiful locale, good art direction, and a good suspense.My verdict - A rewarding slow burner, and a must watch for Tarantino fans, but may not appease all..This review is purely based on my personal experience with the film, not necessarily the merit of the film itself. You may interpret that as you will...",8,7,28,24 December 2015
Dunkirk," Highest rated Worst War movie ever.
","Dunkirk should be the first & most boring film directed by Christopher Nolan.Went in with huge expectations for this film. But it was a total let down. This movie is Intense from start to finish, but all that intensity is misfired, and an average moviegoer would feel this movie is a total bore fest. Dunkirk is an experience, not entertainment, and one would expect a war movie to be intense and entertaining, which Dunkirk isn't.Dunkirk should be the Highest rated Worst War movie ever.",6,8,18,21 July 2017
Ex Machina," That Intelligent flick you were looking for
","One of my most awaited watches this year 'Ex-Machina' starring Alicia Vikander, Domhnall Gleeson, Oscar Isaac did not disappoint me and played out to be an excellent one.Intelligent dialogs, Excellent casting, direction and its ability to play its audience like a piano in revealing its mysteries gracefully is the biggest positive of this movie.Though one may term it as an one time watch and even slow, a true movie lover will understand its subtle and at times even haunting messages and realize its greatness.Though it borrows concepts from films such as Artificial intelligence,it definitely hits the right notes and one to watch out.",8,1,5,17 May 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," Splendid showcase of sheer action
","I have never seen anything like this before.Astounding and jaw-dropping action scenes make this film a must watch for all movie lovers. Complemented by wonderful 3D special effects and top notch production values, Mad Max Fury Road is a marvelous visual spectacle that no one should miss.A particular sequence of scenes towards the end of the first hour is so amazing that it is like no other out there, and makes us realize the reason we love movies. Fast paced and spell binding first hour matched by an equally worthy second. Highly Recommended flick. Go watch it in theaters, thank me later. What a lovely Day!!!!!!!!",8,9,18,16 May 2015
