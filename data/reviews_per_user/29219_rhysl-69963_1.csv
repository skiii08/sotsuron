Blade Runner 2049," Visually stunning but too long.
","The film is visually stunning. Featuring great cityscapes, good use of colour and excellent visual effects. The story is not bad either but is ruined by the length of the film. The film is way too long and the fact that the movie is so long makes the story feel stretched out and boring.",1,4,7,15 December 2017
