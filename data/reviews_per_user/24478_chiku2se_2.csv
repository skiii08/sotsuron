Vertigo," A brilliant movie
",An excellent masterpiece by the mystery master Hitchcock's. The first hour and a half will give you a feel of a supernatural thriller. The next half hour unfolds into a murder mystery. This movie once again takes away the viewer by surprise. James Stewart has given a brilliant performance in the role of a private detective who retires from his job because of spells of vertigo. He is offered a job by his close friend to keep an eye on his wife who hasn't been behaving herself lately. After initial hesitation he accepts and in the process fall sin love with her. While following her he believes that a supernatural phenomenon related to her ancestral tragedy as the cause of her bizarre behavior and her tendency to commit suicide. It is Hitchocks style of unfolding the scenes by which he makes the viewer fall into the trick of believing what he wants them to believe. The finale of this movie is amazing. The last 10s of the movie presents something which would be unthinkable by any viewer.,8,2,4,17 October 2005
Notting Hill," Irritating movie
","Notting Hill is a very simple and ordinary movie. The movie will be liked by those who watch it without needing explanations for the happenings. Right from the beginning it leaves holes in the script. A famous actress comes to a book store and goes unnoticed by the crowd of that town!! Several characters in the movie find themselves proud to have lunch or talk with the celebrity but knew nothing about the movies she acted in!! The character of Anna Scott (Julio Roberts) is half-baked. In the initial half of the movie she is portrayed as a simple, straightforward person with an unassuming personality. She fells in love with an ordinary man William (Hugh Grant) who owns a book-store. The sequence in which she stays overnight with William and shares bed with him indicates her willingness of a long term relationship with him. In the very next frame when she is exposed by the media, she lambastes the same person and considers him responsible for all the mess and leaves him. William seems to be an absolute draft in this sequence. Why the hack he could not prevent Anna and then his eccentric house-mate from going out of the apartment when he knew that there is a huge crowd of media waiting outside. Six months later for no reason explained in the movie Anna comes back and 'begs' William to love her. Six months of abstention from a person could actually subdue any feelings William if at all she had any. However in the movie it happened differently. There are so many sequences which will leave you in awe due to missing conversations which you would normally expect. For example when Williams's sister reveals that she is engaged to someone William expresses his surprise. But to my surprise he didn't bothered to ask who she got engaged to.This movie could be viewed without getting irritated only if you overlook all these holes in the script. If you view with a normal mind set it will start getting on your nerves very soon. The only intelligent sequence was when William declines Anna when she returns to him for the second time. I love suspense thrillers specially Alfred Hitchcock's' movies. Give it a miss if you carry a critical view point while watching a movie. I will give it 4/10.",4,1,5,16 October 2005
