Hereditary," I want my 2 hours back!
","I was hoping it would get better, but it never did. If anything it became worse. So disappointed and angry I wasted my time.",1,2,6,13 July 2019
Rocketman," ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!
","I didn't expect the movie to be put together like a musical, but in a way, I'm glad it was! Because I enjoyed how the characters sung along and took on bits of the lyrics of the songs that related to their characters or their current circumstances. Very clever!All round amazing performances, fabulous costumes, songs and many heart touching moments that had me in tears.Don't miss ROCKETMAN as it's simply fabulous!",10,3,5,17 June 2019
