The Blair Witch Project," An exalting review of the Blair Witch Project
","This movie presents itself as a great book, exposing the psychological turmoil of three student film makers lost deep in the forests surrounding Burkittsville Maryland and hunted by an unseen evil presence.  Stylistically the film views as an ameteur video shot through a home video camera which adds to the realistic suspense present in the film maker's lost footage. Unfortunately, the style of the film will undoubtedly lend itself to negative criticism from viewers entrenched in the superficiality of the high priced - low substance modern american film.  It is a movie that requires the ablility to think independently by using one's own imagination and perceptions.  The Blair Witch Project is a must see.",10,1,2,2 August 1999
