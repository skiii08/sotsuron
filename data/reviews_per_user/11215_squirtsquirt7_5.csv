The King's Speech," Fantastic film filled with class and brilliance
","I went to the movies last night with a group of friends. I didn't care what we saw but one of them picked 'The Kings Speech.' I got to say I had heard great reviews about it but wasn't particularly interested in seeing it, it honestly seemed dull to me.Well it turns out that it was a fantastic film. An extremely powerful movie filled with class and excellent acting performances. Colin Firth was sensational as was Geoffrey Rush. It was a really wonderful movie and very inspiring. It also was a bit funny at times. Michael Gambon also did a wonderful job as King George V.A tip though, do not go to see it at 10PM at night like I did when you've already had a full day because it does move slow at times. I honestly probably would've enjoyed it more if I saw it during the day. If all you want is guns going off and cars exploding, this isn't the movie for you, but if you want a well told story with amazing actors, this is what you want to see, an easy 9/10 for me.",9,0,1,23 January 2011
Cloverfield," Unbelievably bad!
","MAJOR SPOILERS!!!!! I had been looking forward to this movie since May. When I finally saw it on January 23rd, I was stunned. Stunned at how high my expectations were because this movie was really bad. The hand-held camera got so annoying, I was almost sick at the end. There was no satisfaction, everyone died at the end. Well, maybe not but they don't lead you to believe anything else because at the beginning it said the government found the camera. SOUNDS LIKE THEY ALL DIED!!!! the party scene at the beginning was way too long, and I had no clue what was going on because it was so dark. The only reason I didn't give it a 1 was because of the actors. They were good in their roles, playing the scared and freaked out part. Also the monster wasn't too bad. But overall i expected a lot more from J.J. Abrahms, someone who created hit shows such as 'Alias' and 'Lost'. I was very disappointed with this movie and I wish I could get my money back!!!!!",3,7,14,23 January 2008
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," WOW! Number Five Lives up to the hype!
","This movie was excellent!! The story was great and it related to the book amazingly! The acting was great, Daniel Radcliffe and the rest have really grown into remarkable actors. OK, a few scenes were left out, like McGonagall being stunned and Harry trashing Dumbeldores office and Ron on the Quidditch team, but you can't exactly put all 870 pages into a non boring movie. Non-readers of the book would never want to sit for that long. I must say I love the books and the movies and this one was remarkable. The action and special effects were great! So, I must say even if you are not a Potter fan, go see this movie if you want to get lost in an incredible, breathtaking, and well acted movie!",10,0,2,15 July 2007
Taken," A fantastic thrill ride! Neeson is at his best!
","I just got back from seeing this movie and all I can say is Wow. What an adventure this movie provided. The suspense and action was non-stop and perfectly executed. Liam Neeson, whom I'm not used to seeing in a 'full on action' movie was perfect in this role. You could see the hurt on his face in certain scenes as well as the importance of a situation and the love for his daughter. I've always liked him and felt he was a great actor but he was off the hook in this movie. I don't want to give away any of the plot so all I will say is, this is one of the best movies I have ever seen and if you haven't seen it yet, get out there and see it because it packs a wallop and is a very fun and satisfying movie to see!",10,3,8,1 February 2009
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," A Brilliant and Satisfying conclusion to the best movie franchise in the world!
","The End of an Era.Well here I am, writing a review for the final Harry Potter Film. I knew this day would come for many years now but I am still in a very melancholy mood while writing this. The Harry Potter series was my childhood. I was 10 years old when the first movie came out, and I am now 20. I feel like I have grown up right alongside these actors and to finally be saying goodbye to them, is like saying goodbye to a friend, and also saying goodbye to my childhood.One thing I have to point out before anything else is the acting, it was just Oscar worthy. Dan, Emma and Rupert have grown into wonderful young actors and they all have very bright futures ahead. Alan Rickman, as stated by Daniel Radcliffe, does in fact give the performance of his career, he was incredible. The real star of this movie though, was Ralph Fiennes, that man is one of the best actors I have ever had the pleasure of watching. He brings Lord Voldemort to life in an impressive way and every time he was on screen I was completely mesmerized.The Film itself, was truly epic. From the beginning of Snape peering out over the Hogwarts students(a very intense shot, great work on that camera angle), to the very touching epilogue, this film gets it right. Out of all the Potter movies, this one seems perfect and relates to the book extremely well. The effects are visually stunning, and the music is perfect.I don't want to give too many plot details away, so I'll end my review here. This film is brilliant, not only the best Potter movie, but possibly the best film of the year. I'm not ashamed to admit that I cried during the end, during the epilogue scene, with that wonderful score playing. It truly is amazing, I can't say enough about it. When the movie was over, my audience cheered and applauded, it was well deserved.",10,0,0,19 July 2011
