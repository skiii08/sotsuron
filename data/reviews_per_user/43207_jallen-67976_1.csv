10 Cloverfield Lane," Engagingly intimate and tension packed film
",When the film started I was afraid it was going to be another 'lifetime movie' escape plot and when the Sci-Fi aspects were introduced I started doubting it even more but this film highly exceeded my expectations.It was engaging from start to (almost) finish and every time you think you have a grasp of the direction of the film it takes another turn. The characters were well acted and and provided enough background without distracting from the plot. It takes place in a small underground bunker with only three main cast members making it extremely intense and at points horrifying. Michelle is strong protagonist and though she is a bit too resourceful at points she is believable and smart she dose not try to escape with out a plan and even when she doubts Howards theory's and intentions she is not naive and pays attentions to the signs. Over all the film was soo well balanced and acted that I couldn't put it into a singular category. I highly recommend this film as it gives a new life to the Sci-Fi post apocalyptic film world that focuses on the people and well developed characters rather than overblown special effects and cheap action scenes. This brings me to my only problem with the film the ending. I though they were smart to make Howard's fantastical story's a reality my emotions tended to mirror those of the protagonist on weather I should trust him or either he was insane or both but either way I wanted out. The battle scene with the aliens was beyond my suspension of disbelief and wasn't needed.If she had simply saw the aliens set off a distraction and was able to escape in the car where she hears the radio announcement it would have stayed true to the atmosphere previous established by the movie without smacking the viewer in the face with the twist at the end. Other than that well worth watching.,8,1,2,16 August 2016
