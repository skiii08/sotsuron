Ford v Ferrari," Glorious. Victorious. Terrific acting performance by Christian Bale. Solid Car Flick!
","Victorious story about American car racing, with a brilliant acting performance by Christian Bale.The story is about the friendship between 2 total car fanatics, who live and breath cars all their lives (Matt Damon and Christian Bale). Together they achieved something never done before (or since) in American racing history: they won the biggest European racing championship called Le Mans, 4 times in a row!Not only suited for car fanatics, because there is a certain victorious feel to this movie and a long life friendship, that is undeniably attractive to watch for anybody.Any bad? It's not groundbreaking in any way. It's simply a car movie. A great, victorious one though, with excellent acting. Really enjoyed it.",8,0,0,16 February 2020
Moneyball," Glorious, true to life, uplifting underdog story that touches my heart! Wonderful actor's gem elevated by brilliant photography. Much bigger than merely a sports movie.
","Funny, uplifting, fascinating and touching. I would settle for less! An underdog glory story, based on real events! Ever felt abandoned or rejected for reasons of race, gender, looks or certain individual flaws? 'Moneyball' is a wonderful, uplifting story about looking past race, gender or individual flaws in sports. It's much bigger than just a 'simple' sports story though.'Moneyball' is a drama about a small baseball team managed by Brad Pitt, who accidentally discovers the incredible power of computer statistics in analysing new sports talents. Common practice nowadays, but revolutionary back then. One team (managed by Brad Pitt) was the first to use it and they shocked the entire sports industry. That is a terrific story in itself, but what makes this story much more interesting to me other then the revolutionary computer tactics, is the struggle to become the best AND the RISK of losing everything. THAT'S the real drama behind this movie!This glorious underdog story is being portrayed with magnificent acting AND directing performances with photography and images that are just to die for. IMAGES are EMOTIONS in Moneyball! This cinema photographer (cameraman) called Wally Pfister (remember that name AND fame) is creating continuous pictures that are just TO DIE FOR. He has filmed brilliant, massively popular classics like 'Memento', and 'The Dark Knight' His images TOUCH my heart! Very much ADORE it!'Moneyball' is a true winner, which really touched me deeply from the get go. Because it has it's heart upon it's sleeve. It's in your face, but in a real, heartfelt, true to life kind of way. Okay, this movies story is about baseball, but this stories spirit, is bigger than simply another sports movie. It's about love. About giving everything, about risking everything you believe in. Very touching and endearing. Wonderful actor's gem.",10,0,0,19 June 2018
Blade Runner 2049," It aint 'Star Wars'. And how pleased I am about that!
","Blade Runner is sciencefiction. HOWEVER, sciencefiction fans who search for mindless 'Star Wars' entertainment probably wont be pleased with this Blade Runner sequel, because it hasnt got the Star Wars 'fun factor'. And how pleased I am about that! I really cant stand those Star Wars franchise series and anything that looks like it. Fortunately 'Blade Runner 2049' is totally different than the usual hollywood sciencefiction franchise crap.'Blade Runner 2049' has got an almost hypnotizing slow dynamic. It is as if one is submerged into a mindset unlike any other science fiction I have ever watched, besides similar mesmerizing worlds of fantasy in the other great sci-fi classics like the original Blade Runner and the magnificent 'Alien' of the same director Ridley Scott.Blade Runner 2049 is about an android killer machine who has got to track down other robots which have to be terminated. This story truly excels at the suspense that one cant tell the difference any more between who is machine and who is human.I was really in awe of the world and the mood the director created with the use of gloriously dark pounding music. The soundtrack really was AS important as the visuals were. Highly recommended to listen to this movie with headphones or good speakers, because the bass tones will create ambient dark spaces that one can 'swim' in for hours on end.I really felt transported into another world by the stunning visuals. I mean, they were just breathtakingly dark and ominous. Excellent Oscar worthy photography by the famous Roger Deakins! Days later I still had these gorgeous visuals floating in my mind.'Blade Runner 2049' impressed me on a level few other scifi movies have ever done. It's a visual and sonic mindtrip into another world. Villeneuve's direction is what made this possible, because he is capable of creating a continuous suspenseful mood. Even when not much is happening in the story this dark but alluring suspenseful mood is constantly present. Difficult to describe and other people might simply will experience this dark mood as boring, but I really was in awe of this mesmerizing dark mood which the director had created.I have now watched it for the second time and I could better understand the somewhat difficult storyline. I enjoyed it even more the second time around. Blade Runner 2049 has all the merits and power of becoming a new sci-fi classic. Time will tell..",9,0,4,29 March 2018
First Man," The lead character is NOT interesting and Gosling's acting performance (as usual) is wooden, making this movie rather tedious to watch. Lacking in any new viewpoints.
","Armstrong was simply not an interesting guy. Focussing an entire movie around his character WILL cause A problem:boredom. If one were to TRY to make such an introvert, flat character like Armstrong interesting one would need a much more subtle actor AND a more interesting screenplay. First Man is basically Gosling trying to do his thing, resulting in nothing much more than a barely acceptable (wooden) acting performance. Barely acceptable...It looks reasonably pretty, but not in such a way that I would advice anyone to go see it. I constantly was reminded of seeing 'Gravity', when I watched this movie. Because 'Gravity' truly was IMPRESSIVE to look at, while this movie simply seems to piggyback on those same impressive space photography looks and failing at it. Trying to copy someone else's brilliant photography style often merely results in disappointment. Even the music score reminded me in parts of the same score in 'Gravity'. Watch the brilliant 'Gravity' instead of this Ryan Gosling humdrum, that would be my advice.This movie is definitely lacking in punch and spirit. It is lacking in new viewpoints as well.",6,1,2,15 September 2019
Scarface," Animal like Pacino howls at the world in rage!
","Great movie to watch if you had a bad day. Seen it so many times now that the initial shock has worn of a bit, but it is still a thrilling tale of how drugs and violence in the end always come back to haunt you.This classic lasts for almost 3 hours. It is a slowburning portrait of the rise AND fall of a Cuban criminal who made it big in the drugs business by ruthlessly eliminating his competition. The true charm of this movie lies in the magnificent performance by Al Pacino. This actor can get angry, like no other. His rage is animal like and true to life.You feel in every sense that this man is out of control!'Scarface' had gotten bad reviews when it was first released back in the eighties, but that didnt withold it from becoming an audiences favorite gangster classic. Now it is judged as such by critics also. Why was it slashed when it was released? I presume because of the gore. 'Scarface' is one of the most raw gangster films ever made. For that period of time it was considered to be a shocking portrayal of violence in bad taste. Even to this day, it still has got big brazen balls, with especially one horrific scene where a guy gets tortured with a chainsaw. This movie got a bad name for its violence, but by todays standards it is considered mainstream. Suited for 16 years and older. And if you skip the 'chainsaw' scene, 12 years and older.Note the terrible eighties music. It was bad then, it is still bad now. But that bad soundtrack is featured in such a great classic that the terrible poppy tunes dont irritate too much. It has even gained some cult status! And by the way, those were truly the disco sounds of that era in which the Cuban crime wave hit America.",10,0,0,26 September 2018
Walk the Line," Endearing tribute to one of the most beautiful American voices
","Endearing tribute.The music Johnny Cash has made is dark, soulful, magnificent, chilling and uplifting. But what is especially terrific about this movie is Joaquin Phoenix' performance in which he uses his own singing voice. Joaquin Phoenix is literally singing the Johnny Cash songs himself, with stunning resemblance and heartfelt soul.If that isnt enough to recommend this movie then there is a great tragic romance to be enjoyed as well, in which Reese Witherspoon shines brighter than ever in her role as the elusive girlfriend/bandmember of Johnny Cash.For all those who have never heard of Johnny Cash, this movie is an excellent start to know this soulful artist. For any fan it is a feast to watch as well. His music lives on after his death, being one of the greatest American voices who has ever lived...",8,2,2,17 June 2019
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Much lesser sequel and this sequel's story is a complicated MESS. Who wrote this? Fire that person.
","Sequels are always doomed. Or aren't they? This sequel is simply more of the same, much less fun than the original though.The good: as in the original there is terrific (CGI) ACTION photography and ACTION editing, seeing is believing, this movie simply splashes of the screen, with it's gorgeous portrayal of 18th century London and Paris. Who cares? I do. It's still an action movie alright, but it definitely looks the part as well.The bad: the story is a complete MESS. I am being serious here. Just cant make sense of if. There is more bad: there is NOT a great villain. There is NO great mystery. What? Yes, no mystery in a Sherlock Holmes movie!!! Even the jokes are less funny. It simply is a less charming sequel, which merely copies the original, adding nothing new...",5,0,0,19 April 2020
Mission: Impossible III," MI-3 rocks hard. Philip Seymour Hoffman lifts it up. Action is thrilling and non-stop.
","MI- 3 is the third Mission Impossible in the series. And it is one of the best. Not the best, but it comes close. Seen it over 5 times now and I still do enjoy it very much. It really has stood the test of time.What makes MI-3 especially thrilling is the acting performance of the bad guy played by none other than legendary Philip Seymour Hoffman. Without a doubt Hoffman plays the most convincing crook in the whole Mission Impossible series. This ferociously vicious character gives MI-3 it's cojones.The action is over the top and non-stop, like it should be. But it is still credible action, not of the ridiculous kind, well a bit ridiculous, but still very very enjoyable. What a rush! This movie furthermore has a real gritty, tough feel to it. I really liked that. But there are still some excellent jokes in between to lighten things up. And for the first time there is a romance interwoven into the story. I normally hate romances in action movies, but it works well.I get all I could wish for in a good Mission Impossible series: non stop powerful action with hilarious stunts, tight story and terrific acting performances. I can enjoy this movie over and over again. What a thrill!",8,2,2,10 May 2018
The Finest Hours," Disney feelgood shipwreck movie based on true story. Only flaw is its sugarcoated sentiment, but that makes it ideally suited for kids and family entertainment.
","In this shipwredk film, the action was portrayed quite suspenseful, although some special effects were rather cheesy. But then again this film is defenitely targetted at families and kids, who wont be so critical if special effects dont seem true.Casey Affleck is a favorite actor of mine and he stands for quality just by his presence. I dont know any movies with him that I dont like. In this movie he again is the best actor, by a landslide. I still didnt expect much from a disney movie, but I got pleasantly surprised by the suspense of the story anyway. The only flaw of this movie is the fact that it is a bit too much sugarcoated. The story is about a shipwreck with men fearing for their lives, but it is fair to say that the director went for a smooth, nice looking feelgood picture, so there isnt much desperation or panic to be seen, because otherwise it couldnt be sold as a family picture anymore. Now young kids can watch this suspenseful film too, without getting too scared. There is also a budding romance interwoven into the story. Women/girls will love that, but being a guy I never care much for romances in action movies. Fortunately the budding romance scenes are not many.I wont wanna see this movie again, because now I know how the story ends, the suspense is gone. And the suspense is really the only thing that kept this movie afloat. It is an ideal family film though, which will be a thrill for young kids too. In the end I blame Disney for the sugarcoating of this movie and not the director. Adults who got a little bit bored at moments watching this disney movie, might wanna check out oscar winner 'I, Tonya' from the same director that is definitely only suited for adults with all the swearing and drugs...",6,0,0,21 July 2018
3:10 to Yuma," Great, slowburning story with lots of dialogues, reasonably good acting and direction. Just a nice western, just nice.
","The story in itself is quite simple: Christian Bale has to escort the crook Russel Crowe to court. But the dynamic and dialogues of the story are quite enjoyable. It could have been directed more bleak and grim. The original story lends itself to that mood, but director James Mangold made this story into an average commercial hollywood western, therefore it wont ever become a western classic, but it is still quite an enjoyable watch. Can be enjoyed by young and old, because the nucleus of this story is about a father son relationship, in which the father wants to risk death by bringing Russel Crowe to court, just to prove to his son, that he is a Man.Based on an Elmore Leonard story, an author that is one of Quentin Tarantino favorites. 'Jackie Brown' is based on another Elmore Leonard story, just to give you an example. Lots of dialogues in this western. Not too much action. And what those Leonard stories also have in common is that the characters are true to life people. Although there are better westerns to be found, this one has got its merits because of its great story and reasonably good acting by Russel Crowe and Christian Bale.",7,1,2,16 September 2018
The Equalizer," Mediocre direction and stupid story. BUT Denzel Washington is still worth the watch...
","I would never recommend this movie to anyone, but to those who just wanna watch a mindnumbing action movie. Sometimes I'm in the mood for a B-movie as well.'The Equalizer' is just that. But watch the 'Taken' series with Liam Neeson instead, because it is much more gratifying to watch: more original, suspenseful and more and better action too.I cant help but compare 'The Equalizer' to the 'Taken' series, because they look like copies of eachother, in which 'The Equalizer' is the bad copy though, because everything about the 'Equalizer' is mediocre and has been done before. And has been done a lot better. A LOT. It is worse enough that the story is just plain dumb, but the rest is average as well: the photography, editing, soundtrack are all anoyingly mediocre as well. The supporting actors who play the bad guys are just stupid and not convincing at all, they resemble game characters that can be shot with one kill in easy mode. Just anoyingly boring.The acting by Denzel Washington however is good. He saves this movie from drowning. Without his part, this movie wouldnt even have made it to the cinemas. But WITH Denzel this movie is still watchable. Ideal for young kids, who just want a plain, simple hero who wins every fight.Instead of this crap I would highly recommend 'Training Day' . That's another Antoine Fuqua movie starring Denzel Washington, but that movie is brilliant, suspenseful and true to life. Just spectacular. Everything 'The Equalizer' is NOT.",4,0,1,21 August 2018
Skyfall," Great actor's edition of the Bond series featuring a magnificent cast with Javier Bardem, Ralph Fiennes and Albert Finney. Topped with the brilliant direction by Sam Mendes
","This Bond is suited for arthouse movie lovers as well! And that is a rare and noteworthy chararcteristic for a Bond movie, which are usually quite lame and only made to please the masses. Anyone ofcourse can enjoy this 'special Bond edition', but this edition is very dear to me, because for the first time acting in a Bond movie is taking seriously and the terrific acting performances by Javier Bardem, Ralph Fiennes and Albert Finney are to be thanked for that. Topped of with the brilliant direction by Sam Mendes. This is seriously something else in the James Bond genre, quality wise speaking.This Bond really went out of its way to make it something really special: it is RAW and REAL. And it has got story twists never seen before in any Bond, in all of its history. Really, all cliches went out of the window and everything was up for grabs. Young viewers wont notice these sublte differences ofcourse, but for all those adults (40+) who have been watching Bond since the sixties or seventies, this edition is really unique and special, storywise. Doesnt mean you like it, maybe you will even NOT like it for the same reasons I DO like it, but I only wanna applaud that this edition is SPECIAL.This Bond has got a feel to it none of all the other modern Bond editions have had. It was made in the spirit that it could have been the last Bond ever made. It wasnt the last though, but it was one of the very best, if not the best modern Bond ever! That's just my humble opinion though, who isnt a Bond movie fan by the way. So my opinion could easily clash with all the regular fans. This review is mainly written for all those who would never consider watching such a commercially bland Hollywood procuct. THIS is your chance to be pleasantly surprised.And I love that Adele song! One of the best modern Bond songs!",8,1,4,16 August 2018
Catch Me If You Can," Funny portait of a con artist (Leonardo di Caprio), who is being pursued by detective Tom Hanks. Will Di Caprio pull of the perfect con and stay free from persecution?
","The bad: this movie does last about an half hour too long to be really captivating till the very end. Because when all the con tricks have been played out, the magic of this upbeat con story has somewhat faded. At 2 hours and 15 minutes this movie overstretches it's attention span.The good: cheery, upbeat story about a boy who wants to be succesful and figures out a conning way to do so, when he knows that the honest way to achieve succes is out of his league, because of poverty problems. By simply impersonating pilots, doctors and lawyers this boy succeeds in achieving the succes he always dreamt of. It is a very alluring story about tricking your way into succes and the constant chase between Di Caprio and Tom Hanks makes for a suspenseful game of cat and mouse.
Really enjoyable watch for young and old, with a romantic interlude with the very young Amy Adams.Biographical end note: director Steven Spielberg parents got divorced, when he was a kid. Many of the themes in Spielberg's films are about single parents and this movie is no exception. It is striking to see that this movies plot is also about a boy, who sees his parents struggle with financial problems and end up in a divorce. The boy copies his father's behaviour to solve his financial difficulties, by trying to con his way out of debt, in order to bring home the bacon. The father fails at his con jobs, whereas the son, played by Leonardo di Caprio, succeeds in conning his way into succes... Quite charming.",7,0,2,21 February 2019
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Action adventure classic. Silly, yet still good fun after so many years...
","It's an action adventure, with a romance and that is exactly what you are gonna get. It's quite silly at moments (the special effects havent dated well) and dont talk me about credibility, but those things dont matter, what matters is having a good time, forgetting about all your worries, having a laugh and dream of being as tough and cool as Indiana...The good: action upon action, it's a rollercoaster fun action movie. It even has got a great budding romance. And what better bad guys than the Nazis.The bad: it's silly entertainment and the jokes and the acting in this edition arent as good as in the 3rd edition with Sean Connery starring.",7,0,0,27 April 2020
Deepwater Horizon," The after taste of this above average action movie is bitter because it is whitewashing the worst ever oil disaster by NOT EVER mentioning the impact on the environment.
","Just looked upon as an action/drama movie it is reasonably good, because the stunts and special effects are pretty impressive and the sentiments (violins, crying houswives and children) about the loss of 11 people is done with much effective melodrama towards the end. Great photography and editing and quite good acting performances by Kurt Russel and John Malkovich. Mark Wahlberg, as ever, just looks plain dumb, but for his standards he acts good as well. So just judging it as an action/drama it will make pass the time enjoyably, without ever getting really bored.The biggest criticism I have is what this movie does NOT show. What is not being shown? What is not even mentioned one single time? The devastating permanent impact on the environment. None of that is ever mentioned. That is ridiculous and whitewashing the actual events as they have happened. As if this was only a human drama and not also the worst environmental oil disaster in recorded history. I have got a bitter after taste because of that whitewashing of this historical environmental disaster.",5,1,6,25 January 2019
Casablanca," What a joy to watch those faces, those beautifully photographed faces! I just keep clicking the pause button, only to admire that magnificent angelic face of Ingrid Bergman.
","The story? Humphrey Bogart had a short affair with Ingrid Bergman. The 2 lovers parted abruptly and never saw each other again, untill they accidentally meet again in Casablanca during World War II. Will love blossom again?Wanna see a real black and white classic romantic picture? Look no further than 'Casablanca'. I dont usually get easily excited about romantic movies, but 'Casablance' is definitely something else and then some! What a powerful alluring romantic story, photographed in a way that is just breathtaking. I mean I just dont know the equal of it. Ingrid Bergman just looks so magnificently innocent and angelic, that I keep hitting the pause button almost every other 10 minutes when there is another still shot of her face to be admired. All the characters though are photographed in a way that is just to die for. What a terrific still shots.All considered, there is not a lot of romance to be seen in this movie to be honest. That may sound strange, because I just labeled it as a terrific romantic movie, which it is, but 'Casablance' starts out as a suspenseful cat and mouse game, between the german nazi's and a wanted resistance leader during World War II. The romance part stealthily sneaks into the movie later on and builds up in strength. And what strength of passion there is to be admired! Highly recommended. You got to at least give this classic a try, BUT be patient, because 'Casablanca' starts out quite slow, so dont expect fireworks from the beginning, but it gets better and better near the end. What a glorious romantic end...",9,2,3,13 February 2019
Training Day," Tough, Tougher, Toughest

Chinatown," They should built a shrine for this classic, so that every cinephile can worship it every day in honor of its brilliance...
","Every movie lover knows about the brilliance of Roman Polanski's 'Chinatown'. If you are reading these reviews you havent seen it yet, which positions you in a place at the gates of heaven. You have not entered heaven yet, but you will once you decide to walk through the gates and watch 'Chinatown'. I am rather jealous of you, because the first time is special, although the great thing about movies is, that the most wonderful stories CAN be relived time and again. 'Chinatown¨ is up there with the all time greatest movies of american cinema history. The absolute pinnacle of genius.That must be enough praise to get you curious. My real advice would be not to read any further. Not my review, nor anyone elses. I just wanted to make sure with my first paragraph that you wont make the unforgivable mistake of passing this movie by. You havent lived without having seen it...The story takes place in L.A. in the thirties, in the middle of a period of drought there is a big conflict about how to get more water to the city. A previous water reservoir had collapsed and killed 500 innocent L.A. citizens and now they plan to built another one with the same faults that were present in the earlier disaster. Enter Jack Nicholson as a private investigator who at first gets an assignment that seemingly has nothing to do at all with this disaster which cost so many people's lives. He just has to research if a husband is cheating on his wife. What seems an innocent and tedious job, soon becomes a life threatening case, when Jack Nicholson finds out more than he is supposed to know about the powers that be, that want to build this risky dam, come hell or high water...The story truly is very intelligent, suspenseful and emotionally devastating and has won many awards. The number of awards is mindboggling so I wont start listing them here, but it suffices to say that everything, and I truly mean everything, could be and has been awarded about this movie. I just want to restrain myself, in order to limit the length of this review. No I cant. I just GOT TO mention everything. I'll keep it 'short'. The acting. Let's start with that. Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway and John Huston truly play the roles of their lives. Images so pure and intense that I can see them by just mentioning the name 'Chinatown'. The photography by John A. Alonzo (Scarface) is breathtaking. Almost every scene is shot in the magic hours, when the sun rises or sets and delivers shadows and golden colors that only last for some 30 minutes every day. All the images are bathing in this glow of early sunset. Almost every scene could be a poster, that is how gorgeous the photography is. Finally the music score by Jerry Goldsmith, who is a music genius. With a minimum of instruments he creates another 'leading role', because his music is intertwined with the heart of this movie. Yes, his music score is so powerful and sublime that it is unimaginable to think of 'Chinatown' without these dissonant piano string chords and gorgeous dreamlike trumpet themes. Jerry Goldsmith's music scores are even being used after his passing, every year till this very day, movies are released with themes from earlier scores by this brilliant composer.In the end we have to thank Director Roman Polanski for his genius in bringing all these talents together and creating something which will be seen by generations to come. In a time capsule of movie history Roman Polanski's masterpiece will shine as a star among the very greatest that american cinema has ever achieved.",10,2,3,8 June 2018
Gravity," Visually and sonically impressive portrait about survival...
","Visually and sonically mindblowing portrait about survival in deep space. Deservedly a multiple oscar winner for visuals and sound. I have seen many many many scifi pictures in space and Gravity beats them ALL hands down with its stunning visuals and pulsating deep soundsDramatically speaking there is a SMALL weak point though in the fact that this is basically a movie about 1 person, who is totally ALONE. She (Sandra Bullock) talks to herself constantly, while she is trying to get back to earth after her space shuttle imploded. It is quite difficult to make great drama when a person is totally by herself, dressed up in a space suit. It is not the ideal set of circumstances to create great drama, but I have seen this movie many times now and the simultaneously presence of sheer desperation about the fear of dying AND the feverish UPLIFTING determination to make it back to earth alive is very impressive.Sandra Bulllock is not the greatest drama actress around, but she really gives one of her finest serious dramatic performances of her entire carreer.When I have watched this movie I feel empowered and glorious, when I havent even left my chair. THAT is how powerful this portrait about survival is. Chapeau! Masterful! I recommend it to all my friends and family and now also to you, dear Imdb reader...",8,0,1,20 June 2019
Erin Brockovich," Amazing true story. Feel good, funny and inspirational. Julia Roberts' Oscar winning portrait of a single mom who takes on a corrupt multinational.
","Amazing true story about a corrupt multinational that has been poisoning the drinking water of Americans. Julia Roberts is an uneducated single mom, who by accident gets a job at a law firm and despite having had no law experience whatsoever, she single handedly is the driving force behind taking on this huge, corrupt multinational to court. Not simply based on a true story, it is literally a TRUE story!What a terrific movie about female empowerment. But guys could love this story too, because it is funny, feel good and inspirational. And yes, Julia Roberts looks stunning with her low cut dresses, because she plays a character who is wary of how she should suppose to dress in a uptight law firm, therefore she just dresses as if she went to a bachelor party, because she likes the way she looks. Who could blame her...Seen this flick many times now and this is really becoming better the more often I watch it. The fact that the same jokes are still incredibly funny after repeated viewing, says a lot about the terrific true to life dialogues. It isnt a comedy though, the jokes simply rise out of ordinary daily conflicts.I am not a particularly huge Julia Roberts fan, but her acting is truly superb. Julia Roberts got her well deserved Oscar for best actress. BUT the supporting actors are terrific as well. Albert Finney in particular is hilarious in his role of Julia Roberts' boss, who just cant keep up with the energy and crazy ideas she has.Ultimately director Steven Soderbergh is to be thanked for creating this precious gem. What a joy to watch again and again...",9,0,0,12 August 2018
Meet the Parents," Comedy classic. Solid as a rock. Terrific acting by the dorky Ben Stiller and the maniacal Robert de Niro. Seen it many times, cracks me up again and again. Just great!
","What is so great about the very first 'Meet the Parents' edition, is the simple fact that the characters act credibly. However funny the scenes and misunderstandings can get, the seriousness with which everyone acts, adds to the credibility of the characters. I need to be able to believe in the characters, before I can laugh about the shameful and hilarious situations they get themselves into. This credibility is missing in the 2 sequels. Robert de Niro is the best in serious acting. The man becomes funny because he is FEARED. I constantly got the feeling that he could smash someones skull in with a baseball bat. There is always that looming maniac inside de Niro's characters. Combine that with the dorky goofiness of Ben Stiller and we've got a comedy match made in heaven.Need I tell the story? The title says it all. Ben Stiller is about to meet the parents of his girlfriend for the very first time and he is about to ask permission to marry the daughter of de Niro. Everything what can go wrong, will go hilariously wrong. Just watch and laugh your head off!",9,2,2,5 October 2018
Se7en," 'The world is a fine place and worth fighting for. I agree with the second part'
","For all those out there that have never seen 'Seven' there is only one advice: watch it and shiver. For anyone who is a movie lover of thrillers and detectives this is an absolute must see. You must be crazy if one would disregard this movie. I would only advice those people NOT to go see it if they are faint of heart, because this classic has some pretty gruesome killings in it. Although most of those killings arent shown, only the victims are shown, but they are shown in such a horrifying way that I still have to look away at some scenes.This is without a doubt the ultimate freak thriller slasher movie of the nineties. But mind you, it is NOT that there is much killings to be seen, no the suspense that another victim is gonna be killed rises to levels never before seen on the silver screen. It is what some call a mindf*k thriller and oh man does your mind get twisted with the sick but intelligent plot.Starring Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey who all perform at the peak of their talents. Oscars and dozens of awards worldwide were given to this unique piece of suspense horror. One of the most popular thrillers ever released in american movie history. This is something that just mesmirizes and shocks me again and again and I must have seen it over 20 times by now.The story is about Brad Pitt, playing a young detective married to Gwyneth Paltrow. Brad Pitt has to work with another detective Morgan Freeman to solve a serial killer case. The story sounds simple but the execution of it is mindboggling nervewrecking. I think to this day it is one of the most twisted sick thrillers I have ever seen, but it is directed so brilliantly that is a joy to watch from beginning to end. If you have never seen this movie you are in a very fortunate position, because the suspense is greatest when you dont know HOW this story will turn out. Enjoy and shiver!",10,0,0,14 August 2018
Unbreakable," Story starts credible and very suspenseful, ends somewhat cheap and kinda disappointing. Still a fascinating mystery thriller.
","Bruce Willis is the sole survivor of a trainwreck. For unexplicable reasons he walked away without a scratch. he seems unbreakable untill he meets a man who seems to be the opossite of him, played by Samuel L Jackson. What follows is an intelligent mystery thriller.This movie has a lot to offer: great acting by Bruce Willis, Samuel Jackson and a little unknown kid, who plays a magnificent role as the son of Bruce Willis. Great photography. Great music score. And lots of intelligent suspense. You just keep guessing what the heck is going on. And not untill the very end you will find out what the great mystery is all about.Unfortunately the end is somewhat cheap and disappointing. I would have preffered that there WASNT a rational explaination about the great mystery at the end, because it is always demystifying the suspense.Even with this disappointing ending it is still good enough though to recommend to others.",8,0,0,20 November 2018
As Good as It Gets," Jack is THE MAN. Incredibly blunt yet incredibly feel good as well. Gets better over the years. Rom com classic.
","Blunt lighthearted drama, yet so endearing and incredibly feel good and funny simultaneously. Even quite romantic near the end! There arent many movies like these that can offend yet charm the viewer simultaneously. The reason why it works is Jack Nicholson. Everybody loves Jack! And this actor legend can get away with murder and still charm the heck out of us viewers.Terrific acting performances by Helen Hunt, Cuba Gooding Jr. and Greg Kinear as well. This is a full on actors movie.The story is about Jack Nicholson who plays a rich mental weirdo with an obsession for cleanliness. He is afraid of doorknobs and of any fysical contact with other humans. He is a total control freak and anything out of the ordinary freaks him out. And this is exactly what is gonna happen to him, he loses control and then he starts noticing that he TOO does need other people for love and support.I have said it before, I will say it again, what is so endearing about this picture is its charming way in which it offends every person, race, religion or gender. Gotta see it, to believe that being a true *sshole can be incredibly funny and even endearing.Highly recommended for fans of Jack and for lovers of the quirky rom com genre. What the heck, this movie will please everyone with a longing to see a f*kup succeed in love while all odds are against him..,",10,1,1,2 January 2019
Train to Busan," Has the look and feel of a B movie, but this zombie movie turns out to be a rather good one. Great frenzy and gore. Riveting suspense and unnerving fight for survival.
","Didnt expect much of it at first. Looked like a cheap B movie, because of the low budget for special effects. But that low budget for special effects turns out to be a good thing, because what we get instead of boring CGI effects is great real life mass pursuits of zombies. And instead of boring CGI we get a lot of real life unnerving close up fights for survival with zombies in a high speed train.Yes, the bloody zombies dont look particularly convincing, but their frenzy is terrific nonetheless. Yes, for those nitpickers who complain about apparent loopholes in the story, there are indeed some, but they dont affect the movie's suspense. The actors arent particularly great either, but their characters are quite convincing nonetheless.Despite all these minor let downs I got really swept away with this suspenseful story about a korean dad, who wants to protect his young daughter from zombie attacks on a train. The 'zombies on a train' theme is rather interesting as well. All in all a really surprising, enjoyable and even emotionally touching zombie movie. 7 stars, but I will upgrade to 8 stars if this movie still stands strong after a second viewing.",7,0,1,17 February 2019
Inglourious Basterds," Somewhat silly plot, but nevertheless quite good suspense and juicy acting performances.
","Brad Pitt is undercover in Nazi Germany during World War II with a secret mission to kill Hitler. Will he succeed or die trying?The bad: this plot is rather silly at key moments, because some events that take place are simply not true to life or highly unlikely. Dont wanna nag about that flaw too much though, but it is a thing that bugs me nevertheless and it makes me only wanna award it with 8 stars, instead of 9 or 10.The good: the suspense is terrific. Tarantino is a master at building up suspense in long lasting scenes. The dialogues and characters are to die for, ranging from violently wicked to hilariously stupid.This is one of my favourite Tarantino movies of the last 20 years. It nowhere near equals Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs or Jackie Brown, but it comes close. Seen it many many times and I will enjoy it many more times to come.",8,2,3,23 January 2020

","Childish, even cheap looking (special effects) edtion of the series. Brie Larson is definitely cute and funny, but the rest of this movie is never interesting.The good: BrieThe bad: special effects are one of the most silly ones I have seen until now.

Alien: Resurrection," The Monster's Mother
","Accidentally stumbled into Alien 4 (Resurection). Remembered it as a watered down version. But I enjoyed it beyond expectations, although the ending seems a little cheap. Maybe they ran out of money because the special effects at the end are somewhat cheesy, but as a whole Alien 4 has almost the same energy and feel as Alien 2 (Aliens). The acting is particularly good in Alien 4. Better than in 2 and 3. I loved the stereotyped characters. The music is glorious as it should be. The effects are deliberately scaled down to gritty and dark, which is the way I like it. The first half of this movie is just as in the other versions the best part, because of the building up of the suspense. However once the monsters are beginning to attack it sort of demystifies the suspense and the action is not as well visually portrayed as has been done before, probably caused by the studios refusal to invest more money. This was a shock for the director who expected a bigger budget. But if you can look past some very cheap backsets and cheap explosions than the action, story and acting are enjoyable.Alien 4 was co produced by Sigourney Weaver so it is safe to assume she has had some influence on the story. She always had said before that she wanted to 'mate' with the monster in another sequel. And that 'mating' with the monster is what makes Alien 4 so special. Sigourney Weaver has become the mother of the monsters in Alien 4. Alien 4 has got some great humoristic oneliners that wouldnt look bad in an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie. The jokes are good so they add to the general funny feel of this Alien version.All in all a very enjoyable light Alien version but certainly not the best. But I like it more than Alien 3. Too bad for the cheap ending otherwise this 4th sequel could have been as enjoyable as some of the other editions.",7,3,4,28 March 2018
World War Z," New zombie classic
","Brad Pitt has to protect his family from a world that has gone viral with an epidemic of zombies. Will he find a cure to protect people from the zombies? That is the story. Not important really, because action and suspense is everything in World War Z and it is done brilliantly.Seen it once and I thought it was a very energetic and impressive zombieflick, but it felt like a formula film. Saw it a second time and was amazed how much I still loved the frenzy of this thriller. Then saw it a third, fourth...10th time and it has become my favorite zombie movie now and the frenzy like energy of this movie is to thank for that. It is truly a rollercoaster of actionscene upon actionscene. Very impressive adrenaline rush. Works better than coffee or redbull. You probably wont wanna go to bed at all after seeing this...What is particularly good about World War Z is that it comes close to a real life scenario in which people turn into zombies. I know this may sound stupid, but most zombie movies are so far removed from any reality that this movie really is a breather. Besides the zombies, anything else in this movie is portrayed very realistically, which makes the feverish longing to escape from the zombies even more intense.Brad Pitt has to protect his own family in the first place and the acting he does is very heartfelt. You want Brad's family to survive, you almost want to warn them when there is another zombie lurking around the corner. And regardless of how many times I have seen it, this movie reaches my gut and heart everytime. That is a good sign.World War Z really has everything to become a classic, because it gave the most chilling realistic portrayal of zombies ever done before. Really cant find any fault with this movie. Acting, photography, soundtrack, everything is just perfect. World War Z is the new standard for the ultimate zombie movie as far as I am concerned. A must see if you are into zombie movies. And a must see if you are into action movies. World War Z is a beast!Special mention to director Marc Foster who is NOT an action movie director at all. Besides 1 James Bond movie he hasnt made any action packed movies. On the contrary all of his movies are mostly shown in the arthouse filmtheatres. Check out: 'Stranger than fiction' (weird but original comedy), 'Monster's Ball' (racial drama).Maybe it is because of his background in mainly arthouse films that this zombie film rose beyond all the other ones...A sequel with Brad Pitt is planned for 2020...",10,0,1,30 March 2018
Mississippi Burning," Impressive portrait of the racist sixties in the Southern States of America. Great fighting spirit.
","Based on a true story about 3 civil rights activists in the sixties, who got murdered by Southern racists. This movie portrays the investigation by 2 F.B.I. agents, who are determined to bring the murderers to justice, come hell or high water.This movie has got a great fighting spirit. Anyone who would normally shy away from racial dramas because of all the misery in it, might wanna give this movie a try, because the racists get battered heavily and have to pay for their crimes. However painful it is to watch racism, this movie has deliberately subdued the amount of violence that can be seen, so even sensitive/younger people could watch this racial investigative drama, without getting shocked too intensely.The excellent acting by the 2 leading F.B.I. agents, Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe, is what makes this movie really stand out. One young FBI agent wants to do everything by the book, the other more experienced agent (Gene Hackan) is a lot more cunning and uses dirty tricks to get results. The movie focusses on the friendly friction between these 2 agents while combatting the southern racists. Very impressive portrait of the racist southern sixties. Gripping from beginning to end.",8,0,1,21 May 2019
The Impossible," NOT a disaster movie, but a bland hollywood formula movie with lots of violins and sentimental scenes.
","NOT a disaster movie at all, which is kinda odd, because this tsunami was one of the biggest natural disasters in history. Yes, we can see the disastrous tsunami flood at the beginning of the movie, depicted with impressive true to life special effects, but after 5 minutes of rampage the flood is miraculously calmed down. That's nothing even near what happened in real life. Well, let's forget about that flaw for a minute and let's focus on the story as it is presented.The fact that this movie is totally fixated on 1 family is rather narrowminded. Tens of thousands of other people have died, but we dont get to see them much. This tsunami disaster was only used as a plot for a sentimental tearjerker movie, in which 2 parents and their 3 children are constantly moaning and crying in a hospital. All being depicted in such a sentimental (violins!) way, that it soon becomes rather tedious to watch.Just a bland hollywood movie that has used the biggest natural disaster to milk out a sentimental script. Rather cheesy and self centered. Only to be recommended for those who like tear jerker dramas with lots of violins.",5,3,5,2 March 2019

It's quite timid instead with many B-actors, who just arent able to portray real fear. And they are held hostage, so one would expect some fearful faces. But heck no, these folks just cant act.

Knives Out," Ai ja jaih. Au...Why these exclamations of pain? Because this is the same director of Looper. Very fascinating at the start, but completely gibberish and mash patatoes.
","Beware. Now read again, BEWARE. This movie came from the same director that gave us 'Looper'. Fascinating and SEEMINGLY intricate at the start, but after half an hour this director was ONLY capable of PRETENDING to be interesting, because anybody who knows LOOPER knows it's masterfully photographed and acted, but COMPLETELY lacking in coherency, lacking in ANY kind of grit, gut, spark or punch. Basically all the movies this director makes are somehow messed up. It's gibberisch, mash patatoes, nice but you cant get your hands around it.The story: Agatha Christie detective story. (Another) intelligent, well acted, but TOO complicated who dunnit story about a murder.The good: the acting is great. Really. It's a bit too much, a bit OVER acted, but that is done for the comedy effect.The bad: it's a mess. It just does not mold together. It's going everywhere and nowhere simultaneously. It's simply put, TOO MANY PLOTLINES glued together, just for the sake of it. Wannabe smart writing. Wannabe smart direction.This movie is a WANNABE.",4,3,6,17 February 2020
The Secret in Their Eyes," Beautiful! Beautiful!
","Wonderfully subtle love story mixed into a suspenseful who dunnit story, intermingled with a few twinkling jokes. Beautiful! Beautiful!Why is this detective story so wonderfully touching and beautiful? I dont wanna reveal any spoilers, but let me say this, that the subtle, true to life way in which the director portrays the love a man can feel for a woman, touches my heart in a profound way. This movie is definitely NOT a sentimental romantic story, not at all. On the contrary, this movie is firstmost a suspenseful detective story about the hunt for a killer who raped an innocent young woman. The romantic part sneaks up on me as viewer quite unexpectedly, which makes it even more touching.Direction, photograpy, music score are all really excellent. I mean, there is a constant mood of silent sorrow, which encapsulates this picture. This wonderful melancholy mood is captured in the music and in the soft colors with which this story is being portrayed. This movie feels like a dear memory of a long gone summer holiday. This description might sound a bit vague, but what I am trying to express is that the director succeeded brilliantly in depicting a beautiful melancholy mood with the excellent use of the techniques of photography and music. Truly wonderful.The story AND the acting though are what truly make this picture rise out far above any other detective or romantic story. This story gripped me from the start, kept me guessing untill the very suspenseful end, which I wont reveal ofcourse. Acting is just oooohhh ! Simply marvellous and so very true to life and even quite funny at times! Simply BEAUTIFUL! Highly recommended.This is my 400th review. Thank you for reading!",9,1,1,16 March 2019
The Irishman," Netflix dictating how long a movie lasts, is definitely the nail in the coffin, which is the end of cinema as we know it. Farewell Scorsese, you have sold out to Netflix.
","The biggest crime in this movie was not an exciting gangster shootout, but simply the fact that this 3 hour 30 minute long movie was BORING. Please, never bore me with a gangster movie. A gangster movie should ALWAYS be the complete opposite of BORING.Because director Scorsese as well as de Niro and Pacino have made such brilliant classics in the past, I simply wont settle for a boring movie like this one. I demand / desire EXCELLENCE! But ALL I got was boring.Beware: this movie is hyped artificially on Imdb (watch out for the 10 star reviews). Never mind the fake reviews though, because my biggest disappointment is the fact that I suddenly realised that Netflix is now dictating the director on how long any movie should last. That's one of the reasons why this movie is so BORING. 3 hours and 29 minutes. What were they thinking? A director, and no one else, should decide how long/short a movie should last. Not a stock market company like Netflix, who has a certain timeslot of 3 hours and 29 minutes to fill up with CONTENT. BORING content...Opening scene of this movie: a long walk through a home for the elderly. That says it all. This movie hasnt got a beating heart. Every gangster looks old and tired in this movie. The special effects to make de Niro look younger are not natural looking and kind of silly.My hopes were really high for this movie. And now those hopes are crushed. Farewell Scorsese, de Niro and Pacino. You have changed American movie history, but now it is time to respectfully retire...",4,12,72,1 November 2019
The Fifth Element," Science fiction comedy which becomes tedious at points. Not very funny, but still quite entertaining. Great acting by Gary Oldman.
","This complicated story is way too long for a comedy. Half an hour could have easily been cut out of it, to improve the flow. The scifi story is bizarre and doesnt really matter, because it is just an excuse for Bruce Willis to save someone, to fight someone and to save someone again etc. Director Luc Besson has more often made movies with stories that just make no sense whatsoever, but you soon realise that when you start watching it. And because one knows it isnt meant to be taken seriously, one can just relax and go with the wild flow of this bizarre science fiction comedy in which Milla Jovovich is an alien that must save the earth from an attack. Bruce Willis is there to protect her. And the ever evil Gary Oldman is out to kill them both. Complicated yet dumb story, but the action and the jokes are good enough to get entertained. Kids would love it. Most adults could love it too if they are into Bruce Willis and have an affection for other weird movies of Luc Besson. His directing style is very wild and imaginative, but he achieves to make very enjoyable movies out of absurd stories. The fifth element isnt a very great comedy, but it is still very enjoyable, because director Luc Besson's style is so unique and playful.",7,0,0,27 July 2018
"I Love You, Man"," A comedy for Paul Rudd fans. Suited for anyone else? Ehhh... I dont know. It's an OK comedy, but geared towards guys and their hangups...
","It's an OK comedy, but nothing out of the ordinary, although the story about a GUY without any male friends is rather original.Could guys love it? Would girls love this comedy? Depends. If one likes Paul Rudd then this is simply another nobrainer comedy like we know of him. For anyone else it's ok-ish, but perhaps a bit slow and a bit lacking in punch.The good: the dialogues and the (akward) etiquette jokes.The story: Paul Rudd is getting married, but he hasnt got any male friends, which is a fact that starts to worry his fiancee, because men without male friends tend to become clingy husbands. Paul Rudd decides to start MAN DATING. Oh boy..",7,0,0,3 April 2020
Dead Poets Society," Still stands strong after 30 years. Classic drama with touching acting performances and warmhearted direction by Peter Weir.
","A wonderfully, touching uplifting portrait of teenagers coming of age, learning how to think for themselves and experiencing how to live LIFE to the FULLEST, inspired by an unconventional, loving English teacher played brilliantly by Robin Williams, which is one of his best roles of his entire career.Dramas dont come any better than this one. BUT it isnt a drama for the first hour, because it starts out as an uplifting, vivacious portrait of teenagers at a strict boarding school, where everybody is suffocated by RULES and more rules, UNTIL that special day teacher Robin Williams starts teaching.This movie can be seen by young and old, but I guess especially young people would really be impressed by it, because this movie, like no other, depicts with suffocating reality, the pressures kids can be burdened with when they have to OBEY their parents' will and wishes and when their own creativity and passions are stifled with ruthless restrictions and punishments by their parents and their 'teachers'...Right now I still have goosebumps merely thinking about this movie. It's so profoundly, impressive and touching and uplifting. One of the best dramas ever! Yes, EVER!",9,2,2,18 June 2020
Deadpool 2," Deadpool 2 is a great sequel, suited for adults as well. The same hilarious and riveting action as in Deadpool 1, but with more credible characters and better oneliners.
","A suicidal superhero comes to the rescue of a fat superhero kid who has got no friends. Will they live happily ever after? I didnt really like Deadpool 1, but I did like this sequel, because the jokes are better and thankfully there are some breathers in between the action scenes, so adults, who value characters and a good story, will be able to appreciate this movie as well.Deadpool 1 had a too fastpaced tempo, which destroyed the fabric of the movie. Deadpool 1 was more of a longwinding gimmick, this time around though the characters and the story can be enjoyed though in a normal pace, which makes for a lot more pleasurable watching experience. The action is still fantastic, but even the action is more enjoyable, because it isnt non stop as it was in Deadpool 1. A pause now and then, with some hilarious sentimental scenes between the characters, greatly enhances the fun for me of watching these sort of bizarre action comedies, which are usually only made for teenagers, but as I said before this movie can be enjoyed by adults as well.Watch out for some great short cameos by Brad Pitt and Matt Damon. And there is some great seventies and eighties music to be heard by: Dolly Parton, AC/DC, Enya, Barbara Streisand and lots of others, whose music is truly hilarious in the context of this bizarre superhero story.",8,2,2,29 May 2019

","Jim Carey is stuck in a boring bankjob. His girlfriend has left him. His friends bore him. He has become a couch potatoe. But suddenly an old friend convinces him to go see a positivity guru, who forces him to say YES to any opportunity which happens upon him. From then on things start spiralling out of control in a amusing and miraculously positive way. Will the good times last?Just good fun. Fortunately this movie is not completely ridiculous, like some of his farcical 'animal' movies, but this is rather a silly romantic comedy, with a lovely, funny role by Zooey Deschanel, who wasnt known well back then. Love to watch a Jim Carey movie, when I wanna have some mindless fun. Seen it many times already and this story is charming enough to be enjoyed by the whole family.",7,0,0,16 April 2019
A Bridge Too Far," Record breaking war movie. True story about the invasion of Holland, which was bigger in size than D-day in France. Featuring a staggering 14 oscar winners.
","Record breaking war movie, in sheer size of the production. Biggest production ever in movie history. 'A Bridge Too Far' tells the true story about the invasion of Holland during WW II, which was bigger in size than D-day in France and which caused more casualties.Greatest cast of movie stars ever ensembled in any movie in the entire seventies, featuring an incredible number of 14 oscar winners: Sean Connery, Robert Redford, Gene Hackman, Michael Caine, Laurence Olivier, James Caan, Anthony Hopkins, Dirk Bogarde, Liv Ullman etc. Acting performances are excellent. How could it have been otherwise, with such an unique cast of movie stars from the seventies. Everybody who was famous at the time played in it. Steve McQueen was the only star that refused to take part, because he wanted a bigger paycheck. Since this huge war movie production was already crumbling under a huge financial burden, Steve McQueen's paycheck demands were rejected.This war movie became the biggest grossing box office hit in Europe, but it didnt do well in America. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, but the film was completely ignored at Oscar time for daring to expose the fatal inadequacies of the Allied campaign.Almost 3 hours long, but enticing from beginning to end. Never bored me for a minute. On the contrary, even though I have seen this movie dozens of times I still get excited by it. Young people however may find it a bit long drawn at moments, because there arent lots of funny 'Star Wars' like explosions every 10 minutes.Beware: there isnt a happy ending. Director Richard Attenborough made a movie that is enjoyable for the entire family, BUT he also clearly stated that he didnt want to make a movie that glorified the war. The ending of 'A Bridge Too Far' is a big downer. You wont feel cheery at the end at all. Therefore lots of people WONT like the ending and downrate this movie on Imdb because of it. The ending (last half hour) is true to life though, because everything is being portrayed as has happened during World War II. War aint fun, but this movie is still very glorious, uplifting and even quite funny at some other moments. Really suspenseful too, even though I already know exactly how everything will play out.Endnote: there is an excellent additional bonus DVD which features hours of real life war footage from World War II including a short documentary about the making of this biggest war movie of all time. The production of this movie was truly insane. But so is war...",9,1,2,20 June 2018
Zodiac," This movie crept under my skin and stayed there... May look like a simple who dunnit story, but this David Fincher classic is truly riveting!
","Zodiac is a movie based on a true seventies story about the hunt for a serial killer. The true grit of this movie comes from the portraits of normal everyday people who are just losing it, bit by bit, while searching for clues who this mysterious serial killer could be.The suspense isnt found in violence being comitted but in violence being left in the shadows.It is always spookier when you dont know who is attacking you as is the case in this riveting movie that is based on a true story, depicted in several books by author Robert Graysmith.Director David Fincher (Seven) made a movie that creeps under my skin, but does so very slowly, clocking 2 and a half hours, without getting boring for a second. On the contrary, this movie keeps getting more and more intense towards the end.Besides the suspense there are simultaneously lots of really funny scenes in which the characters of Jake Gylenhaal and Robert Downey Jr, easily win you over with their unfortunate sink or swim charm. Well over 2 and a half hours long, this movie feels like it could have been even longer with still masses of suspense around each new plot turn.This movie gives me goosebumps writing about it, because it is performed, photographed, scored, and directed with such excellence that it can be watched over and over again and the suspense (and the jokes) are still as powerful as they were the first time around. Endnote for fans of music: the subtle and gorgeous soundtrack enhances this feeling of being lost in a supenseful maze with no end. Highly recommended for every fan of detectives, because they dont get any better than this...",10,0,0,21 February 2018
The Terminator," This somewhat cheap looking ACTION movie became an unexpected action classic. Didnt age too well, but the adrenaline fueled ACTION is still top notch!
","I was astonished when I read how cheap this movie had to be made, back in the eighties; only 6 million dollars were available! There simply was no money at all ! And it only made 40 million at the box office. Terminator became much more popular though later on by repeated tv airings and video and dvd releases.Arnold Schwarzenegger wasnt yet a household name back then, he was merely a B-movie actor with muscles. Everything changed for the better with this movie. Terminator launched Arnie's carreer and rightfully so, because he portrayed the ultimate killing machine in a way that is still nervewrecking and fun to watch to this very day.Despite the cheap looking (sciencefiction) sets and some cheap looking special effects, there is something truly maniacal AND exciting about this action movie. A killing machine from the future (Arnold Schwarzenegger) has come to earth to kill an innocent woman. Why? And can he be stopped? This story is as ludicrous as can be, but the execution of the ACTION is fascinating nonetheless, because of the relentless killing spree, with contineous riveting action scenes upon action scenes. One big long adrenaline fueled ACTION party! The action photography is excellent!Terminator 2 is considered to be better by many and it is, because this original has got some quite corny and cheap moments, which are fortunately absent in the sequel. Terminator 2 does look way much better and has got a more credible portrayal of the characters. Only the terrific action in this original Terminator made me watch it though, because besides the action, the rest of the story is rather corny, cheap looking and outdated.Watch them both would be my advice, starting with the original, so things will get MUCH better when you start watching the sequel next.",5,3,7,15 June 2019
The Hateful Eight," First time ever I got really bored watching a Tarantino picture. It was meant to be a theatre play and somehow it lacks punch when it was turned into a movie.
","Somehow this Tarantino flick got me bored. And that is really the first time EVER that I got bored at a Tarantino movie. The masses seemed to love it though. The worse Tarantino's pictures seem to get, the more tickets he is selling at the box office. The average western fan will probably like this western anyway, because it does press all the right buttons that need to be pressed to please the audiences that like westerns. For a diehard Tarantino fan like me however, this movie is his worst ever.Tarantino often has said he will only make 10 movies in his entire carreer. This was nr. 8. After nr. 10 he promised that he will retire and start making theatre plays only. I do think Tarantino has got the talent to make another brilliant movie, but if not I hope he will stick to his own promise and retire pretty soon.The Hateful Eight originally was meant to be a theatre play and it would have fared better if it had indeed become a theatre play, because the dialogues are more suitable for a theatre than for a movie. The dialogues and scenes are incredibly long drawn and slow, without much change of scenery. Somehow these theatre play dialogues feel unsuited to be transformed to a movie format. For the first time ever I got bored at a Tarantino movie! Not a great record.Fortunately Tarantino will return to the gangster genre with his next movie. I am in dire need of another good Tarantino movie after this slowburning boring theatreplay mess...",4,1,3,20 March 2019
"I, Tonya"," Tonya stole my heart. She wanted to be loved, but got beaten up by everybody, including the media. Best TRUE story I have seen in years. Magnificent!
","What an incredible true story! Really amazing. For those unknown with the history of Tonay Harding: she was accused of hiring a hitman to crush the knees of her competitor at the olympics for ice skating.Excellent performance by all the actors involved. I mean really EVERYBODY acts amazingly hilarious, but they do it so seriously that they really seem true to life. It is without a doubt the best performance by Margot Robbie of her entire carreer, playing a white trash redneck girl who gets beaten up by her mom, then gets beaten up by her husband, then gets beaten up by the media and justice for having dumb than dumber friends who ruined everything she loved: ice skating.This movies trailer is way more aggresive than the actual movie. The trailer of 'I, Tonya' almost depicts her as a loudmouthed b*tch, who will kill to achieve succes. But the actual movie is much more nuanced and really endearing and supportive of Tonya in the end. In essence the story is all about a little girl wanting to be loved. And the only love she ever had was ice skating. That was what her mother forced her to do, cussing at this little innocent kid, hitting this little young kid with only one goal: to achieve succes in ice skating. That is just heartbreaking to see.Yes despite all the heartbreaking misery it is still a great comedy. The truly magnificent acting by all the actors, but especially by Margot Robbie, makes this tragic comedy become way more powerful than I expected it to be . Very pleasantly surprised by it. Touched me on a level few comedies ever have achieved before. Very impressed. Started googling interviews with the real Tonya Harding on youtube afterwards.What an incredible true story...",9,1,1,22 July 2018
Molly's Game," I adore Jessica Chastain, but this is bland formula stuff, unworthy of her terrific acting skills. Maybe enjoyable for pokerfans, everybody else beware!
","I loved these actors in previous films, I am especially fond of Jessica Chastain, her name was the reason I choose to see this picture. The fact that this movie got a ridiculous 7.5 rating is why I write this review, to hopefully deflate the hype somewhat, because this is barely worthy 5 stars, at best. Perhaps pokerfans could stand to watch it to the bitter end, but if you truly love movies for true to life acting performances and/or real life dialogues, you will be disappointed, because this is just another bland formula movie.Everything just feels unnatural. And that matters, because this is suppose to be a true to life portrait of a sidekick, who earned big bucks organizing high roller poker games. Based on a true story, which is indeed rather interesting, but all the dialogues feel rushed, superficially speeded up to probably please the teenage popcorn loving masses who cant stand a second of natural silence in a dialogue. I can clearly sense the manager's influence in this movie, who desperatedly want to sell it to a young teenage audience and decide to speed the dialogues up. Because speed sells. Wrong thinking.Watch 'Rounders' with Matt Damon and Edward Norton and John Malkovich. THAT is a truly great film about poker. Molly's game is just fluff, only produced to cash in on the poker game hype. Such a waste of actor's talent.",3,3,10,13 February 2019
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Humorous depiction of the end of the western era. These were the last 2 real western cowboys, but they had fun while it lasted.
","A word of warning for those who might expect a standard western. It is not. It is deliberatedly made to confuse you a bit, to do things differently. Some wont be pleased by that, because they long for a straight western story. It is not. It definitely has got a sixties feel to it, in which period a lot of experimenting was done. The 2 robbers arent fearless for instance. One of them hasnt even ever killed a man. That's unheard of in a standard western, where men are always butch. His name is butch cassidy, but he isnt really butch at all. These subtle tongue in cheek gests at the western genre, wont get picked up by the more casual viewer, who might easily think it is neither fish or flesh and even somewhat boring, because of the pace of the movie. I think this movie can best be judged as a mild parody of the standard western genre. The story is about 2 legendary bankrobbers who are being chased down to the south, after they became too greedy. Some good jokes, some nice action. Just a delight to watch.Special note for the cinephiles: The photography by Conrad L Hill needs to be especially praised, because it features some of the most stunning vistas of deserts ever recorded on the silver screen, a quality you would not expect to see in a comedy western. When you look at the resume of this photographer you will understand that this man is a grandmaster in his line of work. He has filmed impressive classics like 'The Marathon Man', 'Fat City', 'Cool Hand Luke' and modern classics like 'American Beauty' and 'Road to Perdition'. I dare say that this photographer stands among the greatest photographers of american movie history.",8,1,1,21 September 2018
Ocean's Twelve," Too disjointed story structure. Tried to be too smart. Never equalled the brilliant smoothness of the terrific original.
","They tried to make a great sequel and they failed. BUT nevertheless it is still a mildly enjoyable heist movie, despite being less good than the original Ocean's Eleven, which was absolutely brilliant.The bad: too disjointed story structure. The story basically is a mess and almost incomprehensible and silly near the end. There are simply too many loose scenes that dont add anything to the story. There are 2 villains now instead of one. There are 2 romances now instead of 1. There are 2 heists now instead of 1. Double cross upon double cross. They multiplied everything, they added things and added even more things on top of that, but that made the story only more chaotic and less coherent. What a mess...The good: judged by each of the scenes individually, they are often still funny and well acted by terrific actors. I mean, what a dream cast of stars! Lots of good tongue in cheek jokes. Seductive female powerplay with Catherine Zeta Jones added to the mix, next to Julia Roberts.I would still NOT recommend it to anyone, unless you wanna pass the time and you have nothing better to watch...Simply REwatch the original, because the original is heavenly, this movie though is only a failed copycat...",7,1,2,10 February 2020
Snatch," Style reigns over content. Still an enjoyable watch, if you dont expect more than a good B movie..
","Seen it multiple times now and I really think that 'Snatch' tries too hard to be funny and cool. It is the british wannabe brother of Tarantino. It does make for an enjoyable watch though, but the style over content attitude becomes tideous at some point. Still it is funny at times. A lot of action, you wont get bored. And there is some good acting by Brad Pitt amongst others. A diamant gets stolen. And stolen again. And again. That's the story. Next to that there is another 'storyline' in which Brad Pitt needs to go down in a boxingmatch in the 4th round to please some gangsta boss. But he wont go down. And he wont go down again. A lot of chases, threats and shootouts is what follows.The speed of 'Snatch' is suited for kids wiht ADHD. The cussing is suited for whoever likes it. It looks like a trailer for a movie instead of being a movie itself because the speed of this thing is so fast that it becomes boring at times. As I said I have watched it multiple times already, so there is definitely something that is enticing, but there is something lacking also. Good B movie, for those who prefer style over content. And there is definitely a market for that. Me being one of those people, because sometimes I just like to see a mindnumbing action movie. When I watch it with that attitude in mind, 'Snatch' is rather enjoyable...",7,0,1,15 May 2018
BlacKkKlansman," Lighthearted story about racism in the seventies, portraying the story of 2 cops who went undercover in a racist organisation. Good acting performances.
","Generally speaking a lighthearted story about racism, with lots of tongue in cheek jokes and a few dark and cruel racist scenes as well. The story is based on real events about 2 cops, one white, one black, who went undercover in a racist organisation in the seventies. Did they succeed in bringing racists to justice by going undercover? That is the cliffhanger of this story.Direction is ok, acting as well and the story is quite interesting because it was based on real events that happened in the seventies. Any bad? Well, not really, only 1 thing at the very end. What took me off guard is what happened at the end (last 10 minutes) of this movie. It hammered down a political correct message from politics from today by showing some explicit violent REAL LIFE news footage about race riots. Why does Spike Lee do that? His message at the end is superfluous in my opinion and only substracts from the powerful fictional story that has already just been told about racism in the seventies.This weird choice to start mixing real life news footage from today in a fictional movie really is in bad taste in my opinion. Never seen it done before in this blunt way. Make a fictional movie OR make a documentary. Make a choice. Really downer ending in an otherwise decent picture about racism in the seventies.",7,2,5,19 April 2019
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," 'Gentlemen, you can't fight in here, this is the war room!' Silly movie, with a serious message.
","Slowburning, satyrical nuclear war comedy about an american general who goes bananas and starts a nuclear attack on his own.The bad:
This movie is dated. And it shows: the special effects give me headaches, because they are so clumsily done. And there are lots of those clumsy effects. But it is a comedy, so who cares? Most of the jokes are completely silly, which sometimes irritates me a bit. But hey, it is a comedy, so who cares if it is completely silly now and then. The speed of this story might be way to slow for some viewers, but acting is really great and hilarious, so that evens things out a lot, for me personally.The good:
Despite all of these minor flaws that are mentioned above, 'Dr Strangelove' is still an impressive movie about the total madness of nuclear war. However silly this comedy might be, it has got a serious message for all us viewers: a nuclear war will mean the end of all of us. There are no winners, only losers in a nuclear war, however hard some try to convince us folks of the opposite. This movie is about all those people who think that nuclear war can be good IF we strike first. Because IF WE DON'T have nuclear powers, THEY will have them. These twisted paranoid ideas could mean the end of the world as we know it and director Stanley Kubrick made a great classic comedy about it.When watching this classic movie, one must not forget that the director made this movie in an era in which the americans came close to nuclear war with the russians during the 'bay of pigs' conflict in Cuba during the sixties. However silly this movie might be, it has got a very serious message about the dangers of nuclear power. THAT particular message is what makes 'Dr. Strangelove' a timeless classic.",9,9,13,15 December 2018
The Bodyguard," Fairytale story with a great performance by the late Whitney Houston, when she was sailing the highest succeses of her carreer.
","A famous singer gets stalked. A bodyguard has to protect her life. Romance blosssoms.A bit long. A bit too much sugarcoated and fairytale like, but still rather enjoyable. This movie was a big hit in the nineties, with both Kevin Cosner and Whitney Houston being the most popular actor and female singer. It is still an enjoyable movie to this day, with decent acting performances and a reasonably suspenseful story. Especially recommended for all those girls who dream of living the life of a popstar.",7,0,0,29 May 2019
The Beach," Starts out interesting, but half way through simply implodes as a mediocre plot about teenagers on holiday...
","The music is great. The scenery is gorgeous and beautifully photographed. Actors are good. What's not to like? Even the story (however flimsy) starts out interesting, although it is a childish story, this story about a SECRET island with a paradise like beach and enough free marihuana for everyone, is a teenager's fantasy: partying, drinking, smoking and having sex. What more could a teenager dream of? This start (first 45 minutes) of the movie is actually fun to watch, because it is credible, however airheaded these teenagers are.The bad: but then after 45 minutes the teenagers have found that particular paradise island, they have partied all night long and now what? Now enter some ridiculous plot turns that are quite laughable. I knew something was wrong with this picture, but I had forgotten it and it is the second part of the movie. Well, take a chance of watching it if you are a Leonardo di Caprio fan you might like it if you are a teenager and dreaming of your first holiday ....",5,0,1,5 June 2020
The Flowers of War," War is hell...
","This is NOT an action war movie whatsoever. Not meant to be enjoyable. It's bleak and sad. This is a subtle, yet intense portrait of the pain and courage humans show when they are at risk of dying.This haunting and devastating Chinese world war 2 story is shocking, portraying all the lowest of the lowest evils humans are capable of. War is hell. War makes humans desperate for survival by any means possible and survival of a group of orphan children at a church is what this story is all about. Christian Bale accidentally becomes the saviour of these vulnerable children at the church. Will he be able to protect them from harm from the raging war?Shocking, yet also very touching and inspiring tale about evil and love in desperate times of war.",8,0,0,8 January 2020
Begin Again," Feel good portrait of a debuting singer/songwriter. Terrific music score. Great acting by Keira Knightly and Marc Ruffalo.
","Makes me feel good watching AND listening to this movie, because the story is so uplifting AND the soundtrack is just terrific.The story is about Keira Knightly struggling as an unknown singer/songwriter, who didnt even realize she has got talent, untill a famous (has been) producer (Mark Ruffalo) discovers her extra oridinary singer/songwriter skills. This story is what every young artist dreams of. In between a heart gets broken and mended again, so there is a bit of budding romance as well. Yes, this story might sound a bit corny, but it is portrayed in such a gentle, endearing and uplifting way, that your heart must be of stone when you wont get moved by it. A crowd pleaser, of the best kind...The end credits mention special thanks to Bono and everyone at the factory in Dublin, which is the home base for most of the U2 recordings.Although neither Bono nor U2 does appear in this movie. The son of Marc Ruffalo, called Keen, does appear in a small cameo role as one of the 4 streetkids who are asking for 5 dollars and a cigarette in return for their silence during a recording in an alley where they were playing.",8,0,0,11 December 2018
Alien," Alien is the ultimate scifi classic with breathtaking photography, mesmirising sound, shocking special effects, riveting suspense and true to life acting. I am truly in awe!
","You have chosen wisely, because you are about to see Alien.
Merely 6 actors star in it, in total. There are no supporting actors, besides one cat called Jonesey. It costed only 11 million dollars to make, but it became the most intense and suspenseful worldwide thriller of 1979 and has since then been claimed to be one of the ultimate scifi pictures ever made.The story: a spaceship crew lands on a mysterious planet, where they get into contact with an alien life form. What follows is the most frightening, exhilarating downfall of an entire spaceship crew ever recorded in scifi history.I cant think of many other movies in which the fear for what one cant see is so suspenseful as it is in Alien. And Ridley Scott perfected this slowburning, yet riveting suspense style to the ultimate T. Director Ridley Scott has chosen to hide the monster from view most of the time. Not seeing the monster (most of the time) is definitely scarier than seeing it, although the special effects department created one truly horrifying monster as well. Brilliant, truly brilliant suspense!Alien still stands strong after 40 years. Acting, story, soundtrack, special effects and photography are still all truly magnificent! What a terrific thrill to watch this scifi masterpiece again!",10,1,2,23 August 2019
The Town," Some flaws in credibility of the romantic story in this movie. But the heist part of this movie is tough and suspenseful. Sum total is entertaining.
","The story is about a town called Charlestown which is famous for being the birthplace of the largest number of robbers in the entire USA. This place spawns criminals like crazy. Ben Affleck is one of them, although he is the gentleman gangster, never killed someone, only has robbed some banks. The latest heist goes awry however and a guard is shot down. The police goes beserk and does everything in its power to apprehend the criminals at large. Will Ben Affleck succeed in pulling off the biggest heist without getting busted?Movies got to be sold to the masses and I cant think of another reason that in most heist movies there always has to be a romantic story in order to lure the female audiences into buying a ticket. Can't image any guy wanting to see a romance in a tough heist movie. I dont have anything against romances, not even in heist movies, as long as the romantic story is credible. And it was NOT.The somewhat flawed romantic story is about Ben Affleck, playing a bankrobber, who starts flirting with a female bankmanager of the place that he just robbed. That's just a lot of Hollywood romantic crap. The writer only puts something THIS much unbelievable in the story to sell tickets for females, who wanna drool over Ben Affleck. Females wont mind, guys probably will get anoyed by it somewhat.The rest of this movie is good though. Very good. The heist part of this movie is really tough and suspenseful. Coming close in true to life portrayal of gangster life in classics like 'Heat' with Robert de Niro and Al Pacino and 'Training Day', with Denzel Washington. These realistic supsenseful heist action scenes are what make this movie standout above the average heist movie. Acting in it is very very good. From leading characters (Ben Affleck, Jeremy Renner) to some of the supporting actors, acting is on a level that really made me believe in the gangsters world that was portrayed in 'The Town'.Sum total of this movie is pretty impressive, despite some flaws in the romantic story. If you just wanna see an entertaining action movie, then this hollywood formula film will certainly entertain. And there are some nice twists near the end that make this story surprising and very suspenseful. Too bad about the flawed romantic story, because the rest of this heist movie is really great.",8,0,1,7 July 2018
Taxi Driver," Slowburning portrait of a man who turns to violence to release his inner deamons.
","A cabdriver who feels lost and alienated in the big city, looses his mind and turns to violence to 'solve' his perceived problems.Slowburning start, yet constantly increasing in claustrophobic insanity. For all those who never seen it, my advice would be to give it some time. 'Taxi Driver' is not made for the impatient. It is NOT an action movie. It is a disturbing movie about a man's mental downfall. It is NOT fun to watch, brilliantly disturbing nonetheless.Director Martin Scorsese got ignored by the Oscars for decades on end. Though recently Scorsese got a standing ovation at the Oscars that lasted longer than any other because of the enormous gratitude and admiration amongst his collegue directors and actors. But way back in the seventies Martin Scorsere was a young and upcoming talent and 'Taxi Driver' got ignored at the Oscars, although Robert de Niro did get a nomination, which he didnt win.'Taxi Driver' was only recognized for it's true significance by ALL the critics many years later. A lot of mixed reviews upon first release though. Some hailed it as a masterpiece (Cannes Jury Prize), others considered it utter garbage. Mostly the violence was mentioned as off putting by the critics. That's strange, because there is not a lot of violence in it, but when 'Taxi Driver' had just been released in 1976 it got a bad rep for it's violence anyway. The (only very small part of) violence is purposeful and crucial to the story. It aint violence for the sake of it. The portrayed violence is the climax of a story about alienation in which the leading character sees no other solution for his problems then starting a killing spree. Lots of analyses about the reasons why this man turns to violence are on the tip of my tongue, but you better judge for your self why you think violence is portrayed the way that it is in this movie. Lots of different opinions here on Imdb.Legendary movie composer Bernard Herrmann (famous from his Alfred Hitchock scores) who wrote the soundtrack is memorated at the endcredits, because he passed away after the making of 'Taxi Driver'. His soundtrack could truly be labeled as another leading role, because of the powerful impact it has got. The soundtrack mixes in with the voice over of Robert de Niro, who describes the filth of New York, while the jazzy tunes surround him during his nightshift as a taxidriver. This soundtrack is seductive and smooth at one time, yet pounding dark and eery sounding at other moments.I think Herrmanns soundtrack together with the photography of another movie legend Michael Chapman gives us viewers one of the most impressive raunchy backdrops of New York City life ever recorded in the seventies. You can feel and smell the filth of the streets through their music and filming. Michael Chapman's use of the camera is extremely intuitive and acts as a fly on the wall, heightening the true to life depiction of Robert de Niro's alienation in New York City. Some of his shots are so extra ordinary and playful that they take me by surprise every time I see them. Just gorgeous alienating dreamlike shots that seem to float over the scene, instead of directly capturing it. You just gotta see it yourself, to experience the dark beauty of it. Because dark, yet beautiful it is!",10,0,0,1 April 2018

All the good dialogues are gone and there are no good jokes to be enjoyed as well. As always it lasts way too long. Why do they do that? I get bored after an hour and a half. Why make it last over 2 hours?This is the blond edition of Captain America, in which the hairdo of Captain America is most important and not what comes out of his mouth.",5,0,3,31 March 2020
Ocean's Thirteen," 13 is the lucky number.
","Oceans twelve was unlucky as a sequel. Ocean's thirteen however is right on the spot and a succesfull sequel. 13 is an almost exact copy of the original Ocean's Eleven, but who cares, it works splendidly. And in 13 the feel good factor is back which was lacking in 12. And although there are smart twists in 13 they are not that complicated that you cant understand them as was the case in Oceans twelve.No romances this time. However I did like Julia Roberts and Cahterina Zeta Jones in 11 and 12, I didnt miss the girls in 13. More room for Al Pacino who played the egoistic asshole to a T.It is a formula film, but great formulas can deliver great enjoyable movies, as is the case with Ocean's 13. You know what you are gonna get. You liked it before and you will like it now. Ofcourse the surprise effect is less great than with the first Ocean's Eleven. I give Ocean's 13 a well deserved 7 points, which may turn into 8 points if I start to appreciate this movie even more during the coming years as did happen with the magnificent Ocean's Eleven which I must have seen a dozen times...",7,0,0,26 March 2018
Full Metal Jacket," Brilliant first half, mediocre second half. Still an impressive movie, that made me sick to my stumach, in a 'good' way...
","The FIRST PART:
featuring the military training of new American soldiers destined for Vietnam is gripping, sickening, real and basically sums up the whole destructive power of war, while the soldiers havent even left America.The intense drilling and dehumanizing of the soldiers during training in America is being portrayed with such chilling excellence, that it even gives a better understanding of the destructiveness of warfare, than showing real combat on the battlefield. It would have sufficed had director Kubrick only made an entire movie about nothing else but the training of soldiers in America. Unfortunately he didnt. This movie breaks in half in 2 parts.The SECOND PART:
Kubrick is NOT an action director. He is a subtle, intelligent director for whom dialogue and character interaction are most important. The first part had all these qualities of true to life dialogue and great character interaction. In the second part however, trying to portray characters interact with each other during action combat scenes looks out of place at times. The photography and the film set (London) didnt look convincing at moments either, which detracts from the credibility of the combat scenes. The acting performances were a bit off as well in the second part, although it does end with a magnificent, yet sickening climax. Sickening in an impressive true to life kind of way, portraying the real horrors of war...Despite the flawed second part it is still a very impressive movie, which I would recommend, because it trashes any beliefs that war is a glorious battle. Full Metal Jacket shows detailed personal suffering, until it makes me 'sick'. That 'sick' feeling is Full Metal Jacket's best characteristic...because war is personal hell, multiplied by millions...",8,0,1,29 September 2019
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," NOT true to life. So very much NOT true to life that this story becomes ridiculous.
","This is suppose to be a drama. Drama needs a credible story. It hasnt got one. It is just a continous cop bashing story with no credibility in the story whatsoever. Only if the leading character would have been a terrorist or a psychotic serial killer this story would have rung true. But all these crimes (firebombing the police office) are done by a rational and intelligent middle aged mother who runs a souvenir shop. Has anyone EVER seen a mother firebomb a policestation, because the cops didnt solve the murder of her daughter? More of this kind of nonsense though is what you can expect in '3 billboards'.I suspect there must have been a (politically correct) reason why this ludicrous silly movie got so many awards, in America only. Maybe American people are so fed up with police brutality that they will praise any picture, in which roles are reversed and cops get terrorized for a change, instead of black and gay people. Literal quote from the movie indicating this cop bashing theme: 'if you got rid of all the cops with vaguely racist leanings, you'd have only have three cops left. And all of them would hate fags.'However interesting reversing stereotypical roles may sound, (even in relation to police brutality), any drama still needs a credible story. And credibility is lacking big time in this silly picture, because of the ridiculous behaviour by the leading character who plays a firebombing mom (Frances McDormand). One just cant take her seriously halfway through the movie anymore. Her anger maybe true to life. For sure. Her complaints may be justified. But her actions just are ridiculous and make a laughing stock of this movie. An intelligent mom who is firebombing a police station and then they expect to be taken seriously? Who are they kiddin'?Or is all this sillyness suppose to be funny? It isnt a black comedy either to me. Or is it? Then I must have forgotten to laugh a single time...",3,3,8,30 December 2018

American Hustle," Brilliant story and dialogue. Hilarious acting performances. Cutting edge editing based on a swooping soundtrack. Dynamic and playful photography. Brilliant!. I love it!!!
","Man oh man,this must be one of the most hilarious con stories. I truly applaud the writers, who based this terrific plot on real events. During the opening scenes of this movie one can read a statement saying: 'Some of this actually happened'. And it did. Christian Bale's character was loosely based on Melvin Weinberg, an international con artist and informant, and his girlfriend Evelyn Knight, who both helped plan and conduct a FBI sting operation. These 2 con artists were both facing a prison sentence at the time (the seventies) and in exchange for their help, the FBI agreed to let them out on probation.The plot is genius, but wait until you hear the dialogues! These dialogues are what makes American Hustle such a hilarious thrill to listen to over and over again, because rarely ever before have I heard such absurd, hilarious, yet still true to life dialogues, that are just to die for. One line after the other is just sheer joy to listen to.I must applaud the acting as well. How could I not applaud that! Robert de Niro has a very small ghost part in this movie. One of his most perfect and creepy roles ever! But no credits at the endtitles for his performance! NONE. They sneaked De Niro in...and he is scary as hell. Christian Bale, Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence reach the stars with their performances which are so incredibly funny, but still so believable and adorable at the same time. Director David O Russel proves with this movie again that he definitely is the new born director star of the new American cineman. After 'The Fighter' and 'Silver Lining Playbook' he hits the jackpot again with 'American Hustle' in which Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper both star again.Everything is perfect in this movie. Everything. American Hustle has won dozens of awards around the world, won golden globes and got 10 oscar nominations. I have seen this flick now a dozen times or so and I still enjoy it as much as the first time. American Hustle is truly up there with the modern classics. It is a feast for the eye, because of the hilarious, yet serious acting performances, portrayed onto the silver screen with mesmirising photography and cutting edge editing, based on a fantastic seventies soundtrack. The story is simply to die for. Genius. And you wont stop laughing. I am in movie heaven. Sheer Brilliance !",10,0,1,6 March 2018
The Godfather: Part II," The original Godfather is like Spring. Watching The Godfather part 2 is like entering a never ending Winter. Part 2 is as powerful and as mesmirising, yet so saddening
","2 word advice: Watch it. Just watch it. Watch the restored 4K version if you can, the picture quality is breathtakingly gorgeous. This isnt a review by the way, it's just a long tribute to the brilliance of this work.For once a sequel is as powerful as the original. The Godfather part 2 is the proof. It is more elobarate, with a more detailed, complicated story, compared to the original. It has more character devellopment than part 1. Yet it definitely has a more saddening, melancholic mood as well. The original Godfather is like watching Spring, watching The Godfather part 2 however is like entering a never ending Winter. Part 2 is as powerful, as mesmirising and as brilliant as the original, but so saddening to watch. Sad, but beautiful.Director Francis Ford Coppola pulled of something no other director has ever achieved. He created 2 masterpieces of American cinema back to back, within 2 years. Coppola was a mad man in the seventies. Bordering on lunacy and also bordering on bankruptcy. Although one would think the enormous succes of the original Godfather made him a millionaire, he risked all his money for the sequel. That risk of investing all of his own money gave him a lot of creative control though, with consequentially terrific results.Just to mention one example in which director Coppola took risks no other director would dare take, I want to tell you about the Robert de Niro scenes shot in New York. The studio wanted to shoot these streetscenes on a cheaper indoor filmset, but director Coppola insisted he wanted to shoot on the streets of New York.This was not just a regular shoot, no way. Coppola cordoned off two entire city blocks for weeks on end. He redesigned the entire 2 blocks to make them look exactly like pre-war conditions. New Yorkers being New Yorkers were complaining about the inability to enter their own houses for weeks on end. The costs that cordoning off entire city blocks costed were skyrocketing. And for what purpose? Coppola wanted an authentic looking scene of merely a couple a minutes in which Robert de Niro would walk the streets of his neighbourhood.These scenes do look stunning, and because I know how many millions these few scenes have costed, I cant help but admire Coppola even more then I already did, for wanting to go to the limit in order to achieve ultimate credibility. And THAT is what the Godfather oozes in massive amounts: CREDIBILITY. Never before or after have life and love and the bonds of family been portrayed with such cinematic craftmanship and soul.Originally released in 1974. It was brilliant, mesmirising and taking my breath away back then. It still does, to this very day...",10,2,2,7 April 2019
Fargo," This is a true story. Bizarre yet hilarious. Funny yet dramatic.
","This is a true story. No kiddin. It really is. It seems so bizarre and comical, but it is truly based on real events, only the names of the characters are changed. Fargo is about a financially struggling loser played by William H. Macey. His car business is going downhill and he is desperate for extra money. This dude comes up with the idea to fake a kidnapping of his own wife and collect the ransom monye which will be paid by the extremely wealthy father of his wife. Things go sour of course. And how terribly bad things get is the brilliance of this true story. The reason you must be reading this review is because you probably dont know the Coen Brothers (very well). Any fan of their work will watch everything they make, because these 2 brothers are the pinacle of absolute genius in american independent cinema. I just count the months every year waiting to see the next creation of these brothers who are both director, producer and writer of all their movies. With 'Fargo' they made one of their best works. It became one their most popular ones too, even a series was made after this story.For those who have never seen a Coen Brothers film before, a little warning: the humor in 'Fargo' is very subtle. The Coen Brothers are magnificent in portraying their characters in a way that can be interpreted in different ways. You can look at it as a drama, but simultaneously you can also laugh about it. These brothers walk this tightrope between comedy and drama as a brilliant circus trapeze act. It makes for an unforgettable watching experience. But some people just dont understand these black comedies. The Coen Brothers style is NOT straight comedy. It is twisted and dark, but true to life and endearing simultaneously.Acting performances are always great in all of the Coen Brothers movies. Just like in Quentin Tarantino's movies, these twin brother directors truly love and appreciate their actors. Excellent casting choices!Huge praise for the beautiful soundtrack by Carter Burwell and for the beautifully shot desolate winter spaces of Dakota by oscar nominated photographer Roger Deakins.Fargo has become a Coen Brother's favorite of mine. Not their best work, so if you like this one, please check out their earliest work and the classic 'No Country for Old Men', those are all ultimate masterpieces of modern american cinema!",9,0,1,29 June 2018

","Seen it a second time now and when the story is known there is not much else to be enjoyed, because the acting performance by Chris Hemsworth is average (at best) and there is lots of girlfriend stuff going on all the time, which is simply a major distraction from the racing car story about Niki Lauda.This simply should have been a Niki Lauda movie, for 100%. Who cares about James Hunt? He is a nobody. Niki Lauda made history and will be remembered. Hunt wont be and neither will his girlfriends, who got a ridiculous amount of screentime in this movie.Any good?

Or will the powers that be cripple Leonardo di Caprio's attempt of becoming the biggest aviation company in history?This is a story about how to achieve the American Dream at all costs. True story by the way, based on billionaire Howard Hughes. Just google that name, quite extra oridinary story. What makes this epic story unique is the portrayal of all the psychological fears that plague Leonardo di Caprio while he is trying to achieve succes as a newcomer in the aviaton business.In his role as a CEO of a huge aviation company, Leonardo di Caprio has got OCD (Obsessive Compulsion Disorder), a mental disorder in which fears are entirely controlled by obsessive repeated thought and behaviour patterns. To put it more simply, the man has got excruciating fears of being touched or touching anything which he fears isnt clean. These obsessive fears cripple di Caprio while he is simultaneously trying to achieve to become the biggest aviation company of the world. I usually dont care much for di Caprio's acting talents, but this acting performance of the mental downfall of Howard Hughes is pretty impressive!",8,1,2,5 January 2019
Léon: The Professional," A gangster's fairytale
","So much can be said about this movie. It is really a wild guess that worked out brilliantly to let a kid play a leading role in a gangster movie. Nathalie Portman's debut is to thank for the truly magnificent believability she gives to her role. Jean Reno, Danny Aiello are the other masters at work. Gary Oldman however plays the part of his life. Nothing is scarier than a lunatic who smiles at you. And he plays the part of the mentally deranged corrupt criminal so well that it is a joy to watch again and again.Seen 'Leon' 10 times or more now and I keep loving it. Every time I think now I have seen it all, but it stays thrilling till the very end. And endearing. How does director Luc Besson do that? How does he make a serial killer so likeable? If I would just tell the story you wouldnt believe me. Objectively speaking this script makes no sense. None. Even a character in the movie who has to explain what has happened isnt believed. A hitman for the mob gets befriended with a young girl. That's the story in a nutshell. But that doesnt come close to what really happened. The story presented in a nutshell sounds sweet, doesnt it? But there are massive amounts of assasinations that take place in between scenes.How can that be sweet? But it can be, because the violence in 'Leon' is presented as if it were a game of playing cowboys and indians. That 'funny' tarantino kind of violence in 'Leon' is produced by a frenchman who came to America: director Luc Besson. This man has an odd talent: he mixes humor and childlike innocence on the one hand with brutal violence on the other hand. And somehow it works. The violence is cartoonlike and funny, but still suspensefull and realistic. Just as in Quentin Tarantino's work. You can laugh about the violent crimes in 'Pulp Fiction' but you still take Samuel L. Jackson seriously. Oh I could go on and on about this movie. Never felt a bigger urge to write about so many different aspects in a review as with 'Leon'. Because it is extraordinary unique in script and excecution by the director. I think that 'Leon' is Luc Besson's masterpiece. Brilliantly directed. Brilliantly performed. And a script that is bonkers but still so believable and endearing thanks to those magnificent young acting talents that came together in this fabulous gangster's fairytale!",9,1,1,24 March 2018
Bird Box," Completely ridiculous. NOT credible from the get go. Only suited for the braindead.
","I do like a hysteric story about people going crazy, but it must have SOME ring of truth to it. This story has NONE. It's really completely ridiculous.Director Susan Bier is known for great European drama movies. Really great. But she now, for unknown reasons, suddenly decided to go and direct an American action horror movie. European drama director and American horror movies are a bad mix, resulting in an irritating dud.Any good? Well the actors are great. But they have to act in a silly story, which they cant save from drowning. Some of the action is ok. The feeling of panic is ok-ish, werent it for the ridiculous story and the TOTAL lack of any credibility. So basically there is nothing good about it, unless you are braindead.3 stars, for the actors and some action stunts. If you have to watch it, try being drunk, perhaps you can laugh your head off...",3,3,8,6 February 2020
Burn After Reading," A Coen Brother gem: Cluster f*g at high level intelligence. Hilarious. Superb acting. Terrific story.
","The Coen Brothers wrote, produced and directed this gem. If you know these 2 brothers you wouldnt be reading these reviews, because the Coen Brothers are the pinnacle of genius of independent american cinema. Everything they make is worth watching and 'Burn after Reading' is one of my most favorite comedies of their makings. Not suited for the popcornloving masses who want simple straight comedies. Entirely suited and strongly recommended for anyone else!The story is about Brad Pitt and Frances McDormand who are working at a gym and discover a disc which they presume belongs to an intelligence agency. Because Frances McDormand is desperately in need for money for plastic surgery, together with Brad Pitt, they decide to extort an Cia agent for money in return for the disc with intelligence secrets. The Cia guy is played by John Malkovich in a truly hilarious roles. All roles are hilarious by the way. This is acting heaven! Alongside this already hilarious story there is a second storyline interwoven in which George Clooney has an affair which in an almost surreal and hilarious way becomes another clusterf*g at the Cia. The screenplay for this film was featured in the 2007 list of the 'most liked' scripts of the year. It 's a story to die for, pure genius.As always a great thumping soundtrack by Carter Burwell. Beautiful photography and editing. Everything is perfect. How couldnt it have been, because it 's the Coen Brothers!",9,0,0,9 July 2018
The Bourne Identity," I Just can't get enough! I just can't get enough!
","3 step review.1.U liked other Bourne movies? U WILL like this Bourne debut. This is a no brainer. Best bourne EVER!2. The story: Rogue intelligence assasin is on the run. Will he live? Will he die? 90 min action chase.3. Doug Liman. Tony Gilroy. Remember those names? Doug Liman is in my opinion the ultimate best director of ALL the bourne movies. I love the other Bourne versions as well, but Doug Liman made the mold. He created the original. The core. And he did so with masters skills I havent seen the equivalent of yet. Doug Liman not only directed, he also produced this debut. That means he had almost total controll over HOW he wanted to shape it. And that can be noticed in the attention to detail. Everything from editing, to photography, to soundtrack is ONE. It is a perfectly mixed blend of just the right ingredients to make Bourne one of the biggest action heroes in modern cinema. It is a rush. An adrenaline kick. And Doug Liman is to be thanked for that.Tony Gilroy is the screenplay writer of this classic action packed thriller, although it is based on a novel by Robert Ludlum. And however underestimated writers can become in action movies I herald the power of Tony Gilroy's words in Bourne's debut. Most of all I like the friction between the characters. Everyone is under pressure, under intense pressure. Not only Matt Damon but everybody connected to this assasin on the run story is likely to get wasted in a storm of bullets. Supporting roles are excellent, at a level unheard of in most blockbusters. That is typical of all the Bourne movies in which acting is paramount! The story and the words that make these characters believable are what Tony Gilroy is to be thanked for. And when I can believe in the characters on the screen, then I know I can enjoy a movie time and again. You are about to see the very best in modern action movie history: the Bourne debut. I must have seen it dozens of times and I still cant get enough of it.",10,0,0,26 April 2018
The Italian Job," One of the greatest heist movies! Funny, fast and smart. Simply perfect.
","Seen many many many heist movies over the last 4 decades, but 'The Italian Job' truly deserves the title of being one of the funniest of them all. The jokes in it are really great and they stay great, even after having watched this movie over 20 times! I am not kiddin'! Repeated viewing is the ultimate test to find out if the jokes and dialogues are truly fun AND true to life.Not only the jokes, but the story is terrific as well. Everything about this movies' technical skills oozes craftsmanship! The photography, the editing and soundtrack are marvellous as well. And I mean really REALLY splendid, on a level really few other movies ever achieve. There is a good reason: the direction is done by the same director that gave us the Fast & Furious. And the photographer who filmed this cutting edge fast action picture is none other than the man who filmed 'The Dark Knight'. Those are impressive and immensely popular movies! All these great movie making talents blend together into one fast, fun filled action movie that can be enjoyed by all, young and old. Simply the perfect, irresistible action movie that leaves me behind with a big smile on my face every single time I see it...Starring the lovely Charlize Theron, the butch Jason Statham and Mark Wahlberg as leading characters who get conned by Edward Norton. This movie portrays 2 heists with a fantastic plot. Wont reveal too much here, but the story is very smart and funny. Higly recommended! Very higly!",10,2,2,23 August 2018
The Color of Money," What goes around, comes around. Light hearted con movie with a twist. Magnificent roles by Paul Newman and Tom Cruise.
","This story about hussling pool games is a morality tale about deceit. Why? Because Paul Newman teaches Tom Cruise how to make MORE money with cheating than with playing pool honestly. Cruise however doesnt wanna cheat at first, he just wants to win. He wants to show off that he is the very best at his game. And Tom Cruise's personality is perfectly casted for this role of a superficial, boisterous young pool talent. And he is great at being just that character. Paul Newman is magnificent in his performance of an old desillusioned hussler at playing fixed pool games. He has seen it all before, has lost his edge, but now gets rejuvenated by watching Cruise playing pool with so much powerful talent. They both team up to fix pool games. Will their game of deceit pay off in the end? Or will their cheating coming back to haunt them, in ways they both couldnt have imagined?This story about fixing pool games might sound somewhat boring, but dont forget, this is a Martin Scorsese movie. This man knows how to inject drama! Think of 'Taxi Driver', 'Good Fellas' and 'Casino', to name just a few mindblowing classics. The drama in 'The Color of Money' lies in the conflict that arises between Newman and Cruise. I wont reveal what sort of collision is about to happen between them, but they will clash heads. Once partners, now bitter opponents. That idea. If you wanna see a fun filled, lighthearted dramatic Scorsese picture, then this one is highly recommended. Slowburning, lighthearted drama, terrific acting and a great morality tale.",8,0,0,3 October 2018
Trouble with the Curve," Heartfelt, true to life and witty portrait of family bonds and good old American baseball. NOT suited for diehard baseball fans though...
","Beware: NOT suited for diehard baseball fans. Because this is NOT a straight sports movie at all, hence the many negative reviews of sportsfans, expecting a sports movie which it definitely is NOT.What is it then? It is a great and witty tale about strained family bonds between a roughneck father (Clint Eastwood) and a resentful daughter (Amy Adams), who dont share any interests at all, besides baseball. But baseball only comes second in this story. Baseball is only the background in a story which portrays a father (Eastwood) who constantly snarls at his only daughter and neglects her. While the daughter (Amy Adams) still desperately needs love and attention from her father. And so it goes...The dialogues about the arguing between father and daughter are true to life, touching and full of wit and undisclosed affection. Although father (Clint Eastwood) and daughter (Amy Adams) can not get along, they still love each other, they simply cant show it. Only baseball brings them together and this movie is about one weekend father and daughter spent together scouting for baseball talents in which many heartfelt, unspoken conflicts from the past come out in the open. Justin Timberlake provides for a budding romance interlude...This movie has got so much charm, wit and lighthearted drama, that it is undeniably a winner. I've already seen it many times before and every time it touches me and lifts up my spirit. Highly recommended for any fans of either one of these 3 actors, because this movie is definitely a wonderful actor's gem!",9,2,2,15 October 2019
Bridge of Spies," Well acted, beautifully photographed, but simply lacking suspense and thrill. Really lacking suspense, because NOTHING happens in this story. Nada.
","The problem with this movie is that basically NOTHING happens. It is supposedly a spy 'thriller' but without any thrill whatsoever. The story is basically NOTHING else but one long continuous discussion about exchanging a Russian for an American during the start of the Cold War. Over 2 hours of talk, talk, talk between Russian / East German officials and Tom Hanks is rather tedious, to say the least...The good: it's well acted, for sure. Especially Tom Hanks performs well, but he cant ignite any spark, because this story is incredibly dull.The bad: the story is dull: There are NO surprising plot turns. There are NO really intense personal drama's. NONE action. NO thrill. What's left? Talk, talk, talk between Tom Hanks and Russian government officials. Tedious. Booooring...",5,0,0,10 June 2020
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Arnie's finest day of his entire carreer was starring in this riveting rollercoaster action classic.
","One of the few sequels that actually surpassed the original and then some. What a thrill to watch this rollercoaster action classic again. Still stands strong to this day, while the original Terminator looks dated and corny.This sequel has got all a grown up boy could wish for in an action movie. Adults can surely appreciate this movie as well, because this is certainly not just kids stuff. The Terminator 2 story is better than the original, the acting is more subtle than the original as well. And the photography and the stunts are off this planet. Truly mindblowing action scenes that are shockingly fun to watch.Oh yes there is a story: Arnie comes to save a kid from harm, leaving behind a trail of explosions, traffic rampages and killings. And Arnie plays the good guy. Yes, he is a killing machine that is ordered not kill anyone. That's hilarious in itself and this running joke works! He only injures everybody, to great black comical effect.Arnie's oneliners are superb (as always) and so is Arnie' s acting performance. This action movie has deservedly become a TRUE ACTION classic. What a thrill to watch it again. The full 2 and a half hours fly by, transcending me into another world of 'humanistic' killing machines, if there is or if there ever will be such a thing...",7,0,1,15 June 2019
Heartbreak Ridge," 6 stars, and I am being kind now, because it starts out okay, but it lasts a bit too long, becoming a bit tedious near the end...
","I love many Clint Eastwood movies AND the cool, calm and collected characters that play in them. This is regular Eastwood stuff: a tough drill sergeant has to drill a platoon of amateur soldiers. The first bit (the drilling) is actually fun. The movie later on never becomes really bad, but it simply lasts too long and is lacking punch. The second half of the movie is more simple combat in a war zone and I found that to be a bit boring.",6,0,0,27 May 2020
Salt," Adrenaline powered movie, therefore you wont get bored by lack of action, BUT the credibility of the story is giving me headaches.
","Want action? You got it. Want credibility? You got none. You choose.Angelina Jolie is suddenly suspected of being a Russian spy. She has to flee to prove her innocence.Riveting non stop action, with really good acting. The only real downfall of this movie is the over the top unbelievable story, in which things are possible which are just too ludicrous to phantom.

What starts out as a silly spygame, finally results in lots of paranoid thoughts and actions, which are quite funny and suspsenseful to watch, because things are spiralling out of control.One of those teenager movies which can be enjoyed by adults as well, because characters, story and direction are of high quality, much better than the average teenage movie. Just a really suspenseful and funny paranoia comedy.",7,0,0,21 April 2019
Silver Linings Playbook," Crazy love for Jennifer Lawrence!
","This is without a doubt THE movie that launched Jennifer into stardom. And deservedly so! For all those who love Jennifer Lawrence and for some unexplicable reason havent yet seen this gem there is only advice: stop reading this review and start watching!But this movie is much much more than just a fun filled Jennifer flick, because David O Russel wrote and directed this crazy love classic, a movie about 2 people who are crazy and in love. The guy is played by Bradley Cooper and besides his other role in 'American Hustle' I truly feel that this is his best performance ever.All David O Russell pictures are about families in chaos. Utter chaos. BUT despite all the chaos and craziness in David O Russell's pictures there is always a true love at the heart to be found. That is what makes Russell's pictures so endearingly huggable, loveable and crazy positive. It is so touching and uplifting to see the craziest dysfunctional people fall in love and support eachother despite all their sorrows, fights and utter craziness.Terrific supporting role by Robert de Niro! Splendid soundtrack. Great story. What more could one wish for? It is the craziest christmas feel good film I have ever seen. Gotta see this one!",9,2,2,8 September 2018
The Men Who Stare at Goats," Battling war with LOVE and PEACE
","Absurd, yet very endearing and enjoyable comedy about the war in Iraq, where a special team of paranormal soldiers were trained to 'rage war' with LOVE and PEACE. Yes,you read that right. I had lots of trepidation when I heard about a comedy about the war in Iraq. Couldnt be done, I feared. But I must admit that however bizarre this story is, it is unique and charming AND FUNNY. Gotta see it for yourself to believe it, that men staring at goats can be the essence of an entire movie.Great acting performances by Jeff Bridges, Ewan McGregor and George Clooney. But the story is the actual best part of the movie. Extremely bizarre, yet still enjoyable.",7,1,1,31 January 2020
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Too much tedious talk and too little riveting action. The bad guy isnt menacing at all and the pretty girl, isnt very pretty. Bland formula edition, barely watchable.
","EVERY Mission Impossible edition needs a menacing bad guy. It needs a really oozing hot female enemy as well. But this movie is lacking in both of them, because the 'bad' guy looks like an office clerk with a funny accent. And without a really menacing bad guy, there is NO sense of danger or excitement, which in effect causes this movie to be rather tedious and bland, the last thing I wish for in an action movie!The bad news doesnt stop here, because there is way too much talk going on. Just talk talk talk. 30 minutes of boring dialogue scenes could have easily been deleted. I mean this is suppose to be an action movie and the many talking scenes arent even suspenseful or funny. Just tedious and bland.Aint there any good? Well the few stunts / chase scenes are good and (reasonably) exciting. The fighting scenes are without real menace though. Still reasonably ok to watch for the first half, later on it really becomes slow. Watching Rogue Nation still beats staring at my wallpaper though...",4,1,4,25 September 2019
Collateral," Why watch 'Collateral' when 'Heat' is the ultimate classic?
","Tom Cruise fans surely will love this movie. But all others that arent particularly fan of Tom Cruise, be wary, because the story of this movie is not very credible: cabdriver gets hijacked by a serial killer and is forced to drive him towards the locations of 5 designated killings. Sounds thrilling. But it unfortunately lacks story credibility.I must admit though that I have watched 'Collateral' several times, but suddenly I got irritated about the uncredible story. So probably a lot of people who enjoy gangster thrillers will love this flick during first viewing, when one more easily gets swept away with the suspense of the story. I only wanna warn those who expect more: lower your expactations about story credibility...Michael Mann as a director has made many great other gangster movies. 'Manhunter' is a classic. 'Public Enemies' with Johnny Depp is great. 'Thief' however is the debut of Michael Mann and this movie is truly COOL. It is on Tarantino's favorite list. And for a good reason. Because 'Thief' has got everything what 'Colletaral' has NOT got. 'Thief' has got balls. Men are real men in 'Thief'.Michael Mann truly made his life's achievement though with the classic thriller 'Heat' starring Al Pacino and Robert de Niro. My advice to everybody would be to wach 'Heat' instead of 'Collateral' and you will have a guaranteed credible story, with mindblowing acting performances and a killing suspense with a gloriously dark final.",6,1,3,18 May 2018
The Machinist," Dark, bleak and mentally disturbing, yet very intrigueing, intelligent thriller. Excellent Christian Bale performance.
","Ingenuous plot and terrific acting.

His acting performance is way up there.Any bad? For those who want a fun filled thriller, walk on by, because this story is depressing from start till finish, although in quite a fascinating, intelligent way.The story: Christian Bale plays a factory worker, who is slowly loosing his mind.",8,0,1,11 March 2020
Bad Teacher," NOT funny. A bit embarrassing for Cameron Diaz, who has played in so many terrific comedies. This is NOT one of them...
","I love(d) Cameron Diaz in many of her previous comedies, but this movie is beneath her, because this story is just full on cheap and tacky and most of all NOT funny. Kind of embarrassing even to watch Cameron Diaz slide down to this cheap level of movie making, with an equally unimpressive silly supporting role of Justin Timberlake.' Grab some tits and we will score some laughs', that's basically the attitude which this movie must survive on and what the marketing department probably was thinking of while they made it. This movie is an embarrassment to the teenage comedy genre.Poor Cameron, she deserved a better end of her great acting career, because ever since this movie was released, her career went downhill...",4,0,2,29 September 2019

Their acting performances are both Oscar worthy.This movie is a NON sentimental, yet still very touching, impressive portrait about the fight AIDS patients had to endure to stay alive in the eighties, when they were diagnosed with this (then unknown) killing disease.The true story and the acting performances are impressive on their own, but the direction, editing, photography are all excellent as well.

Captain America: Civil War," It's ENTERTAINMENT allright. And it's good at that. Any bad? Yes, it lasts way too long and the storyline is disjointed. BUT it's still quite enjoyable...
","It's blockbuster entertainment. And it sells well, because it IS ENTERTAINING. And entertaining is all it needs to be.Any bad? Well, there are many storylines and many characters, which result in a somewhat disjointed, chaotic storyline. Could have been better with a more tight knit storyline and fewer characters. Drama and suspense ENHANCES for me when the story is straight forward and simple. The action is simple and straight forward though, but the story unfortunately is not. This story lasts too long as well, 2 and a half hour is simply TOO much for an action movie, in my humble opinion.The good: it;s FUN. it's mindless, good fun. But it also has something few other action blockbuster have: it has great dialogues AND it has great actors. I didnt expect such great dialogues in an action blockbuster. And I am quite PLEASED with that.This movie can be watched by adults as well. Even those adults who usually dont go see such action blockbusters. It isnt special or a must see, but you wont get annoyed or bored either, because (as I have said before), the characters and the dialogues make this into a grown up AND entertaining action blockbuster.",7,1,1,29 March 2020
Ocean's Eleven," Eleven men rob a casino. One of them has got a Ted Nugent shirt.
","Lost count of how many times I have seen it. Enjoyed it everytime. Never mind the sequels, only 'Oceans Eleven' is the real deal, the gem amongst ALL heist movies. With an amazing star cast featuring George Clooney, Brad PItt and Julia Roberts this picture is an actors walhalla. Splendid direction by the man who has got the best fingerspitzengefuhl of entire Hollywood, Mister Steven Soderbergh.Eleven men rob a casino. One of them has got a Ted Nugent shirt. That's the story. Will they succeed? That's the suspense. How do they do it? That's the brilliance of this masterful story. There are so many little subtle details that are eye candy that even after having watched it over 20 times I still get surprised by it. Those who wrote this story really must have had a field day, because the plot is simple but how the story is revealed to the public is very intelligent. Highly enjoyable twists and turns.Entertaining for the masses and entertainig for the movie critics too. It is liked by everyone. 'Ocean's Eleven' has got it all. It is one of those classics that will stand the test of time. A movie that you can watch at any time, with anyone for every occasion. It is the ultimate crowd pleasing heist flick, but it is done so brilliantly, it deserves nothing but praise. And a good laugh!",10,0,1,14 July 2018
The Usual Suspects," 'The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didnt excist'.
","'The Usual Suspects' launched Kevin Spacey's carreer into stardom instantly. He won an oscar for his magnificent role, but the story itself is the true star of this movie. Not many stories have had this influence and power over the imagination of the public as 'The Usual Suspects' has had. It is intriguing till the very end. And when the plot is revealed at the end, it is chillingly exciting and satisfying to find out the truth. In a poll on IMDb, the movie was voted as having the best plot twist, beating out The Sixth Sense (1999). Kevin Spacey had to read the script twice when he first received it, to make sure he fully understood it.It is an intelligent movie, made on a shoestring budget back then. Shot in only 35 days. That's truly minimal. It had gotten only a limited release in America, because it wasnt expected to do very well. How wrong could they have been! Never underestimate the intelligence of the audience. This is one of those movies that grew bigger and more popular long after its release, just by word of mouth reviews.I had to watch this movie at least 3 times before I really understood HOW I was being tricked into NOT knowing who the mysterious crimeboss Kayser Soze was. That trick is pulled off very simple. But the most clever cons are often the simplest ones. What is this fascinating story about? Without giving away any spoilers I can safely tell you that Kayser Soze is a mysterious crimeboss who no one has ever seen, but who every criminal fears. In this story Kayser Soze orders 5 criminals to do a heist on a docked ship in the harbor, which is full of cocaine. The criminals refuse at first, but they are blackmailed into doing the heist anyway. Will the 5 crinminals survive the heist on the ship? And who is Kayser Soze anyway? Reading my own written synopsis of the story above I must confess it doesnt sound mysterious at all. Sounds rather childish. But wait till you'll see the movie, which really has had an immense power to fascinate audiences worldwide. Acting is great! Debut of Benicio del Toro. Superb role of Gabriel Byrne and Chaz Palminteri. Photography and editing are masterful. Soundtrack is mysterious. And the direction by Brian Singer was just pure excellence. Writer Cristopher McQuarrie got an oscar. But both director and writer went on to make only mediocre action movies after this first huge succes at the beginning of their careers. Well at least they gave us this mysterious gem, which I must have seen over 20 times by now and I still get a kick out of it. What a thrill of a mystery!",9,0,1,5 July 2018

Avengers: Endgame," Silly special effects in an even sillier story. BUT the actors starring in it are good and the dialogues between them are terrific
","The good: how strange it is, that this movie is one of the biggest action blockbusters in history, but the acting performances in it are still really good! Tilda Swinton and Robert Redford, to name a few supporting actors, are starring in it! That's ludicrous. Those actors never star in these kind of movies. But they do, now. Therefore the biggest gift of this Avenger movie are the ACTOR'S. It's an actor's movie!The bad: it lasts WAY TOO LONG. 3 hours! What were they thinking? I got bored halfway through this story. The story is completely silly, although the dialogues are still very good. There is more bad: lots of SILLY special effects. I mean, come on, with SO much money available they could at least have come up with more credible looking special effects and sets, but they didnt.Conclusion: nice, mindless fun, with great actors.

Quantum of Solace," Action scenes are too fast paced and the editing is off. The flow of this story just doesnt gel. Still enjoyable enough, but there are better Bond editions out there...
","The bad: this movie was made during a writers strike in Hollywood. Director and actors had to sometimes change the story themselves while they were shooting the film. Daniel Craig was really unnerved by this tiring experience.Furthermore there was a lack of time to edit this movie properly. Action scenes are edited so fastpaced that I often couldnt even see what was happening anymore. All the big action scenes are pumped into the first half hour and afterwards little impressive action is to be seen. Why?The acting is ok ish, BUT the bad guy is not at all tough looking, but rather weird and miserable looking. This was a conscious decision by the director, but every Bond movie needs a really mean villain and this one hasnt got one. Bummer.Any good? Well, this edition has got a rough edge to it, with tough action and tough poses by Daniel Craig. I liked that. But there is also a flipside to all that toughness. Because of the contstant toughness there is no room for jokes. With the seriousness and toughness of Daniel Craig the jokes have unfortunately vanished from the Bond franchise.There is one thing quite good about this movie though. The story, however incohesive it is told, has got a credible plot, but who is interested in that?",7,0,0,20 May 2019

The Coen Brothers didnt exclusively made classics, some of their farcical comedies are flops. But ALL of their drama/thrillers are definitely worth watching. This one though reaches movie heaven. 'No Country for Old Men' has been awarded with multiple oscars and an abundance of other awards worldwide. This movie is truly a modern classic of the highest order, equalling the brilliance of their earlier work like 'Blood Simple', and 'Barton Fink'.The story in a nutshell: a hit man (Javier Bardem) goes on a killing spree in order to find a lost bag loaded with drug money, which was accidentally found by Josh Brolin, who plays a trailer trash redneck. The extremely suspenseful pursuit by the hit man is what the story is about. Tommy Lee Jones plays the sherrif who investigates the killing spree that comes along with this suspenseful pursuit of the money bag.This is NOT a mindless funny action popcornmovie. Please stay away from it if you are only into mindless entertainment. Or do watch it and get pummeled by the psychotic mood that prevails in this classic. It killed any happy mood I had, after I had watched it for the first time. But it did so in a way that is brilliant. As brilliant as the Coen Brothers can be!No one besides the Coen Brothers themselves have this extraordinory talent to make a scene interpretable in different ways. In many scenes it aint certain if one should laugh or cringe with fear. These twin director brothers have perfected a style in which they walk a tightrope between black humor and sheer psychotic suspense. Spooky note: actor Woody Harrelson's father (in real life) was a contract killer for a drugslord. Since this movie is all about contract killing, this biography fact is spooky and chilling since Woody Harrelson is pursuing a contract killer in this movie.Everything and I mean really everything is perfected in this movie. From acting, to photography and editing. And the story and dialogues are just way of the charts, way outhere. Those dialogues in some scenes are without a doubt the most thought provoking and eery dialogues I have heard in a long time.Seen it over 10 times and I am still in awe of it every time. I can still remember so vividly HOW I felt the very first time I saw it. Because I was left with a very UNcomfortable feeling afterwards. I felt lost and bleak inside. And those feelings got stuck inside me for hours after seeing it. Many questions lingered through my mind afterwards. I was disoriented and confused about what I had just seen. I honestly believe this is one of the best Coen Brother films ever made. And it is one of my most favorite movies amongst ALL movies ever made in my personal life up untill now...",10,3,5,12 April 2018
Days of Thunder," Straight blokes macho RACE movie. Wannabe cool, that's it' s downfall, because it tries so hard to be cool, that it ends up looking like a wannabe. Barely ok- ish...
","I am not a race car fan at all, but the visual and sonic power of these race cars is truly impressive. Those NASCAR race engines really blasted through my speaker. And the photography of the racing scenes is gorgeous as well.Unfortunately the story falls flat completely, but hey it will still do as Friday night blokes movie. Get a six pack, eat a lot of hotdogs and enjoy the ride. Best suited for the masses who yearn for mindless formula entertainment or for NASCAR / Race car fans.This is a typical nineties blockbuster movie, which follows the typical Hollywood blockbuster formula: young hero struggling for success, who becomes a winner in the end and also gets to take home the prettiest girl (Nicole Kidman).The reason why I only give it 4 stars though is because the story is lousy. Robert Towne (Chinatown) wrote this story, BUT Tom Cruise is featured as CO-writer. Robert Towne is a legend. That famous writer KNOWS how to write a true to life dialogue. Tom Cruise does NOT know, hence as a result we get a movie, with great actors, but with wannabe cool dialogue and story. Barely an enjoyable RACE car flick, but nothing above average, while it could have been, IF ONLY writer Robert Towne would have had full control, which he had NOT.",4,0,1,9 August 2019
Non-Stop," Smart, suspenseful plot, with good acting performances. I just kept guessing what would happen next. Real edge of your seat kinda story. Very enjoyable watch.
","Smart, suspenseful plot, with good acting performances by Liam Neeson AND supporting actors. I just kept guessing what would happen next. Real edge of your seat kinda story. Not terrific, but just a really juicy who-dunnit story.The story is about an investigation WHO, of the 150 people on board of a plane, is planning to kill someone. What makes matters more intriguing is the fact that the only cop on the plane (Liam Neeson), who has to do the investigation, is suspended and has a severe drinking problem.I know, I know, many of these Liam Neeson movies are predictable formula driven action plots, but some of those are really decently made, with a good plot and decent acting performances. This is one of those better Liam Neeson pictures. Very enjoyable to watch.",8,0,0,11 October 2019
Saving Private Ryan," Gets more impressive every time I see it. The most intense true to life depiction of combat ever recorded on the silver screen. Steven Spielberg masterpiece!
","Steven Spielberg's masterpiece. Tom Hanks most magnificent performance. Winner of 5 Oscars and more than 70 other prizes worldwide. Unprecedented true to life combat photography. Dynamic 3 hour long story that elevates this movie into the best tribute to all those American soldiers who died fighting for freedom in Europe during World War II. This is THE ultimate depiction of D-Day when the Americans freed western Europe. What a tragic and bleak, yet glorious epic war classic!The story is literally about the rescuing behind enemy lines of an American soldier called Ryan, played by Matt Damon in a small supporting role. Tom Hanks has to rescue the guy with a team of specially selected soldiers, among which are Giovanni Ribisi and Vin Diesel. Their journey to find and rescue private Ryan is a long, bleak and bloody one, in which soldiers are normal people with nervous breakdowns who go mental when confronted with so much cruel violence. This is not a gung ho funny action movie, this is how it really could have happened, with all the bleak and twisted soul shattering fears that soldiers have to conquer mentally, when they are in combat.The photography is stunning. Like I have never seen it before. Seen this movie many times now and it bewilders me every time how they have achieved such a level of true to life war combat photography. Even if you might not like the story, which I would find hard to believe, the action photography on itself is worthy of an Oscar, which it deservedly got.The soundtrack is dark and glorious. The sound effects were sonically blasting my ears when the tanks started rolling and the mortar shells were exploding all around. Editing is done with a fever pitch that keeps me glued to the screen. I can go on and on about the superb technical skills with which this movie was made, but the most important thing is that this movie has a got a pulsating righteous heart at it's core. This movie touches me profoundly. Only a few times during the last 40 years, have I ever been this fascinated by a war movie. Incredibly impressive!",10,4,6,28 September 2018
The Grand Budapest Hotel," 'It is never until one realizes that one means something to others that one feels there is any point or purpose in one's own existence': Stefan Zweig.
","Inspired by the writings of Stefan Zweig. Novelist and short story writer. Born at Vienna 1881. Died of suicide at Petropolis, Brazil 1942.This is a work by director/ writer/ producer Wes Anderson. Playful, funny, original and quite unigue! A cartoonesque styled picture about love in times of war. Cant compare it with anything else because Wes Anderson's directing style is so quirky and unique.Anyone familiar with this director will wanna watch everything he makes, because he belongs to the pinnacle of indepedent american film making. He wrote AND produced AND directed this movie. His total creative control over all his movies makes them unique in its kind. Yes it is a comedy, but not as we are used to see it. Yes, it is quirky, but not as we were used to see it before.Wes Anderson's comedies are subtle,full of tongue in cheek jokes and photographed in a CARTOONESQUE visual style that has been copied (miserably) by many others. Wes Anderson's direction style is not just a simple technique though, but a set of mind which differentiates Wes Anderson's pictures from all the other comedies. His jokes are very visual. Many many many directors CAN NOT achieve such a level of visual comedy, it is a unique talent only a few directors are blessed with. Wes Anderson is one of them.Now you still dont know if this movie might be to your liking. Let me explain it this way: IF you love arthouse movies and IF you love to be touched by gorgeous creative photograhpy and original quirky stories then this movie is definitely worth trying. IF none of the before apply to you, this movie might be a waste of your time, because it is too peculiar to be liked by the masses, although it was the most popular independent movie of that year. Please take a chance, if you dont like this particular visual style, you will find out within 15 minutes. The rest will have discovered a delightful gem, suited for young and old.",8,0,0,26 December 2018
The Favourite," Disgraceful political powerplay and lesbian lust. Not suited for the popcorn loving masses. Recommended for the arthouse movie fans of bizarre, yet true to life stories.
","Never seen such a bizarre portrait of a queen before. But that bizarre, originality is it's charm. Because of the nasty power plays that are being portrayed in this story, this movie has got a simultaneously funny AND depressing mood. Therefore this movie probably wont appeal to the masses, so beware anyone who thinks that an Oscar award will mean it's a 'nice' movie.There is nothing 'nice' about this movie. It's gross and sad at many moments. This story is being portrayed in a very odd way. I loved it, but many probably wont. Therefore only to be recommended for those longing to see an original, bizarre story, depressing (and funny) in nature.The story: a (lesbian) English queen is manipulated into political choices by a woman servant (Rachel Weisz), who is her secret lover. A new young gorgeous servant (Emma Stone) is vying for the love and attention of the queen as well. Who will become the Queen's favourite (secret) lover?Wacky soundtrack and wacky camera view points, with wacky dialogues. Add to that several lesbian sex scenes. This all together forms a bizarre, yet true to life fascinating, sad AND funny portrait of a lesbian queen.Funny, mesmerising, revolting and sad. Unique picture. Terrific acting performances. Deserved Oscar for Olivia Coleman.",8,3,5,23 November 2019
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Your mission IF you choose to accept it, is to watch Ghost Protocol, because it is one of the better fun filled and superb action packed editions of the series.
","Really funny jokes and terrific stunts, with good acting in a swirling fastpaced action blockbuster.The second part of the movie is more dedicated to big stunts, which are a bit unbelievable at times and truthfully a bit boring after repeated viewing, but hey, this is Mission Impossible, so one must not take everything too seriously.The start (first hour) though is still one of the best starts of ANY Mission Impossible movies, because it has got excellent ORIGINAL ACTION combined with subtle good jokes. Just the way I like it! All a grown up boy needs for his pleasure can be found in this fourth edition of the Mission Impossible series, which I regard as one of the best of the enitre series.The story: Tom Cruise has to prevent a nuclear terrorist attack from happening. Will he succeed in stopping a terrorist from stealing the nuclear missile launch codes? The story, however silly it may sound, kept me on the edge of my seat all the time, but the dialogues are important as well, and they are fortunately quite good. The acting by supporting actors is spot on as well: funny, yet serious when it needs to be.Just great fun and exciting to watch. The best one can find when one wants to watch a mindblowing action movie!",8,0,1,3 May 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Quentin Tarantino has lost it. Former glory turned mediocre. BORING, merely hanging on. No real spark or punch. Lacking greatness and a lot else...
","I ADORED the older Tarantino movies. I am not a hater. But this movie is seriously going nowhere plotwise. The many reviewers ALL complain about the same thing for a reason: there is NO plot and there is NO suspense whatsoever. I also believe this is the most boring picture Tarantino has ever made.An hour into the movie the story is still not catching fire, nor is it original or quirky or any kind of special. Even the violence is boring. Seriously. Tarantino at least always was shocking with his few, but intense violent scenes. Not this time around. Boring again. I am not kiddin. Really boring. Mmmm... I expected much more from Quentin Tarantino, but I fear he has lost his magic touch and is now depending on his former glory, which unfortunately has turned mediocre.The story meanders on and on about a sixties western actor that has become a has been. Could have been great with magnificent acting performances, but one can definitely say that these magnificent acting performances are painstakingly ABSENT. Too bad...I think it's not that sad that this is Tarantino's second to last picture of his career, because according to his own words he will only make one more picture and then he will retire for good. He promised himself to retire, because he does not wanna become a director, who has become a HAS BEEN. I fear Tarantino already is a HAS BEEN... Time to retire for good...Any good? Well, the photography is gorgeous. The soundtrack (as always) is terrific. Brad Pitt is good. Di Caprio is over doing it. Al Pacino looks laughable. Other supporting actors are totally superflous. Oh sorry, I forgot, I wanted to tell you about the good ... mmm let's think, no that's about it...",4,4,7,7 February 2020
Behind The Candelabra," Wanna see Matt Damon and Michael Douglas performing as gay men? I tried to like it, but it is neither a good parody nor can I take it seriously.
","It's kinda embarrassing to watch Michael Douglas and Matt Damon perform (very UNCONVINCINGLY) as two gay men, because they just arent looking credible whatsoever. They look kind of ridiculous acting as gay men. Is it suppose to be a parody then? I guess, but I cant really laugh about it either, I rather feel a bit embarrassed watching it.Dont get me wrong, I usually love Matt Damon and Michael Douglas as actors, but I truly believe they failed at performing credible characters this time around.Suited for who? Liberace fans? Perhaps. But perhaps Liberace fans would be insulted by this movie? I dont know, cause I dont care for this Liberace figure to begin with, but the depiction of Liberace is done in a rather ridiculous way.I look upon this movie as another one of those experimental movies director Soderbergh likes to make now and then. Failing at it...",4,1,4,11 January 2020
Gone Girl," 5 stars for credibility of the plot, but a final 8 stars for the juicy viciousness of this surprising, suspenseful story.
","This plot is very surprising AND wicked. BUT there are some credibility flaws that start to nag a bit after repeated watching. But even though I have watched it 3 times already I still enjoy the juicy viciousness of this story.This story has got a continuous spell of suspense, which made me long to know desperately what would happen next. But even during a re-watch I still was mesmerized by the cloud of evil that hangs over it.Great acting performances. Great suspenseful direction. What an evil story.Final recommendations: dont read the spoiler reviews. Not knowing the plot definitely is half the fun. What I can tell you is that the story during the first half hour is about Ben Affleck fearing his wife got kidnapped. Things spiral out of control afterwards...",8,0,0,23 December 2019

Really great, IF the story would have taken a totally different turn. BUT it didnt, so therefore only 5 stars for a really good promising start and a scary middle part of the story.",5,2,3,19 December 2018
Drive," Soundtrack driven, claustrophobic love story, set in the criminal underworld of L.A. Photographic masterpiece!
","Claustrophobic, dark and slowburning thriller about a heist job driver, who is played magnificently by Ryan Gosling. He lives the life of crime, being one of the best heist drivers. He is cool, calm and collected. But when he falls in love with a girl, he accidentally gets into trouble with the mob. Love and crime intermingle in this wonderfully photographed portrait of the night time crime scene of L.A. Very impressive soundtrack driven story. Magnificent photography. Gorgeous still shots. Wonderful coloring of the images. Just a lust for the eyes. The story isnt particularly original, but the way it is executed is chilling to the bone. Director's Nicholas Winding Refn masterpiece. Lots of slowburning, silent scenes, with characters being filmed as if it were a slow motion painting. Gorgeous. Must sound pretty incomprehensible, if you read this description, but I am just a bit lost for words to describe the beauty of the direction and the photography powered by a very effective soundtrack. Gotta see it yourself to understand.For the masses who just wants to see an exiting heist thriller, this movie could disappoint, because it is made for an arthouse audience and not for a Transformers and Captain America audience. But the arthouse audiences will certainly revel in the slowburning suspense, because this movie excells in a grandiose way in moods, colors, still shots wherein NOTHING happens, but with a tension that just cuts me up and leaves me behind bleeding...Very impressive masterpiece!",9,3,4,14 September 2018
2012," Action, action, lots of CGI generated action. So much over the top CGI action it is numbing down my brain.
","You want action? You got it. You want to see a story with human character development? Forget about it. You choose, what you want to see. Get the popcorn ready, this is as huge as blockbusters get.The good: the CGI effects are stunning and impressive and even hilarious at times. You wont see anything better than these CGI effects, even in these days. The world is coming to an end, everything gets destroyed in a marvellous CGI special effects party. Great fun to watch.The bad: CGI effects are all there is to see. Yes, there is still a story about John Cusack and other American folks trying to rescue their family from death by a natural disaster, but the older I get the more tiresome I get of these CGI effects. There just aren't any breathers. No moments of pause and reflection, it is just a non stop rampage of CGI based disaster special effects.Best suited for teenagers or anyone else who wants to numb their brain down with CGI based special effects only, for 2 and half hours long.",6,1,2,11 May 2019
Good Will Hunting," Even if your heart is made out of stone, it will still melt by this terrific coming of age tale. One of kind! Deservedly Oscar winner!
","Hadnt seen this movie in decades and I remembered it as a somewhat cheesy, sentimental story, how wrong my memory was though, because this movie is without a doubt a blokes movie. Not cheesy at all. But is simultaneously quite touching, uplifting and most of all TRUE to LIFE. Terrific true to life dialogues! Really magnificent.This movie was Matt Damon's and Ben Affleck's SUDDEN rise to fame. They WROTE the damn thing, at their very young age. Please do watch the Oscar speech on youtube, these two young guys held when they won the Oscar for best screenplay. It's vivacious and hilarious!The story is simple: Matt Damon is a super smart whizzkid, one of the smartest in the world, but emotionally he is a messed up kid, because of his coldhearted upbringing as an orphan. The brilliance of this story is the bond he gets with psychiatrist Robin Williams, who for the first time ever, teaches the vulnerable Matt Damon how to really love someone...May sound corny, but it definitely isnt. This is a blokes movie, which women would love as well.What a brilliant coming of age tale! Just so profoundly touching, that I got all teary eyed at the end and I am not quickly moved by a movie whatsoever. It is not cheesy or sentimental though. That's the great thing about this story: it's a guys tale what it's like to be a guy, who is tough and cool, but who is unable to truly love someone...",9,0,1,16 January 2020
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Subtle melancholic comedy, typical for actor Ben Stiller's kind of humor. Not a straight comedy, still an excellent lovely gem nonetheless. Recommended for lonely daydreamers
","Beware all you Kristen Wiigs fans, she only plays a small supporting role, however charming she is. Comedic actor Ben Stiller directed this melancholic comedy himself. Stiller's style of humor is full of tongue in cheek jokes intertwined with some melancholic feelings, which probably wont please the masses who usually just wanna see a straight comedy, which this is certainly NOT. But arthouse audiences who can appreciate the more subtle melancholic comedies could surely appreciate this excellent lovely gem.The story is about Ben Stiller playing a bland and insecure office worker who is secretly daydreaming about a female co worker (Kristen Wiig), but hasnt got the nerve to ask her out. What's so special about this movie is the fact that a normal office story gets intertwined with daydream scenes. Might sound boring at first hand, yet these day dream scenes of Ben Stiller are hilarious and full of heroic adventures which are being captured with high quality special effects and cgi. Stunnng action scenes and gorgeous photography. Great soundtrack as well. All these kind of details become even more special after repeated viewing. Lots of attention for detail went into this picture.The more often I see this picture the more I start to like it. Although the story has definitely got a sad mood to it between all the laughter. But once familiar with that particular mood, the movie is a real unique mix of comedy and melancholy, which I personally love very much. In the end this picture could be loved by all those who live their dreary office lives just like me, without any romance or adventure. Just as the bland Ben Stiller character, I too love to daydream away about climbing volcanos, fighting with sharks and finding the girl of my dreams at the very end. All this gets packaged in one heck of a great subtle, melancholic comedy. Just really charming and quite unique!",8,0,0,6 December 2018
I Am Legend," Hauntingly beautiful solitude
","Hauntingly beautiful deserted New York City landscapes are one of the main visuals of 'I am Legend'. Will Smith plays the sole survivor of New York City after an virus has decimated 95% of the world population. The remaining 5% are zombies feeding on anything that breathes. Struggling to find a cure against the virus Will Smith roams the streets of New York City in complete solitude.The visuals are stunning! To see one of the most busy and well know centres of the world look completely deserted and overgrown with plants is just amazing. I am flabbergasted and in awe of the visual effects of this movie. That alone would make this movie worth watching. The acting is as good as it gets with Will Smith, who doesnt play his usual cheery self. It is pain, fear and determination that is written all over Will Smith's face throughout this movie.The suspense is thrilling from beginning to end. Although there are no humans left alive, there are still masses of zombies who will tear anyone apart. The constant looming danger of being attacked by zombies is very thrilling.There could have been an alternate more original ending, then I would have given this overwhelming visual thriller an 8. Now I lower my appreciation to a well deserved 7. Not a typical cheerful Will Smith actionmovie. This is serious stuff, brilliantly produced and visualized. And spooky!",7,0,0,17 March 2018
The Bourne Legacy," Bourne number 4 is the best sequel in the series, (without Matt Damon)
","I didnt miss Matt Damon for a second, because Tony Gilroy, who was director AND writer, made this Bourne edition into (one of) the best sequels. Total creative control in the hands of Tony Gilroy really pays off!This director is the same man who wrote EVERY screenplay of all the previous Bourne movies in the past and the very same feel of excitement of Bourne's debut Nr 1 is back in this Number 4 edition.Jeremy Renners performance in Bourne Nr 4 is very original and fresh. Then there is Rachel Weisz, the ever charming and talented actress. Splendid performance. Then a list of supporting roles that make your eyes ache: Edward Norton, Oscar Isaac, Stacey Keach. I dare say that this 4th edition of Bourne has got the best acting in it of the entire series. From leading to supporting roles everybody is very impressive.Photography is done by the legendary Robert Elswit who conjures up some of the most beautiful pictures. Really a master at work. Music and editing dance with each other in this movie, what a joy to watch and listen!Number 4 in the Bourne series is realistic, fast and reeling with suspense. Furiously gripping from beginning to end.",10,1,2,28 February 2018
Unknown," Fast, suspenseful, slick thriller. Yes, we have it seen it all before, but it is executed with THAT MUCH finesse, that it is still a joy to watch from beginning to end.
","Beforehand I didnt expect anything from this movie, I just wanted to watch a B-movie, with lots of action and thrills, to keep me awake. But I got more than I expected, and although I was sleepy when I started watching it, I was wide awake midway through. This is just another one of those unmistakable well made Liam Neeson thrillers.If you liked the Liam Neeson Taken series then you will surely love this movie as well. It' s fast, suspenseful and with lots of slick and cool looking photography and editing. I mention these technical details, because lots of action movies just dont get it right when it comes to fastpaced action photography. This one does.Liam Neeson travels abroad with his wife for business. He gets into a car accident by himself and when he wakes up in a hospital, someone else has taken his identity.This story might sound ridiculous, and for sure, it is a bit of a ridiculous story, but it is executed in such a way that is still quite suspenseful and captivating.There are many resemblances with the Bourne movies. Memory loss, being chased by assasins in foreign countries (Germany), fast action sequences and lots of suspense. It is a really decent action thriller, which the fans of this genre will surely have a good time with. It is a bit better than the average action movie, although dont expect originality either...",7,3,3,28 March 2019
The Longest Day," From a period in which lots was filmed INSIDE the studios, resulting in a war movie with terrible fake set decors and clumsy special effects. Still good action war fun though!
","This movie was BIG when it was first released in the early sixties, but it was normal back then to film lots of scenes INSIDE the studios, resulting in terribly fake set decors, lousy sound and terrible special effects, that are quite laughable now.BUT this movie is still good old fashioned action war fun, with John Wayne for petes sake as an American soldier. Things wont get any better. The jokes in this movie are good as well and there are lots of them. This is one heck of a light hearted fun war movie, suited for the entire family to watch. I saw it as a kid decades ago, but I still enjoy it now as an adult.The bad: I dont think many youngsters will have the patience to watch this slow burning war movie. But maybe I am mistaken. Anyway for the impatient youngsters watch the modern 'Saving Private Ryan' instead, which is a blistering modern war movie by Steven Spielberg, with terrific special effects and blistering action AND great acting performances. Basically everything The Longest Day hasnt got, but The Longest Day is still good action war fun, with a glorious uplifting spirit.",7,0,0,14 May 2020
Meet Joe Black," For the Romance, For the Romance, For the Romance !!!
","I am a guy. I dont like sentimental romantic movies. This movie is full blown romance though from the very start, but I was still smitten with it. Not only was I smitten with it, I was dumbfounded, touched and mesmerised as well by it. Why? How could I be so touched by a romantic movie? BECAUSE ANTHONY HOPKINS IS BRILLIANT. And so are all the other actors, and so is the music, and so is the photography and so is the story, simply MAGNIFICENT.The story sounds silly at first. Really silly. But it is executed/directed with such credibility that I can assure you that you must watch it before you disregard this movie simply by its story or trailer. Especially the acting performance by Anthony Hopkins is sheer brilliance. And the ROMANCE is as well.I wont tell you the exact story, but simply hear me out: Anthony Hopkins fears he is near the end of his life. That's one side of the story. The other side of the story is a sheer brilliant romance between Brad Pitt and the daughter of Anthony Hopkins. Ah what the heck, I simply cant find the words to describe this wonderful romantic feeling I am left with after having watched it. I am all teary eyed. Cant think straight... Simply watch it for the romance, FOR THE ROMANCE... !!!",9,1,1,6 February 2020
Hidden Figures," True feel good story about conquering racism by working together.
","This movie starts out somewhat slow, but wait and get rewarded with a tremendous feel good end part. What 's the story? The americans want to be the first to put a man on the moon in the sixties. In those days when toilets and buses still had seperate places for people of color it was a big surprise for me to find out that a lot of very smart african-american ladies were the DECISIVE help for this succes to put the first man on the moon. 3 african-american ladies in particular were absolute whizkids who outsmarted any Nasa mathematician of that time. Incredible true story.Mind you racism against african americans in those days was really violent and widespread. Martin Luther King got shot late in the sixties, a year before the actual moonlanding. Amidst that chaos in american civil rights history, these african american ladies helped out with the mathematical calculations that were absolutely necessary to succesfully put the first man on the moon. Fascinating story, that is really well acted too, by relatively unknown actresses! The story describes the conflicts these ladies get into when they have to endure the racism of their fellow collegues at NASA. This may sound all very heavy, but on the contrary, this film achieves a definite feel good mood, while handling very serious race issues.
Very safe and predictable feel good story, despite the serious issue of racism. Made with the intent to offend nobody. No violence is shown. Everybody becomes a winner in the end. An almost fairytale like telling of a history of racism. That's my only criticism: it is very sweet and rosey, the way that period was depicted. There is even some romance in it and also some good humor. But this sugarcoated movie has got the advantage that it can be seen by kids too. And that's important, because they have to learn about this part of american history. 'Hidden Figures' is a fascinating TRUE story, that is an uplifting and inspiring tale, about conquering racism by working together.",7,0,2,21 April 2018
1917," Impressive. Claustrophobic. Glorious. NOT an anti-war movie. NO real war horrors to be seen. Slick Hollywood war movie at it's finest...
","Any bad? Not much, BUT it is 'glorifying' one of the most hideous wars, with lots of violins and supposedly heroic acts, the way Hollywood typically likes to portray war movies. That's only a minor gripe though. The acting by the unknown leading actors isnt great, but it surely aint terrible either.Suited for families, because there is NONE real war horror to be seen, everything is presented as another exciting action game without disgusting violence, evertything constantly smoothed over by glorious sounding violins.The good; it's indeed a brilliantly photographed movie. Really impressive and deservedly awarded with an Oscar for photography, but NOT for Best Picture. More good: it's a fascinating and thrilling spectacle from start to finish. The masses will love this kind of spectacle Hollywood war movie. I loved it too!The story is simple: 2 soldiers have to sneak through enemy lines to deliver a crucial message that will determine the lives of thousands of British soldiers. Will they get through enemy lines alive?Will I wanna see it again, now I now how the story goes? Yes, because it's a thrilling action adventure, BRILLIANTLY photographed.",8,0,3,24 April 2020
Kelly's Heroes," One of the best World War II comedies with great tongue in cheek acting by Clint Eastwood, Donald Sutherland and Telly Savalas (Kojak).
","One of the best war comedies out there. War aint suppose to be fun to watch, but heck they a made a zillion comedies about it and 'Kelly's Heroes' is one of the most charming. So if you wanna enjoy a war movie, this is your best pick. Suited for young and old, because it is a family kinda war film if there ever is such a label. I saw it as a kid and enjoyed as much when being an adult.The story is quite simple, a small group of American G.I.'s are fed up with being shot to pieces in Europe during World War II while being underpaid, so they decide to try to steal gold from the nazis, to up their salary a bit. How crazy everthing gets after this small group of deserting GI's plan to attack the nazi's single handedly is the fun and charming part of this hilarious story.They used a French town which had to be partly demolished anyway for the final glorious combat scenes. No CGI, because this was the seventies dude! Therefore many, many great explosions in which REAL buildings get vaporized, can be enjoyed! Although some of the explosions are quite silly as well. Mind you we are talking about the early seventies here in which fake blood was actually ketchup and didnt look convincing whatsoever. But this all adds to the fun spirit of this war comedy in which nothing has to be taken seriously.",8,4,5,15 January 2019

'Children of Men' does all that to me. And mind you, I have seen it now over 5 times, and honestly it does get more impressive every time I see it...'Children of Men' has got a heart. A warm endearing heart that pulsates louder than the exploding bombs in this movie. A lust for life runs through this picture that is like an adrenaline shot.Superlatives dont suffice to describe this gritty, violent, bleak and depressive story about a world in which a virus has caused an epidemic of child deaths at birth. No children have been born in years. One girl only, an illegal immigrant girl, has gotten pregnant and she carries the weight of the world on her shoulders because the existence of humanity is at stake here. If her new born dies, humans as a species, will cease to exist. If she can manage to keep her newborn alive, mankind has got a chance for survival.Clive Owen plays the man who accompanies this young pregnant girl literally through a battlefield, towards a safe haven. I think it is one of his best performances. Michael Caine and Julliane Moore play supporting roles that are to die for as well. The acting in this picture is sublime!Alfonso Quaron directed, wrote and edited this picture. He has also made 'Gravity' (with Sandra Bullock in space), which has won numerous Oscars. This director is a movie genius. He only makes 1 movie in every 4-5 years, but he creates classics EVERY time.'Children of Men' has got a natural beauty and rhythm to it, that is astonishingly impressive. How many times have I seen movies that flow so seemingly effortlessly? Not that I want to get technical, but this movie is as real as it gets in front AND behind the camera. The photography of this picture is Oscar worthy. Just follow closely how long the scenes last without ANY cut in it at all. While bombs explode, buildings are tore down, when people storm the streets, minutes and minutes go by without any cut in the scenes. That takes an effort similar to an orchestration of a classical symphony. It must have taken enormous efforts and time to make this picture as ravishing as it has become. 'Children of Men' has that quality of real life imagery, so real that you just forget you are watching a movie. It is enticing, worrisome, suspenseful, heartwarming and thrilling.And still I feel I havent giving it enough praise. A classic can have that effect on me. I wanna conclude with a statement of the director himself:Alfonso Cuarón has stated that he 'didn't want to make a film that ends when the credits roll. He wanted to make a film that, when the final credits roll...that's really the beginning of the film'.This movie left me behind with a feeling of bewilderment about the future of mankind and the disgraceful world we live in now...",9,2,4,17 May 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," I never liked Star Wars before, BUT I have always liked Oscar Isaac, Adam Driver, Laura Dern and Benecio del Torro. These great actors make this story bearable to watch!
","I never really liked any of the other Star Wars editions. I dont particularly like this one either, but what makes this edition positively bearable are OSCAR ISAAC, ADAM DRIVER, LAURA DERN AND BENECIO DEL TORRO. These GREAT actors usually only play in small, yet brilliant arthouse movies. These are all renowned actors, who have played in many classics. Solely their presence made me curious enough to start watching this Star Wars movie. And this Start Wars edition is quite ok, as far as these blockbuster's made for teenagers can ever be ok...For any adult or non Star Wars fan out there, this is my advice: it's a commercial mass audience formula spectacle. It's nothing truly special, but then again there has never been ANY Star Wars edition that was truly special, because these movies are silly and childish. BUT these Star Wars movies can (occasionally) be quite entertaining. And this edition is rather entertaining, with terrific actors starring in it. This Star Wars edition is for grown ups as well. Seriously.Conclusion: Dont believe the hype, because this movie is NOT terrific. BUT dont believe the haters either, because this movie is definitely entertaining. It's simply mindless entertainment. To be consumed as such...",7,1,12,6 December 2019
Jerry Maguire," Romantic and Funny. Just a wonderful popular feel good classic. Perfect date movie, yet still suited for young and old.
","The story is about a young and super ambitious sports agent (Tom Cruise) who wants it all, yet looses it all. Will he bounce back and become succesful again? This is one heck of a feelgood story about achieving succes in work and in love.This is one of those movies that are so slick and smooth, that upon first sight you might think it is just another run of the mill hollywood formula film. And it is! But is done with so much exquisite charm and sharp wit that I love this formula story anyway.'Jerry Maguire' stretches well over 2 hours, which is unheard of for such a romantic genre film, but it rises above all the other average rom com movies. Rises way above them all! Why? Because director Cameron Crowe has got the unique talent to portray characters who are so incredibly likeable despite all their apparent flaws. Lovely feel good flick. Excellent date movie, but can be enjoyed by young and old. Popular classic!",8,3,4,24 December 2018
The Adjustment Bureau," An odd romantic story, with some mystery/sciencefiction elements. Watchable because of the wonderful actors, good direction and a lovely romantic feel good vibe.
","Story wise this movie has got a very odd combination of a sci-fi / mystery story, an action story and a romantic story. In the end it is nothing in particular and it is a bit of everything. Still a pleasurable watch though. The story? Well, Matt Damon falls in love with Emily Blunt, but a certain futuristic organisation specialised in mindcontrol wants to prevent these 2 from falling in love with each other, because it would cause a 'ripple effect' in history. Will they become lovers anyway, despite the odds against them, or wont they?Yes, I know, this story sounds silly and it is and I had my trepidations, but this rather silly story is executed in a reasonably enjoyable fashion. And what appears to be silly or weird at the beginning, starts to make sense in the end. (Cant reveal any spoilers). I guess this movie was marketed at a younger audience, because of the lovely romantic story AND because of the lack of any violence or swearing.End conclusion: mixed bag. Certainly not bad, yet nothing terrific either. It toddles along nicely, entertaining me from beginning to end. Some might find the story ridiculous and annoying. Others (hopefully) will find enjoyment in it as a sweet and romantic action story. Best not raise your hopes up high for this movie, it will prevent disappointment. Suited for family viewing, young and old, because there is no gruesome violence (besides a punch here and there), there is no swearing etc and the story is very lovely in nature.",7,0,1,17 October 2019
Cold War," Truly excells in breathtaking visuals and sound, but is lacking A BIT in drama...
","The cold war period is used as a backdrop for a story about 2 passionate lovers, who get separated at some point. Is their love strong enough to survive the separation?Unfortunately this love story is A BIT lacking in drama. Just a bit. It only lasts 1 hour and 15 minutes. That's extremely SHORT for a dramatic story and I really missed the buildup in drama, storywise speaking. Lots of plot turns happened too quickly. And especially the dramatic relationship between the 2 lovers didnt get enough screen time in my opinion. The director admitted in an interview that he cut out 30% of the scenes and although it didnt hurt the movie, the dramatic devellopment felt a bit rushed at times. You have to really pay attention to get the dramatic cues, because many dramatic plot turns happen in merely seconds.The actors, who portray these 2 lovers deliver good performances, but they dont ooze charisma. A dramatic love story is at the core of this movie, but I am not experiencing any truly dramatic romantic scenes, which should have brouhgt me to tears or should have swept me off my feet. I missed the usual intense emotions that go along with such a story. The director made a deliberate choice to portray it this way and it has it's peculiar charm, but I was baffled by the absence of emotions as well.What is truly impressive about this movie though are the visuals and the music. Only a few genius directors are capable of creating such heavenly, beautiful images, which are almost physical in nature. I could almost touch, smell and feel the images, they are THAT powerful and breathtakingly beautiful. I still get goosebumps thinking about them. The music score is truly magnificent as well. I havent been so pleasantly seduced with truly heavenly sounding music in years! Both visuals and sound are truly oscar worthy! Just for these brilliant sound and visuals alone, one should give this movie a try...Concluding: this is one heck of a gorgeous black and white portrait of 2 lovers. Although a bit lacking in drama, it did truly mesmirise me with it's brilliant visual beauty and heavenly sounds...",8,0,1,14 June 2019
Silence," Watch 'The Mission' (1986) instead...
","Watch 'The Mission' (1986) instead...Martin Scorsese is trying to copy his own material. And the original 'Mission' was brilliant. Cant be copied. Well, it can be copied, but you get a boring, ridiculous mess like 'Silence'.Adam Driver is no Robert de Niro. And the other leading actor just looks plain silly with his funny hairdo and beard. Simply laughable. It actually could be funny, IF only I were drunk enough to forget I have ever seen the brilliant 'Mission'. But I am not drunk, hence this movie 'Silence' is an afront, an insult, to the earlier brilliant classic 'The Mission'.For all those who have never seen director Martin Scorsese's earlier work, this movie might be edible. But for the love of classics, I cant imagine anyone seriously considering this to be a great movie, when he/she has seen the impressive classic ' The Mission' before...",4,1,6,12 October 2019
Logan," When the man comes around...
","Never much liked these cartoonlike movies. Stopped watching them years ago. 'Logan' is the exception however. I like 'Logan' because it isnt all cartoonesque acting. Thanks to director James Mangold I can enjoy a superhero movie again! Know already I am gonna enjoy this movie more often than just this once, because 'Logan' is really a lot better than the average superhero movie, which is basically made for kids. Grown ups however can watch this one too.As far as acting is concerned this movie really excells. Special effects tend to get boring soon, but when I can believe in the characters, then I truly start to enjoy a movie. And so it goes with 'Logan', in which the acting is truly remarkable. The kid especially is mindblowing. Yes there is a kid playing in this movie with superhero skills. I never much liked kids in movies, because often they cant act properly, but this one can! Very impressive.Couldnt really believe the 8 stars imdb rating beforehand, but after seeing it I understand that 'Logan' rises above the average. Good. Really good.",8,1,2,21 April 2018
The Insider," 'We are in the nicotine delivery business' Based on a true story about the secret injections of highly addictive chemical ingredients in cigarettes by the tobacco industry.
","One of the best movies by director/producer/writer Michael Mann of his entire carreer. How can a movie about a lawsuit be so captivating, astonishing, touching and thrilling from beginning to end? Well, seeing is believing and watching 'The Insider' is the ultimate proof that a seemingly boring story about a lawsuit can have such a powerful impact. This movie is many things, it's a drama, a thriller and criticism of the suffocating entanglement of corporate industry with journalism.The true story by itself is already amazingly shocking, but the way it is directed, photographed, acted and scored is truly magnificent as well. Lots of praise for the terrific acting performances by Al Pacino and Russel Crowe, who lift this movie to a higher level.This movie is based on a true story about the secret injection of chemical ingredients in cigarettes, which were added by the tobacco company with the sole effect/purpose of enhancing addiction to smoking. One insider scientist (Russel Crowe), who worked for the tobacco industry decides to become a whistleblower and consequently gets attacked viciously with all means possible by the tobacco industry. Al Pacino plays the part of a 60 minutes news reporter who wants to air an interview with the whistleblower, but suddenly finds himself entangled with corporate powers who try to stop him.Endnotes: in 1998 in real life, the tobacco industry settled the lawsuits filed against it by mississippi and 49 other states for 246 BILLION DOLLARS.The deadly impact of its tobacco products cost the world's economies more than 1000 billion dollars annually in healthcare expenditures and lost productivity. Globally, there are 1100 million tobacco smokers aged 15 or older. Currently, around 6 million people die ANNUALY as a result of tobacco use.",9,1,1,1 February 2019
Quiz Show," Fascinating funny start, bland middle part and a predictable ending.
","This movie should have been at least an half hour shorter and should have ended with a bit more spark.
Acting is great though. Especially John Turturro and Ralph Fiennes perform excellently. But they cant save this movie from becoming a bit bland half way through. Still it is an enjoyable watch, but I must admit that although I have seen it several times I start skipping some parts in the middle. The story isnt very shocking to say the least, but it has become a fascinating movie nonetheless, that is to say the first half of the movie.The storyline: John Turturro, looks like a nerd and wins every quizshow episode. But the advertisers want someone younger and more attractive looking to boost the ratings. Enter Ralph Fiennes, a succesful white hansom teacher, who gets the answers to the questions in order to quarantee that he'll stay on the show in order to keep the tv ratings high. Will they find out the deceit? That is the suspense.Robert Redford succeeded in a beautiful portrait of the fifties, a period in which television was what the internet is nowadays.The sweetness and innocence of that period is portrayed beautifully, but the drama is lacking in this story and on top of that the movie lasts over 2 hours. For first time viewers this would be recommended if they wanted to see a feel good story about innocent fraud by a tv show quiz host.Could have been better. Nice anyway, but somewhat slow.",6,1,1,11 August 2018
Elysium," Matt Damon as a righteous fighting machine, who defends the poor in a scifi version of Robin Hood!
","Why the low ratings? Because the masses dont like these kind of DEPRESSING stories and according to the Imdb ratings they dont. I loved it though! But it is definitely NOT a popcorn movie, although it can be easily mistaken for one at first glance, because of all the (gritty) violence. But the violence isnt heroic or 'funny' as in many other Hollywood action movies.The violence is mean and there is no typical happy Hollywood ending either. The (popcorn) masses dont like that either. Foreigners in leading roles are probably another downer for many (popcorn) movie consumers, although I thought it was refreshing and true to life, to hear foreign people speak in their native tongue.All the technical skills of this movie are beyond good, they are excellent. And the fighting spirit of this movie is to die for as well! You gotta give this a try if you are a true scifi fan (Alien, Blade Runner) and are into underdog movies. Matt Damon is sort of a modern scifi version of Robin Hood.'Elysium' is both a heinous and glorious struggle between the rich and the poor, in which Matt Damon is the chosen one to defend the rights of the poor people on earth. In Elysium, Matt Damon is like Superman on crack: a righteous fighting machine, battling a wicked dictatorship who oppresses all the poor people on earth.Elysium is a very intense blend of raw gritty suffering and hightech scifi action. Next to classics like Aliens and Blade Runner it is the most dark and realistic form of scifi I have witnessed in decades. Terrific, realistic portrayal of hell on earth!It is one hell of an intense roller coaster ride. No time for breathers. Photography and soundtrack are thunderous and excellent. The acting is right in your face and real. The characters are humbling and in a constant state of panic ridden pain.Is a new scifi classic born with Elysium? Time will tell. The story is too depressing, realistic and dark to gain mass popularity. But it is certainly among my all time favorite scifi movies. Seen it over 10 times now and I will certainly enjoy more viewings! What a thrill!",10,0,1,4 March 2018
There's Something About Mary," Absolutely hilarious (at moments). Nineties comedy classic. One of a kind.
","The story: Ben Stiller had a HUGE highschool crush on the gorgeous Cameron Diaz. 15 years later he still secretly loves her and decides to go look for her. Will love blossom again?There aren't many comedies which make me laugh so hard (at certain moments), that it starts to hurt. This movie 'There...Mary' even makes me laugh simply thinking about it. It has so many iconic scenes that are to die for, but what is striking is that this movie is NOT a non stop silly comedy. It's a slowburning comedy, which lasts over 2 hours. Such a long length is unheard of for a comedy, but it never becomes boring, despite this length. On the contrary the many scenes that are not full blown jokes do contribute to learning to know the characters. I wouldnt call it character devellopment, but this movie is a fun story about LOOSERS, who are being portrayed in ALL their weaknesses and shameful anxieties. Sometimes gross, sometimes absolutely silly, sometimes endearing, but ALWAYS HILARIOUS.Really, really good acting and a terrific story. Many comedies NEVER get credited for good acting or for great dialogue, but this movie has both. I love it. I love it. I love it.",8,0,2,16 January 2020
Mission: Impossible," The one and only
","Hmmm, how much do I love the one and only first Mission Impossible. Many many many sequels were and gonna be made, but there is only one that is the ultimate. And you are on the verge of seeing it, otherwise you wouldnt be reading these reviews. Stop reading. Start watching. The very first Mission Impossible is the very best. It was explosive when it first came out. It is rock solid decades later. A new classic. Timeless. One of Brian de Palma's best. One of Tom Cruise's best ever. Perfect from beginning to end.",9,0,1,3 April 2018
Stalingrad," Dark, depressing portrait of the defeat of the german army at Stalingrad.Good at depicting the utter destructiveness of war. Bad at portraying the German war crimes.
","Beware: The german movie 'Stalingrad' (1993) must not be confused with identical titles, yet different movies from 2013, 2003 and 1990. Dialogues, photography and acting in the german 'Stalingrad' from 1993, are good, although not superb. 'Stalingrad' is a very impressive portrait of the utter destructiveness of war though. One of the better war movies I have seen in the past decades!'Stalingrad' is (thankfully) NOT a crowdpleasing action movie. It as bleak and depressing as it gets. As it should be, because any war movie that glorifies violence is like watching a fairytale. 'Stalingrad' is true to life though, in the depicting of the demoralizing horrific consequences of war, but it is bad at showing the German war crimes in its full colors, because this story is told from a german standpoint of view. And that shows.Looking at this movie from a historical point of view it is noteworthy that the german soldiers in this war movie are being portrayed rather positive by the german filmddirector.Not at all a balanced view, because the german soldiers were THE NR 1 cause of 2 million people who were slaughtered at Stalingrad. And if they werent being directly slaughtered by the germans, they would have died of starvation, caused by that same german army.But this unbalanced positive portrait of german soldiers doesnt make it a bad war movie though, on the contrary. I must admit that this is one of the better war movies I have ever seen during the past decades. Why? Because there are only a few war movies that DONT glorify war violence. And after seeing 'Stalingrad' one definitely does NOT wanna glorify war ever again. Stanley Kubricks 'Full Metal Jacket' is another example of a classic 'anti-war' movie. I felt sick of any sort of violence after watching 'Stalingrad'. For that specific reason I recommend this war movie very much...",8,0,1,13 November 2018
Love & Mercy," Love and Mercy, that is what you and your friends need tonight
","Knowing little about the Beach Boys music except their well known hits, I did hear about this 'doctor' who had the lead singer in an isolating grip. Many years Brian Wilson, the lead singer of the popular sixties Beach Boys band, had gone off the rails. Losing it mentally, he was addicted to medicine and was isolated by his 'doctor' from the outside world. It really is a heartbreaking story. And this movie 'Love and Mercy' has really made an awesome tribute to the music Brian Wilson made and to the wonderful person he was.'Love and Mercy' tells 2 stories at the same time. One story about the young Brian Wilson who rose to fame as a musician, and one story about the older, addicted and isolated Brian Wilson, who has gone off the rails. The combination of the 2 stories really mix very fluently. The whole movie is edited in a way a good beach boys song would sound: in total harmony. John Cusack, Paul Dano and Elizabeth Banks all act at the top of their talents.Paul Dano actually seems to sing the songs for real and his resemblance to Brian Wilson is stunning. In the end I am really impressed and in awe of this movie. What a wonderful tribute. Goosebumps all over, because the end is so emotionally uplifting. Special praise for the way the music was remixed, it sounded from another planet so spacious, intense and beautiful. Wow. I would like to add a lot of more comments but in the end it is better to just let yourself get submersed in the music. Dont forget to watch the end credits in which the real Brian Wilson makes an appearance with the song Love and Mercy. 'That is all what you and your friends need tonight...' as sung by the wonderfully talented Brian Wilson.",8,2,2,9 April 2018
Inside Man," Smart heist flick, with great acting performances. A bit of a fairytale ending is the only let down of this juicy suspenseful story.
","This story is about gangster mastermind Clive Owen who robs a huge bank and takes dozens of hostages. Escape from the bank seems impossible, being surrounded by the entire New York police force. How will he be able to find a way to escape from the bank? That's the great suspense!And that suspense is managed very effectively, because you keep guessing till the very end HOW Clive Owen will get away with a seemingly impossible bank heist.Terrific actors: Denzel Washington, Jodie Foster, Clive Owen and Christopher Plummer. They all act superb! These are some of the best acting talents that Hollywood has to offer. And they deliver. Oh yes!Any bad? There are certain flaws in the credibility of the story at the very end, which nag a bit. It could have been even better with a different ending, but hey I aint complaining much, because this is one heck of an enjoyable whodunnit movie.",8,1,2,10 June 2018
Pulp Fiction," 'We are all gonna be like 3 little Fonzies. And what is Fonzie like? Fonzie is cool'
","Lost count of how many times I have seen it, but over 20 times at least. Every time I enjoy other parts of this story, because there is so much to be liked. First of all: for all those who have never seen it, there is just one advice: stop reading my review and just watch the darn thing! I mean really, not having seen 'Pulp Fiction' equates to not ever having seen a rainbow. You havent lived without at least seeing a rainbow once, and for that matter if you are a movie lover, you havent lived either without at least seeing 'Pulp Fiction' once. The violence in this Tarantino flick is very subdued, nobody will get horrified by it. Come to think of it, 'Pulp Fiction' is the nicest movie of the entire carreer of Tarantino, in which one gangster, who is into the lord, even pledges to abolish all violence, after he witnessed 'a divine intervention'.What's the story about? Tricky question. Tarantino got an oscar for this story and the reason why is obvious, because 'Pulp Fiction' is without a doubt the most intelligent story in decades. Just experience it and you'll understand. This story structure has been copied by many other directors since, but almost all of them have failed at it. It is not a trick, that can be copied, because Tarantino does it in a way only he can. The succes of this movie is amazing. World wide it broke all records back in the nineties. It would have gotten best picture oscar if it werent for the fact that Tarantino was too young and wasnt a household name yet back then. Almost unthinkable nowadays, but it is true, even Tarantino once was fighting unemployment, struggling to get by with a job at a videostore, in which he truly found his niche by the way, because Tarantino is a walking and talking movie encyclopedia. I just enjoy hearing the man talking about movies, but there is something strange with Tarantino's favorite movies, because he likes pulp. The true definition of pulp is stated at the very beginning of 'Pulp Fiction' and it says: ' Pulp is a magazine or book containing lurid subject matter and being characteristically printed on rough, unfinished paper'. Quentin Tarantino has told in interviews that in his younger years he read those a lot and many great writers have contributed to these pulp magazines at the start of their carreer. Whatever impact these stories have had on Tarantino he sure has got the talent to tell stories like no other director can. It is almost as if you are watching a theatre play sometimes. And making theatre plays is the future for Tarantino, because he had said he will only make 10 pictures in his life and then he will quit making them. That is a bold statement made out of love for movies, because he knows and everybody else knows that every artist has only got a small period in his life in which he truly excells and makes classics that will stand the test of time. 'Pulp Fiction' is such a classic and you are about to see it for the very first time. Lucky you!",10,0,1,30 July 2018
Titanic," From the director of Terminator comes an R-rated horrifying movie about a boat that sinks and people die. Not suited for the faint of hearted. Terribly shocking
","I, like many of my age, saw this when it originally aired as a class assignment. It had a great impact on me. The movie may not be the greatest ever made, but the acting is more than adequate, especially from Jason Robards, and the script was far better than any other movies made for television at that time. I recommend it to anyone, even those with a low tolerance for grossness (radiation sickness is shown in progressive stages, and it is not pretty). It's dark, depressing, and if you get into it you will definitely need to follow it up with a musical or cartoons just to lift your spirits again. Still, the subject matter is not something that can be portrayed positively even at a tv-movie level of realism.",Null,0,3,23 February 2020
In Time," Story might sound silly at first, but it is executed credibly. Unsentimental portrayal of survival of the poor. Good acting, suspenseful story and beautiful photography.
","I had my doubts when I read about this story in which people all die after the age of 25, unless they start paying big money to add more years to their short lives. Did sound silly to me, but I am glad I tried watching it anyway, because however silly and futuristic this story may sound, it is directed, acted and photographed with impressive suspense and credibility.The futuristic settings are run down and gloomy, without any scifi stuff. I liked that look a lot. It's basically a portrait of almost the same society we live in nowadays, only a few decades ahead.The story is a portrayal of the survival of poor people in society, who cant afford to live much longer than 25 years old. Justin Timberlake is one of them. The rich can buy time to prolong their lives, the poor can't. But by accident Justin Timberlake gets the chance to live a hundred years, while his poor family and friends are about to die soon. What will he do with the long life he has been given?Without being depressive or sentimental about this struggle between the poor and the rich, this movie is quite suspenseful, with enough riveting action. It is also quite an impressive emotional character driven story with really good acting by Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried. This movie is definitely a bit better than one would judge by it's cover. Not a terrific movie, but a very decent action / light drama flick.",7,1,1,14 July 2019
The Shape of Water," Romantic fairytale. A bit too much sugarcoated and too little drama for my taste. Lovely movie anyway, but not the masterpiece I expected it to be...
","A romancic story with a twisted fantasy plot and a few horror elements mixed in for good measure. A mute cleaning lady saves an alien creature from death and hides it from the government, who wants to kill it. Will she be able to protect the alien from harm?It could have been a big hollywood standard romantic movie, but director Guillermo del Toro mixes in some ingredients usually not found in Hollywood romances, (masturbation, homosexualtity, torture) which makes it only suited for 16 years and older. It could have easily been turned into a movie for all ages though, just like E.T, if the story had been softened a bit. Or it could have been as dark as his earlier masterpiece 'Pan's Labyrinth', if the director had gone wild with horror, but the director chooses to compromise and now the end result has become a bit bland. Not a great romance, but not a great fantasy horror either. I fear this movie has fallen prey to the mediocre standards of Hollywood, because it wants to please everyone. And it did, because everybody liked it at the oscars.Maybe it was supposed to be funny at certain moments, but it didnt make me laugh really out loud once. But it did put a gentle smile on my face though. The story is a bit slow in the middle, that is its biggest flaw. Half an hour could have been cut out easily, without hurting the flow of the story. I really felt that the story lacked suspense and speed in the middle.Fortunately the ending has got a great climax. But I must be honest about the fact that I dont really understood the hype about this movie. A bit too much sugar and a bit too little drama. That would be my criticism. Lovely movie anyway...having just watched it for the second time...",7,0,2,5 August 2018
The Untouchables," Brilliant!
","Great suspense, riveting action and spot on jokes. What a thrill and joy to watch! Seen this movie so many times, that I have lost count. All along I thought I had already written a review about this movie, which has mesmerised me for so many decades, but to my surprise I had forgotten to do so. Here is my review: it's BRILLIANT! Why? Because literally EVERYTHING from editing, soundtrack, photography, acting to direction is made by the very best talents in the field. Can be watched over and over again, it stays riveting from beginning to end.The story: a single police officer, without any support, takes on the biggest criminal of the thirties: Al Capone. Will he be able to single-handed bring down this infamous gangster boss? What makes 'The Untouchables' so incredibly enjoyable to watch is the glorious story, the great acting and the brilliant direction. Story by David Mamet. Direction by Brian De Palma. Acting by Kevin Costner, Sean Connery and Robert de Niro. Things wont get much better!The soundtrack by Ennio Morricone is glorious. This whole movie oozes a feeling of a glorious battle for justice. The underdog takes on the powers that be. Besides being glorious, it is also quite surprising and dramatic at moments. And FUN. Big fun, because the dialogues are to die for. Especially Sean Connery gets to speak lines that should be carved in stone, because of their wisdom and cheekiness. Highly recommended for anyone longing for sheer entertainment of the highest quality. Brilliant!",10,0,0,3 October 2019
The Disaster Artist," NOT funny. NOT interesting. NOT suspenseful or anything else.. Just a boring, failed attempt at parody
","I would rather watch a real B movie that stinks from beginning to end, full of horrific acting performances than watch a (failed) REMAKE of a B movie, which is what you are (unfortunately) about to watch right now.The story is about 2 failed actor's, who make a movie that is a disaster, but exactly because of it's disastrous acting performances, the terrible movie unintendedly achieves a cult status, with even a certain commercial succes. Simply put: people sometimes love to see something that is unintendedly awful in a peculiar way. Great story for sure, but the execution is just bland and going nowhere. Well, ofcourse this is the case with many B movies, but honestly I just got incredibly bored after watching it for half an hour.The first half hour I thought this movie actually had something to offer. But here is a clue, even if one decides to make a movie about bad acting skills as a subject, you still have to be able to act decently and create a compelling story with a climax of some sort. It is VERY DIFFICULT to parody someone or something and the makers definitely failed at it.Any good? 3 stars for the effort and for the weirdo performance by James Franco, which has it's charm.",3,0,2,19 February 2019

The Departed," Wannabe tough. Wannabe cool. Missing excellence. And I DID expect excellence from such a star cast. Could have been a lot better..., but it is still OK though
","2 snitches try to rat out each other. 1 good snitch (Di Caprio) is inside the mob. 1 bad snitch (Matt Damon) is inside the police force. Whose cover will be blown first? That's the whole story.A copy is often never as good as the original. This movie is a copy of the original 'Infernal Affairs' (2002), which is a much more subtle, refined detective movie. The difference in attitude is enormous. 'Infernal Affairs' is especially to be recommended for the arthouse movie fans and for those who find the many swearing and violent scenes obnoxious in The Departed. The original 'Infernal Affairs' is a gentleman's detective, where one outsmarts the other with a smile and a polite, yet deadly insult. 'The Departed' on the contrary is all about vulgarity and looking macho through acts of violence. What a world of difference.Something keeps nagging at me every time I see this copy with such a terrific star cast. What do I miss? I miss excellence. And I DID expect excellence with such a terrific star cast. Matt Damon is definitely miscast. Matt Damon is always known to be the good guy in all his other movie roles, but now he has to play a snitch, a homophobic ruthless killer. That role just doesnt look convincing, although Damon tries his best. The other actors are good in their roles, but somehow I miss chemistry between them. For that lack of chemistry I blame the director Scorsese.Not every Scorsese picture has to be a brilliant classic, but when a director tries to make such a grand, star powered gangster movie, he better deliver the product. He missed the mark of excellence though. But even when Scorsese doesnt excel, it is still worthwhile the watch, with such great acting talents, therefore I will still reward it with 7 stars. It could have been a lot better though...",7,0,0,17 October 2019
Die Hard," Cant sleep when I have watched Die Hard
","It was back in the days when a vcr was still the ultimate technique for watching homemovies. In those days, 30 years ago, Die Hard was released. And unfortunately I have never seen this blockbuster in a cinema on a big screen. Never. I have only watched it on my little tv screen connected to my vcr. I had the smallest tv screen there was but Die Hard is so big that you can watch it on a phone and still get blown away. 30 years ago I rented this Die Hard video and replayed it 3 times in one night, back to back. I couldnt sleep all night because of the excitement this rollercoaster gave me. Some movies never die. Die Hard is one of them.",10,0,0,29 January 2018
Crazy Heart," Mighty impressive portrait of an addicted singer/songwriter. Brilliant music score by T Bone Burnett. Terrific acting performance by Jeff Bridges.
","This is one of those true to life gems that pops up now and then. The story starts out as a slowburning, gentle portrait of a once great musician (Jeff Bridges), who is on the low down, numbing his mental pain with alcohol. Maggie Gylenhaal plays the role of a new found love. The story is kinda sad, but it all ends in a very graceful and touching mood. Probably best suited for an arthouse audience which has got the patience to watch a man slowly fall from grace.The direction by Scott Cooper deserves all the praise, because this story might be simple, it is portrayed however with such gentle attention for true to life emotions that I just feel in awe of this gem everytime I watch it.Produced by the actors Jeff Bridges and Robert Duvall themselves. Singer songwriter T Bone Burnett co produced this movie as well. Anyone familiar with Burnett knows that this musician belongs to the pinnacle of american singer songwriters. As a result the movie score is way up there and I aint even a country music lover. Really impressive soundtrack! And a touching gem of a movie!Dedicated to the memory of guitar player and singer Stephen Bruton, who recorded the soundtrack for 'Crazy Heart' and who died at the home of boyhood friend T Bone Burnett.",8,0,0,4 December 2018
Joker," Over 10 thousand Imdb reviews with popular ratings about a bleak and depressing story of mental illness. Deservedly high praise, but beware this story is as dark as it gets..
","Stories about mental illness never sell well at the movies box office, therefore it is an achievement in itself that this bleak and depressing story has gotten so popular. I guess partly because of a huge hype (bomb scares etc) and partly because of a genuine terrific performance by Joaquin Phoenix.BUT beware all you folks who might expect to see another fun Batman-like movie, this story is genuinely depressing from start to finish. Depressing in an impressive, good artistic way though, but nevertheless really dark and bleak. I cant imagine anyone feeling cheery after having watched it.The story in a nutshell. Joaquin Phoenix is battling severe mental illness issues. Trampled, ridiculed and without any hope of a future he spirals out of control, yelling that a society gets what it deserves, when it mistreats the weak and the poor. And so it goes...Any bad? I dont know, I think I wanna see it a second time. I think Robert de Niro's part wasnt as good as I hoped for. I think the stories dynamic wasnt as gripping as I hoped for.The good: the incredible disturbing acting performance by Joaquin Phoenix. I'll think he'll get an Oscar for his performance. He deserves it!",8,1,5,5 January 2020
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Starts out funny, fascinating, gripping and endearing. Ends bleak, intense, depressing and liberating. A disturbing CLASSIC like no other.
","This movie is a CLASSIC. A bleak JEWEL, for a GOOD REASON. Watch and experience it yourself. Forget about my review. Simply experience it. For those too curious to wanna know more, please read on...Simply the opening shot is mesmerising, a car approaching towards ...? Approaching towards the totally isolated mental asylum Jack Nicholson was placed at, after he faked a mental illness at a prison, because he mistakenly thought he would have an easier time with more freedom at a mental institution. Oh man, what a mistake he made!The first hour is funny, fascinating, gripping and endearing. Ends bleak, intense, depressing and liberating. An emotionally charged, psychological rollercoaster CLASSIC like no other.
Acting performances by ALL actors involved are off the charts. THAT good. With of course an incredibly, delightful, maniacal performance by Mister Jack Nicholson himself, who deservedly got awarded with an Oscar.This is a classic, which is highly recommended for any true movie lover of intense and disturbing dramas. You wont feel cheery afterwards. I felt like I got a kick in my guts, that's why I dont watch it often, but the several times I have already watched I was deeply impressed by it!",9,0,0,30 October 2019
Edge of Tomorrow," This is a thrilling computer game like movie, which can be started, stopped and repeated over again. Literally. Quite thrilling, however ridiculous it may sound at first...
","This is a thrilling (shootergame like) movie, which can be started, stopped and repeated over and over again. Just as in a real computer shootergame. Literally. Quite thrilling, however ridiculous it may sound at first...It starts out a bit silly, with Tom Cruise being portrayed as an INexperienced fighter. But after a somewhat weird start it builds up in suspense though. The story: Tom Cruise has to conquer an alien invasion. But other than in 'real Life', this time Tom Cruise can repeat the same fight with these aliens over and over again and learn from earlier mistakes he made, just as in a computergame. He becomes a better fighter at every step of the way, but will he be able to conquer the aliens in the end?Any bad? Well, of course it is a cheap story, targetted at teenage gamers I guess. But the reason why I (as an adult) still award it with 8 stars is because of the great adrenalin rush it gave me. Many computer games might be silly, but they still can get me very excited. Edge of Tommorow has that same kind of quality. Definitely recommended for action fans.",8,0,0,24 September 2019
Die Hard with a Vengeance," New York is bigger than Die Hard with a Vengeance
","This Die Hard with a Vengeance movie is the only Die Hard sequel really worth seeing, because the original Die Hard is so incredibly good that it is hard to live up to. For anyone who loves big action movies this sequel is an excellent choice! Guaranteed good time.The story of this sequel is really clever. Lots of funny unexepected twists and turns. The action is over the top like it should be in any Die Hard sequel. The acting of Jeremy Irons and Samuel Jackson is superb and Bruce Willis is as funny as ever. As a tourist from Europe I vistited New York when Die Hard with a Vengeance was just released. I took a cab in Manhattan and I couldnt believe what was happening when my cabdriver followed a speeding ambulance through traffic. Wild stuff.Then I went to see this Die Hard movie in a New York cinema and realized that my cabdriver had been copying a scene from the movie ! I love New York !",7,3,4,31 January 2018
American Gangster," Director Ridley Scot is good at fast action, but average at portraying true to life characters. Nagging feeling that this has been done much better before AND since...
","The good: great action director. Great actors. Lots of money went into making a suspenseful gangster movie.The bad: Ridley Scot is NOT good at making characters come to life. It feels like I am looking at copy of a gangster movie. It is not raw. It is not true to life. The gangsters are not really interesting or scary.Not a bad movie. Not a great one either. And because there are so many really great gangster movies out there, I felt cheated and a bit bored after having watched it. But it will do for one watch. You wont be bored, if you are not interested in characters (like I am) and merely want macho poses and macho action. There is enough of that to please whoever wants to see that...",5,1,7,16 February 2020
The Mission," Lost for words...
","I am lost for words in trying to make a oneliner that summarizes this incredibly impressive movie. Winner of the jury prize at the Cannes Film Festival, which is the most prestigeous award a movie can get. Defenitely not suited though for the masses who might expect just another action movie in the jungle like 'Apocalypse Now'. This epic picture thankfully is the complete opposite: made by the director of multiple oscar winning 'The Killing Fields' and the story was written by the same screenwriter that gave us 'Lawrence of Arabia', which is rated at 100 at metacritics.com. That is impressive, to say the least...Jeremy Irons and Robert de Niro play at the peak of their carreers. I would dare say that de Niro's performance is equal in strength to similar performances like 'The Godfather' and other classics of his brilliant carreer. The direction and photography is like I have never seen before, because of the incredibly powerful and gorgeous pictures of the thunderous waterfall. That overwhelmingly, powerfull waterfall is featured in many scenes, because it is the home of this peaceful indian tribe, which lives just above this grandiose waterfall.The Mission is a gorgeous portrait of a peaceful indigenous indian tribe which community had converted to the Christian faith because of one inspirational jesuit father played by Jeremy Irons. Robert de Niro plays a jesuit monk. Both are passionate in their beliefs and in defending this peaceful indian tribe from being conquered by the portugese military, hundreds years ago. How they fight for their beliefs and what they are prepared to sacrifice, that is the horrifying beauty of 'The Mission'.Based on a true story, unfortunately, because the portugese conquerers slaughtered that peaceful indian tribe. It is better that you know, because this movie will shake the ground beneath your feet with its revolting portrayal of the slaughter of innocent children and women. Let this not deter you from watching this epic classic, because 90% of this picture is about the peaceful ways in which faith can bring together a community. That is so awe inspiring and uplifting, that I wouldnt wanna scare anyone away with the violence that follows..",9,2,3,19 August 2018
Stranger Than Fiction," Harold Crick was de
","You will know exactly what the title of this review means when you choose to see this movie. My review title is THE climax of the movie. The absolute point of no return. And it has all to do with simple writer's block. Now you still dont know anything and that's the way it should be, because this story deserves to be discovered without knowing exactly what is going to happpen. It enhances the fun a lot. I have seen it over 10 times now and I still enjoy it to the fullest. Never understood why little children want to hear the same fairytale stories again and again, till I noticed myself that some movies just enchant me that much that I just can't get enough of them.This movie is really heartwarming. But it is slow. I love that, but some dont. And this gem is heavily relying on dialogue and plot. Those who like reading books might be especially interested. Those who are more interested in the intelligent arthouse films will probably adore this gem as well. But those longing for a simple straight comedy might not understand the subtle humor and find it boring. I cant guarantee you will like this movie, but I can guarantee you that this movie is special because of it's story. Really special. This story is clever, yet simple and heartwarming simultaneously. I had never seen anything like it. When I will tell you that it is about a man called Harold Crick whose destiny is totally controlled by a writer, it might sound awfully silly. It is silly, but portrayed magnificently by Will Ferrell and Emma Thompson. You just gotta see it to believe it. The story is about Will Ferrel who is playing a hilariously boring tax editor. Suddenly he starts hearing a woman's voice in his head. He fears he is losing his mind. But after some research he finds out he is a character in Emma Thompsons new novel. And everything she writes, starts happening to him. Sounds bizarre. Might seem childish. But it is honestly the best script I have seen in years. And brilliantly directed by director Marc Foster, known from World War Z (Brad Pitt), Quantum Solace (James Bond), Finding Neverland (Johnny Depp), Monsters Ball (Billy Bob Thornton and Halle Berry) and The Kite Runner. This director has made the most varied choices in movie styles amongst all the directors I know. He can make action, comedy, drama or everything in between. The man has got the talent to create any world for any audience with total credibility and wonderful imagination. Remember that name! Marc Foster.Acting is always paramount. However good a story might be, without good acting the story wont be credible. Fortunately it is because of a tremendous cast: Will Ferrel as well as Emma Thompson play one of the best roles of their carreers. They are just to die for. Will Ferrell usually is associated with blunt teen comedies, being dressed up as an elf or something. Now he is acting seriously. Well on the edge of serious and funny. Emma Thompson is almost unrecognizable as an writer in despair, bordering on psychosis. Supporting roles by Queen Latifah and Dustin Hoffman, how much better can it get?I love this movie. I truly love it. It stimulates my thinking, it caresses my solitude, it lifts me up when I am down. I just feel wonderful after seeing it again and again...",9,0,0,20 July 2018

Murder on the Orient Express," Promising start, but sizzles out during the middle part. Great actors take part in this story, but the director somehow fails in making those characters come alive
","Great story. Great actors. What could go wrong? I read the average rating on Imdb and I had difficulty believing that a great story with such a great cast (Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeifer, Judi Dench) could make for a boring movie, but that's what it unfortunately turned out to be: average and boring.13 passengers on a train. One passenger gets murdered. Who is the mastermind behind this attack? I blame director/actor Kenneth Brannagh for the bland portrayal of this potentially terrific story. Somehow the characters dont really come alive. Somehow the suspense is lacking. It all looks very pretty, with beautiful photography, but the movie lacks in punch.I considered if it perhaps could be suspenseful enough for children and families to be watched, but the story is too complicated (and boring) to keep the attention of the youth.I checked out the original 1974 movie again as well, although those 1974 characters are quite sparkling the speed of that 1974 story is one of a turtle as well. That 1974 version has become rather dated in many ways. I have never given this advice before on Imdb, but you could maybe better just read the Agatha Christie book, instead of watching this boring, complicated movie.",4,0,0,17 February 2019
Sherlock Holmes," Fast, Fascinating and Funny. Brilliant direction by Guy Richie and Magnificent performance by Robert Downey Jr.
","Fast, Fascinating and Funny. That would sum up quite well, the enjoyable experience of watching this MODERNIZED version of Sherlock Holmes.Guy Richie is to thank for this modern adaptation of Sherlock Holmes, which could compete with ANY other blistering action movie out there. Terrific photography and editing. It's one of the best works by director Guy Richie, if I may be so bold to say so...What is beyond good, what is truly magnificent is the acting performance by Robert Downey Jr. as Sherlock Holmes. The man is an enigma. What a joy to watch him perform. All the actors in this movie act very well by the way, but Downey simply steals the show.Entertaining, puzzling, fascinating, gripping, funny and it's even quite a bit romantic. I cant think of any positive label that cant be tributed to this great new adaptation. Suited for all. Highly recommended.",8,0,0,9 April 2020
The Good Shepherd," A great cast with terrific actors, but still it falls short. Why? It lasts too long (almost 3 hours!) and Matt Damon (however good an actor) is miscast in the leading role.
","When I looked at the cast of this movie I was gobsmacked with awe, because lots and lots of terrific actors star in it. Still it is no good? Why not? It lasts WAY too long, almost clocking 3 hours for good sake. And it is directed by Robert De Niro, who has little to none experience as a director and his shortcomings as a director DO show...The movie looks the part. It's not a bad movie either, but it is definitely not a coherent unity. It's all over the place. Too many characters, too many storylines. And the biggest fault: Matt Damon is miscast in his leading role. I am a big fan of Matt Damon, but he simply is not the right actor for this role. Not bad, simply lacking the correct characteristics / charisma for this particular role.Conclusion: everything about this movie should have been great, but the sum total is mediocre. Certainly not bad, but it could have been a lot better, with all these talents available.The story: the story is a mess. It's about a spy in training (Matt Damon) who gets double crossed by everybody. Incomprehensible plot.",5,0,0,6 June 2020
Arrival," Guiness Book of Records: Talking to Aliens for 90 minutes long
","Those who believe in paranormal activity will enjoy this story about Amy Adams who is trying to talk to aliens that landed on earth. But when you are looking for some fast scifi action movie stay far far far away from this picture, because it is all dreamy paranormal talk with aliens. It is acted ok. The visuals and soundtrack are ok. All in all just a good sci fi flick, but not excellent. What makes 'Arrival' special is the suspense. Really good suspense I must admit, because the director does keep this story thrilling. In 'Arrival' there is this big mystery that has to be unravelled of how to communicate with aliens. And Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner are the scientists who have to fulfill this task. The different attempts to contact the aliens are portrayed in a fascinating claustrophobic tense atmosphere. Villeneuve also directed the new Blade Runner and he knows how to glue an audience to a screen even when not much is happening. Villeneuve has a great talent for creating a contineous suspenseful mood. A strange thing happened the day after I saw it. The scenes with Amy Adams encountering the aliens stayed in my mind the day after. Somehow director Villeneuve's claustrophobic mood lingered on even the next day. In the end I felt the story was a little too much paranormal and a bit too sweet for my taste.But the suspenseful mood of the movie is impressive. It is a hit or miss depending on your preferences for paranormal stuff and how rational you analyse movies. Villeneuve's direction splits audiences in half, more so than any other director.However smart it is filmed and however suspenseful it stays, it becomes too irrational for my taste near the end, but I dont believe in paranormal stuff, maybe you do...The message of love however is what makes this movie heartfelt and warm in the end. It's honestly a feelgood movie, but you must be the patient type and have a very open mind to paranormal stuff to be able to appreciate it.",6,0,2,29 March 2018
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Starts out as a formidably crafted director's gem, evolves into an excellent lighthearted drama and finally spirals into a fantastically magical experience. Bravo!
","Director Inarritu has got an unique talent to play with moving images as if he were a child. His style is so incredibley refreshing and funny, real, magical and just darn mesmirizing. We get to see true to life drama mixed in with short magical dreamlike moments. And all this madness gets interwoven with hilarious tongue in cheek jokes. Sounds crazy and incomprehensible, right? But it is still one heck of basic true to life story about love. And about great fears of not being loved...What's this miraculous story all about then? In essence the story is quite simple, although in it's display (photography), it looks more like fireworks going off! The basic story though is about Michael Keaton playing a has been Hollywood actor, who desperatedly wants to prove to the critics that he can really act by performing in a prestigeous play on Broadway. Will he succeed and become a critics favorite overnight or will he fail miserably at this new prestigeous theatre role and become the biggest laughingstock on Broadway?This is firstmost a movie about ACTING. And terrific acting performances is what you will get! Mesmirizing photography and a thumping spectucalur soundtrack is what you wil get as well. Tons of it. I mean it just wont get any better than this, you really gotta see it to believe it HOW director Innaritu has played with camera and sound to create this very playful piece of art.I just wanna applaud this movie for it's playfulness. I love it's charm, because it's full of lust for life! It's bigger than life itself, yet simultaneously so humbling and human as well. I am just a bit lost for words out of sheer exuberance! I have seen it 5 times already and it still stays as riveting and mesmirizing as the very first time...Bravo!",10,1,1,7 January 2019

Blow," Not bad, but certainly not great either. This movie toddles along nicely, but that was not what I was looking for. I wanted thrilling excitement, which I did not get......
","It's ok-ish, and during the first half it is rather fun to watch Johnny Depp rise to become rich and famous dealing massive amounts of drugs in the seventies, finally becoming America's biggest drugdealer even. Yes, it's based on a true story, but I miss drama and I miss suspense and I honestly also miss better than average acting performances.This movie never elicits any real spark or punch. It all feels a bit safe. Not bad, simply never getting out of control or dangerous. I would advice anyone who has never seen 'Scarface' (1983) with Al Pacino to watch that violently wicked classic instead of 'Blow'. Scarface is about about the rise and fall of a drugsdealer as well, BUT 'Scarface' has got everything that is missing in 'Blow'. 'Scarface' is wild, out of control, with magnificent characters and acting performances. 'Scarface' (1983) is dangerous and bleak and in your face like a wild man out of control would be. How boring to see Johnny Depp look like a good looking surf dude, instead of a real and rough gangster. NOT convincing, rather average...",6,0,0,29 January 2020
Raging Bull," 'A man is his own worst enemy'. Brilliant method acting performance by Robert de Niro. Sublime photography by Michael Chapman. Scorsese Classic!
","This classic gives me the shivers every time I see it. I just feel mentally exhausted and broken afterwards. In a good way though! However impressive it might be, I dont often watch 'Raging Bull', because it is such a sad story about the doomed downfall of boxer Jake La Motta. Based on a true story, which makes it even more sad, because we viewers are shown a brilliant boxing talent fall slowly down the drain. The reason why he is doomed is portrayed with such brilliant excellence that 'Raging Bull' is without a doubt one of the best pictures ever made by director Martin Scorsese.Praise, lots of praise has to be directed towards the terrific black and white photography by Michael Chapman. I dare say, that never before or after, there has been such a mindblowing registration of a boxing match. Michael Chapman made the mold. This photographer went on to film many other classics with his brilliant talent.If one ever wants to experience what method acting truly is, then one should only have to watch Robert de Niro's performance. The man IS a raging bull. His selfdestructive anger makes him a shortlived star and a longtime looser. So sad to see. But acted with such brilliance that I write this review with goosebumps brought on by this marvellous classic. A must watch, for any Robert de Niro fan.

The Silence of the Lambs," Seen it over 20 times and still I am as thrilled as during the very first time I watched it!
","'Silence of the Lambs' is riveting from beginning to end, made with such excellent craftmanship that it deservedly won multiple oscars and dozens of awards worldwide. 'Silence of the Lambs' is considered to be one of the all time greatest classic movies. You just gotta see it, to believe it...What's the story about? Jodie Foster plays a FBI agent in search for a serial killer who rips off the skin of his female victims. In order to better understand the way this serial killer thinks, she starts interviewing another notorious serial killer in jail, played by the legendary Anthony Hopkins. The first half of the movie is a cat and mouse game between Jodie Foster and the locked up serial killer Anthony Hopkins to retrieve information from him, that will lead to the capture of the serial killer on the run. Will they find the serial killer before another victim is slashed up?What makes 'Silence of the Lambs' so irresistably horrifying yet riveting at the same time, is it's psychological mindgame played by the locked up serial killer Anthony Hopkins. Add to that magnificent acting performance an extremely suspenseful story and you have got a classic. Man oh man, I must have seen it 20 times or more and I still get goosebumps at the end. I know exactly what is gonna happen and STILL I am THRILLED TO THE BONE! It is one of those movies that just wont break. To this very day it is as brilliant as it was back in the nineties.There have been said so many things about this movie and I recommend you dive into that AFTER you have watched this classic, because there are lots of fun trivia to be learned. There is even a special blu ray version released by classics distributor 'Criterion' of the making of this movie. I wont reveal anything here, about all the ins and outs of the making of this thrilling classic, because during the first viewing it is better you know as little as possible, in order to enhance the shock effects. Because shocked you will be, but in the most pleasant 'hollywood way'!Personal endnote: I still remember when I saw it first. 30 years ago there was a new cinema in my hometown that featured discounted reruns of popular movies. Only 1 dollar tickets for a movie. The weirdest mix of people flocked to that theatre, who wouldnt normally go to movies: mothers with kids, drunks and drifters and students skipping school. The atmosphere in this theatre was great, packed full every time . 'Silence of the Lambs' is the perfect example that excellent movies CAN be made for the masses too.This is nr. 1003 of all the reviews on Imdb for 'Silence of the Lambs'. Gives me a good understanding how popular this movie still is to this very day, 25 years after it's first release. What a thrill!",10,2,3,15 May 2018
Win Win," Money is too tight to mention
","What do you do when you are a hard working citizen and you are running into money troubles? You bent the law a little. That is what Paul Giamatti tried in his role as a struggling lawyer who is hyperventilating over his money problems. This movie depicts with humor a morality question: do you care for yourself first and profit from the innocence of vulnerable people? Or do you keep caring for others too when you get into trouble yourself? Or can everybody prosper? Like in a win win situation....'Win Win' has got many real funny moments and has a warmth to it that is common to director Tom McCarthy's work. (The Visitor). The acting by Paul Giamatti and Bobby Cannavale is spot on and hilariously funny at times. And because of the humor any conflict in the movie doesnt feel heavy. Uplifting, caring, funny and human. Those are the words that come to mind watching Paul Giamatti struggling in 'Win Win'.It is certainly not a walt disney family film, but young, old and everything in between will find recognition in this story about 2 families who accidentally learn to take care of each other the best way they can. 'Win Win' put a smile on my face and it gives me goosebumps writing about it, because the characters are so human and loveable. Lovely, funny picture about real life family issues. Truly a subtle gem!",8,0,0,14 March 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Great actors are miscast. Incredibly complicated, tedious story. Too little action.
","I recently saw the original Superman movie from the eighties. Silly and outdated in parts, yet still very funny at moments and generally speaking still quite entertaining. Why not give the new Superman franchise a try, was my thinking.The good: first looks were impressive, because the photography and action looked stunning. It has got numerous great actors in it, whom I all like very much (in other movies), BUT these very same good actors are terribly miscast.The bad: Ben Aflleck is not believable in his role. Neither is Jesse Eisenberg or anyone else. It's just one long disappointing miscast of characters. Really annoying to watch these great actors make a fool out of themselves. A better casting could have delivered a much better picture. But there is more troublesome with this picture.The most troublesome thing about this movie is the incredibly complicated story, which lasts over 3 hours! (2.5 hours for the theatrical version). I saw the 3 hour version. I cant imagine anyone not getting bored at certain moments. And I guarantee you that you will NOT understand the plot. Is there enough action at least to compensate for the messy, complicated story? No, there is way too little action. The few action scenes are good though, but they consist of mostly CGI explosions and I honestly get bored by those CGI explosions after a while. Seen it all before.I need drama and believable characters in a good story first. And they are all missing big time!

Sweet story, but lacking in any kind of real drama, because of it's Disney kind of style of direction, meaning every plot turn is neatly drawn between the politically correct lines, there are no surprises, nobody gets offended and it ends up being a quite boring picture to watch, that lasts a whopping 2 and half hours. 45 minutes too long.Still a sweet picture, maybe best recommended for families with young kids who want to become a musician, because the spirit of this movie is an uplifting positive one, that anyone can find joy in playing music if their heart is in it...",6,0,1,5 July 2019

You shouldnt read ANY spoilers because everything is depending on the plot of the story.Great acting from John Cusack, Ray Liotta and some excellent supporting actors. Suspensefull camerawork. Eerie dark music. Add a who dunnit story and you have got 'Identity'.When I am doubting if I wanna see a movie I usually check the director's other work and in this case that was the key reason to go see 'Identity' because director James Mangold made: 'Heavy' with Liv Taylor, 'Copland' with Robert de Niro, Harvey Keitel, 'Walk the Line' with Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon. All of James Mangolds movies are excellent. Although I must admit that 'Identity' has a rather cheesy slasher side to it that wasnt in his other pictures, but judging 'Identity' as a cheesy slasher movie it is good and really enjoyable. James Mangold also made 'Logan' recently. If you liked that you will probably like this as well.I really can recommend this movie if you wanna see a dark full on suspense movie with a great whodunnit theme. I give it a well deserved 7. Great popcornmovie!",7,0,0,27 March 2018
Speed," Seen it a trillion times already and I still can not get enough of it. Superb, riveting, suspensful and funny action classic!
","All the 40 plus folks know about this timeless action classic, but anyone younger than 30 years of age, might have overlooked this terrific action rampage, with terrific acting performances, terrific suspense, a terrific villain (Dennis Hopper) and terrific jokes to top it all of.You gotta see this if you are an action fan. From the days that there was no CGI, so all the explosions are REAL. And the villain (Dennis Hopper) is as good as it gets. As an extra for all the Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock fans, there is a budding romance as well. Everything one could wish for in a blockbuster action movie can be found in SPEED.Any bad? It's over the top storywise speaking, but in a good,fun filled way. Some of the stunts are pretty ridiculous, but good fun nevertheless. This movie is NOT suited for those who want credibility, but for those who want to be ENTERTAINED BIG TIME. And entertained you will be !!!",9,0,0,10 February 2020
Live Free or Die Hard," Some boring CGI effects and a lot of mediocre supporting actors have to be endured, but fortunately the funny dialogues are back in this version, making it quite enjoyable!
","So glad to see the return of the funny dialogues in this version. The original 'Die Hard' was packed with snappy, witty dialogues, which makes it so enjoyable to watch again and again. 'Live Free or Die Hard' is one big copy fest of the original movie from the eighties, with literally every single characteristic copied out of the original movie, BUT a good copy, aint a bad thing. This latest Die Hard version is a rather enjoyable one.The only things that are really bugging me a bit about this version are the boring CGI effects and the mediocre supporting actors. But besides that I am rather pleased by the return of John Mc Clane.Anyone even interested in the story, which isnt bad by the way? Terrorists are attacking the electronic grid of the USA by hacking into the computersystems, paralyzing the whole countries infrastructure. John McClane is the chosen one to protect a whizzkid who can outsmart the terrorist's computerhackers. Will they succeed?",7,0,0,25 February 2019
Lucy," Review Nr 1000:A bizarre mix of guns, Scarlett Johansson and Einstein's relativity theory.
","Seen this sci fi gun flick before, remembered it as a ludicrous incredible story. That is true. But if you look at it from another point of view then this movie can still be enjoyable. It sure has got speed, action and suspense.The weakest point however is the impossible ludicrous story. What is the ludicrous story about? Scarlet Johansson becomes a forced drugmule at gunpoint. The drug she carries however accidentally gives her superhuman capibillities, that is the ludicrous part of this story. How ludicrous? Well, she can melt with machines, she can stop bullets, travel through time back to the dinossaurs. Ludicrous enough? Still there is something to be applauded for in this picture and that is it's guts. It dares to try mix a normal gangster movie with vague scifi nonsense. And surprisingly enough I watched it till the end, however bizarre and plain stupid the story was. Normally I really dislike implausible stories, let alone this kind of bizarre time travel story. But somehow director and writer Luc Besson pulled it off. It could have been better though with a more credible story, now it is merely a good action packed scifi B movie.",7,0,0,22 May 2018
Midway," Boring CGI effects, but most of all mediocre, boring acting performances and too much talk
","B-war movie. Mediocre CGI effects, but the worst are the mediocre actors and their mediocre performances. Nothing worse than a copycat, a movie that reminds me of other MUCH BETTER war movies.The story: British and Americans fight the Japanese. Lots of talk, too much boring talk and NO charismatic leading roles.",4,2,5,3 May 2020
The Producers," THE movie that inspired U2 to name their album 'Achtung Baby'. But that's about as interesting as this movie gets...
","Joe O'Herlihy, the soundmanager for the rockband U2 came up with the idea of naming the new nineties U2 album 'Achtung Baby', because he was inspired by this very movie, in which 'Achtung Baby' is merely one of the many simplistic quotes that passes by during this completely silly movie.The good: it's completely silly. If you love silly, this is your best pick.The bad: if you dont like silly, this movie is annoying from the start. I need SOME serious acting though (EVEN IN A COMEDY) to make me really laugh out loud, because credibility and drama enhances the comedy for me personally. Simply put: I dont like completely silly movies, hence I dont like Mel Brooks movies very much, therefore only 5 stars for the truly excellent exuberant acting performances. Would have been better as an actual theatre play, which thrives on big silly acting gestures. Movies however dont.The story: an accountant finds a financial loophole by which a Broadway theatre play can raise more profits when it shuts down after one night due to poor reviews and attendance.

Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," It's only entertainment and needs to be treated and consumed as such. It's ok-ish...
","Never been a Star Wars fan. I just want to see a fun action movie. And it is reasonably fun to watch. It has reasonably ok cgi action. It has some suspense, although very little, because it's a Disney picture, so you know beforehand it will never get scary, because otherwise this movie cant be sold to the very young kids, who are the biggest audience for this kind of movie.Adults can watch this Star Wars edition as well though. It's not entirely a picture only suited for young kids, because I quite enjoyed it. It is a bit silly now and then and I got a few laughs as well.It's only entertainment and it needs to be treated and consumed as such. So dont believe the hype that it's marvellous. But dont buy into the hate that it's rubbish either. It's only entertainment...I accidentally first saw episode 8 before I saw episode 7. My bad. Episode 8 is better in my opinion, so if you are lukewarm about episode 7, please do give episode nr 8 a try....",6,0,2,7 December 2019
Flight," Does one choose to drink, or NOT? Magnificent psychological portrait of a drunk. One of Denzel Washington's best performances of his entire carreer.
","I feel this is one of the best psychological portraits of a drunk. And simultaneously I believe this is one of the best performances of Denzel Washington's entire carreer. I have seen ALL his films, from the eighties till now. This performance just makes me silent, in awe... I wanna advice the fans of other very popular Denzel Washington actionmovies to think twice though, because this is not a regular fun packed action movie at all. It is more suited for the arthouse movie lover, who is into subtle portraits of human shortcomings. This is an intelligent, slowburning movie with lots of room for dialogues. I love it, but the masses might find it boring.Denzel Washington's character is severely addicted to alcohol, but he is in full denial. While being drunk he shouts: 'I choose to drink, because I dont speak to my wife and son anymore. But I choose to not speak to them anymore and therefore I choose to drink'. Does this make any sense? To an alcoholic it perhaps does.Booze is harder to get clean of than many other harddrug, like heroin for instance. Booze is everywhere. Temptation to start drinking again lurks around every corner. Only the alcholic himself can decide to make a clean start. First he must acknowledge though that he is a drunk. Then he must have something to live for, when being sober. Otherwise the temptation to surpress the inner mental pain wont go away after being sober and will trigger another drinking rampage. And another..Director Robert Zemeckis isnt know for dramas at all. A few years later he made 'Allied' with Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, another great subtle portrait of deceit. And deceit is what lies beneath any addiction too, because one has to fool oneself into believing that drugs are the cure to make any pain go away.It does for the short term, that's why drugs are so evil, they lure you in with their promise of quick relief of any pain, but drugs slowly destroy your soul in the long run...I wanna give lots of praise for the soundtrack, editing, photography and direction. This is one of those dramas in which everthing just worked out perfect. Powerful and subtle. Doomed, yet still hopeful. Those extremes come to mind, thinking about 'Flight'. I believe this to be THE masterpiece of director Robert Zemeckis' entire carreer.In memory of Ed Limato (1936-2010)",10,1,3,6 August 2018
Looper," Messed up story. So messed up and incomprehensible that I gave up in trying to understand it. Going nowhere.
","This movie is trying so hard to be special and smart that it totally misses the point.Starts out promising and bleak and violent. And although I didnt understand the beginning of the story either I was still hoping for some comprehensible plot turn. It didnt come.Any good? The actors are good. The photography is good. The mood is violent and bleak at first, which is quite daunting.The bad: the writing. Fire the writer. Then let him return to this job of writing and fire him again. Exile the writer to an uninhabitable planet. Or forbid this writer to ever dare write a script, story, book again. What a mess!",5,6,10,7 December 2019
Casino," When the banks took over the mob...
","Gone are the days that the mob ruled in Las Vegas and their downfall is depicted in one heck of a infight amongst the last mobsters. Two of these dinossaur mobsters are Robert de Niro and Joe Pesci. Once friends, when the going gets tough however, they become bitter enemies. Will they all go down the drain or will they somehow find a way to survive this downfall of the mob in Las Vegas? That's the story.Photography, soundtrack, editing, everything is done brilliantly. I personally think this is Scorsese's last greatest work of his carreer. Everything got a bit bland and predictable later on. But with 'Casino' he delivers a magnificent portrait about GREED. 
'Greed is good' that was the motto of the bankers who in the end took over the mob.'Good Fellas' is the most popular and critically acclaimed american mob classic next to 'The Godfather', but I think 'Casino' deserves that second place more. This movie truly cares for it's characters. They become true to life. However obnoxious, crazy, violent and destructive these characters might be, I felt I got to know them as if I was their neighbour. However brilliant this epic is, I guess it is not really suited for those who just want to see a fast and funny action movie about the mob. It is nothing like 'Goodfellas'. 'Casino' is slowburning, subtle yet twisted and without the usual glorifying of violence, although it has lots of it on display...Clocking at 3 hours this is one heck of an epic about how the banks took over the mob's rule in Las Vegas. Gambling became a legit business for banks at the beginning of the eighties.The same debt ridden banks that later went on to cause the most destructive global economy crisis in recorded history. I applaud Scorsese for that stinging observation at the end of this movie. And I applaud him even more for making this masterpiece. What a fascinating story to watch. Very impressive.",9,0,2,22 September 2018
Life," Watch ' Alien' (1979) or watch 'Gravity' (2013). Both are great sci fi classics. This movie though is merely a bad attempt to copy those classics. Boring failure.
","Nothing worse then a bad copy, because this movie only reminds me HOW GREAT those other scifi classics like ALIEN (1979) and GRAVITY (2013) are. If anyone reading this review HAS NOT yet seen those 2 classics yet, they are in total oblivion of true brilliance.In an attempt to cash in on the oscar winning succes of GRAVITY the producers of Life (2017) thought they could get away with a bad copy of it.1 It doesnt look as beautiful as GRAVITY, although they certainly have tried to make it look realistic. But how much floating up side down can one take, before getting bored by it. There is so much floating upside down going on in this picture that it got on my nerves.2 There is no real human interaction between the characters. In an attempt to look credible they are constantly talking in scientific mumbo jumbo language, which got on my nerves as well after 15 minutes. And the characters look bland. They just dont evoke any emotion from me.Concluding: it is REALLY DIFFICULT to make a great scifi picture. First of all it can be quite costly to make such a picture look great. They sort of achieved to make this movie look like a sci fi setting. BUT looks may NEVER dominate the story or the characters. Unfortunately this movie is all looks and NO guts or glory. Boring failure.",3,3,6,21 April 2019
Heat," 'Heat' makes me feel like I am Robert de Niro AND Al Pacino. You just cant beat that feeling!
","'Heat' makes me feel I am Robert de Niro for a minute. It gives me an instant of illusion that I could be Al Pacino as well. I can be a hero for a minute: cool, calm and collected.Isnt that the greatest thrill!What is it that makes 'Heat' especially stand out above all the other gangster flicks? In short: the true to life depiction of heists and gun fights. They are truly riveting, like I havent seen the equal of over the last decades. I would dare to say, that 'Heat' has one of the ultimate gun fights ever recorded on the silver screen. It is filmed in a way that gives me the impression that I was there, right smack in the middle of it, because the PHOTOGRAPHY IS ABSOLUTELY MAGNIFICENT!But the acting performances by Al Pacino and Robert de Niro are ofcourse the real reason why everybody wants to see this movie. They both act truly magnificent! 'Heat' will be looked upon in movie history as THE ultimate 'battle' between Robert de Niro and Al Pacino, because these 2 legends had never acted together before in 1995.The story in short: Detective Al Pacino is trying to catch gangster Robert de Niro for a big crime he is about to commit. Both detective and gangster are lone souls, destined to loneliness forever, only to find solace in the company of each other, however hard they try to destroy each other as well. That is the bitter irony of this story.Almost clocking at 3 hours, this thriller is a contineously fueled adrenaline shot. Director Michael Mann's best work. Worthy of many rewatches, because this movie still stands strong, decades after having been made. Terrific music score as well and I mean really haunting and mesmirising music, often conjuring up ambiances which truly lift this movie up to an even higher level. One of the best gangster classics in American cinema!",10,1,1,16 February 2019
The Replacements," Ok ish. Not really funny, but ok ish. Would have fared better if some actors had acted more credible, now some performances are bordering on slapstick.
","Gene Hackman is ok and Keanu Reeves is his usual charming self, although I have seen both of them perform with a lot more spark and edge in other movies. The other supporting actors are (sometimes) fun to watch, but their absurd acting performances are stretching this movie into slapstick territory, which I get bored by pretty easily, because I never like it when I get a cue that I have to laugh NOW, because THIS is a joke, so please laugh NOW.The story is rather bland, difficult to make it sparkle, because there is so little to offer storywise. It basically is one longwinding portrait of a B-team of football players. How can that be interesting? Will they be able to perform well or will they loose every game? That's all there is to it. Oh yes, there is a budding romance with Keanu Reeves and a cheerleader on the side, so the female audience wont get bored to death by this rather dull sports movie. I got bored anyway, because romance or no romance, action or no action, this movie is just a formula, just one out of a hundred Hollywood comedies. Just going through the motions. Not irritatingly bad, but certainly nothing great either.",6,0,2,11 May 2019
Apollo 13," Sugarcoated, glorified drama. The good: it makes one feel good. The bad: it's slow and coated with so much sugar, my teeth start to hurt.
","Another feel good drama, director Ron Howard has been known for in all of his movies, with lots of SUGAR coated sentimental scenes, which the (more sentimentally geared) viewer will certainly appreciate, although my teeth started to hurt from the many almost commercial like feel good scenes, with a constant barage of strings, choirs and other glorious trumpet sounds.The good: it's definitely (Hallmark / Disney) kind of feel good and the second half is quite suspenseful.The bad: it's feel good overkill. Everything is smooth and safe.
It's tedious and slow at the beginning. There is more wrong: the first 45 minutes could have been cut out easily, although I get what director Ron Howard was trying to do, by endlessly showing us superficial family scenes. He wanted us to care about the characters, but the constant intermingled shots about the family at home really got on my nerves, because there were too many of them and they looked like Christmas commercials. Plastic.This is definitely a space movie without ANY edges or originality. But some (many?) will surely appreciate this kind of sugar coated Hollywood stuff...",6,2,3,9 April 2020
Green Book," Politically correct and stereotypical look at racism. Not worthy of best picture oscar, yet still an enjoyable feel good movie, with good acting and funny jokes.
","The good: this movie has got a charm about it that is undeniably very enjoyable and upbeat, which I quite enjoyed watching. It has a soft outlook on racism without any harsh images of violence, therefore it is suited to be watched by young children as well. Great acting performance by Viggo Mortenson, who really stole the show as an Italian-American bouncer, who first used to hate black people, but learns to like them pretty quickly, when his new boss is black and pays him extraordinary well.The bad: I must admit I almost fell asleep midway this movie, because the story was purposely made to be so incredibly politically correct, that I got bored beyond belief. The african-american musician is constantly victorious and superior from the very start. The Italian bouncer is portrayed as being completely stupid and racist and ofcourse he will stay stupid, but he overcomes his racism, when his boss pays him extraoridinary well. Both very one dimensional portraits, which become quite boring after a while.Certainly nothing worthy of a best picture oscar, nor of best supporting actor, but it ofcourse DID win both oscars anyway, because this movie offended nobody and was therefore the perfect example of politically correct thinking, which is what Hollywood really loves, because confirming what everybody else is thinking, (or ought to be thinking), is good for the box office and good for the public image, but it will never produce an intelligent, true to life story about racism. This is a white audiences movie about racism, made FOR white people and made BY white people. Very enjoyable and feelgood nonetheless, but a bit bland and sleep evoking at times.",7,3,6,1 March 2019
Annihilation," Kinda mysterious, but lacking in suspense and credibility. Some actors perform below par, making this movie a half hearted attempt at making something special.
","NOT horror and not a real thriller at all. Kinda mysterious plot, which keeps the suspense barely alive to watch it through till the end. The sci-fi special effects are really rather unimpressive and sometimes even plain silly. I mean, when I wanna see a sci-fi picture I wanna be able to believe in another futuristic world, but instead I have to watch these quite unconvincing cgi effects. Real bummer.What's not enjoyable either are some of the supporting actors, who honestly act below par and would be better of in a tv movie. Oh hang on a minute, this is a tv (netflix) movie. Well it has that typical politically correct narrative, which wants to please everyone and consequentially turns out to be quite bland. Nathalie Portman, Oscar Isaac and Jennifer Jason Leigh all act really great though, but that cant save this movie from slowly going down the drain.The story: Nathalie Portman (ex-military/biologist) strays off into the woods with a team of scientists to discover why a mysterious coloured cloud kills everybody who dares to enter. Oscar Isaac plays the sole fortunate person to have ever survived entering this mysterious cloud. Why did he survive? And what is lurking inside this mysterious killer cloud?",5,0,4,19 July 2019
Jackie Brown," 'Is it this aisle Louis? Louisssss?'
","Some say 'Jackie Brown' is Tarantino's best work. I would say it at least equals the other masterpiece 'Pulp Fiction'. If you love his other work, then you must give this gem a chance, although everything is done very differently then in his other work, yet the Tarantino magic is still very recognizable and highly enjoyable. Higly enjoyable! I would say that 'Jackie Brown' is his most playful work, yet simultaneously it is also his most serious work. It just oozes creativity and fun in his typical Tarantino direction style, but the story and the characters are still being portrayed very seriously, unlike many other Tarantino works in which characters often become almost cartoon like. This story is told entirely chronologically, with only one flashback. It is based on a story by Elmore Leonard, who has written numerous great stories, that have been turned into movie scripts. Quentin Tarantino got to know of this famous author by reading pulp magazines in the seventies, which were the inspiration for the title of his most popular movie 'Pulp Fiction'. But 'Jackie Brown' is totally different in style and storyline, so be warned, because some first time viewers are a bit disappointed watching 'Jackie Brown' because they expected more action. It is still very funny, but it is a talking heads movie, lots and lots of talk. Some serious talk, some con talk and some hilarious talk! 'Jackie Brown' is a slowburning portrait of a woman in financial dire straits, who smuggles some money across the border for a weapons dealer (Samuel L Jackson). She gets caught and then the story unfolds in ways you couldnt imagine, because Jackie Brown has gotta save her own ass and does she know how to do that! Female empowerment Booyah! Gotta see it for yourself. Suspenseful, hilarious and touching. The huge amount of time that is taken to learn to know the leading character Jackie Brown pleases me enormously. But some Tarantino gore fans migth find it lacking in speed. I love the slowburning flow of this story, I truly think the slowness is essential to the core of this subtle portrait. Almost 2 and a half hours is the running time and I guess 75% is pure talk with close ups of Jackie Brown and the other characters. Shot in 4:3 format, the old television format of the seventies and eighties and this particular choice of the director further prenounciates these magnificent close ups of the characters. It's a talking heads movie, in which every eyelash, wrinkle and nervous twitch in ones facial expression can be observed. That makes for some stunning pictures of the actors in it. 'Jackie Brown' is an Actor's Gem! Best dork role of Robert de Niro ever. Most freakiest role of Samuel L Jackson ever. And Pam Grier is by far the star of this brilliant Tarantino flick. What a joy to watch over and over again. I just can't get enough of it!Please check out the Trivia section of this film, because it is full of fun anecdotes. Interviews and quotes by Tarantino himself are often as interesting as his movies. Just a quote that I couldnt withold from you Imdb viewers: Quentin Tarantino compares the film Jackie Brown to Rio Bravo (1959). 'It's a hangout movie', he explained. 'Jackie Brown is better the second time, and I think it's even better the third, and the fourth time. To me, that's the thing that Rio Bravo (1959) did. I remember the first time I saw Rio Bravo (1959), but I remember more the fifteenth time I saw Rio Bravo (1959). It's about hanging out with the characters.'This was my 200th review for Imdb. Thank you for reading!",10,0,1,27 August 2018
Inside Llewyn Davis," 'Farewell true love, we'll meet another day, another time...'
","Not suited for the popcorn loving masses. Stay away, this is not your cup of tea! Having said that I can now praise this wonderful Coen Brothers gem for all those who are curious about these genius movie twins. Any one who knows the Coen Brothers wont be reading these reviews, they will be watching their magnificent work. However for all those who dont yet know who the Coen Brothers are, this review might be very helpful with my one and only advice: go watch it.The Coen Brothers do it their way. Instead of making a movie about the glorified period in Greenwich Village that put Bob Dylan in the spotlights, they made a movie of the bland period BEFORE that truly gifted singer songwriter saw the light. Who would dare do that, other than the Coen Brothers? Who would dare make a movie about a singer songwriter that has no talent?Every Coen Brothers movie is full of losers: people who just fail at everything they aim for. This story aint no different. It's about Oscar Isaac trying to make it in the music business of the early sixties. And he fails miserably. But the meticulous portrait of his failing is done so splendidly, that it is a great joy to watch this man fall from grace.'A fantastic true life' drama was the quote from a disney poster that was featured in this movie. And true to life this story is. Bleak, grey and going nowhere. Nothing happens. A man loses a cat. A man finds a cat. A man goes to Chicago and returns from Chicago. He goes with nothing and he returns with nothing. Well, he has gained something: the wisdom and insight that his music carreer and his life are going nowhere. All this bland, depressing waste of effort is photographed, edited, scored and acted in such a brilliant way that I honestly dare say, that this movie gets better every time I watch it. No longer the story is relevant, but the depressing mood, that smothers every scene. And that mood is one of quiet despair and loneliness. No director can portray loss and despair with such grace as the Coen Brothers have done with 'Inside Llewyn Davis'. Magnificent!",9,1,2,7 September 2018
Joy," Strange, witty story. Sparkles brightly. Jennifer Lawrence is lovely chaotic as usual...
","Director David O Russel made a sparkling bright movie about an ordinary selfwringing mob. In between this invention story Jennifer Lawrence has to endure the constant bickering fights of her family, who is somewhat weird, to say the least. But she receives a lot of love and support as well from them.'Joy' sparkles so brightly, despite being such an unromantic story. It still has got a christmas feel good touch to it near the end, although it has nothing to do with a regular christmas movie. What matters most though is that Jennifer Lawrence really comes to life as a character in this selfmade succes story. Jennifer really shines. She is so endearing and loveable. Jennifer carries this movie.All the actors deserve praise though. Just like in ANY David O Russel movie. David O Russel knows that a movie will succeed or fail with the right choice of actors. And he knows how to direct them. That is where the David O Russel's magic becomes visible. He knows how to direct these actors in a way that a dead end story about a selfwringing mob can become a glorious and witty succes story. Very loveable. Not as great as 'Silver Lining Playbook' and not as great as 'American Hustle', because there is no real romance in this flick. The bond with friends, family and with work is the substitute for the usual romance found in other O Russel movies. It works out fine though, but I wont give it the huge praise other O Russel movies did get. Although 'Joy' has become a gem that I CHERISH, because of the rather unusual story and because of the ever present magic charm of David O Russel!",8,2,5,26 April 2018
True Romance," Full blown Quentin Tarantino flick. 'So cool, so cool, so cool'.
","True Romance was released after Reservoir Dogs but before Pulp Fiction. Reservoir Dogs was a worldwide critically acclaimed debut, but True Romance was written by Quentin Tarantino way before Reservoir Dogs was made. Therefore it is logical to assume that the real debut of Tarantino was actually True Romance, Tarantino's first motion picture, as a screenwriter.With this cool script Tarantino molded True Romance into a brilliant gangster movie like only he can make them. Yes, we gotta pay some dues to the director Tony Scott as well, but to be honest, this is a full blown Tarantino flick: 'so cool, so cool, so cool'.Every characteristic later to be found in all Tarantino classics can already be found in the script of True Romance: the referals to other movie classics, the obnoxious violence and most of all lots of brilliant true to life dialogue. Tarantino is a known addict of talkshows and I love Tarantino's work foremost for his ever brilliant dialogues. The acting is brilliant too, with an incredible big cast of now household names that perform as supporting actors. Choose your pick: roles by a young Brad Pitt, and a young Samuel L Jackson. The always to be feared Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, Gary Oldman and James Gandolfini who all play crucial and shocking supporting roles. Christian Slater's best role in his entire carreer, and Patricia Arquette has never shone as brightly as she did in True Romance. This movie is an actor's heaven. Just incredible, you wont find any movie today with such a star cast.Everything is over the top in this movie. It bursts with energy! And almost everything is full blown big. The soundtrack is subtle, gorgeous yet very powerful. The photograpy is over the top, but still very mesmirizing. The speed of this thing just won't stop. Even the scenes with just dialogues are performed on steroids. Everthing is big, fast and cool about True Romance! This picture shows Tarantino bursting to life with his first script. I think it is as great as his other classics. What a joy to watch over and over again. Just brilliant!",10,4,5,21 August 2018
The Nice Guys," NO chemistry. NOT really funny. NOT going anywhere...
","Some comedies have great chemistry and some simply dont work. I didnt like this one, BUT that doesnt mean it is a bad movie, because acting, writing and direction are done masterfully. I simply miss chemistry between Russell Crowe and Ryan Gossling.The bad: Russel Crowe is NOT funny. Never has been. Ryan Gossling isnt either. Still they both are starring in a comedy.

Best suited for teenagers or the sorts.The story? Are you kiddin?Any good? The action is impressive. Acting is good as well. It's over the top. Violent. You surely wont get bored. I did though, because the characters are only there to get blown up, chased, blown up again and chased again. There is only so much action upon action I can take before I get bored.BUT, looking at most of the popular and critics reviews, this is one hell of an action spectacle.

The Bourne Supremacy," This second Jason Bourne movie is a much darker hardcore sequel with exhilariating chases. One of the best Bourne movies of the entire series.
","Jason Bourne's girlfriend gets killed. He swears to take revenge. Will he succeed or will he die trying? That's the story of this mindboggling energetic hardcore sequel. Acting is great, but much darker than in the first Bourne movie. Jason Bourne looks like a drug addict, with his dark eyes and pale white face. Matt Damon really did everything to make this performance feel like the last in the series. It wasnt. 3 more sequels would follow. But in this second performance Matt Damon excells in catatonic acting. You gotta see it to believe it. What I mean by catatonic acting is his depressed suicidal assasin look, which is very convincing. 'The Bourne Supremacy' truly is hardcore stuff. The darkest and most energetic sequel in the entire series.Director Paul Greengrass restrained the use of the shaky cam in this sequel. Unfortunately he went overboard with that same shaky cam in the third Bourne movie. But in this movie the shaky cam really enhanced the feverishness of the action.Looking at the action, which is the main reason everyone wants to watch these movies, I really admire the exhilarating car chase. They dont come much better than this. This is truly feverish, exhilarating hardcore stuff. Editing, soundtrack and photography effortlessly blend into one contineous rampage of cars colliding into eachother. Action just does NOT stop. What a thrill. Mind you, there were no special effects during the car chase. No cgi, nothing. The real deal.The fight sequences were fascinating as well. Matt Damon uses an asian martial arts technique when he is fighting with nothing but just a rolled up magazine. Sounds soft? Not so, Matt Damon and his opposite actor tried it out on eachother before the take and were left with real life bruses. Following the bruises Damon even managed to accidentally knock out his opponent. This true to life portrayal of brutal chases and fight scenes really makes this sequel stand out.To summarize: YOU GOTTA SEE THIS. Acting is great, Action is great, Suspense is great, Soundtrack is great, Photography is great, Editing is great, Story is great. Really. I just cant enough of it!",8,0,0,28 May 2018
The Proposal," Actor Josh Brolin said he had seen this movie 3 times. He was just pulling Ryan Reynolds leg, because this is without a doubt a sentimental chick flick of the worst kind...
","I cant believe I fell for the joke Josh Brolin made during a talkshow with Ryan Reynolds, in which Brolin said that he had watched 'The Proposal' 3 times. What a joker.Dont watch it. Please dont. Maybe if you are a sentimental chick who loves cheesy, corny romcoms, then you might give it a go, but really this movie becomes unbearable to watch after the first half hour, when everything gets incredibly lovey dovey and soft romantic, the way Hollywood likes it (and audiences probably too).It's nice. Nice, in a bad way though. As in boring nice. Still quite funny at times and the acting is ok, but the story is SOOOO sentimental, predictable and boring near the end that my teeth start to hurt of all the sweetness going on...The story for those desperate to watch a chick flick: Ryan Reynold's boss is a b**ch, but she forces to him to marry her, because her immigration visa got expired. If Ryan Reynolds refuses his career will be over. Predictable and soft romantic silliness follows...",3,0,1,25 July 2019
Sully," Fairytales do come true
","This true story is well known: plane crashes in river, everybody survives. Despite this miraculous succes the pilot Sully gets accused of reckless behaviour.No riveting actionscenes to be found in 'Sully'. No big drama's either. Director Clint Eastwood's movie is a slow burner, with good but not excellent acting. There are some touching emotional moments when everybody gets rescued and ofcourse it has got a feel good ending. All in all a warm nice movie depicting a fairytale of a true story.I must confess however, that I was constantly longing for the drama that 'Flight' with Denzel Washington DID have, and 'Sully' did NOT have. There could have been made a more intense and gripping movie about this wonderful story. Clint Eastwood played it too safe unfortunately. It certainly wont offend anyone, but it wont thrill either. It is just average feelgood stuff.Last detail worth mentioning is that in real life, pilot Sully revealed that a lot of pilots nowadays are in constant debt, while some of them even have to resort to foodstamps! When you fly what do YOU want? A rookie pilot with money problems or an experienced flightcaptain like Sully with a good salary? Flight companies are now testing planes WITHOUT any pilots at all. Bigger profits for sure. Better safety too?",6,0,1,15 April 2018
Alien: Covenant," New definition of boring: Alien Covenant
","I never write bad reviews. Why bother? But I will make one exception, because the original Alien 1 was so incredibly good, it is just a disgrace for the same director to slander the legend of his own original creation Alien 1. Ridley Scott did what no other director in the Alien series has achieved: he made a boring sequel. Everything which Ridley Scott did excellently in the original Alien 1 he failed to do in Alien Covenant. First of all the acting is mediocre. Just average to soap level acting quality. Even Michael Fassbender, who is an excellent actor by all means, looks ridiculous in its first scene where he plays an android. Acting is everything. Acting is what made the original Alien great. But none of that great acting is to be found in Alien: Covenant. Add to that lousy soundeffects, lousy visual effects, lousy story and you have the most boring Alien sequel ever made. No jokes either. Takes itself way to seriously. What a flop.It is the death of the creator named director Ridley Scott. But I already knew that Ridley Scott had lost his original talent when I watched 'The Martian', which looked like a joke also.Well in the end I am forever grateful to Ridley Scott for what he achieved in 1979 with the original Alien. This man has made a legendary sciencefiction film in 1979 which has stood the test of time. If you have never watched the original you dont know what you are missing. You GOTTA see that classic! But please do yourself a favor and skip 'Alien Covenant'. Never pay for it. Watch it for free, just to see how horrible it is! As a reminder how time and money gets wasted. And then to think that director Neil Blomkamp could have been the director of this Alien sequel. That is like pouring salt into the wound, because Blomkamp really has got talent and vision. Ridley Scott however is a has been...",1,3,5,28 March 2018
All the President's Men," Classic seventies paranoia thriller. Masterpiece of director Alan J. Pakula. Terrific acting performances by Dustin Hofmann and Robert Redford.
","Some movies are just perfect. This is one of them! Classic masterpiece from director Alan J. Pakula. Terrific performances by Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford, who were both at the peak of their careers, bursting to life on the silver screen, with so much charisma and chemistry, that I am in awe of their true to life power in portraying these real life characters.Even after seeing it over 15 times I still don't exactly understand the intricate details of this Watergate scandal story, which was a true to life depiction of the impeachment of President Nixon of the United States. But the Watergate story is a gigantic suspenseful maze that is thrilling from beginning to end, therefore it doesn't really matter when one doesn't understand some of the intricacies of the plot, because the gripping level of suspense and paranoia is what makes 'All the President's Men' such a great movie. I have even seen it when I was a little kid and I obviously didn't understand the politics of the Watergate story, but I was deeply impressed by the intensity of the continuous suspense nonetheless.Mostly containing of nothing else but dialogues. No action. It is just one continuous search quest by 2 news reporters, with many newspaper board meetings, but still I was on the edge of my seat from beginning to the very end, because of a continuous level of suspense Hitchcock would be jealous of.Filmed by photographer Gordon Willis (The Godfather), who is known as the Master of Darkness, because of his excellent low light photography. Shot in a documentary style sort of photography that was very popular among many other famous paranoia thrillers of the seventies like 'The Marathon Man', 'Three Days of the Condor', 'The Parallax View' and 'The Conversation'. The images are just jaw dropping gorgeous, because of their natural free flowing camera movements.The soundtrack, which has won an Oscar, oozes paranoia and is very subtle yet creepy. 3 more Oscars were awarded to All The President's Men in 1976.This is one heck of a classic. I just cant find anything wrong with this movie. I get impressed by it every single time I see it. A must watch for all those movie fans, who love to watch one of the many brilliant seventies American cinematic masterpieces.",10,0,0,13 September 2018
High Fidelity," Bruce Springsteen stars in it, that's worth the watch by itself! Check it out. Original, upbeat romantic comedy. Suited for guys who dig great indy music and girls...
","Bruce Springsteen stars in this romantic comedy. Check it out! His small cameo must be enough to wanna check this movie out, because 'The Boss' never acts in any movie, let alone in a romantic comedy. Why is he in it anyway? Because this movie is about the love for independent music. This movie is about all those music geeks who live for music. For whom music is the first thing on their mind when they wake up, besides thinking about girls ofcourse. That's why Bruce Springsteen lend himself for this original movie in a short and very funny cameo.Besides independent music the other topic of this upbeat and very original romantic comedy is breaking up with girls. An long list of failed relationships gets portrayed. And John Cusack who gets dumped by every girl he has ever dated, asks himself the question: why? Well, because he acts like an asshole who doesnt want to commit. He just cant be trusted, hence the wink in the title of this movie called 'High Fidelity', referring to great sound quality, but also referring to great trustworthiness, which John Cusack unfortunately is lacking in.Feel good. Funny. Terrific music. And a fresh, original take on this old rom com genre. It is really totally different from the usually chewed out rom com story.Highly recommended for guys who dig great indy music. Also highly recommended for anyone who has (just) experienced a failed relationship, because it makes fun of all the misery EVERYBODY goes through when dealing with break ups...",8,0,0,19 December 2018
Up in the Air," Endearing and funny despite the melancholic story.
","The strangest thing happened to me while watching this movie: I started to like this character, who fires people for a living. Garbage men get more respect, but Clooney pulled it off and made this coldhearted manager's character likeable, while in real life I should have loathed such a manager, who fires people for a living. Lots of praise for the direction by Jason Reitman, because he achieved to make a melancholic feel good picture about a subject that is just depressing: firing people. Everything is smooth about this picture. Endearingly, funny smooth. Just a lovely melancholic romantic comedy mixed into a depresing story about firing people.Acting is terrific. Really subtle. The funny and endearing characters got my sympathy, although all of the characters were rather selfish and superficial. Still I really liked and understood them in the end. Great role by Anna Kendrick. This movie might seem like an innocent story about Clooney flirting with stewardesses while travelling the country for his job, but there is a lot more to it. It really gives a warmhearted message about the pros and cons of commitment in a relationship. Touching, funny and true to life portrait of a loner who is in doubt wether he wants to settle down and have a family... Will he or wont he?Gorgeous soundtrack. Mesmirizing photography and very impressive editing.It is truly a splendid gem. I think it is director Reitman's best work.",8,1,2,18 July 2018
The Godfather," 1972 was the year it was released and till this day it has remained it's strength, it's magic, it's glory and doom. No need to review it, this is just one long tribute
","2 word advice: watch it. Just watch it.The rest of this review isnt a review, it is a tribute to one of the most impressive movies I have ever seen. And I have seen it many many times by now and it still stands strong to this very day.Choose the restored version if you can. It has 4K images, beautiful picture quality! However great a classic this movie might be, the original movie wasnt preserved very well at all. Yes, it seems astounding to hear that such a great classic wasnt preserved with care by the filmstudio or the director himself, but when they wanted to restore the picture they literally had to search over the whole world to find parts of the original copies of this movie that were in good enough state to be used for the restoration version in 4K.The photographer of The Godfather was Gordon Willis, famously called 'The master of Darkness' ever since he made this classic, because of his extraordinary use of low lighting techiques with very deep colors of black and dark. Especially the opening scenes with Marlon Brando are masterful.2 more things I want to mention which just mesmirise me time and again when I watch it. First, those eyes of Al Pacino. Those killershark eyes. Never before or after have I ever seen Al Pacino look so psychopatically stonecold as in The Godfather. Ofcourse Marlon Brando gets lauded for his excellent performance, but Brando oozes sympahty with his kind looks. Al Pacino just is a killer personified. It freaks me out again and again, he has become the ultimate personification of the ruthless businesslike killer mentality of the mob.Last but not least, I wanna applaud the soundtrack, that mesmirising soundtrack. Anybody knows it. I have heard it a zillion times and it gives me goosebumps time and again. Not of this earth, so beautiful. And that can be said as well of this entire magnificent classic: unprecedented power and beauty. BRAVO! BRAVO! BRAVO!",10,0,1,6 April 2019
