The Ring," horror not totally fun or great but compellingly disturbing
","I just saw this film.  I was quite impressed until thinking about how some of the elements of the film didn't add up.  Why was Naomi Watts a bottle blond?  Why were the 'scary' people dark-haired with everyone else in between?  It seemed contrived, with badly bleached and dyed hair.  That was really ugly, black hair I was seeing.  I have hair that color, and it's not that ugly.  That bothered me.  The worst thing that bothered me was the beginning of the movie.  The teenagers had banal dialogue.  It seemed like it would be one silly thrill after another.  The beginning of the movie seemed like it belonged on a home video.  It began in a rather awkward way. I'm used to being lured into a movie, just a little.The hair color was pretty annoying.  And the young boy under Naomi Watts charge most of the time was spooky.  The kid was innocent and good, yet scary?  I don't get it.  But I definitely did not want some sensitive Haley Joel Osmet.  So, overall, I didn't get what I wanted, no matter if the kid was different.Then there was the video.  Watts' character is disturbed, but not her video geek friend?  Not convincing that the video is horribly seductively scary. And the whole thing about the drawings.  Too Sixth Sense.  And the teacher's comment about the cousin being dead a week ago and not three days ago. What was the point of that?Here is what I did like.  I was quite disturbed the whole film.  I kept getting jerked around to believe different things, the way the characters would.  And my eyes were big as saucers by the end of the movie as if I had watched the disturbing video and was about to die myself.  I didn't scream once, but can say I had a deep soul horror, the kind that says, oh my, I hope not, really.  The black and white dull cinematography was great.  The unexplained yet, to me, logical parts of the plot I loved.  To me, when it worked, the unexplained was the wonderfully, deeply understood.I loved how the movie commented on how things spread in a community by the use of curiosity and mystery.  There was no cover or label for the bad video.I enjoyed the image of the tree.  I was not disturbed by the mirrors.  The well was very Old World looking, therefore quite cursed looking, as if Britain, land of the legend and the paranormal was about to invade the U.S.I found the movie flawed, yet compelling to watch.  It was not what you call seamless, but jerky for mystery, thrills, and some disturbing thoughts that are keeping the lights on tonight.My rating: 3/5 (for overall disturbing effect on me)SPOILER AHEAD:  DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIEI hated the end.  We were supposed to draw conclusions from the dialogue between Watts' character and little scary boy?  I had no idea what they meant.  Did they go evil?  What would they do with the copy of the tape? What about the showing of the dark-haired girl going up the lift after Watts' character sees her friend is horrifically and unexpectedly dead? Did that mean knowledge?  Did blond mean no knowledge or innocence and dark hair mean knowledge?  That didn't even hold up the whole film.  And I didn't like the video girl stepping out of the screen.  Please kill me and get it over with, like the poor characters in the movie.  That is so contrived, so bottle-blond.  And how do I believe that the scary little boy would aid his mother in learning about the poor poor dead girl when he knew she was evil all along if he was actually good though weird?  Mind tricks?  Come on.",6,0,0,20 March 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," human element of film good; didn't like as much as first
","I went to this movie in anticipation of an intense three hours.  But I made a major miscalculation.  I thought reading the book would make me enjoy the film more.  It did not.  I found myself annoyed by what Jackson did to parts of the plot.  When I saw the first movie, I was emotionally sucked in because I had a space of a year between the reading of the book and the viewing of the film.  This time, I viewed things with an incredibly critical eye.  I didn't like what he did to Aragorn in part of the film, seeing it as unnecessary.  I thought that Arwen was portrayed in an inconsistent, unjust manner.  I remembered what was in the book about the battle scenes at Helm's Deep.  I was immediately annoyed by Jackson's frills and the overly sentimental attachment to the roles certain characters played in the battle. I also did not quite like the way he cuts back and forth between the first half of the book and the second half.  I like that he does, because it is necessary, but some skill is lacking in the methods used and the pacing, causing some parts of the film to drag and take on a dull quality.  I don't like how the end of the battle at Helm's Deep is signified in the film, thinking there was better perspective and handling of it in the book.I did like the human element.  I loved how Gollum, Merry, and Pippin were turned into stars.  Merry and Pippin were given especially delightful roles. I loved their interaction the the ents.  I loved Gollum's speeches.  I love how the environmental themes Tolkein would have loved brought out were treated.  I loved the simplicity with which Wormtongue's, Theoden's, and Eowyn's starting situation and relationships to each other were treated. I liked the use of monologues by certain characters.  I disliked but found necessary the behind the scenes psychology of the battle of Helm's Deep. Somehow, sentimentality got hold of it too much.  But I greatly admired Jackson's very human treatment of all the characters in that situation, and the way he effectively shows the attitudes of those in peril.  I admired his attempt to socially and psychologically comment on what was going on.  It made a lot of sense even if I didn't find all of it artistically pleasing enough.I thought some of the great strengths of the film were in the acting, monologues, and highlighting of Merry and Pippin and Gollum.  I loved how Frodo is shown in relationship to Gollum and the shots used to clearly, eeerily, and humanly compare the two.   The clear storytelling focus really worked for me.And as annoyed as some people are by the ending, I found it well done and a great way to wrap up the movie, make up for flaws, and really make you want to see number three.A major flaw of this movie is the forced and ineffective music, obviously intended to get you.  But it didn't get me this time.  It was as bad as the watered down root beer I was drinking.  Another annoyance is Gollum's voice. I didn't think it was quite right.I have a reservation about the title.  'The Two Towers' as a title does not hold up well thematically for the film because of the information the viewer is not given.  It is better justified in the book, though still just barely. This has nothing to do with politics, but the fact that I feel it is too incompletely justified in the film and the book itself could have had a better title.  I have to say this, though.  The title gives nothing away.Overall, by the end, this film is a lot of fun and thought-provoking, despite my reservations.  It was definitely fun for me to think about and discuss with others.  I give Jackson points for pulling off anything having to do with these long novels as well as he did.",8,0,0,20 March 2003
