The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," War Comes to PANEM - 'If we burn, you burn with us' Katniss Everdeen
","Katniss is now in District 13 where she is finding life increasingly difficult. The Rebel leaders want her to step up as the 'face' of the Rebellion - the 'Mockingjay' that the people of Panem have seen arena, but she is not in any mental condition to agree to this wish. In addition, the Capitol have now used Peeta in Propaganda media to tell the Rebels to lay down their arms. Katniss is suffering from PTSD and is confused. She refuses to play the 'Mockingjay' but Plutarch suggests that she be shown the ruins of her old District - 12 - during which Gale recounts what happened after the events in the arena - and the thousands that died in the firebombing. She reluctantly changes her mind and has a 'Propo' Team assigned to capture media shots for propaganda use. As the Districts flare up in open rebellion, Katniss goes to District 8, where she witnesses the effect she has on the people fighting - also the ruthlessness of Snow. Katniss also worries that, if Peeta does not succeed in bringing the rebels to the table, he will be executed, so forces the Rebel President - Alma Coin - to attempt a rescue of Peeta and the other remaining Victors held in the Capitol...
Of all the Films in this series, 'Mockingjay - Part 1' is consistently the one least liked - some people were critical of a 'Cash Grab' by the studio and of splitting the final Book into two Films. Having watched these many times, I have been a little perplexed as to how some people view them. Too many got caught up in the 'Games Arena' aspect of the first two and really just wanted a nice little simple jog to the finish with lots of explosions and action. But the author deliberately moved away from the 'Games' for the finale of the series.
I am very pleased that the filmmakers DIDN'T do this. Why? Firstly, 'Mockingjay' as a SINGLE Film would have been over 4 hours long - if cut, it would have lost all of the subtle character-driven scenes that make this story so gripping. But I believe that would have been a mistake. This entire story is about WAR - loss, sacrifice, trauma, death - the price of Rebellion. It is as well that 'Mockingjay - Part 1' IS a standalone film as it is the most gloomy, melancholy and devastating film of the series. It pulls no punches. It's 'Hero' - Katniss - begins the Film suffering a nervous breakdown (no 'superhero' nonsense here) and, subsequently, goes to see what has been done to District 12. She views the rubble and the blackened corpses in horror, collapsing to her knees as Gale tells her how he tried to save as many as he could from the capitol's firebombs. She returns to tell the Rebel Leader - Alma Coin - she will be the 'Mockingjay'. The scenes in District 8, where she visits the Field Hospital, are bloody and realistic. Bodies lying in corridors, badly wounded being treated on floors with rudimentary medical supplies and the stares of people suffering from the trauma of war. It is also where she is recognised. It is a lovely scene as slowly the whole room realise she is there....it is also where Katniss begins to recognise what she is to the Rebellion - Hope - a figure that took on the Capitol - and won. The stunned look on Lawrence's face is perfect - at last she is coming to terms with her role in all of this. She may never have wanted 'any of this' but she is now so deeply part of the Rebellion she cannot go back. Unfortunately, Snow knows she is there and despatches bombers - ordering them to target the Hospital. Katniss watches as the Hospital is utterly destroyed and, in rage, she and Gale, rush to a rooftop where the two Hovercraft are hit by them as they pass on a firing on - and crash in flames. Again, there are no punches pulled - Katniss - still enraged - shouts to Snow via her 'propo' Team 'If we burn, you burn with us'.
Later, while out with her 'Team', she stops in a quarry and is asked to sing. The melancholy song she chooses - 'The Hanging Tree' - sums up everything she feels. As she sings the scene cuts to a desperate 'human wave' attack by the people of District 7, trying to place explosives to destroy the Capitol's hydro-dams, source of power for the Capitol. Unarmed and simply absorbing bullets with flesh, the scene is simply stunning - no childish happy endings, no bullet-proof suits - just death for ordinary people. THIS is what it means to Rebel and fight oppression - and once again, 'Mockingjay' does this unflinchingly. It's depiction of a savage war, even though aimed at young adults, is extremely well done.
Meanwhile the Capitol continues to use Peeta to send messages to the Rebels - Katniss knows it is only a matter of time before Peeta is killed. Some have said that the 'romance' between the two is not realistic - but I differ from that. Katniss did NOT love Peeta immediately but gets to love him through the dreadful series of events they are forced to go through.
With the attacks on the Dams successful and with the power out, Coin sends a Team in by Hovercraft to retrieve Peeta and the others. Gale volunteers to go. It all seems far too easy as the Team penetrates the building and gets Peeta out. However, as they return the power comes back up - but they are not engaged and are allowed to return safely. Katniss is informed of the rescue but it is plain later as to why they were allowed to escape - Peeta has been completely 'brainwashed' by the Capitol - they have focussed all of his anger on Katniss and, when he sees her, he tries immediately to kill her. Katniss is only saved by the rifle butt of Boggs, the Rebel commander. The Film ends with Katniss, hardly able to speak and in a neck-brace looking with horror through a window at Peeta - who has had to be restrained as he is going berserk.
Firstly, the performance of Jennifer Lawrence is amazing - she carries this Film on her shoulders and does a fabulous job of portraying the tumult of emotions that the central character is going through. Likewise, Josh Hutcherson as Peeta has to step up in the acting stakes as his Character is also slowly being ripped apart and he does a great job of showing this disintegration.
At this point I should mention the superbly understated music by James Newton Howard. It is a very emotional score, the centrepiece of which is 'The Hanging Tree', which begins with just Lawrence's solo voice but slowly builds to a massive crescendo during the Dams attack.
Both Mockingjay - Part 1 and Part 2' - were shot at the same time. The second and concluding Part has a slightly different feel to it - Katniss is more mature, worldly-wise and even cynical.
Mockingjay - Part 1 may not be everyone's idea of a good time - it is an extremely dark Film in a series that needed to show the consequences of what happened in the first two Films. It is this Film which actually sets it apart from the other 'Young Adult' Film series that were released - none are as dark as this. Serious themes run all through the 'Hunger Games' series but never have these been more apparent than in this Film.
In a strange example of life imitating Art, some showings of 'Mockingjay - Part 1' were cancelled in Thailand when protestors began using the Rebels 'Three finger salute' when demonstrating against its Military Government!!
'Mockingjay - Part 2' will conclude the 'Hunger Games' story - in a melancholy and bittersweet way.",8,1,1,29 April 2020
The Hunger Games," Trauma - Rebellion - War - the Tragedy of Katniss Everdeen - a REAL Hero
","Sometime in the future PANEM - what is left of North America - has survived some dreadful catastrophe. It has organised itself into a dozen Districts that provide the resources to a central 'Capitol' run by the ruthless President Snow. We learn that the Districts rebelled against the Capitol in the past but failed - and must now pay the penalty. Every year, each District must provide 2 Tributes - one Male One Female between the ages of 12 - 18 to take part in 'The Hunger Games' - a televised event that allows just ONE victor to survive the ordeal. In District 12 - the Mining District - they have only had one winner during the previous 73 Games. Names will be selected by drawing lots and today - the 74th Games - will be the first time for Primrose Everdeen. Her Sister, Katniss, has already been through several 'Reapings' and reassures her that she will be OK. Katniss is a loner - she hunts/poaches on the fringe of her District and loves the woods and natural outdoor life. She is highly proficient with a Bow and uses it to bring much needed extra food to her Family. At a market she is given a little badge featuring a 'Mockingjay' bird - something that will in the future become indelibly linked to her. At the Reaping it is Primrose's name that is called out - the only way to save her is to 'volunteer' as Tribute - which Katniss selflessly does - and joins the other 'successful' candidate - Peeta Mellark to journey to the Capitol to be trained to fight in the Games. Both Katniss and Peeta realise their chances of survival are slim to none. Haymitch Abernathy, the only previous District 12 winner is now their 'Mentor' on how to play this 'game'. He tells Katniss she needs to learn how to make 'allies' of other tributes - something alien to her nature. But the other Districts also have Tributes that are better trained and more ruthless than the two District 12 trainees.
This is the basic set-up for the first Film in the Series and, having watched it again recently, it has shown itself to be an exceptionally well-made cinematic piece. This Film Series - based on the hugely successful novels by Suzanne Collins - is still the very best of the so-called 'Young Adult' spate of novels and Films that appeared in the 2010's. The 'Maze Runner' and the 'Divergent' Series all owe their basic DNA to this series. Why then is the 'Hunger Games' so effective?
Firstly, a lot of people have compared 'The Hunger Games' to Fukasaku's Japanese Film 'Battle Royale' - which is a mistake. The two Films are very much products of their respective cultures. The irony is that 'Battle Royale' (the central idea of which is of an entire School Class having to fight each other to the death) was made SO explicitly violent and bloody that the Film could not be seen by the very audience the Director wanted to tap into (15+)!! Also, as we will see, 'The Hunger Games' really isn't about the 'Games' at all - it is about war - and the price some generations have to pay to fight oppression.
The Film makers of the 'Hunger Games' did NOT make that mistake. Collins made it clear that these novels were aimed at a 'Young Adult' (YA) audience and Director Gary Ross and the Producers ultimately made a Film that COULD be seen by these 12 to 15 year olds. This is an important point to make as the approach to this Film is actually very subtle - the violence is never glorified or unnecessary. They could have gone and made a VERY different Film but decided on realistic and sympathetic ideal that allowed ALL ages to see the film through the eyes of the main Protagonist - Katniss Everdeen. The vast majority of the film is seen through Katniss' point of view - she is a simple, cold, taciturn, stubborn and loyal individual, who simply wants to ensure the survival of her Sister and Family. The Capitol - and all of it's 'pleasures' make absolutely no impression on her at all. As she matures through the entire tale, Katniss's niave view of the world starts to disintegrate - she is a pawn, being used and played by many other people - it is her humanity and courage that others wish to exploit.
The design of the Film is exceptionally well done as it contrasts the poverty of the Districts with the super wealth (and indifference) of the citizens of the Capitol. The opening shots of District 12 - people shuffling mindlessly along - destitute and starving - remind one of scenes from the Great Depression and 'The Grapes of Wrath' - no doubt the intention of Director Gary Ross. This is contrasted with the overblown Fashion of the Capitol, where every accessory, whether it is clothing, hair or make up, is taken to the extreme.
The Main Characters and their Cast too are well done - and all will have their own journeys to make. Jennifer Lawrence plays Katniss to the hilt and cemented her reputation as a leading Actress. The sheer confusion she exhibits - a stranger in a strange land - is very well executed. Her Character will be dealt blow after blow, exploited and betrayed. In a very real sense she IS this story - she states truthfully 'I never wanted any of this' - but events will overtake her.
Josh Hutcherson's Peeta Mellark is the underdog - and very much 2nd fiddle to Katniss - a difficult role to play but his humanity and gentle soul are things that Katniss can identify with. Liam Hemsworth's Gale Hawthorne is Katniss's boyfriend - left behind in 12 when she leaves for the Capitol. They have grown up together but events will twist this relationship.
Effie Trinket is the epitome of the Capitol's ideals in Fashion and outlook. Dressed as if she has to be a performance all day long, Elizabeth Banks nails her character so that at once we are appalled by her insensitivities but also recognise that she does have a moral compass - something that will be tested by the events to come.
The pivotal role of Mentor Haymitch Abernathy - Woody Harrelson - is another who will run the gauntlet of change. Cynical, alcoholic and acerbic, he is the ONLY other District 12 winner and has spent decades mentoring and waving young people off to their deaths. He can no longer see any chance of success - until he encounters Katniss. It is a love/hate relationship - she is as direct as him, so sparks will fly. But there is also respect.
The lurking, menacing presence of President Coriolanus Snow is superbly portrayed by veteran Donald Sutherland. This is a highly nuanced performance by Sutherland - his villain is deadly because he thinks, exploits and ruthlessly does what he has to maintain his power - and the status quo. His quiet monologues are dripping with threat.
'The Hunger Games' introduces us to this world and revels in the excitement and thrill of watching the 'Games' - it lulls the audience into looking at the Hunger Games exactly as the people in the capitol do - as an audience thrill spectacle - getting swept up in the hype, glamour, Fashion, and the excitement of betting and watching young people die. This is then balanced by the view of Katniss - watching young people die at first hand and feeling the fear of imminent death. Katniss is not a 'superhero' - she is frequently confused, traumatised and bested in combat. She is flawed, stubborn and courageous. Her friendship with one of the youngest Tributes - Rue - shows that she has heart and it is the brutal end of this friendship that will spark the events outside the Games arena. Rue is hit be a spear thrown by another player - Katniss almost in reflex shoots him down with an arrow - but then realises that Rue is dying. Instead of merely thinking about her own safety, Katniss now holds Rue gently until she dies - a heart-rending scene as Katniss cries her heart out - something being witnessed by Rue's Home District on big Monitors. Katniss delicately builds Rue a bed of flowers and then turns to one of the many hidden cameras and raises her hand in the 'upturned three finger' salute of defiance. District 11 explodes into violence. Katniss is unaware of what her simple actions have triggered, but it is the catalyst that will drive the increasing tensions across Panem.
Katniss shows herself a REAL Hero, not one with superpowers, armour or other such affectations - she is fighting for her Family, trying to do the decent thing and just to survive. Even at the end where only Peeta and her remain, she would rather eat poisoned berries with Peeta - with both dying - than kill Peeta just to 'win'. Here is indeed something 'heroic' and the thing that made Katniss a role for so many young people from both the books and Films. The Capitol's 'Gamemaker' now has to make a decision - let them both die (no winner at all) or let them both live to ensure a 'hopeful' conclusion. He chooses the latter - a fateful one for him as Snow sees this as a total failure of the system.
The series will continue and it is in the sequel 'Catching Fire' that we realise that this is NOT about the 'Games' at all - it is about what they represent and the longing of people to fight oppression.
'The Hunger Games' has its detractors - some say it 'tones down' the violence to make it appeal to a younger audience (and ensure they can actually see it!) - that is correct but it makes it a much better film for it. If doesn't glorify or linger on the deaths. What the Film DOES do is show a young girl battling odds in a dreadful world. It shows the pain, death, and rage of those who are forced to live by this code. For it is the young people who always have to face up to this. In the subsequent Films Katniss will see her world explode in violence, Rebellion and War. Sacrifices will have to be made, people die, populations decimated and Katniss will be damaged like everyone else. As Alma Coin will say much later 'There is no victory without sacrifice' - indeed - and it is as well to show young people what that actually means.",9,1,2,19 April 2020
The Day After Tomorrow," An enjoyable 'Disaster' Film with some nice set pieces
","This Film harkens back to the old 70's Disaster flicks - taking situations and just magnifying them 1000 fold for entertainment sake. Yes, the Science here is questionable (apart from the effects of the currents being disrupted!) - it is all in the service of a storyline. The weather systems across the entire Planet are thrown into chaos by 'climate change' and it is up to Paleo-climatologist Dennis Quaid to convince all that the unthinkable is going to happen - while at the same time trying to re-bond with his estranged son - Jake Gyllenhal. All of this is hardly new but this Film does it with great dash and with a few great set pieces - the inundation of New York is superbly done and the characters are allowed to develop in quite a natural way. Unlike many of Emmerich's film (which I find overblown) this one he approaches in a more serious manner - the opening shots of Antarctica set the scene extremely well and the accompanying score by Harold Kloser is actually very haunting. All in all, an enjoyable film with some very nice performances.",7,3,3,30 April 2020
Alien," ALIEN - Ridley Scott's Gothic Masterpiece
","It is quite a few years since I first sat down to watch 'Alien', my anticipations being that it would be like any other Sci-Fi film of the period. To say that this film changed my life may be a slight overstatement but it certainly changed the way I view Film and Cinema! The opening titles (accompanied by Jerry Goldsmith's thoroughly creepy score) give the tone of what is to come. The crew of a commercial star freighter are awakened by their onboard computer as it has picked up a 'signal' from a small planetoid in a nearby system. Obliged by Company Rules to investigate, they set down and find a completely non-human ship crashed and (apparently) derelict. One of the crew descends into the bowels of the ship - to be confronted by a chamber full of ovoid shapes...unwisely he decides to take a closer look...and things spiral out of control from that point....What makes this Film SO great is that it is almost shot in a semi-documentary style - the shaky camera footage on the helmet cams, the dark foreboding atmosphere and the quite slow pace - all are deliberately and slowly drawing the audience in. Alien sometimes comes close to being a 'Science Fiction Art-Film' - and so it is - in a way. The designs are extraordinary - with Swiss Artist H.R. Giger designing the absolutely frightening ALIEN of the title. Scott's visuals are astounding and introduced him to Hollywood as a real talent. The pace picks up through the second half of the film - the effects were all done 'in camera' - no CGI here - just old fashioned film making. Scott ensures you never quite see the creature, which adds to the menace and sense that you are trapped in there with it. The sequence in the air shafts is superb - a gripping piece of cinema, as is Alien's most celebrated scene - the 'birth' of the monster.We tend to forget now that, back in 1979, it was not the norm to have a 'female hero' - Scott deliberately went and made 'Ripley' a female to set against audience expectations - thus when Captain Dallas falls, the audience were now wondering what to expect. Everything about this production is first rate and Ridley Scott has never really been better (unless you compare with Blade Runner). Sigourney Weaver - a then unknown - shows that strong female leads are the future.
It is difficult to underestimate the impact of this Film on Science Fiction in general - this really WAS the first time that a Sci-Fi Film was shot, designed and delivered in a totally realistic way - which is why audiences believed it and were scared to hell. This Film so impressed me that I started to watch other Genres, older cinema - it gave me the 'gateway' into the history of Film. It will forever be may most treasured cinematic experience...If you have never seen this - prepare to shocked, scared and blown away with some of the most stunning visuals in this Genre.",10,2,3,16 May 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," The Skywalker saga comes to an end - of sorts
","I have just seen Episode IX and it was a mixed bag of emotions, SFX and dramatic scenes. I remember seeing the original Star Wars a long time ago in a Galaxy far far away (1977) and all of the subsequent films. The issues with THIS Trilogy is that it is a LONG time after the originals, so it had to bring something 'fresh' while not losing sight of the huge Fan-base of older SW lovers. After the criticism levelled at 'last Jedi', it was clear that a huge effort was needed to bring the Saga back on course for the Finale. By and large, JJ Abrams and his Team managed to put a half decent film together which fully reflects our current generation, superb SFX, huge nods to both the past films and a deliberate attempt to correct some of the issues with LJ. It also suffers from things that lots of current Films do - poor writing, poor character development, poor plotting and a real sense that we have seen half of this before. If you are a real Star Wars purist, then the fact that this entire new Trilogy 'dispenses' with Anakin Skywalker COMPLETELY indicates that the people making these have missed a major point! It is easy to criticise the makers for NOT continuing the mythology BUT a nod would have been in order. On the plus side, both Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley give it their all - despite some uninspired dialogue by the writers - and their ARE some genuine moments of emotion and farewell. Despite the flaws, 'Rise of Skywalker' does a pretty good job of seeing out the 'Disney Trilogy', while not quite achieving that for the Saga as a whole.",6,2,5,19 December 2019
Avatar," Cameron's Magnum Opus - More relevant today than ever...
","It is 11 years since James Cameron brought AVATAR to cinema screens, where it proved to be one of the most stunning releases (and most successful) Films of all time. So why have I chosen to write a Review of it now? Well, a belated Sequel will arrive next year and in the decade or so since this Film's release it seems the message of the Filmmaker appears to have been largely ignored by the very people who needed to understand it!
The premise is simple - Mankind have now colonised a new world - 'Pandora' - a largely unspoilt and staggeringly beautiful world in which mankind have a small base. Also living on Pandora are the indigenous people (the na'vi') and a plethora of wildlife. Unfortunately, the Human presence is a 'Commercial' enterprise with a large Military capability that sees Pandora as nothing more than yet another place to exploit for rare minerals and therefore expendable.
A Scientific Programme has been set up in the hope of 'persuading' the Na'vi to let the human contingent mine where they want by moving out of the way. The Programme uses 'Avatars' - humans that are transported into 'na'vi bodies - to help them study and convert the locals. Enter Jake Sully, a young ex-marine in a wheelchair, whose twin Brother was on the Programme until murdered. Initially meeting scepticism and derision from the other Scientists, Sully slowly begins to realise what is really at stake on Pandora - and that he will have to make a momentous decision - who or what - to fight for?
The Film astounded audiences back in 2009 as it's Special Effects were SO far ahead of anything else. Even 11 years later they are still spectacular (and in my opinion superior to most recent Sci-Fi releases). The Pandorian world and ecosystem is designed and shown in HUGE depth, Scientifically thought out and spectacularly brought to life on the screen. But this is not just a gorgeous cinematic eye-fest - the motion Capture of the na'vi actors ensures that they are brought to life in a graceful and realistic manner. This is vital for the Film's central Drama - when WE begin to destroy environments that do not belong to us, who do we decide is right - or wrong? James Cameron has always loved 'hard wear' - and it is in AVATAR in abundance - the Humans are the ones in metal, plastic and armed to the teeth. The na'vi are in absolute harmony with their ecosystem and world - all of their culture is naturalistic - textiles, wood and other plant materials. They even ride some of the creatures symbiotically- especially the flying 'Dragons'. Even their religious and sacred beliefs are totally bound to the ecology.
All of this shows that Cameron is making a statement - we as the audience KNOW we should want the Humans in the Film to be noble, moral and empathetic - but they mostly come across as anything but. The na'vi are the ones that evoke our reaction - they are courageous, noble, sincere and generous. It is not long before the na'vi are forced to battle for their own world, with the Scientific Team and Jake Sully forced to choose a side.
Of course, this is a direct mirror of what we have done to our own planet - Global Warming, Climate Change, destruction of rainforest, ruthless pillaging of natural resources and dumping of waste and pollution. There were many people who didn't like the message that Cameron and AVATAR presented and I have read some of the reviews here .
This Film is a landmark of Science Fiction - a genre that has consistently been ignored by 'serious' Film Critics. Yet, AVATAR's message was - and remains - a very serious one. We destroy the natural world at our peril and, in the decade since it's original release, this message is even MORE relevant now.
The Film was recently surpassed by 'Avengers: Endgame' as the top-grosser BUT AVATAR remains the FAR superior Film. James Cameron's passion for this project - and the issues it highlights - are there on the screen for audiences to see. Even a decade later this remains a glorious landmark for the Genre - and a timely warning for us all of what we could lose...",9,0,0,10 March 2020
Prometheus," In an 'Alien' Universe but NOT Alien!
","When Scott announced that he was making a 'Prequel' I was initially concerned that he would make the mistake of making an 'Alien 2 hybrid'. The fact is that the original Alien from 1979 is now such a Sci-Fi classic that to dare to tread down that path is asking for trouble! The astute James Cameron in his sequel (Aliens 1986) steered WELL clear of even attempting to match Scott's style and visuals and the other Films in the franchise did not fare well (for various reasons). With 'Prometheus' Scott decided NOT to make it a direct 'Alien' film but approach it from a from a fresh angle. Concentrating on the 'Engineers' (Space Jockey) from the first film, Scott and the writers posit a very different take on Human origins. Firstly, the Science here is pretty flawed (Evolution is side lined in favour of a more 'cosmic' origin!) However, this IS Science FICTION.... A pair of Scientists Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and her partner convince billionaire Peter Weyland (Guy Pierce) that they have found illustrations from ancient sites around the world pointing to an extra terrestrial visitation and that they have identified the System where these aliens came from. The 'Prometheus' ship is dispatched to this system to investigate with an eclectic mixture of Scientists, security - and Company persons. Even from an early stage it is clear that the 'Company' may NOT have the same goals in mind as the Scientists. On board also is 'David' - a synthetic human - a creation of Weyland's, who very quickly demonstrates that he may have is OWN Agenda for the Mission. Michael Fassbender's performance is excellent - David has a nasty ambiguity to him - at once servile but almost arrogant and condescending. Noomi Rapace's Elizabeth Shaw is the Scientist who still retains her 'faith' - and it is this combination that drives her to look for our 'Creators'.
The early scenes as the Prometheus reach the planetoid are beautifully done and there is a real sense that the 'Mission' will go badly wrong....It does.
Now, many Alien fans complained that they 'never see THE Alien' and didn't get this story at all. MY take is that this Film is all the better for NOT having H.R Giger's now famous creation. Yes, there are many elements that really could have been better - the characters behave in irrational ways - sometimes stupidly - and the Science isn't really thought-through. However, to those who state 'the characters are not rational' maybe they should read up on some expeditions (Scientific ones!) that took place in the 19th and 20th Centuries (including that of Captain Scott in the Antarctic!) where, frankly, the whole enterprise was not only flawed but badly planned and irrational from the off!
My overall impression of 'Prometheus' is that visually it delivers and some of the acting - notably Fassbender and Rapace - is actually good. The Story is passable and well-delivered. It DOES tie-in to the 'Alien Universe' and only at the very end does it give this away implicitly. However, I found it different enough from the original Alien (gothic-horror sci-fi) for me to enjoy it.
However, the story of 'Prometheus' doesn't really end here....it was clear that many people that saw 'Prometheus' PREFERRED it's newer storyline to the 'Alien-centric one'. In effect, it created a split fan base, one side wanting more of the 'Prometheus-story' - the other side were the die-hard 'Alien fans' who complained that there 'wasn't an Alien in it' or 'it was not at all like Alien'.
These same persons continued to state this view and, in my opinion, it was THIS that caused the follow-up to this Film - 'Alien Covenant' - to be such a MESS. Scott ( and the studio) unwisely decided to listen to the 'we want more Aliens' comments and this resulted in the entire 'Covenant' Film being nothing more than a patchwork of 'Reboot scenes' from earlier Alien Films. The sad fact is that the 'Alien' creature is now so well known (after 40 years of coverage) that it has actually LOST it's shock value and mystery. People who declared they wanted to see more of the Alien merely pushed the filmmakers into that dangerous area where you try to revive the 'original' 1979 film by imitating it but also try and integrate the newer story elements. The result was a Film that NEITHER set of fans actually liked at all and was completely unsatisfying. So much of the interesting parts of 'Prometheus' were simply 'thrown away' so that 'Fans' could be given 'what they asked for'. The irony here is that 'Alien Covenant' was so badly received that the entire franchise now looks unlikely to be finished.
As for 'Prometheus' - I think it is a far superior Film to 'Alien Covenant' and, for all of it's faults, was the right way to go.",8,0,2,9 June 2019
Paths of Glory," Kubrick's Masterpiece on the utter folly and horror of war
","Very few Films have ever quite captured the true misery and horrors of the First World War. Having studied Military History, I had always imagined the I would never see a film that would portray the awful conditions, the sheer waste of mens lives and the terror of a n attack by Infantry against machine guns and artillery. Then, I saw Kubrick's 'Paths of Glory' and sat stunned through a film that avoids the usual Hollywood 'heroics' and shows us the 'human' side of this conflict - from the French High Command, most of whose Officers are drawn from the wealthy classes - and who hardly care about the scale of the casualties, Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas) an Officer who deeply cares about his men and who doesn't wish to expose them to unnecessary danger, to the ordinary soldiers - just carrying out their duty - and trying to come out alive. Shot in Black and White, which really gives and authentic look to the trenches, Kubrick's tracking shots as the Officers walk down the trenches hoping to 'spread morale', show you the soldiers 'eye-view' - with incessant shell-fire throughout. What makes 'Paths Of Glory' such a powerful film is the sheer idiocy - and almost childish - reactions of the most senior French Officers. The Court Martial scene shows this more than anywhere else - the 'verdict' has already been decided and, as such, the Court is a farce, simply there to verify the wishes of the Commanding Officer.
The main attack against the 'Ant Hill' is one of the most brilliant, and accurate, depictions of such an assault in the First World War. All through the film the 'enemy' are never seen - not a single German Soldier is ever shown. The Irony being that the final scene, where the French troops are drinking and singing before returning to the front, shows a frightened German girl, who is forced to sing for the Troops. As she slowly, and faltering, sings a sad, melancholy, song from home, the troops stop their initial hostility and begin to hum along - painfully aware that soon, they too will return to the hell of the trenches.
Kubrick's film is one of the very best Films about any war and is amongst my favourite films of all time. Highly recommended",9,0,1,4 May 2019
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," 'The Games are just Games Miss Everdeen - did you want War'? President Snow
","Katniss and Peeta have survived the 74th Hunger Games but their method of doing so has angered the powers in the Capitol - especially President Snow. Both Katniss and Peeta had 'pretended' to fall in love in the arena but Snow - and others - are not so easily deceived. While they are preparing to go on the 'Victors Tour' of the Districts, Katniss is shocked to find Snow waiting for her at her home - they both agree not to lie to one another - and Snow points out that her 'defiant' acts in the arena have had consequences. Katniss protests that she 'never wanted any of this' but Snow brutally lays out the real situation - 'The Games are just Games, Miss Everdeen, did you want War?' Katniss agrees to try and convince the Districts that both she and Peeta are very much 'in love' and play the 'Victor' Tour as Snow wants it. However, while on the Tour Katniss witnesses her own 'Mockingjay' symbol - now being used by the rebels in the Districts. When there is a disturbance in District 11 she and Peeta are shocked to see people executed for showing the 'three upraised fingers' of the rebels. By the time the Tour reaches the Capitol, Snow has decided that she is now a liability and should be eliminated. His new Game Maker - Plutarch Heavensbee - convinces Snow that there is a way to do this without suspicion. The 75th Hunger Games - a 'Quarter Quell' will select the Tributes from the previous Victors - thus ensuring that most will be eliminated. Katniss 'volunteers' but Peeta does also to save Haymitch after it is HIS name that is pulled out. Once at the Capitol it is clear that the other 'Victors' are as bitter and angry as Katniss & Peeta, especially Johanna Mason, and it is also clear that something else is afoot. As Katniss and Peeta go into the arena for a second time, nothing is what it seems.
Unbeknown to Katniss and Peeta, most of the Victors are playing a different 'game'. She and Peeta have allied themselves to Beetee and wiress, people who won through brains and not physical strength. Beetee hatches a plan to electrocute the remaining hostiles by harnessing the lightning strikes from a tall tree. Katniss and Johanna make for the beach but before they get far Johanna knocks Katniss out and removes her 'tracker'. As Finnick runs calling her name, Katniss thinks only of Peeta and returns to the tree but finds Beetee unconscious and Finnick approaching - she levels her bow - the watching President Snow urges her to let it fly. However, Finnick says to Katniss 'Remember who the real enemy is' and, in slight confusion she lowers the bow from Finnick but attaches the cable and - when the Lightning strikes again - launches her arrow high up to the dome covering the arena. The enormous power shorts out all the cameras and screens as the dome begins to fall apart above their heads. A hovercraft picks up a barely conscious Katniss as parts of the dome still collapse past her. She later wakes to find Haymitch, Finnick and Plutarch all announcing that she has been rescued as she is the symbol of the Rebellion. She is aghast to find that Peeta and Johanna have been captured back in the arena. Later, there is more heartbreak as Gale tells her that District 12 has been utterly destroyed and that they are on their way to District 13 to continue the fight....
'Catching Fire' is one of the very best Sequels and it does this because it changes very little from the first film. Gary Ross hands the reins to new director Francis Lawrence, who knows better than to tamper with the design, and look (and Cast!) of the Film. Again, we as the audience, get to look at the Games as we did the first BUT this time we are NOT enjoying any of it. The 'Victor's are angry and mostly rebellious, the interviews that Caesar Flickerman tries to glitz up fail completely until we are again facing the Arena. Katniss has been truly an 'innocent' through all of the events but she is now suspecting that her influence beyond the Games may be higher than she thought. This second film as darker than the original, the sequence where Katniss hears the voice of her Sister, Prim, screaming in flocks of birds, leaves her shocked and traumatised. We feel through the second half of the film that things are heading out of control - and so they are.
Again, Jennifer Lawrence plays Katniss superbly - confused, dazed, angry betrayed - it takes a lot to do this but Lawrence always makes her character feel real. This is no superhero, just a girl trying to survive and understand. The other cast members do well - the late, great Philip Seymour Hoffmann in his last role plays Plutarch, Sutherland oozes menace as Snow and both Sam Claflin and Jena Malone imbue their 'victors' with believable angst and pathos.
What 'Catching Fire' does is pull the rug from under the audience - this will be the LAST time we will see a 'Hunger Games' arena - as I said in my review of the first film - the Games are not the point - it is Rebellion and War that are now apparent. Both the books - and the Films - show what sometimes must be done to keep basic values - freedom from oppression, the freedom to speak and even think. All through the Film there are sacrifices made by people, just to ensure that there is hope - Cinna in the Capitol and many of the victors, to get Katniss out.
'Catching Fire' leaves behind the 'Games', arena's, the glitz and the glamour, the fashion - it's all gone - because now the Rebellion has started and war has come to Panem again.
The series will continue with 'Mockingjay - Part 1' - a dark and gloomy Film that I think was justified in being apart from the finale. Yes, there will be no more innocent Katniss as she will realise what has been done - and what now needs to happen. She will have to become the 'Mockingjay' for real - and more sacrifices will have to be made.
I appreciate 'Catching Fire' more with each viewing. I watched this with my Teenage Daughter recently and she was truly stunned with what happened. 'Oh God, what happens now?' she asked. 'War' I said.",9,1,2,26 April 2020
Annihilation," A Real Science Fiction Mood Piece
","Lets face it - Annihilation is a 'love it' - or 'hate it' - kind of Film. If you are looking for spaceships, aliens, explosions etc you had better look elsewhere - this is Sci-Fi in reflective mood (or 'refracted'?). The story - loosely based on the novel - seems simple. A Biology Professor's soldier husband suddenly turns up at their house after being 'missing' for some time. He cannot remember where he's been - or much at all. He collapses and is on his way to Hospital when the ambulance - and all aboard - are taken by armed men. On awakening Lena (Natalie Portman) is told about her husband's 'mission' - into a phenomenon called 'The Shimmer' - by Psychiatrist Dr Ventress (Jennifer Jason Leigh). Despite numerous expeditions into the phenomenon, Lena's husband is the first person ever to return. However, no one is any the wiser as to what the 'Shimmer' is or does. Lena volunteers to join the next group to enter in an effort to find clues as to what it all means. The Group - all Female - is led into the 'Shimmer' by Dr Ventress and things start to get weird almost immediately.This is a real Sci-Fi 'mood piece', indeed almost Art Film. The 'Shimmer' itself is beautifully realised and the whole experience once inside has a strange- dreamlike quality. There are many themes explored within the Film - our attraction to 'self-destruction' - ALL of the characters in the film seem to be 'damaged' to one extent or another and seem only willing to head towards their own self destruction. On the other hand, the 'extra terrestrial' source of the 'Shimmer' is NOT a conventional alien entity as we have seen in countless Sci-Fi films - indeed when Lena is asked 'what it wants'? She replies that it 'may not want anything' - it simply defies our reasoning. The clues that are scattered through the narrative hint that the 'Shimmer' is a giant 'refraction' medium - and whether it is Radio waves - or even DNA - it ALL gets mixed in a huge biological blender.
Some of the images are simply breath taking and the ideas are largely left to you as the audience to decide what is actually going on. 'Annihilation' is one of those Films - a little like 'Arrival' - where you are asked to put your own interpretation on the events. I have watched the film a number of times and, for me, it remains a weirdly hypnotic experience.",8,1,3,21 May 2019
