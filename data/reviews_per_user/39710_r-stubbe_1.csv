Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," another cheap horror
","In the last few years i've seen hundreds of these movies come and go. Cheap horror that lacks excitement, a decent cast and a good script. It must be really easy to make films nowadays cause everyone seems to be doing it. I'm sure there are people who like this type of film, lets call it cult B-movies. But to me it's just a big waste of time and money. The poster looks fantastic, thats probably where all the money went. From the very first frame you get a good sense of where this film is going, absolutely nowhere. I guess it's made with a home or semi-pro camera. (thats how it looks to me) Most of the time thats my cue to sign off. But the trailer i saw seemed promising so i stuck with it. But after 30 minutes i got so bored with the bad acting and the terrible dialog i had to call it quits. What a shame that so many bad directors give the horror genre a bad name. I could have made this film, my 10 year old nephew could have. I don't want to be mean or disrespect the makers of this film, but they made it hard for me not to.",1,3,9,20 July 2012
