It," Wow.
","Bill Skarsgard, was FANTASTIC at the role. He was really great at playing the role of Pennywise. I have been a big fan of Stephen Kings novel. I am really glad that this film impressed me. Can't wait for Chapter 2.

Captain Marvel," Skip it.... it's THAT awful
","This film made a 1 billion dollars at the box office. Also it has the Marvel brand. Just cause of that 2 things makes it good..... well it doesn't. Very dissapinted even without the controversies between media and Brie Larson. It would still fail. The film was suppose to get us Hype for Endgame. But it ended up making people rather nervous if she defeated Thanos. I still think Thor is stronger than her and even, the film was suppose to show us her strengths and weaknesses only it didn't..... like at all. So many plot holes and questions and it make the other films terrible. Just watch Shazam or Wonder Woman, or even anyother strong female lead, like Colombiana, Kill Bill, Humger Games, etc. Movies like those deserve a good rating, movies like this is so uninspired. 1/10 AWFUL",1,38,64,17 July 2019
Us," Was good and bad, but still gets a 7
","So i just watch the film.... and its ok i guess.
There were so many plot holes in this film. And so Manny good things to remember.
Good things: The acting, the score, Jordan Peele directing style. The suspense. The plot twist at the end.
Bad things: Plot holes, the jokes seriously this isnt the MCU where they actually have to make a joke all the time. The common horror elements that they always do in horror films.
And that's that. Overall Jordan Peele did a decent job with the film. Not better than Get out but still i give it 7.",7,2,8,30 March 2019
Spider-Man 2," BRILLIANT
","Love this film and this film is nothing but a masterpiece and I can watch this film all day. Everything they did in this movie was just great. This movie makes you feel like Spider-Man, the consequences, the actions everything Spider-Man saves and does right results a negative to Peter Parker, everything that happens in this movie Peter suffers the consequences something that I want to see in a Spider-Man movie. This movie is what I always wanted to see and this film makes me be the reason why I am a huge fan of this hero. 10/10 Brilliant. We will never get another good live action Spider-Man movie like this.",10,0,9,21 January 2019
Blade," This film made me love Blade
","I am a blade fan because, of this film. Wesley Snipes thank you for making Blade a bad ass. This film was a lot of fun and I just loved seeing this movie how it turn out. Glade this film was R rated since it was that, it didn't make a huge drastic change from the movie. Blade kicked so much ass in the movie it's obviously affectious. Whose ever idea was it to let Wesley Snipes be chosen for Blade and told him to just act bad ass.... deserves a round of a applause. The film was fun fun for a vampire movie, usually some vampire movies are just the same and boring..... but not Blade. I love this film, it was everything Blade was suppose to be. 8/10",8,0,0,16 November 2019
Creed," A great continuation of the story
","Creed is a spin-off of the Rocky franchise but this time focuses on Adonis Creed, Apollo Creed's son. He wants to follow in his father's footsteps and is trained by the Rocky Balboa himself. This movie really goes into the relationship between Creed and Rocky and how they both support each other when they mostly need it. Rocky was a broken man and needed someone like Adonis Creed in his life. You can feel the emotions and the sadness in him in this movie.
Michael B. Jordan is phenomenal as Adonis Creed. He is perfect when doing the boxing scenes and is even better when his character is being developed throughout the movie. And Sylvester Stallone...... he absolutely knocks it out of the park in what may have been his best performance in his career as an actor. Everything he has done in the movie made me feel for him. I felt for both Rocky and Creed. This was like a father and son relationship. With Rocky who doesn't have a son and Adonis someone who doesn't have a dad. It's all incredible to watch and it was worth a good movie like this. 9/10 Loved it.",9,1,1,14 March 2020
Aquaman," It was just...... fine
","The visuals in this movie was phenomenal, the CGI they use in this movie was up to the max in this film, I like Aquaman, but it wasn't great. I don't blame James Wan (He is one of my favorite directors) or Jason Momoa. The writers wrote something so basic, that I couldn't care less but the actions, the times when James Wan directs he puts his actions first and he has done so phenomenal in the film. But even he can't do it justice to much. The film was OK visually and action, and acting is was all good. this isn't James Wan best work but he did the best he can. The invasion is seen a bunch of times and we don't get to see other things other than Arthur Curray, we don't see to much Atlantis or Athlatians, we just see how much the visuals have done through. We only know the invasion of the world again. So basic. But still it was an OK film. 7/10",7,0,2,16 November 2019
Spider-Man 3," I rather watch this film than Homecoming
","Coming with this film. I hated this film a lot, I gave it a 3 then a 4. But when I saw Homecoming (The worst spider-man film to me up to date.) This film is abetter than it was before. All I can say is, that this film deserves more credit. That is why the film is a 7/10 to me. Better film than Homecoming.",7,2,9,21 January 2019

Spider-Man: Homecoming," Awful... Just Awful
","I have no idea why???? this film is so loved by fans. This film is the WORST Spider-Man film to date.
Awful.... Horrendous.... I am not a fan of this.
This was NOT a Spider-Man film, more like an Iron Man 2.0
SPIDER-MAN IS NOT THIS USELESS. AT ALL.
I don't hate Tom Holland for this, as far as I am concerned he a terrific actor. But this film... and what Disney is going for with this character is not what I am looking for.
Just Awful, I am so disappointed. Film overall is a 1/10
Tobey Maguire and heck Andrew Garfield had better films, than this garbage
Sorry... Not Sorry 1/10 at best",1,9,20,23 October 2018
Split," James McAvoy deserves an Oscar
",Seriously James McAvoy deserves and Oscar. I couldnt believe he play a role like this so well. Somone who has a Dissociative Identity Disorder is very terrifying and McAvoy did it well. 9/10,9,1,6,24 December 2018
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," FANTASTIC. PHENOMINAL
","Please go watch this movie please even if you seen it already or saw it already see it again see with your brother your sister mother father family brother, cousins, uncles, aunts, Grandma buy your ticket go this film will not disappoint you I 100% guarantee that . I loved it non said. I think they (Sony) saved the best for last. And for being animated and a PG film, This film is x100 better than homecrap. And this film is a game changer for cinema. The voice actors are spot on, and the critics are right, THE FILM IS THAT DAMN GOOD. 10/10 best animated film I ever seen. The #1 film of 2018. I thought Infinity War was #1, but it all changed when I saw this film. 10/10 best animated film I ever seen. This film is a classic already.",10,4,13,21 December 2018

The Amazing Spider-Man," I like it
",I understand why people don't like the amazing Spider-Man 1 and 2. To me it was an OK reboot. I think it could have been better though. But it tried it best to be what it was. The film deserves some crop and Andrew Garfield did his best with the character. 8/10,8,2,7,4 November 2018

P.S. I like the Crooked Man more than the Nun",9,0,5,26 October 2018
Avengers: Endgame," A good but weak Russo bros MCU film
","Let me say before hand. I love the Russo brothers when they direct a movie. They did the best they can with the four movies they have done before (The Winter Solider, Civil War, Infinity War, and now Endgame). I loved the final battle and it was the most memorable thing I have seen in the theater. To say that this film is impossible to make is an understatement. Endgame did the impossible and made the ending conclusion of the original Avengers, for over 10 years. This made people laugh, cheer, and sob. When I saw this film on opening day I expected to have a happy miracle. There are some MCU films I love and hate. But that doesn't mean I love Marvel. I LOVE Marvel, ever since I was a kid I love the comics, shows and movies when I grew up. I started with Iron Man to now Endgame. But.... I didn't LOVE Endgame, I LIKE IT, but I DON'T LOVE IT. I felt like the Russo brothers didn't have full control in this movie. In Winter Soldiers, Civil War, and Infinity War I saw that they made their movies in their own way and they did it. Peter Quill got back on Earth and for the life of me I don't remember him seeing and recognizing the time he was on Earth, one line, look, or anything where they can see through. But what killed me was the 5 year time jump. WHY??? The MCU really love character development after 5 years. All the film does is show us anything of the off screen development. IT TELLS BUT DOESN'T SHOW. And the jokes aren't made from the Russo's but were probably told to include more jokes, and made sure they were immature. I could go so far. But I won't... I LIKE Endgame, but sadly I don't LOVE it. 8/10",7,0,10,29 April 2019
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Fantastic
","Wow this film succeed, in every way. This reboot film was great. James Franco, and the other actors did the best they could with the film and it succeed and the film is the best thing I have ever seen in the time watching the film. I had fun the film was fun it was an awesome reboot to the film series in my case. 10/10",10,0,5,29 April 2019

The Amazing Spider-Man 2," I really actually like it... sorry.... not sorry
",Yes I know the film had some few flaws. But the film was really good. I really like the film. I enjoyed it a lot than Homecoming. I don't understand why it gets hate. But this film was good and Andrew Garfield was a good Spider-man and did what he do best. 8/10. Sorry not sorry.,7,2,9,2 November 2018
1917," Wow...... Just wow
","Wow. This movie was so damn good. I have no words. The cinematography, acting, all were great. And the action scenes are all in 1 take. That is a big achievement right there. The actors were great in this movie everyone felt like a real soilder in 1917. Which can I say I am glad they did a take in World War 1. So many movies always do the same damn World War 2 story all the time. So I am glad they did World War 1. The film was everything what I wanted it to be. I went in with no hopes but when I started this movie it was from a 0 to the end with a 100. That's a great thing to do in cinema. It was also unpredictable and this movie did do just that. Brilliant movie of 2019. 10/10",10,0,4,1 February 2020
Logan," Phenomenal. Best film of 2017

This film was as good as The Dark knight. By far my favorite superhero film of all time. Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart deserve Oscars and Dafnie Keene deserves the best young actress ever. 10/10 Best film of 2017.",10,7,18,24 December 2018
Avengers: Age of Ultron," SEE PEOPLE MCU DOES HAVE BAD FILMS.

So many things were wrong with this film. I am so disappointed with this film. I was so hyped for this film. And when I saw it... I was so mad and disappointed. Mainly cause of the tone and Ultron himself were the reason's I hate this film.

The Dark Knight," Best Batman movie of all time
","The only best DC film, to this day I enjoy and can't get enough of. I enjoyed this film a lot Christian Bale, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman were awesome. But Heath Ledger was the man for Joker. Seriously I an't get enough of this gut. Every time he was on screen I was happy, he literally stole the show. But all has to be given to Christopher Nolan the best director in my opinion. 10/10 Brilliant DC film.

Saw," BRILLIANT
","I love this movie man. I just love everything about it. Not only does this movie create an extremely tense atmosphere from start to end, it has plenty of gore and violence to bombard your eyes, not to mention that ENDING. Man I LOVE that ending. With unknown actors and they all did and incredible job acting in these types of situations. This film was, in my opinion, exciting, thrilling, and an overall entertaining film to watch. It delivered the necessary chills, to keep its audiences fully awake, and engaged. This was an enormous achievement for both James Wan, and Leigh Wannell. The two have created a well-deserved horror/thriller, without the necessary cliches. The film is incredible and it start from Saw 2,3,4,5,6, Final Chapter, Jigsaw, and now in 2020 Spiral. I don't care what anyone says Saw is the best of the series and the best horror movie ever. 10/10. Love it.",10,2,8,23 October 2018
Rocky," Best Boxing movie ever.
","Rocky is a high quality movie it won the best picture at the oscars and it deserve it. It is a sport cinema masterpiece and Sylvester Stallone and Rocky is the underdog of the underdog story's. Sylvester was always poor and almost homeless in the 70's, he didn't had anything to eat. This is the best sport boxing drama of all time, I have ever seen. I would say 'Rocky' and 'First Blood' are the best movies in the franchise that Stallone filmed them. They started everything in his life and career. God I love this movie. The best drama and boxing movie I have ever seen (Along with Creed). The sequels were good but none of them were as comparable than the very first Rocky. I can tell Sylvester Stallone put huge efforts to make a great movie. And it was perfect in the end. Everything was so great and it was just worth the watch. Please go watch this movie......PLEASE. If you saw it already GO and see it again. I watch it every month and this movie is always great along with that montage. Worth every second. 10/10",10,0,0,14 March 2020
Joker," Dear DC make more movies like this. Please.
","Joker is what I call a masterpiece, the film was phenomenal, brilliant,etc. I saw the film x2 and i was the best film I have ever seen. People say Avengers Endgame, is the best films of this year..... ROTFLMFAO. Joker is the best movie of 2019. As for Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck/Joker, what can I say he deserves an Oscar for this performance, I can not stop praising how good he was, I felt every pain and laugh he went through, the film was just great. Ceaser Romero and Heath Ledger would be proud of this guy. Joaquin Phoenix is the guy who would put his acting skills first then the money. He was dedicated to play the Joker and he absolutely nailed it. Todd Phillips is now one of my favorite directors now, along with Matt Reeves, Steven Spielberg, and Chris Nolan. I saw two times and I plan to see it again. Because, movies like these deserve 2 billion dollars in the box office, NOT ENDGAME. 10/10. The best movie of 2019 in my honest opinion.",10,3,5,12 October 2019
It Chapter Two," I like it
","To me, I think it is a good part 2. Now was this better than Chapter 1, In my honest opinion....... yeah.I think it was better, to me I like the connections the adults have with each other and it really got to give credit to the cast. Bill Hader of course was funny and awesome in the role, no matter what he gave a good performance. And of course Bill Skarsgard was phenomenal in this film because, no matter what he does he always steals the show. The way they beat Pennywise though I can agree it was kind of lazy. But overall It was a good part 2. 8/10",8,3,5,9 September 2019

It will make you laugh, cry, get scared, have chills, etc. name any genre and it is all in one. That's why I love it so much it all the genres of any movie and it is in this film just as one. The cast were phenomenal and fantastic. I didn't get to see this in theaters.... and boy does that suck. I loved it so much 2019 had the best movies I have ever seen such as Joker and 1917.

Godzilla," I don't why it's a 5 but it still is
","I love Godzilla. When I was a kid, I was and still am a Godzilla fanboy. I love Godzilla. I love the fact they change Godzilla appearance and roar, especially roar. Every time he was on the screen (which is barely 10 or 15 minutes) it just stole the show for me..... But WTF is Godzilla only having 15 minutes of screen time, I don't give a shit about the characters as they were boring, AF. Despite all that, the times Godzilla was on screen, I enjoyed the fuck out of it. 5/10",5,0,6,29 April 2019
The Pursuit of Happyness," Made me cry... such a beautiful movie
","This movie made feel what it's like to be broke, have a broken marriage, being a father. All of that is being feel in this movie and I can't stop praising this film. I swear this film makes you feel like Chris Gardener. He has had a bad life and to get through the hard obstacles, all that.... just to support his son. All of these things are done just for doing it for his love one. In the end, this is a movie made me cry, cry cause the movie was just beautiful, I love it. 10/10 Beautiful.
