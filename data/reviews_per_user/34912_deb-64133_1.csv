First Man," Powerful, Moving
","A behind-the-scenes view of what happened. Don't expect a documentary-style pic- his was more a depiction of Armstrong and his relationships than anything else, especially about the legacy of the death of his daughter and the effect of the space mission on his relationship with his wife (played by Claire Foy). I can't believe that Andrew Urban described her performance as 'warm and touching' - it was anything but,
IMO. Prickly, layered, powerful is how I would describe it, & if she hasn't scored an Oscar nomination I'll be a monkey's uncle. Watch it for fascinating background history and relationship tension. Some of the technical stuff was OTT.",8,7,18,13 October 2018
