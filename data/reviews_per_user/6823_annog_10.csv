Ali," 'Ali' could be a masterpiece if it was cut by 20 minutes
","Upon attending the Canadian premiere of Ali I was struck by two conflicting elements, in coming to terms with this film.I found myself alternately impressed by the earthy power of the film, and anxious with its excessive length. My needless concern was that Will Smith was just not enough actor to be Muhammed Ali. He was, and it was a charming surprise.But there are scenes, important scenes, wonderful scenes, where directer Michael Mann drives a point so hard, that one has seizures from the excesses.Ali could be one of the best films, ever, if about twenty minutes were pruned intelligently from it. The love scenes, the scene where Ali rides triumphantly into Zaire, and later, the scene where Ali runs through the streets in Zaire are interesting for only for about 1/4 of their duration.Did Michael Mann feel that every second of film shot needs to be used in the final cut? Go see Ali, for you may catch the taunt story inside this overweight epic.",Null,0,0,17 December 2001
Training Day," denzel gets oscar, but all is not perfect...
","SPOILERS ALERT I am glad the Denzel won his first best actor Oscar. I could think of other roles he has played more deserving of accolades. Fair enough, he does a fine job here.The problem with this movies is not the acting, though Ethan Hawke is no giant. The problem with this movie is the writing.I will give this movies top marks for disturbing imagery, and its hyper-adrenaline feel. But some things just do not make sense in the plot.Denzel's character plays a street-wise narcotics cop, tough as coffin nail, always one step ahead of everyone. Ethan Hawke is a boy scout of uniform cop, that is on his first training day with Denzel.We the audience are then taking for a ride. Denzel puts the rookie through hell, and we squirm watching.He talks/tricks the newbie into smoking pcp, drinking beer, and pocketing confiscated money. If that doesn't push your sense of disbelief, Denzel, then shows him his personal whore, and bastard son. To cap off a typical LAPD first day, training day, Denzel then introduces Hawke's character to three high ranking government officials, all who reveal their high level corruption in casual conversation. From these three they get permission to murder a major drug dealer, and split four million dollars in drug money.When Hawke's character refuses to go along after the murder, Denzel then tricks him into going to a rat's nest of gangsters, abandoning him to be murdered by the gang.At this point we have to figure Hawke's character as a very stupid man.Yet after he is released by the gangsters( for saving the leader's cousin that morning)he stalks Denzel at his whore's apartment, and get's the drop on him.After the completely predictable long fight scene between Denzel, and Hawke, Denzel is confronted by all the gang members that he previously owned, and Hawke is allowed to escape. Instead of killing Denzel they just stare at him as though they very disappointed in him, and go home.In the end, Denzel is killed by some Russians, whom we have never seen before in the movie.Just a few holes in the plot?",Null,1,11,25 March 2002
Fight Club," death of a modern consumer zombie/sissy boy
","Fight club changed my life.The movie gave me with a glimmer of hope with respect to young men. After viewing it, I realized someone else out there knows that the boys of North America have allowed themselves to become second class citizens. Instead of becoming men, valuing strength and independence, they instead opt for a few shopping trinkets, seeing cowardice as political sophistication. The support group was their father's generation. Their testicles removed, they became clumsy and frightened women.Ed Norton's character is dead. He works, he buys, he cleans, he submits. This is one extreme of male behavior. He permits himself to be consumed by the 'single serving' world. He does not acknowledge that he has choices beyond that which keep him under control.Brad Pitt's character is another extreme. He strikes back at a psychotic world, with psychotic remedies. He will not be a slave.To me, the idea of fighting, represented the notion that there are far worse things in life than taking a punch in the face. The process of organizing your life so that you will never experience danger, or a punch in the face, virtually guarantees a living death.Therefore, when the members of Fight Club first took a beating it was liberation. Although undesirable, the pain was a distant second to the experience to that of life as a slave/ consumer zombie.No one comes out a clear winner in this film. Neither Jack's side, nor Tyler's point of view seems to be a complete solution.
I hope that young men will take this idea and build on it.Be a little brave, you will have a better life.",Null,0,1,6 May 2000
Bohemian Rhapsody," Loved Queen, Hated This Amateurish Ham Handed Movie.
","Whether you like Queen or not, this is one terrible film. It is so bad in so many ways. The actor who plays Freddy, has two things right. Freddy's posh accent and his teeth. Maybe Freddy was not very bright, but he was as charming as he was talented and he was a gymnast on stage. I have enjoyed Malek's work in other movies but his characterisation of Mercury makes him look like a cross eyed vampire ( the teeth thing). On the concert stage Rami just looks awful. Mainy times in this film you are actually embarrassed for his Freddy. In fact some may find Rami Malek's portrayal insulting to Freddy's memory.So, you might think never mind, just go for the music, and that never really happens. We only get silly, little carelessly selected snippets of the music of Queen. You rarely get to sit back and enjoy the band.The writing is just putrid bad. Long periods of clumsy sentimental nothingness, and then a little bit about the band.Save yourself the time and money. Go for one of the documentaries on Queen that have been popped out recently.Just saying this because I am surprised a bush effort like this is so largely praised. This time the critics were right.",1,9,17,11 February 2019
The Italian Job," More of a snow job, really...
","After viewing The Italian Job, we understand why Ed Norton distanced himself from this Hollywood whore, saying it was nothing more than contractual obligation that made him take part in this film.The Italian Job has the attitude, clothes, and hairstyles for a decent Mini Cooper commercial, but the this same approach stinks up a motion picture. And there is so little else here that the movie teeters on tedium at timesHollywood sure knows how to make gloss, and this picture has buckets of it. Trouble is, that gloss in large amounts becomes rancid goo. The Italian Job is sickeningly sweet from the the first scene, and pours on the glucose all through the film.Trouble is also  that modern movie audiences don't seem to tell a good film from a jelly doughnut. I fear we will see more of this sort of drivel in the future.
The wimpy sensitive new age relationship between the criminals is the excess that puts this movie over the top,successfully pushing it from merely mediocre, into shamefully shallow. Get a dialogue writer, will ya, Gary Gray?",Null,0,1,10 November 2003
28 Days Later...," Standard Zombie vehicle with some very silly politics
","I was in the mood for a scary movie, but 28 Days Later does not satisfy. This is your standard end of civilization/ avoid the zombies horror picture. It has all been done before, many times. It is interesting to figure out how under such duress the characters in this movie can continuously come up with nice new fashion outfits, all while they are fleeing for their lives in absolute terror.They must be consumer zombies, which is kind of horrifying, but not at all in the way I had wanted, or expected. Sure,it's the end of the world, but why stop shopping? In the end, the movie puts forward the idea that the army guys that are there to protect them, are the real monsters, worse even than the murderous hoards.  I reckon that is what some people prefer to believe, and you have to hope that they never have the opportunity to test out their theories in a truly bad situation, where things have fallen apart and they need help. But they will have their smug little attitudes until then, won't they? Maybe we need a good zombie infestation to demonstrate the difference between real horror and post modern paranoia.",1,3,7,11 November 2003
Blow," True story? Big fiction more like it.
","You cannot say that 'Blow' was not an entertaining movie. After reading Bruce Porter's book, 'Blow' I do not believe that it could be called a true story. Hollywood screenwriters often compress, and consolidate characters for the sake of a shorter script, and the audience's limited attention span. In Blow, the writers created deliberate and misleading events that manipulated their story about George Jung.When George is first busted with the marijuana, his girlfriend meets him at the courthouse to tell him that she has cancer, and she has less than two years left to live. We gush with sympathy for George when he makes the decision to run from jail and tend to his sick love. According to Bruce Porter's book, on which the movie is based, this never happened. George's love relationships at the time were basically numerous, and casual. Many of his girlfriends were also his dope runners. George simply did not want to go to jail. He had a lot of money, and went on a bender until they caught up with him. There is nothing mentioned in the book about any girlfriend with cancer, ever.
In the end George trusts and old friend, and he is set up by narcotics agents.He is busted and goes to jail gain. We are told that this was  to be the end for George. He was only getting one last score and he was going to get lost with his daughter.Wrong. George was scamming, as he had always done. He might have retired, but shortly before hand he learned through his lawyer that all his 63 million was gone from his Panamanian account. By the way, according to Bruce Porter's book he spent it. Therefore he never appeared in Panama for the money, and it wasn't appropriated by the Panamanian government, as in the movie.You just have to see a picture of his L.A. connection, played by Pee Wee Herman in the film. The real Richard Barile was anything but effeminate. He was a short but burly, fuzz haired, balding, bearded, ex marine who did service in Vietnam. 
George never appeared at his former Columbian partner, Carlos Lehder's island, let alone put a gun to his head. George's sole form of revenge resulted from his testimony against Carlos Lehder in the 1980's. At the time Jung was himself in prison.
There are many bits of the film which are authenticated in Bruce Porter's book. I invite you to read 'Blow'. It is a darn fine yarn, notwithstanding that it tells an entirely different story, at times.This facts are not meant to detract from the film's entertainment value.. I love the Coen brother's films. However, I looked into 'Fargo' and I learned that virtually none of that happened either. (Go here to see: http://www.brainerddispatch.com/fargo/ ) I still love the Coen brother's work.",Null,0,0,9 October 2001
Vanilla Sky," The Heavy Hand Of Cameron Crowe
","Vanilla Sky suffers from a certain smugness, a too glib bent to the dialogue and actor's technique.As in Almost Famous, Crowe pivots his film around one or two compellingly attractive stars.In this case Tom Cruise, and in Almost Famous, Kate Hudson.Cruise, like Hudson would do well to learn to shut up, and stop showing off their teeth. Though both actors do a superb job of flashing THE charming smile, we can get too much of a slick thing. Added to the mix, they are surrounded by lesser mortals with the same affliction of refined white flour dialogue, and cheesy grinitis.We are also left to wonder what exactly does the music have to do with what(little) is going on, on screen?I can see this guy Cameron Crowe doing smarmy TV in the near future.",1,2,6,1 November 2003
The Thin Red Line," If we Just show the world how soft we are, maybe they will all go soft too
","Being reluctant to go to war is universal. That is one way that we know not everyone is capable of bravery. This is part of what marks the hero as distinct from the ordinary man.Who amongst us does not agree that war is hell? We can safely consign those who do not think it a monsterous terror to the any number of of debilitating mental disorders.It is a common ritual for north american, and european males  to denounce it. To be clear, this sort of wallpaper must be distinct from true sensitivity. True sensitivity involves an appreciation of colour, form, emotion, art the weather...etc. It permits one to imagine the feelings, and suffering of others. True sensitivity is what causes us to create.The sort that makes drunken boys declare war to be uncool at parties is to be mistrusted.We may forgive a man, or film director who in the name of getting some female attention goes a bit too soft. 
It is with this falsetto voice The Thin Red Line is narrated. Not that the movie does not have a sense of beauty. But, beauty is not truth. Nor, is it philosophy. Often it tugs at our hearts, while fogging our minds.The Thin Red Line has certain other problems. One is dialogue. Many times the soldiers's words do not strike one as belonging to 1945 mainly rural GIs.
Their attitudes are contemporary, and lack the formality of the class, and rank divisions that were prevalent at the time. One simply did not mouth off to the 'Top' Sgt, and expect nothing to come of it. The captain was not your buddy.Even the hairstyles are out of place. Either that or, this particular unit had a brigade of stylists and a vat of hair gel at their disposal.But, it is the little-boy-don't-wanna-go-to-war message that weighs it down most.Don't get me wrong, it is not a bad movie. I am on my 3rd viewing.But it is not a deep philosophical work, either.",Null,1,2,22 July 2001
Contact," Imaginative sci-fi, inside an absolutely obnoxious movie.
","There are 10 really wonderful minutes in this movie. Otherwise Contact is very shallow, a  daytime soap. Certainly many of the actors are not up to snuff. Angela Basset is particularly bad as the president's science advisor.Watch the ten minutes when she goes on the space voyage in the middle of the film. This is as remarkable a bit of cinema as you will ever see.The rest is very bad packaging.",Null,0,2,24 January 2002
