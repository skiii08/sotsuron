Hereditary," Emotional horror movie
","I can understand why people on one side rate it a 10 and on the other a 1. You need to love the emotional side of this great movie. The nice build up, great acting, beautiful background music, and not to forget in my opinion the overwhelming time put into the details. Yeah, I've seen many movies much scarier than this one, but damn, this movie touched me in ways other scarier movies couldn't do. So yeah, I understand both sides. If you're not Into this emotional stuff it wouldn't touch you in any way and there won't be any scary parts able to compromise that in a positive way.Btw, did not like the ending, that's why I rated it with an 8. Very disappointing after all that emotional stuff.",8,1,2,28 August 2018
2012," Mixed feelings
","The acting wasn't bad nor the special effects. And the length of the movie was fine too since you need time to build out the characters. But them, being lucky twice in a row in anything is a achievement upon its on, but like twenty times? I think you all know what I mean, it's just not realistic. But not a reason to rate it below a 6. I was entertained and I watched the whole thing. Giving it below ok, but like many others giving it a 1 , that's not fair! Be honest, too much right to say it was all wrong.... Period!",6,1,1,7 August 2018
Silence," Slow but good
","I hesitated to watch this movie, I mean, almost 3 hours?! But honestly, I do not regret it. Nice build up and nicely shot. The locations were also very well chosen!The thing however I really am bothered with is historical accuracy. I like Japanese people and somehow always respected them while realizing what they did during ww2. But if this is true then I believe they were the most evil people towards Christianity. Just disgusting to say the least. Heard a lot from what happened in countries all over the world, but this was just beyond everything...I really hope some parts were fiction and not based on real historical facts.",7,0,0,30 September 2018
Midsommar," This is crap
","Really, never ever saw a movie this bad! Long, boring, stupid and above all unintelligent.",1,52,95,30 September 2019
