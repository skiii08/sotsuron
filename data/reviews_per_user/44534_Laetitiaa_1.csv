","This is an incredible film by Elem Kilmov, that takes us inside the truth incident of the world war 2 through a young boys eyes. It is not often I get affected by movies but this is certainly a movie that affected me and opened my eyes. It made me disgusted by the humanity. How can people be such savages towards each other especially towards innocent children, women and old people to lock them inside houses and burn them. I feel a huge sympathy for those people who were killed during this war. I think by doing this movie he expressed his opinions and emotions about the world war 2 through a young boy, because he was a kid when the world war 2 erupted. I believe that this movie shows the truth side of the war. I love the way the movie is filmed, because it makes you feel like you are a part of the movie. Like you are experiencing the incidents that the characters are going through. The camera movement and the iconic picture is so well done and intensive. The close up of the character catches the intensive emotion. The sound effect on the deaf boy makes you go inside his brain.You can feel the pain and confusion he is going through, like he is losing his mind. Even if this movie represent sorrow and cruelty I could still see some moments of joy. One scene in particular is when the character Glasha dances after the Germans bombarded their camp. It was a way for them to show that they are still alive. I think the message of the film has a good connection to the title. The title says it all, come and see how they German soldiers treated us, locked innocent and hopeless unequipped Soviet resistance in their house and burned them. The camera really takes you inside the cruelty of the world war 2. The cast of the film is incredibly talented. The music of Mozart that was used in this movie, lifts the film and gives it a powerful and beautiful sound. The soundtrack and sound is designed in a way to put us through a war so we can feel what the population during the war felt like. You can also through the music hear all elements of sorrow, horror, fear, darkness, despair and in a way happiness all at the same time. Do you think war is cool? Shooting and killing some enemies? Watch this film and then ask yourself the same question. I guarantee you that it will change your view of all the violence. It is an incredibly touching and great movie.",9,1,1,11 December 2011
