Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Good film but does not live up to the originals
","This is a good sci-fi movie that is the beginning of the StarWars storyline. The movie delves a lot into political turmoil and conflict and tries to please a wide variety of audiences. It also tries to stand on its own which it does not do very well. The characters are well thought out though....Jar Jar is very annoying, Darth Maul is fearsome and mysterious etc. and the action scenes are top notch. But there is an overall feel that something is missing, probably due to the fact that we remember watching the originals a long time ago which are the meat and potatoes of the Star Wars story. Watch it as a good sc-fi movie and you will enjoy most of it.",7,0,1,26 July 2001
The Matrix Revolutions," Been there done that
","Exactly how I feel about this series. Yes just watch the first film and enjoy it for what it is or play a video-game.If you want spiritual plots just pop in an anime or watch Starwars, The Ten Commandments, read the Bible and then watch Aliens and finish up with a cheezy Kung-Fu movie. There you have it.This is just severely disappointing by the Watch-my-comicbook brothers.",1,2,3,8 November 2003
Resident Evil," If you played the game you will love this movie!
","This movie contains the following:1. Zombies 2. Guns 3. Pretty girls 4. More guns. 5. More Zombies.If you enjoy good horror flicks or better yet, good zombie horror flicks this is for you. Short and simple. A good horror flick based on the games.(Warning: If you have not played the games you might not like it as much)",10,0,0,15 March 2002
The Mummy Returns," Stupid but fun to watch
","Boring, cliche etc. and a major rip-off of Indiana Jones makes me hate this movie but part of me enjoyed it especially the great action scenes. Its predictable and corny but if you need some of this type of thing then go see it. Also, you MUST watch the first Mummy to enjoy this.....otherwise its a pretty brainless film.",2,0,0,23 May 2001
The Matrix," Good but not great
","A good film which takes numerous other genre's and mixes them into a cool modern\scfi action film.If you've read the Bible and other books, have watched movies like Tron, Aliens, StarWars etc. and are into anime (japanese animation). Then this movie might be unimpressive and something you have seen before especially in anime.Otherwise its a fine film which delves into the pure simple matter of existence.Good film, boring after the 3rd or 4th viewing and something I already experienced before in other films/media, but its great to see it done this way.I'm split 50/50 on this movie, I don't hate it, I actually enjoy it but I also don't think its all that original. Watch it and make up your own mind.",6,0,1,19 June 2003
