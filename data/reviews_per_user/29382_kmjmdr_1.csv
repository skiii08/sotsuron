","The graphics, music and storytelling totally mingle into each-other like a magical symphony. This is a story with lots of illustration and less dialogue. The signs and transitions are beautifully weaved into the visuals without unnecessary talking and explaining stuff.
Totally enjoyed it. Slow but steady-moving. Times reminisced are endless. The Radwimps rock!",10,3,4,20 January 2018
