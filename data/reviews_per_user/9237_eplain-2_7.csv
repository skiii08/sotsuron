Black Swan," All loose ends never tied up. Lame.
","OK, I was glued for the 1st half. The 2nd half I was dying to know HOW they were going to explain this stuff!!....... well....They don't.There is a difference between leaving something to the imagination, and tossing out a bunch of things and leaving you with your hand on your Butt.Some decent acting, could have been a decent movie, but the story is shallow and they offer nothing to you so you can put it all together. You can't put it together. because the writers didn't either.Go ahead, watch it for the titillating parts, it is all you get... but not worth it at ALL.",3,2,4,12 June 2015
Unbreakable," Laughable. Stay way from this
","I was trying to think of witty things to say but, it doesn't even deserve my time to do that. The worst part of the movie is- Samuel L. Jackson (who isn't in enough movies right?) gets to wear the purple weird outfit and act freaky......did you expect something else?
It sucked. That's all I got for you.....it sucked, and SLJ makes it suck.If you last long enough, enjoy the subtle messages in the film. One in particular that is hysterical.....a few white kids do a drive-bye assault on a black couple, smashing a bottle over their head. Hysterical.",1,2,11,18 January 2019
American Hustle," Fantastic!
","I didn't see this in the Theater, saw it on TV, then watched it again and realized I loved everything about it. I cannot think of ONE complaint.The music alone, intertwined with the scenes? AMAZING.Could it be that I remember this time period very well (I was a teenager)& all the great music? maybe that's why it has such an effect on me? Maybe.But I loved the acting, the whole package.I bought it on Blu-ray yesterday and saw it again last night in my theater room (60 inch TV, with sound system, lights off) and was reassured.... this has made it into my top movie collection.What to say about the movie? Give Details? No reason to. I do think you can love it or maybe walk out on it...IF, you are the kind of person that can't sit still and pay attention for 30 minutes. The world is full of people that need today's kind of super hero/special effects every 5 minutes, but not me.It takes 30 minutes to set it up (this is the time 0-30, where someone may walk out) I'm not saying it has a lull here, it does not, i just know the nature of a lot of people today. I was gripped the whole time, but I am a movie lover, some people just watch movies to pass the time, i stop the world when I watch a movie.Watch this movie, if not for the fact that Danny Elfman does the music, and anything he is in is usually worth it just for HIS effort.I saw it 3 times in the last 2 months, i LOVE this movie!",9,0,2,22 February 2015
The Revenant," The 'Boy' DiCaprio; Far from Oscar worthy
","Any Baldwin brother could have acted his part.DiCaprio's problem is that every time he opens his mouth it screams- 'Young Boy'. He hasn't the physical or more importantly- vocal requirements that would display him as a 'Man', and that's where films like this just don't work with him. He fits well into movies like 'Catch me if you can', but he is NO John Wayne or Clint Eastwood... or even Alec Baldwin! and that's not good.For me? Standing up (or laying down) and making impressive looks on your face isn't acting, really. Not the kind that should bring you Oscar. Unless all the others last year were pretty lame.His role was pretty shallow and didn't offer much for him to show off acting talents.The Film? was put together quite well. Very well. I am very picky about reality though, simply walking through a stream and soaking your feet in those conditions would have been a death sentence. There were several other things that made me smirk, but there have been other movies that take liberties with reality.John Fitzgerald acted better than DiCaprio. Either the other movies actors were even more shallow, or he was given this award for some other reason.The movie was good, would I buy it and add it to my collection? No.PS- Open note to Chris Rock... I am a white guy... does this review make me racist?.... you idiot.",7,2,4,29 February 2016
Dallas Buyers Club," WAY over rated, & I wouldn't have awarded Leto.
","So many people speak 'about Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto's astonishing transformations, and brilliant performances', well, I disagree. These were 2 of the easiest roles to play (Especially Leto's). Any Baldwin brother could have done it (that's a dig, on both sides, yes it is). McConaughey loses a ton of weight and turns himself into a character so physically unappealing, I almost shut my TV off just because seeing him hit in Jennifer Garner was sort of gross (Not that she's a beauty by any stretch, but, well, it's a turnoff). Seeing his bare ass & testicles was less of a turnoff, and that's saying something. He forgets the old adage 'just because you CAN doesn't mean you should'.Leto has the assistance of a 'million dollar' team of makeup artists, and the work of those people should not influence someone to vote for him for an Academy Award. His acting was over the top at times and there was nothing appealing about his character, at all. Even evil characters can be appealing! make you love them and root for them, because hey! it's a movie. Leto hinges everything on the makeup, which by the way....was laughable most of the time, and that everyone knows Hollywood loves a flamboyant homosexual... you almost can't lose.McConaughey... he gets to run through the halls of the Hospital going anywhere he wants at anytime screaming at people, yelling out every foul mouthed word he can, again NOT great acting as i see it. The character (again) NOT appealing, actually repulsive, you can't wait for him to stop, whatever it is he is doing, it's just too much. Again, you don't ever begin to 'love' this....person. You don't like him, you don't even care for him. And it didn't help that he went from 'I want to save my life, to I am going to save all the AIDS victims in the world in about 1.5 seconds. Something was missing there.This movie gets a 2, 1 extra point because ... I actually made it to the end! If you want to see a typical Hollywood movie where they twist the the facts a bit, re-write history (Just enough), make the children smarter than the parents, the patient smarter than the Doctor, The Mexican Doctor better than the American Doctor, the nurse smarter than the WHOLE hospital, the young wiser than the old, the defendant smarter than the Judge, the creeps of the world that can pass off as circus performers smarter than the EVERYONE above them.... well..... you get the point..... then this movie is for you.PS- I watched American Hustle 3 times last month, I can't get enough of that movie and those characters!. I will never watch THIS movie ever again, and THAT is the sign of a poor movie for me.",2,13,23,4 March 2015
Legends of the Fall," A movie I can watch, again... and again (that says a lot)
","I have read all the reviews here on this movie and there is no need to repeat some of the wonderful things said, I will just say that I agree with all the positive things posted... 100%. At this writing, this is my favorite movie to watch. I am not saying it is the best movie/film of all time, but for me at this moment...but it could be.Now, for the negativity...OK, there are some things/errors that i read about that I didn't even pick up on when I watched this movie. I will give those people a nod for pointing that out, but if I am honest, unless it hurts my viewing of the movie in some way, I really don't care if a character used a camera that wasn't invented yet, continuity issues, other technical errors... This movie is FANTASTIC! and whatever I read, and was informed of after I saw the movie that was incorrect, didn't affect my viewing at the time, and & doesn't affect my viewing of it again and again. I own this DVD and it is a must for my collection. OK, I did have a few issues with Tristan at some point, and I watched the deleted/extra scenes to clear up some of it (I'm sure many know what I'm talking about), and I don't think that should have to happen. I'll cut a little slack for a film when it's based on a novel, that one can read, after all, they can't get it all in sometimes (though this one was a little odd). These are things I consider when/if voting for awards, but if you want to put all that aside, this movie has great acting & cinematography, the story is top notch and it all combines for an all -time favorite for me.",9,1,3,26 January 2011
Meet Joe Black," Painful to watch
","OK, here goes.....This was PAINFUL to watch. Someone recommended it to me multiple times, and when I saw it in the WalMart bargain bin for $5 I picked it up. I was glued the whole time, and that usually is a mark of a good movie for me. Can I be captivated for 2 hours?, if so, 'good movie'. In this case, it was 3 hours of pain. I was captivated because I kept holding out for something to happen (since it was so highly recommended), but it never came. It is what I call a 'Cluster F@#$%K'. It was all over the place. I think someone decided to get Brad Pitt for their movie, and THEN made the movie. This is clearly made to showcase Brad's pretty face for 3..long...boring....hours.I loved Legends of the Fall, which had both of these guys in it, so I am not anti-Brad. And I love Hopkins (as long as he isn't playing Hannibal). But this movie goes NO WHERE FAST! (I mean...SLOW!!). You may get a woman to stare at Brad for 3 hours, or maybe a gay fella, but for me, you MUST have a better story line that THAT!. Wow....BAD. Whoever said 'hey. lets make a shallow stupid film, and lets let it go for 3 hours, needs to find another line of work.Jeffrey Tambor is the same character he plays in EVERY movie. But it was Jake Weber that gave me whatever it took to stick around and say I SAW one of the worst movies of all time. And when I tell someone that opinion, I Don't want to hear 'Did you see the end? NO? OH you MISSED IT!'. Nope, I saw the whole stupid thing.",1,2,6,19 September 2009
