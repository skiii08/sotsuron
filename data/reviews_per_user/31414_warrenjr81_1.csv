"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Perfect British rom com
","There have been many British rom coms in the past couple of decades, many of them including Hugh Grant and his slightly off putting foppish hair.I have personally found that the Simon Pegg take on romance to be far more personable and less likely to make you throw up over other people in the audience.Yes it was predictable, yes it wasn't original but the humour was spot on, the characters were believable and the directing was brilliant in my eyes as it captured the English town vibe without seeming like a low budget British soap.Although it contained every clich√© in the book from the genres of rom com and 'training to win something' movies it didn't seem forced to me and was light hearted and genuinely funny.It also had some of my favourite actors from Bristish comedy in it.Basically if you like spaced (one of the best series ever) and you don't mind the obvious plot and just sit back and enjoy the movie then you may find, like me, that this is just a purely brilliant movie.",9,45,69,16 February 2008
