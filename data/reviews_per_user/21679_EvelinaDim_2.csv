Black Swan," A beautiful mind!
","A rather accurate depiction of a schizophrenic individual and the brilliance of a distorted brain. The palindrome between reality and fantasy is shown in a playful and at times enigmatic way. The film manages to create a wide range of emotions and subsequently a palette of facial expressions to the viewer; fear as you expect the worse can happen at any time. Admiration of the stamina, endurance and the way she lives her dual life while reaching the top. The viewer can almost empathise and 'ok' the existence of their deepest secret thoughts. The catharsis of the 'swan' leaves a feeling of contentment after the symphony of the emotions. It is as if the whole movie was written with the music in mind and the emotions go up, down; mix up like the notes on a page of a music composition. In one word: Brilliance!",9,4,8,13 February 2011
Midnight in Paris," Midnight Magic in Paris....
","Woody Allen directs his first digitally enhanced movie without losing the emotion while leaving the audience with a distinct aftertaste. A young writer finds himself in Paris with his wealthy inlaws and his soon to be wife typical American heiress. He has dreams, romance, aspirations to find his inspiration in a flat in Paris.One midnight he gets absorbed in an illusion, he becomes a protagonist in a world of nostalgia, dreams, in an artificial temporary fantasy with beautiful sounds,vintellect, romance, intensity, excitement.The sunrise brings him back to his wedding plans and reflecting on life and decisions.A movie to watch in a cosy afternoon.Owen Wilson, excels for one more time in getting the right balance between being naive and eventually true to yourself and others. Marion Cottilard, a 1920s' diva, as in le Petit Mouchoirs, she has a certain je ne sais quoi, she doesn't fails to be effortlessly attractive, powerfully captivating by her sincerity and self confidence. A movie that makes you feel like drinking red wine, listening to Cole's voice in a vinyl record and singing to yourselfLet's Do It, let's Fall In Love.",8,1,1,19 December 2011
