Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Brilliant!!! If you are an idiot you won't understand this movie
","This is one of the best comedies i have seen lately and also one of the best documentaries about the American society today Indeed Borat might shock you but if you are smart enough to understand that this is the purpose of this documentary you will enjoy this 100%. The homophobic, antisemitic, missogine, sexist and so on jokes are made with a purpose: to show the common reaction of the people around and to show how far snobism, greed, idiocy and all the other human's spirit defects can go. Stupid people will be shocked by this movie and smart people will see it as it was meant to be seen: an accurate view from an outsider. All along you will observe through a magnifying glass how the different cultures are seen here, and how if you are different you will be ridiculed and seen as a freak.THUMBS UP!!!PS: The language spoken in his village is Romanian and the music is mainly from Ederlezi of Goran Bregovic (gipsy music from Serbia)",10,6,19,5 November 2006
