Casablanca," Start of a beautiful friendship
","Humphrey Bogart (Rick) and Sydney Greenstreet (Ferrari) each own a café/bar in Casablanca which is frequented by those wishing to make an exit to Lisbon and a new found freedom. Casablanca is on French soil and Claude Rains (Renault) is the Captain in charge who must co-operate with Nazi Conrad Veidt (Strasser). The two cafes are riddled with black market shenanigans and into this town wanders Resistance leader Paul Henreid (Victor Lazlo) and Ingrid Bergman (Ilsa). In order to make it to freedom, an exit visa is required and this is what Henreid and Bergman are after.An entertaining film with a good cast and very amusing dialogue. Bogart rattles off some classic lines but it's Claude Rains whose delivery tops the charts. One moment that I found funny is when a grateful couple approach him and enthusiastically let him know that they will be at his office at 6:00am to collect their visas. 'I'll be there at 10:00' is his reply. The moral of that is don't be so keen, it gets you nowhere. A good lesson for anyone starting a new job.'Here's looking at you' gets a bit clichéd but it doesn't matter. I never cared for Humphrey Bogart and his man who stands alone image. It always struck me as cold and unpleasant. However, I'm starting to really like him these days.One daft thing about the film is how the Nazis didn't find the visas. The hiding place is pretty obvious if you ask me. A couple of last points - remember next time you get to a roulette table – number 22 - and the French National Anthem is way better than the dreary UK effort.",8,2,3,14 September 2015
Lifeboat," Anyone got a compass?
","At the beginning we see a sinking ship and debris floating in the water before the camera settles on the lifeboat where the immaculate Connie (Tallulah Bankhead) is alone. The lifeboat soon fills up with characters, including Willy (Walter Slezak) the German captain of the submarine responsible for the sinking of the ship. The film follows the quest to safety in Bermuda. However, only Willy knows the way.....The story provides suspense as we watch Willy gradually take over control of the lifeboat. He is assured and possesses all the necessary skills that are called upon including surgery, seamanship, strength and a peculiar navigational awareness.... Do we, the audience, trust him just as the other members in the lifeboat have to? He seems nice enough.The cast are good with Tallulah Bankhead and Walter Slezak winning the acting honours. Hume Cronym as 'Sparks' has a peculiar voice and John Hodiak as 'Kovac' has an unfortunate array of teeth in his mouth - he reminded me of 'Bingo' from the 'Banana Splits' whenever he smiled. It's quite off-putting.It's an entertaining film, if a little long, but it's worth seeing again. I won't go into the finer details of German Expressionism versus Soviet Expressive Realism which Hitchcock manages to combine, but I will say that he makes his usual appearance.",8,1,1,5 March 2011
To Be or Not to Be," Encore!
","Husband and wife Carole Lombard (Maria) and Jack Benny (Joseph) are the leading lights in a Polish Theatre Company during the outbreak of World War 2. They are currently performing 'Hamlet' and soldier Robert Stack (Sobinski), who is obsessed with Lombard and attends all her performances, is there in the audience on every occasion. Lombard and Stack arrange meetings with a pre-determined code. When Benny gives his 'To be or Not to Be' soliloquy, that is Stack's cue to get up and leave and go backstage, much to Benny's outrage at someone getting up and leaving during his finest moment! When traitor Stanley Ridges (Professor Siletsky) passes through Poland on his way to deliver a list of names of Polish Resistance members to Hitler, the actors jump into action to prevent him reaching Germany with the list. Can they get away with their daring charades? This film is funnier than I expected and had me laughing out loud on a few occasions. Jack Benny is excellent in the lead role and the whole cast are on form. There are loads of humorous scenes and the film has a great ending to round things off. It's a shame that they cut Carole Lombard's line about what could possibly happen in a plane from the film. This would have given extra poignancy to the film given that she died in a plane crash after making this film. I think the line should have remained in there.Basically, a gang of actors come good and defeat the Nazis through various deceptions. It's lightweight entertainment that really does entertain.",8,3,5,11 October 2015
Citizen Kane," Citizen Bore
","I watched this film expecting something great. After all, it is regularly labelled as the best film ever made. Well, it's not even close. I find it strange how so many people are scared to go against the grain and say it how it is. This film is an overlong snore-fest with no interesting characters. It's the story of one man's life. But his life isn't interesting at any point and certain scenes drag on. There is nothing to keep the viewer gripped to the story. OK, there are a few nice camera techniques, but wake up folks! Literally. Because many of you will fall asleep during this garbage. How this film is so popular is utterly baffling. It stresses the reality that people are sheep. Tell 'em it's good and they believe it.As for the cast, there are a couple of really grating characters – second wife 'Susan' as played by Dorothy Comingore and Everett Sloane who plays Mr Bernstein - what horrible whining, shouty voices.I sat through this film but it gave me very little in terms of entertainment. Time for the charity shop.",4,4,9,13 May 2014
The Great Dictator," A great comic
","Charlie Chaplin plays 2 roles. He is a Jewish barber who fought in the First World War for the Germans as well as Nazi leader Adenoid Hynkel. We follow their two separate stories until the film culminates in the barber giving his address to the might of the Germany military.Charlie Chaplin is funny and we get moments of 'laugh-out-loud' funny, because of the situations, his demeanour and his reactions. 'Would you like a cigarette?' is the question, 'Not now' comes the response from Chaplin as he hangs from a plane.However, the film is too long. We get far too much Hitler preachy stuff, some tiresome shouting with Jack Oakie playing the Mussolini role and a very obvious food fight. There is also a strange scene of Hitler playing with a balloon of the globe – it's balletic but not funny. Just weird. Unfortunately, some scenes do drag on and I found myself constantly wanting a story to unfurl. I think it was a good decision by him to make this film as he really does go to town with mocking Hitler.",6,1,4,15 June 2014
Dead Poets Society," Better than I expected
","John Keating (Robin Williams) is the new English teacher at a public school in the USA. He has unorthodox teaching methods that inspire his pupils who then set up the 'Dead Poet's Society', a society that Mr Keating was involved in when he was a student at the school. The idea is to meet up at night and recite poetry in order to free the mind and impress the ladies. We follow a handful of students as they try and do things their own way as inspired by Mr Keating but things go wrong.....I was surprised that I enjoyed it. Robin Williams isn't his usual annoying self. In fact, it is Ethan Hawke who plays Todd that walks away with the most annoying character award. His character is very frustrating. There are a few unrealistic threads to the story, eg, a group of boys meeting up to read poetry at night - no way - boys sneak out to play football at night NOT to read poetry to each other. In real boarding schools, new kids are indoctrinated with humiliating rituals such as masturbating onto a piece of toast or a biscuit - they are not asked if they want to join a study group. But, then again, Americans are a different species. And no way would a pupil stand up in class and recite a poem about his love for a girl infront of his classmates just like a sissy! I also found that I didn't quite believe Neil's (Robert Sean Leonard) actions at the end of the film and as for the new boy, Todd, who knows his room-mate least out of everyone else, his reaction only makes sense if he is dealing with some gay issues. However, there were some funny scenes and there were also some parts that make you think, eg, when the pupils are shown the pictures of previous pupils on the walls of the hallway - pupils who are now all dead. This film is responsible for idiots saying 'Carpe Diem'. Its a bit long but its entertaining despite a downbeat end section.",6,0,1,4 August 2009
The Grapes of Wrath," Viewer wrath
","At two hours length this film is an epic journey of boredom for the viewer. In its favour, we do get to see a couple of the really annoying characters die. Hooray! The film scores some points for that.Henry Fonda and John Carradine are the only good things about this film. Carradine seems to be in all the good scenes of which there are only a few. The story concerns a migrating family looking for work and the biases and injustices that they encounter. I don't like reading books – I find it boring - but I would recommend reading this book over the watching the film. Nothing happens! The whole first hour could be completely edited out. A bit of promise pops up in the 2nd half of the story before it reverts to being preachy and sentimental. Yawn.",3,3,8,17 May 2014
The Orphanage," Eerily satisfying
","Laura (Belen Rueda) lives with Carlos (Fernando Cayo) and their adopted son Simon (Roger Princep) in the orphanage building that she grew up in as a girl. She has plans to open it up as a home for disabled children. Simon seems to have invisible friends and when he goes missing, Laura is determined to find him - she knows that the answer lies in her orphanage home.It's a good ghost story, scary at times, always atmospheric and strangely pleasing at the end. The cast are good, especially Rueda in the lead role. There is also a good, sinister performance by Montserrat Carulla as Benigna. Good scenes include a game where Laura knocks 3 times on the wall before turning around to see if anyone is there and there is that moment that happens in all scary films where you shout out 'Nooo. Don't go down into the basement!' The only silly part of the film is the husband's unwillingness to stick with her at the end and the way in which Laura seems to be going through everything without her husband going through it with her at the same time. Still, you always have the feeling that Laura can face whatever is going on by herself. Which she does.",8,1,2,28 February 2010
Mamma Mia!," Fun Lightweight Nonsense
","Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) is getting married. She has found a diary belonging to her mother Donna (Meryl Streep), and, without her knowledge, she has invited Sam (Pierce Brosnan), Harry (Colin Firth) and Bill (Stellan Starsgard) to the wedding. One of these men is her father but no-one knows who. The film follows the story as the 3 men work out why they have been invited while Donna and her 2 pals, Rosie (Julie Walters) and Tanya (Christine Baranski), prepare for the wedding. We build up to the finale of the wedding but things don't work out as planned......The film is an excuse to string together Abba songs. It's played for comedy and the film is entertaining with some laugh-out-loud moments, eg, the performance of 'Lay All Your Love On Me' on the beach. All of the music numbers are entertaining and the film should be watched in a fun, lightweight mind-frame. The cast are all good and its a musical which will achieve cult status.",7,0,1,13 August 2009
Paranormal Activity," .....what is this demon...?
","Katie (Katie Featherston) and Micah (Micah Sloat) film and record the night-time activity in the house that they share. They are not alone......The film is a bit slow to get going. It comes alive after the visit of the Psychic (Mark Fredrichs). The cast are all good but there are the usual stupid moments that crop up in the storyline of nearly every scary film, ie, a refusal to switch on the lights when exploring something spooky in the night, and the compulsive urge to split up when strange noises are heard. The film is also full of ideas that have been ripped off from other films such as 'The Entity' and 'Blair Witch Project'.Whilst the film is alright as entertainment, it fails to explain what the demon is and there doesn't seem to be a coherent story. I also didn't like the ending. It seems to have been added on to get a shock factor into the story. The story is actually a million miles away from true poltergeist behaviour. The writers invented a demon for the story which is undefinable and so can't be compared to anything. It doesn't exist. I'm more scared of the Daleks.It's a mildly scary film that is basically a string of other films spliced together with a running thread of the main couple sleeping a lot.",6,1,2,21 April 2010
Some Like It Hot," Good
","Joe (Tony Curtis) and Jerry (Jack Lemmon) pose as Josephine and Daphne in an all-girl band in order to hide from mobsters led by Spats Colombo (George Raft). They go to Florida for a 3 week gig and be-friend Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe), the band's singer and ukulele player. Joe makes a play for Sugar in the guise of 'Junior' while Jerry gets some attention from Osgood (Joe E Brown). However, the gangsters show up at the same hotel for a 'convention'...........The film starts at a good pace and the characters hook you in from the beginning. It's a comedy with a fun musical score and amusing script with funny lines delivered by the whole cast. There are many good moments, eg, the scenes in which Jerry and Osgood tango the night away, and the supporting cast all do well. Monroe plays dumb, Curtis plays the straight man and Lemmon steals the comedy limelight along with Joe E Brown. The film has a fun, feelgood factor - it's good but it's too long......'Nobody's perfect!'......",8,0,1,31 December 2009
Titanic," Good
","The film starts with the search for a valuable diamond that is presumed to have been lost when the Titanic sank. An old survivor, Rose (Gloria Stuart) contacts the team who are searching through the Titanic on the ocean-bed. She sits down and recounts her memories of the journey that she had and the love that she found with Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio)........oh yeah...........the ship sinks........I began watching the film determined not to cry but it all got too much and I started to well up as the credits started and the film began! Although, I think it's a good film, I feel I should mention the following points. Its way too long - scenes are drawn out and this had the effect of detaching me from the action and so lessening my emotional involvement. I thought that Kate Winslet as 'Rose' and Leonardo DiCaprio were good in the lead roles but Kate was too much of a woman. She is meant to be a 16 year old. She was far too mature. This made Jack seem a bit too boyish for her, although his look is probably right considering that Kate is meant to be 16. Having said that, Winslet's facial expressions are very good and she draws you in to what she is feeling - she conveys the despair of the situation very well. She's also pretty good with an axe! I felt that DiCaprio was likable despite his constant optimism and the rest of the cast were good.Thank goodness that the Titanic sank and gave us such a wonderful tragedy.",7,1,2,7 September 2009
Mystic River," Too long
","Jimmy's (Sean Penn) daughter is found murdered and his childhood friend Sean (Kevin Bacon) leads the murder investigation. Who is the murderer?The film starts interestingly enough with the three young boys in the first scene. However, the momentum is quickly lost as we fast forward to the future and have to work out what is going on and who is who. We then have a drawn out section of the film where nothing happens for about half an hour other than Sean Penn brooding. The cast are good - Sean Penn looks and acts like Robert de Niro, Kevin Bacon is his usual likable self while Tim Robbins gives the most interesting performance as Dave.The film doesn't need to show the violence so graphically at the end where there is also a piece of philosophical nonsense between Penn and Bacon about what would have happened if either of them had got into the car with the stranger at the beginning of the film when they were boys. It's obvious that no-one connected with the film had actually been kidnapped as a youngster. They are talking crap. Clint Eastwood directs so there is a predictable 'vigilante wins' theme to the story. But why should Penn's vigilante antics be any more acceptable than Dave's? There is also an unnecessary storyline concerning Bacon and his wife which adds nothing to the film. It was left to a friend of mine to explain to me what happens after the film has finished, ie, Bacon's character finally gets Penn. It's an OK film but it's way too long.",6,0,1,24 February 2010
All Quiet on the Western Front," Quiet at the end
","Paul (Lew Ayres) is at school when he signs up for war (World War 1). He is German. His whole class also signs up but this is only as a result of being brainwashed by ideas of glory by his foolish teacher. The whole class go to the war front where they meet a couple of old-timers including Kat (Louis Wolheim)..... How many do you think survive....? A group of boys meet a group of war-weary men. The idea of the film is to sympathize with a whole class of schoolchildren as they go to war. Unfortunately, a classroom full is too many to remember so the audience watches and wonders as to who is who. Lew Ayres is the schoolkid 'top dog' as the camera spends most time on him. Great - I know who Paul is. But who are the rest...? And that is the problem with the film in terms of cast. Louis Wolheim is memorable....but who is that other person....or that other bloke.....or him......Maybe that's the point.......The most memorable scene for me is the last image of all the new recruits marching onwards in the yuck conditions and turning around individually to face the camera. A repeat of a scene that happened earlier in the film when they were alive. A good ending.",7,1,1,12 January 2011
Donnie Darko," Weird
","Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) has schizophrenic episodes. Or are they real episodes? There's a story about an aeroplane crashing into a house, a giant rabbit and time travel but there's no point in describing the story. The writer obviously didn't think about what he was writing and the director didn't bother making the film easy to follow.This film is watchable but don't expect to understand it. You sort of realize what is going on towards the end but it is all a rather confusing mess. Hence, it is not a good film. Once it finishes, you just think 'What was that about?' and it doesn't make sense. Unless you have written the peculiar time-travel theory that the film aspires to. A whole heap of nonsense really and not as effective as it would like to be. Still, it kept me watching but I don't think it needs to be seen again.",5,2,4,3 April 2011
The Wizard of Oz," Over-rated
","Dorothy (Judy Garland) runs away with her dog, Toto, but a tornado forces her back home and blows everything upside down. When it has passed and she opens her front door, she and Toto have been transported to the Land of Oz. So begins a journey to return home on which she makes friends and has an enemy in the Wicked Witch of the West (Margaret Hamilton). Does Dorothy make it back......? The film starts and ends in black and white while the main section of the film, ie, the story that occurs in the 'Land of Oz', is told in colour. It's a good effect and it's also a nice story in that the characters that Dorothy comes across in Oz relate to people that she already knows. The Wicked Witch of the West is scary and Dorothy's red shoes have a great sparkle value. However, I found that many of the characters creeped me out, eg, the Munchkins - dressed-up midgets in garish outfits that sing and dance (slightly gross idea), - flying monkeys who serve the Wicked Witch (equally grotesque), - and the 'Tin Man', a psychological oddity (like those people who paint themselves silver and stand motionless on plinths in city centres, occasionally making a sudden movement and scaring children.) The songs are generally rubbish - in fact, the only good song is 'We're Off To See The Wizard'. I can understand why gay people like this film, but I think it's over-rated and it ends with a slice of ghastly sentimentalism. The best line comes courtesy of the Wizard: 'Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain!' - very funny.",6,1,10,1 January 2010
