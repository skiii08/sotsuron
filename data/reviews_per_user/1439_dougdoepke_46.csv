Changeling," Superb Treatment of Difficult Material
","No need to recap the plot. The movie's a superbly woven screenplay that rivets interest for full two-hours plus. I've read accounts of Northcott's killings, which the screenplay follows factually, but in a very general sense. However, I wish I knew how many of the aspersions cast on the LAPD and city government are true. The script is pretty unsparing in it's portrayal of official misdeeds. So I'm really curious. Then there's that psychiatric hospital where if you're not unhinged going in you will be coming out. Apparently that's where the authorities sent people in need of help. Thus, thanks to officialdom, it seems Christine (Jolie) has no chance of either finding her boy or surviving the experience.As a result, what starts out as a missing boy mystery turns really into an expose of LA government and related institutions. That the two themes are interwoven so effectively is a real tribute to scenarist Straczynski.Also, it looks like producer Eastwood spared little expense recreating 20's fashions and street scenes. These help lend flavor to the proceedings. Then too, I really love the cloche hats the ladies wear. And check out all those black flivvers cruising around town. I guess only jokers went into the showroom asking for a black one. In terms of cast, wisely they are largely unknowns except for Jolie and Malkovich. As a result, we're not distracted by name players in supporting roles, which allows the storyline to remain uppermost. Also, actor Harner (Northcott) strongly resembles pictures I've seen of the real serial killer. Kudos to Jolie for a carefully calibrated turn without milking the part. Likely the temptation was there given the mother's emotional strain. And big time kudos to Eastwood for assembling a crew that turns difficult material into a compelling gem.",Null,1,1,29 January 2017
Casablanca," An 'All-Time Best'-- A Critical Perspective
","I'm not sure what makes this WWII film still an all-time best. Nonetheless, I can certainly see why audiences continue to like it. But an all-time critical best should include more than audience popularity.There're a number of assets on the movie's plus side. Certainly, the effort's an outstanding production from a number of standpoints. The cast amounts to a real slice of serendipity. Aside from the compelling leads, just about every colorful Warner Bros. support player gets a turn, including that mad Russian Leonid Kinskey (the bartender). Then too, the screenplay amounts to a triumph of individual moments that happily evolve into a satisfying whole, while the script itself manages a number of well-known throw-away lines that still resonate. Moreover, direction under Mike Curtiz keeps things moving in what's often a single set (Rick's Club). Plus Curtiz has an uncanny knack of coming up with the right close-up at the right emotional time. In short, the production's a masterpiece of Hollywood craftsmanship, the elements fitting darn near perfectly together.Perhaps more importantly, the film's theme strikes a key audience chord. Rick's a wounded idealist who for cloudy reasons has closed himself off to all emotions and commitments. He's become a complete political cynic, even after fighting against the fascists in Spain. Why this has happened is not made clear (unless I missed something), but it also has to do with his unhappy affair with Ilsa (Bergmann). Now his club in Casablanca has become a gathering spot for characters of all political stripes-- Nazi, Vichy French, Free French, anti-Fascist, or plain refugees fleeing a war-torn Europe. But it's really his relationship with Ilsa and Vichy cop Renault (Rains) that's pivotal to the story's outcome.Now, there's an apparent subtext to Rick's evolution that's symbolic of events in the early stages of WWII. Rick's disengagement from politics mirrors America's tradition of isolation from European conflicts. (Note here how Rick has fought in Spain mirrors America's exception by fighting in WWI.) As a result, neither Rick nor an isolationist US makes a moral distinction between the various parties (England, France, Nazi Germany) to WWII in its earliest stages. Thus, only by overcoming his cynicism can Rick recognize the evil Nazism represents, in the same way that only by breaking out of an isolationist stance can the US combat the menace Nazism poses.Here the analogy between Rick's behavior and US policy breaks down. As I see it, Rick comes to see Victor's (Henreid) anti-Nazi moral value through his recurring love for Ilsa, even though Ilsa is married now to Victor. But if Ilsa is willing to sacrifice her happiness so that Victor can lead people against the Nazis, then Rick the cynic must reckon with Victor's ultimate moral worth. And by so doing, he recovers his own moral compass, which in a noble act of selflessness, enables the married couple to return to the European struggle. Thus Rick has taken a stand just as the US would do.I think this is a satisfying climax to events, but it wouldn't be nearly so memorable without the foggy airport staging, and cop Renault rejecting his Vichy authority and departing with Rick into what may be the 'Beginning of a beautiful friendship'. Both have now seen the light even amidst the foggy future.Now, if ranking movies were simply about craftsmanship, I'd rate Casablanca one of the best. But all-around bests have to include more than craftsmanship. There is an essential area where I think the movie falls short. That is, it's tied very much to its time period. Finding a moral compass may be a universal challenge, and in that sense, a human condition. But here finding that compass is tied too specifically to the historical evils of Nazism, not to a more trans-historical condition that would have universal application.In that specific regard, compare Casablanca with 1951's award winning A Place In The Sun. Both are expertly cast and produced. However, it's hard to think of the 1942 movie without thinking specifically of the Nazis as the catalyst. The 1951 film, on the other hand, concerns no particular time period. Instead, it's about the corruptive appeal of wealth and glamour on a particular individual (Monty Clift's character). The seductions of wealth and power, of course, are trans-historical. So, the lasting impression of that movie has application now as well as then, even though the ending, unlike Casablanca, is no crowd-pleaser.My overall point is not to derogate the 1942 film. It remains a triumph of studio movie- making. On the other hand, I don't think it qualifies as an all-time critical best, even if it does star filmdom's favorite covert idealist, Humphrey Bogart.",Null,0,2,9 March 2015
Lifeboat," Close-in Drama
","No need to recap the plot.As a commentary on WWII and Nazis, the film is dated; as an allegory on democratic individualism, the movie's still relevant. The survivors, excepting Nazi Slezak, represent a cross-section of American society, from the upper-class Bankhead to the working class Bendix, including black man Lee, and by innuendo, communist Hodiak. How these representative types thrown together manage to coordinate under lifeboat conditions drives the storyline.For example, note how prosperous businessman Hull assumes command without democratic procedure. Of course, there does need to be a division of duties so what needs to get done gets done. Moreover, he would be the logical choice since he heads factories, but he does not put it to a vote. Instead, he simply assumes the right. However, after a number of difficulties, Hodiak takes command by democratic consent, and I wonder if this too implies a political judgement on writer Steinbeck's part. In addition are the inevitable complications among the survivors including budding romances and class rivalries.However, once Nazi Slezak is taken aboard, moral questions arise about what to do with an enemy captain. Being a Nazi during wartime means, of course, that Slezak can't be trusted, and indeed he has a number of tricks up his sleeve. But being the only sailor aboard, his seamanship has to be weighed against his politics. This sets up an interesting dilemma that the survivors must ponder. Only Hodiak senses the danger of putting him in charge of the boat's course. And again I wonder if this is Steinbeck's commentary on pre-war American politics when Americans tended to be apathetic about the Third Reich menace. However, that may be, the resolution remains a violent stunner.Despite 90-minutes of a confined stage, Hitch makes things interesting with his targeted close-ups and other visual ploys. The acting too is first-rate, and I'm particularly impressed by Bankhead. Her headstrong personality is riveting. Too bad she didn't make more movies, her preference apparently being the stage. Anyway, the movie has dated in many ways, but still poses the question of how to coordinate in extreme conditions among a diverse group of people. It's not front-rank Hitchcock, but remains worthwhile for that reason.",Null,1,1,29 September 2013
Chinatown," Noir Without the Code
","An LA p.i. gets caught up with a spider woman and a land stealing scheme that uses water diversion during a drought.In short, the movie's the best noir since the genre's golden age. From muted colors to shaded performances to uncompromised ending, the movie's a worthy successor to the 40's classics. And that's despite the 130-minute length, twice the average. Plus, director Polanski doesn't have to meet Code requirements that compromised many a 40's feature. Thus, we get an ending that befits the general storyline, no matter how much of a downer it is for the audience.Note that amidst a prevaricating world, Nicholson's J.J. Gittes is no noble truth-seeker in the manner of a Marlowe or a Spade. Instead, he's in it strictly for the money. So when he's trapped in the spider woman's (Dunaway) little web of deceit, it's hard to feel sympathy. In fact, Gittes is neither very likable in personality, methods or ethics. Thus, it's a tribute to screenwriter Towne that we stay involved with the storyline, despite the general absence of anybody to identify with. Then too, the plot is not so much a mystery or whodunit as it is a web of intrigue leading to someone or somewhere. That central referent of 'Chinatown' remains something of a puzzler. I interpret it as a place where bad things are done in the name of the good while everyone ignores the discrepancy. Thus, the ironical ending.Anyhow, the movie's a first-rate noir that makes a lasting impression, and as an LA resident I'm reminded to check my lawn. I think it needs water.",Null,2,3,18 November 2013
To Be or Not to Be," Shakespeare Does Hitler
","A troupe of Polish actors impersonate Nazis in order to prevent the Polish underground from being captured.Jack Benny used to joke on radio and TV about his movie career, especially The Horn Blows at Midnight (1945). But he never joked about this film. Though it's got a serious subject right on the eve of WWII, it's still pretty funny, especially when Jack pulls his egotistical, great actor bit. With all the Heil Hitlers and Gestapo boys running around, it's sometimes hard to keep up with who's who. Nonetheless, it's a clever screenplay having an actors' troupe impersonate Nazi's. Aside from TV's Hogan's Heroes (1965-1971), I don't know of any other show that risked making fun of the murderous Third Reich. It's a pretty tricky topic to begin with, but the production crew pulls it off.Then there's Carole Lombard, on the eve of her tragic plane ride. But she's still delicious as heck. Plus, I could swear that silken gown she's got on for her tryst is all she's got on. My eyes were glued. Also, it's easy to catch a young, love-struck Robert Stack before he got out of the movie's second row and moved into the hard case cop on TV's The Untouchables (1959-1963). Note too, the unspoken Jewish subtext, with the names of many of the victims and Shylock's moving plea from Shakespeare. I don't know why the script made do with inference rather than a single overt mention of Nazism's virulent anti-Semitism. Maybe it's because that might sound like special pleading, regardless of the merits.Anyway, it's still a pretty funny movie, and remains an offbeat one-of-a-kind. Besides Benny had a much better film career than he wanted to admit.",Null,1,3,9 March 2013
Monty Python's Life of Brian," CB DeMille It Ain't
","Okay, after 250 comments what's left to say. Personally, I took the movie as a send-up of those god-awful biblical costume epics of the 1950's. One's like The Silver Chalice (1954) or David and Bathsheba (1951), et al. You know, the kind that gave you 90 minutes of sex and violence and then 10 minutes of redeeming religiosity spread on with a trowel. That way you could enjoy the fun stuff without guilt, and Hollywood could show it had gotten rid of all those Commie screenwriters of the 1940's.I don't know how they did it, but this is the most realistic looking Holy Land that I've seen— the parched countryside, the magnificent battlements, the ragged crowds, etc. The budget couldn't have been that big, but the settings are impressive in their realism—not what you'd expect from a send-up like this.Anyway, it's a funny movie. And if it doesn't exactly end with the voice of God, it does end on a humorously ironic note—all those crucifees hanging there, singing 'Look on the Bright Side of Life'. Beneath the black humor, there may well be real wisdom, and who's to say that this is not, in its own way, a voice from above.",Null,1,3,23 April 2010
Mississippi Burning," A Few Remarks
","Gripping account of 1964 murder of three civil rights workers. In retrospect, it's ironic how the executions and burials backfired on the segregationists. The missing workers got a lot of publicity, extending over months, not just days, thereby focusing national attention on the segregationist South. Had the bodies been discovered sooner, I expect the impact would have been less. How ironic for the KKK.Hackman's sly ex-sheriff turned FBI man dominates the film. Charming one minute, resolute the next, he's a good foil for DaFoe's by-the-book chief investigator. I'm in no position to evaluate the movie's details, but the dramatic values more than compensate for a lengthy run-time. I'm so glad the producers used a plain Frances McDormand in the feminine lead rather than some glamor-puss. Plus, she really delivers in a poignant role. Filming on location also provides real color and authenticity to impoverished conditions. Can't help noticing, in passing, that Blacks don't smile when they see adversity strike the KKK. After decades of oppression, that seems odd. I wonder if that was an authentic response or the movie makers' idea.My only reservation is with the brief interviews. How did the interviewees decide what to say since all appear to young to have been mature in 1964. Oh well, that's a minor point in what amounts to a splendidly produced historical drama that should not be passed up.",Null,3,4,10 November 2014
12 Angry Men," One Room Powerhouse
","Making a movie of a stage play is difficult enough. After all, movies are supposed to have many scene changes, whereas plays typically have only a few. This one, however, has basically none, except for a brief opening and close. Besides, most movies have eye appeal, usually good-looking people, especially girls. This one, however, has none. Just 12 ordinary looking guys, without a girl in sight. So how do you hold audience interest with such a spare format. Above all, you better have darn good actors and a darn good screenplay. Good thing the movie does.I like the way director Lumet keeps the jurors moving around in the little room. That way there's some action, and often the movement is expressive of how the juror feels about the deliberations. No doubt about it, the cast is a powerhouse of familiar faces from that period. Some low-key their performance, like Fonda, Balsam, and Klugman; others are familiar loud- mouths, like Begley and Cobb. So is the kid guilty or not. If so, it's 10,000 volts in the Big House. Besides, it doesn't help the kid that he's a poor minority, at least in the minds of some jurors. No doubt about it, for better or worse, there's a basically liberal sentiment at work in the screenplay.As the script shows, most of the guys just want to get back to their routines even though a lot's at stake. Besides, the evidence appears open and shut. So, on first ballot, it's 11 for guilty and just 1 for not (Fonda). What is he, a trouble-maker or something. No. He just thinks the evidence is not as damning as first appears, and they all need to examine it more closely. Good thing he's not running for office. Showing how the 11 get eventually whittled down to 0 is what the movie's about. In the process, some like Begley and Cobb reveal a lot about their private selves, while others are simply open to the doubts that begin to open up.The deck is somewhat stacked in terms of likability. The biggest holdouts for guilty are the least likable, except Juror #4 (Marshall) who operates on logic alone. Fortunately, Fonda's low-key, reasonable manner is not off-putting as a know-it-all; instead, he's mainly a catalyst sparking contributions from others. I guess my only reservation is with giving the jury only two choices—'guilty' or 'not guilty'. Seems to me, on the basis of the evidence, the proper conclusion would be 'not proved', since the kid may well have done it. However, the evidence does not prove that he did, at least not beyond the metric of 'reasonable doubt'. All in all, a nice plot twist.Anyway, the movie's a showcase of ensemble acting that rivets audience interest despite the limitations in staging. Too bad it wasn't recognized at the time as the classic it is.",Null,1,2,26 January 2014
Ed Wood," How Ironic!
","Two hours and I didn't get up once. Of course, I've laughed along with thousands of others at Wood's totally inept productions, except I'd never gotten around to catching this flick. No doubt this is the best movie Wood's name has ever attached to. Depp's likable never-say-die buoyancy carries the benighted Wood from one fiasco to the next. If sheer drive converted into talent, Wood would replace his idol Orson Welles as cinema's top dog. But then reality is no problem if you just ignore it. I love that near riot scene at the premiere of Bride of the Gorilla. Does that dampen Wood's artistic confidence—not a whit. In my book, Depp deserved the Oscar, hands down.Speaking of Oscars, Landau too deserved one. His resemblance to the real Lugosi is uncanny. Plus, he manages the touching moments of a has-been monster in really poignant fashion. And get a load of Vampira (Lisa Marie). I wanted to snuggle up and run at the same time. What the movie does in spades is show the fringes of the Hollywood glamor factory, with its many colorful characters. I especially like Wood's run-ins with the tyrannical schlock-meister who insists he only does 'crap'. Sounds like real behind-the-scenes candor. At the same time, the movie doesn't include Wood's seamy battle with alcohol or the rat-traps he was reduced to living in. The narrative's really about his professional career rather than his personal life.Nonetheless, the two-hours remain a highly entertaining look at an amazing personality, who never took 'no' for an answer. And, oh yes, there's the movie's big irony—Edward D. Wood Jr. did become famous, after all.",Null,2,2,14 December 2015
The Hustler," Spotty
","No need to recap the plot.Despite the hype of the time and Newman in a tailor-made role, the movie is spotty at best. Altogther, there may be 90-minutes of usable material, but stretched to over 2-hours, the pacing drags, particularly in the middle part. Writer-director Rossen inserts too many unnecessary pauses long after we've gotten the idea. For example, Sarah's (Laurie) alcoholic stagger down a city street goes on for a minute when 10-seconds would suffice. Then there are the many dialog pauses in the Eddie-Sarah conflabs. These may imitate life, but here they simply drag out the scenes pointlessly. Maybe if Sarah had more than a single drearily predictable personality, there might be more interest to the scenes and what she says. However, as things stand, her one-note character blows a hole right through the movie's middle.The film's strength lies in a raft of colorful supporting players, including the underrated Murray Hamilton who injects just the right amount of oily decadence into his Southern gentleman. Newman at the time was one of Hollywood's hottest properties. His rebellious role here was a near perfect fit for what would become his definitive screen image, though I agree that his Fast Eddie is not very likable and without the compensatory charm of a Hud or Cool Hand Luke.If my little review seems weighted with negatives, it's because I think the movie's overrated, and needs some deflation. Reputations can sometimes be misleading, especially now that the initial hype has worn off. At the same time, the hype was somewhat understandable since Hollywood was promoting more adult features like this one to escape the deadening hand of 1950's conformity. At its best, The Hustler's a good series of colorful character studies; at its least, however, it's slow and repetitive and far short of a classic.(In passing— for a sports movie, the action here is an oddity. Most sports films mine the moment-to-moment suspense of a crucial play. But there's none of that here. That is, we get no close-ups of crucial moments when winning or losing is in the balance. Rather, the detail in the games between Fast Eddie and Fats is skipped over in cursory fashion. The narrative's only interested in the overall outcome without playing up the suspense. I suspect that's because the rules of pool are not widely known, plus the action itself is too visually chaotic for an audience to easily follow. Anyway, I found the absence unusual for a sports movie.)",Null,6,11,24 June 2012
L.A. Confidential," Keep a Score Card Handy, but It's Worth It
","Ordinarily a '2-hour+' movie with an equally dense storyline would give me the shudders. But I have to admit that these folks manage to bring it off in riveting style, even though the many narrative threads don't merge until the end. To that point, I was keeping a scorecard to track the characters and plot, that is, unless somebody was taking a slug to the gut, which was pretty much every few minutes.I've got to admit that this movie may have the single most stunning moment that I've experienced in 60-odd years of movie watching. I don't know anything about director Hanson, but he manages that scene, plus the whole ball of wax, in really expert style, worthy of the best of the craft.What lingers for me is what the movie says about one of the most popular TV shows of the early 1950's. In those days, Jack Webb's Dragnet pretty much took audiences, myself included, by storm, as it portrayed police work in near documentary style. More importantly the episodes were proudly set in Los Angeles with the announced cooperation of that city's police force. The movie's Vincennes (Spacey) character is clearly intended to be an adviser to that TV show. So a comment is pretty much also intended.Needless to say, the cops of Dragnet were portrayed as nothing less than professional in both attitude and behavior. As a result, police work was so defined for a whole generation of young Americans. However, if even one-tenth of this movie's script is to be believed, then what do we say about the integrity of that long-ago police drama or about the beliefs that so many of us held to. Not a pretty prospect.Anyway, the movie's a darn good neo-noir done in convincing period fashion. And for geezers like myself, it was fun seeing again the styles of my youth.",Null,0,1,18 March 2012
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Humor Makes The Pill Go Down
","No need to repeat consensus on the movie's general brilliance. As I recall, Kubrick's withering black humor created quite a stir, coming in the midst of Cold War conformity. In loony jest, it even suggests our leaders might be no better (maybe even worse) than the perfidious Soviets. Needless to say, that appeared unpatriotic to many. Nevertheless, it's the inspired lunacy of the acting and writing that makes this bitter pill go down. What stays with me is the movie's obsessive attention to technical detail, whether switch flipping in Kong's bomber, communication set-ups stateside, or the War Room's big board. Lying at the core is that utter contrast between technological expertise, on one hand, and mocking lunacy of the guys in charge, on the other. What the movie seems to say, if you will, is that the same collective intelligence that can create technical marvels is too wacko to use them intelligently. I suspect the lesson still applies, as the movie cleverly implies.",Null,3,4,5 May 2017
The Best Years of Our Lives," A 40's Blockbuster
","And to think that the damaged veteran part almost went to pretty boy Farley Granger. Consider what that would have done to the movie's heartfelt appeal. Without real life amputee Harold Russell, the film would exchange real life impact for Hollywood glamour. After all, it's the ordinary looking Russell's coping with genuine disfigurement that lifts the film beyond the merely well done. Granger's a capable actor, but clearly shouts Hollywood in a film dedicated instead to Every Town, USA.The first hour's compelling as the three vets return home to find out how much home has changed and how much they've changed. I like the way the three bond as they meet on their way home. That kind of war bonding can't be duplicated by relationships of civilian life, no matter how sensitively rendered. This part is persuasively written and acted. The second hour deals mainly with adjustments of finding a job, sorting out problems, and settling back into civilian routine. The last hour, however, drifts into standard Hollywood soap opera, except for the one scene showing how Homer (Russell) gets ready for bed. I doubt that such a mundane act has ever been more memorably presented.All in all, the movie's well-acted and non-glamorously staged, as it should be. Of course, the movie's also a revealing time capsule of the post-war period, at least of how film-makers would like it to be. Sure, the movie's optimistic in outlook, but then I dare say that's what the audience wanted following five years of war induced trauma. Above all, it's the occasionally rich human-interest that continues the film's basic appeal, even seventy-years later.",Null,1,1,16 February 2015
Battleship Potemkin," Dynamic Masterpiece
","It's sixty-six minutes of perhaps the most arresting imagery in movie history, also one of the most dynamic. Every shot includes movement of some kind, whether people, smoke, guns, or the prow of history overtaking us. There's no scene of focal conversation, let alone silent talk. Thus politics of revolt remain largely unregistered. Instead the symbolism of rotten meat force-fed to sailors sums up crumbling Tsarist rule. The revolt is told in compelling movement, crowds rushing to and fro, Tsarist forces ahead or behind. One after another, the human wave cascades, with hardly time to breathe. Surely, the Odessa Steps is one of the most memorable in all moviedom; at the same time, a common humanity is deepened-- the dead baby, the shattered eyeglasses. Yes, the 1905 revolt failed. But seed was planted taking down Tsarist rule but ten years later. No need to go on—the film's brilliance is there for all to see, and remains so though not a word is spoken.

Taxi Driver," Existentialist's Top Ten
","I doubt the 2-hours is a favorite of NYC's chamber of commerce. The grime and sin fairly drip off the screen-- location filming on the streets being a big, big plus. Poor cabbie Bickle, he's trapped in his own isolation and can't decide whether to break out or celebrate. He'd like to connect with high class Betsy, but he's too self enclosed to realize his porn movies are an insult to her. Then too, he'd like to affirm conventional values by rescuing little Iris from life on the street. But she's too much in love with her pimp, a part of the city filth which he takes care of with an angry gun. Hailed now by the cops and public as a hero, he nevertheless falls back into isolation as passengers come and go from his private cab. Still, he's done his bit to clean up the city. Now he can drive at ease within his self-enclosure. Perhaps the moral is we're each condemned to live inside our own cab. Or is his problem more simply an instance of urban neglect.Heckuva job by Scorsese and Co. that holds fast audience interest even minus a storyline. Instead, it's an account of one man's struggle inside an alienating environment, and actor DeNiro triumphs in a darn difficult role. In fact, he's in about every scene, so there's plenty of chances to fail.No need to go on; 1000+ reviews says it all. Nonetheless, I nominate the movie for existentialism's hall of movie fame.

Full Metal Jacket," Kubrick Should Have Stopped While He Was Ahead
","Unfortunately, Metal Jacket shows the brilliant Kubrick in decline, and a long way from his anti-war masterpiece Paths of Glory (1958). All in all, and despite some telling episodes, this 2-hours adds up to a rather pointless exercise in wartime experience. Certainly, the first half is undeniable in its powerful expose of Marine Basic Training and the dehumanizing effect. At the same time, contrasting its honest depiction of combat training with the heavily sanitized depictions from such 1950's counterparts as Take the High Ground (1953) or Battle Cry (1955) shows how much truth-telling in the movie industry movie had improved in 30-years. Still and all, the movie halves do not match up well. I see the problem as lying with a script, and its inability to etch its characters strongly enough (excepting the ill-fated Ermey and Pyle) to bridge the gap and pull us into their battlefield predicament. At the same time, we only get a sporadic picture of the one continuing character, Private Joker (Modine). Perhaps, the best Vietnam part is listening to how the head of Stars and Stripes skews journalistic coverage in a propagandistic direction. So, it wasn't just folks at home being misled by their media, but troops in the field by theirs, as well. Anyway, the visuals are hellish in their fiery depiction of the battle for Hue. Then too, it comes as a real surprise that the sniper is a woman, the embodiment, I guess, of what the North meant by their motto 'People's War'. Looks to me, also, that Kubrick and co. had little idea of how to end the 2-hours. So we get a strident male chorus of a children's song, no less, as the platoon stumbles through a twilight world. Whatever else, that imagery does manage to symbolize the war in general.All in all, however, the movie suffers in comparison to such other Vietnam flicks as Platoon (1986) or Apocalypse Now (1979). Too bad Kubrick wasn't 20-years younger when he made this two films in one.",Null,0,1,6 January 2014
The Grapes of Wrath," Worth a Closer Look
","Those shacks with their scrawny kids and threadbare mothers are right out of a Dorothea Lange photo essay of the Great Depression. Now, I'm no particular fan of director Ford, but he does nail this social protest film, which remains an affecting classic even 70-years later. Production notes indicate Ford had to battle TCF to get as much realism into the movie as he did. Yet, without those revealing touches, the dramatic impact would be sorely undercut.What impresses me is the similarity of conditions between then and now, that is, between the great Depression of the 1930's and the Great Recession (housing bubble) of the 2000's. Instead of a stock market collapse and a rural Dust Bowl, our era has seen a collapse of housing prices and a loss of jobs that has wiped out trillions in home-owner wealth. The collapse has created a new class of dispossessed as banks move in to repossess overdue mortgages. At the same time, the unemployed hope to find a job before government compensation runs out.In the movie, uprooted families pack up and move west to new horizons, living in tumble- down shacks along the way. Nowadays, uprooted families are either homeless or live in cars, there being scant new horizons to move to. Meanwhile, nameless bankers and Wall Streeters hover in the moneyed background, profiting off the general misery from behind gated communities. The movie goes easy on the contrast between the few rich and the many poor, but the implications remain embedded in the screenplay, especially when the sheriff evicts the sharecroppers from the land.This brief comparison is not meant to be political. Rather, it's meant to suggest that certain economic dynamics are still with us, even 70-years later, a parallel making the movie's social topic as relevant now as it was then. Of course, as yet there's no Steinbeck or Ford to dramatize the plight in the moving way of the novel or the film. But then, this new era of collapse is still pretty young.The film itself remains a triumph of casting, staging, and scripting. It's really Ma Joad's (Darwell) film, her strength and sensitivity a stand-in for migrant resilience as a whole. I'm so glad Ford refused to prettify her appearance in any fashion. Fonda too provides just the right humorless edge, that of a good man rendered an outlaw by onerous conditions of the time. Carradine's preacher may be the most interesting of the characters. Having lost 'The Call', he's a lost soul amidst the general collapse of all that was familiar. Yet, he retains the capacities of a visionary leader, someone who can help guide the new Israelites into a land of milk and honey. It's part of the movie's tragic sense of dislocation that his new understanding is cut short. Among many memorable scenes, my favorite is the kids at the roadside diner. The hash- house waitress is a typical sassy type, used to fending off jibes from weary truckers. So, when the deal-making Pa Joad comes in with his two hungry kids, she's at first resistant. But then with the cook pushing, her resistance gives way to the humane person underneath. At the same time, the sentiment proves infectious. And instead of the diner losing money by befriending the needy Joads, the truckers leave a sizable tip. In short, a layer of everyday life is peeled back to show a seldom seen solidarity beneath.To me, not everything is roses. Ford shows his penchant for broad character humor with Grandpa Joad (Grapewin). I know Grandpa is supposed to be borderline senile; however, his overdone antics threaten to undercut the movie's concern with realistic effects. Also, the waitress's scene ending tribute to the generous truckers is unnecessary. Letting the audience grasp the humane gesture would have been more effective.Nonetheless, these are small blemishes within a beautifully wrought canvas. My lingering image is the final shot of Tom as he crosses the skyline, a silhouette of the reformist spirit now loose upon the land. My hope is there are many Tom Joads still among us.",Null,3,4,26 December 2011
The Aviator," No Favor to Hughes
","Say what you want about the old studio biopics that often turn up on cable channels. They were too often schmaltzy, shameless, and as historically accurate as a politician's memory. But at least they knew how to tell a story and make it interesting. On the other hand, The Aviator replaces story line with jumbled imagery, dialogue with rapid-fire editing, and a heavy-weight subject with a light-weight actor who gets serious by scowling and stamping his foot as any 12-year old might. Surely Hughes deserves better, I know the audience does. The moral is that no amount of fiddling with period detail or special effects can make up for a chaotic core. Shame on you, Martin Scorsese for lending your good name to this cinematic mess.",Null,1,2,24 November 2014
The Bourne Identity," So Where Are The Good Guys
","The movie reminds me of a Hitchcock thriller. Of course, Hitch filmed during a period of much slower tempo, and would likely have emphasized emotional psychology over slam-bang action. Still, it's a heckuva thriller. Bourne's got more lives than a cat, and he'd better. That's because a secret agency of the US gov't has got him in their sights. Seems the poor guy was an assassin for them, but on one assignment got shot, thrown into the sea, and lost his memory. Now he's trying to find out who he is, but in the process is jeopardizing agency plans for something or other. So now they're using all their techno-wizardry to take him out. It's like banks and banks of blinking circuits on his trail. From Bourne's standpoint, it's like he's up against an entire unseen universe. Good thing he's got as many tricks up his sleeve as the agents tracking him.I guess you could say this isn't exactly a promotional for our covert agencies. Their bureaucrats appear ruthless and unforgiving, especially headman Conklin whose neck is on the line. On the other hand, I think we sympathize more with Bourne than like him, given the bloody trail he leaves behind. Still, I like the way the screenplay eases him into the relationship with Marie, making it more credible. What I do have reservations about is that over-long and incredible car chase. Seems to me that careful use of a less can ironically add up to a significant more, a lesson this sequence needs to apply. Anyway, Damon's persuasive despite his boyish looks, while Potente gets to show her chops and in fairly subtle fashion. All in all, the movie's a white-knuckle two hours. It also registers a popular change in how audiences view our gov't's covert agencies, plus the slimy politicians who pitch for them.",Null,1,1,12 February 2017
The Caine Mutiny," Strawberry Shortcake is Less Dangerous
","Powerhouse acting makes this sea drama a gripping tale of mutiny aboard ship. The interaction between the chief officers—MacMurray, Johnson, and Bogart is especially compelling, as Queeg (Bogart) descends slowly into madness. The underlying question is whether Queeg would have cracked had his staff officers given him better support. MacMurray (Keefer) gets the unenviable role as the slippery schemer, which he is. But he's also the one who most perceptively spots Queeg's unstable judgment.This is one of Bogart's signature roles; at the same time, Queeg's obsession with the missing strawberries was widely parodied by comics of the time. Watching him slowly unravel on the witness stand amounts to one of Hollywood's acting high points. Then too, someone in authority had the good sense to keep the sometimes distractive romantic subplot—Keith and Wynn— from interfering with the main story. Too bad the boyish Francis' life was cut so short. Here he performs admirably as the idealistic young shavetail. My only gripe is Ferrer's smugly overweening portrayal of lawyer Greenwald. His pompous diatribe at movie's end is less an indictment of the staff officers than a showboat for an Oscar-winning actor who doesn't appear until the movie's almost over and is making up for it.All in all, the drama's human element—plus the really well done typhoon—remains compelling despite the years. I guess, that audiences of that day were right in making the movie the box office hit it was.",Null,0,1,25 November 2012
The Shining," Fatally Flawed
","If The Shining were about camera work and atmosphere only, it would rank with Kubrick's best, which is to say about as good as the movies get. To Kubrick's hand-held camera and cinematic imagination, the hotel's vast empty corridors and adjacent rooms become a labyrinth of horror in which evil of any kind might emerge. Only The Sixth Sense, of recent vintage, comes close to capturing the same spooky anything-can-happen atmosphere of the Shining's Overlook Hotel. If the film were about script only, it would still rate an arguable 5 stars, as Kubrick & Co. substitute mood and spectral apparitions in place of the book's hokier parts, such as flying topiary. Nor do I think the film is overlong, since a leisurely buildup is essential to the crashing, mind-altering climax.But this is not the early Kubrick, the sure-hand behind Paths of Glory, Dr. Strangelove, or 2001. This is Kubrick in decline. A director who either cannot or will not control the wild excesses of his celebrity-star Jack Nicholson in the film's pivotal role. In a part that fairly cries out for sublety and nuance, especially in limning the descent into madness, we get instead a leering, smirking self parody of an actor obviously wallowing in a chance to pull out all stops. And who can believe that that dreadful mood-killing line, 'Here'sss Johnny!' is actually in the script. Rarely has such a grossly self-indulgent performance been allowed to reach the screen in unaltered form. And for that, there is only Kubrick to ultimately blame.I realize I risk offending Nicholson's legion of fans for whom this 'cool dude' can do no wrong. But the fact is he traded in his acting credentials soon after Cuckoo's Nest for the easier road of self-parody, in which the silk purse of Five Easy Pieces becomes the sow's ear of the typical Nicholson Role. I care because in more disciplined hands - say an Anthony Hopkins - this could have been a great movie, instead of the artistic irritant it finally is.",Null,7,17,11 April 2011
Duck Soup," Words Can't Manage
","Lunacy from start to finish. The routines never cease and almost all are belly laughs, at least for us Marxists. There's something of a plot, which happily never gets in the way. It's something about Groucho's country of Freedonia and a rivalry with Calhern's Sylvania. Meanwhile zillionaire matron Dumont is the dubious prize. Naturally, the boys comically foil every plot to snatch her away. Trouble is words don't come close to capturing the non-stop lunacy of the 70-minutes. What's generally overlooked, however, is how well produced the feature is. The royal hall is huge, well decorated, and staffed with armies of costumed extras. Thankfully, Paramount cut few corners and it shows. And catch that mass scene of squirming bodies near the end that borders on a surreal even as the routines continue. Comic highlights include the famous mirror scene, getting hats on straight at the hotdog stand, and Groucho's many throwaway lines. I can just imagine what it was like trying to direct this madness from a director's chair. Whatever they paid McCarey, it wasn't enough.Anyway, the boys are in top form including the uncertain Zeppo before he wisely became a Hollywood talent agent. So, for younger folks, don't miss the well-crafted 1933 craziness. As the goofiness shows, surreal comedy didn't begin with the wacko likes of Bill Murray, Jim Carey, or even The Three Stooges!",Null,2,4,16 July 2015
The Battle of Algiers," Superb Treatment of Difficult Material
","Superbly done in all aspects. In years of movie viewing I've never seen staged events look so realistic. I don't know how Pontecorvo and Co. managed it, but they did. I first saw the movie in a packed LA theatre in 1967. The place absolutely rocked when the FLN vowed to continue their struggle— shades of the anti-Vietnam war then shaping up. I guess the colonial French learned their lesson in Vietnam and Algeria, a lesson neo-colonial Americans are still learning. Anyway, there's not much I can add to the hundreds of reviews already in place. That is, except to say that what stayed and still stays with me are the peasant faces, etched by years of hardship. Plus, the native quarters with their claustrophobic passageways that resemble a prison more than a neighborhood. No way Hollywood can duplicate these. Thanks Mr. Pontecorvo and all the others for a world-class lesson in movie making and difficult truths.",Null,1,2,16 April 2017
Gone with the Wind," Neither Best Nor Worst
","Contrary to IMDb's many pro or con reviews, the movie is neither America's best nor worst. In fact, this is the only film I can think of where that truism might usefully apply. One thing for sure— whatever one thinks of the film, it is likely America's best-known movie. Anyway, after 500+ reviews, there's no need for detail, so let me summarize.On the plus side. The cast amounts to perfect visual counterparts of their characters. Whatever you think of his or her performance, can you visualize anyone but Gable as Rhett or Leigh as Scarlett, etc. Also, the historical sweep is filmed in striking Technicolor. The fiery reds, glowing golds, and dusky darker shades lend considerable eye and emotional appeal. Then too, the musical score is outstanding and shrewdly applied, especially Tara's Theme. Finally, the drama has all the elements of effective soap opera—a long-suffering heroine, a handsome manly hero, and an assortment of well-etched supporting players. In sum, as spectacle, the film is lavishly and effectively produced.On the minus side. The 4-hour run time is definitely too long, even for lavishly assembled soap opera. I expect the large number of script writers, both credited and uncredited, has much to do with that. Either way, 240-minutes is much too much for any one sitting. But, most importantly and most damningly, Gone With The Wind, whatever else, does its best to prettify a lie. Now, there's no need to go into the movie's nostalgic treatment of the slave- holding Old South or its bitter, one-sided treatment of the Union North. These cosmetic features are all too obvious and have become more decisive over the decades in judging the movie's worth. Certainly, that's the case with the negative reviews on this site.Now, the larger issue of whether a movie can be legitimately enjoyed apart from its politics is too complex for this context. Instead, consider how American audiences would react were British rule over the American colonies romanticized in a similar spectacular and personal way. This is not intended to equate the Confederate South with British colonial rule, but the thought experiment does, I think, illustrate an important point.Anyway, in my little book, this most celebrated of American movies remains an over-long and badly flawed spectacle that ironically attracts and repels at the same time. Perhaps that's why the film continues to occupy such a central place in our movie history.",Null,2,6,26 February 2012
Tigerland," Flawed
","This appears to be a message movie, but the message gets lost in an unsteady screenplay that can't seem to decide where it's going. Too bad, because the Boz character is fascinating, while several scenes are powerfully done. One problem is that the time and place is very specific, Fort Polk, 1971. By that time, the Vietnam war had become highly politicized even among rank and file soldiers, while peace symbols sprouted everywhere. The military was facing a growing mutiny as discipline was breaking down both at home and abroad.Now the logical thing would be to connect Boz's rebelliousness to the anti-war movement. That would explain what otherwise remains vague-- his reasons for bucking the system. However, there are only passing references to the crisis then facing the military professionals. Thus, a very politicized period is de-politicized, leaving Boz's rebellion with a purely personal and unexplained attitude. So, as the rather incredible ending shows and despite his previous behavior, Boz never had anything principled against the war or even the military (though he understands its de- humanizing methods). Instead, he responds to the demands of friendship (Paxton) and an unselfish desire not to have someone else risk death in his place. Thus, he emerges at the end as something of a mythologized Christ figure which is why the script leaves his fate so uncertain. As a result, what started out as a message movie ends rather confusingly as a character study. At the same time, the anti-military message morphs abruptly into a pro-war apology to the training sergeant-- a disastrous move for the film as a whole.There's another shift that undercuts the cumulative impact. The original conflict is that between Boz and the army as he skirts regulations, disrespects his superiors, and returns recruits to civilian life who should be returned. But halfway through, the conflict morphs into a struggle between Boz and the unbalanced Wilson. The trouble is that this personal feud isolates the conflict causing the story to lose further focus such that no clear message or impact emerges at the end. This is a movie of parts, whose sum-total unfortunately undermines the whole.I suspect the movie had either limited theatrical release or went right to cable. That's too bad, because with clearer concepts the result could have been memorable. Several of the scenes are really strong, especially the personal confessions. They're movingly done and by relatively unknown actors. Also the filming techniques (staging, camera set-ups, etc.) are excellent and help compensate for the muddled script. Unfortunately, however, they can't salvage the basic flaws in how the story develops.",Null,1,4,11 September 2008
1941," God Awful
","Arguably, the worst A-budget movie ever made. It is to the average movie what a splatter painting is to a Rembrandt. For the same money blown up by these clowns, a hundred decent films could have been made. It's like some nutjob at Paramount gave 35-million to a bunch of 12-year olds and told them to blow it up real good. Except they blew it up real bad. I don't know what this nitroglycerin mess was reaching for, but it's like nothing I've seen in some 65-years of movie watching. Apparently, impresario Spielberg was suffering from a temporary lobotomy, proving I guess that even the best can have periods of blackout. He should be glad there's no law against cinematic crimes like this, otherwise he'd be in the Big House. All in all, the mindless repetition is about as funny as two-hours of world destruction where no one feels pain except the audience. No need to go on. Words, as they say, don't begin to suffice.

JFK," A Brief Reminder
","Regardless of the politics, this is a powerful movie. The acting is first-rate, along with production values that insist on actual locales where possible. Three hours is a burden on the rear end no matter how good the film, but this one manages to hold attention throughout. The Kennedy assassination continues to fascinate, I think, because of the many threads running through it that point in several different directions.The movie itself makes a strong case for a government-led conspiracy. A brief review, however, is hardly the place to argue the merits of Garrison's case or conspiracy in general. Nonetheless, the movie succeeds in bringing to popular attention a number of holes in the Warren Commission's lone assassin theory. Crucially, however, it's well to keep in mind that filmmaking is an art and by its nature art deals with images. Now, images can be a reflection of reality, and in that sense function as an expression of truth. But imagery, of course, is not reality itself. As a result, art as a source of truth about the world, has an inbuilt limitation.I mention this caveat only as a general caution about movies in general, and not to discredit this film in particular. All in all, I think the movie represents pretty powerfully many of the key facts of key eyewitnesses involved in the most intriguing murder case of the century. Thus, the film should not be missed, whatever one's persuasion.",Null,2,9,26 March 2013
Caddyshack," Needs More Gopher
","Mildly amusing outdoor comedy. Given the talent involved, the results are rather disappointing. I get the feeling much of the narrative was improvised as they went along-- the storyline stumbling around in choppy fashion between golf course antics, nude sex, and O'Keefe's effort at raising college money. It's almost like a series of skits minus coherent connecting threads to build on. Nonetheless, there are some generally amusing elements-- the mischievous gopher, with his impish little face and clever effects. I'm just sorry he wasn't given more pranks since the comedic possibilities are a bucket-load. Instead, we get Ted Knight mugging it up in Ted Baxter style, along with a curled-lip Bill Murray doing something or other. Otherwise, it's a boisterous Rodney Dangerfield injecting real energy, while Chevy Chase plays his mystical club member in fairly straight style.All in all, I expected better given the splash the movie made on first release. Perhaps a sequel with a different director and writers could better tap the rich potential that's clearly there. That is, if our naughty gopher is still in residence.",Null,0,0,9 September 2019
Quiz Show," The Movie in a Little Historical Context
","Wow, I sat glued to the screen for two hours without a break. That doesn't happen often, but the movie was that good, even with a one-note plot, and no action or romance. Yes, it did bring back 60-year old memories, sometimes fond, sometimes not. First a few words on historical context.In the summer of 1955, Revlon cosmetics experimented with a big money quiz show, not sure how it would work in prime network time. It was called the $64,000 Question. Up to that point, quiz shows, whether radio or new-fangled TV, offered only small amounts of prize money. So this was an unimaginable amount to offer. Not surprisingly, the show was an immediate hit, earning a permanent place on the CBS network. Viewers were clearly enthralled, especially when a delicate little Dr. Joyce Brothers showed off her expert knowledge of Boxing, of all things. Thus, it was possible for contestants to win not only big money, but become minor celebrities in the process, that is, if they caught the public's fancy.Of course, network programming being a commercial enterprise, imitators soon followed, the most successful (I think) being Twenty-One. Unlike $64,000, it had the distinction of two contestants competing against one another from inside the famous isolation booths. There viewers could watch them sweat as they pondered their answers. The format was also a come-on since most everyone had played the simple card game of being the first to reach 21 in point count. I think this format had the most built-in drama of any other TV quiz show, which by 1956, were at least several.The movie, of course, exposes the biggest scandal in quiz show history, which occurred in 1956-57 on Twenty-One. I was in high school at the time and never missed these shows. I think it's fair to say that practically all viewers believed the shows were honest—I know my family did. And that's even when quiz-whiz Herb Stemple missed probably the easiest question asked him, namely, who won Best Picture Oscar from just 2-years earlier. We all shouted 'Marty' at the screen while he appeared terminally stumped, and we felt suddenly superior to this know-it-all. Likely, more discerning viewers suspected something fishy from that point on. But remember, this was the 1950's when, coming off a triumphal big war, most everyone still believed unquestioningly in authority. My friends and family certainly did. So when the rigged nature of Twenty-One was exposed in 1959, the public was generally shocked, especially as fair-haired boy Charles Van Doren was implicated. In fact, the big money quiz format was so discredited, it didn't revive for many decades.The movie itself amounts to a narrative triumph. Skillfully scripted, acted, and produced. The contrast between the nerdy-looking Stemple and the aristocratic Van Doren is striking. So, in retrospect, it's not surprising that producers Barry and Enright would see real ratings potential in a good-looking guy with a well-known family name. Fiennes's smirking Van Doren comes across as a rather slimy character once he's been compromised. Still, that scene of him amid the outdoor intellectual gathering is one a commoner like me can only imagine. As a result, I can understand how he could be seduced into establishing a reputation separate from his illustrious father (Scofield). Then there's the blue-collar Stemple harrumphing around his cold-water flat, having trusted the producers to come through for him after he took the humiliating dive. At times he's almost a comedic figure in his thrashing about.I guess my only reservation is with Morrow's casting as the bulldog investigator Jim Goodwin. To me, he doesn't project the kind of force necessary for untangling the shenanigans or tangling with stone walling network bigshots. But then, maybe he's intended to be a Peter Falk type Columbo with his disheveled appearance and mild manner. Be that as it may, the network honcho's are well cast and appropriately slippery as they seduce Stemple and Van Doren with prize money and promises of network jobs. Viewers can almost see their numbers-crunching brains in action. Tellingly, no woman is featured in the two hour runtime; and as an odd moment of curiosity, there's no indication whether Van Doren's successor Vivian Nearing was fed her answers or not.Anyway, the movie's fascinating in what it shows about the corruptive potency of TV ratings and commercial sponsors, a risky marriage that nevertheless endures. Thanks Robert Redford for reviving this sorry episode for generations later than mine.",Null,2,2,9 February 2015

Director Allen keeps things moving like a NASCAR rally. Oh, but there's the utterly charming Annie (Keaton). Her ditzy manner is so captivating, I couldn't take my eyes off that perpetual smile. But what's she got to smile about. Alvy sees only life's downsides even if in amusing fashion. The goof ball doesn't realize what a gem he's got, so wrapped up is he in his own curdled world.Allen blends talking to the camera, cartoon inserts, thought captions, and flashbacks in seamless fashion. You never know what's coming next, except it'll be funny. I had my doubts when I turned on the movie, like maybe Allen's been over-praised. But I have to admit, it's a one-of-a-kind that takes a lot of risks, but scores big-time.",Null,1,2,5 February 2017
The Graduate," Half of a Good Movie
","After 500+ reviews, what's left to say. Not much. The 60's protest against unthinking conformity has pretty well worn off. After all, today's college graduate would just like to have a job, any kind of job. Besides Benjamin may feel trapped, but if so, it's inside a darn cushy prison—note, he never seems to lack for money to do whatever he wants. His problem may have resonated with many college kids and some 60's radicals (they're not identical), but for a much better insight into 60's radicalism check out the now seldom seen Medium Cool (1969).As a movie, the first half is really funny. Benjamin's so civilized and awkward while Mrs. Robinson is so assured and aggressive. Their scenes wouldn't be half so effective had a Redford or some other good-looking guy been cast. Hoffman's just perfect, both physically and attitudinally with his low-key confusion. Too bad, the movie comes apart once Benjamin starts chasing Elaine. It's not funny anymore, nor does his sudden drive make a lot of sense. Shrewdly, there're the sounds of Simon and Garfunkel to take up the slack. A lot of kids thought the ending was a happy one back then. But take a look at how the eloping pair stare vacantly ahead in the final shots. It's like they're suddenly wondering what they've gotten themselves into and what do they do now. There's not even a sign in those vacant stares of the bonding to bridge into the future. No, it's an ambiguous final note despite the triumphal defiance of tradition.All in all, the movie is still worth seeing, mainly for its two wryly comedic and outstanding performances.",Null,0,1,18 March 2013

So what we get instead are special moments awkwardly combined. It's not surprising Tarantino would go on to an iconic career once the budget squeeze was off. However, I do wish he could have worked in some eye-catching females for relief from all the ugly guys. Surely that wouldn't have cost much. Nonetheless, I'm sure old time movie buffs like me are delighted to catch authentic tough guy Tierney as the gang leader.

Some Like It Hot," Cutting Edge, 1959
","No need to recap the plot nor echo consensus points.The movie is perfectly cast. The chemistry between Lemmon and Curtis is perfect. Add a wide-eyed Monroe and it's an outstanding comedy trifecta. Still, seeing the film again after first release, I wonder how much hilarity audiences of today find in the movie's sexual innuendo. After all, the premise was cutting-edge in 1959 when the word 'panties' in Anatomy of a Murder raised a ruckus with enforcers of the film code.In that same year, just watching from a theatre seat during the cross-dressing, plus the many innuendo scenes was like being a daring part of taboo-breaking. The bawdy subtext was a totally new experience in the commercial movies. Thus the amusement factor was heightened by novel comedic material, previously forbidden. But I wonder about today's younger audiences for whom the innuendo may even seem a little tame, given today's almost non-existent standards.In my little book, it's still a funny movie, thanks mainly to an expert cast, but hardly an all- time topper as it is in some ratings lists.

Psycho," A Key Scene in Depth
","In sixty years of movie watching there's one extended scene in Psycho that I count as being of unsurpassed brilliance. That's the about 7-minute scene in Norman's parlor where Marion has a bite of dinner shortly after arriving at the motel. To get an idea of its impact and significance, the setting is important. The parlor is dimly lit, casting shadows appropriate to the Gothic plot. Norman sits on one side, a stuffed raptor on the adjacent wall. It's shrewdly placed since the menacing wing-spread can background Norman when Hitch so chooses. Marion sits on the opposite side in a more conventionally lit setting, bespeaking her more conventional nature. Significantly, Hitch cross-cuts between them the entire time, never showing them in the same frame, thus emphasizing Norman's uniqueness and dominating part of the conversation.Now Norman is clearly unsure how to talk to the attractive woman alone with him in this, a private room. So he launches into a safe topic for him, but completely inappropriate to the light meal Marion is eating, namely his hobby, taxidermy. That is, how he likes to stuff birds but not the gore that comes with beasts. This tells us the important point that Norman is inexperienced socially, an aspect that fits in as the various parts of his nature come together over the movie's time-line. Throughout the tete-a-tete, Marion maintains a cautious but polite reserve as Hitch crosscuts between them. Her role here is mainly to draw the boyish stranger out. From taxidermy the dialog takes a more intimate turn. What emerges from the next topic, namely how to fill one's time, is that Norman is uncomfortable with his life with Mom. At the same time, however, he tries to casually laugh it off, one of his main defense mechanisms. Marion suggests that perhaps he should leave, that is, go away. But Norman senses something. He may be confused about a lot of things, but he's intuitive when he interjects that Marion must be running away from something, as indeed she is. At this point the conversation takes on a momentum that is revealing more and more about Norman's inner life. That's apparent when he starts talking ominously about private traps from which no one can escape—how we 'scratch and claw' (like a bird) but never to any avail. To Marion, this is a challenge to escape the embezzlement trap she's gotten herself into. To Norman, it's a disclosure of how he views his own life, and an excuse for not doing anything about it as though in his madness he could. At this point, Marion senses Norman's problem lies with his mother and suggests that he get away from the motel and from her. Once the topic turns to Mother, Hitch frames Norman in the foreground with the ominous stuffed bird (Mother) looming over him. Now we know Norman is indeed trapped and that Marion is venturing into dangerous territory. She accelerates the danger by suggesting that he should put Mom away, like 'in an institution or something'. This triggers a sudden, hostile response as Norman associates strangers and unfamiliar surroundings with thoughts of death, as indeed it would be for him. But true to his defense mechanisms, he does an abrupt 180 and laughs off the suggestion with the supreme irony that whatever her problems, at least Mom's 'harmless'. Then in another note of supreme irony, he trivializes her problem by saying that anyway we all go 'a little mad sometimes'. This of course would include Marion by inference, who now has a sense of her own embezzlement predicament and breaks off the conversation by resolving to return to Phoenix and face the music. At the same time, Norman reverts to his usual affable façade. And the scene ends. But unbeknownst to Marion, she may have resolved one trap, but has now entered a far more deadly one.This is the central scene of the film. It's not the most dramatic, but it is the one where we gain important insight into Norman's mental processes. Now as good as the writing and direction are, it's really Tony Perkins's exquisite performance that makes the seven minutes absolutely spellbinding. Watch how quickly and persuasively he changes expression and mood. Because of his expertise, we know that something's seriously wrong with Norman, but can't be sure exactly what, while it takes the rest of the movie to find out. One moment, he's all boyish charm, the next he's glaring darkly with inner fire. Of course, Janet Leigh's superb performance as Marion should not be overlooked. In this key scene, her task is to politely draw out Norman's feelings, an essentially secondary role, but demanding in its own way. Note how delicately she balances her bites of food with proper emotional composure as this strange man reveals more of himself to her. Without doubt, this was an actress with more than just a pretty face.To me, Perkins' eccentric performance is clearly Oscar worthy, ditto the picture itself, along with Hitch's masterful direction. But industry prejudices against horror movies was just too strong then and perhaps now. Of course, it didn't help for Oscar purposes that the production was also low-budget b&w. But I doubt the audience impact would have been nearly as great had that unforgettable package been upscaled in any fashion. At the same time, a big part of the classic flick, in my book, at least, rests with that 7-minutes of emerging horror, so brilliantly understated.",Null,3,4,2 September 2013
Rosemary's Baby," Brilliantly Constructed
","Just a few remarks on seeing the movie again years after its initial release. What a cleverly constructed screenplay (Polanski). We never know more than central character Rosemary (Farrow). That way her gradual realization becomes ours too. Of course, we know in advance from the film's reputation that an infernal plot is underway to envelop her, but still the narrative captivates. Who exactly is involved in the plot remains unclear, along with the details. Tip-offs gradually emerge as when old Minnie (Gordon) insists on the hellish concoction that Rosemary must drink. But then Gordon plays Minnie in such a goofy gadfly manner, it's hard to think of her as a witch. All in all, it's that clever narrative construction combining our awareness with Rosemary's that's the crux of a fascinating film. And given the lengthy two-hour-plus runtime, that's no mean fete. Then too, shouldn't overlook Farrow's career topping performance as the besieged victim. In fact, it's hard for me to think of anyone else as the waifish mother-to-be. Anyway, it's a brilliant horror film in spite of spilling scarcely a drop of blood. Contemporary filmmakers could take note.",Null,1,3,22 January 2017
All Quiet on the Western Front," Worth a Closer Look
","Few movies have used mud so tellingly. The schoolboys dream of joining the noisy glory that marches by their classroom window. So, egged on by their teacher and a wave of patriotic enthusiasm, the German boys sign up. But what do they get instead of military glory--- miles and miles of foot slogging mud as the company marches to the WWI battlefront. And that's after they've crawled face down through training fields of the slimy stuff, looking more like human worms than soldiers. Worse, when they get to the war front, what do they get but more slimy dirt in the trenches that make up their new home. It's all living, eating, and dying in the same wet ground. And when they get killed, as they almost surely will, what will their flesh and bones do but make more mud for new waves of mud-makers to slog through. No wonder the movie is considered an anti-war masterpiece-- military glory itself is reduced to the earth's most elemental stuff.I've often wondered how American audiences would respond if the boys were American instead of German, given the movie's militantly anti-war message. But however that may be, the 2-hours-plus never drags as we watch the boys encounter the various horrors—and the mischief, too—of life at the front.No wonder one kid freaks out when the coffin-like closeness and constant shelling of the trenches finally gets to him. My understanding is that once the battle lines of WWI settled in, the front never moved more than 75-miles in four-years. No wonder the fabled poppy fields of Flanders grew so abundantly afterwards. And if the horrors of the trenches aren't bad enough, there's the 'dying room' in the hospital where the hopeless cases are taken. There they can expire alone and out of sight. I can imagine how other wounded boys dangled on the precipice of being moved there or anywhere. It's that constant dread amidst the tidy surroundings and caring hands, and far from the battlefield, that's stayed with me over the years.Lewis Milestone's staging of scenes along the front remains a technical marvel. What a triumph of fluid camera work is that panorama of troops attacking across the no-man's-land, only to be mowed down by defenders and their hell-fire machine guns. I gather throwing men at waves of bullets was the basic brutal strategy of both sides. Small wonder then, that the war was also called the great European slaughter bench, and small wonder that a lot of generals on both sides should have been court- martialed, as a result. Fortunately, Milestone's inspired staging makes these larger dimensions understandable.At the same time, it's an inspiration to personalize the impersonal dimension of battle. In a shell hole in the middle of no-man's- land, Paul (Ayers) encounters the face of a dying Frenchman, only to realize that the enemy is a man pretty much the same as Paul. That central scene puts a critical human face on the act of killing, transforming combat for Paul and us into an excruciating personal close-up. For without that intimate encounter, the battle scenes would be reduced to an abstraction of colliding gray figures.The narrative does have its lighter moments as when three of the boys encounter three French girls, and nature takes its course, helped along, of course, by treasured loaves of bread. In the process, we realize that hunger and lust have a way of cutting through minor matters like who's French or German or anything else. Note too how fairly explicit the innuendo is during this early pre-Code period. There's also that black humor scene of the shells blowing up the graveyard as though dying once just isn't enough in wartime.Then, of course, there's Louis Wolheim as Kat who steals the film with his gruff humor and unforgettable mug. The final scenes between Paul and him manage a poignancy rare in any film. In fact, as Paul says, Kat has become his 'family' now that soldiering has consumed them both. Too bad that the boy's horrific experiences have likely separated him forever from mother, sister, and hometown. To me, this is one of the more subtly unsettling aspects of the movie's anti-war message.Ayers hasn't as much depth as I would like, but he does have that critical air of innocence that magnifies the story's tragedy. It's his mere presence, rather than 'acting', that gets the point across, which is pretty much the case for all the young actors. At the same time, it's hard to forget their one-by-one glances at us as they march off into the anonymous pages of history. In fact, the war has done this to thousands like Paul and his comrades, and all the patriotic hype of their elders cannot bring them back or heal the psychic wounds of those who survive. Thanks be to Universal studios and director Milestone for sparing no expense in bringing Remarque's epochal novel to the popular screen. For what they left us with is a truly remarkable film.",Null,3,3,27 November 2011
Paths of Glory," Casting a Long Shadow
","How well I remember the audience of 1958 sitting in stunned silence as the daring iconoclasm of the film washed over us like a bucket of cold water at a snoozer's convention. Post-war generations had seen nothing like its brutal honesty before. Instead, Hollywood had taught us that soldiers don't bawl like babies before being shot, that chaplains aren't part of a murderous war machine, that military justice really is about justice, and that generals however far removed are ultimately good and honorable men, (and that cameras always look away from execution scenes). Sure, the movie was not about our army, but the power of its message could not be missed, and no one from that era, having seen it, could again accept Hollywood's platitudes at face value. Now, fifty years later, the film is still timely, having lost none of its power to illuminate. Thanks be to Kirk Douglas for taking a chance on an unproven Stanley Kubrick and getting Allied Artists to finance what was so clearly a non-commercial project. I suspect too, that it was at AA's insistence that Hollywood veterans be cast, even though the movie was shot to great advantage amidst the majestic settings of old Europe. Given the film's message, I think Kubrick would have preferred no-name principals, but then, who could have surpassed the oily charm of Adolphe Menjou's diabolical general, or the pathetic repulsiveness of Timothy Carey's sacrificial dog-face. (It's ironic that the part of the cowardly lieutenant went to an authentic war-hero, naval air-ace Wayne Morris, then only two years away from an untimely death.) This many decades later, I still have mixed feelings about the celebrated final scene. On one hand, it's so clearly manipulative (someone once called it a 'male weepie'), that I try to steel myself against its undeniable force; on the other, it's so superbly well done that the humming chorus of universal brotherhood never fails to move me, even after this many viewings. Researchers digging into origins of 60's counter-culture should check out themes and characterizations of the screen-play, particularly Timothy Carey's social outcast and Fred Bell's absolutely stunning thirty seconds of emotional break-down. For this is one of the few films from the conformist Eisenhower era to cast a shadow forward in time and serve as a reference point for future generations. The film's abundant cynicism may no longer be as revealing as it once was, thanks to Vietnam. Yet the emotional honesty remains as fresh and compelling as ever in its search for a gut-level depiction of real human anguish. Above all, Kubrick's anti-war classic points toward a more civilized potential amidst the barbarities and passions of combat, whether French or American, and given present political realities, still has many lessons to offer.",Null,1,3,24 May 2008
Carrie," Just How Sweet is Revenge
","Above all, this is a revenge movie. In fact, revenge movies have long been a staple of masculine entertainment. Charles Bronson, for example, made a lucrative career out of macho revenge where the culprits get blown away with big time splatters. However, this is a revenge movie of a different stripe, one that appeals to a great number of us who look back on high school as a kind of horror film in its own right. If the subtext weren't so poignant, Carrie would amount to just another splatter film. But it's that powerful subtext of the victim contracting special powers to avenge humiliation that taps into the hidden daydream of so many, young or old.In the movie, Carrie not only suffers at school, but home offers no refuge either. Mom's idea of sex-ed or life of any kind is to read the Bible and pray. No wonder the mousy Carrie hugs the walls hoping no one notices or worse, follows her home. The movie thus taps into the powerful emotions of an innocent kid trapped by circumstance with no apparent way out—an emotion, I expect, we've all felt at some time or another. Of course, Carrie does get a way out, but one that only happens in storybooks. Her misfortune is that this is a Stephen King storybook.Of course, Carrie's enraged bloodletting doesn't distinguish between the innocent and the guilty, so in that sense, she turns into a monster of a special sort. Wisely, the film makes that daring move from Cinderella-on-the-stage to murderous-monster-on-a-rampage, such that our initial delight in her ability to strike back must confront the indiscriminate slaughter her preternatural ability brings about. Thus, once the mayhem starts, the audience is plunged into a world of mixed feelings, without time to sort things out. Making the malicious Norma suffer seems poetically just, but what about the compassionate Miss Collins, apparently cut in half by a swinging bench! Thus, the casual cruelty of the locker room turns abruptly into the Prom Night from Hell, and we get a perplexing morality tale to think about.DePalma films all this stylishly, but with all the subtlety of a hammer blow to the head. Apparently, he belongs to the school that believes that if a little of something is good, then a lot more must be a lot better. Fortunately for both him and us, the material lends itself to his particular brand of visual excess. Carrie may not manage the artistic level of Val Lewton-type horror (I Walked with a Zombie {1943} or Seventh Victim {1943}), but it does, I think, tap into some of our deeper, hidden feelings. And that I believe is one secret of the movie's success.",Null,1,2,13 August 2009
The Iron Giant," Even a Geezer Likes It
","After so many responses, there's not much left to say. Except that as a geezer who lived through the 1950's, I enjoyed seeing a send-up of the paranoia of the time. If it wasn't commies menacing us, it was aliens in Roswell, NM. Plus, it may seem like a joke now, but Duck and Cover didn't when annihilation could come any moment from The Bomb. Ordinarily I wouldn't watch an animated feature since I grew up thinking that meant cartoon. However, this edition was recommended, and I ended up thoroughly enjoying it. Strange how unreal characters quickly become real. Anyway, this film reminded me of a classic in my day called The Day The Earth Stood Still (1951). Except the gentlemanly Klaatu and the laser-eyed robot Gort, the two main alien visitors of Stood Still, are combined here into the single character of the Iron Giant. However, in both movies, the adversity to be overcome is a paranoid American defense establishment. That was a pretty darn touchy topic for a Cold War 1951. The moral here seems something like getting over our cultural hostility to The Other, whatever form that might take. Here, of course, it's a giant metal robot, whose goodness turns out to embody something eternal, as its parts survive destruction. All in all, the animated story amounts to a happy surprise and a compelling one even for a geezer like me.",Null,0,0,24 June 2015
Blade Runner," Mind-bending, but Needs Better Balance
","Superb sci-fi. Yet its strengths are ironically also its weaknesses. The visuals dramatically underscore the dystopian future of LA. They're deep, dark, and unrelenting. Unfortunately, they're also spread on too thickly and widely, such that their noirish presence overshadows the plot's subtle themes. Those themes, as others abundantly point out, have to do with what it means to be human. The fact that the replicants, Roy and Rachael, begin to seem as human as Deckard by movie's end is a neat philosophical twist. Trouble is these key themes are easily overshadowed by the overwhelming visuals. Thus, many well-meaning viewers get bored by what appears an absence of storyline. Too bad that a better balance between story and visuals fails to develop. Nonetheless, there's much to recommend, as others detail, in this probing slice of sci-fi.(In passing—It's no accident I think that the Bradbury building in downtown LA appears throughout the 2-hours. Famous for its use in such classic noirs as DOA {1950} and M {1951}, its use here may well be a homage from futuristic noir to the classic past.)",Null,0,1,31 December 2016
Speed," If You Like Cartoons
","After the first 30 minutes of non-stop action and hair-raising close calls with little or no dialog-- about the time the super-charged bus made a death-defyimg leap across a freeway chasm-- I figured there had to be a pause coming up. You know the old-fashioned type movie-making when the audience gets a chance to catch its breath and anticipate the action to come. Maybe even a few minutes of human interest. But that pause never came. Then after the second 30 minutes of non-stop action and hair-raising close calls-- about the time the bus blows up the airplane real good-- I figured the pause had to come. But no, it never did. Instead, there was another 30 minutes of non-stop action and hair-raising close calls, and about the time the subway began to get a mind of its own, something really strange happened. I realized I had gotten bored. Now you wouldn't think that with all that non-stop action and hair-raising close calls, a viewer could actually get bored. But I was. Something, I think, about too much of one thing becoming first familiar, then old, and finally tedious. Then when the non-stop action and hair-raising close calls finally did come to a stop, as all things must, I had my final revelation. What I had just sat through only looked like a real life movie. But it wasn't. Not really. Instead it was only a cartoon version of non-stop action and hair-raising close-calls with human versions of those familiar characters the Roadrunner and Wylie Coyote. Unfortunately, the money I spent was not cartoon money.",Null,4,9,5 May 2008
The Producers," A Possible Moral to the Madcap
","After 200+ reviews, what's left to say. Nothing much, except such an outrageous comedy could only have emerged from the free-wheeling 60's. Actually, what surprises me is the relative absence of sex, unless romance with giggly 80-year olds qualifies. But then neither Mostel nor Wilder is exactly an answer to a maiden's dream.What a marvelous premise the writers came up with. Producing a guaranteed flop just about makes all the subsequent insanity believable. And getting drug-addled 'LSD' (Shawn) to play Hitler makes for perfect nonsense. No doubt about it, the movie's a one-of-a-kind, outrageously funny from beginning to end and arguably Brook's best. But I shouldn't forget the moral, which appears to be submerged in all the crazy antics. Namely, sometimes celebrating life means breaking the mold and taking goofy chances as the 'liberated' Leo Bloom (Wilder) demonstrates in the very last shot.",Null,0,1,21 December 2013
Saboteur," Gearing Up for the Big One
","No need to recap the plot nor echo consensus points.The movie reminds me a lot of North By Northwest (1959), right down to the cliff-hanger ending. Except this chase drama was made early in WWII, which means the dialogue is salted with understandably patriotic preachments. After all, it's going to take a committed country to win the war, and in 1942, things weren't going well in either Asia or Europe. Note how Barry (Cummings), a stranger in most instances, is trustingly supported by the common man types. This underscores the popular effort that will be needed to win the war. Then too, there's a reference to Brooklyn, often heard during this period, since the New York borough was shorthand for America's melting pot. Note also, the beautifully staged ballroom sequence populated by upper-class types. Here's where the treacherous, aristocrat Tobin (Kruger) hangs out, reinforcing by contrast the common man as the loyal backbone of the nation.This thread remains a key theme of the film, but unfortunately, it also dates the events in ways that North By Northwest, for example, does not. Nonetheless, Saboteur's expertly staged narrative can be enjoyed on its own, and for its many tension-filled moments. Can't help also noting how apt Robert Cummings is for his role. He brings a freshness and unexpected grit to the part that seems just right for an idealized version of an 'everyman' rising to the occasion when called upon.The movie may not be front-rank Hitchcock, but it does remain a masterful example of staging and picaresque story-telling.",Null,1,2,13 September 2013
Born on the Fourth of July," A Slightly Different Approach
","Take a look at the typical war pictures from the 1950's and early 60's. When they're not comedies that make the logistics side look like fun (Mister Roberts, Operation Petticoat, et al.), they're making WWII look like nothing but a virtuous march to victory (Battle Cry, The Longest Day, et al.). Or take a look at the carefully edited TV documentaries that influenced a generation (Victory at Sea, Crusade in Europe, et al.), or the innocuous, de-politicized TV series of the time (Ozzie and Harriet, The Ed Sullivan Show et al.). Or consider how quickly that 'forgotten war' in Korea really was forgotten. In brief, the Cold War culture of those 15 years created a Ron Kovic generation that had no reference point beyond a sanitized framework filled only with uncritical images of America and its past. How surprising is it, then, that thousands of us of that generation learned our politics the hard way.The movie shows in painful detail the price Kovic paid for his eager willingness to believe. It's a harrowing story, to say the least. But then, how prepared were any of those teen-age grunts to understand that Vietnam was not WWII. How prepared were they to understand the anti-occupation struggle of the Vietnamese was one they had been fighting for decades. There was nothing in American popular culture to prepare them for those realities. For to do so would have required questioning whether we were really the biggest and the best, or whether those terms should even apply. That's why Kovic must break with the past in order to regain a semblance of mental health. It even requires breaking with a mother and father too innocent to understand. Perhaps they can reconcile later on. In the meantime, Kovic and those around him will have to accept that he is now a different man who no longer 'fits in' the way he did.It's a wrenching and well-done film, showing how wars of empire are really fought. But more importantly, it's a beneficial warning to those who would go thousands of miles away to a strange land to fight a politician's war. Thankfully, that message is a long welcome way from the war movies of my youth.",Null,0,0,25 January 2009
Goodfellas," Just a Bunch of Neighborhood Guys
","If The Godfather (1972) is grand opera, Goodfellas is Grand Guignol. The violence is sudden and brutal, with no effort at cosmetics. This is a blue-collar crime ring Hill (Liotta) belongs to, with connections to the Mafia. They've got just enough juice to act with impunity. Shoot a kid waiter— don't worry about the law; after all, that's what the payoffs are for. Want to impress your girl with a table up front at the Copa— don't worry they'll make one. These are criminal entrepreneurs, looking to make a buck anywhere, except dealing dope (too risky, I guess), that is, until Hill fatefully succumbs. It's an exciting life, as long as you stay on the right side of the unwritten rules. So, even the underworld operates by a standard of justice, namely their own. As to the rest of the world—that's made up of 9 to 5 schnooks.Liotta turns in a fine controlled performance in the central role of Henry Hill. Ditto, DeNiro as the dangerous Jimmy. But, Pesci is all out psychotic as Tommy. It's hard to see how the gang could put up with a nutty loose cannon like him even if he does furnish the movie with its edgy appeal. Scorcese directs with down-home gusto, focusing almost as much on family life as the criminal. Still, the 160-minute result could easily have been trimmed back. That would have tightened the impact. Nonetheless, the movie is a fascinating look at urban crime, proletarian style.",Null,0,1,13 January 2014
The Wizard of Oz," A Late-Comer
","I was born the same year the movie came out, but only caught up with it the other night, mainly because musicals are not my usual movie fare. So what's left to say after 500+ reviews. I was most impressed by the art and set direction. Too bad they didn't win Oscars. The sets were so imaginative and well done, from poppy fields to enchanted woods to yellow brick road. For once, MGM's habit of over-producing what's on screen really paid off with an appropriately lavish scale. The effects are simply breathtaking, but I can also detect the nightmarish visuals that go beyond the demonic Witch of the West. So I can see why kids would be both mesmerized and unsettled by the fantastic adventures.I also have to say that Garland was wonderful as Dorothy, though I've never been a particular fan. Plus, her captivating rendition of Rainbow deserves to top the all-time movie charts. All in all, I'm sorry it took me so long to catch up. It's really hard to believe that so many cooks (writers & directors) didn't spoil the outcome. Somehow, the sumptuous production with its sturdy moral all came together, and remains aptly a movie for the ages.",Null,4,5,17 November 2013
