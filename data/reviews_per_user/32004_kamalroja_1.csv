Million Dollar Arm," This musical biography has million arms for embracing the sense of hearing.
",Once again a great musician with Australian film-maker from India done an Indo-Hollywood script. Its simple and pleasing to the senses. Its the story of converting an Indian amateur thrower into a base ball player in U.S.JON HAMM and some few others have decent screen presence. The changeover from India TO US seems beautiful. Very close to life not mostly the story of Hollywood. There is no single match is played in the screen. But still we can feel the importance of any sport other than cricket which is hyped much in India. Mostly the movie is funny humorous and rarely has some bits of good writing which is emotional.In response to a question 'which god will you pray'' the protagonists says that ''I don't pray. But I do work''. Yet another impressing scene is an Indian coach given a chance not just to laugh but to encourage the players whom selected for. Its inspiring.Above all the 'thirakkatha kattukkulle(திறக்காத காட்டுக்குள்ளே)' a tamil song runs when the screen fall was amazing to feel.Finally I would like to say just go if you like a movie with simple real stories. The music just take care of the rest.,Null,4,8,10 May 2014
