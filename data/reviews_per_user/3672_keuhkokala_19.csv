Mission: Impossible III," Does the same for the franchise as Batman Begins did for Batman
","I got to see in advance the first big blockbuster of the summer in a press screening. I must say that the summer begins quite nicely. M:I:III does the same for the franchise as Batman Begins did for Batman. Both had to follow one of the worst sequels of all time. However to put a newly found rising talent as director and take a darker grip on the story both do wonders.The plot, that was long held secret is as follows: Special Agent Ethan Hunt has left field operations to get married to beautiful doctor named Julia. However, when Hunt's friend and former student gets caught during a mission, Hunt must return. And then something goes terribly wrong etc. Sound like a standard action-movie so far, doesn't it? But the real surprises are yet to come. J.J. Abrams (Alias and Lost) has directed a film that works as well as his previous work. Feels the same, too. The story twists don't get too big as in the first movie, though.As for the acting, Tom Cruise isn't the least bit irritating in this one. I got to hand it to the bastard, he sure can pick up the best projects from the best directors. Hunt's team mates are now present throughout the movie, so the movie centrals around an agent team more rather than just Cruise's super agent. Simon Pegg is fun as the Q-like gadget-expert. One would have liked to see more of him. Or at least little better scripted appearances. The best of them all is however Philip Seymour Hoffman as the villain. His weapons dealer is cool as ice, ruthless and totally merciless. The new Bond-movies badly need such baddies, but you haven't seen them since Blofeld was dropped in a chimney.The bast thing about this movie is that it's exciting. A couple of scenes in the beginning really make you believe that these characters are in mortal peril. You relate to the characters just enough to care what will happen to them. Even Ethan Hunt is a human being this time around. The Bond movies have never had that kind of thing, except maybe On her majesty's secret service or From Russia with love. The action is, of course great and the familiar M:i-clichés, such as self-destructing tapes, real-like rubber masks and jumps on a wire, appear.All in all, a very satisfying action movie and a positive surprise.****The Best Part (Spoiler):The opening scene, where Hoffman questions Cruise about an object with a gun on his loved one's head.",8,11,24,1 May 2006
Raiders of the Lost Ark," I wanted a hat like that as a kid
","(May include SPOILERS)This was one of my favorite films as a child, along with Jason and the Argonauts, Jurassic Park, Critters, the Lion King and the Naked Gun. The first adventure of Indy is like one of the great Donald Duck comics of Carl Barks came to life. It's as funny, exciting and has a wonderful treasure as a McGuffin (the thing everyone in the film wants). Except, of course it's more violent. But as I am a twisted kind of person who enjoys violent films and black humour, I can't say that is anything else, but a recommendation. But if you don't want to see a hulking German mechanic being chopped by an aeroplane propeller, see something else.Actually, when you think of it, the plot has been seen millions of times before and after (man gets a mission, meets a girl, girl hates him, fights some sherpas and Nazis and arabs and the wrath of God and gets the girl in the end), the characters are as thin as paper and the ending is quite dull (funny though). But who can say no to a movie, that has Nazis, ghosts, lots of snakes, a hero, who never drops his hat and a monkey who can give a nazi salute. Fans of new blockbusters might want to check, if they can spot the actors of Doc Ock and Gimli (no challenge to real movie fans, but they must have seen this already)There's everything anyone could ask for in this movie, even a very romantic scene, when Marion fixes Indy's wounds up! Well, anything except serious drama and nudity, but there are other films for those. There's almost nothing bad in this movie and that makes this my top ten movies of all time #10!***** (10/10)Best part: Of course it HAS to be the iconic running away from a giant ball of stone that has inspired video game programmers, artists and movie directors alike.No, it MUST be when Toth's face melts at the end. That was was the creepiest thing I ever saw as a kid (well, next to the documentary about Ötzi the mummy)No it IS the 'swordfight' against the arab. That's the funniest joke in any action movie, EVER!",9,0,0,23 September 2004
Ed Wood," 'Bela has risen from the grave!'
","1994 was arguably the best movie year for 20 years. The year had movies like The Shawshank Redemption, Pulp Fiction, the Lion King, Clerks, Heavenly Creatures and even a good Elm Street sequel! Many were then outraged, when their favorites were ignored in the Oscars when Forrest Gump (a good, but not great movie) cleared the table. Many argue that Shawshank should've won best picture and Pulp should've won the best actor awards. But, to my opinion, a more worthy winner to these awards would've been this gem, Tim Burton's masterpiece.Burton has always had his own vision that no one else can't have messed with. This movie too is about outsiders, freaks even, who can't adjust to the surrounding world. It's almost tragic that many things described here actually happened. A lesser director would've made a Bowfinger-like comedy that has cheap laughs for the bad talent of the director, but Burton still holds the strings. While the movie has plenty of humor, it is never mean to it's characters and never points fingers and laughs at them, but rather with them.The movie's best qualities lie in the acting talent. I honestly think Martin Landau's Bela Lugosi is the best performance I have ever seen an actor do. He makes the horror icon seem so vulnerable, so painful and yet a wonderful actor, although given crappy material by Wood. For example, who understands what the hell the 'Pull the String!' scene means, but Bela's (and Landau's) talent covers it up. And kudos also to the make-up. If Wood would've had the make-up artists, maybe the Bela look-a-like in Plan 9 could've shown his face, too.All the other actors are wonderful, too. Johnny Depp proves once again that he is one of the greatest actors of his generation. The movie's positive tone is mostly thanks to him and his positive attitude and it's a small wonder that Wood couldn't sell his movies if he resembled anything like Depp in real life. Sarah Jessica Parker, Bill Murray, Lisa Marie, Jeffrey Jones... the movie is full of unforgettable performances! The movie's story is a success-story without the success. The movie is a testimony of how hard it can be to make even a cheap movie made in Hollywood. The movie is about overcoming these obstacles. In that it's like a tribute to the cinema itself. At the end the ever-optimistic Wood thinks he's made the movie he'll be remembered, Plan 9 from Outer Space. He's right, but not after he's gone. The optimistic end is contrasted by the following epilogues, that like in American Graffiti, prove that life doesn't always work the best way for every one. Burton still made the right decision to end the movie in the right point of Wood's life.***** (the top 10 movies I've seen #3)",9,0,0,29 July 2005
The Adventures of Tintin," Blistering Barnacles! The adventure film of the year!
","Having grown up with the Tintin comic books, I was doubtful of this project. I'm not a fan of the motion-capture technology and I feared the world created by Hergé would be sanitized for American audiences. But there was no need to worry. Tintin is a funny, exciting and tremendously entertaining adventure movie. It's also Spielberg's most entertaining film since Jurassic Park.Tintin (Jamie Bell) is a young reporter who gets tangled in the affairs of smugglers when he buys a model ship from a scrap meet. When he gets kidnapped to the smugglers' ship, he meets Captain Haddock (Andy Serkis). He's a pure-hearted old drunk, who has information on a great treasure, told as a legend in his family for generations. He just needs to get sober enough to remember it. The adventure takes the pair to the Atlantic, Sahara, Morocco and finally back home. Tintin lives in an unmentioned European city that could be Brussels, London or any other one that has a sea port, really.True to the comics, Tintin himself doesn't really have any strong characteristics. So it stands to reason that the minor characters steal the film again and again. Captain Haddock's alcoholism may not be suitable for the younger children, but it provides some of the film's most hilarious jokes. Almost as good are Nick Frost and Simon Pegg as bumbling Interpol detectives Thompson and Thomson. Familiar faces from the comics pop up now and then, but don't overcrowd the film. The focus is still on the main characters.Even the 3D isn't just a distraction, as Spielberg has truly gone off his way to make use for the technology. Action scenes are shot with a long single shot, where the camera goes around to wild angles. There's a strong sense of being in on the action and forgetting you even are wearing a pair of painful glasses. The film takes a while to pick off steam at first, but after that the action varies from pirate battles to crane fights. The most outstanding scene is the motorcycle chase near the end, which would give Indiana Jones a run for his money.The film's story is faithful to the comic book, and thus ends promising more. I hope there will be, because I was willing to follow Tintin and Haddock on new adventures straight away! I'd say it's among the best, the most innovative comic-book films with Sin City and Scott Pilgrim vs. The World. The film is excellent escapism from the dreary day-to-day life and it made me smile for the rest of the day.",Null,78,118,20 October 2011
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Wonderfully captures the spirit of the great book
","(This has some small SPOILERs)When I first heard they were going to do a film trilogy of one of my favorite books, I thought it would never work. It felt impossible to see the spirit of the book on film. How could so magnificent landscapes, characters, monsters and the feel of magic possibly be made to be even close to what it is in the book. And what has this Peter Jackson ever directed? I had never heard of him.And how wrong I was. Jackson is now, in fact my favorite director, though I´ve only seen four of his films (the two LOTRs, Braindead and Frighteners), but I can see he has a lot of talent, both in macabre horror-comedies and epic action-adventures. And I could´ve never thought New Zealand had such beatiful sceneries. It must be as close as you can get to Middle-Earth on this planet.Also, almost all the characters are as I pictured them. Ian McKellen is wonderful as Gandalf, John-Rhys Davies makes a nice scottish Gimli and Viggo Mortensen has easily the charisma of Aragorn. Only the hobbits bothered me a bit in the beginning. Eliah Wood isn´t excactly how I thought Frodo would be like and Dominic Monaghan´s Pippin irritated me a bit of his stupidiness and thick accent. But as the movie goes on, I, like any viewer, start to like more and more of the characters.The movie goes on much like the book, only in the later films Jackson has added some scenes here and there. Now the only addition is Aragorn and Arwen in Rivendell, which is a quite good idea, because the movie has some female beauty in the form of Liv Tyler (And Cate Blanchett later!) and the romance in the book is as dull as the movie´s concept artist´s pencil.This movie has a lot of great scenes and only one annoying; the cave troll sequence. I´ve read also other reviews who hated this part, but having a big monster looking behind a pillar where a character is hiding, first from the left, then from the right and then spotting the hider by looking right again is just stupid and would have fitted better on Jurassic Park III. But as the scene only takes about 1/90 of the film, there isn´t much to complain. I highly recommend, except if you think the idea of a land inhabited by elves, dwarves, wizards and orcs is the stupidest movie idea since the talking dragon in Dragonheart, don´t bother.10/10The best part (SPOILER): The battle between Gandalf and the Balrog in the bridge of Khazad-Dûm, which ends of Gandalf falling from the bridge and saying to others 'Flee, you fools!' is a modern-day response to the battle between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker in the Empire Strikes back",9,1,3,13 September 2003
The Matrix Revolutions," A better ending to the trilogy as I had thought
","I haven't read many favorable reviews about this movie. Many seem to think this is the worst movie of the trilogy. Well, I'll have to disagree. True, the movie has quite a lot of faults, and is far from the quality of the original Matrix, but it sure beats Reloaded.This movie is the best of the trilogy in some aspects. For starters, this one is most exciting. In the other two, the main characters were more or less invulnerable. Only in the Matrix when the traitor pulls of the plugs of the crew in Matrix, were you really concerned about whether the main characters would die. But when the machine army attacks Zion, the battle is hopeless, desperate and epic a bit like the battle of Helm's Deep in LOTR: the Two Towers, but only more like a video game. The movie's best thing is some good plot twists. Usually a big Hollywood pictures can't surprise you, but this one has some twists I bet you won't see coming.This one even has a plot, whereas Reloaded didn't. Sure, there's some plot holes and the movie doesn't explain every question the previous movies have made, but does it really have to? Nowadays people would like to see everything explained as clear as possible. This movie doesn't do that and has been teared apart. Hasn't it ever occurred to anyone that the questions should be thought about after seeing the movie. There's nothing like the experience of thinking about something in the movie that didn't make sense and suddenly getting it! I recommend you should give it a shot.On the worse side, like many have pointed out, the Wachowskis seem to have forgotten what was it that made the first movie so famous; the incredible world of the Matrix is almost completely forgotten. The shoot-out at Club Hell is a dull routine action-sequence, but the last battle with Agent Smith covers it. Because Reloaded and Revolutions are more or less the same picture, the Wachowskis could've divided the actions in the real world and in the Matrix between the two movies better. Also the long talks. And the plot. One could think, these sequels could've been a lot better if they had done it. Well, I guess it's too late to worry about that. The beautiful ending with the little girl, the Oracle and Architecht watching the sun rise at least leave a good taste out of these movies. They are both OK action movies, it's just that everyone waited for them to be as brilliant as the first Matrix. The curse of the sequels being inferior struck again.*** 1/2 (7/10)The Best part (SPOILER): Before the Super Brawl we are introduced to the King of the machines. I got a kick out of seeing that surrealist creature. It's like a giant, floating sea urchin with a baby's face made of tiny robots. With an attitude.",7,0,0,10 November 2003
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Young Hearts will Clash (at Demonhead)
","Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is a quite good movie, despite it having to balance kick-ass over-the-top action, dry observational character-based comedy and a sweet, life-like romance. But director Edgar Wright has proved himself to be able to direct with a fast, music video -like style, of pretty normal and mundane things. He is also able to make symphatetic comedy characters that are properly fleshed out.Scott Pilgrim is based on a comic-book by Bryan Lee O'Malley. The titular character is a slacker in his early twenties. He's just met a new girlfriend, the 17-year-old Knives (Ellen Wong). He introduces her to punk music with his band, Sex Bob-Omb. But as their relationship progresses Scott grows anxious as he's dreaming about a mysterious woman on roller skates, Ramona (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). When he finally meets her, he decides that she is the woman of his dreams and gives everything to be with her. But besides having to break up with his prior girlfriend, this means he has to battle seven bitter old flames of Ramona.The colorful imagery of the film is very comic book-like. Sound effects are displayed by text, split-screens resemble comic panels, the color scheme is bright and colorful etc. It owes also much to various video games (such as Street Fighter, Devil May Cry and Mortal Kombat) and to anime movies. It's worth noting that rather than copying O'Malley's style, Wright creates his own visual better suited for the film medium.The OTT style represents on how the characters feel their (love) own lives are earth-shatteringly important. Characters can do basically anything: fly, make sonic blasts with guitars or turn people into quarters.The editing is fast and furious. It is fitting that the soundtrack consists of fast and furious punk rock music as well. And it is very, very good, especially the songs by Beck.The biggest strength of the film is the large cast of characters, all of which are well-written and believable in that universe. Wright has chosen his supporting cast well, as even with few lines, they bring out the fun and steal scenes. Michael Cera and Mary Elizabeth Winstead are both good, but overshadowed by the supporting cast. However, their relationship works in the film too, and one can reflect one's own heartbreaks and loves on the screen. This is a feat only films that have characters one can truly identify with, can have.The film is aimed for an audience from teens to mid-twenties (more if they are really childish). Many people older from that probably won't understand anything from the kinetic style, or have forgotten what it feels like to have heartache at this age. For us that do, and geek out over the stuff this references, this is warmly recommended.Full review at http://fastmovieblog.blogspot.com/",8,4,36,9 August 2010
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," More great characters come to life!
","(This has some SPOILERs)They say this part was the most difficult to film, as it´s in the center of the trilogy. Well, it isn´t as good as the Fellowship of the Ring, but this part has still a lot of great stuff in it.First, there´s Gollum. You simply can´t write a review of this movie without writing about Gollum. He is my favorite character in the book, as he is a horrible monster and an old hobbit the ring has been torturing for 500 years at the same time. I always pitied him. Gollum has been made CG on this movie, though his motions and words come from actor Andy Serkins. On screen Gollum looks quite like how I pictured him, although his ears are too big and blue eyes do not suit him, especially as his eyes were green in the previous film. Serkins also provides great acting, especially when monster Gollum and his inner hobbit Smeágol argue. Kind of reminds me of the Green Goblin and Norman Osborne in Spider-Man.Another great new character is Treebeard the ent, who is also mostly computer-generated. John Rhys-Davies´s voice fits him, but it´s too bad the ents are on-screen very little. Well, it gets paid off in the end. Rhys-Davies also plays Gimli the dwarf who is now the comic relief of the movie, when Merri and Pippin are most of the time in the woods with the ents, where they have nothing to joke about. It doesn´t bother me, Gimli´s jokes are funnier, although he hasn´t got as good a comment as in the previous film; 'Nobody tosses a dwarf!'Most of the running time is spend in the kingdom of Rohan, where Théoden tries to avoid war against evil wizard Saruman´s uruk-hai armies. It´s not all boring, but the second hour seems to last much longer than the first or the third. Jackson has spiced up the dullest parts of the book by adding a fight against orcs riding wargs, kind of hyena-like beasts and Aragorn and Arwen missing each other.The last hour is the best of this film and the whole trilogy so far. First, there´s the massive battle of Helm´s deep. The despair of the defenders feels in the air as 100 000 uruk-hais and orcs march in front of the fort and start shouting to taunt their opponents. It´s hard to believe most of those soldiers are CG. The viewer feels like s/he´s in the battle itself and dives even deeper to despair when the enemy breaks the walls and beats the hell out of Rohan´s soldiers. But in the morning, when Gandalf rides in with the Riders of Rohan the viewer´s despair changes to joy and relief. Peter Jackson sure can create great feelings. Although the film is not as good as the first one, it doesn´t deserve anything less, than the full points.10/10The best part (SPOILER): The final march of the ents. I felt very good seeing the tree people finally paying back to Saruman by coming to his fortress, Eisengard, and starting to wreck the place up! STOMP! Orcs get squashed! WHAM! Orcs get crushed under a big rock thrown by an ent! KER-SPLOOSH! The ents break the dam and the river sweeps all the smaller creatures into Saruman´s mine pit! It can´t get any better than this! Oh, I can´t wait for the third and final movie!",9,0,0,13 September 2003
Reservoir Dogs," My top ten movies of all time #5
","This is Quentin Tarantino's (referred from now on as QT) first movie ever and it, like many other debuts of great directors (like Terry Gilliam, Peter Jackson, John Carpenter or Sergio Leone) has been made with considerably small budget. This is only good because it has forced QT to focus on the story and the relationships and not to some gimmicks like the three separate stories in Pulp Fiction or the huge battle scenes in Kill Bill vol. 1 (not to say of course that these movies aren't great too). Small cast and a simple setting in an abandoned warehouse bring the best up. Keitel and Roth are great and Madsen and Buscemi have the best roles in their whole career. And even the smallest roles are noteworthy; Stephen Wright as the bored DJ of K-BILLY always makes me smile. It has been said that this movie is not an important one because everything in it has been taken from another movie. You know, the color codes from Taking of Pelham 1-2-3, the set up from the Killing etc. But I disagree. If not else, this movie introduced the world what the new generation of movie-makers was capable of. The one, who has grown up watching old movies from TV. And of course every movie maker in the world can learn how QT makes the characters more human by making them have normal discussions about Pam Grier or Madonna's songs or tipping or anything like that, what we discuss every day or his choice of music. Normally music is suited to the movie to depict the emotions or to strenghen the scene or to earn more money with soundtrack albums that have new songs by hit artists like Jerry Bruckheimer does. On QT's soundtrack there is some old music from the 70's which was so out of fashion in 1992 as possible. But it works. The music choices are of course great and they also succeed in bringing up an eerie feeling when they are used in an improper scene. Like 'Stuck in the Middle with You' in the ear-slicing scene. All in all, no matter what everyone else says, this movie deserves to be one of the best movies in the 90's and the fifth in my top ten list of best movies of all time. The only downside is that the movie is perhaps a little too short. I would've liked to know Mr. Pink's story for instance.9/10The best part: The Psychopathic Mr. Blonde dances to 'Stuck in the Middle with You' with a razor blade in front of a tied-up cop, the camera tilts to the left and comes back and Mr. Blonde has the cop's ear in his hand. Then he shouts to the ear; 'Hey, what's going' on?'",9,0,1,11 August 2004
The Matrix Reloaded," Not very clever but fun.
","This movie splits people into two groups; the first think it´s absolute crap, the acting is horrible, the philosophical questions are stupid etc. The other group doesn´t mind any of this, but rather concentrates on the excellent action sequences. They think the movie is great. I´m a part of the latter group.The movie starts kind of dull. The scenes with the senate of Zion made me fear this could turn out to be as bad sequel as the two latest Star Wars-movies. My fears became bigger with the cave scene which is easily the worst part of the film. Annoying Blade-like trance and people jumping around, while Neo has a dull sex scene with Trinity. Blah! Luckily, the scene is soon over and the film starts getting better. The Seraph and the oracle got me interested of this movie again. And then the words: 'Mr Anderson! Surprised to see me?' begin this this great rollercoaster of incredibly great action sequence. The Burly Brawl, the fight with the Merovingian´s henchmen (and woman) and the freeway chase. It can be seen, that this movie´s staff has seen A LOT of trouble seeing these films. And as the freeway sequence itself took 3 months to finish, that must be true.In the philosophical departement, the movie tries too hard to be as clever as the first part. The oracle´s words are interesting but the Merovingian and especially the Architect are like the end or the video game Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty. No one understand anything and therefore think it wasn´t much of a plot. By the way, the plot itself also resembles a videogame: 'Let´s go to meet the Architect, so the war will be over! Uh-oh! We can´t go there without the key. Let´s go get the key-maker! Uh-oh! He´s been imprisoned by a fake frenchman and his goons! Let´s fight them!' Kind of dull, comparing what the plot of the first Matrix was.Finally, the actors. Many times I´ve heard someone complaining the actors were as if they were made of wood. Well, Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Ann Moss do not act as good as their characters should. Laurence Fishburne is a little better, but not much. However, there is also some good acting in this movie. Gloria Foster as the Oracle is as great as in the first movie. My favorite is still Hugo Weaving´s agent Smith. He´s like as he is full of evil and his phrases ('Smith will suffice', 'Me, me, me.' 'Me too' and the already once mentioned 'Mr. Anderson! Surprised to see me?') are the only smilable parts of this movie. Weaving´s got a strange way of speaking. I guess that is because he is actually british, but talks in the movie as an american.All in all, this may not be as great as the first film, but I will still reccommend this to anyone who likes good action and doesn´t like to complain about every little detail. Oh, and if you haven´t seen 'the Matrix' watch that first. You can´t understand anything in the movie if you haven´t see that one. 8/10The Best part:(SPOILER)Neo has a Burly Brawl with a lot of agent Smiths. At one point one fallen agent shouts furiously 'More' and from the nearby door comes A LOT more of the clones. They pile in top of Neo, but he manages to escape. Finally, Neo throws one Smith at the others, which makes a sound like bowling a strike. Then Neo flies off leaving the agents looking calmly up to the sky and then slowly walking away.",7,0,0,18 October 2003
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," A villain's movie
","The Revenge of the Sith is an unusual movie in a way as it's not trying to tell a story about 'what' is happening, but rather 'how' some things everyone knows are going to happen. Let's face it, there's no way anyone is going to see this without having seen at least one Star Wars movie before or has heard of the famous climax of the Empire Strikes Back. So, basically everyone knows how this is going to turn out. Darkly. Bad for the good guys. Especially one key character, that links all six Star Wars movies together. But the fun is seeing 'how' this is going to happen and happily, I'll have to say it's quite convincing. Darkness has always done good for Star Wars. The best one is still Empire, but this is definitely the best of the new trilogy.For the dark story of a character's turning to evil, you'll need some tragedy, some fear of loss, and of course a manipulative baddie out for his own. Ian McDiarmid is great as Palpatine. He sure knows, how to play out his cards. A lie there, a half-truth there and a bad encouragement there and voilá: He's become the ruler of the galaxy. He's a real mastermind, because he had control over a whole war and its both armies the whole time. The previous prequels didn't take much interest in him or the other villains, which I thought was a bad thing, but now as I see what Palpatine was aiming for I'm really stunned. I might even re-watch Menace and Clones (only seen both once!) to take a closer look at his scheming.As most people will say, most of the other acting is as wooden and dull as ever. The thing is, that as George Lucas had left the majority of things that were mentioned in the Original Trilogy for this movie, the movie rolls along so quickly, it leaves preciously little time for the characters to chat. And Jar-Jar doesn't have one line in the movie (Phew!)! There are occasional stupid moments, but as this is a Star Wars movie, I'm willing to forgive. I forgave Spider-man 2 also, didn't I? As Return of the Jedi had its Ewoks and Phantom Menace its Gungans, I'll have to say I hated one character obviously created for toy marketing purposes. It's General Grievous, the Jedi-hunting half-alien, half-cyborg with a stupid Caribbean accent (Hello, racism accusations as after Phantom Menace) and a bad cough. This stupid character who resembles a video game boss with his four arms and Transformers-like changing ability. It's the modern day ewoks all over again, but this time Lucas has figured that PlayStation games sell more than plush toys. I was happy to see Grievous get killed. If only they had a similar scene with Jar-Jar... Or the new-model R2, with electric shock-gun, jetpack and ability to speak words like uh-oh. Curious how 3PO is the one with his memory erased, but R2 is the one who forgot how to use his abilities in all the later episodes.**** Best part: A tie between two McDiarmid's scenes: The Sith legend he tells Anakin (and still he can't figure out, that he's a sith!) and the fight with him and Mace Windu. Bad time for an entrance, boy...",5,0,0,27 May 2005
X2: X-Men United," Better that its predecessor
","It's very rare that a sequel is better than the original. It's even rarer that a very good movie has an excellent sequel. But super-hero movies manage to do that; Spider-man 2, Batman Returns, Superman II and X2 all improved their originals.The first movie had interesting themes concerning intolerance against mutants. It was compared to hatred against Jews, communists and homosexuals. Unfortunately, the movie's action was a bit dull and it seemed that its edges weren't smoothed down quite enough. Some sub-plots didn't get anywhere and the movie seemed too short. Nevertheless it was a happy surprise, that an action movie can be so thoughtful and woke an interest to the X-men comics in me (I can't tell the difference between Dr. Doom and the Hobgoblin, so don't think I only liked this movie because I love the comics!)This one gives a lot of thought to the themes too. Iceman 'comes out of the closet' to his family, who react by saying 'Have you tried not being a mutant?' Also casting Alan Cumming and Ian McKellen, who are both openly homosexual is a clear hint to the themes.This movie does it all better. Some characters, like Jean Grey and Mystique have more time on the screen as they did on the first movie and new character Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming) almost steals the show. However, some characters, like Cyclops and Iceman are still left in the background, but you can't have all in one movie. Maybe in X3 we'll see some stunning scenes with them.The story's focus is on Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), who will find out more about his past, as hinted out in the first movie. Another primary character is Professor Xavier (Patrick Steward), who is being used against his will as a tool to destroy all mutants. The bad guy isn't Ian McKellen's Magneto this time, but general William Stryker who holds a grudge against the mutants because of his son, who is also a mutant.This movie has more action this time, but fortunately it doesn't interfere with the plot. This is how more action movies should be made; the action alongside the story, not showing only neat CG-sequences, although this movie contains CG, too. Mystique's shape-chancing's are wonderful, but Pyro's flame attack doesn't look quite real. But I'm not complaining, the movie's too good to start nitpicking.**** 1/2 (9/10)The best part (SPOILER): Magneto escapes from the prison in a quite cunning way; He takes the iron out of a guards blood and floats on a disc he's made from the iron, while killing the other guards with smaller iron balls.",8,0,0,22 December 2003
RED," The Expendables for old character actors
","RED is a big ensemble action movie, and thus must be compared to the recent The Expendables. RED is better. But it is by no means a perfect movie either.Like The Expendables, your enjoyment of RED depends largely of how much you get a kick out of the actors on screen. And I for one love more old, crazy character actors than wrestlers and other muscle stars, even though I love 80's action films with all my heart. In addition to leading Bruce Willis, you'll get John Malkovich, Helen Mirren, Brian Cox, Morgan Freeman, and a couple of smaller parts I don't care to reveal yet, even though they are found on the cast list. And all these actors seem to have a genuinely good time - for once they get to shoot guns instead of doing boring drama. Except for Bruce who has a boring romantic subplot - that at least happens among all the action and not bizarrelly stopping it a'la The E-movie. Without the cast, or even with just Bruce, the film would be sort of a lacklustre spy thriller, even if it has a few truly kick-ass sequences (most of them are found in the trailer). But Malkovich and Cox in particular always bring a smile to my face, even with some lesser material.One thing that really bugged me about this film was the use of music. It was way too generic and comedic and always too loud. I get that RED is supposed to be an action comedy, but the makers should take a page from the ZAZ filmmaking: Everything is much funnier when done with a straight face. Without the wink wink -attitude this could've been an even greater action film. But I still enjoyed it a lot.*** / ***** http://fastmovieblog.blogspot.com/",6,0,1,2 November 2010
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Just another praising comment on the biggest film of our time
","This film has been praised to high heavens by everyone, it is currently #2 in the IMDb highest-voted movies of all time-list and it won 11 of the most wanted of all movie prices, including Best Picture. So why should I write another review of it? I probably won't have anything new to say, unless I absolutely loathed the film. Which is the furthest from the truth as can be. I'm writing this simply for my love for the biggest film of our time.This film as anything finally shows us how perfectly Peter Jackson has captured the book. I still don't think anyone could make a better adaptation. Jackson was wise enough to choose actors instead of stars in the roles as this part requires them more than anything. And although I was suspicious at first, all the hobbit actors hit just the right spot, Billy Boyd and Dom Monaghan ARE more than just token comic reliefs and Sean Astin really shines this time around as the bravest hobbit of them all Samwise 'the brave' Gamgee. Without great actors, this movie could feel like a regular hack 'n slash action movie set in a fantasy world, but with great actor work and a great script the story's themes of friendship, courage and sacrifice are really the main attractions, not just the stunning action scenes. Just like in the good ole epics like Lawrence of Arabia.Something that should also be noted in the trilogy is the wonderful music of Howard Shore. Truly, he is the new John Williams, who can create noticeable and endlessly hummable main themes, threatening pre-battle music or soft, idyllic music for a simple village like Hobbiton. The viewer feels easier the atmosphere of the location with the help of fitting music. And it couldn't fit better than in this one.It's notable now that the most respected directors, such as Quentin Tarantino and Steven Spielberg talk regularly against using too many fake-looking computer-effects in movies. I agree that the traditional effect-making is usually more stunning and some classics, like the Thing or An American Werewolf in London couldn't have the same effect if they were made with computers. But The Lord of the Rings trilogy really shows that sometimes CGI can be as magical. They probably couldn't have made the epic battle scenes or characters like Gollum without computers. The trick seems to be to use them just the right amount and not just to attract the viewers, as most movies nowadays do, but to help the story, as they did in this one.If some downsides should be mentioned, it would be that even with 3 1/2 hours in the regular cut, the story doesn't focus enough on some things and tells a little too much of some other things. Most people think, that leaving Saruman out was a mistake. I agree, but I'd rather had seen the Houses of Healing scene between Eowyn and Faramir. The movie needs also some tenderness and at least one fully written female character. Fortunatlelly, these scenes are on the DVD and also there's plenty of Miranda Otto otherwise in the theatrical cut. ***** (10/10, the best films I've seen #2)The Best Part (SPOILER): A very hard choice, but I would say the part when Gollum and Frodo have a final fight from the ring inside Mount Doom as Aragorn and co. fight Sauron's immense army is the most effective for me",9,2,5,5 January 2005
The Matrix," Gets better every time I see it
","This site categorizes Action movies rather strange. Sure, some classics like Kurosawa´s the Seven Samurai have action in them, but they are not actually action movies since officially the whole genre began to evolve from the Clint Eastwood movies of the 70´s and George Lucas´s Star Wars and Indiana Jones trilogy. After this, we´ve seen quite a lot of action movies as some of the world´s most successful movies are also. Most of them include a muscled, dumb man like Sylvester Stallone, Jean-Claude van Damme or Chuck Norris killing a lot of terrorists. Some of them, however are a lot more than just murdering terrorists. Some Action movies have a heart, they contain also a lot other beside carnage. Some of these movies are  James Cameron´s Aliens and Terminator, Brian Singer´s X-men movies or, of course, the Matrix, which is one of the best action movies of all time.Ok, so the movie´s plot has some similarities to the Terminator or Blade Runner of something, but they do not have such an imaginative picture of the future or the artificial reality it contains. I hate say it, but the only word I can explain this movies greatness, is cool. It looks cool, it feels cool, all the Action is so cool, that loads of action movies have tried to copy its coolness after this, but in my opinion, they have not succeeded very well. Yes, this does get better by every watching, as the first time goes marveling at the wonders of the artificial world, evil kung-fu agents, the resistance and even computer effects, which look after four years almost as good as then. For the next couple of times, as you sink 'deeper into the rabbit hole' you start to think about the philosophical questions this movie gives. And yes, still enjoy the action. It almost deserves a ten, but the movie has a few annoying plot holes and I´m not a big fan of Carrie-Ann Moss, not even in her Catwoman outfit. So, 9/10The Best bit (May contain SPOILERs): When Trinity and Neo come to the Matrix to rescue Morpheus from the Agents, they have to pass a metal detector at the lobby. When Neo goes through it, it naturally beeps. He reveals to the guard he has a LOT of weapons under his coat. The guard goes: 'Holy Sh*t!' And the shooting begins!",9,1,2,28 August 2003
Jackie Brown," Tarantino's most adult work
","Jackie Brown is probably the most adult work of director Quentin Tarantino. Although the name and star Pam Grier hint for a blacksploitation-style movie, the movie never feels like any kind of exploitation. There are numerous references to movies like Foxy Brown and many songs in the background are ripped from their soundtracks, but the movie itself is actually quite calm. It has some violence but it's not very explicit ea. it's shown off-screen. This is not how Tarantino movies usually are. Another thing that freaks us Tarantino fans out is that in the movie characters talk mainly about stuff that's related to the plot, there's barely any mention of old TV-series or Kung-fu movies of the 70's. This is why the movie also feels less Tarantino than his other work. This may be due to this being an adaptation of Elmore Leonard's the Rum Punch and not an entirely new story from QT's warped mind.All this does not make this movie a bad one. In fact it's surprising how little actually happens in the movie, it's mainly just talk until the last 40 minutes or so. Yet Tarantino clearly has a gift with words, you will always feel interested about what a character says. Speaking of characters, Tarantino has usually a marvelous cast, but this puts the likes of Pulp Fiction to shame. Pam Grier is great at the title role, Robert DeNiro gives us yet another immortal role and Samuel L. Jackson does a superb arms-dealer who thinks a little too much of himself. Yet the best performance comes from Robert Foster, who is really the heart of the movie as a bail-payer, who becomes interested in Jackie Brown's scheme to steal the money his boss wants to smuggle to America. The relationship between Foster's character and Jackie is touching, almost like Vince and Mia in Pulp Fiction, as it's an almost love-story which ends before it even starts.The plot is actually like a Seinfeld episode without the jokes. All characters seem to have different interests at first, but later all the plot points tie in together. And this time Tarantino actually tells the story linear, not by some jumps in time back and forth. It's actually a working solution for this film. We Tarantino fans got a little worried there when he made such a straight movie, quit for six years, but we certainly were rewarded as his next one was the two-volume roaring rampage of revenge, his most exploitational movie yet.**** (8/10)",8,1,3,1 March 2005
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Ekki-ekki-ekki-ekki-z'Bang zoom-Boing z'nourrrwringmmmni
","First of all I think it's unfair of comedies to get a big cult status. If the best jokes come too well known, the element of surprise is gone. This happened to me for example in the case of This is Spinal Tap. I had heard about the Stonehenge gag, the amplifier that goes up to 11 and the part where they get lost. So, if you haven't seen this movie yet, I suggest you wouldn't read this, because it really does spoil great comedy, if you know too much about it in the first place.The movie is set in medieval England ...or is it? Maybe I should start again.This one is probably the funniest of all Monty Python movies, but not the best. The clever satire of Life of Brian and the wonderful visual feast of the Meaning of Life make them superior to this. There's really not anything more than a bunch of typical pythonesque sketches in this one. Which, of course isn't a bad thing at all.It's said often, that because the movie's budget was very low is why they had to use the infamous coconuts instead of horses. But then again, how come they had enough money for the Trojan rabbit, the army of celts in the end or Tim the enchanter's explosions? Well, most of the action sequences are animated anyway. And that's another plus, because this is the only Python movie, where the great Terry Gilliam animations pop up as often as they did in Flying Circus. Maybe because making them gave Terry a heart attack (in the movie, at least), he only animated the opening credits in LOB and MOL. Too bad, because this has also the best and funniest opening credits, ever! Signed, Richard M. Nixon.The Pythons really are genius in both writing and acting. Particularly funny are Cleese as the Frenchman and the Black Knight, Chapman as King Arthur, Palin as the leader of the knights of Ni and Dennis, Idle as the Dead Collector and Sir Robin, Jones as Prince Herbert and sir Bedevere and even the rarely seen Terry Gilliam has his Bridgekeeper, one of the funniest characters of the whole movie. All of the characters have also enormous amounts of memorable quotes and that makes this without a doubt the most quoted movie of all times. That just proves that even if the movie has some years to it, it hasn't lost any of it's appeal just because some new comedies like There's something about Mary and American Pie go even deeper into the pile of bad taste. Give me the cartoon-violent Black Knight scene over the sperm-as-hair-gel any day!***** (9/10)The best part: (SPOILERs) The hack 'n slash Black Knight scene is the best splatter sequence from a non-splatter movie! Also I really love the Bridge of Death (Answer these questions three: What is your name? What is your quest? What is your favorite colour? You wouldn't think answering those could be THAT hard) and of course, everyone's favorite monster, the Killer rabbit and favourite villains, the Knights who say Ni (or Ekki-ekki-ekki-ekki-z'Bang zoom-Boing z'nourrrwringmmmni) who want some nice shrubberies, which are not too expensive and make people cut down trees with a herring.",9,0,2,28 September 2004
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The best sequel I've ever seen!
","Movie sequels do not often improve the original film. In the science-fiction genre, there are however some exceptions. Movies like Aliens, X-men 2 and Bride of Frankenstein improved their already great predecessors (Many would add Terminator 2, but I won't, because I prefer small budget action-cyber-thrillers to big-budget bonanzas). The greatest sequel (I haven't seen Godfather II and I do not count Return of the King as a sequel) of all time is none other than the Empire Strikes Back.As Star Wars was just an amusing little adventure flick with one-dimensional characters and a simple story, however well made and funny, ESB is a lot deeper in comparison. The characters have real emotions now and the universe is a lot more dangerous place than before. Just look at the Luke in the first film, who is sadder for the death of Ben, who he knew only two days, than he is after his aunt and uncle, who have raised him as their own son, die. Now, compare him to the Luke in the sequel, and his despair as Vader tells him his secret in the very famous scene. It's a shame Mark Hamill's career went only downhill from here, because he could've done some great 'serious' acting (Oh, come on. He's playing the Trickster as Harrison Ford makes billions with each of his movies).Fortunately, the humor has survived from the original film. Chewie, C3PO and Han vs. Leia tongue lashings still create giggles, but the funniest character is of course Jedi Master Yoda. It's brilliant how they could make a demented old muppet, who can't speak sentences with the right word order, a respectable icon of wisdom.Although the humor, the story is a lot darker than in the previous film. Deception, death and war are constantly present, and come together in one of the best climaxes I've ever seen.The Empire Strikes Back has almost everything that one could wish for; strange creatures, romance, humor, darkness (not the band you twit!) and epic fights both in space and on the ground. The only downside is, that the story is left unfinished in the end, but one could always see the next episode of the Star Wars saga, The Return of the Jedi right after finishing this movie. This one should be shown to cynics, who loathe science fiction. If this doesn't turn them into fans of the genre, nothing will.10/10The Best Part (SPOILERS):Oh, there's so many to choose from! Some of my favorites are; the climatic lightsaber fight, Han Solo being dipped into carbonite, Millennium Falcon getting lost inside a giant space worm, the rebels succeeding in stopping the Walkers in Hoth with tying their legs together with rope and Luke fighting bogus Vader inside the tree of knowledge, killing him and seeing that the face behind the mask is really himself.",9,0,1,28 May 2004
Jurassic Park," Yay, dinosaurs!
","When I was a kid, I was really into dinosaurs. So when Jurassic Park came to the movie theaters it was like all my dreams had come true. The dinosaurs lived again. Well, I was eight. I grew up a little and the two sequels never really felt the same (Plus the fact that they are, especially #2, lame). And recently, when I re-watched the original movie I found it was actually kind of childish (well, it's a Spielberg movie) and full of the plot holes so big, T-Rex could get through them (and it did. In the end, when it entered the museum silently.).Although the movie is twelve years old, its computer-created dinosaurs still look very realistic. That's a small wonder, regarding that most movies with effects a few years old look obsolete now, like Spider-Man or the Star Wars prequels. They rank alongside King Kong and Harryhausen's Thalos as stunning effects made with love, that make them last throughout ages. And no, dinos are not on the screen a second too little. Just look at what happened, when they were on the screen all the time in the Lost World! I'll have to say the movie is well paced meaning it's a good mixture of live actors talking and CG dinosaurs trying to eat them. The actors are good, the best being Sir Richard Attenburough. Wayne 'Newman' Knight is a fun baddie, whereas Samuel L. Jackson has a rare role, where he doesn't steal every scene. In fact, you'll probably forget that he's even in it quite soon. And even the children are OK. As this is a childhood movie for me, I can't get through a comment without talking some more about the dinosaurs. They are, of course, the real stars of the show. The best are the raptors, of course. I also like the Dilophosaurus (the one that kills Wayne Knight), but that may be due to the action figure I had, which could spit just like in the movie. ****the Best Part (SPOILER): When the children are hiding in the kitchen and the raptors come in was scary as a kid, but it's still ace.",8,1,2,1 September 2003
