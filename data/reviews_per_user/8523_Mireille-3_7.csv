The Blair Witch Project," Getting scared over a bundle of sticks
","If you still believe that there is a ghost hiding underneath your bed, yes than you will probably find this movie to be scary, but otherwise.....not for one moment did my heart skip a beat (for the record: I watched Scream1 entirely through a buttonhole of my coat..) And watching three people arguing over the fact that they are lost is very recognizable but after a while you start to think: oh for crying out loud pull yourself together!!. The only thing I liked was the last scene, but to sit trough the whole movie just for one scene, No I wouldn't recommend it, you'd better take a long walk through the woods by yourself at night and if you do, make sure to leave your camera at home...",Null,1,1,3 November 1999
Brokeback Mountain," Much ado about nothing
","Maybe it is a better movie when you actually watch in the theatre and not at home, like I did... at home it was certainly not very entertaining. I had a hard time not hitting the fast forward button on my remote control. Can someone please tell me what the fuss was about, or better yet, why it has won several Oscars? To me the story line deserved more elaboration than it was given. I was not quite convinced of the genuine love between the two main characters. And come on, to me a love story does not need to show a lot of flesh, but a bit of fumbling in the dark is very, very prudish. Great scenery though....would have been even better on a large screen",6,3,20,29 December 2006
Spotlight," Solid movie
","A solid movie, though I was not fully captivated. The story emphasizes on the importance of a strong independent press. A very important story of course. The story of abuse in the Catholic church serves more as a vehicle to highlight this. The actors did a great job but to me they did not blend in as much as I would like them. Mark Ruffalo is just too much Mark Ruffalo as is Michael Keaton very much Michael Keaton. I would have added a few less known actors to the cast to make it more natural. To me Liev Schreiber was the most credible, Stanley Tucci (with hair!) did also a great job. Watching the movie it had a bit of a old fashioned feel of the 70ths, any moment Robert Redford could show up, and I think that is the reason I was not completely convinced. I was constantly reminded of All the president's men and that was just a better movie.",7,2,4,29 January 2016
The Revenant," Over the top
","Boy, I had a difficult time watching this movie. It is just to much of the same thing and the same emotion. Dicaprio had an easy time learning his lines, because not many words came out of his mouth, a lot of grunting instead that gets annoying quite quickly. There was a lot of laughter amongst the audience, not because the movie is funny, but is is at many times over the top and highly unlikely. Yes the nature is beautiful but I'd rather watch an episode of BBC earth, that is a lot more uplifting. Overall the movie was quite disappointing. I don't get the praise at all. The script can be summarized in one page, and that is not a good thing.",3,11,19,30 January 2016
The Legend of 1900," A beautifully told fairytale
","The legend of 1900 is a fairlytale-like story of a man who grew up on a ship and spent his entire life there while playing the piano like no one had ever done before. It is at times funny, tragic and sad. The music is very easy on the ear, especially when 1900 meets the love of his life. But most of all I liked the part of the film when 1900 explains why he never left the ship. 1900 liked the fact that on board of the ship the possibilities are not infinite whereas on land the fact that there so many streets and so many places to go made him feel desperate. I agree with another commentator who said that this story is the story for the next millenium. The fact that with all the new technology the motto seems to be that the sky is the limit one wonders whether this is really an improvement or just an unnecessary complication of life. And before I forget, Tim Roth and his trumpet playing friend Max are- to my opinion- acting their best.",Null,0,0,6 December 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," Keep your eyes firmly shut and your ears too
","When I went to see this movie, I noticed that there were a lot of young men, far more than usual, in the theatre. All lured by the hype I suppose. The hype turned out to be a hoax, as far as I am concerned, but a very funny one. I nearly smothered myself while trying to suppress laughing during the movie so that I was glad that there was a break during which I could catch my breath. Boy oh boy,what a facade of seriousness, give me a break. The piano score was highly irritating, but again added to my fun. Frankly, I cannot think of more to say about this movie, cause nothing more happened on screen. They did a bad, bad thing.... More accurately would be they thought of doing a bad, bad thing, and they thought of it rather slowly. Definitely one for the fast forward!!!",Null,0,0,27 September 1999
The Matrix," I have seen better
","Well, a lot has been said about of this movie, so I will keep it short. Maybe I have seen one action movie too many, but the Matrix isn't a very special one. Actually I thought it was rather boring and slow and one big Nokia commercial for which you actually have to pay money to see it. A lot of cliche oneliners like 'it is my way or the highway', oh come on.....I rate this movie a 4 out of 10",Null,0,0,27 June 1999
