Ford v Ferrari," IT'S GOOD BUT IT COULD BE BETTER
","Ford v Ferrari has a lot of positive things, altough it didn t surprised me at all as an entire film. The movie explains with all the details the story we went to see but does not show us almost nothing emotionally related to the main characters, and that is unacceptable having Christian Bale and Matt Damon on stage. I had much better expectations",7,1,4,27 November 2019
Meet Joe Black," Has some good things, others not so good
",Liked it. I enjoyed watching it except for some scenes i found too long and repetitive. I think the story was ok but i personally didn't like claire fontaine's character and maybe the acting didn't help too. Pitt acted pretty well and Hopkins even better. I recommend it though i would not consider this as a great movie.,6,0,0,3 June 2020
There Will Be Blood," Nothing interesting, Worths watching for it's acting.
","DD Lewis and Paul Dano showing lessons of acting to everyone, altough poor story. I had no emotions by watching this truly, maybe only excitement about how good Lewis was acting. I wouldn't reccomend this to anyone, the film lasts 2:40 hs and nothing interesting happens with the story. Very Very overrated.",6,0,2,27 April 2020
Whiplash," Excellent film
","Those who dislike it because of the sadism are people who just do not know how to see a movie. Good screenplay, great actings and great work from the director. This is a just a story which you wether like it or not, but you can't criticise it because of the sadistic parts and less criticise how realistic this is when we are talking about A FILM, it doesn t need to be 100 per cent real you idiots. If by watching this you feel really intense or somo anxiety then that is what you are supposed to feel, the idea of the film is for you to get those feelings and that is not bad. I mean no one critices for example a horror film for its sadism or unetical scenes, far away from that you see it to get scared, so it is the same here, doesn't need be totally real.",8,0,0,12 April 2020
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," 'Down of Justice' makes no justice to Nolan' saga
","Too many effects for nothing, some of them really bad, poor screenplay and cheap direction. Besides this, there are a few things that makes you feel like frustrated in different moments, examples like Batman' suit (excesive), the fight between the two heroes ( too long and bad ending) and obviously the fight that comes at the end against that monster ( that monster makes no sense). So i didn't like the heroes or the villans + the story. What can i say? It will be really difficult to DC equalize Christopher Nolan's Batman series. 'Down of Justice' makes no justice to that saga at all.",4,2,7,3 May 2020
