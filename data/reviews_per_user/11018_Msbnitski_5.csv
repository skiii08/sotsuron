The Lobster," Colin Farrell, you are much better than this.
","I'm reading a lot of the reviews which are mixed. I thought it was me but I do not think so. This movie drags along trying to be funny or maybe meaningful. I didn't find either.
The plot in the end really makes no sense at all. A utopian society? Really? Finding a mate, hunting or dying or being turned into an animal? Or hunting others for what really?
Nothing to speak of is explained and you slog along trying to find meaning in this film and I found none. I'm a big film buff but this was neither funny or meaningful in any way. That being said, I would take a pass on this film unless you are bored and have nothing else to occupy your brain or your time.
Others found meaning and sense behind it but me, nothing, zero. No humor, no social meaning. What are we reduced to hunting our significant others then killing them or someone else? What and why? You decide whatever this movie means. Some equated it to the The Grand Budapest Hotel, that was funny and you could follow along with the silliness but this, no.
Take a pass, please.Colin Farrell, you are much better than this.",4,1,2,30 January 2019
Pirate Radio," Growing up in the 60's
","Wow. I grew up in the 60's and into the early 70's and this movie says a lot of what we were all feeling if you were into the British invasion and the USA rock and lovin' it roll. If you were there, in the moment, you can really appreciate this movie.I saw this movie years ago and came upon it again just today and it is still as good as the first time I saw it. Come on, British rock, mini skirts, white boo ga loo boots and everything else that came from Britain. Life was fun, exciting and free. I can only wish that new generations can listen to the wonderful sounds of British and new wave US rock from that era. It was a great time to be alive!",10,2,2,11 October 2019
Crash," This movie says a lot about our human race.
","I have seen this movie a few times. Each time I watch it I see even more about the human behavior. We as people say so much without us really seeing or hearing what we are actually saying. Our upbringing and our social behavior into adulthood are shaped by so many factors. Parents, teachers and family.We as a human race need to take a deep breath, take a step back and see how our everyday behavior affects so many people. We can say we are not bigots, racists or whatever you want to say to make yourself feel better but, our speech, actions and motives show others as to who we are as people.This movie says a lot about the human race, people no matter what their background, religion or color, we are all of the same. Think what you may, we can learn a lot about ourselves from this film and our everyday existence on this planet. We need more movies like this to expose ourselves and others as to who and what we are as people.",10,0,0,22 March 2020
Blow," Great movie, to be watched again & again.
","I have watched this movie many times, to many to count. Having grown up in this timeline and atmosphere, I can relate to the grab that drugs will have on a person. Drugs can make a person very rich. Drugs can also ruin a persons life and those around them.That time of life, the 1960's into the present day was a time when people realized they could make an incredible amount of money. dealing drugs They also had to balance the fact that their life could and might be ruined along with others around them. I'm also aware that drugs were around earlier in time but, this movie is about this time frame and the people depicted.Johnny Depp was very good in this particular acting role. He was very believable and was very well done in his adaptation of the drug lord. I have watched this movie many times and it's still amazing as to how the drug trade moved along as it did. Penelope Cruz and her crazy drug infused ego and feeling nothing could satisfy her needs, she just wanted more of whatever may have made her feel better at that moment. Snort, spend, feel sorta better, repeat.It's a life lesson as to what not to get involved in even though you can make a bundle of money and everyone and everything close to you can and will be ruined by your actions. A great movie in values and morals.",10,2,2,10 August 2019
Black Panther," What an over hyped movie
","I suppose if you are 10, this is a great movie. I expected more. The hype around this movie made me want to watch it and I got about an hour into it on Netflix, free thanks (?) and turned it off. Boring.
It was a poor mixture of Avatar and other comics but this, it was made very poorly. You could see the effects were in front of numerous green screens, the flying machines were poorly done, the costumes were colorful. The plot was predictable, father is killed or died and son takes the lead. I was rooting for the bad son that was left behind in the hood but he couldn't pull it off either. He just couldn't blend in.
Lots of Hollywood names but they couldn't do much for the movie. I liked the kings sister with the techno stuff but Forest Whitaker? Was he bored or looking for something to do? He's so much better than this and so was Angela Bassett.
If you are a young kid, enjoy, otherwise, take a big pass on this bomb.",2,3,5,25 September 2018
