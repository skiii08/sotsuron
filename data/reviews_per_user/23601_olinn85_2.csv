Despicable Me 2," A hard step down from it's predecessor
","I loved Despicable me, it had heart, excitement and humor for both children and adults.DM2 felt like a watered down version of it' predecessor, gone were jokes that adults could laugh at and instead the only comic relief came from the Minions doing idiotic things like they did in the previous one. However it gets tiresome quickly, even my 5 year old was getting bored by the end of the movie.I love good animated movies especially when me and my daughter both find them entertaining, that's really a mark of a good movie when it can reach adults and children alike.Despicable Me 2 never really took off, and was a total dud for me (and my kid)",5,3,4,14 October 2013
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Good but not great.
","I've seen all the Marvel movies leading up to this one, and maybe Guardians of the Galaxy was just too good to follow.A:Age of Ultron has a solid build up, but there are way too many slow chapters in it that both are uninteresting and poorly paced, but it kicks into gear again and finishes strong.For me, Ultron was way too much just a robot James Spader, his classic wit and behavior seeped through and well.. I've heard that James Spader before a million times, so I never really connected to Ultron as a villain. And a movie like this with a Villain that doesn't get you either feeling a bit for him or utterly hating him, is lacking.For me Age of Ultron was too much a stepping stone for the next Marvel movies, The Avengers movies should be the pinnacle of a story arc, not a chapter in the middle.All in all a decent showing, but not even close to the first Avengers and even coming in behind CA: The Winter Soldier for me.",7,1,5,26 April 2015
