The Longest Yard," Good kicks, near touchdown
","I'm going to start off by admitting that I had no interest in this movie whatsoever. I only saw it because I was dragged. Was it as bad as I thought? Not at all. It was way better than I expected it to be. We all know those mindless comedies that barely have a plot, cheap dialogue and jokes, and are just filled with stupidities galore. I thought this was one of them. I was wrong. This remake had a pretty good storyline and a few laughable jokes and moments. I usually don't laugh out loud at movies, but I did find myself doing so three or four times here. So that takes care of the Funniness Factor. The story is easy to get involved in--you want to see the prisoners kick the guards' butts in football. It is a well played story and fun to watch. Sandler is not one of my favorite actors, but I have to give him his props because I am starting to see that he usually stars in movies that are at least remotely funny and that have a pretty decent plot. But the main thing is that his characters usually act the same. I would get into the slight lack of character development, but I'm sure you don't care to read about that. You only wish to know if this movie is funny or not and if it's worth watching! Well, yes the movie has its moments and it's good to watch, especially if you like football or are a Sandler fan. This has its good kicks and it is near a touchdown in the comedy category. So if you want to have a good time and relax to some entertainment, you can watch this one =) 6.6/10 Stars",7,42,67,6 June 2005
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," The Magnificent Lion, the Evil With, and the Magical Wardrobe
","Wow. Simply wow. That is all I can say after having the luxury of screening this movie a day early. The visuals are gorgeous, the music is beautiful--everything is simply amazing. This movie takes us to the world of Narnia. I will say that as a movie, this is excellent. Those unfamiliar with the book will enjoy it. I did read it, and I will tell all of you who have read it as well--you will not be disappointed. Sure, some dialogue is left out; some scenes are cut and/or extended; and some things are not explained--but this is the MOVIE version of Narnia. If we want it exactly as the book, we might as well just read it again. This film stays true to the important and outstanding parts from the book, and I was simply awed. Tilda Swinton plays an excellent and very cold White Witch--she was indeed convincing. Her portrayal of Jadis is very well-done. The scenery, the magical creatures--just stupendous. People are calling this a miniature Lord of the Rings. Well of course--C.S. Lewis and J.R.R Tolkien were friends, so it would make sense. I have already said all I could say about this wonderful film. Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful =) 8.8/10 Stars",9,5,7,8 December 2005
Madagascar," So Much Could Have Happened on This Island...
","Okay. Here we go. Before watching this film, if you read what it is going to be about, you will find something that could be promising. Four animals that are close friends in a zoo end up being stranded in the wild where one of them--the lion--finds out that it is his nature to hunt down the other three. Now that makes a good story! But the thing is that the story barely even touched on that. It seemed to go nowhere and throughout the time that I watched this, I felt as if it were still beginning and we were being introduced to the characters, including the ones that later come into play. I didn't feel as if the peak of the plot was ever reached because I started thinking: What is the plot? Where is this movie trying to go? Nothing really happens. This film is like a large introduction that never really goes anywhere. It barely touches the middle of the story when it suddenly ends. A big hole was certainly there when the credits came up. A lot could have been done with this story. We also never really connect with any of the characters. They are just there. The voices are done well and they really match with the characters, but that's mostly it. There is not a lot of character development. But the good news is that many kids will enjoy this. There is plenty of light humor, especially with the penguins who steal the show most of the time. There are cute parts and the visuals are all right. This is no Shrek and it is a little below Shark Tale in my opinion. Dreamworks could have had a much better film. So much more could have happened on this island, but alas we were only introduced to it and nothing else. No, this movie is not horribly bad, but it is not very good either. I give it an average at best. It is watchable but that is it for me. The story was handled too weakly. This movie really had potential. But hey, at least the kids most likely will enjoy it =)5.8/10 Stars",6,98,168,1 June 2005
Constantine," Hell Wants Him, Earth Needs Him, Film Lacked Him
","Heaven won't take Constantine. WE should take the movie though and leave the lame ones of this genre behind. Many films having to do with supernatural forces, demons, angels, the occult, etc all attempt to be something original and interesting but fail. Some examples include Lost Souls and the prequel to the Exorcist. But this movie gives us something a little different. It has a good concept--a doomed man exorcising demons on earth to get his way into heaven. That is only a tad of the story--there is more to it that kept me quite entertained and waiting to see what would happen next. It is not only brainless action and special effects. I was actually afraid that it would be that way and that the story would be weak. There is a story and it follows through a bit smoothly. There are only a few dull moments where I lost track of what was being said because the dialogue was much too prolonged. But other than that I will say that they did a fair job with this one. It is not awesomely great either; it had its flaws. There are some instances in the movie that was unnecessary and if they were taken in another direction, this would have been better. But as I said before--compared to the other films of this genre--this is one of the better ones fortunately. It has a dark and ominous atmosphere and it puts you through each plane in the film--Hell, Earth, and Heaven. The visuals were very well done for all three of them and transitions through them were good. Added on to that, Constantine is actually an interesting and cool character to put in a movie like this. Hell wants him, Earth needs him, but Film lacked him; and by that I mean that many movies in this category lacked an attention-grabbing lead character...and story for that matter. This one succeeds in those two departments. So if you are a fan of this movie and were able to sit through the mediocre End of Days, then you will like this one. It is one of the better movies of the year so far =) 6.8/10 Stars",7,3,19,20 February 2005
The Polar Express," Great meaning
","Let me start off by saying that I loved the book ever since I was younger. I have always thought that it carried a beautiful meaning that needed to be shown in the movie in order for it to be considered The Polar Express. The movie is wonderfully done and quite enjoyable. Of course the visuals were purely amazing and just breathtaking. That was plainly obvious. And I know that additions needed to be made so that this could be made into a movie, but some of them were unnecessary, and I was waiting for those scenes to be over so that the good parts would be shown. Then again, I knew what was going to happen. But judging as a movie, it was great overall. It is not only about Christmas, but about the things in front of us that we choose not to see. The film is great for children as well as adults who carry the Christmas spirit in their hearts =)",7,2,5,6 November 2004
Corpse Bride," Burton Reanimates His Style
","This was overall a beautiful film. I happened to enjoy the Nightmare Before Christmas, and I had a feeling that this would be just as good. I was not wrong. Yes, you could see the reflections of many of the characters from NBC in this one, but I did not mind that. This was still a movie on its own. The music was fantastic, the animation was splendid, and the visuals were marvelous. I do not believe that a fan of Burton will be disappointed with this one. I like how we come to care about the characters and actually feel what they are going through just by looking at their facial expressions. That surely is quality. There are so many scenes in this movie that are extremely beautiful, one being a piano-playing scene between the main character and the Corpse Bride. There are a lot of symbolic features, which is of course typical of Burton to do, and that is one of the reasons that he is a great director. I have said so many good things about this movie, so now let us move on to the negatives. A lot of people will want to expect something new from Burton, which they will not get here, but I did not seem to have a problem with it. What I do think is that there could have been a little bit more development with the characters and a few of the scenes, but I did take into consideration that this type of animation is extremely hard work. The movie was still very well done, and I do not have many complaints about it. I think kids will like this, especially since there are enough funny moments, and older people will enjoy the movie as well, most likely for its beauty and 'cuteness' it has to it. Burton reanimates his style through this one. That is why I think that his fans should not have a problem with this Corpse Bride =) 8/10 Stars",8,4,8,23 September 2005
Batman Begins," 'Batman' Begins the List of Top 2005 Films
","What an excellent movie. I actually saw this twice in the same day and that was because I went to take someone else to see it after I already saw it. Now this had all the signs of a good movie--excellent director, magnificent casting, very good actors, and the anticipation of a plot. And this movie had its plot--something many of this year's movies were lacking. This Batman outdoes all the other Batmans made and Bale does such a good job that he finally cleared Keaton of the 'Batman' name. I did not think Bale could pull it off, but I was proved wrong. Everyone else was good for their parts and I must give my credits to my favorite DC villain--the Scarecrow. Murphy couldn't have done better. From the moment we see him, we know he's crazy as he should be. This movie had just about everything--enough action (not overly done where one gets tired of it), enough dialogue (not the type that makes a movie drag), good cinematography and scenery, and much more. You thirst for more when it ends. If you appreciate good movies with a real story and not just mindless action, you must see this one. Now I usually say the goods and bads of a movie. I suppose the downsides would be: not more screening time for the Scarecrow or Watanabe (who is an excellent actor), Holmes' acting, and the fact that I'm going to have to wait a while to buy this on DVD. Everything else is true. The statement that there are too many Batman movies must be dismissed--this it the REAL Batman movie. If you are a true fan, see this now. This is definitely up there with Spider-man. Don't let the trailers fool you if you didn't find them appealing. Like I said, if you appreciate a real and good movie, you'll be missing out if you don't see this =) 9.5/10 Stars",10,1,2,22 June 2005
The Incredibles," The word 'Incredible' is an understatement
","My, my. This movie was just amazing, incredible, astounding, magnificent. No matter what synonym for 'incredible' I look for, it ends up being an understatement for this phenomenon of a movie. Pixar seriously cannot fail. Never before have I seen a company on a winning streak such as this. The film had just about everything from an excellent storyline to supercool powers. It allows time for each superhero to shine and show off their abilities. It gives us what we want to see. The parallelism between being heroes and a family was simply just outstanding, beautiful. It is so wonderful how these writers can mix in family theme with the ever-so-popular superhero theme. One sits there being able to relate to one's own family. Of course it has cool visuals and effects. Many times I found myself forgetting that this was animated. There is nothing negative I can say about this film, and usually I can pinpoint the little things. If you are looking for another excellent and fun Pixar film for the entire family, see this after reading this review. I know that I will not have any doubts when they release their next incredible picture =)",10,1,2,6 November 2004
Saw II," I'm Glad I SAW This Too
","I will begin this review by saying that I absolutely enjoyed Saw part one. I was surprised that it would be so different than the average horror/gore flick. I believe that it is the best movie of its kind in a long time. Now here is the sequel. If you know nothing of the first Saw or did not understand it, you will be confused, perhaps lost, and find this movie bizarre and maybe even dumb. But it is as genius as the first one. When the movie starts, we already know that we are in for something different than the first. It has a distinct feel and seems like a typical horror movie at the beginning. But as it goes along, the Saw feel returns and the tension begins. I cannot describe any more about the movie here without spoiling anything. The Jigsaw killer is awesome, his games are sick and twisted, and this movie is excellent. Forget what the critics say. I have come to realize that they cannot appreciate a movie like this for what it is. Look at their reviews for this and you will see what I mean. I mainly take into consideration how the screenwriter is a new guy (only other movie is Saw one) and he managed to come together with two first-time directors and produce a very different and interesting movie. Many experienced writers/directors cannot even do that. As the Jigsaw killer says: yes, there is blood here, and a lot of it. If you could not handle the first Saw, I do not know how your tolerance level will be here. There are a lot of moments of disgust. But if you enjoyed the first Saw, you will either find this too weird or outstanding. There is a lot of information about Jigsaw that gives us more of an understanding of who he is and how twisted his mind is. There are so many instances in which we even want to agree with him. I find that to be good writing on a character's part, and surprising to most, there are a lot of symbolic images here that involve the clock and the jigsaw piece that the killer takes from his subjects' skin. I'm glad I SAW this too along with the first one. It certainly lives up its predecessor (and most sequels do not), and I was afraid it would not. Go see this for yourself, especially if you liked the twistedness of the first Saw =) 8.2/10 Stars",8,0,2,1 November 2005
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," The Trip to the Chocolate Factory
","The original movie was good. If you have seen it, picture that with even more detail and background. That is close to what this film is. Tim Burton did a very good job with this and took us around the Factory while providing more insight than the first movie did. There is no better and worse here because they are both very good. This was a well-done movie. I enjoyed it and was glad that I saw an advanced screening to it. It was warm, charming, and fun. Depp did a superb, outstanding job as Willy Wonka. I know that many doubted that he would be able to do the job, but think about how long of a way he's come. He is a very good actor, and he proved so more here. I totally forgot that it was Depp playing the character. All I saw was Willy Wonka. He was just that convincing. If you want to see this movie but are worried about how Depp will do, relax now and go watch it because you will most likely not be disappointed. The movie is good and touching at some points, giving some details to Wonka's past, which is not emphasized in the original version. This lets you see who Willy Wonka actually is and why he is the way he is. There is a lot of symbolism, which is one of the movie's strong points. I like how there is a reason for everything and everyone. And in conclusion, the trip to the Chocolate Factory was a great and interesting one. The children will enjoy it especially with the many funny parts and everyone else will like it because it's entertaining. The worse thing I can mention about this is the way the songs were done by the Oompa Loompas. But they were still all right. They were passable. The great and artistic Burton did an overall good job with this film =)7.5/10 Stars",8,7,12,15 July 2005
Saw," I am glad I SAW!!
","This is one amazing movie! I usually despise all those lame, laughable movies people call horror. Here are a list of the lame: Darkness Falls, Signs, Dracula 2000, House of 1000 Corpses, etc. I could go on and on. This took the 'who did it' category and twisted it into this incredible and disturbing film. It was VERY well done. It gets one psychologically, and just when you think you have everything summed up, something else ends up happening. It is twist after twist after twist. I usually predict these things well, and I believed I had this movie down from the beginning. Haha. I ended up clapping at the end and saying, 'Very nice!' This movie probably has the best ending in a horror movie I have ever seen. Yes, I loved this film, and I am very glad I SAW it. My only complaint is the mediocre acting by Elwes, but even that is nothing compared to the rest that this film has to offer. As far as gore goes, there really is not that much at all. There is little blood, but a lot of violent and gruesome images. If you're a big time horror or suspense/mystery fan for that matter, this will not disappoint you. The movie was as genius as the Jigsaw killer =)",10,0,0,31 October 2004
The Last Samurai," Absolutely, positively, NO doubt WHATSOEVER...BEST movie of 2003!
","I have seen many Kurosawa films, and have loved them all. That is why I did not have many high expectations for this movie, as I usually do not have for any. I had many doubts about it, especially with Tom Cruise playing a samurai...come on now. I had a feeling it was going to be good, but not this OUTSTANDING. It was the most powerful movie I have seen in 2003 and in a long time. The direction, music, and acting were awesome. It puts you in the world of the Samurai and Feudal Japan, especially with the accompaniment of Hans Zimmer's BEAUTIFUL score. You know a movie is good when the music keeps playing in your head and the images from it keep flashing back. I have no idea how it could have gotten a 7.9 average from the reviews when it should be up in the top 50. I noticed that the lower grades are from people who mostly hate Cruise, which is pathetic. This movie deserved the Best Picture Oscar, and I have no idea how it was not even nominated. Seabiscuit?? Come on!People actually clapped at the end of the movie, and that is a rarity. Everything about this movie was amazing, and each scene worth-watching. If you like Braveheart and Dances With Wolves, you will surely enjoy this. This definitely deserves an A in my book. If you have better feelings about the movie after reading this, I advise you to get the DVD and watch it over and over. Absolutely, positively, no doubt whatsoever the best movie of 2003 =)",10,1,3,8 October 2004
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," These two killers missed the target
","Eh. This movie was just okay. One could easily tell that it was made for mainly eye candy--to show two supposed 'pretty' faces. Pitt, according to many is one of the hottest male actors (nothing special about him in my opinion); and Jolie, also according to many is one of the hottest female actors (she's more elegant than she is pretty). Now put these two together in an action flick and you have something that people want to see--no matter how unrealistic or dull it is. This had a pretty good plot and it could have been taken further, but as I said, the two main actors were more concentrated on. I did not feel them as assassins. I did not feel them as married. I did not get much from this movie. It was all right until the end of the middle, and then from there it got dull and I was hoping for it to end soon. I just did not care about what happened to these two. But I'll stop saying the negatives about this and go on to the positives. There were some funny parts like the battles that Mr. and Mrs. Smith have. I like how they are married without knowing who each other really is and that their marriage is falling apart particularly because of that. I would go on and say what else I liked, but I don't want to spoil it for anyone. It is also humorous when the couple is trying to kill each other. Other than that, I did not care for this movie. These two killers missed the target. But, nevertheless, this drew in a large audience and many of you will enjoy it especially if you like Pitt and/or Jolie. I suppose that's it =) 5.9/10 Stars",6,8,16,28 June 2005
Wedding Crashers," Entertaining, But Then It Crashes Toward the End
","Wedding Crashers...a very funny film that just could have been better. I'm not a big comedy fan. I only saw this because I was able to see it for free. It has two good and pretty funny actors in it, and I will say they did very well together. The story of two guys crashing weddings for the free food, drinks, and girls--one of them ends up falling for a political figure's daughter and the other strangely falls for the sister. This seems like a pretty good story for a romantic comedy. And it is for a while. The whole movie provides the audience with laughter, which of course was a very good thing. It was the relieving factor here. I just did not like how I did not care about what happened to any of the characters, especially during the middle half. They made pretty messed up decisions and I was beginning to get tired. But I'm sure not many people are going to care about that. This is a comedy, not a drama. It is supposed to be fun and it is. I guess it just becomes a little too drab, and I just did not care how it finished. A lot of you will like this though. The movie is entertaining for a while, but as I said before, it then crashes toward the end. And if you are concerned with sexual content, there is plenty of it mainly in the dialogue and brief nudity. That is about it. If you are a fan of comedies or any of the actors, you will have a good time with these crashers =) 6.2/10 Stars",6,0,3,19 July 2005
Fantastic Four," Wow...'Fantastic' is just not the adjective
","Oh boy. Where do I even start? I'm not going to hate on this film. I'm only going to provide an honest review. Here we go. In a nutshell, this is an entertaining movie. It's a FUN movie. With that said, this will please more kids than anything. Teenage boys will like it for Alba (sigh), kids will like it because it's funny and fun, and everyone else might either hate it or find it at least entertaining. I fit in with everyone else. This movie was OKAY at best. I've never read the comic books, but I know enough about the Fantastic Four to say that not much justice was done to them. Reed Richards was mediocre, Sue Storm was not convincing as a character, Johnny Storm was either irritating or funny (at least true to his character), and The Thing was the one that very convincing and the only one I remotely cared for. Maybe it's because of the casting? I did not feel this to be the Fantastic Four at all. It felt more like a comedy. If it were, it would be a good one. But come on! This is the FF4! Why not be like how Spider-Man was and show us who they are? This could have been an excellent movie. But Doctor Doom, my all-time favorite Marvel villain (and perhaps the best villain) was done NO justice whatsoever. Okay, so McMahon is a decent actor. He did what he could. But there is no Victor von Doom here. Suddenly in this movie he's a comedian. Making lame jokes? Come on, that's not Doom! Perhaps there is too much Victor and not an ounce of Doom. Okay, I got that out of the way. Now let us move on to Alba as Sue Storm, which was obviously done for eye candy and eye candy only. I wanted to see her as Sue and not as Alba. With her acting skills and the bad script, Sue Storm surely seems to be invisible. I wanted this to be good, but alas this is the movie. The special effects are pretty good. The only battle scene left me saying, 'What? That's all? That's the climax battle?' It was that unsatisfying. There really is no story here and I don't know what else to say except that it was just okay. No depth and there is almost no reason for anything that happens in this film. Maybe because Tim Story should not have directed it? I don't know, but 'Fantastic' is just not the adjective to describe this movie. It was what it COULD HAVE been, but sadly it was not. But as I said before, there is a high chance that the kids will like it, especially since it is entertaining at best =)5.7/10 Stars",6,2,5,10 July 2005
Sin City," One of the Sins of this film is that it ended
","Whew. Finally a memorable movie this year. It is a different movie, a stylish movie. I really love the fact that it is in black-and-white with bits of color. It really reinforces scenes, detail, and meaning. The direction was marvelous as were the visuals. The acting was good and the characters were convincing. I followed through this film and it was one heck of a ride. Let me say this though: I have not read the comics. It was probably why I did not care to see this film even after the second trailer. But after reading up on it and finding out some details about the film and comics, I ended up thinking that I should give this a shot. Heck, the black-and-white gave me more of a reason. I already knew the direction and cinematography were going to be amazing. I was not wrong. This modern film noir is very entertaining to watch and the jazz music sets the mood and tone just right. People will say that there are no characters with heart in this movie, but I will have to disagree. Yes, everyone is corrupt (maybe with the exception of Nancy). Yes, nearly everyone kills someone. But we actually get a sense of these characters and root for the 'good' ones--the heroes--to get what they want. That is what a good movie is about. Having not read the book, this must have been one great adaptation because everything went smoothly and I did not get confused and I was not full of questions. The three stories are intermingled and they do connect somehow, and I thought that was interesting. Everyone is basically a strong character in his/her own way, and that is one strength of this movie. Enough praises though. I am sure that you have read all the praises possible for this. I will go on to the few negatives now. Sometimes you will be able to tell that the background was generated and lose the authenticity of the setting. You start to remember that this was all done on green screen. Some other slight flaws are too insignificant to mention here. One of the Sins of this movie is that it ended. Yes, even with the few 'bad' features this movie has, you bypass them and enjoy watching. When it was about five minutes toward the end, I actually wanted it to keep going. But hey, I was satisfied. To end off, I want to say that YES, this film is extremely violent and disturbing with characters killed and tortured in almost every way possible. So if you could not handle something like Kill Bill or Pulp Fiction, you will not be able to endure this one. But if you liked the above movies, you will be able to endure and enjoy this one =) 7.9/10 Stars",8,1,2,2 April 2005
