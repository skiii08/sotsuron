The Blair Witch Project," Am I just jaded?
","It simply wasn't shocking, frightening or scary.  It just wasn't.  Yes, it was quirky... yes, it was original... but this is simply a student film, a good student film, but in no way is this a movie that I should have paid money to see.  I feel cheated by undue hype. I did not see this film in an art house and the patrons where I viewed the film were overwhelmingly disappointed.  Uninteresting photography, if that's what you can call it, dizzying in its shakiness, awkward in its jumping from video to 16mm, predictable, tiresome in its dialog.... Still, I liked the idea but sorry, there are lot's of good ideas that fail in their execution, this failed for me.  I have to wonder, how, after having seen thousands of films over the years, can my opinion be so diametrically opposed to the current general praise this film has generated?  Or is it simply a cry for something different from Hollywood.... but surely protest doesn't make this film more than a good student film?",1,0,2,1 August 1999
