The Blair Witch Project," So boring I wanted my money back
","I saw this movie in the theaters when it came out. There was nothing terrifying or suspenseful about it to me, and I am someone who likes genuinely suspenseful movies. (Note: I do not like the gratuitous fake-blood-using horror flicks that just come off as laughable, but rather truly suspenseful films that keep you hooked and feeling 'freaked out' and guessing throughout the film.) This movie promised to be a classic suspense film, not a bloody horror show, but it was actually neither. The only suspense in it was waiting for something interesting to happen. By the time the ending credits rolled, I realized nothing interesting would happen. My husband and I both looked at each other and said, 'This is it?' If you want a more mind-bending, suspense thriller, I suggest Identity, starring John Cusack or any classic Hitchcock thriller. Even at his worst, Hitchcock had great cinematography and an artistry to his work unparalleled by the likes of Blair Witch.",1,3,6,26 October 2009
