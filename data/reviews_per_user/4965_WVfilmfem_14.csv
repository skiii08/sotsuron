Ford v Ferrari," Thoroughly enjoyable without political correctness
","I love racing history, the old races, the grit of the track. This film exceeded my expectations, since most productions coming out of Hollywood have to add the political correctness aspects. Thankful for a straight-up story of racing history without the in your face propaganda. Excellent film, highly recommended.",10,4,7,3 December 2019
It," Sick, stupid, evil, and boring
",Just a very boring foray via another Stephen King ripoff. Certainly not appropriate for the age for which it is intended.,1,1,6,28 October 2018
Last Flag Flying," You know what it will portend by the actors involved
","It's basically an anti-American vehicle for the big bad American military. Sympathetic character development for three former Vietnam vets en route to bury a fallen son. The events that transpire are pretentiously ridiculous, painting the means of burying a fallen soldier as conspiratorial on the part of the military. One could expect no less when you have the likes of Bryan Cranston in one of the lead roles. It's all part of Hollywood's war on American values.",3,7,14,14 May 2018
The Irishman," Excellent
","Especially in the end, in which we all are finite, alone. Even an 'enforcer' finds himself wanting absolution amidst physical deterioration, despite lack of remorse. A brave expose.",9,5,12,29 November 2019
Shutter Island," View more than once
","Having read the book, and initially watched once, I can say that multiple viewings of this film reveals new subtle facets each time. Performances are superb. The only thing I noticed, and which have should have been corrected was DiCaprio's annoying mispronunciation of 'escape'....saying 'eXscape' several times! A minor thing, but such a brilliant actor should know better!",Null,0,1,26 October 2017
The Lost City of Z," Raleigh Rimmel?
","I was SO looking forward to this movie. Why, oh, why, was Raleigh Rimmel excluded from the story. His presence in the last expedition was important, his friendship with Jack, his suffering, which ultimately contributed to the failure of the expedition. Having read David Grann's book, and then 'Exploration Fawcett,' I was expecting a more accurate portrayal of the final trip. Beautifully filmed, still a disappointment.",3,1,2,14 July 2017
Bohemian Rhapsody," Not that impressive
","Rami is an excellent actor, but casting him in this role lacked the physical prowess of Freddie. Also, the teeth prosthetic seemed to disturb Rami's speech, much mumbling. A lot of the rave reviews here seem to be based on sentimentality rather than objective criticism.",4,21,31,10 November 2018
Bird Box," Aggravating, pointless, preposterous
","In all, not very engaging as a story. The idea of journey as blindfolded with two small blindfolded children is not compelling or thriller; it's anxiety-producing. Especially since the protagonist (Bullock) is basically unlikable in this role. The whole premise is preposterous: traveling in a boat blindfolded, driving a car blind, etc. Also, there's an element of child abuse with 'boy' and 'girl' who've spent their little lives with the Bullock character as non-entities, until the ending in which there is supposed to be some sort of validation of their presence.
I realize this is based on the book, which came out before A Quiet Place, but the similarities are undeniable, and one can't help but compare the two films. There were inadequacies in A Quiet Place as well, but it was a much more compelling film than Bird Box.",1,78,165,22 December 2018
The Favourite," 'two hours of ugliness'
","As someone else stated, this is two hours of ugliness, or of people behaving in ugly ways, with no redeeming qualities. No likable characters therein. Two hours of scenarios that are beyond distasteful. NOT a comedy.",1,62,114,6 January 2019
Uri: The Surgical Strike," I watched it for Mohit Raina
","...who is gorgeous, and who has magnificent screen presence. The story and action are good, btw. Very inspiring story, though, for sure the Paki's don't like it!",10,1,2,29 March 2019
Mother!," Bad dream
","After watching this, and being very frustrated at the illogical actions of the protagonists, I was left perplexed. Afterward, reliving the scenes in my mind, I realized this film is very much like dreams, in which things happen for no apparent logical reason. The film requires a lot of the viewer,maybe not worth it in the end, but definitely dream scenarios, more than reality. I'll admit, I didn't understand the final scene.",5,7,14,6 October 2017
Creed II," What are all the fuss big ratings about
","This film was just a remaking of other Rocky films, especially Creed 1. Not engaging at all, imho.",2,26,46,18 December 2018
Green Book," Sweet, really
","Finally choosing to watch this film, I expected the typical race-baiting Hollywood genre. It is not. It is a story of an exceptional talent and a metamorphosis in attitude of the character portrayed by Viggio Mortenson.
Very well done and well worth the time to watch. I feel emotionally enriched from having viewed it.",10,0,2,5 July 2019
The Great Gatsby," Shallow debutante won by materialism
","The visuals are impressive. But the story is vacuous. There is no reason for Daisy to have been the object of such devotion and 'love' other than her looks and place in society. So...poor Gatsby aspires to win her back by acquiring wealth and squandering it to gain her attention. All the characters are shallow and unlikable. Probably the reason for the book's success and lasting popularity is F. Scott Fitzgerald's eloquent writing, despite the lack of depth.",1,2,3,11 December 2019
