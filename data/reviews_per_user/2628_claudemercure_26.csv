Requiem for a Dream," a heartbreaking nightmare
","What this movie has to say about drug addiction may not be original, but it more than makes up for that with the sheer vividness and emotional force with which it delivers its message. Among other achievements, Aronofsky does a great job of reimagining daytime TV as hell (though admittedly it's not much of a stretch) and fictional TV personality Tappy Tibbons as the prince of darkness. He is aided and abetted in the realization of his vision by cinematographer Matthew Libatique. The soundtrack by Clint Mansell is also extraordinary.The key to the film's impact is that it gets you to care about its characters before it puts them through hell. Ellen Burstyn totally disappears into her role; she was robbed of an Oscar for her fearlessly real performance, the best one by any actor in 2000. Just watch her do her speech to her son mid-way through about the things that give meaning to her life, and try to prevent your heart from breaking. A wrenching and haunting nightmare.",9,0,2,28 August 2002
The Big Lebowski," Mess, featuring tasty bits
","What probably happened was, the Coen brothers had a bunch of cool visual and story ideas they didn't know what to do with, and they decided to make a movie out of these disparate elements. The result is a bit of a mess. You can just hear the Coens saying, 'Hey, what if there was this guy who's the ultimate slacker? And what if there were these guys who thought they were nihilists but were just a bunch of pathetic poseurs with exaggerated German accents who played geeky German electronic music on a puny ghetto blaster? What if-' - by this point they're already laughing themselves silly, and they're right: this stuff is very funny. But it doesn't add up to anything.This is easily their most disjointed film (their only disjointed film, actually), and their least involving. But it's worth seeing once, if only for the wonderfully conceived central character (Jeff Bridges in a pitch-perfect performance); for Steve Buscemi's skillful, subtly hilarious puppy-dog performance; and for moments such as the narrator saying near film's end that 'it's good to know the Dude's out there', a statement made humorous by the fact that the main character couldn't be less of a hero.",7,1,3,23 August 2002
Inglourious Basterds," lesser QT is still great entertainment
","In Nazi-occupied France, a group of soldiers make it their mission to kill Nazis. Meanwhile, a Jewish-French cinema owner concocts a plan of revenge.Writer-director Quentin Tarantino sticks to his usual combo of gore, humour, clever dialogue, and grace notes of actual human emotion. But he departs from it by employing a linear narrative structure. Also, for the first time, he doesn't seem to be paying homage to a particular film genre. And though the dialogue stands out, it's considerably less showy than it's been in his previous films. The speeches don't sound so much like speeches.There are many scenes of expertly orchestrated tension, and the movie is juicy entertainment (thanks in part to Christoph Waltz's nuanced, committed performance as the main villain). But in the end, there is a sense that this was much ado about very little, which means the movie will probably have low repeatability value. All of Tarantino's movies are cartoonish on some level, but in this case his touch may have been too light to give Basterds longevity.",8,1,6,1 September 2009
Forrest Gump," entertaining but shallow
","Entertaining comedy/drama/fantasy has a lot to keep you busy (and excellent special effects), but doesn't measure up to its epic pretensions. It would've benefited from sticking to comedy and eschewing sentiment. Instead it pushes every button imaginable to jerk a reaction out of the viewer, and tries to dictate your emotions with a pushy music score. The movie lapses into silliness at times, and is self-indulgent for the last hour. Director Robert Zemeckis attempts to evoke each era by illustrating its clichÃ©s and by scoring it to a procession of over-familiar songs that serve as lazy, embarrassingly obvious signifiers of their times (Sweet Home Alabama, Hound Dog, Blowin' in the Wind, California Dreamin', For What it's Worth, On the Road Again, Mrs. Robinson, etc.). I love a lot of those songs, but they've become clichÃ©s themselves by now. Tom Hanks is funny and convincing in the title role, but Forrest is too much of an invincible saint to be very interesting.",7,3,8,25 December 2010
Watchmen," the best they could do with a hard-to-adapt book
","In an alternate version of the mid-eighties where Nixon is serving a third term, costumed heroes are outlawed, but they must unite to fight an oncoming threat. That's a shabby outline, but it's hard to summarize this plot. I read the comic book this is based on, and the adaptation turned out pretty much exactly as I expected: faithful but lacking most of the book's more subtle shadings.Watchmen is one of those things people have long said couldn't be filmed. They were wrong, and this is about as good a job as anyone could be expected to do. But it still left me unsatisfied. It's certainly entertaining, and the movie gets the characters right (especially my favourite, Rorschach, thanks in large part to actor Jackie Earle Haley). The book is dark, moody, and ambiguous whereas this is a loud and boisterous action film. One of the main problems is that it makes every character 'cool', which takes away some of the depth found in the book. It also fails to provide a proper build-up to the reveal of the 'villain''s plan (which has been changed from the book to something rather mundane). And the fight scenes are generically shot. Director Zack Snyder really needs to lose his distracting affectation of switching from slow motion to regular speed.",7,1,5,8 March 2009
The Shining," disappointing adaptation shows flashes of brilliance
","Uninvolving, sometimes chilling horror film has some shocks, and some powerful, unsettling images and sequences.The book this is based on is one of my favourites, but my problem with this adaptation isn't that it isn't faithful enough. Rather, it's the fact that the relationships are not believable, the script is awkward, and the dialogue trite.Expressionless Shelley Duvall is a terrible actress and Jack Nicholson is badly cast (he fails to play a regular guy, which is what's needed at the beginning of the film). Danny Lloyd does a great job, however.The build-up to the climax is inadequate (though the ending does have some suspense). It looks as though Kubrick could have done something great with this, but he never gets a complete handle on the genre.",7,0,3,12 April 2010
American Beauty," a wee bit overrated
","Director Sam Mendes proves a great showman, but his film fails when it tries to pass itself off as some deep philosophical commentary on suburban life. Since the movie makes most of its points as a cartoon, it's a bit much when it asks us to buy its adult characters as human beings (this makes the film's motto, 'look closer' ironic, since it doesn't bear close scrutiny).I'd pin the blame for this fatal flaw on Alan Ball, whose screenplay, despite capturing many truthful moments, hobbles everyone involved by being more interested in hollow sensationalism than real emotions (the ending being a good example).Still, the movie excels as a beautifully shot, very entertaining black comedy.",8,1,2,22 April 2005
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," the first good Harry Potter film
","Harry finds out a maniac has escaped the wizard prison Azkaban, bent on killing him.A darker, fast-moving installment. The reins are finally given to a real director, and the results are a dramatic improvement. Alfonso Cuaron gives the film an appealing visual style, brings the characters down to earth (with the help of the costume department – the clothes now look like they've actually been worn), while making the film's fantastical elements (the Dementors, the Whomping Willow) feel at once more real and truly magical.It also helps that the young actors have matured to a level where they've actually begun acting. The only real flaw is that by accentuating the sense of fun, the film ends up feeling a bit slight.",8,0,1,12 June 2013
No Country for Old Men," mature
","What do you know - the Coen brothers done grown up. Don't get me wrong: I've always been a fan. But I can't deny that in every movie up til now, they seemed to be winking at the audience. Not this time. In case you don't already know, this one is about a guy who finds a case full of money, and the guy who comes after him.That's the plot, anyway; anyone expecting a conventional thriller will be disappointed. The movie is certainly very suspenseful, but if you're the type that needs narrative closure, this one isn't for you. The movie took me by surprise in its last act, when it sheds its thriller trappings to leave you gazing at what's been underneath them all along. I need to have another look to fully grasp what that is.The only false note for me was Woody Harrelson's character. You could surgically remove him from the film, and you wouldn't be missing anything. I suspect the character played a more crucial part in the book, but he's kind of useless here.Javier Bardem scared the crap out of me. And not just because of that haircut.",9,1,7,23 November 2007
The Mist," excellent horror film marred by misguided ending
","Stephen King hasn't had much luck at the movies. I think the main reason is that the movie people usually get distracted by the flashy scary stuff in his stories, and entirely miss the careful characterization that makes readers care about what happens.They didn't forget about it this time, though. I wouldn't call myself a Frank Darabont fan (director of two other King-based films – Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile). The first two times, he took solid stories and rendered them mushy and cliché-ridden (I realize I won't make a lot of friends around these parts with that statement). The Mist isn't perfect, but it doesn't suffer from those flaws. For most of its running time, it's an excellent horror movie – intense, and grounded by realistic performances and dialogue. (Plus some cool creatures.) But it does stumble at least twice. The first time occurs when a bunch of characters have a conversation the purpose of which is to tell the audience about the movie's subtext. Thanks, Frank. I mean, we are idiots, after all.But the biggest problem is the misguided ending (what follows discusses tone but doesn't spoil specific plot points). I don't care that Darabont deviated from the original story (I'm not a stickler for 'faithfulness'), but what he comes up with fails on multiple levels. The final moment of Twilight Zone-style heavy-handed irony is bad enough. But just before that, Darabont gives us a scenario that strains credibility so badly (the level of the characters' despair does not remotely justify their actions) that it becomes obvious it was contrived purely for shock value. Adding insult to injury, he seems to think he can pass off his cheap shock ending as something deep simply by slathering Dead Can Dance's portentous 'The Host of Seraphim' all over the tail end of the soundtrack (it's a great tune, but out of place here). Instead, it only serves to expose the pretensions of someone who would try to infuse a giant-bug movie with unearned depth.So, this is a very good scary movie... if you tune out in time.",8,4,11,6 April 2008
I Am Legend," grown-up movie
","It appears that in the last few years, Will Smith has grown up. It's done wonders for his acting. There are a few moments of levity in I Am Legend, but nothing like the non-stop stream of bad jokes that helped make Independence Day so atrocious. Mr. Smith has learned to bring gravity and vulnerability to a role when it is required. He expresses several states of mind here with skill.But I think big-budget action/science-fiction movies have grown up too. After all, Will didn't write his own quips in his previous blockbuster movies, and his directors likely encouraged him to ham it up. The nineties are rife with movies that don't respect their audience's intelligence. The Fifth Element, Alien Resurrection, The Rock, and Armageddon are a few others which spring to mind, movies that undercut their own suspense by drowning it with idiotic jokes.Anyway, this movie is an example of the darker breed of sci-fi film that has emerged since. Most of humanity has been wiped out. All that seems to be left is Will Smith, and some scary humanoid creatures. The post-apocalyptic world is vividly realized (there are weeds growing through cracks in the middle of downtown New York streets), and it truly feels like Smith is the last man on Earth. The scenes of suspense are intense. If you enjoy science fiction tinged with horror, I recommend this.",8,1,3,15 December 2007
Moulin Rouge!," overrated but not bad
","Favourable reaction to this movie is a good example of a common problem - audiences rewarding something because it's different, regardless of whether it's actually good.Luhrman has good intentions, but he sabotages his own movies by overloading the viewer's senses.The idea to make a period musical where the actors sing contemporary pop songs has great potential, but the storyline is incredibly simplistic, and Luhrmann seems completely incapable of dealing in genuine human emotions, which makes for a hollow movie-going experience.Still, there are a few inspired moments (the movie's high point is the 'Roxanne' number near the end, one of the only times the movie has any emotional power).",7,4,7,22 April 2005
Mulholland Drive," dream logic
","Where to start.I think I've seen it five times now, and I can't get enough of it. It somehow demands to be seen again, and I can't put my finger on why. So I'll stick to telling you what I know.Things I love about Mulholland Drive: 1) The way it looks. It's one of the best-shot films I've seen in several years. I can't remember seeing such seductively vivid colours in a movie, and the camera work contributes a great deal to the ominous mood (kudos to Peter Deming).2) Angelo Badalamenti's invaluable music, which comes out dark whether it's foreboding or up tempo.3) Naomi Watts, who apparently wholly embraced Lynch's vision and came up with a great, nuanced interpretation of her character.4) Justin Theroux's witty performance. He seemed to be on the same wavelength as Lynch, and he really inhabits his character.5) Finally, what makes Mulholland Drive the experience that it is, is that it casts a spell. There's no better way to put it, but this is what David Lynch does when he's at his best (Eraserhead, The Elephant Man, Blue Velvet, the Twin Peaks episodes he directed). He creates moments that can only be described as film poetry. Moments he imbues with a mysterious, unexplainable power, such as a man in a diner describing a nightmare he had; Betty's audition scene; the moment when Betty and Adam's eyes lock on the movie set; or Betty and Rita's oddly emotional experience in the club Silencio.All that being said, I could have lived without Mr. Roque and the Cowboy, characters probably meant to add to the film's mood of mystery, whose too-obvious oddness instead ends up disrupting said mood.",8,0,3,27 August 2002
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," skillful adaptation
","This is a first: a Harry Potter movie that bests its source. The first, second, and fourth movies were okay at best, and the third one was as good as the book. But book 5 is the weakest of the bunch, and the filmmakers have done what I was hoping they would do - distill it. In the book, Harry's life reaches new levels of miserableness, and he turns into an irritating teenager. Making matters worse for the reader is the fact that the book sorely needs editing; it takes forever to get to Hogwarts. The book is filled with so much unpleasantness that it's a chore to trudge through. Plus, it introduces the series' most annoyingly cutesy secondary character, Tonks.The movie fixes all that. It looks great and is fast-paced, breezing through the opening pre-school scenes; Harry remains testy, but not overwhelmingly so; and Tonks is now a fun addition. The film also makes the Dumbledore's Army scenes more dynamic and retains the essence of two great new characters, spacey Luna Lovegood and insidious evil incarnate Dolores Umbridge. At the same time, this one suffers from an ailment that plagued its predecessors as well: in attempting to stuff the plot into a 140-minute movie, some depth is inevitably lost. Books 4 to 7 all need to be three-hour epics.",8,1,2,6 April 2008
Grindhouse," get ready to overdose on fun
","Planet Terror, the first segment of Grindhouse, is without a doubt the goriest thing I've ever seen. I also can't remember the last time I laughed so hard at the movies. It's the most gleefully over-the-top spectacle I've ever witnessed. As the heroine, Rose McGowan is precisely on director Robert Rodriguez's wavelength, and Michael Biehn makes excellent fun of the type of character he's played in a dozen 'C' movies. This succeeds everywhere From Dusk Til Dawn failed.Maybe I would've appreciated Death Proof more if it had come first. For the first time, Quentin Tarantino's love affair with talk grates a little as you wait for his movie to get into gear. After the adrenaline shot of Planet Terror, it's hard to slow down to a crawl for half an hour while this segment sets itself up. It's as though he couldn't give himself completely over to the grindhouse aesthetic - he had to try to be clever, and that makes some of the dialogue stick out like a sore thumb. That being said, though, there is plenty of fun and edge-of-your-seat suspense to keep you interested.",8,1,3,15 April 2007
Life Is Beautiful," The most overrated movie of the 90's
","Despite its unusual approach (it's a holocaust comedy) this is at heart a fatally self-conscious, shamelessly lowest-common-denominator film with the subtlety of a brick to the head.  When he isn't straining to act 'lovable' (actually coming off as obnoxious), Benigni keeps busy pushing every easy emotional button he can think of.  But why should we care?  His romance is never made believable, and the horror of the holocaust is never made real, because the way he edgelessly films it, we might as well be watching a film set in a medium-security prison.  (The movie numbers a grand total of one effective dramatic moment, which is Benigni's artfully handled last scene.)The lowest point in recent Academy Awards history is when Roberto Benigni won best actor for this film (he was up against Nick Nolte, Ian McKellen, Edward Norton and Tom Hanks, all in career-best performances, for god's sake!).If you feel such a strong need to be manipulated that you don't care that the guy doing the manipulating is a shallow egotist, then this movie will suit you just fine.",1,65,162,7 November 2001
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," series has a shaky start
","An 11-year-old orphan finds out he is a wizard, and subsequently attends wizarding school, where he learns intriguing facts about his past.Too many scenes fall flat. From the moment Dumbledore casually walks on-screen, the magical elements are treated in a matter-of-fact manner; director Chris Columbus fails to imbue them with a sense of wonder. There are fake-looking special effects (the backgrounds during the flying scenes), as well as some good ones (the moving staircases). But the worst offender is the generic, intrusively over-active score.Despite all the flaws, the story carries you along. Columbus tends to encourage overacting, but several of the actors here (especially Maggie Smith) apparently didn't oblige. Alan Rickman is probably the best-cast actor in the movie.",6,0,0,12 June 2013
The Shawshank Redemption," unoriginal prison movie
","There are some things in this life we will never understand... How did the universe begin? What happens to our souls when we die? How did a movie as bland as The Shawshank Redemption become so overrated?In the case of certain other movies, I can at least understand the reasons why they're overrated. But The Shawshank Redemption is so... average. And cliché-ridden. The film's moral is basically that hope is important, and there's nothing wrong with that in itself. Heck - I have no problem with simplicity. The problem is when you move past the simple and into the land of the simplistic. The movie treats its borrowed plot parts (Count of Monte Cristo, anyone?) and banal themes as though they were freshly minted nuggets of wisdom. (I wouldn't be complaining if it didn't pretend to be anything more than a pleasant diversion.) However, it is with its very last shot that the movie reveals its true condescending colours. If it had ended moments earlier instead, with that poetic shot of the sea, I would have had some respect for it (that's where the superior original story ends). But no, the director had to spell things out for his audience. Frank Darabont knows how to tell a story. He just doesn't know how to tell one with any originality or depth.The movie is partially redeemed by three things. The majestic cinematography, the powerful score, and most of all, Morgan Freeman, one of the very best actors working today.As for my rating, yes I'm one of those jerks who gives a movie a 1 just to lower it on the top 250. I think it's outrageous how highly it's ranked here. Even the folks who made it would think it's ridiculous to consider it one of the greatest films ever made.",1,79,255,15 August 2002
1408," competent but flawed
","John Cusack plays an author whose specialty is debunking supposedly haunted locales. In this movie he tackles a hotel room, which he finds out really is, in the words of manager Sam Jackson, 'an evil f***ing room'. 1408 starts off on the right foot, using the skeptical Cusack as a surrogate for the viewer. And the writers and director do manage to create a few scary moments early on, but the movie is plagued by two main problems. First, the story is saddled with some heavy-handed 'lessons'. Second, and even more damaging, the movie is completely lacking in interior logic. The tricks the room deploys against Cusack are rather random, too often reliant on cheap shock value, and sometimes just plain laughable (It's too warm! It's too cold!! The sprinklers are going off!!! The mini-bar is empty! Oh, the horror!). And the way Cusack vanquishes the room is lame: he simply burns it down. Why would that even work on a supernatural room? Then we get the underwhelming final scene, when Cusack's ex-wife hears their dead daughter's voice on his tape recorder.From what I've read, the director's cut at least has a better ending, with Cusack dying in the fire he sets. Jackson later sees an apparition that implies Cusack and his daughter are reunited.",6,0,0,10 August 2008
Vanilla Sky," interesting failure
","It's nice to see Tom Cruise taking some risks lately, doing arty stuff like this movie and Eyes Wide Shut, and playing a drug addict in Minority Report.But risks don't always pay off.Vanilla Sky is a remake of the Spanish film Open Your Eyes, which I haven't seen. This is one of those movies where you're not sure if what's happening is real. I usually love this kind of movie (Jacob's Ladder is a good example of the genre), but Cameron Crowe messed this one up. It's hard to be affected (shocked, moved) by a movie that never goes beneath the surface of things. The characters aren't fleshed out, the relationships are never made believable, and the surprise ending has no weight - it may indeed be unexpected, but it is also rather uninteresting. The same concept was handled in a much less heavy-handed (and more entertaining and effective) way in Total Recall. I think the key problem is that this is a remake; I think Crowe could have done a great job if he had written his own original script. There are a few nicely surreal moments (such as the much-discussed Times Square sequence), but they are stranded in the middle of a failed experiment.The best thing about this movie is the director's great taste in music - the soundtrack features excellent, well-chosen tracks by Radiohead, R.E.M., Sinead O'Connor, and The Chemical Brothers, among others.",6,0,1,16 August 2002
Signs," sub-Spielberg, but worth a viewing
","This movie certainly owes a debt to Steven Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind, but the director is skilled enough to make it his own.One of the best decisions Shyamalan made was to show as little as possible of the aliens. And he is very good at setting up his scares. A good example is the scene where Phoenix is watching the first videotaped footage of an alien sighting - very creepy.Tak Fujimoto (Twin Peaks, The Silence of the Lambs, The Sixth Sense) is becoming one of my favourite cinematographers. His camera work is extremely effective at creating moods, usually without drawing attention to itself. The cast is uniformly good (except for cop Cherry Jones, whose backwoods act is not believable). Mel Gibson is limited as an actor, but this is his best work to date.However, there are some things Shyamalan is not so clever at setting up. He was on the right track in wanting the sci-fi elements to be grafted onto a solid dramatic story, but his script veers from intelligent to heavy-handed.The biggest eye-rollers are the daughter's conspicuous glasses-of-water neurosis, and the phrase 'swing away', which is ridiculously built up to be an earth-shattering revelation. I don't think Mel needed to remember his wife's last words to come up with the brilliant idea that helps save his son's life.",7,0,2,30 October 2002
X2: X-Men United," surprisingly good
","Mutants good and evil must unite to fight a foe who wants them all dead. This sequel would be completely ordinary were it not for a few clever touches.With the benefit of confidence, it gels better than its predecessor, powered by a more dynamic story (which doubles as a metaphor for homosexuality) and rock-solid performances by Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen, all of which lends it a bit of substance.On the debit side, it remains fluff (a major character dies, for instance, and I found myself totally unmoved), some characters' superpowers are too vaguely defined to be compelling, and the special effects are mediocre.",7,0,0,21 January 2007
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," the series ends on a high note
","Harry and his friends make their way back to Hogwarts for a final confrontation. By this point it's clear that this is no longer a children's fantasy story. The stakes are kept high by a sizable body count and heavy themes such as self-sacrifice. The film is anchored by Harry's weighty realization that he is a horcrux and that he must die. J.K. Rowling's clever final plot turns remain intact, including a moving trip through Snape's memories. Slight changes – such as having Harry and Voldemort confront each other away from everyone else – render the climax a bit less memorable than it might've been. Also, Harry's relationship to Ginny feels rather perfunctory, having barely been established in the previous films.",8,0,2,12 June 2013
Jackie Brown," a refreshing change of pace
","The people who were disappointed with this film were probably thinking, 'How dare Quentin Tarantino make something other than 'Pulp Fiction 2' after making it big?' Which is a very narrow-minded way to look at things.This is Tarantino's Elmore Leonard adaptation / blaxploitation homage / Pam Grier worship movie. It doesn't grab your attention like his previous two films, and that's because here he slows down so as to draw more detailed characters. He's abetted by the actors, who turn in rich, flavourful performances, including Robert De Niro, who makes his character goofy and very funny.There are only two things holding this movie back. This is the first time Tarantino isn't doing his own thing - it's an adaptation, and this seems to have led him to be a little too self-conscious in terms of style. Also, the film could afford to be ten-fifteen minutes shorter.",8,1,2,22 April 2005
Jurassic Park," a return to form for Spielberg
","I've noticed the general public often lumps Steven Spielberg movies in with the rest of Hollywood product (because they're popular), and it drives me nuts. The guy is an artist, and shouldn't be placed in the same category as hacks like Roland Emmerich or Michael Bay. Granted, the period from 1986 to 1992 was a pretty dry one for him. This is why I was so excited when I saw this movie.Like a roller-coaster, this witty, very entertaining adventure/fantasy climbs that first hill slowly (the first half hour feels forced), but once it gets going, it is terrifically scary, with exhilarating, inventive, expertly staged suspense scenes, which will carry you over plot holes and implausibilities. The script is unfortunately as schlocky as its source (a Michael Crichton novel). The story could easily have turned laughable, but it was skillfully handled. The only other flaw of importance is the self-conscious acting of the child actors, especially Joseph Mazzello, who acts like someone who watches too much TV. What breathes life into this movie is Spielberg's sense of wonder. And it's the first time since The Color Purple that it feels like he's fully invested in a movie. This was the first time he makes extensive use of computer-generated effects, and perhaps this new toy fired up his imagination. When digital effects first became popular, Spielberg and James Cameron were the only two directors who truly knew how to use them. No one else used them with as much imagination and purpose. Digital effects felt as though they were merely inserted with a click of the mouse. In Jurassic Park, you can tell a lot of work and imagination went into perfecting the images (down to individual drops of rain on a dinosaur's head) so they would be as real to the audience as possible. Spielberg magically transports you to the world he has created.",8,1,3,15 August 2002
The Simpsons Movie," well done
","They didn't screw it up.It might sound like I'm damning the movie with faint praise, but I'm not. You have to realize that the creators of The Simpsons faced a very daunting task. How do you honour the legacy of a show that's been using up plot ideas and jokes for almost 18 years? How do you not disappoint your very demanding fans? Well it turns out you start by acknowledging what those fans have been saying all along - that the show's golden age ended about ten years ago. You acknowledge this by hiring the writers who worked on the show during its heyday, and you refuse to put out a movie until it's been lovingly crafted into the best Simpsons movie that can possibly be made.The effort has paid off. The movie deftly side-steps the many traps it could have fallen into (too many guest stars, too much self-consciousness about being on the big screen, relying too much on past glory, catering to the masses, etc.). Quality, edgy laughs are plentiful. The plot takes over a bit too much by the second half, but not to a disconcerting degree.So how come I don't rate the movie higher? Because The Simpsons belongs on TV (or at least it did, back when it was a great show), in 22-minute chunks. It's out of its element as a 90-minute movie. It's a small miracle that the result turned out as good as it has.",8,1,3,10 September 2007
