Miracle," Great
","I have to admit that neither of my kids got the absolute feel good of this movie. I think it is a much better thing if you remember the event.I remember that I NEVER watched the hockey games even though I watched every other bit of the Olympics. For whatever reason I had the Russian game on that night. Wasn't paying attention but had it on as background noise while I was reading. All of a sudden the noise came through and I started watching the game. The feeling that night was magical. This movie captured that feeling all over again. The ending may be the all important part but, learning how that team was put together was just as important.I have seen it several times and I cry every time. Not to be missed.",9,1,1,19 September 2005
