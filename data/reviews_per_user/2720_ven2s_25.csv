Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Rich dialogue and Fast action
","The surprise of volume 2 is not just it's fast action and a very shocking burial scene/experience,but its rich multilayered dialogue.  It was a pleasure to hear the characters, especially Bill aka, David Carradine, in conversation with Uma Thurman's character, B*@#*~`%&!The volume is shear genious and should have been included with Vol 1 as, the director originally intended, one long film.It is a real treat for the eyes and ears and I highly recommend it!!!",9,0,1,24 April 2004
The Incredible Hulk," If you enjoyed Iron Man, you will enjoy The Incredible HULK!
","This was a great homage to all the preceding HULKs, while maintaining its own originality! I was moved by a lot of the sensitive moments and the non stop action from beginning to end! Although I am one of the few that thought Ang Lee's take was also well done, this version makes that one pale in comparison. With great acting by Ed Norton, who captures the bittersweet struggle that Bill Bixby bought to the character, and excellent acting by William Hurt as the cold calculating General Ross; this movie has few misses. Liv Tyler does a great Betty Ross, but Jennifer Connelly would have been even better because she would have brought more emotional depth to the character.All in all, money well spent and not too violent for the kids, as long as you go with them. I sat with a bunch of teens and preteens and they were really engrossed in the action, although they missed some of the more poignant homages. If you enjoyed Iron Man, you will enjoy The Incredible HULK!",10,5,10,13 June 2008
Mission: Impossible III," The 3rd Time is a Charm!
","To be honest, I was not impressed with the first two Mission Impossibles. Why? Because they did not contain the Team concept of the original! In the first one, Ethan's whole team of some really good actors, are killed in the first 45 minutes or so of the movie! The second has him and Luther as the only real team members but still Ethan is a lone agent! Finally this one brings in a whole team while maintaining the heroism of it's central character. Also we have a somewhat complex storyline, a great villain, and some good acting! But the really big draw is the nonstop action and amazing stunts, many of which Cruise did himself!",8,0,0,12 May 2006
United 93," Amazing..and a timely reminder.
","Like so many, I had to make myself go to this movie because I felt like it maybe too soon. But really, this movie is a timely reminder of 9-11, the impact of which, though still being felt, has been fading from the forefront of most of our minds. Our anger has faded and our determination compromised because of Iraq and the length of time it is taking to find Osama Ben Laden. This movie is like Pearl Harbor or Saving Private Ryan, in that it reminds us that people shed their blood and gave up their freedom for the welfare of others and therefore; they, and what happened on September 11th, should never be forgotten and should never fade from the forefront of those minds who witnessed this heinous act! We owe it to them and their families to remember why terrorism should not be tolerated and to endeavor to find a solution to this virus in every society.",10,1,4,12 May 2006
Spider-Man 2," AMAZING!!
","You've probably read a dozen reviews some positive, some not so.  let me just say that anyone who has too many  negative words about this stunning sequel to an already great on going story, just doesn't get it.  This is a comic book superhero who has become so real to children and adults alike simply because of great movie making and excellent scripts.  What really impressed me about this movie is how well it follows the spirit of the Spiderman comic books without belittling the depth of the characters.  All the actors do brilliant jobs, especially Albert Molina as Doc Oc who does a convincingly realistic and menacing supervillian who has lost all he loved.   The director also has us on the edge with the love between MJ and Peter Parker...will it be realized?? Or do we have to settle for a Clark Kent Lois Lane scenerio? Like a rubber band, our emotions and expectations are toyed with and there are surprises and revelations!With over the top action, some of which will have you about to jump out of your seat in shock, and a great story; Spiderman will not disappoint.",10,0,0,1 July 2004
Alexander," Alexander was Great!
","I don't know why this movie is getting so much bad press. From complaints about the 3 hours plus running time, to assertions about wooden acting, I went expecting this movie to be a waste of time. But after watching the history channel's History or Hollywood, I decided to take a chance, since, apparently, this movie is very accurate-given the little that is known about Alexander's private life and thoughts.I found that this movie is, first and foremost, for those who are into history and other cultures and especially Greek mythos and culture. The ethos and peoples of that time were, of course, different from those of our time and-specifically-our culture. In a thousand years, others will look back on our culture and time and find them very alien to theirs with few similarities.Beyond that, this film shows the genius and humanity of this great man and what situations and experiences made him who he was. The bulk of the movie is couched between two great pivotol battles, the first against the Persian Empire and the second against India. Although I found these battles to be highly realistic and amazing, given the strategy that these peoples employed, the movie is less battle and more about character. If you go for blood and guts without substance, you won't like this movie; it engages the mind and emotions more than anything else. But the acting, I thought, was quite good; especially from Colin Farrell, Val Kilmer-not usually a favorite of mine, and Angelina Jolie-who has disappointed in the past. But decide for yourself, it is, after all, only my opinion. By the way, for me the 3 plus hours flew by pretty quickly. And all this from a guy who really prefers women.",9,12,24,27 November 2004
Troy," The More Things Change...
","This stirring epic based on Homer's Illiad shows how little has changed in over 3ooo years. Men still yearn to leave their mark on the world, to gain immortality at cost to their families, their lives, and their mortal souls.  Kings and Tyrants  still send innocent souls off to fight their wars rather than fight them themselves.  And a nation of a thousand years can disappear in a day. Proving that old aged addage is true; the more things change, the more they stay the same.  But what has disappeared in those we tend to hail  as heroes, in general, is honor and self sacrifice; the true heroes, even in our culture, do these things and tend to become legends only shortly after they have died.  The Greeks honored their heroes even as they lived!
Troy captures the immutable truths of Homer's timeless epic, a time when giants walked among men.",10,24,46,15 May 2004
The Day After Tomorrow," A Good Flick That Could've Been Great!
","Well I have to say that I enjoyed The Day After Tomorrow, but it could have been so much better.  Initially the movie has a grand international scope and almost takes on the memorable 'bigness' of Independence Day. 
Although it starts off as a climatic shift for mother earth, it really ends up being a dramatic shift in priorities for Dennis Quaid's character and his relationship to his son.The movie has a few warm moments, some bone chilling moments, and a few what if, moments.  Especially the impact of a climate change on the northern hemisphere and its impact on the 3rd World.Overall, a good flick to go see and unwind at but not a great flick to see again.",6,0,0,30 May 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Convoluted? Are you kidding???!!!
","I almost did not see this movie because of a number of reviews that reported the storyline as convoluted. Convoluted, are you kidding?? This movie was intricate with an ending, I believe, few could have figured out. The effects were excellent, with some magically memorable scenes. But anyone but a child or someone who does not want to think while viewing this movie, would find it convoluted or meandering. Are there holes, sure, but I know of very few movies without them. Although it has what could be considered multiple endings, these are character resolutions that help to complete this installment. Make sure that when you see this movie, that you sit through the end titles, because, as usual, there is a surprise at the end. Who knows, there may yet be another installment, but I doubt it.",9,27,46,29 May 2007
Spider-Man 3," Spiderman 3 a bit long...but
","Spiderman 3 is a bit long but gets its message of forgiveness and redemption across quite well. The other message; allowing one's dark side to take over and all the consequences, is very obvious; like StarWars, there are consequences or choosing a wrong path. Unlike the former installments, which used there time more effectively and told poignant stories. This installment is a bit too long winded and borders on preachy. But who cares, it's Spiderman and the special effects are great! There are also some memorable scenes between Mary and Peter and between Harry and Peter and even the Sandman. Forgiveness is the key that moves one from a dark past, into a brighter future.",7,0,2,29 May 2007
Cloverfield," Intense!
","I thought that this movie would have its best scenes in the trailers, so when I went in I did not expect too much. But I did expect that it would be different given JJ Abram's influence on Alias. Well, if you're not much for jumpy cameras and are prone to motion sickness, you probably will not stay too long in the theater. But if you can focus wide and not get caught up too much in the details, you are in for an intense and unique take on the monster hits a major city (New York) genre. Where does it come from? What is it? One can speculate, but the movie is really dealing with the trauma of a small group of party goers and their encounter with the extraordinary! The effects are amazing, the acting by relative unknowns, hits on all marks; making the movie all the more convincing to the very end. Not for the faint of heart or the under-aged; under 17s might be up nights with the shakes, definitely don't take preteens! Way better than, 'The Mist,' a must see for giant monster fans everywhere!",9,166,301,18 January 2008
The Bourne Ultimatum," Grrrrreat!!!!
","Excellent storyline and tie ins from the second movie, show the subtle genius of the best Bourne at least since the first! There is a really great story and plot line and tons of excellent martial arts and car chase scenes. By the way, this should not be the last Bourne, since a forth book by Ludlum, reveals all and shows why the spy chose to become what he became; from what I've heard, it is the best of them all. There is a possibility that there will be one more movie, but who knows, I hope so. Matt Damon does a great job a the tortured super spy who finally comes in from the cold...or does he; the viewer must determine that. But you won't regret seeing this adrenaline rush of a movie, one well thought out.",10,1,2,10 August 2007
The Village," Hope and Love in the Face of adversity.
","I think there have been too many bad reviews about this movie, more than the good, I almost believed them and would have missed a really good movie. Like most, probably all, of M. Night's movies, he has an ability to use film to convey metaphors and truths that most of us either take for granted or have forgotten.  'Signs,' for example, was about the loss and gain of Faith. 'Unbreakable,'  on face value, was about the truth of good versus evil and the legend of a superman/messiah; more importantly, though, it was about 'self image' and how an accurate or distorted one can shape who you will be.I believe that most of the bad reviews about 'The Village' are written by those who missed the forest for all of the trees.  This movie has a simple theme...that one should maintain hope and love in the face of adversity and evil; that love will conquer all.  All this may seem stupid but I bet if you re-watch some of these movies with these themes in mind, you will see them in a new light.I highly recommend this movie.  Go with an open heart and mind and, whether you agree with my interpretations or not, you might actually get something out of the experience.",8,0,0,5 August 2004
Cold Mountain," An amazing and moving civilwar oddesy of love, faith,and endurance.
","I did not know what to expect of this film, but I was presently surprised. This is a movie for every adult that beautifully explores the scars of the civil war and the endurance of true love without being mushy or sentimental. Each main character is heroic in their own way, but the pivotal character is Ruby(played by Rene' Zelwigger).  If you haven't seen this movie, you will not be bored.  It has tense action and heart moving romance and alot to say to each of us in these trying times...",10,1,1,25 January 2004
The Alamo," Very Moving
","This is a very character driven movie especially as it looks at the involvement of Jim Bowie, David Crockett, William Travis, and Antonio de Santa Ana.  The first three were men basically running from their pasts, whether from legend or infamy, while the last believed he was the Napoleon of the west.  In the end, those who were not seeking fame nor saw themselves as heroes but deeply flawed human beings, became true heroes and eternal; while the last, although remembered, became less than what he thought he was. In reality, the Alamo was Mexico's response to an insidious invasion by the United States across it borders through americans who either became mexican citizens ( in order to be elligible for lands)or were descendents of such and became known as Tejanos. In other words, Mexicans fought Mexicans at the Alamo. The other basic cause of this fight, was slavery. Many of the heroes of the Alamo and those in the lands of Texas held slaves and the Mexican Government had outlawed slavery. Many of the slave holders rebelled against this imposition by the Mexican government and this ultimately culminated in a civil war and the ultimate acquisition of Texas, initially to be a country unto itself apart from the United States, but was soon assimilated into the other states but is still a Lone Star.Although this is hinted at in the movie, a viewing of the history channel's presentation on the Alamo and Davie Crockett, will give one a deeper understanding of what the context was for this tragic yet heroic conflict. Why heroic? Because the people at the Alamo faced a hopeless situation with dignity and determination. Regardless of their views,  they shed their blood for what they believed and for freedom. Right or wrong, their blood won Texas. In these days in which we are involved in a lengthy war whose outcome is trully unknown, will Americans show the fortitude to see it through or will we cut and run?  Remember the Alamo where ordinary people did an extraordinary thing!",8,8,9,24 April 2004
Van Helsing," Great Fun!!
","Unlike many of the reviews in which this movie is seen as bad, I must differ.  It made perfect sense to me and had a simple plot with alot of action and some campy humor!  I think the best way to see this movie is without any expectations or preconcieved notions.  Like so many legends these days, they are either updated or totally redone, from King Arthur to Batman; what you see in the movies usually differ drastically from the legendary heroes.Overall, this movie was fast paced with implied gore and a nice ending, for those not too hardened by all these revenge movies and reality based dramas; a nice adrenaline rush, like Van Helsing, is a great change of pace!",7,0,0,13 May 2004
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Excellent
","Although this installment of Harry Potter has a few predictable parts  this is outweighed by some subtle twists and unexpected turns. Most of all this movie is full of warmth and humor, a trademark of all the installments that I have seen. Initially it may appear a bit scarey for kids but as the movie progresses it becomes a great family outing both for the kids and for adults. The score by John Williams, as always, is also quite excellent and the young actors turn in very good performances.",9,0,0,4 June 2004
Hellboy," A very good Movie that could have been Great!
","This movie's strength was its quirkiness and this is where it's greatness lay.  The story is a marvelous blend of metaphor and adventure involving an uncanny superhero, his efforts to please his father,his desire to be accepted by 'normal people' and his distant love for his uncanny mutant girlfriend mostly seen through the eyes of his very human assistant. Outside of that core story is the greater adventure of good verses evil. It's a great comic romp with a beautiful and poignant end that brings home the metaphor it is portraying.  But a little more pushing of the quirky envelope and a little more character development in Hellboy's relationship with his father, then this would have been a great movie!  I hope they do a sequel and develop all the characters even more, because they are all memorable very human personalities.",8,0,0,3 April 2004
The Mist," Great effects, so so acting
","Many will like this movie for its special effects and shear scare factor. But acting by Thomas Jane was questionable. Good at points, in his more crucial scenes, where he has to really emote deep grief, he tries but ends up straining at the bit. In fact he tries so hard that it comes off too strained. Marcia Gay Harden does a convincing role as a crazy religious fanatic, so good that you will end up hating her character. The little boy and the majority of the other actors do a great job, but where the rubber meets the road, on Thomas Jane's broad shoulders, it melts and flops. He is convincing for the strong parts but his deeper emotional value is not there, and this is crucial for the impact of the movie; especially at the end. Although you will probably get shaking by the effects and the out of the box thinking of the movie.",6,1,4,8 December 2007
Chariots of Fire," Inspiring
","Although a very awe inspiring movie, probably one of the best about track and field and motivation of runners in the Olympics, it has a number of historical inaccuracies. But I believe these licenses were taken to promote dramatic tension and the underlying message of the lives of two very great men in a time of great men and women! Don't forget that this movie premiered in 1981 and many movies took dramatic license without declaring that they were based on...etc. Movies have done that more and more recently, and are less factual than Chariots ever was. Check out the Mothman Prophecies, it's just vaguely like the book. So I am not offended that Eric Liddell knew about the 400 a year in advance, or that Jackson Schultz never gave him that note, although in fact a note was given. Or that Harold Abrams ran in an earlier Olympics and won nothing although he was a great athlete and well loved by his schoolmates. But I believe that it captures the spirit of two very driven men and the differing motivations that drove them, and in so doing immortalizes them, the times, and those around them!",10,3,4,19 August 2007
The Happening," A character driven movie with shallow characters.
","Although I found the subject matter in the film engaging, I felt that Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel were miscast in their respective roles. Their shallow acting, except for a very few convincing moments, took the punch out of this movie. For me, I found the extras and minor characters more convincing; but for them, the movie would not have been engaging at all! The acting done by the couple who owned the green house, was especially good and they should have been the main characters as their relationship-their acting-was more convincing. The lady the main characters meet in the old house was also extremely well acted and riveting. The talents of the little girl and John laguzamo were also under used. But when it came to Mark and Zooey's performance, the air just went out of the balloon; no deep emotive content and very disconnected from what was happening. And deep emotive content is what was needed in this film, Mark and zooey would have taken the heart out of Sixth Sense, Signs, and Unbreakable; movies requiring mature acting; even the Village would not have survived. So M Night's character driven movie lacked just that, the characters to truly leave you with the impact of what was happening!",5,1,6,14 June 2008
War of the Worlds," Intense
","War Of The Worlds is the second movie since the 50s version with Gene Barry, who makes a cameo appearance in this movie. This installment of the H.G. Wells classic is so realistic that you will experience the terror and dread of an alien invasion very unique to this genre but not unlike the dread caused by Orson Well's broadcast that caused a mass panic in this country. This Movie faithfully follows H.G. Well's book down to the general shape of the alien machines while paying homage to many key scenes from the original Movie, it is faithful to the book down to the ending, which will be understandable to those who have either seen the first movie or read the book but may be anticlimactic to those who haven't. The departure that this movie makes is that instead of concentrating on the central character(s)who narrates the book and original movie, this installment gets into the life of a family caught up in the terror. With amazing acting by all, especially Justin Chatwin and Dakota Fanning, who play Tom Cruise's children; this is a must see of the H.G. Wells classic! (Little kids should not see this movie, it'll probably give them nightmares, seriously. I saw one little boy jumping out of his seat numerous times out of shear fright.)",10,4,13,29 June 2005
Creed II," If you live long enough...
","If you live long enough, you get to see history repeat itself. Although this movie has great warmth and heart, it cycles the old story of Rocky being beaten by Ivan Drago, and the former's steely comeback via a harsh, rigorous training program. The trick with this installment is that Creed is Rocky, and Victor takes on his father, Ivan's part. The warmest moments, for me, were when the movie departed from these predictable outcomes. Of course, to new eyes, much of this is hidden under a new slightly more involved story. Unlike the original, Creed, which I found to be incredibly moving, Creed 2 had its moments, and near the end, found the magic of Creed!",6,0,2,24 November 2018
Sin City," Captivating!
","Frank Miller's Graphic Novels are brought to life, in a way, in this anthology reminiscent of Pulp Fiction but uniquely different. This highly imaginative, violent, and provocative movie is set in the alternate reality of Basin City whose inhabitants are shades of grey to very black. Tough guys of dubious character, put their lives on the line defending or being defended by amazingly strong and deadly beauties. Filled with frames and photo works that are living portrayals of Miller's graphic novels, this movie will keep you hooked from the very beginning to its surprise ending! You'll be talking and thinking about this one, long after the credits have scrolled by.",9,0,1,1 April 2005
V for Vendetta," Why the Controversy??
","This was an excellent movie and probably most if not all of the reviews have said this. So why do some see this as a movie glorifying terrorism, rather than one denouncing tyranny and unjust governments?? This is a rallying cry for oppressed people to stand up against those who oppress them, whether as an individual or as a collective whole; to me this is the theme of this movie. Was Dietrich Bonhoffer a terrorist because he aided in a plot to assassinate Hitler?? Were the Founding Fathers terrorist or revolutionaries?? I guess like some opinions, it depends on which side of history you fall on. In the end, I think 'V' would say; 'think for yourself and come to your own conclusions.",10,4,8,23 March 2006
