Blade Runner 2049," Just a nice visual with an empty story
","The beauty of the original was how original it was. This movie has the same flying cars, same city. And unfortunately what would have been amazing in the 80s is now hum drum with 3D computer effects. The movie spent too much time on his love life with a hologram. It almost seemed like it was trying to show off CGI. I wasn't impressed. His love life was sad and not worthy of all the screen time. It had some interesting scenes with some nice cinematography. But the story was just so empty, I kind of wanted more. And really when you're continuing a story line, you shouldn't rely so much on CGI. The story really needs to be the key. Because the original has already cashed in on the originality of the plot and idea of the story, not to mention the visuals. You can't just re-do the original, that is too boring. Very disappointed. It seemed like a plot written on a weekend after some studio said, 'We'll give you $100M for a sequel' and they wrote while watching the Final Four and drinking beer.",6,1,5,19 March 2018
Alien: Covenant," I simply liked it!
","It was probably that I watched it after all the bad reviews piled up and expected a horrible movie. Or people saying it was just 'another Alien movie' that made me severely lower my expectations. But I thought it was a good continuation from Prometheus. It wasn't just a bunch of Alien monsters running around some building or spaceship with badass gunslingers trying to take them out. It was a very creative and artistic movie in comparison to the other Alien sequels. Was it the best sequel to Prometheus, which I thought was an amazing departure from the idiotic path Aliens had gone down? Maybe not. I think exploring 'our creators' would have been far more interesting. But that said, I liked it. Wasn't disappointed.",9,2,5,8 December 2017
