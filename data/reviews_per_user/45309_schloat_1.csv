Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Thoroughly Entertaining...It was everything I hoped for and more!
","In my opinion, this movie lived up to the hype.  While there were a few awkward moments I was enthralled from start to finish by the history, the story and the characters.  As expected the visual effects and battle scenes are mind-boggling.  This movie is not perfect, but neither was Episode 4. I think the Phantom Menace gives us about as much as we could have asked for, and then some.  I can't wait for 2002!",10,0,0,20 May 1999
