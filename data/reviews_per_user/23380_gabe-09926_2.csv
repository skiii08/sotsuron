","GENERAL CONSENSUS (BAD, OK, GOOD, EXCELLENT): OK for adults, Excellent for Kids*SKIP BELOW TO VIEW MY SETUP
Do you ever wonder why you enjoyed movie more in the theatre than when you bought it on blu ray it home? We all know films are more exciting and exhilirating when watching them in the theatre (i.e. more immersive). The simple answer of course as to why our viewing experiences are better in theatres than at home has to do with the limitations of our media to view it at home (TV's, blu ray playes, home theatre systems, etc.). With the advancements of todays technologies in televisions now days such as high resolution TVs (4k's and beyond), improved media formats (blu ray, 4k UHD) and frame rate manipulation (24P vs 60P) etc., among many other features, this has brought us closer than we've ever been to being able to match theatre qualities that ultimately give us that same immersive experience. Unfortunately some new features of todays tech can actually hurt the viewing experience as well. Your setup is going to be vital to how you experience a film and ultimately what you thougt of it. You may be telling yourself 'well duh, everyone knows that, so whats your point?' The point I'm trying to make is that not everyone knows this and may have an improper setup when writing a reviews on a film. This is especially concerning to me when I see reviews suggesting films were 'bad,' 'outdated,' or 'what were they thinking, people actually thought this was good.' Case in point, PLEASE, make sure you have the proper settings when viewing films before making a review on it as it can most certainly effect what you thought of it.I am a film lover and nothing brings me more satisfaction than to see others experience that same level joy as I do. Conversely, nothing upsets me more than to see a good film get torn to shreds due to an inadequate setup. So instead of giving you my 2 cent review of a film, since there are so many good reviewers out there already, I will simply rate the film and state whether I thought it was good, bad, ok or excellent and tell you how I watched it. Obviously settings are subjectable to each setup and individual perspective and I am in no way shape or form suggesting that my way is the only correct way but rather this is how I enjoyed it and you might like it that way too.",5,0,3,12 September 2019
