The Sound of Music," Enjoyable musical but......
","Although this is one of the better translations from stage to screen it still suffers from the curse of the movie musical. Some of the better (funnier) musical numbers have been left out of the film. A visually stunning film that carries the basic story line form stage to screen, there is just something missing as far as the overall musical is concerned. Leaving out the number done by Max and the Baroness is akin to leaving 'I'm Calm' out of 'A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum'. It leaves a hole in the whole.",7,1,8,28 August 2000
American Beauty," Jane was right (possible spoiler)
","I don't know where all the high praise came from. The story was quite predictable, the acting was passable(certainly not Oscar quality, I think Kevin Spacey came across as a better actor in 'A Bug's Life') and (possible spoiler!) you could see the ending coming 20 minutes before it got there. I think Jane summed it up nicely early in the film when she said 'Pathetic'. If you want to see a dysfunctional family movie worthy of the Oscars it won, see 'Ordinary People'. Not a black comedy (?) but a far better film.",1,3,8,22 May 2000
Duck Soup," Ahead of their times?
","Duck Soup easily rates a 10 out of 10 from me but,..... for all of you who classify it as a film ahead of its time, sorry, but your about 37 years too late. This film is very loosely based on the 1896 Gilbert and Sullivan operetta 'The Grand Duke', their last and least produced work (mainly because it was so far ahead of its time). If you get a chance to see a live performance (unlikely, its still rarely produced) or if you can get a hold of a copy of the award winning 1999 Seattle production (listed on the IMDB), do so. Although not as slapstick as the Marx Brothers, still a great piece for background material and theatrical insight and a real treat for Gilbert and Sullivan fans.",Null,0,0,13 May 2003
Shrek 2," why?
","Hated the first shrek (mean spirited, stupid, lousy animation) The second is a perfect example of why sequels should not be made. There is nothing worth seeing or hearing in this film. Ten years from now people will only vaguely remember the first and will probably be surprised that there even was a sequel. The animation is stiff and unappealing, nothing at all when compared to the average Pixar film where you see every hair on Sully's body move with a totally realistic look, or you see the very molecules of water move as Marvin and Nemo swim through it. Mike Myer's Scottish accent (????) has got to be one of the worst ever. I've heard 6th generation southerners who have a stronger natural Scottish accent then this embarrassment that he keeps subjecting us to. All in all this film rates a -3 out of 100",1,5,16,25 October 2004
Shrek," Change of heart
","One of my kids hadn't seen Shrek, so we rented the dvd. When I first saw this film in the theater, I rated it a 1 out of 10, (the 1 was for the 1 time I laughed) Having now seen it on the small screen I feel I must change my rating. This film OWES me. I figure its about a negative 5 on the rating scale.I get more laughs out of 50s B-movie sci-fi then this piece of **** could ever conjure up. By all means see this film, preferably somewhere where you can have a stiff drink afterwards to wash the bitter taste out of your mouth.",1,6,17,11 March 2002
Shrek," I don't get it
","Where was the great story, the great character study, the overflowing laughs, the incredible computer animation? Certainly not in the film I saw. How did this movie ever get to be such a high grossing film. People must have gone back a second and third time because they couldn't believe how bad it really was. The characters had no redeeming qualities. The only one even remotely funny was Eddie Murphy. He's the reason I gave it a 2 and not a 1. The story, in general was boring and extremely predictable and the computer animation left much to be desired. Final Fantasy had far better computer animation and from the clips I've seen of Monsters Inc, well it leaves the others in the dust visually. I usually grab animation dvds the moment they come out. In the case of Shrek, well, maybe I'll watch it again when it comes out on cable but I certainly won't waste my money on it. Not a keeper.",1,5,14,22 October 2001
Gladiator," Maybe it will be better on the small screen
","First off let me say this film was merely OK, nothing more, nothing less. We've seen this story dozens of times before, in a dozen different genres, from gladiator movies to football films. The antagonist attempts to, and sometimes does, force out the film's opening hero only to have the hero come back, after a period of rebuilding and soul searching, and defeat the antagonist in the end. James Caan and John Houseman did it much better in 'Rollerball' The characters were all your standard Roman cliches with the exception of the wonderful final performance by Oliver Reed. This was the film's one saving grace.The film style in the battle and fight scenes was rocky enough to give the most stalwart rollercoaster fan motion sickness, while the more cerebral portions of the film were so deadly dull that these sections could cure even the worst insomniac. I saw the film at the Cinerama in Seattle and that magnifies everything about the film, especially its flaws. Maybe it will be easier to watch when it hits the small (TV) screen.",2,0,3,31 May 2000
