Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It was difficult to find anything I disliked in this film.
","I had the honor of seeing the first official showing of this film at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday morning (May 19).  Two thoughts crossed my mind as I left the theater.  My first was, 'I can't wait to see this again.' and 'I don't know if I can wait for part II.' I must admit that it was difficult to think there was going to be a new Star Wars movie without characters like Luke, Han Solo, Princess Leia, etc. I have now seen Phantom Menace twice now, and I realize the more I see it, the more the characters will become a part of me...just as the classic ones have.  Qui-Gon had that perfect calm yet confident attitude that is the perfect attitude for a Jedi.  Obi-Wan with the anxious Jedi pupil outlook (I look forward to following Obi-Wan's experiences in the parts II and III). All the real (non-computer generated) actors I found true the Star Wars tradition ... except two.  Jake Lloyd (Anakin Skywalker) was somewhat of a drawback to TPM in that his acting was cardboard and quite unemotional.  I think George Lucus could have cast someone a little more talented.  The emotional scene with Anakin and his mother was a bit uneffective as a result of Lloyd's acting.  I also have an extremely hard time believing Samuel L. Jackson as Mace Windu.  Reason being, Mace is a highly respected member of the reknowned Jedi Council.  As I watch, all I can think is 'Pulp Fiction'.  I feel Samuel has been in so many movies and he seems to accept every script thrown his way.  I also think he was trying way too hard to act like this respected character.  There's times when he's on screen and he appears to be over-acting to the point that it's actually bad acting.I've heard that something like 90% of this film is digital.  Before I saw the movie, I must admit I was quite nervous about this statistic.  I have found that some digital scenes in other films look quite fake.  In Phantom Menace, however, there were actually times when a character was on the screen that to this day I still can't figure out if he was computer generated or a person in a costume.  The digital and special affects were by far the most state of the art and realistic I've seen to date.Now...the plot.  I've read some critics' reviews, and a few are saying the plot is thin and could have been told in a 30 minute film.  I personally have no clue what movie they watched.  All I know is the movie I saw was a fitting beginning to a classic series.  The way this movie progressed is that for a good part of it you find yourself learning more than anything. A lot of time is spent on learning characters and understanding what is taking place.  About 2/3 of the way through is when the tension absolutely reaches out and grabs you.  If you are a die-hard and life-long Star Wars fan like myself, you'll find yourself feeling various emotions and feeling quite satisfied once this film is over.  I truly believe Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace is without a doubt equal to the hype, and faithfull to its predecessors.",Null,0,0,24 May 1999
