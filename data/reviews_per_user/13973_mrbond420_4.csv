The Longest Yard," Why does God let this happen?
","It's so tragic that they keep coming out with bad re-makes. Especially trashy MTV-style schlock like this. I was excited to see this because I like the original, I like Adam Sandler, and I like Chris Rock. I was horribly, horribly wrong. A lot of the jokes were just so unbelievably tasteless or moronic that I almost wept when I heard people laughing at them. I can't believe God would make people stupid enough to think that this film was entertaining. It is obviously geared towards the same idiots that went to see Stealth, the Dukes of Hazzard, and anything else that was promoted out the ass on every TV/Radio station/Billboard for months because they knew the movie would suck and people would stop seeing it after 1-2 weeks.",1,1,3,12 August 2005
American History X," An excellent presentation of a controversial topic
","I think this film did a wonderful job of presenting the extremes of racism as it still exists in America today.  The story is original, and the acting is above average.  It is a topic that few would dare to touch, but this film explores it in a riveting fashion.  I would highly recommend this film to others.",5,3,10,17 May 2001
Hellboy," Don't waste your time
","If you are like me, and thought that this movie just might be worth seeing in theaters, I'm here to warn you that it's not.  I went in without hearing anything about it, knowing nothing of where hell boy came from, and hoped that I could lend an unprejudiced view.  Right from the start, the movie begins throwing characters, important concepts, and bizarre events at you. Thinking that most of these things will be explained, you wait....and wait. The truth is, no explanation ever comes.  You never really even figure out what Hell boy is or who he is.  This goes for most every character in the movie.  All of them are developed only enough to loosely connect the plot, which suffers from the same development issues.  I'm not an idiot who can't things out on my own, the others who went with me also had fifty questions, and we all had different answers when we walked out.  The acting is not good, but it is bearable, and only hurts the film in a few places, thankfully. Basically, you're going to spend a lot of time trying to figure out what's going on and who everyone is, and you'll have lots of time to ponder since this movie is mostly just a few long, drug-out action sequences anway. Save your money, folks.",1,15,24,7 April 2004
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," A masterpiece
","The word masterpiece is something reserved for films that are perfect, or almost so.  This movie a wonderful cinematic achievement.  Jack Nicholson and the characters who support him create one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen in my life.  If you have not seen this movie, you have problems.  Go get it today.  It is easily one of my favorite films of all time, and it will be yours, too.",10,1,2,20 May 2001
