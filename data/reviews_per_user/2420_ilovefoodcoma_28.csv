Captain Marvel," Not the best in Marvel series
","After watching a few of Marvel series... this movie definitely not one of my favorites. The story is so-so, not the most interesting. The twist in the movie isn't that surprise either. The fighting scenes a alright, not as powerful as the other super heroes. Of course, there is no real 'ending' because there is always 'to be continued' for the next movie. Will I watch the next movie, YES! Because a few of my favorite super heroes are coming back!!",6,2,4,15 March 2019

Bohemian Rhapsody," Great movie to know more about Queen & Freddie Mercury!
","The Story: I always love watching movies based on true story because it is like watching a 'documentary' in more entertaining way. I always see & envy the band and Freddie Mercury on the stage or screen but this movie I got to see 'behind the scene'. See how hard they worked to get to where they were, all the ups & downs. Most important Freddie Mercury's personal relationships with his band-mates, his family & his love interests.The Directing: Did I shed a tear? Yes~ very touching!! The way the director telling the story, really got me attached to the characters. They portrayed the characters as close as possible.

Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Still prefer the original classic spiderman
","The Story: I personally still prefer the classic original story of the Spiderman. This movie is a little bit too many 'version' of spiderman? It is true they all have their own special power but just a little bit confusing & overwhelming. Unfortunately, there is no 'wow' scene for me.The Animation: I watched the 3D version. The animation is well done!",6,3,14,31 December 2018

Avengers: Endgame," Hard to say goodbye....
","Is it really over? Still couldn't believe all my super heros are leaving the big screen. At first, I was worried what the script would be like? Three hours movie? It seems long... However, after watching the movie, 3 hours not enough, wish it is longer! Because so many characters and so many stories that need conculsion. It is unbelievable how many great actors/actress are involved in this movie, many of them just appear for a few seconds. There are so many loyal Marvel fans around the world. It is indeed an awesome franchise!",10,0,4,2 May 2019
Toy Story 4," This is the last one, right?

Hotel Mumbai," Based on true event
","What a tragedy..... The movie used a little of real footage of the event, totally blended in with the movie and showed how real the scenes are. Sometimes when I read the articles of any sad incidents, it was hard to picture what really happened. With this kind of movie, it absolutely puts me in that moment. The movie might be a little bit slow in the beginning but it definitely tells the story well.",8,14,42,6 April 2019
