Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," God Awful
","This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. For those of you that have said this is the funniest movie ever made obviously the only other film you have seen is Fast and the Furious Tokyo Drift. It is filled with repeated jokes which a 13 year old could have written. Not to mention if the jokes aren't bad enough the first time for you they are repeated again and again and again. If I had the option of seeing The Hulk and paying double to go see it, I would gladly go see the Hulk. Those of you who like the movie, are obviously part of a sub-culture. I wouldn't recommend this movie for you if you were blind,deaf, and mute(particularly mute because you couldn't scream during the film.)",1,21,45,5 November 2006
