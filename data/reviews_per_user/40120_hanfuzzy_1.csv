Come and See," Don't expect to be entertained
","I rented this based on the comments here, but was disappointed. Unless you live for foreign art films, stay away. This movie goes on far too long without getting to a point (if it ever does, besides war is bad for everyone), and I've seen way to much of that anguished kid staring shocked and dismayed at the camera (about half the movie). There isn't much war going on, just tragedy, atrocity, or pointless wandering around the edge of war. Lack of dialogue and explanation means that much of the time you don't know who people are or where they're going or what they hope to accomplish when they get there. Luckily I had ironing and sewing to do while watching this, or it would have been a total waste of time.",2,29,110,10 February 2003
