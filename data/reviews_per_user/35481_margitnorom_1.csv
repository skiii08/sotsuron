The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Absolute the best movie experience in the history!!!
","LOOKS LIKE Christmas CAME EARLY!!!!!I had for a long time been looking forward to this film and when I finally saw it I was at the edge of a mental breakdown. It was SO good! It had captured all the important details of the book, captured the longing Katniss feels for Peeta perfectly and it was just perfect!!! I was a bit scared they would end the movie in a way that it would reveal too much information, but I have never seen an ending this exciting before. A true cliffhanger there! The director Francis Lawrence have done an incredible job and I have to applaud him for that. I have never seen a film where the actors are so great at showing facial expressions that they told an entire history in their faces, but here I am super amazed and surprised. This is one of those films that makes you long for more. Can't wait till part 2!!",10,26,67,21 November 2014
