Requiem for a Dream," Interesting, but depressing experience!
","I rented this film not knowing much about it. I was pleasantly surprised how quickly I was drawn into the plot and the characters. I was intrigued by some of the creative editing techniques - which provided a really amazing rhythm to the film. It helps you really feel the character's experiences.The title demonstrates that it is a serious film. (Requiem means a hymn, composition, or service for the dead.) However, many people who may not be familiar with this word's meaning might not know that the movie's title translates roughly to 'Death or Funeral of a Dream...' It lives up to this title well. This is not a happy film. It's really quite depressing.Overall, I recommend the film, but I also strongly suggest you make sure you're in the mood for the emotional roller coaster it will take you on. This is not entertainment. It's an experience.",Null,1,1,17 October 2001
