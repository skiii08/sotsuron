Catch Me If You Can," One of the most entertaining movie of the year
","To me, to watch a movie is in seek of entertainment.  Not trying to pursuing some profound, wonderful meaning in life (unless I'm watching some movies like the Truman Show, that's one of the very few movie that actually makes me think).Catch Me is a movie that gives you a lot of entertainment.  To me, this is enough.  Movies are part of the entertainment industry, not a part of your lecture notes that you have to get tested on.  Just watch this movie as an entertaining story, it's a pretty good film.  Humorous, exciting, and a good plot line.And of course, Tom Hanks did a great on portraying the somewhat dumb, upright, and persistent FBI agent Carl.  Leonardo Dicaprio has done so far the best job on portraying a character in all his movies, the smart, cunning and somewhat flirtatious young thief Frank.A very nice film afterall, not one of the best in history, but one of the best in the year.",8,1,2,1 January 2003
Forrest Gump," my all time favorite
","This is my all time favorite movie, since the first time I saw it! before I saw this movie, people were telling me stuff like 'this is a very serious movie,' 'this movie is all about life, you have to pay close attention to every word the characters said while watching it'...etc.Well, so far I've seen this movie about 5 times.  Since the first time I saw this movie in high school, I don't really see how serious this story ever gets (except for some of the really touching scenes, if you wanna call it 'serious').  To me, this story is extremely entertaining, extremely!  I can't stop laughing from the beginning till about the last 20 minutes (and the part where Forrest's mom died), then I want to cry.My feeling is that... a lot of people are stretching it too hard to make it a serious, meaningful, deeply insightful movie.  It doesn't have to be (although it can be in some ways).  Forrest Gump can just be a movie of enjoyment.  Take a break, watch this movie; and take it easy while watching it, not every movie has to teach a lesson even when other people told you so.  This is the most entertaining movie you'll find out there if you are not spending all your time trying to squeeze out a profound meaning out of everything in this movie.",10,0,3,1 January 2003
The Pianist," Good movie, but makes me depressed
","Have to say, it's a good movie.  Nicely made, good story, great filming and shooting techniques.  I can totally tell the makers of the movie spent tons of time and money in making this movie. But one thing that made me not like the movie is that it's too dark.  It's a very good movie, but it doesn't make me feel good.  It's one of those movies that I watch and admire the making of it, but when I think about it, I feel depressed and down... it's like a feeling that something really 'heavy' has been piling on my heart and gives me this strange emotional pain. For people who likes to get 'entertained' by movies, this is not one movie I'd go see. Good movie, but not one of those I'd recommend or go watch it with a friend over the weekend to have fun.",6,2,4,14 August 2003
