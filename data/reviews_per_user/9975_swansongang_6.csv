Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Better than people say
","I always get annoyed when people say how bad this movie is. I always feel they're overreacting. Phantom Menace has a few flaws, but is otherwise good. There are only 3 main problems I have. One is explanations. Obviously this movie was made after the OT, but I felt it was supposed to be presented as the first one. A lot of things, such as lightsabers and mind tricks, are not explained and may confuse people. Second is acting. I actually don't see too much wrong with this, but here and there Jake Lloyd delivers a bad line, as well as his friends and such. Third is the corny parts. Examples are JarJar's battle scene and a bit of Anakin flying his starfighter to save the day. But all three things aren't too bad, and I only wish the IMDb offered 9.5 stars, because I just can't give it a 10. Oh well, a 9 is still an A.",9,7,10,24 July 2005
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Harry Potter and the Spanish Inquisition
","WARNING: THIS CONTAINS SPOILERS! I could type a very short commentary about the fact that over Summer Break, the Spanish have conquered England, Hogwarts has been used as a bomb-testing site (don't worry, they rebuilt it, and it has a clock tower, too), and my uneasiness about having a breath mint passed off as a soul. But I won't. I am going to type a very long commentary about one of the WORST book-to-movie adaptations of all time. Please note that the 5 is only given from a MOVIE standpoint; to be fair to all those fools who have not read the books, I will not give it the 2 I so dearly desire. Check the threads later for a complete review of my rants, but here are a few. One: If they were not sure about what souls look like, DON'T HAVE THEM SHOW IT! The book doesn't have it--the dementors are pretty lame in the movie in that scene. Two: WHERE ARE THE ROBES!? They are wizards, they wear robes, not...not...MUGGLE GARMENTS! I think Alfonso or someone just wanted Hermione to show off more. You'll notice that she is center on some of the posters, and very prominent. Three: Er, where's the backstory? Ron doesn't seem too angry at Hermione for having her cat eat his pet. In the book, they argue. Not here. Now,they all just are a happy bunch, and getting very mushy, too.Four: WHAT HAPPENED TO HOGWARTS!? It is not the same castle--and why is there a pendulum? Poor Neville is going to get clobbered by that thing!Five: Speaking of Neville, where is he? And Goyle? And everyone else? Wood? Nope. Cedric? I think he gets roasted by a lightning bolt. Malfoy? Where is that evil-looking, arrogant, cold, smooth villain, anyway? He seems to be missing. There's only an ugly meanie who looks similar.Six: Does it disturb anyone that there are shrunken heads everywhere? Consider: where do they get these heads? Think of that. Seven: How did Sirius escape? They kind of forget to say that. Plot hole, right there. Also on plot holes, the thestrals are invisible, despite the fact that Harry saw Quirrel die in #1. (This is not a mistake in the books). And might I inquire WHY there are so many weirdos who sing with TOADS? Also, Harry is a nobody, it seems--he has never won a Quidditch cup...but another key plot hole: wouldn't it be proof that Peter was alive if they found his CLOTHES on the GROUND!? Eight: RUN FOR YOUR LIVES! IT'S THE KILLER BIPEDAL GREYHOUND! Nine: Does a pathetic howl really sound like a werewolf, or is that just because it was the killer bipedal greyhound? Ten: The school is not safe. Our dear headmaster Dumbledore thinks hitting Ron on the leg is amusing! And he saves Harry when he falls, but lets the Hufflepuff seeker get blasted out of the sky!Eleven: In the book, Harry never sees a Grim. He only sees Sirius. What is that cloud formation? Twelve: The final shot is kind of freaky.Actually, though, there were one or two good parts. Buckbeak looked awesome, and some of the magic usage was cool (no longer flashy, but actually magical). And Lupin and Sirius were great, though Sirius did seem a little happy for being in a soul-sucking prison for twelve years. And John Williams is good once more. But seriously, this movie was the biggest letdown I have had. Check the post '100 Complaints about the Movie,' coming soon, for a list of book-related comments. Most of the above concerned the movie. Thank you for your patience, and watch the fourth one...AND READ THE BOOKS! TEN TIMES BETTER THAN THE FIRST TWO MOVIES, TWENTY TIMES THE THIRD!",8,0,1,28 May 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...
","STAR WARSEpisode IIIRevenge of the SithIt has been a dark time for StarWars fans. Energized by the Episode Itrailer, fans raced to the theaters, onlyto be displeased beyond belief.3 years later, Episode II was released, andthough it improved on the latest movie, it wasstill a displeasure to many.Yet now, the great GEORGE LUCAS has set out to redeemhis failures, and bring order to a universe that hasbeen in turmoil for many years....All I can say is that it was good from the Fox/Lucasfilm drumroll to the final explosion of music for the end credits. Despite slight bad acting, some corny dialogue, and droids with voices that abruptly changed for the worse, and perhaps some other things that others might complain about, the movie had its definite ups. This is the one everyone wanted--this is the ultimate Star Wars movie. From the opening space battle to the climactic lightsaber duel, from the mush to the music, from the laughs to the tears, the movie accomplishes all that was expected. Foreshadowing, conclusions, and basic stage-setting, this movie will have fans running to watch the original movie one more time. This is Star Wars at its grandest--the space opera that takes your breath away. For over a thousand days the Star Wars prequels were the targets of jokes and slander in the movie industry. Before the third movie. Before the conclusion. An young director named George Lucas, who was a little-known director before he formed Star Wars, has helped create the greatest movie saga of all time. Lucas was seduced by the dark side of the movies, some said--but now, he has returned. He has returned for revenge. At last he has revealed his skills to the Republic. At last we have Revenge.",10,4,9,28 May 2005
Shrek," Good movie, but too crude.
","Do I have to write anything more than the title? I enjoyed the movie--I thought it was hilarious, the way they spun off on the regular fairy tales and ogre images. The animation was stunning, the characters fleshed out very well, and the story was most impressive. If it weren't for all of the crude 'humor' and sexual references, I would have loved it. But, when Mike Myers is involved, civility goes out the window. I must say that I loved all of the twists and turns in the movie...and Donkey was hilarious, even if he was a bad sign from the start. Eddie Murphy certainly did better than Mike. I give it a seven out of ten--a C, but a middle C. Amusing yet offending...I have the same misgivings about the sequel, but I want to see it.'One of a kind!' --Shrek",9,0,2,17 June 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Good, but definitely overrated
","This is one of those movies that you see and think, 'Wow, that was awesome!' But then, you go back and think a bit about it. At least I did. Okay, I will say this: the visual effects are outstanding. The battle sequences are very well done. And those are what wow you. I left the theater thinking it was an awesome movie, mainly because of those sequences.Yet as I go back to this well woven fabric, tons of threads all of a sudden seem out of place. The beginning of the movie, for example, set me off. 'Saruman is in Orthanc...'...well...now what? Are...are we going to see him? Is he going to kick the bucket? Yet no. Instead, it's a simple move on to the next phase of the movie. Later, as Legolas slides down the Oliphant in his awesome-cool-make-the-fangirls/boys-flip moment, I wonder, 'Why was that showcase of special effects considered more important than 5 minutes of screen time for one of the greatest actors of time?'Another part that sets me (and other book fans) off from this third installment, is the scene where Sam leaves Frodo. WHY?!? He knows 'Mister Frodo' is in danger...Gollum is leading him to a mysterious entrance to the land of evil, and the 'Stinker' side is becoming really obvious to Sam, and Sam just leaves Frodo! The fellow hobbit he was willing to run out and nearly drown for, to leap into the way of a Ringwraith, is going off to face death directly, and he leaves him! This lapse of character, merely to get Sam out of Frodo's way so that Frodo can be bitten, does not fit well into the movie.Finally, the character of Gimli, I felt, had the complete wrong personality. Whereas, in Tolkein's masterpieces, Gimli is a battle-hardened dwarf who no orc should tangle with, his scenes seem to be mostly comic relief. Delivering quips and one liners in the middle of a battle, acting weak and cowardly merely to make light of the near death of our beloved characters does not go over so well in my mind.Overall, this was an enjoyable movie. You'll need a while to watch it, but it is an enjoyable time. I recommend the extended edition, as it adds in so many scenes that should have stayed (Saruman's death, the Mouth of Sauron). Jackson let me down with the third one, but you still have to see it.",7,2,5,2 June 2005
The Matrix," A wasted plot...
","There are many fans of the Matrix movies out there. Die-hard, weirdo, and theological. Agents, all of them.I must say that this movie did not impress. The main theory, the central story plot of the computer simulation being the real world, was the only thing that kept this movie from being discarded into the rubbish bin. The effects, hailed as amazing, did not fully impress. There was too much foul mouth, immorality, and otherwise HUMANITY'S WASTE PITS on screen. Violence was extreme--and unnecessary. The entire story could have been turned into a magnificent three-hour movie with excellent dialogue, scenery, depth, and other aspects that make a good movie. Instead, it was all mashed into a sludge of action and destruction and basic hatred of other people. It was disgusting. Furthermore, the acting was abominable. Look at it closely, with the hatred given to Star Wars by so many envious people, and you will see that Keanu Reeves makes Hayden Christenson look like an Oscar winner.My opinion. And I hope that you agree. The movie could have been much better, much more interesting. Not to mention, the final shot kind of destroyed the end...I cracked up there, laughing hysterically. Was that supposed to IMPRESS? Sorry, takes more than that to impress me.Twenty percent.'Wars not make one great.' --Yoda",2,5,9,17 June 2005
