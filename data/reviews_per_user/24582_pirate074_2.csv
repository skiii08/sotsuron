The Ring," What scares YOU about this movie?
","I have read posts about what this movie does to people. People say they are scared to get up, to roll over in bed, or maybe scared of closets. But why haven't I heard anyone say anything about turning on the TV? When I went home the night after I saw this at the theater it was dark and I was alone, and I will tell you one thing... I steered CLEAR of the TV set! I was also leary of putting blank VHS tapes into the VCR. What scares you about this movie?Also, I wonder if there would be any way to get a VHS that is an exact replica of Samara's tape. You could get family and friends good!",10,1,1,25 February 2003
Gettysburg," Good enough for a 7.4?
","I thought this movie did a fantastic job of portraying what life on either side was like, their information was right on, and the depiction of the battes was great. But what about the acting? This was hands down the worst acting job I have ever seen out of Berenger and Sheen. Nevertheless, this was still a great movie, but was it good enough for a 7.4? So far Gods and Generals only has a 6.3, yet it has actors like Robert Duvall and Jeff Daniels. Why is this?",Null,0,2,18 February 2003
