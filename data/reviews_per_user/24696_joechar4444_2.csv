Iron Man 3," Iron Man 3 is a fun big-screen blockbuster with heart but also brains.
","Bringing comic book adaptations to life on screen seems to be a difficult balance for anyone that's not Marvel it would seem. Could they do it again here? The answer to that is a resounding YES! Other studios and some directors think that translating content which is mostly successful on paper through to a live action takes some extra clever handling or major changes. Marvel knows that nothing could be farther from the truth. Trust the material for the most part and the movie will blossom. Sure, Marvel can change and adapt within their own universe when the need arises. The Mandarin in this very film is the perfect example of change done right. Mandarin needed more than a tweak to work on film and what they crafted here was brilliant. Thankfully, director Shane Black and Marvel worked well together because the team up resulted in a film true to Marvel's heritage but also something new and fresh.Iron Man 3 is a fun big-screen blockbuster with heart but also brains. It's smart and benefits from an amazing screenplay. It wonderfully blends experienced, award winning actors with a balanced mix of story and action. The comedy works so well on many levels. There's the 'hit you over the head' type humor and then there's the drier, sarcastic comedy that Robert Downey was born to deliver. Everything meshes here for one of the better film going experiences of the year.",Null,1,7,28 April 2013
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Lackluster and Frankly A CGI Mess
","Another long journey that pretty much delivers exactly what is expected of it. Frankly, I found that to be mostly a bore. The film has some nice action moments but too much of it felt like bad CGI. What could only be called the super powers displayed by the elves as they slaughter orges left and right actually pulled me out of the movie. It really gave off a video game vibe to me. Also, the chapter feel has grown tired because yet again they don't end the film but rather set up the finale. Despite the large budget, this effort felt very lackluster and I really did expect better. This coming from a fan of the trilogy. I really lowered my expectations after the first effort but this continuation is just more of the same but at a limper ratio.",Null,6,9,15 January 2014
