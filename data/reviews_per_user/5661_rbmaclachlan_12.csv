The Avengers," It's just become very babyish.
",I to be honest and say when the movie came out it was going to be a hit but now every time I watch it I see things that are so wrong with it like for example Thor is a GOD! Which makes him practically invincible so that fight he has with iron man in the woods is redundant and makes no sense Thor would destroy him only hulk could fight him because hulk is god like hawkeye and black widow serve no purpose in this film Loki is done very campy in this when he should very dark destructive every time i see him I laugh and think how stupid you are Hulk was OK I found the CGI OK at times but some of it was down right awful iron man was cool funny as usual captain America was boring to watch the plot of the film is laughable and makes no sense.Overall if you 13 year old kid you'll love it because you nothing better to do but as you get older I'm pretty sure you'll the same as I do just give it time.,7,2,5,15 January 2014
The Expendables," Great action film enough said.
","I have to be honest there was a guy who wrote a review about this movie and I have to say I totally agree with it. I mean from the get go when the trailers hit TV screens people should have known what to expect I am a fan of Sly movies so I wasn't surprised only excited to see what he had to offer and man did he deliver with a bang I thought it was great from start to Finnish but I have to say that the final part of the film is the best bit but i,m not giving anything way you just have to go and see it and you be the judge. Out of all the performances I have to say that Mickey Rourke's character was very well done and I thought well thought out coming in at second place Jason Stathem I thought in this film he was much believable than his other characters and overall all other characters portrayed there characters very well. Overall this movie to be honest is a movie where you can leave your brain at home and just enjoy the action with your mates or your girlfriend if she's into all that.",7,3,6,12 December 2010
Pacific Rim," Great movie that delivers great action heart and soul.
",Saw this movie yesterday and came away with a feeling that finally a movie like this has been made in the right way because this movie was inspired by the anime mecca movies and cartoons and I think that Del toro did his research very well as he always does in bringing this type of movie to life. I think one of the things that struck me about this movie deeply was the fact the robots was controlled by humans which to me gave the robots purpose and drive you feel for the robots because they are manned by humans there was never a point were during the movie the action lacked because as i said before Del toro thought very carefully about what he wanted to show in regards to action story and detail to me he is a director who takes great pride in what he does and he wants it done in the right way and I respect that greatly. I would just like to say to all the people who are comparing it to transformers that is fine and your opinion but they are only similar because they are giant robots and that is it in my opinion Michael Bay needs to take notes respect his craft because he from what he has given with transformers has really make it look very all money no heart and that is not what it is about.,8,6,11,14 July 2013
Ant-Man," Enjoyable,funny but weak villain yet again.
","In the beginning when i was growing up i knew of Ant man and was never really sold on the character and him able to shrink wasn't something i liked as a power. Thirty years on and the trailer hits and for some reason i got interested so interested i went to my local comic shop and bought some comics and I am so glad i did because I realised that he really cool.Now on to the movie I found really enjoyable and very funny the chemistry worked really well with all the cast involved, I will say though that the villain of the piece was a big let down it went down the lines of same old story.The effects where pretty cool to and all the ants was awesome.I will say also that I would of loved to have seen what Edger Wright version would been like but it is also good that he wrote this.Overall the movie is great fun and a great laugh.",8,13,25,1 December 2015
Captain America: The First Avenger," Good but good is not enough.
",I saw Captain America the first avenger yesterday and I have to say that it was not good enough in my eyes. It started off really good I really got the sense of the 1940's but that was all it was just something to look at nothing else. One of the things i found very boring and also needed to be shorted or taken out was the part where captain America was promoting war bonds and rallying up the troops in the old costume it went on for far to long and I was sitting there thinking can we get to the next bit. Another part I found really underused was the bike chase scene I feel that he should of used his shield to take them out it would of been quick but it would of also been entertaining to watch. The characters were also a let down extremely but the worst was the red skull didn't find at all evil or menacing what so ever he cared to much about world domination and less on crushing captain America and the hydra which made no sense. But the worst part of the entire film was the final where Steve rogers wakes up in the modern age but we don't know what year because they do not specify anytime in the film besides the 1940's and the the avengers tie in was just ridiculous and rushed it seemed like they just wanted it out the way and it was like they were saying to us the avengers is coming dumb and stupid.,6,1,7,30 July 2011
Man of Steel," This is the movie i wanted the first time.
",Saw this ages ago its being released tomorrow on Bluray I have not got round to reviewing it yet so here I go I thought this movie was a great improvement over the first outing by Singer and honestly this is the movie I wanted the first time but I am going to be honest here and say Singer messed it up the first time but Znider did mess a few things as well First his parents in my mind were done completely wrong Jonathan Kent played by Kevin Cosier the character played with a sort dark intention because he says you should let the passengers die on the bus so not to find out who he is this to me was a hell no in the comics and other movies he is played as gentle man who would say things or let innocent people die znider obviously wanted to make the movie kind of dark with this sorry Znider it didn't work.secondly Clark Kent being from another planet was revealed backwards by that I mean nobody knows that his from another planet he exits among the human race in secret hence the glasses and the dorkyness finding out during the film kind spoils the movie and the ending because by the end he becomes the dorky Clark but louis Lane already knows who he is which is another thing that does not work here Lets go on to some positives of the filmAction in this is great and over the top and what is really meant to be like in my personal I believe that Znider was heavily influenced by the anime cartoon Dragon Ball z if you have not seen it go on you tube and check it out you will know what I mean flying crashing through builders at fast speeds I would say though me being honest that it does become a bit boring though overall I think it is a enjoyable watch and personally much better than Singers rubbish.,8,1,4,1 December 2013
Drive," Just plain awesome.
","Just come back from seeing this film with my brother and I have to say in one word AWESOME from start to finish, to me it was shot beautifully I think I remember saying during the film very smoothly shot it gave me the sense that i watching a 80's film classic the opening minuets of the film are just plain great no dialogue just the smooth driving oh I said it again of the lead character. One thing that to me makes the movie stand out is the music it works completely throughout the whole of the film giving it a sort of motivational feel but keeping with the 80's theme.My last words are this is how a movie should be made so all though directors who think that they are great filmmakers really need to watch this film and learn something or just not bother being a director.",9,3,8,23 September 2011
X-Men: First Class," good but could of been better.
",I have just come back from watching X men First class a couple of hours ago and I have to say it has left me quite angry simply because this movie made to many references to the first x men movie when it clearly shouldn't of. Firstly Raven aka Mystique and professor X know each other in this movie which I was fine about it was a good portrayal of a relationship but when she goes with Eric at the end of the movie we are supposed to think that it leads into the first x men film which if does not because they do not know each other in the movie and that does not make sense. Another thing that I noticed and did not like with a passion was the fact that professor x did not create cerebro which we are lead to believe in x men Hank Mccoy is the creator which again is fine but does not make sense. Big mistake which got me so angry was the wolverine cameo which was plain stupid did not serve a purpose in the movie i think it was there purely for fan demand. I have to say that both main actors were great playing the characters very believable. The most to blame for the failure in Marvel themselves because they are not giving the director any creativity to make a good film it seems to me that marvel has all the say and that is final i really do hope that Marvel are prepared to change there ways in the future and not just do it for the money which clearly this movie shows.,6,3,16,1 June 2011
The Wolverine," Good beginning in Japan but insulting ending.
",Finally today was the day the Wolverine came out I had been waiting since the first trailer back in March or April out of all the comic book movies that have come out this was the one i most waiting for and here is what I thought.The look of the movie was fine when he was in japan they really captured the essence and authentic feel of the country it didn't feel like it was manufactured by the studio. As well the location gave it a some what darker tone and more serious look which made it more interesting to watch the action set pieces were OK i feel watching it that the character of wolverine in this movie was more able to fight and looked more like a man who could fight in the other movies the fight sequences to me were horrible and looked like a mess where as in this movie they were well thought out. The character of Wolverine was a little better but very much the same Jackmen clearly worked extremely hard in the gym this time round he did a great job as he always does.the girl with the red hair was fine along with his love interest fine.Viper was horrible villain and horribly portrayed by the actress whoever she is.jean grey why was she in this in the first place she serves no purpose at all.and finally Wolverine vs silver samurai robot was just plain insulting to see dumbing down like that when it came really close to being a really great film they do this it's disgusting Marvel should be ashamed.,7,4,10,25 July 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," A great end to a great trilogy.
",First off I want to say all haters out there stop hating because you should realise that you sound very silly. I think that this is the most anticipated movie of 2012 as soon as I saw the trailer I was so ready to see and now that I have it blew me away literally everyone in this movie gave perfect performances Anne Hathaway as cat woman she brought a new attitude to the character that hasn't been seen before Joseph Gordon Levitt was a new edition to the film and he was great to watch Gary Oldman as always gave a great performance as Jim Gordon Christian Bale as Batman was fantastic i found that there was a much more deeper character drive by Bale one of hurt and suffering and retirement And finally another new comer Tom Hardy as Bane really got a sense of terror but surprising emotion I felt after watching that there were many sides to Bane I really loved how his back story was explained and also how everything came together to conclude the final instalment of this great trilogy.,9,1,4,20 July 2012
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Took me right back to when I first saw a new hope as a kid thank you JJ Abrams
",Finally saw the force awakens and it was brilliant from music to great action set pieces Abrams has really captured the kid inside us all who grew up watching the originals he was really able to give his vision of how it should be and in all honesty he has taken the SW universe to places Lucas never could no disrespect intended to Lucas. I will say that all performances were great Ford and Fisher included and there was a great sense of humour in this which was a lovely surprise I think Adam Driver did a stand out job as Kylo Ren he brought a great sense of fear and horror to his character.but it isn't without it's flaws one being Captain Phasma she was built up in the trailers to be a formidable character but she does nothing in the movie she is a throw away character which is disappointing also snoke was a wasted CGI character and him being so big was dumb and the yellow CGI character with the big glasses was really silly would of preferred it being practical.But overall i will say that it is still a great film and a must watch for any SW fan.,10,11,39,17 December 2015
Deadpool," Finally Marvel are going in the right direction at least with DEADPOOL anyway.
",So finally seen the movie i have been waiting ages to see i was first was introduced to Deadpool around 4 or 5 years ago by my older brother I read a few comics over the years and i was hooked and he is my second favourite marvel hero first being Wolverine but I will say that in movie form Deadpool comes first he would probably say that to ha ha.On to the movie I found it very well executed I loved the opening credits simply because it's all about tongue and cheek and not taking it seriously the action sequences were really great to watch really over the top same goes for the jokes I couldn't stop laughing the bit with the hand growing back had me nearly in tears with laughter and the ORGINS WOLVERINE toy was a nice touch.I will say though that the story was a bit lacking and the villain was done poorly but not to enough to spoil the movie.The introduction of Colossus and warhead was great I liked the new version of Colossus really looks from the comics I would say this anyone who does not know the character and wants to see this movie go and research on him and then see how you feel about going to see the movie and always go with an open mind.,9,3,12,14 February 2016
