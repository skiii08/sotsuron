Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Taken as a whole, it's a great achievement
","I felt electrified after watching Kill Bill, Vol. 1, but felt that something essential was missing. I was dazed, my head spinning; it was a caffeine buzz. The first film flies by in a heartbeat. With Volu. 2, Tarantino takes a step back and creates a languid and more mature film. It's a great combination when taken together. The dizzying riffs on popular culture present in the first film slow down for Volume 2, allowing us to absorb them. I felt tired after watching Vol. 1; after Vol. 2 I was exhausted, but on an emotional level. The first film, with its beautiful gore and wonderful set-pieces, drags you along at a harrowing pace, while Vol. 2 simply presents a harrowing story. The final scenes between Bill and the Bride are moving in a way that is atypical of Tarantino's films. I actually cried. Jackie Brown revealed Tarantino's ability to dabble in pathos and sympathy; in Volume 2 he demonstrates that he has become a master of those techniques. It amazes me to think how dissimilar Vols. 1 and 2 are, but it's obvious that they need to be so disparate. The zipping, fanboy references in the first film might be annoying, appearing as if QT is saying look at all the cool movies I've seen. The second contains just as many allusions, but it seems to serve a purpose. Like Finnegan's Wake or Gravity's Rainbow, Kill Bill (as a whole) occupies an interesting level of artistic achievement--a creation that acknowledges all artistry and allows it to bleed into and out of its narrative at will. Kill Bill is, if nothing else, a compendium of late 20th century culture, and a brilliantly realized one at that. Kill Bill is the world that existed between 1950 and 1999, and that's an achievement.",8,2,4,9 April 2006
The New World," Dinosaurs
","Terrence Malick is a dinosaur--the one holdover from that gilded era of American cinema, the 1970s. While audience have bore witness to the erosion of his contemporaries' artistry (seriously, when was the last time Coppola or Rafelson or Bogdonovich made a worthwhile flick?), Terrence has stayed true to his early ethos by continuing to create lyrical, beautifully photographed, and not-entirely-narrative films. Of course, it's easier to keep your edge when you've only made four films in 32 years. The New World, though I don't yet think as highly of it as Badlands, is a great film and certainly on the same level as his other bona fide masterpiece, Days of Heaven (gosh, that his weakest film is the amazing The Thin Red Line is absurd, especially since it could have been the magnum opus of a lesser director). What I think is the film's greatest achievement is its ability to take figures that have become larger than life and make them real. In a sense, the film guts the mythology of Pocahontas but doesn't really give an un-idealized version of early colonial settlement--it simply doesn't give an idealized version of that time. Though it bemoans, to a degree, Pocahontas's 'crossing over' from native to Englishwoman (the scenes of her first adopting European garb are very poignant and melancholy, I think), New World does not make out the Englishmen to be evil, invading monsters. They are well-meaning, but they're not necessarily heroes. They're real men with real faults. Malick has done a great service to the story of early Colonial times by not elevating it to the level of epic; it is a very simple story of a very important encounter told without, really, too much looking forward. We bring historical baggage to the film, but New World does not really bring baggage of its own. That's amazing. The performances are wonderful with Kilcher and Bale the real standouts (Farell and Plummer are also excellent, but, let's be honest, at this point I expect that). Of course, it's tricky to judge a performance in a film by Terrence Malick, since much of the film's story is told through voice-over narration, but the faces of the actors he uses convey more emotions and thoughts than thousands of words could. In other words, if anyone could make a silent movie now, it would be Terrence Malick. As expected, the photography is also immaculate. Watching New World reminds me of all those things I adore about the geography of this country. It will make you realize why the colonists looked to this land as a sort of Paradise and why it still is a gorgeous land. New World will, I think, stand the test of time and be long remembered along side Malick's other masterpieces. It's a great film that lovers of cinema will enjoy. If you're looking for a rollicking adventure, though, you might want to go elsewhere.",10,1,4,20 May 2006
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Many years...
","It took me a number of years to finally appreciate the brilliance of E.T. I saw it originally around the time of its 5th anniversary and, as a seven year old found it rather dull. I didn't return to the movie for more than a dozen years and, in the mean time, I had grown and developed a taste for more subtle film-making. Though subtle may not be synonymous with Steven Spielberg, I do believe that the adjective is appropriate for E.T. Yes, there's the requisite chase at the end and the suspense engendered by the adult characters, but, on the whole, this movie is a subtle exploration of family and how it works in today's society.A lot of people hate Steven Spielberg, think of him as a hack who doesn't deserve his notoriety. Looking at E.T. again, I wonder how they can say this. E.T. is a fantastic movie that is fun for kids and also teaches them a lesson about acceptance and love that in the hands of a lesser-filmmaker would have been heavy-handed and trite. Spielberg knows that there's a lesson buried within his movie - a lesson to accept others as they are regardless of their differences - but he does not press this upon us.That is why, for me, E.T. will always be his defining picture. Within it are the adventure elements that characterize his brilliant first-phase and the social consciousness that appears in his later work. However, the social consciousness, as it does in The Terminal and to an extent Schindler's List, does not overpower the story and beat us over the head. For me, that subtle treatment of a very 'adult' theme in an otherwise science fiction movie proves Spielberg's brilliance regardless of the naysayers' opinions.",Null,0,1,6 November 2004
Casablanca," The Greatest?
","Leonard Maltin and his gang say that Casablanca represents the greatest achievement in the history of Hollywood movie making - the zenith of the Golden Age Dream Factory. Roger Ebert decided to make it the first in his series of reviews entitled The Great Movies. Lists of the ten best films of all time place it generally in the top-5. It even made the top ten best films on a list that places the Lord of the Rings trilogy higher than, oh, just about anything.Is Casablanca that great? Briefly, yes it is. Is it my favorite film or would I ever describe it as the greatest movie ever made? That is unlikely, but I will concede that they may be right to anyone who wants to argue that point. If you tell me it's the greatest movie of all time, I will say, you might be right. If you tell me the Lord of the Rings trilogy is, I will challenge you to a duel a la Zell Miller.Truth be told, Casablanca is my third favorite movie and I believe it is one of the greatest motion pictures ever created. It is one of the few true works of art the Hollywood system ever created. Like most great movies, though, it always begs the question - what's so special? Well, for starters, Michael Curtiz had, perhaps, the greatest cast of characters ever. You have the greatest male movie-star of all time playing the lead; you have a truly gifted and beautiful female lead; you have three of the greatest character actors ever in Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, and Paul Henreid.Second, you have an epic story condensed into a two-hour run time. The story has everything - murder mystery, war time thriller, espionage tale, love story, etc. As Umberto Eco pointed out in an essay, Casablanca is a collage of story types and moods; it has something for everyone.Third, and most importantly, it has the greatest movie ending of all time. As Rick watches Illsa's plane taxi down the Casablancan runway and he spouts that memorable line, you are shot through with a feeling that you have just been privy to something that is so perfect and right and you are amazed because, really, that ending would never make it to the final cut of a Hollywood film today. The bittersweetness of that ending is exactly what the narrative to that point calls for. Rick needs to stay; Illsa needs to go. Anything else would be trite and contrived.(As an aside, I was once at a bar having drinks with these two girls, one of whom I found incredibly attractive. I contemplated making a move with her and then the conversation turned to movies. She said, 'Casablanca is my favorite movie. It's soooo wonderful. I would just change the ending, though, so Rick and Illsa stay together.' I gagged and discontinued any plans for romantic pursuits I had intended to embark upon with her.) Casablanca is as close to perfection as Golden Age Hollywood ever came. It's a perfect, timeless movie that, I believe, every one can and will enjoy. If you have not seen it, do yourself a favor and rent it. It's wonderful.",Null,1,3,3 November 2004
Chinatown," Pitch-Perfect
","As a high school student, I grew enamored with the cult of Jack Nicholson. To me, he encapsulated everything I wanted to be: aloof, rebellious, and, above all, wicked cool. Of course, I was basing my perception of him on the roles he played on screen - not the best judge of a man, as he was 'acting.' Nevertheless, the idea of Jack appealed to me, even if it was mythic.In any event, he represents the first actor over whom I became obsessed. I've seen, I think, all of his movies from Easy Rider on and have watched a handful of those old B-movies (The Terror, some random westerns) in which he appeared as well. Though my older self often finds his performances grating (sometime in the early 80s he decided to play each role the same way), I still find his work in the 1970s fantastic - among the greatest work by any American actor.The apogee of his acting career, for me, has always been his portrayal of Jake Gittes in Chinatown. Yes, he's astounding in Easy Rider (in comparison to Peter Fonda's wooden performance it'd be difficult to appear otherwise), Five Easy Pieces, the Last Detail, Cuckoo's Nest, King of Marvin Gardens, Prizzi's Honor, and About Schmidt (his best performance since Prizzi's), but as J.J. he truly amazes.He provides his detective the one thing Bogie never gave Marlowe or Spade - a softness. Yes, Jake Gittes is for the most part a sexist, violent, egotistical man (as all detective have been since the Black Mask started printing Hammett's stories), but there is a Romantic under-current to his character that hits the audience from the title screen onward.Jake Gittes' machismo, unlike that of Sam Spade or Philip Marlowe (the filmed version - Chandler's Marlowe has more depth and is ), is a put-on - a cover that helps him ignore his pain, his emotions. Spade was a reprehensible womanizer and terrible friend. Marlowe wasn't much better. Neither of them, though, had a reason. Gittes does and Nicholson does a tremendous job showing the audience that below the masculine sheen something troubles Jake. He compensates for the pain of what happened in Chinatown by slapping Evelyn around and by taking on her father.The look upon Nicholson's face in the famous 'sister/daughter' scene is priceless. As he slaps Ms. Mulwray, he grimaces and we see that Jake hates what he is doing - he loves Evelyn, can't bear to hurt her, but feels he must in order to conform to stereotypical gender behavior and hide away his pain. Jake Gittes is the most conflicted and tortured private eye in film history and, I think, only Nicholson could give that performance.The other performances are equally memorable. Faye Dunaway is fantastic as Evelyn Mulwray, managing to make her sympathetic without allowing Mulwray to be cloying. John Huston, as her father, though, amazes nearly as much as Nicholson. In the film, Huston somehow manages to create one of the most terrifying villains of all time. His Noah Cross seems perfectly civilized on the surface but Huston gives Cross an edge. When he discusses eating fish with the heads still attached you cannot help but cringe; there's simply something so evil and slimy about him as he hunches over and eats the fish. We never see him act evil, but, through Huston's performance, we know.However, wonderful performances never create a great movie; they are only part of a great movie. Chinatown contains every component that makes a great film. The script never misses a beat, paying homage to and updating the detective movie (not necessarily the film noir, though, but that's another story). It also creates a perfectly realized and fascinating world through its cinematography and set design. Watching Chinatown, the audience feels as if they are in 1930s Los Angeles and can taste the dusty streets and feel the grimy heat on its neck. Moreover, Polanski's direction infuses the film with a certain European, existential dread that only an Eastern European could concoct.Chinatown would not be so fantastic, so perfect had another director helmed the project. No one else could have made a movie that is as paranoid and as pessimistic about our place in the world as Polanski did. It makes me happy that he made one great movie before being run out of town as a pedophile.*Spoilers* I probably stand alone in the belief that Chinatown is the greatest movie ever made, but I do not stand alone in saying this film is absolutely brilliant. Some may find the sour ending too glum, but think for a moment - would a happy ending ever have worked? Doesn't the movie's tragic mode require Gittes to endure yet another Chinatown? I believe it does and therefore must ignore complaints about the movie's ending; it could not end any other way.",Null,2,6,3 November 2004
Fight Club," An overrated film by an overrated director based on an overrated book by an awful writer
","I can't go on. No, I will go on. Fight Club represents one of the worst films I've ever encountered inasmuch it aims for intelligence and subversion but winds up wide of the mark. It's gimmicky and trite and all together pointless. I didn't enjoy it when I first saw it, and now I despise it because some people have elevated it to the level of a masterpiece. Those people are wrong. In trying to address violence in American culture (at least I hope that was the film's intention), the movie fails entirely. It does nothing to subvert the brutal violence on screen or address it in any meaningful manner. Look at Sergio Leone or Sam Peckinpah; they made often violent films that pique the audience's bloodlust only to ultimately undermine that desire for violence. Leone built up the tension and then refused to show you the gore you wanted; Peckinpah slowed it down to the point that the violence became unbearable. Fincher may have wanted to have the same effect on his audience, but he doesn't; the violence in Fight Club is enjoyed by the audience and they keep wanting more. It explores the lure of violence to a degree but then backs off this more thoughtful approach in favor of simply showing the violence. There isn't an attempt made by the filmmakers to question the characters' actions and that seems to me a grave mistake. As for the philosophical elements of this film? They're adolescent beliefs in breaking free of monotony and ennui; the anti-materialist screed, though justified by our culture, is ultimately shallow. It's angry at consumerism and our love of objects (doesn't this movie love gadgetry and gimmickry though?), but it doesn't really show us any alternative, unless the alternative is violence. And, frankly, I'm not willing to accept that. Or maybe the movie's just saying that the dehumanization present in contemporary society could lead to violence. That's okay, but what's the solution. When you have a film that doesn't really look at quasi- fascist ideas in horror, you need to offer us something. This adolescent nihilism is just, well, silly teenage claptrap. It's like this: when I was 15, I love A Clockwork Orange; I'm older now and find the nihilism of its characters as well as its attempts at formulating ideas about society superficial. That's probably what will happen with the majority of this film's supporters. They'll grow up and realize its an adolescent fantasy made by older men who have yet to mature.",3,9,25,16 April 2006
Akira," Technopunk
","I really don't have much affinity for anime. I love animated films, but, frankly, beyond Miyazaki, I'm not a fan of this distinctly eastern artform. Ninja Scroll and Ghost in the Shell mean nothing to me. Though a typical anime film in many ways, Akira seems different from all the rest. It's a fascinating film with wonderful animation, and it doesn't contain the softcore pornography that often passes for artistry in the anime world. It's been several years since I last saw this film, so only moments remain. What I remember: the apocalyptic showdown and some demented teddy bear spewing milk while the eeriest music I've ever heard plays. First, lets take the apocalypse--I love apocalyptic works of art; Mad Max, the Watchmen, Threads, etc. all had a tremendous impact on me growing up. Perhaps because I grew during an era of nuclear proliferation, I have always been terrified of World War III. Watching the Russian tanks travel across the wasteland of Afghanistan remains with me to this day, as does the fear that accompanied those images. Akira, at its end, taps into those childhood fears and those experiences awaiting the end of the world as we know it. This is an incredibly personal reaction, I realize, but one that I probably share with a lot of people between the ages of 25 and 40. And then there's the teddy bear. It's probably the single most disorienting and frightening scene in the history of animated film. While in a hospital room (and while probably drugged, I don't remember), one of the characters has visions of two stuffed animals grow to gigantic proportions. Milk starts pouring out of them (I think, maybe I'm imagining all of this) and this strange, frightening music plays. It's terrifying and brilliant. One should watch the film if only for those two scenes. The story, as I remember it, is fun as well, involving secret government tests and such. It's got a whiff of conspiracy to it, and that tends to make things better. All in all, a great little movie. If you like cinema at all, see it, and, if you think you don't like anime, then watch this and be amazed that you can stomach the stuff.",10,4,7,1 April 2006
Spider-Man 2," Best Comic Book Movie. Ever.
","Not that Spider Man 2 has much competition for the above title, but rest assured that it will remain at the top of that list for a very, very long time. The film certainly does not represent Raimi's or Maguire's (or Dunst's even) finest moments, but they put together such a terrific package that it's impossible to dislike.Spider Man 2 represents a great amalgamation of special effects, story, character, and feeling. It is everything the first Spider Man was not, namely exciting, thought-provoking, and moving.Spider Man was a noticeably weak film, as most origin stories are, with an unbelievably weak villain (it's hard to believe that Willem Defoe as the Green Goblin could be so...dull). The movie was nicely diverting for the two hours you spend at the theaters but, when you left, you left without any residual effects. Spider Man left your mind as soon as you got outside the multiplex.Spider Man 2 is different. Aside from its lackluster name (why wasn't its AKA Amazing Spider Man used?), there's nothing wrong with the film. The effects are fantastic and, unlike in the original, do not draw attention to themselves. The performances in Spider Man were adequate and here the central roles are solid. Maguire and Dunst do not 'act better' necessarily, but they are required to show more depth and intricacy than in the original film. Alvin Sargent is a very capable screenwriter and brings to this screenplay a craftmanship missing from David Koepp's. Sargent has more experience writing emotional nuance; for Spider Man's character, emotional nuance is key. Capturing Peter Parker's torture and ambivalence is no easy task; it requires a deft pen and Sargent came through. I'm also sure Michael Chabon's involvement did not hurt.What also separates Spider Man 2 from its predecessor is its humor. Spider Man lacked Raimi's typical gallows humor; the sequel, though certainly dark in tone, has moments of great slapstick humor. Raimi seems more in control of this picture, more assured in his ability to create a big-budget extravaganza.This confidence, I think, made the movie better. Raimi, more willing to take chances, swung for the fences and made it.Spider Man 2 is the best summer, popcorn movie I've seen since AI. It's also one of the few times a movie deserves its immense success. Though you should have seen this on the big screen (twice), I hope it will translate well to TV where everyone can enjoy it over and over.",Null,1,2,13 November 2004
Brokeback Mountain," Satisfactory
","Do you know how excited I became when my screenwriter friend told me Ang Lee was making Brokeback Mountain with Heath Ledger, Anne Hathaway, and Jake Gyllenhaal? I just about flipped my wig, more or less. I just about drooled at the thought of Ang Lee tackling the landscape of the American West (here is a man whose Ice Storm continues to color my experiences of driving through southern Connecticut and Westchester--every time I pass by Rye and look at my surroundings I can't help but think of that film). And the actors? They're among my favorite young actors. That's not even mentioning the brutal story by Proulx, which ranks among my favorites shorts of all time (significantly better than anything else I've read by her). So what happened? My idyll began unraveling around the time I saw the trailer for Brokeback, which was closely followed by an article in the Times about how the film executives planned on marketing this film as a romance. Well, it is, but looking at the images that floated through the preview it became apparent that it would also be Romantic. I hoped my instincts were incorrect; I hoped they wouldn't transform a very gritty and sexual story into a beautiful and sensual tale of woe. Proulx's prose, as Stephen Holden wrote in his review of the film, is tough and gnarled. It reminded me of an old man's knobby hands. That this style told the tale of the doomed lovers made the story all the more affecting. Jack and Ennis are Marlboro men and Proulx told their story the way they would tell it themselves. Yes it was a sad and touching romance, but it never forgot what type of men these were. The film, unfortunately, fails to translate that style visually. The film is stunning to look at but the tale is completely Romanticized visually. In that way, it becomes more sentimental too. That's the gravest fault I can find in the film. Ang Lee managed to transform a tale of romance into an actual Romance. Moreover, the grand vistas of the West inflate this story. Proulx's tale was terse and gritty and small. The film looks epic and feels that way too. These things should not have occurred. Allow me to quote from the Proulx story: 'The room stank of s***n and smoke and sweat and whiskey, of old carpet and sour hay, stale leather, s**t and cheap soap.' My censorship lessens the impact slightly, but I think that makes my point. Ang Lee did the same thing. The above sentence describes the motel room after their reuniting tryst. Mr. Lee took all that and cast the room in a rosy light. He casts the whole movie in a rosy light, while the story is dusty, dirty, and tragic. Maybe it doesn't help that I fell in love with the story years ago. The impact of the movie--of Jack's death and the shirt within a shirt (one of the greatest images in contemporary literature)--was completely lost on me. I wasn't overwhelmed by sadness the way I was when I read the story, and I didn't cry. I cried during the previews, though, when the trailer for the film about the guy swimming across the English Channel played. I also cried at the end of King Kong and I well knew that the monkey was going to die. So then maybe it's not that I read the story but that there's something wrong with the movie--that it keeps you at arms length. That's probably true, as the Ice Storm did the same thing. At least there the distance and chill made sense and worked wonderfully; Mikey sliding lifeless down the road is still arresting. In other words, this movie just doesn't work the way it's supposed to. That said, it's beautiful to look at, never dull, and slightly daring. As others have pointed out, the love story is straight forward--no pun intended. There's nothing that you can't find in Titanic or Romeo and Juliet. Except the doomed affair occurs between two men (oh wait, that totally happened in Romeo and Juliet, at least on the Elizabethan stage). That's nice that a major motion picture has taken the subject of same sex relationships on, and something for which we should praise the filmmakers. They do a nice job creating a convincing same-sex relationship, which is an accomplishment, seeing as how most gay characters in Hollywood films fall into some stereotype or another. The acting is uniformly excellent as well, though I'm not as surprised as some by the turn Heath Ledger gives. It reminded me of his role in Monster's Ball. He wasn't there for long, but I remember thinking that he had something special that you couldn't see in A Knight's Tale. He does something amazing here, as he takes the more masculine of the men but allows something distinctly feminine broil under the surface. I couldn't help but feel that though he was physically the top in this relationship, emotionally he was the bottom. Gyllenhaal was quite good as well, finally proving that he can branch out. Remember that year he played the same character twice--once in the Good Girl and the other time in Lovely and Amazing? I'm not knocking him, but he had seemingly cornered the market Tobey Maguire left behind to play Peter Parker. Anne Hathaway was also a knockout as Lureen. The way her early scenes of soft sensuality transformed into a brittle hardness are impressive.This is a good movie, though a disappointing one for me. A lot of others really seem to adore this picture, and I wonder if it derives from the unfamiliarity with the source material or if the film managed to affect them in the same way the story did me.",7,6,13,2 January 2006
Match Point," Do you feel guilty?
","Woody Allen is at the top of a short list for the title of greatest American director of the past 35 years. The man has produced quality films since the hilarity of Bananas in 1971, seemingly with ease. He's given us some duds (see 1980-1984 and 2000-2004), but his credentials are impeccable: Sleeper, Annie Hall, Manhattan, Interiors, Purple Rose of Cairo, Everyone Says I Love You, Sweet and Lowdown, Hannah and Her Sisters, Deconstructing Harry, Husbands and Wives, etc. And, when his films fall flat, they're nevertheless interesting. Like Robert Altman, he just seems to love making movies, regardless of their critical reception. As I said, Woody had hit the doldrums of late, producing intermittently funny films like Hollywood Ending and Small Time Crooks. To pompously quote Jeff Daniels in the Squid and the Whale, these are lesser Allen. Match Point is his best film since a string of brilliant gems during the mid- to late 1990s. It's terse, tragic, and darkly humorous; it's also a delicious slice of noir. Allen has made a movie like this (Crimes and Misdemeanors) but this slick little movie feels more lurid and more juicy. It's a potboiler that moves inexorably toward its conclusion like the finest fatalistic literature. Echoes of Dostoyevski and Strindberg are heard clearly throughout, but there are undercurrents here as well of Dreiser. To those who pick up on these leitmotifs and those who remember Crimes and Misdemeanors, the plot will not surprise, but do not worry. The characters are despicable (every single one) to varying degrees and the actors take to them with relish. Match Point is easily the best-acted Woody Allen film to come along since Sweet and Lowdown; I would argue that acting here trumps that in just about any Allen film not named Manhattan, Interiors, or Crimes and Misdemeanors. As Chris, Jonathan Rhys Meyers is a perfect cipher: beautiful, charming, and everything everyone wants him to be (he is, in that way, like a Tom Ripley). He also has a habit of allowing people to push him around, though he is far from spineless. Scarlett Johanson is no less stunning as Nola; sultry at first, the layers peel away to reveal an exceedingly emotional, unstable, and wounded woman. Her cries of liar near the end of the film are gutwrenchingly believable. Why else should you see Match Point? Well, there's the operatic soundtrack, which melds perfectly to the action on screen, and the photography, which is actually a presence in this film. Never known for a definable visual schema, Allen has had wonderfully photographed films (Manhattan, Interiors, and Crimes and Misdemeanors in particular); Match Point falls into that category. The framing Allen employs creates a sense of claustrophobia that encapsulates the characters appropriately. Not quite as great as Crimes and Misdemeanors, Match Point is a fantastic film that, I hope, will get Woody Allen back on track for another great run of films. I shouldn't be greedy and should be happy with his extant body of work, but I await his films each year with bated breath, knowing that the next jewel is just around the corner.",9,1,3,8 May 2006
Crash," Unfortunate
","I'm unsure how it happened, but Crash apparently duped the majority of film critics in America into thinking it was an extraordinary exploration of race and prejudice in America. I wholeheartedly disagree with anyone who thinks this movie deals intelligently with one of the problems that most plagues our country. You are entitled to your opinion, but I think you are wrong. Why has everyone been fooled? Roger Ebert recently named this his favorite movie of the year, and David Denby referred to it as the best American film since Mystic River. These are two of my favorite critics. Did I miss something? The rest of the IMDb community seems to think this a brilliant film as well. My one question: Why?Is it because here is a film that is well-made? The direction is steady; the acting is above average; you can relate to the characters; and it addresses an issue that Hollywood generally steers clear of. My assumption is that because this movie is well-done and chooses to look at subject matter one typically does not see on the big screen, everyone has ignored the film's major flaws--and there are a lot of them--because this is the type of movie you should like. Who wants to say they don't like the movie that deals directly with race in America? Who wants to incriminate themselves by saying that this movie just isn't as smart as everyone thinks it is? No one, really. I'm exaggerating, I think, as it appears Salon.com and the New York Times were smart enough to see that this emperor wasn't wearing any clothes. I saw this film when it was released on DVD and was very eager to watch it. I had heard wonderful things and had heard it compared to some of my favorite movies--Short Cuts, Magnolia, Nashville, etc. And, I thought, wow a movie that deals with racism in prejudice--we could really use one of those. It was horrible let down. First, I will address a technical problems with the film. My major complaint in this area derives from the film's length. It's far too short. There are too many characters to introduce and too short a time period to do them any justice. These are not, to go back to ninth grade, round characters at all. They're two-dimensional, which is, granted, better than one-dimensional, but, really, a far cry from the depth of character one typically finds in a great movie. All Haggis has time to do is show us how a character 'is' and then undermine or complicate that character's essence. So: (Remember how I said I included spoilers? Here are the big ones) the idealistic young cop who hates his racist partner and protects a black man whom his partner had wronged earlier kills an unarmed black youth and flees the scene. He's not a racist but his prejudices came to the surface and he shot someone. Oh my! The racist cop, on the other hand, shows real compassion for his sick father and rescues a woman he molested from a burning car. Holy cow he's complicated! The good black cop cannot remember the ethnicity of his maybe-girlfriend but he is such a good cop or is he? He does let exonerating evidence disappear so that the DA can get points with the black community. Man, these people are so deep! No, they are not. Some are more developed than others (Matt Dillon and Don Cheadle's characters, for instance), but they never come truly alive. Haggis simply has far too many other characters he wants to be central to the story to accomplish that. That's a major flaw of this film as a film. How can anyone ignore that? How can discerning viewers watch Crash and compare it to the three-hour behemoths Short Cuts and Magnolia, where the characters are given time to flower and grow? Really, did I see the abridged version of Crash?Then there's the general uninspired-ness of the film. The cinematography is banal and the direction, which is passable, certainly leaves something to be desired. It's not bad, per se, but it is mediocre--never better than average. How can this be a great movie then?Those are technical matters, though, that one can overlook when a film has something important to say. Look at Boyz in the Hood, which was not really well done, but it had an urgent message that affects its audience viscerally. It somehow rises above itself and some of its immature trappings. The same thing goes with Better Luck Tomorrow. Crash, though, has nothing important to say. Or am I supposed to think that 'we're all prejudiced on some level' is a profound sentiment? Because I don't. I know that's true. Why? Because I've despised people at a glance simply because they wear shirts with their collars popped only to find out that, well, they're really all right. And because a group of teenagers wearing studded dog collars in a park will still cause me to go out of my way just so I won't have to walk by them. Who hasn't had thoughts like this? If you haven't, you're a saint. Crash doesn't delve into the problem of race in America. It pretends to but barely scratches the surface. It has a facile understanding of race in America; it understands it no better than I do. We need art to show us alternatives and show us paths to a better world--something that Crash is incapable of doing.I am very hostile towards this film, if you couldn't tell. Why is that? It's not a bad movie, really. It's simply that it has been afforded some privilege that it doesn't quite earn. It's been deemed great by many because it is an atypical Hollywood film that is done well. That does not make it a great or important film. It makes it an average one at best.",5,3,7,28 December 2005
The Grapes of Wrath," Wherever they're showing the Grapes of Wrath, that's where I'll be
","Do I have your attention? Okay: Go out and watch this movie immediately because to not do so is, well, it's un-American. John Ford, with this nifty little film, made the greatest argument for populist/socialist politics in cinematic history. This movie understands the Depression and the Dust Bowl and the poor and the hungry and the starving and all those people that the sign at Ellis Island (or is it at the Statue of Liberty?) says that we'll take on and help. It understands those people better than anyone or anything else I know. Steinbeck's novel helps this movie get to where it needs to be, but, let's be honest, the Grapes of Wrath is all John Ford. The sweeping vistas, the excellent editing and pacing, and the acting are of the highest caliber, as befits a John Ford film. I'm amazed every time I see this movie just how moving it is without straying into trite sentimentality. Tom Joad's speech at the end always makes me cry--his chilly delivery of the word homicide at the beginning continues to give me a prickly spine. Fonda was a great actor, and he is certainly at the top of his game here. Without him, interestingly, the film would have probably floundered. No one else could have possibly played Tom Joad; no one would have that charm and charisma and, most importantly, that voice. The rest of the cast is amazing, don't misunderstand, but Henry Fonda is Henry Fonda--an actor unto himself. There is no one like him and never will there be; he is the single most watchable actor of all time. And this isn't even my favorite John Ford movie! Nevertheless, it's a great film with a great message. Call me a pinko (it's been done before), but what's superb about this movie is its humanism. Yeah, the ideology promotes a type of socialism (ahem, I mean, let's not forget that that is basically what the New Deal was and if you think that system was a bad idea, then fine), but, really, the movie is about caring for people who don't have the resources to care for themselves. Grapes of Wrath is not a scathing indictment of anyone; it's a simple portrait of a family's struggles to overcome the Depression. It's uplifting and shows a real feeling for the downtrodden, and that's more than you can say about most American films that intend to deal with the poor and hungry.",10,17,21,2 April 2006
American Psycho," Sussudio
","There are at least ten reasons why you should watch this wonderful, macabre movie:10) Justin Theroux is in the movie and he went to Bennington. So did Bret Easton Ellis, who you undoubtedly know wrote the book this movie is based on, but they didn't attend at the same time. That's okay though because I just like that a Bennington alumnus starred in a film based on a book by another alumnus. That and I think Theroux can be talented when working with a decent director, as he does here. 9) They kill Jared Leto's character. Any movie that does that gets at least an additional two stars. It can make a mediocre movie into something I would describe as 'a good way to spend two hours' (Panic Room, I'm looking at you). 8) The book is pretty much unreadable, to me, and not because of its gore (though there's some rough stuff there); it's just boring and the pages and pages and pages about Huey Lewis really aren't that fascinating to anyone other than BEE. 7) The obligatory defusing of misogyny: It was made by a woman! The Patrick Bateman character kills women (grusomely)! So it's okay! I'm not sure I buy that line of reasoning. Frankly, the violence against women here is appropriate because, duh, we're not supposed to like Patrick Bateman. We're supposed to see him as a product of his deluded times. We're supposed to understand that he's either become unhinged as a result of contemporary impersonality or he's a monster because of that impersonality. 6) Willem Defoe's performance as an inept version of Columbo (who was inept enough as it was) is brilliant. 5) The film is delirious, completely. It moves fast and, in a lot of ways, seems as insane as its anti-protagonist. However, it never feels that it's out of control; you know all the time that the filmmakers know how crazy, absurd, and darkly funny the material and performances are. It's almost like some gruesome, EC comic from the 1950s. That's a compliment. 4) Reese Witherspoon3) Remember how I complained about pages upon pages in the book that expound upon the virtues of Phil Collins and Huey Lewis? Here they work because their shorter and, frankly, they're visual jokes, ultimately. Who knew it was funnier to actually watch a deranged psychopath go after someone with an ax while discussing Sussudio?2) Christian Bale proves yet again that he needs more work. I'm glad he's getting more of it now, but I think those of us that saw this and Velvet Goldmine were wondering why we weren't seeing more of him. 1) It's just a very very good movie that many people will find enjoyable. Unless they dislike bloodshed, in which case they should stay away.",10,3,6,19 March 2006
Underground," Farcical Phantasmagoria of Yugoslavian History
","Underground is the greatest film of the 1990s and, potentially, the greatest film of the last 25 years. It's terribly funny but ultimately heartbreaking and, yes, it's about war. In fact, it's among the greatest war films ever conceived.The film follows Marko and Petar, small-time Communist gun-runners in pre-WWII Belgrade. The movie opens as they drunkenly make-off with an arms-cache to the tune of a gypsy band. The next day, their city is destroyed and the animals have escaped from the zoo, metaphorically and literally. With their families, Marko and Petar escape underground to Marko's uncle's cellar where they intend to wait out the war. The war stops, but Marko fools the cellar-dwellers into thinking that the war rages on and enlists their help in building guns. Of course, those living in the cellar eventually learn the truth.With this movie, Kusturica created a hermetic world that is witty, farcical, surreal, and ultimately sublime. The photography is stunning and Kusturica's shot-composition is painterly. Underground is an amazing work of art, one that should be treasured not only for its cinematic value but for its cultural and historical values as well.",10,4,9,20 February 2007
Velvet Goldmine," Funtime
","I ignored this movie upon its release due, solely, to Roger Ebert's assertion that David Bowie deserves better. I regret my decision to avoid Velvet Goldmine for so long because, frankly, David Bowie doesn't deserve to have a movie made about him. Do not misunderstand: I love the Thin White Duke, Ziggy, and A Lad Insane, but, frankly, his life is probably not interesting enough to recreate on screen. HOWEVER, a fictionalized version of that life, amalgamated with the lives of similar rock stars and taken to the most imaginative limits, is worth it. It's totally enthralling and utterly breathtaking, and, from one point of view, wholly faithful, if not deferential, to Mr. Bowie. Plus, by eschewing reality to a certain extent, Todd Haynes can make the movie he wants rather than bend his ideals to a real life. So, basically, I avoided one of the most brilliant movies of the last 15 years based on a single point of view. As much as I value Mr. Ebert's opinion, he was sorely mistaken when it comes to Velvet Goldmine. His gravest error? That would be thinking this movie is supposed to be about David Bowie. Yes, to a certain extent it is. Brian Slade is, very much, an emulation of that man. Maxwell Demon is analogous to Ziggy Stardust; his bouts with cocaine addiction are comparable to Bowie's mid- to late 1970s travails as well. Curt Wild can stand in for Iggy Pop, whom David Bowie helped during his glammy hey-day (he produced, horribly, the Stooges final studio record, Raw Power). BUT not everything adds up, nor is it supposed to. Brian Slade is a melange of everyone from David Bowie to Marc Bolan to Brian Eno to Brian Ferry to David Johanson to... Curt Wild calls to mind Iggy Pop, clearly, but he's more sensitive and with stringy blond hair that clearly recalls Curt Cobain. Jack Fairy could be Brian Ferry or Marc Bolan or Andy Warhol. The fact is that everyone is everyone, on some level. They're all mixed up and they're supposed to be. The movie isn't about people, but rather about a movement, which these people happen to demonstrate. The movie is about the abandonment of the pansexuality embraced by glitter. Those who rode the glam wave--who supported being gay or bisexual--made an about face. Brian Slade, in the film, becomes the straight man, pun intended--the lackey of a fascist government in an alternate 1984. Isn't that, sort of, what glam did? Didn't the ambiguous Bowie become the Iman's husband and bury his make-up and dress wearing ways in favor of making in extremely lucrative, but artistically vapid, records? Didn't Marc Bolan sputter out in a ball of cocaine? Didn't David Johanson, the gorgeous man/woman on the cover of the NY Dolls first record become Buster Poindexter? Didn't Brian Ferry choose to become a lounge singer? Didn't Brian Eno choose to... Well, no Brian Eno didn't change so much as remain weird in a different way. In any event, like Curt Wild says in the film, not everyone who says they're bisexual is; they're just doing it because they think it's cool. Velvet Goldmine is Todd Haynes's slap in the face of those artists who abandoned a truly challenging path for something a little less curvy. Of course, it's not just the weighted ideology of the film that's brilliant. It's also the colors and the acting and the atmosphere. This movie is candy colored and wonderful to look at. It feels like Alladin Sane or The Slider sounds. It's like ingesting the warm jets. It's glam. And the acting's top-notch too. This is, quite simply, a splendid motion picture with quite a bit to say about artistic backtracking. It's just great.",10,11,16,23 January 2006
The Man Who Would Be King," Adventure! Excitement! Exotic Locales! You too can experience these in the Queen's Army!
","My friend threw this DVD at my head one night while we were arguing about film. I said all adventure movies left me feeling a little hollow - adventure movies tended to abandon story, really, in favor of plot (important distinction: stories are interesting, plots boring; consequently a film with a story to tell is better than a movie with a plot to move forward). I think he hurled the disc at me out of pure frustration with my point of view. In doing so, he also won the argument.The Man Who Would Be King is the single greatest adventure film I've ever seen. It's a story - It's a tale - It's not a series of plot developments (to me, to go further with this plot/story dichotomy, a plot is mechanical (and sometimes that machine is well-oiled) while a story is organic and feels less contrived (though the story, as organic matter sometimes is, can be rotten)). It's a very good story at that. The Man Who Would Be King (I believe as a result of its derivation from Kipling) has a depth and development of character that is foreign to most adventure tales. Few films are as rousing as this and few films that are this rousing have nearly as much to say about mankind.John Huston, of course, is a master of instilling greatness into traditionally tedious genres. He transformed the mystery, the western, the swashbuckler. Why not the adventure story too? As evidenced in The Maltese Falcon and Treasure of the Sierra Madre, Huston can take what might wind up a plot and transform it into a story. He understands that characters - human, conflicted, devious characters - are essential to creating genre pictures that transcend their genre. Without Huston, this film would have undoubtedly faltered; his steady and determined hand guides this film from the hazards of superficiality without sacrificing entertainment and adventure.He does not create a great film single-handedly though, as Connery and Caine, who both give tremendous performances, bestow upon Peachy and Daniel immense likability despite their scoundrel airs. Caine proves again why he may be the greatest living British actor and Connery reminds us that there's more to him than 007.As I said, this is one of the greatest adventure tales brought to the screen. Though some may disagree, in particular my friend who threw the DVD at my head, it's better than any of the late 30s swashbucklers and better than most shoot-em-ups made since.",Null,55,75,29 November 2004
Ghostbusters," Yes, it's true. This film is wonderful.
","It's been a long time, Ghostbusters. You and me go way back, though, don't we? 1985 was it? I watched you while I lay upon the floor. I still remember hiding under the blanket when the Marshmallow Man beat hell out of NYC. It was those demon dogs that really did me in, though. When they came at Sigourney through the chair? So scary. You're not so scary now. Now you're funny, just like you were then. Where do these stairs go? They go up. So funny. Rick Moranis? Hysterical, him with his mineral water. And Venkman's still the best - always was, always will be. Egon and Ray, don't take it personally, you just can't compare. Really, it's like asking Dan Ackroyd and Harold Ramis to be funnier than Bill Murray. It'd never happen. So it's been almost 20 years since we met...amazing. Sis got you for me when I was 8 - bought you used at a video store near her college. I played the hell out of you, but you're still mine. A little worse for wear, but I can still watch you.Watched you last week, in fact, with the nephews. They'd never seen you - a little to young to remember how big you were once. My friends and I, though, we remember you well. We all have you in our collection. My nephews though, they loved you. Eleven and nine, a little older than I was at our introduction, but they enjoyed you the same. Why? Because you're funny and funny doesn't get old. I laughed at you when I was five and I'll laugh at you when I'm sixty-five. Ghostbusters, you're great. I hope I never forget you.",Null,0,0,29 November 2004
Hero," Empty Spaces
","Hero revels in wide open spaces; for the most part these are empty spaces, upon which the director can paint his vision. Or, rather, I should say his visions. In that way, Hero acts visually as those sand-boxes upon which calligraphy students practice their art. On a narrative level, calligraphy also serves as a useful point of reference - the 19 ways to write sword paralleling the Rashomon-like story.Unfortunately, despite the glut of ideas concerning politics (conquest as a unifying force), love (its sublime nature), and art (its ephemerality) among others the film lacks a center. It is un-focused and much like the landscapes depicted herein empty.Hero has no soul.Soul is, of course, intangible; yet the audience, if trained, can perceive it or the lack thereof. With its gorgeously composed and thematically colored shots, Hero lulls us with its beauty.Unfortunately, after a half hour we realize that, really, despite its ideological ramifications, there is nothing more to this film than surface.A beautiful and stylish surface can work, as it does in the work of De Palma, on its own to give the movie its soul. De Palma understands that (and so do other directors like Kurosawa, Tarantino to an extent, and Hitchcock). These directors understand that it is not what a movie is about, but rather how it is about it.Style is important, then.Yimou Zhang fails in that respect. Hero is not about style; it is about visuals. These are two distinct entities. Style encompasses mood, visuals, atmosphere, acting, direction, etc. Style is the whole package. Hero has the visuals, but lacks in every other category. The performances are wooden; the direction is static.The imaging of this world is beautiful, but, on its own, that cannot carry the film.Look at Kurosawa, who stylizes his pictures to perfection. Look at Kobayashi and Shinoda. These men meld a painterly visual sense with appropriate atmosphere, stylized acting, and impeccable direction. Watch Kwaidan, Ran, Hara-kiri, or Double Suicide and then watch Hero. The lack of soul will be apparent in the latter and so will the lack of skill.**Note: I saw the extended Chinese version of this film, thanks to a brother with an exuberant love of all things Asian; that film, at almost and hour and fifty minutes was tedious. The American version, cut to almost an hour and a half is probably a better movie but my criticisms would still stand, I think. Slimming the film down will not give it a center and focus it.",Null,1,2,13 November 2004
Garden State," Enjoyable Mediocrity
","I'll be honest. I did not want to like Garden State. I held it at arms length because it seemed, from the previews and gushing reviews by scenesters, like it was trying a little too hard to be cool. I don't like movies that try to be cool (Pi, for instance); I like movies that are cool.Anyway, I went to see it anyway, hadn't seen anything in a while and figured it was my best bet at the local theaters. Did I dislike it? Not really, Garden State is enjoyable, even if it drags in parts. Did I like it? Not really. The movie simply left me ambivalent. The experience of watching Zach Braff and Natalie Portman fight their personal demons and find true love was not painful, nor was it revelatory. It was a nice enough way to spend a couple hours, but I could devise both better and worse ways to spend that time. So, yes, Garden State is an enjoyable flick that really had no staying power in my mind. This films differs from, say, Kill Bill or A Home at the End of the World, to use two new examples, in that respect; those movies remained in my brain for days as I picked them apart. I left the theater after seeing them and I felt that I had experienced something. They affected me bodily. Garden State did not. It is enjoyable mediocrity.Why? The quirks in this film give it appeal that most romantic comedies lack; they make the story interesting (had they been left out Garden State would have been a very bad movie). I find that interesting inasmuch as I dreaded the quirks. I thought quirks meant the story was trying to hard to be 'different' and 'hip.' Turns out, the more surreal moments are woven organically into the film; they do not sit out like sore thumbs. They make sense in the context of the movie.Natalie Portman also makes the movie more enjoyable that it would have been without her. She is an angel and, in a quasi-reprise of her role in Beautiful Girls, she won my heart again. I'd given up hope on her and Garden State showed me again why I loved her in the first place.That said, the rest of the movie is less compelling. Zach Braff is rather un-interesting in the lead, but I have to give him credit for getting Portman to play his love interest. If it worked for him, there's hope for the rest of us. The story, on the whole, is also lack-luster.It's un-original and, for my tastes, strangely derivative of Rick Moody's completely un-related novel. (It's interesting that the movie and book have nothing to do with one another, yet they both have the same name and are about 20-somethings with mental health problems. Either young head cases are common to New Jersey or Braff decided to write his own narratively dissimilar but tonally similar version of Moody's novel). The movie also under-uses Ian Holm, a terrific actor who should be allowed more range than is given him here.Again, Garden State is not terrible, nor is it good. It is so middle of the road, it might as well be a set of parallel yellow lines.",Null,1,2,9 November 2004
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Sigh...
","When they announced the Academy Award nominations this year, I has seen all but one of the best picture nominees--Good Night and Good Luck. Of the other four, the only one that seemed deserving of its nod was Munich. Crash was far to simple-minded for my taste (please, go see Do the Right Thing if you want to see a movie that deals intelligently with race in America), and, as a huge supporter of Annie Proulx's Brokeback Mountain, I was let down by Ang Lee's translation; Capote was a lot better than I anticipated, but it was not one of the five best pictures released in 2005. Having seen the trailers for, read the reviews about, and listened to my Hollywood friend expound on the virtues of Good Night and Good Luck, I assumed that I would be immediately drawn to the movie. I like George Clooney and adore David Strathairn; the topic was interesting; the cinematography looked fantastic. Well, I was enormously let down. The direction was solid and the cinematography was brilliant. The acting was very good as well. However, I'd argue the movie fails on the level of its writing. Given what the screenwriters offered him to work with, Strathairn does an amazing job. There are no speeches given by Murrow in this film that would indicate what type of person he was--nothing to indicate that, while taking on McCarthy, he had second thoughts. Strathairn creates that lack of sureness. Yet that's not enough to create what I would consider a complete character. Murrow feels flat throughout, through no fault of Mr. Strathairn, I think. He just wasn't given nearly enough to work with. Perhaps that was the point to keep Murrow an enigma, but I don't know if I feel it was a good choice. In any event, I simply felt that there was something missing.I also felt that the film presents a VERY biased view of history. Not that the film is wrong to elevate Murrow above McCarthy. Sen. McCarthy was a no-good, opportunistic, lout; whenever I see the Dead Zone, I am pretty sure Martin Sheen modeled his character on Minnesota's former-junior senator. What I take a critical view of is the fact that they present McCarthy's downfall as more or less the result of Murrow's taking easy potshots at him. It seems too facile to argue that Murrow brought down McCarthy and even in the movie it feels a little false. History is never that simple. It's complicated and convoluted and the straw that breaks the camel's back is seldom the only straw on the camel's back. This is not a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination, and I might have had a different opinion of it had I not expected unrivaled brilliance. I was awaiting and expecting greatness, but I did not get it.",7,2,4,19 March 2006
Mulholland Drive," Superb
","A lot of people love David Lynch. I count myself among that group. However, I am not an uncritical supporter of this man's oeuvre. I can say, without fear of censure, that Blue Velvet, Wild At Heart, the Straight Story, and Mulholland Drive are unrivaled masterpieces. The others are lesser films--Eraserhead is, though an auspicious debut, immature; Elephant Man is dull; Dune is lugubrious; and Lost Highway is an abomination and one of the worst films I've ever seen. Blue Velvet and Mulholland are two of the best films I've ever seen-- Mulholland in particular. What's wonderful about this film? Everything. I saw it the first time at the Cork Film Festival in 2001, just after it opened in the states. The screen was huge and the theatre dark. When those joyriders come screeching down through the Hollywood Hills, I knew I was in for something special. I can't say that I completely understood everything the first time I saw Mulholland, but I grasped most of what was going one. To those that say this film is too confusing, I say you're not paying close enough attention and by that I mean you must have fallen asleep for part of it. The movie really isn't that difficult to follow, ultimately, unless you've never seen a movie with a dream sequence or a flashback or an out of sequence narrative. Show of hands: How many of you have seen Pulp Fiction? If you've seen that film, you can follow this one. I'm not going to explain what I think happened because ultimately it doesn't matter. The world Lynch creates in this film is amazing and complete. It's a comic book-Los Angeles or one from another dimension. It's a fantasy-land. You have to lose yourself in it and be taken over by the tone of the film and its imagery. If you do that, the film will guide you through its more opaque convolutions. The acting, cinematography, and overall mood are amazing here and this is probably Lynch's most assured film (if not my favorite). However, it's a terrible place to start, if you're unfamiliar with him. Start with The Straight Story (his most mature film) and move onto Blue Velvet (my personal favorite but a very raw film). Then, you'll probably be ready for Mulholland.",10,2,5,31 March 2006
Caddyshack," All Roads
","So Caddyshack is several of the funniest movies ever. It's a half-dozen characters each with their own story (sometimes the stories overlap) occupying the same celluloid. It's really a very interesting narrative strategy. I'd call it avant garde, except it was written by Harold Ramis, therefore making such a statement absurd. It's Chevy Chase's finest hour (so dry he might as well be a desert, his humor so sly you miss half his jokes) and Bill Murray's no slouch either (did he improvise the Cinderella story bit or was it written like that? was his part written at all or was he allowed to be as lewd and retarded as he wanted to be?). Oh, and then there's Rodney, the funniest guy in the film. He walks on, completely in charge of himself and his jokes and completely slays. He's not debonair, like Chase, nor is he, like Murray, a buffoon - he's simply hilarious. (Actually, Murray might be funnier, but Dangerfield is so garish and unreserved that it's fantastic). Caddyshack isn't great, as a whole, but it has tremendously funny characters; it's a thoroughly enjoyable way to spend an evening.",Null,1,1,12 January 2005
2001: A Space Odyssey," Kubrick's Magnum Opus
","I used to love Stanley Kubrick - thought he was the greatest director in the world. Every film he had done was gold, in my eyes, and impervious to any criticisms leveled against them. Those were notions through the filter of adolescence. Fairly often, as we grow older, we grow away from those things that appeal to us as teenagers and rightly so, for aren't teenagers incompletely formed adults? Yes, they are and so their tastes will not yet be fully matured as well.Watching most of Stanley Kubricks work with an older mind and aged eyes, I find myself disappointed more often than not. This man that once thought A Clockwork Orange to be pushing the limits of cinema now finds it an exploitative mess that completely loses sight of what its satire attempts to bring down. Its violence and violent sex titillate the audience (that would be why I adored it as a teenager) - they don't ask us to question the images on scree and that's, actually, dangerous film-making. That and Clockwork is, visually, very unimpressive. Those of you taken aback by the photographic brilliance of his other films are bound to be let down.Age does not favor Kubrick's other films as well - Full Metal Jacket (has been and always will be half a great movie), Spartacus (beautiful but ultimately lifeless), and the Shining (bo-ring) have not stood my test of time. Strangelove is still funny and Barry Lyndon a solid bit of film, but best of all continues to be 2001: A Space Odyssey.Certainly, it's an abtruse and esoteric film, but it's also beautiful, puzzling, and brilliant on a thematic level. It is, perhaps, the greatest exploration of science fictive ideals in the history of film; it's certainly the most intelligent. And did I mention that it's visually stunning? The stylization of the prehistoric era, as well as the attention to minutiae in the future scenes, are impeccable. Kubrick had an amazing vision and, using the limited resources afforded directors in 1968, he achieved it. This is one of the most visually arresting films ever made.The story itself is negligible (it's interesting, involving mankind's repeated encounters with strange, black monolithic rocks that those rocks relation to our evolution), but it's there. As someone said, though, a movie is not about the plot, it's how it is about the plot. The how, in 2001, as I have said, is amazingly beautiful. The images are beautiful and the tone claustrophobic. It's like watching a painting move.And yet it is not just a visual experience for the audience. It's a sonic and emotive experience as well. The grating classical score that accompanies encounters with the monolith, for example, is the greatest use of music in a film and the use of Strauss' ballet for the docking sequence is a stroke of genius. Furthermore, this film, and the tension Kubrick builds with the sparest plot imaginable, drain the audience. Watching 2001physically drains you. See it on a big screen (one of the 5 greatest movie moments in my life) and you'll see what I'm talking about.2001: A Space Odyssey is one of the greatest motion pictures of all time and should be required viewing of everyone. It's intelligent, beautiful, and visceral. I can't think of any other film that has those qualities in such abundance. Watch it tomorrow, please.",Null,1,5,21 November 2004
The Fly," Choice Casting
","Everyone knows the story--brilliant scientist creates amazing invention (teleporter!) and, in testing it, merges himself with a fly that, unbeknown to him, zips about his second telepod. What follows that mishap could best be described as degeneration, as Seth Brundle, the scientist, becomes Brundlefly. Obviously, though, the movie was made by David Cronenberg, master of venereal or bio- horror. He loves exploring the body and the many ways it disintegrates or morphs; he loves making audiences squeamish with glistening viscera that serve a higher, more philosophical purpose. If Rabid was about STDs, then the Fly is about love in the face of decay. Reading into the story too much would be reductive--The Fly isn't about watching Brundle die from any particular disease; it's about watching Veronica helplessly stand witness to her lover's slow, unalterable demise. It might also be leftfield, allegorical support for euthanasia, but I'm more inclined to believe that the ending resulted from the necessity of a tidy narrative than it did from Cronenberg's desire to include an encrypted message. But is it any good? Yes, it is. The Fly works on the level of symbolism, but it's also an enjoyable and frightening horror film. It's got the gore and the scares, but it's also intelligent. The Fly is a brilliant commercial horror movie inasmuch as it manages to stay true to the director's vision, while also delivering what audiences expect from a scary movie. It's also wonderfully shot and acted (Jeff Goldblum already looked like an insect; Cronenberg got him to act like one as well). With The Fly Cronenberg also achieved something few directors could--he made a remake better than the original. The Fly from the 1950s was fine, but it wasn't really that frightening; it's actually a little silly. Cronenberg rewrote the script and turned the earlier film on its ear. This Fly is scary, smart, and, unlike most of Cronenberg's films, lacking in gallows humor; it's actually among his more serious endeavors. The Fly is a fantastic piece of film-making that should appeal to those in the mood for a taut horror flick or an intelligent, though coded, exploration of an interesting idea.",10,1,2,8 April 2006

When it comes to philosophies or preferences, we're not static creatures because we realize obstinance is not a virtue. We change, we evolve - that is to be human.Well, my opinion of Pulp Fiction has underwent several cataclysmic upheavals since I first saw the film in its year of release, 1994. I was 14 and, without exaggerating, Pulp Fiction shattered my concept of film. I'd never been so excited, intrigued and in love with a film. It forced me to reconsider what quality cinema was - it was no longer just the greats, the Best Picture winners, etc. Great cinema could be anything - old gangster movies, film noir, B-horror flicks, 1950s melodrama. The film also prompted me to explore film on a more academic basis, as I began reading film theory and film criticism regularly.I worshiped at the shrine of Tarantino and watched everything he put his hands on - be that Destiny Turns on the Radio or 4 Rooms.His other work (even Reservoir Dogs, which, I am convinced, is nothing more than a decent first film) disappointed me, but I never once second-guessed Pulp Fiction. Jackie Brown in 1997 re-affirmed my faith in the man, but then he disappeared and a funny thing happened, I second guessed Pulp Fiction.The dialogue, which I once thought brilliant, was not stilted and forced - a little too hip for its own good. The acting was all right, but seemed weaker than I remembered, and the once brilliant story became trite. The masterpiece became, in my eyes, pretentious, though still watchable fare. On my list of 100 favorite films, it fell from the top-10 to the upper 70s.Years went by, I continually found myself drawn to Jackie Brown (I think it's Tarantino's most mature wok and a wrongfully maligned masterpiece), but I avoided Pulp Fiction. A friend who had never seen the film asked one day if we could throw my copy on and it was like watching it for the first time.Everything that seemed forced or trite was brilliant. The dialogue that seemed overly stylized now seemed perfectly stylized and, really, perfectly at odds with the plot, which, though it contains recycled elements, became an energetic, hyper-kinetic, and amazing narrative again.Pulp Fiction quickly returned to the top of my favorites list. Why the swift rising and falling? I have no idea. It could be that QT created a film that is so tied to its audience's state of mind that their reaction to it is a complete crap shoot for him. That's doubtful. What I think truly happened is this: my adolescent mind reacted to its pop-culture references and its manic pace. It was hip and cool, really, and therefore perfect for your alterna teenagers. I matured, grew disdainful of things hip and cool (it was obviously cooler to dislike things that were cool right?), and so began disliking PF. I grew up a little more, became a little more perceptive, and therefore able to appreciate exactly what QT does with narrative and dialogue. Pulp Fiction, though this may seem odd, is a very subtle movie. Its brilliance at first seems superficial, but dig a little deeper and you'll find a film that is narratively amazing and that carries emotional weight. It's not all style; it's not just hip. It's an intelligent and wonderful movie and I don't think that I'll change my mind on it again.",7,4,10,22 November 2004
A Beautiful Mind," Happier Days Indeed
","I really love Happy Days. There's something about Richie, Pottsie, Malph, the Fonze, and all the Cunninghams that just causes all of my aversions to sugar-coated Americana switch off. I cannot tolerate the Brady Bunch, Leave It to Beaver, Full House, etc, but a half-hour of Happy Days is pure television genius. I can't really explain why this is, but I surmise that I've always detected that, on some level, Happy Days didn't believe the myths it spun. It understood that the era it depicted was not all peaches and cream; there was something dark underneath all those episodes.Those other shows, those happy-family sit-coms, seem to believe their mythic landscapes and I cannot abide them for that. Or something.Well, as you all know, little Richie grew up and became a reasonably successful film director and produced, among others, A Beautiful Mind. And, man, does it make me yearn for Happy Days.I'm not entirely sure why this film has been un-necessarily given the title of genius. It's really just another Hollywood bio-pic and, if I'm not mistaken, there have been very few of those that were worthwhile (Ed Wood, for example, or Baadasssss! or Auto Focus). Nevertheless, come February and March, they take home all sorts of little gold statuettes.Russell Crowe offers another fine (though not Best Actor nomination worthy) performance as John Nash, schizophrenic genius extraordinaire, while Ed Harris proves again that he should receive more leading roles. He's one of the few character actors left in Hollywood who can waltz into any movie and instantly improve the film's quality. He was by far the finest point in the Hours and he's equally excellent here, yet again supplying the high-point in an otherwise mediocre movie (Truman Show and the aforementioned Hours anyone?). The remaining performances struck me as rather bland, as did the direction, and score.The only other bright spot for me were occasional flashes of cinematographic brilliance supplied by Mr. Roger Deakins, who, though not at the top of his game, provided us with something better, at least, than his nadir thus far - O Brother Where Art Thou.To be honest, though John Nash is certainly an important figure and has provided many important discoveries, I seriously question the need to give him his own film. Most great bio-pics serve a higher purpose than to worship the life they depict, offering the audience insight into something other than a so-called genius. A Beautiful Mind strives to do this, providing us with a glimpse into the world of mental illness, but ultimately the movie fails in this.The movie ultimately is not about schizophrenia; it's about John Nash. I like my bio-pics the other way around; I like them to be about something and not about an individual or group (take Ed Wood, for example - a film not about one of the most interesting Hollywood figures, but rather about the under-side of Hollywood - the B-picture and the effects of Hollywood upon the stars it made famous and threw away) All in all, this was a mediocre film, not worth the attention it received and certainly not worth the $9 I gave them to see it in the theaters.

Jaws," Great Fun
","A lot of people write off Steven Spielberg because of his commercial success, and, frankly, that's too bad. While it's true that much commercial film-making is pap, there are also filmic artists who can also deliver slambang entertainment. Steven Spielberg is the master of contemporary artful entertainment, counting the likes of John Frankenheimer and Alfred Hitchcock among his cinematic forefathers.Jaws initiated that spell between the mid-1970s and early 1980s when, seemingly, Spielberg could do no wrong (well, except 1941). He had shown a sure hand and a feel for thrills in Duel, but nothing prepared audiences for the brilliance of Jaws. Everything in Jaws falls into the correct place and, even though it pales in comparison to the maturity of vision in ET and Close Encounters, it's likely one of the greatest action- adventure films you're likely to encounter.What I think separates Jaws from its imitators and from lesser action films is its unwillingness to abide by conventions. Eschewing the lax characterization inherent in most thrillers, Jaws makes sure we understand the three leads, while never offering up scenes that serve only to establish character. Nearly every scene that allows us to delve a little deeper into Quint or Hooper also advances the plot (though I would argue it does so imperceptibly). The film moves like the shark--smoothly and forward. Even what appear to be divergences come around to forward momentum by their end. Take the scene in which the men compare scars: here we learn quite a bit about Quint and, at first, it seems that's the scene's entire purpose, but then the shark returns and damages the boat. Most scenes in this film operate in a similar manner. It's a basic screen writing concept, but one that keeps Jaws fresh with character insights and action.Then there's also Spielberg's decision to postpone the visual arrival of the star for nearly an hour. People may have come to this film to see a shark, but instead they found a couple glimpses of fin in an otherwise land-based drama. Most movies of this sort put off the monster's arrival but precious few postpone it for so long. The story is enough to carry this movie--the relative success or failure of the film does not rest on the back of the shark. Think about it this way--Spielberg creates such a fascinating story about a shark without actually showing us the fish that, when we finally see the entire thing, we're amazed, but it doesn't really matter because we're entirely hooked already. That's impressive and admirable. Since Jaws, Spielberg has gone on to make better films, but his greatness manifested itself here first. Jaws is a superb film and superb entertainment.",9,1,3,4 March 2006
Halloween," Frightening
","I first saw John Carpenter's Halloween on television as a ten-year old. I had been left alone by my parents for the afternoon and, scanning the channels, I came across the scariest music I've ever heard. I did what every ten-year old would; I sat there and watched every last bit of it.Scared, terrified, afraid, etc. Those were my feelings as I sat there watching a seemingly supernatural madman slash teenagers.The movie wasn't gory, really, but my mind, racing, supplied many gallons of blood and numerous flesh wounds.Watching Halloween now, I'm so very impressed that it still has the ability to prickle my skin and give me enough heebies that I have to run from the living room to my bedroom after watching it.But why is Halloween so frightening? Certainly part of its horror derives from the hulking, evil Michael Myers, but other movies, like Nightmare on Elm Street or Friday the 13th, have similar monsters and lack Halloween's ability to terrify absolutely. What truly makes Halloween scary is it's appearance. It looks real. The cinematography and direction feel more like cinema verite than most horror movies (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre has a similar feel). The 'realistic feel' does not seem contrived (as it did in Blair Witch) nor does it feel forced (as it did in Night of the Living Dead (an excellent movie, but please let's be honest - that movie's realism felt like the result of fiduciary limitations.) It feels like the director wanted to shoot the movie in exactly that way.John Carpenter has not topped himself, but he should still be remembered for making one of the finest and one of the few perfect horror movies.",10,0,1,31 October 2004
The Producers," I'm in pain and I'm wet
","Behold: the auspicious beginnings of an otherwise overrated career!The Producers, a funny enough depiction of some smarmy individuals, is only half the film it's said to be. Growing up I would hear of this film through older siblings and older family friends. Genius, they called it. Roger Ebert and Leonard Maltin agreed, and, at the tender age of 14, I was impressionable. My hopes were set pretty high, so I guess I shouldn't be surprised that I was completely let down. My 14 year-old self said: 'This is supposed to be better than Young Frankenstein? Really?' I thought Mssrs. Ebert and Maltin were yanking my chain. It was amusing in fits and starts, and Gene Wilder, as always, was wonderful, but... Where were the belly laughs? Where was the offending material? The film follows Max Bialystock, a washed-up Broadway producer, who hits upon a scheme with wallflower accountant Leo Bloom that will fleece rich old women of their fortunes as they (the old women) fund a sure-fire flop--'Springtime for Hitler.' It's a clever plot for a comedy, especially for a comedy produced in the late 1960s, but the humor is dated methinks. In 1968, the film might have been outrageous; today, it seems tame. It's still amusing and there's a chuckle here and there, but it doesn't hold up next to Young Frankenstein, a vastly superior comedy by Mr. Brooks. I appreciate Mel's attempts to integrate allusions to Modernist fiction (Joyce and Kafka make appearances sort of) into a film reveling in adolescent humor, but I think it needs to take its humor an additional step. The musical numbers in Springtime still evoke a hearty laugh, but the buxom Ulla, well, isn't funny. Bialystock's trysts with old women seem quaint these days too. What Brooks once described as rising below vulgarity doesn't seem vulgar at all to these younger and, perhaps, more jaded eyes (and don't get me started on that Brooks quote--it's not clever but condescending and pretentious). The Producers is good enough, but it wouldn't be until Young Frankenstein that Mel Brooks made a masterpiece--unfortunately, his only one. (As an aside, I would like to give this film a 7.5 out of 10.)",7,1,2,9 April 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Steaming...
","The Lord of the Rings Trilogy reminds me of something with which I am quite familiar as a long-time denizen of Central New York: a steaming pile of horse manure. You know, that sickly sweet smell, wafting across hills on a summer breeze. Some people find the scent pleasant. I disagree.Likewise with LOTR. It seems Peter Jackson confused everyone into thinking that this series was something epic, something gargantuan, something important. Really, though, it's not. Yes, it is epic and it's long too, but it's not an important cinematic event. In fifty years, I dare say it'll be forgotten along with Titanic. You remember that plate of tripe, don't you? No, by the time I'm lying prostrate on a hospital bed, these three movies will have long been expunged from my memory and the memories of most others.You see, Mr. Jackson somehow forgot to concoct an interesting story when he drafted his endless (and often excruciatingly dull) battle scenes. There is, really, no character development to speak of. Frodo and Sam remain one-dimensional throughout and what depth Jackson gives them is cursory. And the rest? I have a difficult time keeping them straight.I'm sorry, Ringies, this movie just isn't that good. Maybe it's the glossy coating. See, I love Star Wars and, to be fair, many of the criticisms I've leveled against LOTR could also be leveled against George Lucas' films. Oh, and when I say Star Wars, I speak of the original trilogy. Yet, for all it's craftsmanship, the original Star Wars films were sort of clunky. You could tell that they were models made by hand, sets made by hand, costumes made by hand. It looked like a B-movie and felt like a B-movie and it was a B-movie, albeit one with great set design, costumes, effects, etc. LOTR really is a B-movie as well. Or at least it would have been 50 years ago. Yet, in today's market, it gets gussied up, made into an A-picture and it doesn't deserve it. I'm sorry, I just don't find this movie all that good and you'll never convince me otherwise.5/10 - Three points for tree-beard or whatever his name is and two for the ambition to even film it.",Null,12,24,25 October 2004
Munich," The Best of 2005--#8
","I am not one of those who resides in the camp that condescends to Steven Spielberg for being a successful filmmaker. Because the man makes money (a lot of money) with his films does not make them bad. The man makes original, compelling, and affecting films, regardless of how much money he earns as a result. He's made many stinkers (1941, Empire of the Sun, Amistad, Hook, and Always come to mind), but he is also the captain of Close Encounters, Jaws, ET, Raiders, AI, and Schindler's List. Spielberg may not be an auteur, inasmuch as there has never been what I would call a distinct style to his films, but they are manipulative and masterful in the best way possible. His movies jerk you around, make you cry, make you laugh uncomfortable, and scare you. He's a good filmmaker, and, in many ways, he reminds me of John Huston--another great filmmaker whose movies never had a 'typical' John Huston feeling. In any event, Spielberg's serious films have been pretty hit and miss for me. Schindler's is undeniably excellent, but Private Ryan and the Color Purple seemed simply okay to me. Munich belongs in the same category as Schindler's, as far as Spielberg's serious movies go, and it's also one of the best films he's ever made. It starts off inauspiciously. The scene of the actual kidnapping and the kidnapping/murder's television coverage is phenomenal, but it sinks to mediocrity as the Israelis plan a response. There was something about that meeting sequence that just felt wrong to me. It didn't feel like a good movie but rather felt awkward for no apparent reason. Fortunately, there's nary a bum step from that point forward. For the next two hours you're plunged into the tale of Avner et al as they set out to kill Arabs believed to be responsible for Munich. That Spielberg combines terrific action sequences with thoughtful meditations on terrorism and Israeli-Palestinian relations is incredible. I doubt anyone could have found a better balance. It's also remarkable that Spielberg fails to take sides. I generally despise films that make a point of taking a solid position, so I was pleased to see a film that appears to be neutral on the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. It's a complex situation and, really, both sides are screwed up. That's the way Spielberg presents it. He says look, the situation is totally f****d and both sides murder one another and that's going to keep happening and that's a terrible thing. The film doesn't pretend to have any idea about how to solve this problem, and, though that may upset some, I think that's an honest approach. Who knows how to deal with this problem? I don't know and I doubt Spielberg thinks he has the answers; it would have been false for him to assume the guise of authority. Beyond the film's politics or lack thereof, there is, as I said, a lot to admire. Eric Bana was fantastic (which surprised me greatly), as was the rest of the cast, and the writing is top-notch, thanks, I would imagine, to the wonderful Tony Kushner. There's also a fantastic use of pacing. They edited this film in a way that makes it endurable. This film could drain you had they not decided to include pauses between relatively white-knuckle action sequences. This is a stellar motion picture and one of the year's best.",9,0,1,8 January 2006
Jackie Brown," She wouldn't quit talking...
","Quentin is an infuriating filmmaker inasmuch as, try as I might, I have a hard time finding something wrong with his movies. He's an arrogant, flashy, pompous, occasionally idiotic, and pretentious person; his movies have been, since Pulp Fiction, genius. Granted, that body of work really only comprises three or four films depending on how you count, but it's an incredible, vibrant, and always fun body of work. Pulp Fiction is probably his best film, but Jackie Brown is a close second--a more mature and touching film than anything else in his oeuvre (aside from, of all things, Kill Bill Vol. 2). Jackie Brown is about, well, Jackie Brown, a middle-aged flight attendant busted for helping out a gun-runner. She pals up with Max Cherry, bail-bondman, and double-crosses, nay triple crosses, Ordell, the gun-runner, and leaves Ray Nicolette, ATF agent, flummoxed. It's a convoluted crime film told with precision and an interest in the characters. There's action and incident, but, like the best crime novels, it cares about its people. It makes Jackie and Max and Ordell and Ray and Louis and Melanie real; it makes them fascinating. This is due in part to a wonderful group of actors but also to Quentin's incredible ability to draw pitch-perfect performances from anyone. He even gets De Niro to tone things down, which is something I wish more directors would do, as that's when the man is at his best (look at Goodfellas and tell me that's not his best performance). The story, for those that like the serpentine twists of a crime novel, is delicious, mouthwatering. You sit and watch and find yourself continually amazed and pleased by the developments on screen. It's a great cinematic experience, feeling that inexorable pull as a great filmmaker pulls you around unexpected corners. Jackie Brown lacks some of the 'formal innovations' of Pulp Fiction (sorry, that out-of-step chronology was done before, like, in the 1950s), but it doesn't lack the energy and brilliance that made QT's masterpiece such breath of fresh air. It's simply great and it's simply great to see two fantastic actors (Pam Grier and Robert Forster) in roles they've deserved for years. As I said, Quentin is, as a person, a bit of a, um, ninny (at least as far as his appearances on TV are concerned). He makes great movies. I'd love to rake him over the coals sometimes, but his films shut me up. Now if he could only start demonstrating better taste in the films he champions (Hostel? WTF?).",10,0,2,9 April 2006
Donnie Darko," Far from masterful...
","The first time I saw Donnie Darko, sometime in the beginning of2002, I walked out part way through disgusted with its pretensions.However, to its credit, Darko never left my mind; it was a movie thatI thought about in spare moments, piecing together its fracturednarrative. Because I could not shake the movie from my brain, Iwatched it again, in its entirety this time. Although I still found itpretentious and silly, I also found it entertaining; subsequentviewings have raised it further above my initial assessment.That said, I am not about to proclaim Donnie Darko a masterpiece,nor am I willing to call it a good movie. Ultimately, Donnie Darko isa failure - an attempt at high-minded science fiction that combineselements everyone's already noted, John Hughes and horror. Ofcourse, Hollywood could use a few more failures like this. Itherefore recommend this movie to anyone who likes movies tosee how an interesting idea can turn sour in the hands of anamateur. Philosophical movies rarely work (13 Conversations About OneThing and Waking Life are examples of successful philosophicalfilms). Donnie Darko does not work on the philosophical levelbecause it attempts to infuse philosophy into a story that requiresthe director to spend too much time on narrative. Philosophicalmovies, to be successful, require a lot of talking (and not aboutSmurf's sex lives); a science fiction, horror, teen-comedy plotrequires an emphasis on story. Philosophy therefore takes a backseat to narrative and the whole movie comes off as a cursorysummary of Philosophy 101 (sort of like the Matrix acting as aprimer for Religious Studies). Ultimately, the movie's ideas lackthe depth they deserve; Donnie Darko's philosophical ramblingsare half-baked and appear as such. Ultimately, that's why themovie flounders. As I said, though, it is an entertaining failure. The performances(aside from Jake Gyllenhal who gives easily his worst performance outside of Bubble Boy) are top notch and thecinematography is mostly fantastic (some slow-motion shots wereannoying, but the exteriors of suburbia were perfect).Furthermore, the movie, at times, captures a perfect mood andatmosphere. I am thinking specifically of the scenes toward theend, after Donnie and Gretchen have left the party, and the scenessurrounding their date at the movie theater. The mood created inthose scenes cannot be beat, as they combine perfectly with themusic Kelly chooses for the soundtrack. There's a beautifulelegiac quality to Under the Milkyway, Love Will Tear Us Apart, andKilling Moon that those scenes mirror. If Kelly had maintainedsuch a mood more often, I would be more inclined to give thismovie a positive review. For the most part, people fall into two categories in regard to thismovie - they either love it or hate it. I fall in between. I find there toomany faults in this film to ultimately recommend it, but I also findthat there are enough bright spots for me to abhor it entirely.",Null,0,1,6 November 2004
All the President's Men," Epitome
","All the Presidents Men represents everything that was great about the grand, sweeping, American films of the 1970s. This film is among the reasons people, though I would argue incorrectly, believe the period between Easy Rider and Raging Bull to be the renaissance of American cinema (let's be honest, ladies and gentlemen, any such proclamations are invariably false). Like Chinatown or Apocalypse Now, this is, simply put, unlike any major film released in America today. Something like Good Night and Good Luck comes close, but doesn't quite achieve the audacity of releasing a film representative of the malaise sweeping a nation; Good Night attacks its targets obliquely, while Presidents takes them on head first. That's certainly something to admire. However, if that was all this film is, it wouldn't be as wonderful an achievement as it is. In addition to an overt, yet subdued, political diatribe, you find yourself face to face with, perhaps, the most realistic depiction of journalism committed to celluloid. Sure, the game of cat and mouse that takes place in the film is more akin to a detective story than your typical reporter is used to, but the fact that checking sources takes up so much of this film's running time is amazing. Pakula deserves credit for taking what could have been utterly banal and transforming it into something exciting (all of this, too, in spite of the fact that we know the end before we even start the movie). And then there's the acting... I've never much cared for Robert Redford and have often thought of him as a second-tier actor. Yeah he has starpower and charisma, but he's no Beatty, Nicholson, or Newman; heck, he's even no Reynolds or Bronson or Eastwood. He's a little too pretty and a tad too plastic. When I see him, I think California--bright, sunny, vapid. Anyway, he's excellent here, as is the always reliable Dustin Hoffman. What's great, though, are the supporting actors--Jason Robards and Hal Holbrook in particular. All the President's Men is slick, economical, Hollywood entertainment. It's not necessarily the most intelligent film, but it's definitely smart; it's also not the most aesthetically vibrant, but it has a nice feel to it. This is, simply, the apogee of Hollywood entertainment--a thrilling potboiler in the best sense of the word (I think of it and Shattered Glass in the same terms-- both excellent fun and great ways to spend a few hours).",9,3,3,10 February 2006
The Wizard of Oz," Golden Age
","When people speak of Hollywood's Golden Age, I think they're referring to Casablanca, the Wizard of Oz, and Citizen Kane. These films are timeless, classic, and all-around wonderful. They will never grow old and they will never go away. The Wizard of Oz has been a part of my life for such a long time that, truly, I cannot think of a time in which I was unaware of it. When I was three, I saw my sister become the Wicked Witch of the West in a high school production. I shall never forget her disappearing act. In a puff of smoke, my sister was gone, and I was dismayed. I saw the movie a short time thereafter, in its annual televised appearance on network television, and I've never shaken the feeling of that film. I think, when I see The Wizard of Oz, I see it perennially through the eyes of a four- or five-year old. Any cynicism and experience drops away as soon as I see Dorothy crouch upon the dusty road with Toto. It's transporting. That's to say nothing of the magnificent moment when Dorothy sets foot into Oz. I've watched that moment a thousand times and it still astounds. From sepia to transcendent color--it's such a shock; I cannot imagine what audiences thought in 1939. Apparently, they thought very little of it, as the film did poorly during its initial run. It wasn't, I believe, until the mid-1950s that The Wizard of Oz grabbed hold of the national psyche. Has it ever let go? I can't be sure, but references to it are ineluctable. It has so infiltrated our society that anyone's likely to know the tale whether or not they've seen the movie or read the books. In that regard, it's so unlike almost any other object our culture has produced and certainly any movie. It's in the same pantheon as Huckleberry Finn, Bob Dylan, and baseball. It's, in a manner of speaking, America. That's my take on it, in any event.It's also great spectacle and great entertainment. Not only does it contain memorable performances, it also contains memorable music. The Wizard of Oz represents one of the only films of which I can think that is a musical without quite fitting that category entirely. The songs grow organically out of the picture, unlike, say, another great movie, Singing in the Rain--it's more akin to the early Disney films where music and film were entwined inseparably--or maybe it's like The Red Shoes where music/dance exists symbiotically with narrative. In any event, it's a major achievement and one that I hardly noticed for years. To The Wizard of Oz's credit, I never once thought of it as a musical until I was into my 20s. Moreover, unlike the children's movies of today, there is no fear of inducing fear. The Wicked Witch is frightening, Glinda seemingly impotent, and the flying monkeys crepuscular. Oz is fantastic, but look into the background forests and see some gloom. Look at the plastic flowers in munchkinland, and tell me they're not eerie. The movie is bright and colorful, but with a hint of mischief and melancholy. I would not be surprised to learn that this film stands as a major influence over the work of Tim Burton. His melancholy fairy-tales are far more blatant but nevertheless find source material here. The Wizard of Oz is, quite simply, one of the major works of cinema, American or otherwise. It's great for children and wonderful for adults. I believe, if you do not like this movie you have a heart of stone.",10,3,4,30 December 2005
The Godfather," Re-configured Genre
","During the 1970s, American directors decided, like their French counterparts did in the previous decade, to elevate and transcend the genres that appealed to them as children growing up in the 1940s and50s. Lucas took Buck Rodgers and Science Fiction to new levels, as didSpielberg with the Action/Adventure movie.Some re-made war movies in their own image; others re-configured the Western. Coppola took a stab at elevating the gangster film from B-movie to artistic masterpiece.On some level, he succeeded, transforming the gangster film from movies about crooks to movies about crooks and their families.Though it may not seem like such a difference, adding that familial component made movies about organized crime much more interesting than they had previously been. When critics discuss the great gangster films, few films made before the Godfather are mentioned. The Godfather, in one sense, made gangster movies as we know them. That is no small feat and Coppola ought to be commended for that. He made a solidly acted and directed film in a genre not usually known for those attributes.However, the Godfather is not the greatest movie of all time. It is not even the greatest gangster movie (that would have to go to Goodfellas) or the greatest movie of 1972 (compare it to the dynamic performances of Sleuth, the absolutely absurd and insane Ruling Class, and Bunuel's masterpiece, the Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie and you will find the Godfather lacking).Do not mis-understand: the Godfather is an eminently watchable movie, filled with great performances and guided by the sure hand of a very gifted director. It is simply, though, a very good movie - no more, no less. Perhaps I'm able to take a step back from The Godfather because I wasn't there at the timeI understand its appeal and I understand why people call it one of the greatest motion pictures of all time, but I cannot agree with them. It lacks an intangible quality that all great movies have; it lacks an aura. Movies like Close Encounters and Chinatown have an aura that, though difficult to describe, simply exudes greatness.The Godfather lacks that intangible quality while maintaining all of the tangible qualities of a great film. That one, almost invisible piece, though separates the very good from the great. That intangibleis vital and is something this film simply does not have.",7,4,9,16 November 2004
