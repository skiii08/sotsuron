The Blair Witch Project," If you were really scared by this film, don't read the next word: 'BOO!'
","Ninety minutes of boredom, ending with a dull thud.  If you were really scared by this film, don't read the next word:  'BOO!'  One good thing about it was that I could go to the candy counter at any time and not miss anything.  The only really scary thing about it is how many people think it was good.",Null,1,3,16 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," For episode two, try 100% special effects.
","Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace had the greatest special effects ever put on film.  Unfortunately, it also had the most wooden acting.  The actors were probably afraid of having to satisfy 20 years of pent-up expectations, and showed almost no emotion at all.  Also, we all know that Anakin, Amidalla, and Obi MUST survive to appear in the 'future' movies we've already seen, so there's no suspense when they're in trouble.  Much as he irritated me, Jar Jar showed more emotion than any of the human actors. Oh well, for episode two, try 100% special effects.",Null,0,1,16 August 1999
