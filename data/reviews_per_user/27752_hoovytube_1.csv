Hereditary," We are finally starting to get great horror movies.
","If I've had to compare this to one movie, it would be 'The Shining'. The general audience will most likely find both 'too slow', 'too boring', but if you are tired of obnoxious jumpscare filled movies, this is a really refreshing movie.Pretty much every detail regarding filmmaking: the cinematography, pacing, camera movement, editing and especially acting - is flawless. It's a big rollercoaster of emotions.This movie seems to turn down a lot of people. Many speculate that it is because they are used to the cliched horror flicks that are coming out now, however people noticed a few unintentionally comedic cuts/scenes and in the theater, I heard laughter once - which might be the case. It's quite the shame because I can't remember the last time I was this frightened by a movie.Make sure to see this movie blind. While the plot is quite complicated, I suggest stopping reading about this movie now.",10,2,3,20 June 2018
