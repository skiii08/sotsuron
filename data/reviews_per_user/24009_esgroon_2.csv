The Ring," An excellent movie
",A real movie with the tension that make you shiver for days. In the begin it takes a while but that's standard in all movies. The guy in it is very sexy I must say. It's no problem if you see The ring two first. No you can see why ring 2 is bad and this one is very good to the best. The part with the horse on the boat is stunning and unbelievable done. At the end you think its over. But it goes on. The actors are doing very good acting. The light of the movie is very good. No borrowing moments for me on this movie. I will watch it a second time for sure.I liked the words see spoke at the end. The ring 2 is not very good. Some expensive special effects doesn't make it a good movie. But oke Two is worth seeing also.,10,0,1,5 May 2005
Sin City," Very conservative movie but you feel refreshed
","I didn't know anything about the movie. I just watched it and found it weird, art and excellent. The beginning is really special done. You think this is gone be a borrowing romantic movie; very clich√© but not at all. The movie is beautiful lighted with a lot of dramatic effects. The colouring is art like and well chosen. Bruce Willes puts himself in a daring movie. He gets a big 10 for this. His acting is very good and you can see him as an anti-hero. The movie theme's are very up to date. Cannibalism, child rape and a lot of other very psychopathic people. Its statement is very conservative but it works. And you feel refreshed afterwards. Because deep in ourself we all wish those psychopaths who earn their money on other ones drama should be sent to Sin City.",7,0,1,5 May 2005
