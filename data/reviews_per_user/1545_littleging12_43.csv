Blade Runner 2049," One of the Most Beautiful Looking Films Ever, but it drags
","Blade Runner 2049 successfully captures the essence of the 1982 original classic. Denis Villeneuve was the right man for the job as he brings his maturity, ingenuity and passion, whereas a different director (including Ridley Scott) might have sacrificed quality for nostalgic fan service and superficial storytelling. Villeneuve deepens the world and storyline of Blade Runner in only a way Denis knows how: by being super artistic, visually stunning, mind-bending, and very slow.Blade Runner 2049 attracted some of the most talented and beautiful people in the world to bring this story to life. The film bleeds with mastery, from the directing, to the acting, to the gorgeous production design, to the techno ambient soundtrack, and to the Oscar-worthy cinematography. The lavish and stunning visuals are so incredibly beautiful that if films were graded based on visuals alone this would hands down be the best movie ever. But obviously they're not, so I can't make a statement that bold.Blade Runner 2049 is a little less entertaining and more artful than mainstream audiences were probably hoping for. The storyline builds upon a mystery and slowly unravels throughout the long runtime. It bounces off of one startling revelation to another while subverting viewer expectations in the process. The film picks up on themes from the first and expands upon them in a deep, philosophical, and sometimes confusing manner. Jared Leto's character Niander Wallace talks in such deep metaphors that it's hard to follow everything he is saying. Also since there was no studio interference, the film didn't have a spoon-feeding voice-over narration like the theatrical cut of the original. This allowed for the film to be more artful and less heavy-handed.Clocking in at 2 hrs. and 44 min. makes this nearly an hour longer than the original. The film had many scenes that seemed unnecessary or could have been trimmed down like Ryan Gosling walking around broodingly, weird robot sex scenes, or mundane everyday activity. The pacing was even slower than the original mostly due to the long runtime and the compulsive need for extended shots. The original was quicker, less boring, and had a much stronger conclusion with the most epic monologue in film history.Blade Runner 2049 is a visual masterpiece and a good sequel to an untouchable film. It's so artistic, beautiful and detailed that a single viewing wouldn't do it justice. It's just that siting through certain scenes again will more than test the patience of some. 7.5/10",8,2,6,26 October 2017
First Man," Technically Brilliant with a few genuinely thrilling scenes but mostly a boring film
","Neil Armstrong finally gets a biopic in Damien Chazelle's epic 'First Man.' Chazelle does justice with a practical, honorable, and accurate account of the Apollo 11 space mission to the Moon. However, the movie did not entertain with its thin characterizations, emotional detachment, suspenseless climax, and very boring family narrative.'First Man' features some thrilling space scenes which utilizes film stock and IMAX 70mm. If Chazelle decided to use digital and CGI all the special effects, then he would have been left with a POS movie. The space scenes employ shaky cam, and pitch perfect sound design. During the launches, it sounded like the space craft would break apart, adding to the intensity of the scene.
The score by 'La La Land' composer Justin Hurwitz was jazzy, musical-like and at times searingly epic. I couldn't help but compare the score to another epic space movie 'Interstellar.' Justin Hurwitz's music was good but no where near the level of transcendent epicness of Hans Zimmer's score.'First Man' decided to do something different and focus half the movie on Neil Armstrong's family. The result was a bore-fest. The family drama dragged on and on and really killed the pacing. There was very little characterization for such a stellar cast. Some actors like Corey Stoll, and Kyle Chandler had nothing to do but recite boring exposition. Ryan Gosling's trademark is playing stoic and emotionally reserved men, offering for a perfect casting of a stoic Neil Armstrong. However, Gosling didn't employ that same emotional vulnerability that made him so tantalizing in 'The Place Beyond the Pines.' Everyone knows how the story of Neil Armstrong and the Moon ends. So it really isn't the movie's fault that the ending is predictable and suspenseless. With that said, the ending did not redeem what felt like 3 hours of soap opera family drama on the hallmark channel.Stanley Kubrick did a better job directing the moon landing than Damien Chazelle. #MoonLandingFaked.

It," It Sequel in Trouble!
","Stephen King's It is regarded by some to be one of the most terrifying books to date. The 2017 remake of the 1990 miniseries doesn't come remotely close to that level. It delivered mainstream goods with disturbing mutilations, solid performances, a plethora of jump scares, and plenty of comedic lines delivered gleefully by profane-centric kids. Once you look past the surface of It you realize it's not scary, it's got no tension, and is really nothing but a clown trying to jump scare you to death!The 1990 miniseries worked better due to its appropriate handling of transitioning between the characters' adolescence into their adulthood. As kids, they won a crucial battle against It, yet they were still deeply scarred by the terror of It. In this movie, they defeat It by overcoming their fear which is how It kills you, through fear. So how the hell is the sequel supposed to be worth anything if Pennywise comes back and the adult versions of the kids aren't afraid of him. He is no threat and It 2 won't do anything new but try and jump scare the audience every five seconds. The filmmakers don't seem to get that good horror is not all about jump scare after jump scare. You don't build tension with jump scares, you release tension with a jump scare. The horror of It proved to be utterly ineffective and too try-hard. The lack of character depth left the film feeling soulless and empty. The humor was more shocking then refreshing. The sequel is in serious trouble and is almost a mission impossible to make it good if the filmmakers are just going to do the same thing. In the filmmakers eyes, the financial success of this film justifies every decision they made and why not imitate themselves for Part 2. Their funeral.",5,2,6,21 September 2017
Detroit," American Horror Story: Detroit
","Kathryn Bigelow's latest film, Detroit, recounts the chaotic 1967 Detroit Riots as well as the following incidents at the Algiers Motel. To say the film is not for the faint of heart is a massive understatement. Detroit unapologetically personifies the horrors of racism, bigotry, and cruelty. From the opening frame to the last, Detroit is a masterclass of unnerving, riveting and downright horrifying cruelty. It's as important of a film as its cry out for change.Kathryn Bigelow seems to have found her niche with real life dramatizations of American history. With this film, she reaches the heights of Paul Greengrass (Captain Phillips, United 93) in the art of creating tension and sustaining it. She masterfully captures the intensity, frustration, and chaos of the riots. The riots feel so tangible it's as if Kathryn Bigelow walked in on a riot and started filming. She displays the same skill with the Algiers scenes except with much more precision. The whole second act of the film is more terrifying, intense and horrific than most horror movies. It's so well done you don't even notice that it takes up the majority of the film's long runtime. Bigelow even keeps the film rolling through scenes (particularly at the end) where other directors may have stumbled. Bigelow, with Detroit, succeeds whereas Christopher Nolan, with Dunkirk, did not. Bigelow captures the tension early on and doesn't let it leave her grasp while Nolan undercut the tension and didn't get it back again due to his compulsive need for complexity, and incoherence.Detroit may be a masterclass of tension but it also features an exceptional performance from Will Poulter. Will Poulter shines as the racist cop Krauss, and completely shatters his image of creepy virgin eyebrows kid from We're the Millers. From the get-go you just couldn't take your eyes off this monster. His unrelenting ferocity and devilish hatred towards his victims makes your skin crawl in fear. This is an excellent performance that deserves Oscar attention (though may not get it due to how controversial his character is). Another standout was Algee Smith who may make a name for himself, maybe even as a singer. John Boyega (Melvin Dismukes in the film) was good even though Mark Boal (the screenwriter) may have forgotten about him as Boyega just stood by as if he was a ghost. Another hiccup that the screenwriter never addressed was why didn't the civilians at the Algiers just blame the dead black guy (played by Jason Mitchell) for shooting at the police and hiding the gun, especially since he was the shooter. Maybe a case of don't talk to the police or they're honoring their dead friend, but some clarity to this would have been more appropriate. Some of the biggest complaints about this film is that like The Passion of the Christ it focuses on the violence in favor of a deeper meaning. But the violence in Detroit and in The Passion both serve a purpose. They do not glorify their brutality but they show the audience the true horror of that brutality, and what had to be sacrificed for a greater change. Another popular gripe is that the film is historically inaccurate. The filmmakers even displayed a subtitle stating that they had to dramatize certain events and fill in the blanks since some things are still clouded in mystery. Even the real life Dismukes said in an interview that the film is 99.50% accurate. That statistic should also silence any haters calling this film SJW propaganda.Detroit is an absolute must watch. It's THE best film of the year, thus far, and due to its relevance should be a definite Oscar contender. Kathryn Bigelow has made her best movie here and has established herself as one of Hollywood's most prized directors.",9,4,12,11 October 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Battlefront: A Star Wars Story
","Disney looks to further cash in on its four billion dollar investment by making a prequel that precedes the events of 'Star Wars: A New Hope.' 'Rogue One: A Star Wars Story' chronicles the daring mission the rebel spies undertook to steal the Death Star plans. Rogue One has what you would expect: amazing special effects, exhilarating action, engaging story, and fine performances, but also adds rare complexity, grittiness, and easter eggs that does the old films justice. Yet what holds it back from topping last year's 'The Force Awakens' is its erroneous mindset that bigger is better, its narrative flaws, and its awkward flow the ending leaves for 'A New Hope.''Rogue One' delivers on what fans wanted. The action scenes are gripping and capture the same intensity as a war movie. The special effects are state of the art, as usual. The story is exciting and patches up the plot hole from the first film of an all-powerful Death Star having such an exploitable weakness. The acting and writing are also perfectly fine. Director Gareth Edwards displays a meticulous attention to detail (like making sure the costumes and technologies fit well with the original films). He also never misses a moment for easter eggs and Star Wars nerdom (Red Five, old X-wing pilots to name a few). 'Rogue One' takes the next step in its franchise's filmography with its darker tone, war movie-like battles, and deeper thought-provoking themes. Having the rebellion vs Empire feud not seem so black and white was another great aspect because it offered for some rare complexity we normally don't see in a Star Wars movie.'Rogue One' features a whole new entourage of characters with a few familiar cameos. Some of the most memorable are Donnie Yen's blind yet still lethal 'Force' enthusiast Chirrut ÃŽmwe (who supplies the funniest line in the movie). Also there is the ambitious and cunning Orson Krennic played brilliantly by Ben Mendelsohn. There are plenty of others but those two are my personal favorite. The only problem with these characters is that you don't feel as emotionally attached to them as you did with the characters in the original trilogy, and even 'The Force Awakens,' making for a less effective conclusion.Though just like 'The Force Awakens,' the film was never going to be perfect because Edwards (maybe the studio) chose to deliver the fans what they wanted instead of what they needed. The biggest gripe with this film is the obligatory final act. The final act doesn't flow well with the timeline of 'A New Hope.' The battle is so grandiose in its ambitions that it fails to logically set up 'A New Hope.' So then 'A New Hope' would start out where Princess Leia is like 'we are on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan,' and Darth Vader be like 'b@!$h you just blew up half our fleet!' The scene that perfectly epitomizes the unnecessary overkill and pompousness of the third act was when Darth Vader wrecks twenty rebel soldiers who were trying to safely deliver the Death Star plans. The scene was completely unnecessary, and total overkill. It had potential to be the best scene in the movie but just fell flat and arguably was the worst scene in the movie. Also, the whole thing with the majority of the Rebel council declining the decision to attack Scariff was a bit ridiculous because they decided not to attack, then all of a sudden they send in a huge fleet to get the plans based off some sketchy criminal's claims (Jyn in this case). Like really, they risk all of that without any proof that Jyn is telling the truth.'Rogue One: A Star Wars Story' was like the video game Star Wars Battlefront. It was all-out war between pawns. It focused completely on the Rebel Alliance's struggle against the Empire. It had no Jedi story lines, lightsaber duels or any sign of the Force. It was all about the grunts fighting in this war, and really excelled with its depiction of warfare and how the rebellion affected these characters. Exploring new themes and bringing a war movie-feel really helped this film feel refreshingly new. Yet it suffered from its lofty ambitions to wow its audience with huge space battles that maimed the continuity it had with 'A New Hope.' Overall 'Rogue One' is another success and satisfied its audience with enough Star Wars magic to overcome its flaws. This was a good appetizer until we get the full meal in 'Star Wars: Episode VIII.'",8,1,6,3 January 2017
Troy," Spectacular Entertainment
","Following the breakout success of Braveheart and Gladiator, comes the larger-than-life blockbuster about the legendary Trojan War. Troy, loosely based on Homer's The Iliad, is a slam-bang blockbuster action flick. Aside from the commercial appeal, Troy is also an epic, philosophical, and realistic retelling of one of the greatest stories of all time.Troy has everything a traditional movie-goer could want: thrilling action, sprawling scale, state-of-the-art special effects, A-list actors, exciting soundtrack, endearing heroes, quotable lines, romance, drama, and political intrigue. Troy fulfills enough surface level needs to sustain an action junkie for years on end. It is so entertaining that you could rewatch it again and again and not get bored. But, it is also a film with copious amounts of depth and character development.Critics were quick to label Troy shallow. However, Troy digs deep into themes such as belief in the gods, passion, and duties to one's country. The director's cut goes deeper into the characters and their motivations, as well as amping up the violence. Even in the theatrical cut, a major theme is how downplayed the roles of the gods are. Troy deviates from its source material as it takes a more realistic approach. So there are no fantasy elements like Apollo shooting fireballs out of his arse. This was a very wise decision because it made Troy more realistic, gritty, and all the more entertaining. Troy looks real aesthetically, and feels real emotionally, unlike the CGI mess that was 300.Some of the most underrated scenes in the film are counsel debates circulating around the gods and the Greeks, Achilles' monologue on his take on the gods, and Peter O'Toole's heartbreaking plea to Achilles for his son's body. It's smaller moments like these that give Troy the depth needed to feel the inevitable emotional gut-punch delivered by the end. For example, take the counsel debate scene. It's very interesting hearing how religious 'servants of Apollo' and someone like Hector, likely an agnostic, rationalize their thinking. Hector is portrayed as being very logical and practical, as opposed to the priests who try to plan strategies based on religious symbolism (like bird signals). It's all the more saddening when Hector dies as the city becomes doomed by illogical rationale. This all adds another layer of depth to Troy; it's philosophical, and emotional. It takes into account the role of religion and how that affects the characters. The viewer is brought into the characters' world and empathize with the actors' sympathetic portrayals.If there are any flaws to pick out in Troy, they're nitpicks. In the director's cut, there are needless long takes of dogs, cheesy lines, and inappropriate music played during emotional scenes. But these are minor and forgivable, especially since the director's cut adds more character depth and violence. The acting and dialogue is not Oscar-worthy, but they are good enough. Just like in The Lord of the Rings films, there are minor cheesy or dumb things, but they are easily overlooked because everything around those small moments is awesome!Troy is just as entertaining, epic, star-studded, bloody, and philosophical as Game of Thrones. Both have the same writer, and you really can't love one without loving the other. Troy hits the mark with spectacular entertainment value while also speaking to the heart and soul.",10,2,5,2 February 2019
Deadpool 2," 'The Greatest Sequel since Human Centipede II' -- Deadpool
","'Deadpool 2' is the greatest superhero sequel since 'The Dark Knight.' Its rapid-fire meta humor, immense hilarity, and non-stop entertainment marks the second coming of Jesus. Ha just kidding. Let's be real, littleging12 is writing another wordy and pretentious review so he can pretend that he has a big penis, when in reality he has a chode. With these reviews, littlejizz hopes to deceive uneducated Mexican immigrants into thinking he is Conan O'Brien.In his review of 'Deadpool,' littleging12 stated that 'what holds it back from greatness is its superficially structured story, unimpressive CGI action, ineffective resonance and bland one-dimensional characters excluding the titular character.' If he was anymore pretentious, he'd get nominated for an Oscar. 'Deadpool 2' improves over the original with a better story, better side characters, better CGI action, bigger heart, and smaller penis. What holds it back from getting a 10/10 is littleging12's bull sh$!$y rating system. In all seriousness, 'Deadpool 2' is very entertaining, hilarious, and one of the better sequels in recent memory. It may not be the most sophisticated or artistic movie, but it delivers everything you could want out of an irreverent superhero comedy. Deadpool is the character Ryan Reynolds was born to play and he will hang up his suit (and his dildo) as a pop culture icon. 8.5/10",9,1,2,14 August 2018
The Hateful Eight," 'The Thing' + 'Reservoir Dogs' + 'Clue' + 'Django Unchained' = 'The Hateful Eight'
","Quentin Tarantino's highly anticipated 'The Hateful Eight' further augments the director's portfolio of transgressive, innovative, and influential filmmaking. He successfully enhances the quality of his film with the use of the 70mm extended edition featuring an overture and intermission. Tarantino pays homage to the epics of the 50's and 60's with this long forgotten film technique. It pays off very well because it provides the viewer with more of an experience rather than just an ordinary watch.'The Hateful Eight' is a film that is highly influenced by other films. It features the same atmosphere and tension of 'The Thing', the talky ultraviolent stage play of 'Reservoir Dogs,' the whodunit mystery of 'Clue,' and finally the setting, genre, and vengeful mood of 'Django Unchained.' QT masterfully creates well rounded nefarious characters in an enclosed environment. The characters are brought to life by phenomenal performances from Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell, Walton Goggins, and Jennifer Jason Leigh -- who was the only person to get an Oscar nod. These performances were guided by QT's extraordinary writing. Also the score was excellent from legendary composer Ennio Morricone, and really made rather slow moments more suspenseful. Finally the cinematography was great and almost matched 'The Revenant' in artistic beauty. The main complaints about the film from critics are that the film is overlong with excessive dialogue, excessive violence, and finally an absence of character morals. The dialogue did drag on especially in the first half but it was all made worth while in the second half with the violent interplay between characters, the gut twisting climax, and finally the jaw dropping monologues QT is known for. The film is incredibly violent but it helps set the hateful and brutal tone of the film. Finally the characters are mostly despicable, and lack morals. But how many movies actually have a 'bad guys vs. less bad guys' storyline? Like seriously this is the core of the movie -- the characters are hateful! It's called 'The Hateful Eight' for a reason and the characters certainly are not sugarcoated or lionized in any way. Overall this film is another brutal and highly entertaining masterpiece from Quentin Tarantino.",9,5,13,5 April 2016
"I, Tonya"," Redneck Goodfellas on Ice
","I, Tonya boasts two first rate performances from Margot Robbie and Allison Janney in this honestly-told and hard-nosed based on a true story adaptation. The film transcends many based on a true story adaptations by not completely coasting off the source material. It adds unexpected depth by delving into what it takes to make a champion and how far parents are willing to go to push their kids to the maximum.I, Tonya is clearly inspired by the hard hitting cruelty, black humor and self-awareness of Goodfellas. With the source material, this approach proved to be more effective than derivative. The character interviews explaining why things happened allowed the film to be more funny, honest, and meta. You see these peoples' side and understand why they acted the way they did, even if sometimes their decisions were completely idiotic and downright amoral. The only person you feel for is Tonya Harding due to her abusive relationships with her mother and boyfriend, and the fact that her skating career was ruined thanks to a couple of bumbling idiots. Every other character is entertaining but is either ugly, abusive, or downright trashy. Give the movie props for not trying to lionize them and depicting them for how they really are.Something thought-provoking the film brought up had to do with the complex relationship between Tonya and her overbearing mother. When Tonya becomes an Olympian, her mother tries to take credit for it saying that she made Tonya a champion, through all the cruelty and abuse. Does beating and making high demands of your children really make them champions, driven to overcome any obstacle or opponent? Hmm maybe my parents should've beaten my ass so I'd learn to write better reviews and become the new Ebert. Damnit mom and dad! Haha just kidding.I, Tonya scores with its funny, well acted, and unbelievable true story that doesn't quite stick the landing discourtesy of its awful CGI skating scenes and unsympathetic, albeit entertaining, characters.",8,1,1,14 February 2018
Molly's Game," She Got Game
","Aaron Sorkin (aka The Godfather of dialogue) teams up with the ravishing Jessica Chastain and Idris Elba to bring the crazy true story of Molly Bloom to the big screen. 'Molly's Game,' based on the book of the same name, chronicles the underbelly of the most exclusive, illegal high-stakes poker game in LA. Sorkin, in his directorial debut, brings his signature fluid dialogue and exceptional writing. Jessica Chastain brings her signature acting chops and amps up the eye candy to glorious effect. Together, they produce one of the best written and most consistently engaging movies of the year.'Molly's Game' follows the trope of an ambitious and morally questionable person who gambles everything, builds an empire only to have it come crashing down upon them, writes a successful book about it, and even gets a movie adaptation. This has been done many times before, but what helps 'Molly's Game' stand out is not only Sorkin's dialogue and Chastain's charisma, but the depth explored between Molly and her complicated father (played magnetically by Kevin Costner). One of the best scenes in the film is towards the end when Molly and her father have an intervention of emotional awakening. It may seem shoehorned in for some old-fashioned father daughter catharsis, but the intelligence and power of the scene are enough to overcome this. Molly's father confronts her on why she chose her path of running an illegal business and calls her out for wanting to control powerful men as a way to get back at him. This scene beautifully breaks down the enigma that is Molly Bloom and is like an orgasm of self-actualization.The only real flaws of 'Molly's Game' are the repetitiveness in the story - could've trimmed the runtime - and the dialogue is so fast it's as if it's sped up. Otherwise, Sorkin and company make what could have been another average based on a true story crime drama, into a marvelously written and acted, fast paced entertainment.",8,3,5,14 March 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Just Another Marvel Movie. Nothing New Here.
","The MCU tried to aggrandize its cast of superheroes by integrating Spider-Man into the mix in Captain America: Civil War. After an already attempted reboot, the odds were against this pseudo-origin story from being a success although the lovable childish charms of Tom Holland's take on the character was its one silver lining. The end result is a sporadically entertaining special effects driven comedy-drama that lacks in consistent humor, engaging action and serious drama.Spider-Man: Homecoming diverted away from the other Spidey entries by focusing more time on Peter Parker rather than Spider-man. The film is heavily inspired by 80's high school comedy-dramas. It's more lighthearted and comical, which ultimately works against the movie because it's hard taking any of the perilous situations seriously. The action scenes are unimpressive and more been-there-done-that. Some of the jokes land while others are just lame, annoying, and/or repetitive (i.e. Penis Parker, ice cream in the car). There were some good performances (Michael Keaton as Vulture) and an interesting little twist, yet they didn't pack the punch needed to redeem the film.Spider-Man: Homecoming is just another byproduct of an already successful formula. No risks were taken, no characters died, and no lasting impression was left. The MCU continues to play it safe and only when they decide to break from their puss-cocoon will they finally produce something truly great. 5.5/10",4,11,17,21 August 2017
Interstellar," 'That's what I love about relativity man, other people get older, I stay the same age.' Is what stoned Cooper would say.
","While I was watching 'Interstellar' I kept thinking about Matthew McConaughey's character of Wooderson from 'Dazed and Confused' mainly because I watched it right before I saw 'Interstellar.' I could not take his character Cooper seriously at first because I could not stop thinking about his stoner counterpart. This was before I saw any of McConaughey's previous triumphs so I was not fully engaged in the McConaissance. McConaughey has proved his acting skills and has really developed into a serious and respectable actor. His performance in 'Interstellar' was stellar after of course I got over his whole Wooderson thing.Now let me actually start talking about the movie. I thought it was great. I was never bored with it and I was very intrigued to find out where this adventure was going. Though I admit some of the story was overcomplicated especially the science behind it all but after multiple viewings you start to understand it better just like Nolan's previous films like 'The Prestige' and 'Inception.' This movie did not disappoint and after watching it the film stuck with me and I found myself thinking about it a lot. Overall, this film is a sci-fi masterpiece.I love Christopher Nolan films and he is one of the few directors out there that has consistently made good movies and he is a director that you can rely on. I think the man is a genius. He has the ability to produce pictures that will immerse the audience from start to finish in the worlds that he creates. Also to mention that his films make bank. I am a huge fan of his practical effects as well, which look great in all his movies.'Interstellar' is another great film from Chirstopher Nolan. He really knows how to bring the best out of his actors. The performances in 'Interstellar' were really good. The score from frequent collaborator Hans Zimmer was fantastic and really made the movie more impactful. The visual effects I thought were amazing and were well deserving of the Oscar. I was very intrigued by all of the scientific anomalies present in the film and really sparked an interest in space which I have never been big on. In closing, 'Interstellar' is a classic sci-fi masterpiece that I think most will like and respect for its one of a kind type of movie. The originality of this movie is insane. (In a good way of course)",10,2,5,8 July 2015
Baby Driver," Shows Fast and Furious how it's done
","Edgar Wright's super stylistic pseudo-musical, Baby Driver, puts the Fast and Furious franchise to shame, proving that action-fueled car chasing movies can still be smart, practical, and ball-tinglingly thrilling. Not to say that the Fast and Furious movies don't have their moments, it's just they deter future filmmakers from creating smartly written, practical action films that don't overlie on CGI and over-the-top shenanigans. Baby Driver isn't without its over-the-top shenanigans but its sharp writing, crisp editing and direction, thrilling car chases, delightful humor, and soundtrack help it rise above its over-the-top moments and disengaging romance. Baby Driver (mostly) hits the mark. The action scenes are directed with so much flair and swift camera movements it's like directors' heaven. Everything in the film is choreographed to the beat of the songs like a carefully rehearsed dance routine. The soundtrack scores and really helps capture the emotion, however, I just wish they could have had one or two songs devoted to classical music (given Kevin Spacey's trailer line 'young Mozart in a go kart'). The cast flourishes and really delivers what they are known for: Kevin Spacey's no-nonsense badassery, Jamie Foxx's bad guy antics, Jon Hamm's suave demeanor (for the first two acts at least), and Ansel Elgort's, well he was quite an unknown heading into this but now has surely made a name for himself. And of course the cast was able to flourish with Edgar Wright's cheeky clever dialogue. With all these qualities it seems as if Baby Driver should be a near masterpiece and one of the better action films in years, yet, somethings took me out of it. For instance, I felt as if the romance happened rather quickly and didn't leave a whole lot of room for any real depth. Debora (Lily James) impulsively jumps into this dangerous relationship with Baby and the whole thing just seemed like an only-in-the-movies romance. Also Jon Hamm might have been playing the Terminator. He survives a gun shot wound to the chest while evading cops TWICE, then he is somehow able to jump out of a falling car before impact, and comes out unscathed from the jump. Don't be going Fast and Furious on us Edgar Wright! Baby Driver has enough pros to overcome a few distracting cons. It's definitely one of the best films of the year so far and adds another benchmark to Edgar Wright's portfolio of quirky entertaining action comedies. 7.5/10",8,10,18,9 July 2017
The Revenant," A Beautifully Striking Art House Film
","'The Revenant' features the same successful formula of Alejandro González Iñárritu's previous Oscar winning film 'Birdman:' excellent filmmaking from a very talented cast and crew. It heavily relies on its visceral power, filmmaking technique, committed performances from its actors, and the majestic beauty of its setting to overcome its simplistic story.'The Revenant' starts out strong with one of the most well shot and immensely gripping scenes of the year in which Indians attack the fur trappers. The scene was executed to perfection with stunning visuals, gut wrenching intensity, graphic violence, and a realistic perspective the audience experiences first hand through the use of a meticulously engineered tracking shot. Then there was the intense bear mauling scene which was also masterfully shot, though not as ambitious in scope as the opening scene. Unfortunately for 'The Revenant' its best scenes were in the beginning of the film.As 'The Revenant' dragged on it became sluggish, unfocused, and almost inaudible. Although throughout the film it showed signs of life by expertly depicting intense confrontations and beautiful scenery. But at the same time, between the gripping and exciting moments, there were many dull dream-like sequences that failed to give a clear understanding of DiCaprio's Hugh Glass. For the long runtime, Hugh Glass was not properly developed to feel the sufficient magnitude of his suffering. Leonardo DiCaprio's engaging, and somatic performance was enough to overshadow this flaw, and it may even land him his first Oscar.Then there was Tom Hardy's menacing John Fitzgerald. Tom Hardy's portrayal was good yet underwhelming for Oscar standards because it was difficult to understand what exactly he was saying. Yet maybe this was done on purpose for authenticity but it still made it hard to understand his character and some vital plot explanations. Finally the film felt so self-indulgent in its own style of natural light filmmaking that it seemed like the filmmakers stretched shots and sequences for too long just to show off their prowess.In conclusion, 'The Revenant' is a well-acted, masterfully shot, slow moving revenge/survival art house film with amazing scenery. The film will definitely win Oscars for its filmmaking craft but falls short of greatness because of its flaws. It may win best picture, but it is not the best movie of the year. 'The Revenant' did not fulfill its duties as effectively and successfully as 'Mad Max: Fury Road,' 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens,' or 'The Hateful Eight' to reach 'best movie of the year' status.",8,5,7,28 January 2016
Dunkirk," A Masterful Technical Achievement. Can't say the same Storytelling-wise.
","Christopher Nolan's newest film 'Dunkirk' tells the true story of the evacuation at the titular location where allied forces were miraculously shipped across the British channel by civilian boats. Christopher Nolan does what he does best and puts the viewer right in the dead center of this significant battle of WWII. The result is an immersive, realistic, and intense experience that better give Christopher Nolan his first Oscar nomination for Best Director. However, the film did not meet the hype (at least my own personal hype being my most anticipated film of the year) with its unnecessary non-linear storytelling, emotional detachment, and pretentious cumpulsion for uniqueness. 'Dunkirk' started out with a very jumpy bang. Christopher Nolan throws the audience right into the action and never lets up with the thought of an imminent attack lurking at any moment. The opening scenes are cinema at its most grandeur. The usage of practical effects for the ships, planes, buildings, soldiers, and locations are outstanding and say a lot about Christopher Nolan's dedication for telling realistic stories. The strafing runs and dog fighting scenes are directed to perfection and for a split second make you forget you are watching a movie. 'Dunkirk' is undeniably gorgeous that'll definitively win Oscars for its craft.'Dunkirk' may be a winner on a technical scale but a movie needs a little more to be a truly remarkable film. A common complaint about the film is a lack of character development. Going in, I knew this would be a more visceral film with little dialogue where the emotional core banks on common human empathy. Christopher Nolan wanted to focus on the event of Dunkirk, not the characters, but it is hard to feel for these people especially when you don't even know their names. Frequent Nolan collaborator, Hans Zimmer, provided the score, and he delivers with pieces ranging from gut-wrenchingly intense (Supermarine) to searingly hopeful (Variation 15). A misstep the film took was overplaying Zimmer's score which ended up toning down the actual sounds of bombardment. I even had trouble hearing some of the dialogue (upon first viewing) resulting in a lot of confusion on what was happening when there were dialogue driven scenes. I couldn't even judge the acting because half the things people said didn't register, but at least everyone looked the part.Christopher Nolan structured the film with three different perspectives -- land, air, and sea -- all interweaving at a critical point. Some perspectives last longer than others (an hour, a day, a week) and Nolan jumps around between perspectives without any indication where the viewer is at in time. Some may think this is a clever and unique way to tell the story but it just killed some of the tension when you see the same scene for a third time, or when something is about to climax and it just cuts away. Nolan overcomplicates a quite simple story. He tries too hard to be unique when certain conventionalities would have been more effective like making his film R-rated for maximum realism and intensity.Given the potential, mastery, and high expectations, 'Dunkirk' is a bit disappointing. It's a sensation for the eyes and ears but it leaves your brain in a knot further causing a blockade to the heart. It's a film that in order to fully appreciate, must be viewed on the big screen. For all of 'Dunkirk's' flaws, it's still one of the best theatrical movies ever made, and can't be missed in theaters. 7.5/10",8,4,8,24 July 2017
Avengers: Infinity War," Avengers: Vanishers
","'Avengers: Infinity War' does what no movie has done before: incorporate 40+ superhero characters into one epic showdown against a god-like villain. This idea may have seemed too daunting 10 years ago, but with the talent present and the previous success of the MCU to at least make a decent movie, 'Avengers: Infinity War' delivers, and stands as one of the best MCU movies to date.The Russo Brothers prove to be the best directing force the MCU has to offer. They made Captain America good with 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' and brought the franchise to its high point with 'Captain America: Civil War.' They don't disappoint here and do a great job of integrating all three phases of the MCU. They deftly balance screen time allowing a lot of the characters time to shine. Though they definitely could've trimmed time with the more boring characters like Vision, Scarlett Witch, Gamora and Nebula. The Russo Brothers forte is with the character interplay. The superhero interactions are the highlight of the movie as their banter is very comical, eliciting nerdgasms galore. The Guardians are the funniest and arguable the best characters in the MCU. The cartoonish action takes a back seat to the abundant humor and witty interplay. The action scenes are mostly enjoyable and inventive especially with Doctor Strange's wizard portals. It's very exciting to see the Avengers use pop-culture references to solve their problems (i.e. Aliens). The problem is that there is still some cheesiness with the action (characters having small talk during huge fights, characters smashing into each other mindlessly). The aesthetic of the characters' costumes and the CGI battle scenes give off a cartoonish vibe. One would have to let their inner nerd carry them away for maximum enjoyment of the action.*Spoilers*
'Avengers: Infinity War' finally introduces the storyline of Thanos as a power player. Thanos isn't your typical I-want-to-rule-the-world bad guy. He presents himself as a reluctant father-figure willing to make the tough choice: to kill half of existence so the other half can live with their dwindling resources. Thanos does not see himself as a bad guy but as a liberator willing to make sacrifices for the greater good. Of course the Avengers don't see it that way. What results from the Avengers' and Thanos' showdown is something Marvel has not done before, nor anyone would think they had the balls to do. Many of the common complaints regarding MCU is that the heroes are impenetrable and no matter how cool they make the action sequences look, there is still that lingering stigma that no one will die. This leaves the action to be without real stakes or compelling drama. But 'Infinity War' changes it up here and has Thanos succeed in killing half the Avengers team off (a microcosm for humanity). This resulted in a shocking and totally unexpected move. But.... one problem. Some of the character deaths are probably gonna be permanent like Loki and Vision but people who died from vanishing are likely to come back in the next film after the Avengers figure out how to undo everything Thanos did. Even if certain characters stay dead, it's not like a whole lot of them will be missed (only Drax and the Guardians would be missed if they died). MCU has more films planned like another Spider-Man, Guardians of the Galaxy, and Doctor Strange sequels (all of said characters died in 'Infinity War'). This all means MCU doesn't have the balls to kill off characters that will churn out more money. They may have fooled us for a little while but we know their tricks. Hopefully they prove me wrong in Part II.'Avengers: Infinity War' is the best Avengers movie and one of the best MCU movies to date. It's thoroughly watchable, funny, entertaining, and even has a few tricks up its sleeve. It's a movie too big to miss. To have this many iconic superheroes, big time stars, and outlandish cast of characters in one movie is a cinematic experience you cannot miss. Be sure to keep your expectations in check because this movie is still a Marvel movie at the end of the day. It is not as good as the IMDb rating of 8.7, which makes it a top 20 movie of all time. No way!",8,1,4,9 June 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Not what I was Expecting
","Quentin Tarantino's 9th film features some of the biggest superstars in the business. Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt really are the best duo since Paul Newman and Robert Redford. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is worth watching just for the epic star power alone along with Tarantino's signature killer soundtrack. Tarantino is known to subvert norms and create controversy. He does so here, but to a lesser satisfying degree.When news first hit about Tarantino doing an old Hollywood piece centering around the Manson murders of 1969, one could assume he'd be doing another wild over-the-top bloodbath with snappy dialogue, entertaining storytelling and iconic characters. While the Mansons and Sharon Tate are present in the film, their roles are disappointingly underrepresented. Sharon Tate (played gleefully by Margot Robbie) does not do much throughout the movie but watch her own films. The Manson ranch is shown but Charlie Manson is only present for five seconds. These people vital to the real life story don't really have much purpose here. The story focuses more on Leonardo DiCaprio's character Rick Dalton, a former TV star trying to stay relevant in the Hollywood spotlight.While the story at hand with Rick Dalton has its moments (Bruce Lee scene and forgetting lines), it's too long and too dragged out. Tarantino goes for setting an authentic feel, and establishing character development over plot. Much of the film feels like it's going nowhere, so it's boring sometimes. The film is more of a love letter to old Hollywood. A lot of work was put into taking us back in time to 1969, impressively done without CGI. It's impressive technically but it lacks an exciting narrative - something Tarantino normally delivers on. The first two hours or so shows everyday life for these characters, but doesn't become a 'movie' until the end. The last 15 minutes is classic Tarantino. Without spoiling it, it utilizes everything we have come to know and love about Tarantino. He subverts your expectations, but to a lesser satisfying degree.A film where Tarantino brought every act of his storytelling prowess together was The Hateful Eight. The Hateful Eight set up a mystery while making the audience guess what was going to happen next. Then it climaxed into a violent, hysterical, quotable, and utterly badass bloodbath. But what Once Upon a Time in Hollywood was lacking was the build-up to the climax. The ending was just slapped on so you know you're watching Tarantino. The Hateful Eight worked better as a story which is why the ending was much more satisfying than this film.Once Upon a Time in Hollywood delivers some rare cinematic treats, courtesy of Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt. However, one can't help but feel a little disappointed with Tarantino given the stellar cast and the legendary Manson backstory he had to work with.",6,4,5,3 October 2019
Beasts of No Nation," This is what you call a Vegetable Movie
","Netflix's first original film 'Beasts of No Nation' explores the horrors of child soldiers in an unnamed African country. The film is akin to disturbing historical dramas like 'Schindler's List' and '12 Years a Slave' by its bleak mood, horrific realism, and its matured, well handled filmmaking. Given the film's somber and depressing tone, you could expect this film to thoroughly intrigue yet mildly entertain. However, the film is well made but mostly feels repetitive, boring, and hollow with little payoff making it a vegetable movie.The film featured some impressive filmmaking but lacked some kind of spark in the story. The story felt so gloomy that it seemed near impossible to actually get enjoyment out of it unless you are some kind of sociopath. The action sequences were shot strangely so you could not really tell who was who or even what was going on. Many moments and scenes seemed redundant and directionless. For example the child soldiers lead by Idris Elba's Commandant would attack villages and kill those who they saw as enemies. This is basically all that happened throughout the entire movie! It is all the same thing without proper pacing in the story, substance in the supporting characters, and maybe most importantly nothing innovative and thought provoking to say about the current situation of child soldiers. All these flaws are noticeable at the even more frustrating ending that mounted to nothing! So basically this movie is mostly dull with little to no entertaining moments.However there were some silver linings to this movie. The acting was great with some very believable characters particularly Idris Elba's Commandant. Also to mention Abraham Attah, who played Agu, did a fine job portraying Agu though Idris Elba did steal the show from him. The sets and special effects were superb given the lower budget of the film. The sets seemed extremely accurate to African terrain. The writer/director Cary Joji Fukunaga, who directed season one of 'True Detective,' did a solid job of writing and directing; although it did not reach the same heights as 'True Detective.' Basically, this movie was well made and did not have any dumb generic clichés most Hollywood movies suffer from. In a nutshell, the film is intelligent and Fukunaga handled the material respectfully.So how exactly did the term vegetable movie come about? Well what it basically means is that the movie was good but not entertaining. It was an important informative movie that recycled a disturbing message on child soldiers by showing people the horrors that occur today. Yet at the same time the movie failed to entertain, which you could make an argument for that the number one job of a movie is to entertain. So just like vegetables, which are good for you but not well liked amongst teenagers, 'Beasts of No Nation' is a good movie for someone to watch to learn from. Yet at the same time it will not entertain. If you want to be informed and entertained, some movies similar to this one that are more compelling are 'Blood Diamond,' 'Black Hawk Down,' and even 'Captain Phillips.'",6,4,11,17 December 2015
Get Out," Don't be so Quick to get in on 'Get Out'
","Jordan Peele's directorial debut 'Get Out' is a comedy-horror about race with a sinister twist. With its phenomenal reviews and acclaim it's getting one could assume that this film is simultaneously 'funny, scary, and thought-provoking' (as rottentomatoes put it). Well just because a movie has racial themes does not all of a sudden make it a good movie. We get it! Some people are racist bigots. Just because this film depicts that (even in a satirical way) does not make it amazing. The film is a horror, right!? Well this film ain't scary in the least bit and Jordan Peele relies on cheap jump scares early on to keep the viewer on edge. 'Get Out' isn't necessarily bad; it does have some humor, intelligently thought-out character decisions (something uncommon in horror movies), and cleverly depicts a forgotten form of racism. But it all still isn't enough to overcome its absence of any real horror, its inability to say something new, and its violently empty conclusion that did not payoff in the slightest.",6,3,8,22 March 2017
A Quiet Place," If You Fart You're Dead
","John Krasinski takes after Jordan Peele as a successful comedic actor turned serious director. He shows some skill here with 'A Quiet Place,' but, like Peele, I can't help but feel a little disappointed with his work given the high praise from critics and the commercial success. 'A Quiet Place' showcases a truly brilliant concept, some effective moments of tension and emotion, but undercuts it with some serious bs writing, a dumb ending, and lack of true terror.A lot can be said about the concept of 'A Quiet Place.' When I first heard of this movie I was immediately sold. The concept is very original and quite brilliant: monsters that hunt by sound. One small noise could mean your end. 'A Quiet Place' delivers on some serious tense moments and even a few emotional shockwaves. The story is never boring and director John Krasinski is able to hold the audiences' attention throughout the short runtime, even more impressively done without the aid of dialogue. The performances were all believable and everyone did a good job acting scared s**tless. However, some of the writing was shoddy.*Spoilers* There are many moments when the monsters should have killed members of the family. When Emily Blunt gives birth without medical assistance while making no sounds at all (even from the freakin' newborn baby) as a monster is literally 10 feet from her is ridiculous and laughably bad. Better yet, she should have died when she was in the water bound basement with the monster swimming beneath her. There were five different times the kids should have died but the monsters were probably too lazy or dumb to kill them (the barn, the truck, the cornfield). Why did that idiot five-year-old not understand you can't make sounds? This is even dumber given he died on Day 89, meaning this idiot survived that long. BS! And worst of all the monsters' weakness was dumber than the aliens from 'Signs' (but I actually liked 'Signs'). All they had to do was play a queef frequency on a girl's hearing aid and then shotgun the monsters in the head. Wow, funny how no one else figured that out. I called bs on so many things I couldn't get as emotionally involved as I wanted too nor could I suspend my disbelief for proper enjoyment.'A Quiet Place' delivered on what the trailer promised minus actual horror or any real intelligence. Never during the film's runtime did I actually feel scared, I did jump, but good horror movies should scare you, not make you just jump. Though most movies nowadays don't scare people, especially people who are old cynical a**holes like me. Post Apocalyptic creature features don't scare me but some can gross me out like the hugely underrated 'The Mist.' I tend to soil myself over ghostly haunted house movies because now that is scary. In short, 'A Quiet Place' is a great idea, but disappointingly executed. If you want to make a good horror movie, it first needs to be intelligently thought out, then the scares will follow, maybe.",6,57,104,25 April 2018
X-Men: Apocalypse," The Critics are way Wrong! 'Apocalypse' Delivers
","The 8th installment of the X-men franchise (excluding 'Deadpool') blasts off with this big-budgeted extravaganza featuring the long awaited super-villain Apocalypse. After the huge success of 'Days of Future Past,' Bryan Singer gets another go at the franchise. The film successfully captures the spectacle, humor, heart, and awesomeness that filmgoers have come to expect from the X-men franchise further solidifying that Bryan Singer is THE MAN to direct the X-men movies.When 'X-men: Apocalypse' was prescreened it became bombarded with negative reviews -- leaving many (myself included) skeptical of the film's potential. Though what critics do not seem to get is that yes, 'Apocalypse' is flawed, although it still thoroughly entertained its audience from start to finish with awesome super-powered set pieces, thrilling action, delightful comic relief and cool cameos of beloved characters.The production team and the writers really made this film work. The performances were great from a very young and likable cast. The special effects were solid yet did rely a bit too much on CGI. The action was thrilling and provided audiences with tension through the threat of character deaths and other calamities present unlike in 'Civil War' where there was not much tension in the action (albeit still cool) because most of the fights took place between friends who we knew would never kill each other. The humor was sporadic yet still funny. X-men always makes great use of their one f-word limit. Finally the nuke scene with the subtle touch of Beethoven and the Quicksilver scene with the Eurythmics' 'Sweet Dreams' were just simply exquisite.Now Apocalypse did have flaws. There is no denying that. The timeline still has inconsistencies and continuity errors. While watching Apocalypse the average moviegoer probably will spend a good amount of time figuring out if the years and ages line up correctly. Like no way Nicholas Hoult looks twenty years older than he did in 'First Class.' Rottentomatoes went so far to call Apocalypse (the villain) cliché. Which is partially true because he wanted to destroy the world; which is what every super-villain wants to do nowadays! Also another review on IMDb said that all the X-men team up to defeat Apocalypse (the villain) by combining their powers in a Fant4stic kind of way. That is very true and the scene did seem like a bland and anticlimactic approach to kill off the big bad Apocalypse. Also since X-men is known for having an abundance of superheroes present: giving each one sufficient development is a task too difficult. Given this, certain characters had no development or little to do like Storm, Angel, Jubilee, and Psylocke -- whose only purpose for being there was to make teenaged boys lose their sh...In a nutshell 'X-men: Apocalypse' is another good addition to the X-men franchise that will continue to propel it forward in more ways than one. The production team did a great good of integrating action, emotional depth, resonant themes, and humor into a seamless whole. Hopefully the studio will keep Bryan Singer at the director's chair and if they even think about getting a new director, they just need to be reminded that the only good X-men movies came from him.",8,24,41,9 June 2016
1917," The Best WWI Film
","Sam Mendes' 1917 is a masterclass of filmmaking. With an Oscar-winning director and every famous British actor in smaller roles, 1917 does something unprecedented in a genre filled with masterpieces. It manages to tell a fresh story with breathtaking bravura. Featuring impeccably executed tracking shots, amazing soundtrack and beautiful cinematography - courtesy of the legendary Roger Deakins - 1917 stands as arguably the best World War I film, as well as one of the best war films ever made.The element that makes this film so unique is the long tracking shots. The film is made to look like one continuous take. Thanks to modern CGI, there are unnoticeable cuts in the film. But the execution of the film cannot be understated. The long takes, the authenticity, and practical sets add so much realism and intensity to the story that they make every frame immensely gripping. Never has there been a film about war, with such incredible and ambitious camerawork like 1917. Films exist to show, not tell, what an experience would be like. They emphasize tricking the audience for a split second, making them think they are there too. 1917 manifests this near perfectly.A drawback to the tracking shot format is that it does not capture the whole scope of battle. The format makes the audience's vision into this world limited, albeit, that vision is still epic, and breathtaking nonetheless. A film that showcases a truly epic scope with edits to multiple camera angles is Dunkirk. Though that film would have felt more complete if CGI was used to enhance the background and further surroundings. The only real complaint is during the night city sequence, George Mackay's character is running from German gunfire. He zigzags and evades bullets. The aim of the German soldiers is unrealistically bad. Perhaps a case of stormtrooper aim, but in a film so dead set on authenticity and realism, this did require a suspension of disbelief, if only for a brief moment.Two scenes that illustrate the power of the filmmaking craft are the night window scene, and the running scene. These two scenes showcase that transportive and magical feeling that the cinema can provide. The night window scene features beautiful cinematography, breathtaking visuals, and an amazing score. When those three things come perfectly together, an operatic sensationalism floods the screen. The running scene may be the most epic running in cinematic history. Yes, even better than Forrest Gump and Tom Cruise. The build-up to the running felt as realistic as the opening scene in Saving Private Ryan. These were two truly magical scenes.1917 is movie magic. It captures the thrilling, intense, and awe-inspiring resplendent of war. It truly felt like we the audience were in this moment. 1917 is more than a gimmick, but a powerhouse of filmmaking and raw visceral power.",9,2,3,15 May 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," 'Permission to get in an X-wing and blow something up' -Sums up the movie
","Star Wars: The Last Jedi deviates from the homage that was The Force Awakens in narrative and quality. Disney jumped the shark in this disappointing, forced, cartoonish joke. The Force Awakens mashed everything we loved about the originals (albeit, maybe too much) into a modern mix of pop entertainment. The Last Jedi subverts fan expectation in favor of a more logically inept, dramatically empty, and cringeworthy bore. The Last Jedi surprisingly didn't completely rehash The Empire Strikes Back; it took some risks and delivered a few surprises, but the overall execution was poor. Mark Hamill put in his best performance probably ever. The rest of the cast was fine except for a few distractingly annoying faces (Rose). Rian Johnson brought some humor, self-awareness, and philosophical dialogue surrounding the legend of the Jedi resulting in something new in a Star Wars movie. The storyline of Luke's resentment towards the Jedi and his mysterious past with Kylo Ren was compelling and the only promise the movie had going forward. However, everything quickly fell apart after the first act. *Spoilers Begin Here* 
The Last Jedi didn't take itself seriously enough by having just as much comedy and self-referential humor as an SNL sketch. Many of the jokes fell flat and completely killed whatever tension or emotion was already present (Poe's opening prank call, Luke's cheeseball one liners). The action was totally uncompelling and boring (didn't even have a lightsaber fight in a Star Wars movie). Anyone with an arc was unkillable, and the worse thing about it is that they constantly put the characters in absurdly dangerous situations and they pulled through completely unscathed - not due to the power of the mystical force but due to terrible writing. The Leia skywalking space scene is one of the most laughably bad scenes I've seen in a long time. For a second I thought I was watching Mary Poppins. The scene where Rose saves Finn by crashing into his spaceship should've killed them both but due to terrible writing and a lack of testicular fortitude, they both pull through unscathed just so Rose could start a Disneyfied love triangle. The whole Casino sequence with Rose and Finn was way too boring and bloated. The BB-8 controlling the AT-ST to save the day scene had my eyes rolling. What was up with the First Order and their aim trajectory? They couldn't just send in a faster ship to blow the Resistance out of space. And the fan-servicing Yoda scene lost me because Yoda looked so weird. Why couldn't they just use the same puppet? Rian Johnson took a serious risk during the obligatory confrontational scene - involving Rey, Kylo Ren, and Snoke - when Kylo Ren turns on his Emperor-esque master by using the Force to turn on a lightsaber cutting Snoke's body in half. I'd be lying if I said I saw that coming especially since Disney has one more movie planned in episode IX (and lots more planned after that). After that scene I couldn't help but feel disappointed because Snoke was hyped up in The Force Awakens to be some mysterious force-wielding badass with an interesting backstory. Refusing to develop Snoke and by him dying looking like a total moron was more anticlimactic than ballsy. Rian Johnson basically said 'F U' to JJ Abrams in how he completely strayed away from what was set up in The Force Awakens and by leaving not much left to work with in Episode IX. For instance, he kills off Snoke, leaving the conflicted Kylo Ren as the only villain, kills Luke, likely to come back as a spirit, leaves Leia alive, subjecting everyone to awkward CGI Leia, forces a weird and likely to be cringeworthy love triangle, outrages fans over the stupidity of this movie, and worst of all, probably alienated many Star Wars fans leaving them with nothing but a vengeful demand for the end of Star Wars.",3,1,2,1 January 2018
Silence," A Jarring and Challenging Experience
","Martin Scorsese's poetic passion project might be the greatest rendering of the human spirit in the last decade. The film explores faith, spirituality, love, betrayal, doubt and one's unyielding conviction to remain true to his beliefs. This film is not a typical box-office smasher because of its harsh subject matter and deeply rooted religious themes. However, it is still a powerful piece of cinema with phenomenal acting, and mind boggling religious actions, revelations and interpretations.The story follows two Jesuit priests and their quest to promote Christianity while trying to locate their mentor, Father Ferreira (Liam Neeson) who, according to rumors, 'surrendered the faith.' They travel to the barren 'swamp' of Japan where Christianity is outlawed, punishable by death. The priests endure hell through spiritual, psychological, and physical torment. They face starvation, persecution, and poor living conditions on top of doubting their own beliefs about whether God is even listening to them or if God exists at all. The film explores these themes with an open mind that could support or refute the notion of God's presence in the film. Scorsese treats the material with somber respect, ambiguity, and superb technical skill.To match the gravity of the religious themes and seriousness of the film is the fantastic acting, writing, cinematography, and directing. The previously mentioned are all great and should have all gotten Oscar nominations. How they didn't is truly a sin. Andrew Garfield kills it with another emotionally powerful performance. His performance carries the movie even during boring parts. It shows lots of similarity to his performance in 'Hacksaw Ridge' in how he plays a faithful man not willing to renounce his beliefs. Adam Driver was pretty good as well, though not on the same level as Andrew Garfield. Liam Neeson also delivers a morally complex performance that makes up for all his throwaway action movie roles. The Japanese actors especially the ones who played Inoue and Kichijiro were also very convincing yet it was hard to make out exactly what they were saying at times. This made it somewhat hard to get the full scope of what they were talking about in each given scene.*Spoilers and Sermonizing begin here* During the obligatory finale of Father Rodrigues' (Andrew Garfield) trial, he is faced with the heart wrenching choice of either denouncing God by trampling on a picture of Christ or remaining faithful which would lead to innocent Japanese Christians being tortured to death. Through persuasion of Father Ferreira's claims to denounce God and by presumably hearing God's voice telling him to trample on the image, Father Rodrigues tramples on the image of Christ. In doing so he saves Christian lives and ends up living a life of silent disposition towards the faith. He takes a Japanese name, job, and helps the elite find religious objects in the country to destroy.Now some may think that Father Rodrigues is a hero due to the fact that he publicly, yet maybe not privately, denounced God to save the lives of others. But according to the Catholic Church's teaching, committing an evil act (apostatizing) never justifies a good result (saving tortured Christians). But perhaps under the strenuous circumstances Father Rodrigues may have been pardoned especially since he heard the 'Voice of God.' But was that really God? Couldn't that have been his own insanity or maybe even the Devil's voice? Because would God really give contradictory instructions to apostatize after so many people had died already in the name of the faith. Father Rodrigues' denunciation resembles Saint Peter's with the cock crowing but unlike Saint Peter, Rodrigues never sought repentance. Although the very last image of the movie, in which Rodrigues is holding a tiny cross, helped mitigate his apostasy because it symbolized that his faith had never died and he practiced his faith in silence. Yet the faith is not something you practice internally. It's something you practiced externally with others. And what better way to externally share your faith then to openly die for it. *Spoilers and Sermonizing end here*'Silence' is an important film although it may not necessarily abide by Church teaching, it certainly gives Christians and maybe other religions things to ponder and reflect on to help them understand the moral boundaries of their faith. However, it can also be a dangerous film for general audiences because they may leave the film thinking that the actions displayed by Father Rodrigues are justifiable, and that religion is something that should be privatized in silence.",8,1,3,4 February 2017
Logan," Old Man Slo-gan
","Early reviews of 'Logan' had the film labeled as Marvel's Dark Knight. This brought me much excitement to hear such great things from a very anticipated movie. Then that excitement quickly turned to disappointment as I didn't come to think this film was anywhere near the excellence of 'The Dark Knight.' 'Logan' was quite unconventional for a superhero movie as in it wasn't a superhero movie but an antihero action drama. An antihero action drama that had a hollow story, slow pacing, frustrating ambiguity, redundant action, and ineffective emotional resonance.'Logan's' standout selling point from previous X-men/superhero films was its R-rating. The R-rated action and grittiness was cool and badass through the whole first act, then it became excessive and redundant as you watch Logan continuously slice through the same bones and limbs over and over again. 'Logan' did have similarities to 2015's best film (in my opinion) 'Mad Max: Fury Road' in how certain characters are forced to work together to find sanctuary from pursuing bad guys. I don't think Logan had a shot at ever being as good as 'The Dark Knight' but it could have been close to 'Mad Max: Fury Road' with badass no-nonsense characters, insane and brutally entertaining action, road-trip-like plot with danger looming at every corner, and maybe even some emotional gravitas. 'Logan' had the potential to match Mad Max but came up short in all of the previously mentioned areas.The thing that probably bothered me the most about 'Logan' was how bare, slowly paced, and empty the story was. The first act did a good job of setting up the story; Logan had to help a women and her daughter escape from some government agency experimenting on mutants with the help of Professor X and another mutant named Caliban. After the first act it seemed as if the story was going to be full of thrills, gore, emotion, interesting reveals of backstory and maybe even some twists. Yet, NO. What we got was a slow burner filled with the same slice 'em up action, no backstory or explanations to certain events, little to no humor, no grand set pieces, underdeveloped characters (like the main villain), and ineffective emotional appeal.Let's start with the backstory. First, all the mutants are dying and this is never touched upon thoroughly as to why. There is a scene at the end where a scientists says he is the one who is responsible for the earth being eradicated of mutants. And that's all; they don't bother explaining how or why. Then there is the Westchester incident, which director James Mangold was going to shoot but decided not to as it was implied that Xavier's seizures killed all of the X-men. Wouldn't that have been an interesting, gripping, and sad start to an already planned emotional movie if that scene was filmed? The counter to that is that it would've taken away from Professor X and Wolverine's emotional send offs (more on that later). Also why is Logan dying? Is the adamantium really poisoning him or are his healing powers just weakening? The movie has no interest in explaining this. And I won't even get started with the timeline as who knows what all preceded this movie.Then there was that ineffective emotional resonance. That basically means the movie didn't get me emotionally involved with the character deaths. First of all everyone knew that this was Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart's last outing in their respective roles. So them dying is not much of a surprise. And the way Professor X died was just so out-of- nowhere and dreamlike that I didn't feel anything when it happened. I didn't even know for sure if he was dead because the way it was filmed gave a pretense of a dream. Logan's death was also anticlimactic in how I didn't really feel any sadness for him when he died, although maybe some relief for the character for all the trauma he was going through. So instead of feeling sadness for the departure of these characters I felt relieved because they were so broken, lost, lifeless, and without purpose.'Logan' did have some redeeming qualities like the lead acting which was as good as it gets, its badass first act, the lead villain (Pierce) who was cool yet underdeveloped, and how it was a standalone movie not concerned with sequels and spinoffs. I said it earlier and I'll say it again 'Logan' was disappointing, nowhere near 'The Dark Knight,' and just bereft of quality storytelling, consistent thrills, and emotional grip.",6,5,11,5 April 2017
La La Land," The Best Picture Winner (for 30 seconds)
","'La La Land' is exactly what its whimsical and upbeat title would entail: a masterfully directed, wonderfully delightful, visually vibrant, and painstakingly realistic musical. The film's tremendous success and acclaim may leave some disappointed that are expecting the next great genre film. Although this film is not excellent, it certainly sings a catchy memorable tune.This is one of the few films I have seen that made me wish people could just randomly break out into a synchronized song and dance. The music is perfect for the magical vibrancy of the dance sequences. The director, Damien Chazelle, was definitely Oscar worthy especially by mimicking Alejandro González Iñárritu's tracking shots in 'Birdman' and 'The Revenant' -- tracking shots done right are always deserving of an Oscar. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone together create a convincing romance full of humor, hope, charm, and blistering sadness. The most surprising thing about 'La La Land' is its handling of themes such as dreams vs. reality, and how much it takes to chase those dreams. The filmmakers were not afraid to take risks with the story. Those risks paid off because the movie was bitterly realistic when it could have easily been cliché. The only problem with the film is that it took awhile for any kind of conflict/drama to emerge resulting in a semi dragged out narrative.For me, 'La La Land' was as good as a musical could have been (musicals are my least favorite genre). I enjoyed it for what it was, and it was definitely deserving of those fourteen Oscar nominations, and six wins. It's really the only film that actually made me want to start singing and dancing at the end of it. Too bad it got Steve Harvey'd.",7,1,7,1 March 2017
The Disaster Artist," What a Movie, James
","The Disaster Artist is the unbelievable true story behind the infamous making of The Room, one of the worst movies imaginable, which is considered by many to be so bad it's good. James Franco shines as the eccentric, egotistical, and unpredictable Tommy Wiseau, the director-writer-producer and star of The Room. The Disaster Artist not only works as a very enjoyable movie but also as a thoughtful node to filmmaking, dreams, and friendship.The cast is loaded with more celebrity cameos than the SNL Christmas episode. Many of them bring their star studded power but not much else. Seth Rogen, Zac Efron, and co-star Dave Franco are the only side performers who make the most of what they are given. Seth Rogen's critical condescension of Wiseau's unorthodox methods is very compelling especially since Rogen is normally typecast as the nice lovable stoner. Dave Franco nails Wiseau's real life best friend Greg Sestero, the sensible but loyal friend of Tommy. Zac Efron masters the very limited yet intimidating role of the irate drug dealer (the only good acting in The Room). And of course all the performers feed off of James Franco's masterful impersonation of Tommy Wiseau, which should have given him an Oscar nomination if not for Franco's sexual allegations.The Disaster Artist, like so many other based on a true story adaptations, coasts off the unbelievable hilarity of its true story. Some of the things that go down during the nightmarish production of this legendary movie are truly stranger than fiction, and help explain why The Room turned out as badly as it did. A minor misstep James Franco, as a director, took was bending some of the truth for dramatic effect. Greg's offer to be on Malcolm in the Middle was completely fabricated and untrue. They took poetic license to show you the divide that Tommy was causing to the relationship of himself and Greg, when more truthful subtleties would have been more effective. When people first heard about the creation of The Disaster Artist, they had to assume that it was going to be a spoof or condemnation of Tommy Wiseau. Instead, Franco presents Wiseau as a 'real human bean' (reference to The Room) full of positives and negatives. The story's heart stems from the friendship between Wiseau and Sestero. Their dedication and perseverance to make their dreams come true when everyone else doubted and rejected them allows the audience to feel and empathize with them. And the great irony of the whole thing is that Wiseau and Sestero achieved their goals of becoming famous actors (just not in the way they planned). The Disaster Artist is a film that in order to fully appreciate one must have seen or heard of The Room or Tommy Wiseau. The movie is still enjoyable, eye-opening, and surprisingly heartfelt, but not as effective for someone entering with no knowledge of The Room.",8,0,2,24 January 2018
Sausage Party," A Raunchfest with a lot more on its mind then sexual jokes and juvenile humor
","Seth Rogen's latest comedy is the first CGI animated feature length film to be rated R. And boy does it earn its R rating. The film's humor relies on the shock value of cute little food products cursing for the first two acts, which wears off quickly. The film doesn't really take off with the laugh out loud a-minute hysteria promised in the trailers until the third act. The introduction of the gum, the battle against the humans, and the climactic food orgy scene were brilliantly, shockingly, and outrageously hilarious.Now aside from the raunchiness and vulgarness rooted in this film, it had something meaningful to say about religion, social classes, ethnicity, and believing in things without any concrete proof. The film takes a somewhat atheist stance of the film's subjectivity, but recompenses it with a surprisingly well thought out message. The message promotes integration by saying that people should put aside their differences to work together regardless of race, class, religious or other firm held beliefs.On the surface, 'Sausage Party' may seem like a stoner's dream with raucous and perverted humor but against all odds justifies those obscenities with thoughtful remarks.",7,7,13,17 December 2016
Joker," Makes The Dark Knight seem light-hearted
","Joker is the latest iteration of the Clown Prince of Crime. After many different versions of the character, director Todd Phillips and star Joaquin Phoenix give their film a sense of identity by taking after Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight. They do this by making this version darker, and more realistic to even greater extremes. Joaquin Phoenix gives such a stellar performance, he'd make Heath Ledger proud. Joker hits, and hits hard. It works as a riveting character study, as well as an unnervingly realistic depiction of mental illness.To say Joker is controversial is an understatement. The film deals with real world issues like mental illness, poverty, class wars, child abuse, antisocial behaviors, and anarchy. Many people will probably be put off with how disturbing the subject matter is. Others will see the film as glorifying antisocial behavior. Some will see it as mere entertainment. One thing that almost everyone can agree upon is this: this is one dark movie. Some people are afraid this film might incite real life violence. This film is similar to Fight Club, in regard that it comprises of crazy people doing anarchist things for the audience's amusement. Some people have valid concerns, however, Joker, although fictional, is a film that represents reality. There have been rebellions, and riots before, as well as class wars, and incidents incited by mentally disturbed individuals. Though the exact events of Joker have never happened in real life, they easily could. This film like most films should be left to viewers discretion. Art represents reality, and reality isn't always pretty.Some people may also be turned off by Joker's realism. The main character Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), whose alter ego is the Joker, is a man down on his luck suffering from a mental illness. This movie doesn't hold back by showing mental illness in all its ugliness. Crazy people have graced the screen before, but real life crazy is not glamorous in the slightest sense. You couldn't help but feel unnerved and disturbed by the sheer ugliness of this crazy crime-ridden, messed-up take on Gotham city. The world is so dark, apathetic, and brutal. The streets are littered with rats and other filth, government programs get shut down do to a lack of funding, and depressing scenery of busy toxic city life cram the screen. One can't blame Arthur for losing his mind.Something the film excelled at was getting the audience to empathize or feel bad for Arthur, aka The Joker. His life and the world around him is so soul-crushingly harsh. When the film starts out, he is not that bad of a guy. He cares for his ailing mother, works unfulfilling jobs, and fights his mental illness. The society crumbling around him creates the Joker. It's very realistic to see Joker unintentionally and indirectly starting all this mayhem and anarchy. He is just the straw that broke the camel's back. Joaquin Phoenix plays the Joker extremely well. He is more of a mentally ill man wearing clown makeup than a larger-than-life supervillain. Joaquin plays the character in the shadow of Robert De Niro's Travis Bickle from Taxi Driver, except Joaquin's character is even more socially isolated and disturbed.Joker is heavily influenced by Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy - two films that star Robert De Niro. Both of Scorsese's films deal with a mentally unhinged loner acting out against society in violent or antisocial ways. Joker tries to be a combination of the two films while molding itself into Batman lore. Joker successfully weaves its influences together without being derivative. If there are any criticisms, they are all minor - typical movie sins you find in most movies. To name a few, how does Arthur sneak a gun onto a Talk Show and how does he sneak into the Wayne theater so easily. Criticisms apart, along with two great Scorsese films, Joker stays with you with its compelling performances, disturbing subject matter, and shocking moments. Joker gets under your skin and lingers there.",8,4,6,11 January 2020
The Wolf of Wall Street," Leo's Best Performance to Date
","'The Wolf of Wall Street' brings together once again the dynamic duo of actor Leonardo DiCaprio and legendary director Martin Scorsese. This time around Martin Scorsese delves into familiar territory by going back to his crime-ridden roots. Leonardo DiCaprio stars as real life stock-broker Jordan Belfort who quickly becomes infatuated with the corrupt Wall Street lifestyle and over time climbs the Wall Street ladder.DiCaprio's character comes from humble beginnings but once he is sucked into the lifestyle of the Wall Street world he develops into a wicked and despicable character who commits every vice known to man. Belfort is brought to life by Leonardo DiCaprio's exuberant and flexible performance. This is Leonardo DiCaprio's movie and he takes the bull by the horns and puts this movie on his back. The fact that Leo did not win an Oscar for this role is a travesty. Honestly his performance was way better than McConaughey's from 'Dallas Buyers Club.' Speaking of McConaughey his little cameo was one of the best scenes in the film.Leo was not the only standout performance in this movie but he still was the best. The acting overall in this movie is fantastic and the over the top debauchery portrayed by the characters creates a contagious vibe of highly energetic acting that everyone seems to get in on from Jonah Hill to Matthew McConaughey to newcomer Margot Robbie and even Shane from 'The Walking Dead.' Everyone pulls their weight and creates their own little moments of hilarity that add to the story. This movie was one of the funniest and most entertaining movies of the year. Scorsese really tries to portray every crazy scenario in the most over the top kind of way which just makes it even more unbelievable that this all actually happened.Now let's look at the flaws of the film. First being it was overlong and a little drawn out at moments. It was like watching the extended version of something. The first two hours just shows Belfort's rise as a broker to his frequent spurts of drug inducing mind boggling shenanigans with his pals. This starts to wear on the audience because we have seen so much of it it starts to become redundant. Then there is the final third of the movie which shows the downfall of Belfort's empire. This changes from the formula of the first two hours because this is where most of the drama is present. The first hour is a blast because we are not quite ready for what will be thrown our way and it also comprises of the most memorable scenes.In short 'The Wolf of Wall Street' is a very funny, entertaining, eye opening, quotable, energetic, overlong, somewhat redundant escapade into high life excess filled with amazing performances. Also to note that this is NOT for kids. 8/10",8,2,6,21 July 2015
"Hail, Caesar!"," Solid vegetable movie yet disappointing for Coen Brothers Standards
","The latest film by Hollywood's best directing pair (Joel and Ethan Coen) 'Hail, Caesar!' features the best ensemble cast displayed in the Coen Brothers' career thus far. The film contains all the classic trademarks of a Coen Brothers picture, however, the movie is polarizing and something that only 50+ year olds can enjoy with its dated jokes, esoteric references, and lack of a focused narrative.'Hail, Caesar!' starts out strong with some finely tuned humorous scenes bolstered by sharply written dialogue by the Coen Brothers. The premise, as shown in the trailer, is another abduction/ransom plot with a clever Coen Bros twist. As the movie goes on the plot becomes more stretched out with subplots that stray away from the main plot/focus. This leaves a handful of moviegoers (anyone under about 40-years-old in this case) bored with nothing but hit-or-miss 50's humor and cryptic references to entertain. The story did not have enough spark and vigor to carry its rather short runtime unlike what The Coen Bros did in 'Fargo,' and 'No Country for Old Men,' nor did it achieve the comedy gold in 'The Big Lebowski,' and even the underrated 'Burn After Reading.' Although it did have all the fine performances, deft dialogue, colorful cinematography, and exquisite period detail that all the films listed above had. It's a shame that all the talent and flair the Coen Brothers could muster up only produced an iffy crime story without any dramatic heft in its watered-down plot with dated jokes only 50-year-olds would get. Yet it still would be unfair to say this movie was garbage because of its filmmaking craft. The Coen Brothers really are some of the most competent and distinctive directing voices. Only if next time they could make a more universal and comprehensive picture that would captivate audiences of all ages instead of just anyone familiar with 1950's pop culture.",6,1,1,5 July 2016
Kong: Skull Island," B-movie plot meets A-movie budget with A-list actors = One helluva Good Time
","'Kong: Skull Island' delivers on what a B-movie monster flick with an A-movie budget should be: a well paced, action-packed, visually competent, comedic, and an all around fun time. What helps set it apart from forgettable/mediocre monster flicks like 2014's 'Godzilla' is its large and highly entertaining cast of talented A-listers that include Samuel L. Jackson, John Goodman, Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larson, John C. Reilly, the reuniting of 'Straight Outta Compton's' Corey Hawkins and Jason Mitchell, and the box office King himself, Kong.The standout is John C. Reilly whose introduction breathes new energy into the movie just as things were about to turn dull. His character provides plenty of comic relief, interesting exposition, and a surprise emotional moment. Samuel L. Jackson almost steals the show as a vengeful, trigger-happy and profane army officer who has the only logically-sound motives. Also John Goodman and Corey Hawkins play scientists out to prove the existence of Kong and monsters. Brie Larson and Tom Hiddleston have an interesting scene together in the beginning of the film but after that are kinda wasted with no real development. I had trouble remembering their names by the time the end credits rolled, but their charisma and sublime hair were enough to compensate. Jason Mitchell and Shea Whigham provided some nice banter that helped put a face on the faceless soldiers. Then there is the real star: Kong! The monster battles were visually delightful as well as inventively awesome -- like when Kong uses a propeller as a morning star. Shout out to the writers for not wasting everyone's time with a rehashed romance between Kong and the blonde damsel in distress. We had enough of that in Peter Jackson's interpretation.In conclusion, 'Kong: Skull Island' is an entertaining ride from start to finish that will thrill/entertain/amuse those willing to turn their brains off.",7,4,7,29 April 2017
Prometheus," Big Things (Alien and Aliens) have small beginnings (Prometheus)
","Ridley Scott's divisive prequel to the Alien franchise was a bit of a mixed bag among critics and audiences. Prometheus -- the story of a group of scientists searching for their creator after finding a clue to his whereabouts -- was considered, by some, to be mysterious, ambitious, and full of deep philosophical questions that manifest the roots of science fiction. While others saw it as a slog that didn't answer any of the big questions nor give any payoff. There are a few elements that everyone can agree on: gorgeous visuals, solid acting, excellent cinematography and an overwhelming sense of adventure and mystery. Prometheus, like the Alien Franchise, combines elements from science-fiction, horror, and mystery. Though the question here is how well does it blend the above mentioned, and does it blend them skillfully enough to compensate for a lot of unanswered questions, illogical decision making, and disappointed audiences.The science fiction aspect of this film is the strongest out of the three. Instead of completely focusing the film's plot on 'stupid' humans getting eaten by monstrous aliens, Ridley Scott takes a deeper, philosophical and even theological standpoint on the origins of mankind while sprinkling layers of Alien mythology on top. The film raises questions such as: is there a God? Is there life after death? If the 'engineers' created humans then who created them? If the 'engineers' created humans then why do they want to kill them? Much like the renowned 2001: A Space Odyssey, Prometheus asks these kinds of questions, but leaves most of the answers to the viewer's imagination, inevitably sparking loads of discussions and theories unless the answers come up in future sequels. Consensus: as a science-fiction film, Prometheus succeeds. Just like the Alien Franchise, Prometheus had horror and suspense. Our characters trek down long and dark corridors in an alien-like pyramid. An idiot biologist gets killed by a fiendish snake-worm hybrid. Tom Hardy's twin morphs into a monster after being exposed to an alien-goo. Noomi Rapace's character must get an emergency caesarean to rid herself of a xenomorph octopus. An 'engineer' tries to kill the humans when he encounters them -- kinda a scary thought if your creator tries to murder you when he first sees you. Then that same 'engineer' is eaten by the adult version of the xenomorph octopus. The only horror moment that can contend with the mighty Alien is the squirm-inducing caesarean scene. Other than that scene the horror does not match the scares of the original Alien nor the action-suspense of Aliens. Consensus: as a horror film, Prometheus is solid.Prometheus builds up a lot of mystery with undeniably no payoff. It doesn't answer any of its big questions nor does it, at times, make sense logically. Prometheus works as a sci-fi for having these questions but it is the responsibility of the mystery aspect to answer them. A film can leave secondary elements a mystery (the original Alien did), but it cannot leave the core of the film one. Some questions they didn't bother to answer include: Who created the engineers? Why do the engineers hate humans? What originally happened on the planet LV-223 to cause the outbreak that resulted in dead engineers? Why did the engineers leave a cave drawing leading to a weapons facility? What is the black goo? Does it change someone's DNA or just make them murderous zombies? Or both? Prometheus also had a lot of questionable breakdowns in logic like: Why did that biologist try and pet that fiendish snake-worm hybrid? How did that biologist and the geologist get lost with all that equipment while being in constant communication with the ship? Why did Idris Elba's character show no concern for the welfare of these two men? Why did the crew sign up for this 4-year expedition without any briefing until right before the mission started? Why does Charlize Theron's character only run in straight lines? Consensus: as a mystery film, Prometheus disappoints.Because of Prometheus' lack of answers, it frustrated/confused audiences. After doing some extensive research for answers, a lot of them can be answered through deleted scenes, interviews with the director and writers themselves, or from the Prometheus website which gives a lot of character background. But a movie shouldn't require you to do outside research for answers. The film itself should have them somewhere in there overtly or covertly. Prometheus is an incredibly divisive movie and although it shows a lot of skill with visuals, acting, and in the genre of science fiction, it comes up short in the more important areas. The film seems as if it doesn't know what it wants to be. Is it a direct prequel to Alien? Is it a deep sci-fi mystery on the most profound questions? Is it a spin off to the Alien franchise? Is it just another deep space horror movie with grisly results, or is it trying to do too many things in too little time. Consensus: Prometheus is a visually appealing ambitious sci-fi that tries to jumble too many things and loses its footing falling into a dimension of mediocrity. 6.5/10",7,1,3,24 May 2017
Black Panther," Most Overrated Movie of 2018
","Marvel's 'Black Panther' treads new grounds as it takes on racial and political problems, as well as being a blockbuster action film. 'Black Panther' works as a positive medium for building bridges; it has a good message, but is not a good movie. Once you look past the political and social ambitions the film aims for, it's just another by-the-numbers predictably average comic book movie. The only real impressive thing about the movie is its villain. Michael B. Jordan was forced to carry the movie, and when he wasn't on screen it was painfully boring (most of the first hour). His villainous Erik Killmonger stands as one of the better MCU villains. His ferocious yet sympathetic portrayal of a vengeful man gave the movie the spark it needed to avoid sucking. Also his super fit body jacked the eye candy way up (for a second I thought I was gay). However, Killmonger suffers from abrupt Dr. Evil syndrome. His prime motivation is to give all black people around the world specialized weapons made from vibranium, a mined substance in the technologically advanced Wakanda, to seize social dominance over any non-black person. I'm surprised he did not ask for laser beams attached to the heads of sharks. I'm sure the vibranium is capable of such matters. Without the emergence of Michael B. Jordan's more interesting villain, 'Black Panther' is a dreadfully formulaic, predictable and borderline boring superhero movie. The characters, outside Killmonger, are pretty forgettable and uninteresting. The comic relief is very inconsistent; a few jokes hit while most completely miss the mark. The CGI is noticeably sub-par. The action sequences are not poorly done but don't leave a lasting impression. Many of the film's plot points you can see coming from a mile away (T'Challa vs. Killmonger part I and II, M'Baku's entrance, T'Challa's return). 'Black Panther' is a movie that is getting such spectacular reviews from critics because it has a socially proactive message, touches upon real world issues, and nearly has an unprecedented all black cast in a superhero movie. Judging it as a piece of entertainment, it is wickedly underwhelming, predictable and disappointing.",5,1,2,9 August 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Deus Ex Marthina
","2016's most highly anticipated movie 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' followed in the formula of previous special effects-driven action films: good build-up and tension followed by CGI-ridden cartoonish shenanigans. Some films that have gone down this treacherous path are 'The Matrix Revolutions,' 'Man of Steel,' 'The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug' and 'The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies.' BvS squandered its usage of two of the most iconic and popular comic book characters in this middling adaptation filled with way too much CGI and one of the worst deus ex machina moments ever that all mounted up to make the film seem just as cartoonish, rushed and unrealistic as a Batman or Superman cartoon. BvS started out pretty good. The film's analysis and interpretation of the whole Superman dilemma was handled very well. Characters debating about what should be done with the 'metahuman thesis' were done in a compelling and very believable manner. The Batman scenes were pretty cool and offered for a darker and more brooding Batman. As if he was not a dark enough character in 'The Dark Knight' film series. The film's best moments were the debates over whether or not people needed a Superman, the build-up right before Batman and Superman fight, the fight itself, and the biblical philosophies regarding a Superman-like figure.Now time for the many flaws this film had. First Zack Snyder focused way to much on CGI and action. The story was convoluted and incomplete. Some scenes were lacking or missing crucial plot points that were probably left out only to be seen in the Ultimate Edition. It also featured bizarre dreams that wasted valuable screen time with little to offer but hazy character motivations. Also the CGI action sequences were a bit cartoonish and did not offer any payoff, although the dark overtones in the story may overshadow the cheesiness in the action for some. Overall, the movie's action did not capture the same exhilaration, realism, and awesomeness as depicted in the previous 'Dark Knight' films. The performances in BvS fluctuated from unexpectedly good to expectedly annoying. Ben Affleck was a very good Batman and brought a different yet more malevolent feel to the character. Henry Cavill was solid as Superman yet nothing awe inspiring. The real talking point here is Jesse Eisenberg's flamboyant Lex Luthor. Eisenberg really goes all out with this performance but falls flat because he is downright annoying, and almost cringeworthy at parts. The scene that perfectly epitomizes this is when he introduces Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent at the party towards the beginning of the film. His high-pitched voice, awkward mannerisms, and weird acknowledgment of journalist Clark Kent (who no one should care about at that point in the movie) were just rubbish!For all the flaws in BvS nothing could compensate for the absolutely terrible Martha scene that took place during the climactic Batman and Superman fight. Batman was ready to kill Superman yet stopped because his and Superman's mother share the same first name. Then all of a sudden they become friends. Like what the hell was that! They could have at least had a conversation that delved into how Lex Luthor was manipulating them to fight or how Batman realized in that moment he was turning into the villain he was trying to eradicate for the last twenty years. But no, the writers half-assed that whole scene and boy did it backfire. That scene's stupidity took away from the spectacle of the following scene where Batman kicks the holy hell out of some henchmen. Like honestly what were the writers thinking. Did they hire Tommy Wiseau to write that scene?'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' had potential to be a good superhero movie. Never during the film's long runtime did it reach a state of awesomeness or pure cinematic spectacle. It had many good parts but were let down by bombastic action, an annoying villain, convoluted motivations and schemes, and finally by 'Martha!' Hopefully DC can learn from this movie so we do not have to deal with the same absurdities in the upcoming DC films.",6,2,3,27 July 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Star Wars: The Inner Nerd Awakens
","The seventh chapter of the Star Wars Saga unfolds with this highly anticipated sci-fi extravaganza. The Force Awakens deviates from the CGI fest and subpar writing of the prequels and mimics the mythology and realistic practical effects of the original trilogy. Although a lot of people have a problem with the similarities between The Force Awakens and A New Hope; The Force Awakens is still an awesome riveting sci-fi spectacle filled with explosively stunning visuals, impeccable pacing, great comedic moments, and a somewhat similar yet still refreshingly kinetic story with old faces along side new ones.J.J. Abrams and the cast did a great job reviving a franchise no one thought could be resurrected. It accomplished itself by being an exciting addition to the Star Wars Saga while refraining from the mistakes of the prequels and by being a faithful homage to the originals. The Force Awakens succeeded where the prequels failed, as in: (1) The Writing- which was a big time improvement over the prequels and matched the originals in wit. (2) The Acting- the acting was fine and offered the new characters like Rey, Finn, and Poe some crucial moments to shine. (3) Usage of practical effects- probably the biggest difference which added a more nostalgic and realistic spin on the action offering more excitement. (4) The chemistry between characters- was another big improvement and offered a more believable connection the characters had with each other. (5) The story- the detailed matured perspective on the story was far superior than the much criticized prequels. Now a lot of people on IMDb are having problems with the unoriginality of The Force Awakens. They believe it is a remake of A New Hope with new characters and better effects. Basically some of their complaints regarding originality and other aspects of the film are: (1) The whole thing with the new Death Star (Death Planet) (2) How the Resistance goes about destroying the Death Star (Death Planet) (3) The new characters are basically just an update of the old characters. (Kylo to Darth Vader) (4) Kylo Ren and his fight with Rey. (5) Not filling in the 30 year gap. (6) No backstory to relationships like Han and Kylo Ren.(7) Little character development for characters like Rey and Finn.(8) Some poor dialogue with an unrealistic bond between Rey and Finn.Some rebuttals to the above are that yes, The Force Awakens was flawed due to its unoriginality but some can argue that it was trying to do this so that J.J. and Disney could bring Star Wars back to the glory days of the original trilogy, yet still be exciting and fresh in its own way. The flaws in The Force Awakens were no where near as bad as IMDb users are making them out to be. The film's flaws, overshadowed by its awesomeness, should not be deemed of hatred especially if you are a Star Wars fan. Now counters to the points made above.(1) Maybe the First Order was trying to be exactly like The Empire and needed a Death Planet to be just as powerful as the old empire. May be unoriginal but kind of plausible for the story if you think about it.(2) The plan the Resistance comes up with is quite similar to A New Hope. Send in a bunch of X-Wings to find a weakness on a planet destroying battle station before they blow up the rebel home planet. Honestly the writers know this and even poke fun at themselves by just having the characters do the same thing. Has no one seen '22 Jump Street,' because it is using the same humor as that in this one particular sequence. (3) Well most of the new characters are descendants to the old ones so there must be similarities and influences that run through the family. (4) Now this was hard to believe Rey kicking Kylo Ren's ass with limited training but maybe Kylo Ren had limited training too. Maybe he prematurely ditched Luke through his arrogance and became totally fascinated with the dark side of the force that lead him to misjudge his destiny with Luke and Jedi training. (Just a theory of course) (5) Disney might make prequels or they might explain that gap in the upcoming sequels. (6) Again this can be further expanded upon in upcoming movies as long as we got the gist of the relationship, which we did! (7) Rey and Finn were developed just enough to care about them while still leaving us mystified and even more excited to see their characters in the upcoming films. (8) Rey and Finn may have had a few bad line exchanges but mostly it was good. The good overcame the bad.In conclusion, Star Wars: The Force Awakens lived up to the hype and offered Star Wars fans a fun fast pace entertaining sci-fi epic with great action, new characters, nice comic relief, exciting story, nostalgia, and heart felt moments that touched, mesmerized and even shocked at moments. The film was a big improvement over the prequels and got right what they did wrong. Though The Force Awakens was not perfect and was never going to be, but succeeded in what it was supposed to do -- Rock our inner nerd with Star Wars galore!",9,5,54,14 January 2016
Life," In Life no one can hear you scream, because you won't
","'Life' reunites Ryan Reynolds and the writers of 'Deadpool' to bring a tense claustrophobic sci-fi horror to the big screen. 'Life' draws inspiration from 'Alien,' yet doesn't quite match Alien's revolutionary effects, inventiveness, and iconic status. Although given what this film was set out to do, failing to live up to 'Alien' is understandable. However, this film was tense and well-directed, but really didn't offer anything new. There wasn't even an attempt at character development, the first act bored, and the movie was quite predictable and by-the-numbers. Oh and bereft of any scares or real horror unless you've never seen 'Alien' or any sci-fi horror flick. And on top of all of that the ending made no sense. Hopefully 'Alien: Covenant' will show them how it's done.",6,1,6,7 May 2017
Deadpool," 'Cabin in the Woods' of Superhero Movies
","'Deadpool' joyfully and audaciously pokes fun at other superhero flicks while being one in itself. The film's rapid-fire humor, self referential gags, and ballsiness satirize not only superhero movie clichés but also movie clichés as well. Yet what holds it back from greatness is its superficially structured story, unimpressive CGI action, ineffective resonance and bland one-dimensional characters excluding the titular character.'Deadpool' tries desperately to stand out, and to not be seen as just another superhero movie. Well outside of the self referential humor, pop culture references, and the always funny Deadpool, the film becomes exactly what it is so afraid of being labeled as: just another over-the-top, oversaturated, and superficial action extravaganza. The only thing that saved 'Deadpool' from being another mediocre excursion into the marvel canon was its non-stop jokes and compelling freedom to do whatever it wanted.'Deadpool' could have been great if the writers put the same amount of time, effort, and creativity into the plot, and characters as they put into their jokes. The characters were just same old same old clichés particularly the forgettable villain. The character motivations behind Deadpool getting revenge were silly and almost absurd. Like seriously, he signed up for what happened to him. Also the movie does not suffer from the occasional 'save the world' plot, but maybe just as unoriginal, it suffers from the 'save the girl, kill the bad guy' plot. The worst sin of all is that even though the movie pokes fun at these clichés, it still ends up being guilty of them. With all this said 'Deadpool' is still an enjoyably funny fast pace superhero flick that most will like for its new and refreshing humor.",7,5,16,2 March 2016
John Wick: Chapter 2," Don't f$&k with John Wick
","John Wick: Chapter 2 improves over the first one by not having an as ridiculous plot -- instead of killing a bunch of people over his dog, John Wick kills a bunch of people to settle a score. It also supplied a few laughs -- some unintentional -- masterfully choreographed fight scenes, and Keanu Reeves being cool by practically saying nothing. However, it shat out more of the same video game plot, stormtrooper aim, repetitive action, absurd assassin world building and emo haircuts.",6,1,2,10 July 2017
Mad Max: Fury Road," Awesome, but what could have been...
","'Mad Max: Fury Road' is without a doubt one of the greatest achievements of cinema captured on film in recent years. The explosive exhilarating action sequences were masterfully directed by yes, a true mastermind and genius George Miller. George Miller, creator of the Mad Max trilogy with Mel Gibson, brings his franchise back from the dead with this monster of a movie. The film takes place in a post apocalyptic wasteland filled with mad (crazy) people. In the very beginning of the film we are introduced to a tortured and damaged man named Max Rockatansky. Max is our protagonist and hero of the story. He is haunted by his past and his failure to save the ones he loved. He is the definition of a loner until he is captured and taken back to 'The Citadel.' He then gets involved with the chaos when he meets Charlize Theron's character Imperator Furiosa; a one armed woman looking for redemption. Together they team up to take the abused wives of the main villain, Immortan Joe, to find asylum out in the desert. Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron are perfect fits for the lead roles due to their wide ranged acting skills particularly those of Charlize Theron.As every moviegoer should know a movie villain is very important to the film because not only does he or she help drive the plot but can also be responsible for the movie's awesomeness. We are in for a treat with Immortan Joe who you can tell by just looking at him that he is one evil and sinister dude. Immortan Joe presents himself as a god living amongst his people. He hogs all of the valuable resources in the wasteland and this gives him his power. His war boys are so loyal to him that they will do anything for him like the League of Shadows guys from 'The Dark Knight Rises.' The practical effects of the movie create an old school kind-of-vibe throughout the movie but it pays off well because it is so realistic and looks way better than computer animated special effects. The practical effects look fantastic in this film and hopefully it inspires future filmmakers to use this technique rather than CGI. Don't get me wrong, CGI can be a valuable tool but it is overused in film today. The stunts were also spectacular to look at and honestly some of the best I have ever seen. Overall, the action of the movie in one word: Amazing!!! This movie will surely bring in Oscar nominations. So aside from the cool characters, special effects, directing technique, and action: what a movie really needs to be a masterpiece is a great story. Though 'Mad Max: Fury Road' did not slack in this category; it was just to a minimum. The story was basic and presented in a rare way without any real exposition, making it a little difficult to get a good grasp on the story. Though this is not necessarily a bad thing. It was just different. Miller's clever approach to this made the beginning to be somewhat complex as it forced the audience to figure out this world without any real introduction.Also Miller wanted to tell the story with the visuals, so there is not much dialogue throughout the film. So pretty much the opposite of a Quentin Tarantino Movie. Again not necessarily a bad thing because the plot still flows well; although it does not allow for a lot of development of many cool characters. Miller once said in an interview, 'They won't have to read the subtitles in Japan.' This will surely make it easier on foreigners but has no factor in making the movie better. Also the movie did not have the most memorable dialogue, but was more memorable than the old Mad Max films. Some lines tried too hard to be movie catchphrases while others worked perfectly for the scene.Though as awesome as 'Mad Max: Fury Road' was I cannot give it a 10 because of its basic story. I wish the movie was a little longer with more development, dialogue and focus on the story, so it would make the movie even more epic with higher stakes, purpose, and emotional appeal. Compared to other action classics like 'The Matrix' and 'The Dark Knight' which had great stories along with groundbreaking action; 'Mad Max: Fury Road' did not quite reach those heights but reached farther heights than most action movies of recent years.'Mad Max: Fury Road' had potential to be one of the greatest action movies of all time but just barely missed. At the end I found myself saying 'really that was it,' and I wanted more. Still 'Mad Max: Fury Road' is an awesome movie that most will enjoy and appreciate. Can't wait for the sequels. 9/10",10,2,9,26 June 2015
Hacksaw Ridge," One of the Most Inspiring Movies of all Time
","Mel Gibson (Braveheart, The Passion of the Christ) marks his ten year absence from cinema with this extraordinary fact-based war film Hacksaw Ridge. The film is a welcome return to form for Mel Gibson whose directorial efforts have been non-existent as of late largely due to controversy. Gibson expertly crafts some of the most immersive, visceral, and gut-wrenchingly intense war scenes since Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan, while also telling the incredibly inspiring story of one man's challenge to stay true to his convictions while becoming an unlikely hero in the process.The first half of the film chronicles the struggles, tribulations, and trials of a real-life pacifist named Desmond T. Doss (played by Andrew Garfield). Doss joins the army to aid in the war effort after the massacre at Pearl Harbor. Though Doss condemns violence, will not touch a gun, and tries to become a medic as opposed to fighting. He endures vicious beatings from his comrades, animosity from his commanding officers, and unjust charges brought against him for not going along with basic rifle training and the violence that will inevitably follow. He later becomes court-martialed for his alleged defiance of a commanding officer and then thrown in prison. After his trial, the army finally gives into his wishes and sends him into battle without the need to bear arms. Doss's whole struggle is the epitome of conviction as he stands up for what he believes in no matter the cost. Doss's conflict was very well portrayed, offered some compelling drama and the fact that this all actually happened made it even more credible. Though the first half of the film had some minor hiccups with the cliché love story, the questionable military ethics displayed by the commanding officers (such as soliciting Doss to quit the army with a draft in effect) and finally by some campy dialogue which throughout its length does not feature one single f-word given the grittiness and cruelty known to be present in army boot camps and on the battlefields.Following Doss's struggle at home, the story quickly jumps into the battle of Okinawa. The war scenes are absolutely relentless in its depiction of warfare. It offers some incredible intensity and masterfully choreographed battle scenes. Mel Gibson thrusts the viewer right into the action just as effectively as Steven Spielberg did with Saving Private Ryan. The viewer feels the shock of every explosion, every bullet zipping past the soldiers' heads, and every man bellowing in pain. It is simply beautiful chaos.Though what helps evoke humanity in the awful savagery depicted in the war scenes is Private Doss. Private Doss risks his own life multiple times to save the lives of others. When everyone else retreated, he stayed behind to save many people including some of the enemy soldiers all without firing a single shot. Doss reflects a Christ-like figure by the light shining on his back, by helping a blind man see, and also by washing off all the blood and dirt on him metaphorical to the Baptism of Jesus. Just like Jesus, Doss saved many people and also stood for what was right even if it lead to incarceration or death. Gibson told Doss's story with accuracy, grace, grit, and tremendous technical skill all without being excessively sentimental, preachy with Christianity, or overly glamorous with the war scenes.Private Doss was portrayed fantastically by Andrew Garfield whose work may warrant an Oscar nomination. The casting was surprisingly great as it featured many actors normally typecast for roles almost the opposite they played in this film for example: Vince Vaughn as an intimidating yet wise-cracking drill sergeant, Hugo Weaving as an abusive yet regretful father, and Andrew Garfield himself from a comic book hero to a real life one. Everyone in the film did a great job at personifying their characters and breaking down their own previous stereotypes.Hacksaw Ridge is the most harrowing, terrifying and visceral war film since Saving Private Ryan, while being the most triumphant, inspirational and feel-good movie since Rocky or even Rudy. Mel Gibson has marked a comeback with this film and hopefully he keeps making pictures as urgent as this. The film definitely deserves Oscar attention come award season.",9,4,8,19 November 2016
Alien: Covenant," A Gorgeously Thrilling 'Detour'
","Ridley Scott's long awaited sequel to Prometheus delivers an Alien-esque thriller as well as a continuation of Prometheus. Alien: Covenant is more of an Alien film -- made obvious by the title -- which for better or worse, is ultimately not the direction this film should have gone in. However, it does provide a lot of thrills, wonderfully stunning set pieces, and Michael Fassbender acting opposite Michael Fassbender. Yet at the same time it spews out a load of disposable characters, predictable outcomes, and just an overall lack of mythological depth that made Prometheus so interesting.Some of the best aspects of Alien: Covenant are its visuals which can't be beat. The sets are so tangible it's like you are actually visiting another world. The performances are really good especially Michael Fassbender's masterful reprisal of David, the curiously malevolent android from Prometheus, and his new character Walter, a much more emotionally toned down android. His characters/performances really gave this film some much needed depth (if only briefly explored) with the philosophies regarding creators and their creations. Also there's Danny McBride whose natural comedic presence is a joy to watch. Ridley Scott expertly crafts some intensely thrilling scenes the Alien franchise is known for. There's a few alien body bursting scenes as well as a badass robot fight between Michael Fassbender's two characters. Ridley Scott really excels with creating dazzling visuals, gut-wrenching intensity, and horrific xenomorph scares.After the criticism Prometheus received it's safe to assume that Ridley Scott took that to heart and just wanted to deliver the fans what they wanted: a superficial bloodbath with gore gore and more gore to scare the bejesus out of the audience. That only can take this movie so far; it needs more story and mystery. Alien: Covenant, simply, failed as a sequel to Prometheus where it didn't answer the questions raised in that film nor did it pick up its storyline as effectively as it should. It only created more questions like: are there more engineers out there? Why does David go psychotic and kill all the engineers? Why does David have long hair if he is a robot with artificial hair? Why was the engineers home planet not picked up by the scanners? Why did the space colonists not wear any helmets while trekking on an alien planet? Why is James Franco even in this movie?Alien: Covenant is too visually stunning, thrilling, and Michael Fassbendery to be bad. Although it was too predictable, superficial, and simple to be memorable. It was a detour literally and figuratively. These colonists literally pit stop on a newly discovered planet only to meet their untimely demise. Figuratively not much is answered or expanded upon from Prometheus and Alien lore. Ridley Scott thought he could just distract us from unoriginality by just throwing in as much xenomorphs, gore, visuals, thrills, and Michael Fassbender as possible. And, surprisingly, somehow, he makes it work.",7,3,14,1 June 2017
The Martian," Saving Private Watney
","The Martian features an a-list cast with acclaimed director Ridley Scott at the helm. Together they bring Andy Weir's best selling novel of the same name to the big screen. Matt Damon plays overly optimistic Mark Watney who unfortunately gets stranded on Mars after a horrific storm leaves him abandoned and presumed dead by his fellow astronauts. As depicted in the trailer, Matt Damon's character is faced with the near impossible predicament of having to survive on Mars with limited food supply while also trying to find a way to contact NASA for a rescue mission. With that in mind one could reasonable expect exciting set pieces with peril at every turn while combining dramatic intensity with clever comic relief. However, The Martian simply failed to live up to these expectations and was mostly a disappointment.Now what exactly made this so disappointing? Firstly, Matt Damon's character failed to bring any seriousness given his situation of inevitable doom. His character seemed so upbeat which did add to the comedic effect of the film but it was just so overdone it took away from the movie being dramatic and intense. Though Matt Damon did a good job portraying his character, the overly gleeful Watney just simply was not the right fit to make this movie dramatic. All of this added up to the film being so unrealistically upbeat that nothing bad seemed likely to happen to Watney's life resulting in the climax of the movie to be unexciting and quite predictable. Also it took away from the empathy one should feel for the character. So if anything unexpected did happen one would not really care about Watney's fate.The Martian failed at trying to skillfully blend comedy with an exciting survival story. Also the movie lacked excitement. There really were no memorable scenes given the film's location and dangerous landscape. The film solely relied on how Watney was going to survive, how he was going to contact earth, and how earth would respond to his situation. Honestly all these events portrayed looked exciting in the trailer but just ended up being tedious and uneventful.Now what exactly did The Martian do right? One of the positives of the movie was its intellect. The intellect behind the writing was arguably one of the best parts of this film which helped redeem it a bit. Also, as expected, the film featured some pretty good special effects. It mimicked the realism of space in a very accurate and practical manner. Unfortunately for The Martian, its special effects were overshadowed by the wondering spectacle of Gravity and the sheer beauty of Interstellar. Lastly, given the talent within the cast, the film was destined for great performances, particularly those of Matt Damon, lead through Ridley Scott's masterful direction.In short, The Martian disappointed through its lack of excitement, intensity, memorable scenes, empathy for the character, and its failed attempt at trying to blend comedy with drama. I would only recommend to scientists, and space nerds who would actually be interested in seeing how someone would survive on a different planet. I would not buy this and it is definitely not a good 3D or IMAX experience. Still waiting for Ridley Scott to make that awesome movie we have not seen in over a decade! 6/10",5,23,46,4 November 2015
