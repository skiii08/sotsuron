The Expendables 2," Love A-Team or COD, You'll Love Expendables 2
","OK kids, if my ancient history is correct, there were only three things to watch on TV in the 80's and 90's. The Cosby Show, Seinfeld, and the A-Team. If you loved the A-Team, you've got to love Expendables 2. Mindless action and bullets, bullets, bullets delivered by all the old geezers from my upbringing. It was just like the A-team: defenseless town terrorized by evil doers. And because it's the big screen, the McGuffin they are after is plutonium. The only person missing was Kevin Segal. Expendables 2 is better than it's first movie, which I fell asleep on both times I tried to watch. No one person has enough lines to actually accuse them of acting. The one surprise is that Dolph Lundgren comes off as the intelligent person that he is in real life. (Masters in Chemical Engineering from The Massachusetts Institute of Technology and The Royal Institute of Technology.) There are no surprises. No deep thinking needed. Yes, there is the mandatory final hand to hand combat showdown between good guy and bad guy on, wait for it, an abandoned warehouse catwalk. If you can enjoy playing Call of Duty, you can enjoy watching Expendables 2.",7,2,5,16 September 2012
