The Blair Witch Project," A horrific film...for all the wrong reasons.
","I heard about all the hype; I got myself all excited; I eventually saw the film...and decided that it has to be the most pointless film of ALL time. For one, most of the actual film used by the creators seems to have been wasted on shots of the ground and the trees.  I ended up getting dizzy with the way the stupid girl was waving the camera around. The most annoying thing about 'The Blair Witch Project' was that it wasn't particularly scary.  In fact, it wasn't remotely scary in any way.  Nothing made me feel uneasy and the audience in the cinema with me began to tut and look at their watches half-way into the film. Also - not many people know this - a similar, but far superior film called 'The Last Broadcast' was made a year earlier than the BWP.  I get the feeling that the BWP is a cheap and nasty version of this classic. Don't bother with this purile pile of pants; go out and rent 'Casper' because it is much more scary and far more interesting. A big YAWN.",Null,0,1,2 November 2000
