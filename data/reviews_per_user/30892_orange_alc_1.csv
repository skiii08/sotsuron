Marie Antoinette," accuracy?
","I think this film is quite accurate.They tried to make us understand how people felt at this period, by playing modern music etc... I have seen the movie in English with subs yesterday at the movie theater, and some history university professors were there to comment and debate about the film after we have seen it. And yes it is quite accurate. It was impossible for a Dauphin and a Dauphine in France not accept the throne of France, nor was it possible to abdicate. Louis and Marie Antoinette, had to go through it, even though they felt they were not prepared for it. Maybe they were to modern for their times... As it always happens, when you ahead of your times, you get in trouble sooner or later. Look at JC, he was ahead of his time... Think of Galileo... The queen yes actually read Rousseau as many nobles did. The debt was not higher than under Louis the XIV or Louis the XV, but they were nice KIngs compared to the previous ones especially, more modern, quite young and not too strong, so the bourgeois and some nobles used the people to just sweep other nobles and the monarchy, in order to get the power. It is always like this, if you are a little different, and you are a little nice, people always try, they will think they can do what they want with you. Human nature has not changed... Anyway in France we have replaced monarchy, by an elective monarchy... Is the situation Right now much better, for our times at least. It was a bourgeois revolution, not the peoples' revolution. Well I really loved the movie, it is so fresh it makes me think of the Milos Forman version of the dangerous liaisons, 'Valmont' outstanding!!",Null,6,13,31 May 2006
