Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The magic is still there...jaded and closed eyes just don't see it
","First of all, there seem to be two camps of people who don't like 'The Phantom Menace':  a group of 'professional' critics and 'fans' who complain that the film is nothing like the original trilogy and is simplistic, inane, and childish.  As for the critics, a great many of them are arrogant, iconoclastic pseudo-intellectuals who would have loved nothing more than to see this film fail.  They're of the same breed as the critics who panned the original trilogy.  It should have said something to all of the public that these guys broke their word and released reviews before they were supposed to.  Clearly, they simply hoped to hurt the film's opening as much as they could and were willing to be dishonest and unethical to do so.  But these people never understood what Star Wars is all about, never tuned in to its true magic.What is amazing--and unfortunate--is that their responses seemed to actually work on some people.  There's no doubt in my mind that all the 'the character development isn't there' and 'Mr. Lucas hasn't delivered the goods', etc. etc. sent a lot of people into the wrong mode, a pessimistic outlook that set them up to miss the strengths of the film.  Then of course there was all the 'hype,' the kind that no film--not the most complex dramatic film by the most revered director--could have lived up to.People who've praised the movie have hit on most of its good points, so I'm just going to respond to some of the negative comments that have been made. First, yes, there is a 'Disney'-esque feel to the movie, but that was definitely true of the original trilogy, and anyone who doesn't acknowledge that is not being honest.  But what's wrong with Disney-esque??  Disney's produced some very good movies that appeal to both children and adults, and that is precisely the intent of this film, as it was with Eps. 4, 5, & 6. Yes, sometimes the movie gets a little too cutesy, but it's really not as overbearing and overwhelming as some people claim (again, I think they're just being over-sensitive because of all the negative pre-release buzz). Plus, some of the humor really *is* funny, if you watch it as a kid would watch it, which was also exactly the same type of humor found in the original trilogy.Secondly, people who think the plot is confusing just aren't paying attention.  It was quite easy to follow.  Then there are people who say it was a sort of 'connect the dots' plot and had no focus (in essence, a poorly constructed plot), but I think that again those people are missing out on the real plot unfolding in the story.  First, the movie begins in medias res, with no clear 'villain' (the Trade Federation is no Empire)--just a couple Jedi who think they're on a routine keep-the-peace mission.  Why did anyone expect the movie to begin with some grandscale conflict the likes of which we saw in A New Hope??  This is Episode I, for goodness sake---chapter 1 of the story, and the true conflict that will push the story forward has not fully developed yet.  If anyone was paying close attention to this story, they would realize that it is the story of Palpatine's subtle--and not so subtle--moves to assume leadership of the Republic...the seeds of the Empire are being sewn.  Behind the whole Trade Federation dispute, the Senate conflicts, and even the Jedi Council ponderings over Anakin and the appearance of the Sith lords, Palpatine is orchestrating his way to power. Realizing this, the viewer should recognize the very somber and dark nature of the ending of the film...the 'victory celebration' is shallow because, in truth, the Dark Side has won...Anyway, to put it as succinctly as I can, a lot of people have simply missed the complexity (and yes, even the darkness) of this movie, for whatever reason.  Maybe they're too jaded, maybe they went in with the wrong attitude (tainted by foolish comments by self-important critics), or maybe they've simply lost the ability to be dazzled, but they missed it...and I feel sorry for them, because their shortsightedness has kept them from enjoying a worthy and wonderful entry into the Star Wars saga.",10,0,0,26 May 1999
