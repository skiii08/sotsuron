Walk the Line," Just freakin' awful
","I am dumbfounded as to how this movie got so many rave reviews from people on this board; I can only suppose it has been swamped by studio supporters, since I see only toward the last pages are the real opinions coming out.This is about the worst biopic I've ever seen. Phoenix wasn't that bad, but he reminded me of Johnny Cash not at all. Not his looks, not his voice, not his mannerisms, just nothing. I can't say too much about Witherspoon, as I never saw June to make a comparison.So, the live performances, to which we were treated aplenty, were largely meaningless and, I'm sorry to say, there wasn't much in between them to take our minds off this fact. The story, such as it was, was full of threads that never went anywhere and it otherwise left us alternately either hanging or belaboured by the obvious. The editor must have been on the same pills Johnny was taking, because it made me feel nervous and irritable.This gives me cause to question the value of IMDb reviews as a whole, since I couldn't have previously imagined so many people being so totally wrong. I have many times relied on IMDb to get some idea about a film before I went to the trouble to actually see it. I prefer to believe my theory of the board being flooded by friends of the studio. In this case, I saw the movie first, before the reviews, else I would be in a proper state right now, out for blood.If I have to have an opinion, I would say this film is an insult to Johnny Cash and all his fans. That's all there is to it. If you haven't seen it yet, then take my advice and don't bother. 2 out of 10.freddyzdead at gmail dot com",2,6,13,25 June 2006
Detroit," Not very well balanced
","I was living in Detroit, on the west side during this time. I can tell you, it was scary. I expected this movie to show me some things I may have missed, but it didn't. The rioting itself was just background to the goings on at the Algiers Motel, which mainly the whole movie is about.I will give them credit for almost seamlessly integrating real footage with that shot just for the purpose. There are some factual errors and some anachronisms, but mostly they wouldn't be noticed except by someone my age.
I have to admit to being somewhat disappointed by the amount of attention given to the events at the motel, not to say this wasn't important, and the acquittal of the police involved had very dangerous consequences.
 
But I still would have liked more coverage of the riots themselves, being as it was the worst racially fueled conflict in the country up to that time. So, although I appreciate the effort that went into the making of this, it could have been much better.",4,2,6,19 December 2017
Unbreakable," Unwatchable
","The interesting thing is that I watched this without knowing it was by M. Night, and the same goes for The Sixth Sense. I never could put my finger on just what bothered me about the latter, but now I know. Both of these have a lot in common with The Village, which I thought should be marvelous, but after it finished, I felt cheated.I like Bruce and Sam can do no wrong in my book, but neither of them could save this. The whole production seemed to be deliberately aimed at irritating the viewers. Accordingly, I am just dumbfounded by the huge number of rave reviews here. Why can't these people detect a bad film when they see one? Not to say it couldn't have been good. The idea was original, just really badly executed, IMO. Just as The Village could have been good. Really, Sixth Sense wasn't that bad, so maybe M. Shyamalan should have stopped after that one and just been a one-hit-wonder. Maybe he should go back to Bollywood; they're desperately in need of good ideas. How they can just keep stamping out the exact same kind of movie over and over is just beyond me.Anyway, if you haven't seen Unbreakable yet, take my advice and don't bother. I wish I could unsee it.",2,1,4,11 November 2006
Armageddon," You gotta be kidding
","This could have been good, if they hadn't tried to make it so Star Wars-ish. Such a disastrous scenario is indeed possible, and an emergency mission to blow up the meteor might be one way to fix it.But not like this. The Shuttle is given capabilities that are impossible. In fact, the whole mission is so full of bad science that it makes Spielberg look like Einstein. The only part that's believable is when Ben Affleck singlehandedly blows up the Russian space station. I believe he could really do that.There is far too much attempted humour; this is supposed to be the ultimate disaster movie, after all. Why did they think it needed to be funny as well? And then there is the usual Amero-centric viewpoint. Half of Asia gets blasted away. Wow, that was lucky, it could have been us.Did I mention clichés and stereotypes? This film is just about nothing but.Very expensive popcorn. If you haven't seen it yet, don't bother unless you know nothing at all about science.",2,1,3,15 April 2007
Schindler's List," The Truth
","I have no trouble agreeing that this is Spielberg's best film. That's not as much of a compliment as you might think, because the majority of them have been embarrassingly awful.Stevie learned a long time ago that there is big money in mawkish sentimentality and set out to capitalize on it. There is a substantial, guaranteed segment of the cinema-going public that will accept schmaltz as art. They simply do not know the difference.So, while I will accept that this is a good movie, there is no way it belongs in the top 250. Or even in the top 2500. There are too many historical inaccuracies, too many factual liberties, too many scenes overdone for deliberate shock value. The whole thing is fake. It is only vaguely based on what actually happened. Yet it is presented as a factual historical drama and has been widely accepted as such.The excesses of Hitler's Germany can never be forgotten or swept under the rug, but embellishing them and making gaudy parodies of the real thing does not well serve the memory of those who suffered through it.'The Pianist' was not a perfect film, either, but it is a lot better than this one.",4,11,27,8 September 2007
Transformers," Much less than meets the eye
","I don't think this really needs yet another review, but I feel duty-bound to do my bit to offset the totally undeserved 10-stars given by so many persons apparently with no taste, or else involved with the production.This is unquestionably the worst Michael Bay 'film' I have ever seen. It makes some of Uwe Boll's stuff look Oscar-worthy. Perhaps it is the combination of Bay and Spielberg which resulted in something much worse than either could have managed alone. Mr. Spielberg, the king of schmaltz, has his stamp all over this one.I guess the bad taste came from Mr. Bay's side of the family. I found the 'Bros before Hoes' line to be downright offensive. And robots peeing on people. What is this, Scary Movie 5 or something? Absent plot, lame dialog, vomit-inducing camera-work, rotten acting, this movie has it all, no need to seek out a Uwe Boll film.On the plus side, Megan Fox is pretty easy to look at. Too bad she can't act.Oh, and the CGI isn't too bad. Must be where all the money went.",1,10,18,13 November 2007
From Dusk Till Dawn," You gotta be kidding
","If I were allowed to split this up, I'd give a '10' to the first half and a '1' to the second, only because Salma Hayak was in it. Other than that, it's a mindless, ludicrous, gratuitous, gore-fest, with unnecessary religious overtones.It started off so well, and could have rivaled 'Pulp Fiction' in all departments if they had so chosen.Mr. Tarantino is ill-advised to 'act' in any of his films; he came very close to ruining Pulp Fiction with his unbelievably crass 'dead n*gger storage' routine. Fortunately, he wasn't quite so bad here, but they certainly should have cast somebody else. Anybody else.I would even go so far as to say the second half was as bad as Kill Bill II. Yes, that bad.George Clooney is flawless in this. He steals every scene he's in. Harvey Keitel demonstrates why he is one of my favourite actors. Juliette Lewis does herself proud, and makes me wonder why we haven't seen a lot more of her.If you liked Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs and you haven't seen this one yet, I would recommend that you watch it attentively up until they arrive at the Titty Twister, then turn it off and invent your own scenario as to how it might've ended. Trust me, you'll be a lot better off.",5,0,1,10 October 2007
World Trade Center," Wasted the name
","Before watching this film, I decided to read the IMDb reviews. All of them. Took awhile, but now I no longer need to see the film at all.Remember 'The Net'? A film with that title should have been the definitive movie about the Internet. It wasn't. It was a giant turkey. Probably not a good career move for Sandra Bullock. Just terrible.You know what's coming: A film titled 'World Trade Center' should be a sensitive, impartial and courageous portrayal of the horrid events of that day. What did we get? A formulaic disaster/rescue script with Hallmark dialog, cheesy acting and (yawn) total predictability. While I wouldn't really expect such maudlin drivel from Stone, I'm not really surprised. There is a big swatch of population all set to open their wallets for such opportunistic sentimentality. Mr. Stone couldn't resist. Maybe he even had orders.So, a missed opportunity. Somebody else is going to have to make the *real* WTC film, but they'll have to call it some other name, else it will get confused with this uninspiring piece of dung. Personally, I think they should leave it alone; I can't think of who we have that might make said film without resorting to said maudlin plot devices. Might be best to just leave it be. But if you haven't seen this garbage yet, then don't bother. If you must, then first inquire as to whether any profits from it went to families bereaved by the disaster.",1,3,10,30 August 2006
The Great Raid," Even worse than Pearl Harbor
","Although this is guaranteed an audience by the fairly large number of people who will watch ANY war movie, this one will disappoint anybody looking for a good cinema experience.While it can't really be faulted too much on a technical basis, the characters are all one-dimensional and there is too much gung-ho John Wayne god-and-country stuff to capture anybody who isn't a war buff. It might even be a pro-war propaganda blurb, in which case it doesn't deserve even two stars.Like Pearl Harbor, the maudlin romantic sub-plots and gooey sentimentality go a long way toward wrecking what might have bordered on an enjoyable experience, even if one could overlook the wooden performances. Of course, these are the very things responsible for all the 9s and 10s this film has received here. The producers of this kind of film are well aware of this and are not above this sort of manipulation.I can't really bother to enumerate all the things wrong with this film; all I can say for sure is that I had big trouble sitting through the whole thing, which usually isn't a good sign. In my book, a good film is one that keeps me thinking about it for days after seeing it, and compels me to watch it at least once or twice more. This isn't one of them.",2,2,11,30 September 2006
Live Free or Die Hard," Puhleez
","This doesn't really need another comment, but I have to do my bit to balance all those 9 and 10 ratings on the first couple of pages.This film is cast-iron proof that Gollywood really thinks that if you throw enough guns and explosions at the screen, you can forget about putting any other sort of content in it.This is not in any way a 'Die Hard' story, I believe the main character was changed to John McClane, because they had to make another Die Hard before Bruce gets too old.I suspect there might be a secret 'Cliché Action Movie for Dummies' book out there somewhere. And it was followed to the letter to make this turkey. Especially the chapters on 'Enemy of the State' and 'Independence Day'.Bad science, ludicrous computers, plot holes that could swallow suns, stereotypes galore. Movies don't get any more formulaic than this one. And it's obvious they know this; why else would it be released to DVD so soon? So they can cash in before everybody wakes up.So, if you have the opportunity to not see this, I strongly advise that you take it. Especially don't fork over any money for this drivel, they might get the impression you liked it and want them to make more.Sadly, there are lots of movie-going automata who robotically line up to watch steamers like this, because other automata have told them it's really good.Shame on you, Bruce, you could have held out for something that did justice to the original.",1,7,14,24 October 2007
The Ringer," shamefully awful
","First of all, I do not want to take anything away from handicapped people; they have my full support. This piece of garbage movie doesn't. It's not even funny, as was the South Park episode the plot was ripped from. It is shallow, cliché, predictable and full of tiresome performances. I'm just amazed that so many reviewers here raved about it.There are so many ways this topic could have been given the treatment it deserves, but the makers obviously took the 'safe' way out: make a bowl of mush that would attract enough non-thinking, cliché-loving fans to make it a hit at the box office. After that, who cares? How bad is it? Well, I sat down and got through half of it before I was seething so much I had to turn it off. I wasn't going to bother with the rest, but in fairness I couldn't write this without having seen the whole thing, so I forced myself to sit through the rest. Wouldn't have made any difference.All in all, I think this movie is an affront to 'mentally challenged' people, and history and hindsight will serve to ultimately embarrass the people behind this turkey. It's sad to see that even those who should know better were taken in by it, e.g. the first reviewer.I'm not going to spoil anything by giving away any plot details, but I will say to anybody who hasn't seen this piece of trash yet: don't waste your time and money.",1,5,14,10 May 2006
