Ford v Ferrari," Determination, money, and stubbornness is all it takes to build a winning race car. But to drive it probably, you need to feel the car and make adjustments and have balls of s
","The GOOD: The cast is phenomenal. Matt Damon is perfect as a chicken farmer from Texas. Christian Bale plays a short tempered British person almost to perfectly. Josh Lucas portal of a ford executive with a determination to ruin the GT is just frustrating enough to be convicting. Jon Bernthal finally gets to play a likeable character who has a job to do at first, then just becomes part of the solution.The writting is also beautiful in more ways than one. You need to pay attention to the little things, as they tend to come back up later on. Its also poetic in nature, from one scene to another. Thing's that are said, and things that happen have a deeper meaning and you have to be ready with a box of tissues. This shouldn't be considered a spoiler: when Henry Ford II is talking to Shelby about going to war should go down as one of the greatest moments in film history. That conversation represents both characters and the true life story of Ford Vs. Ferrari perfictly!Not to mention the love story between Ken and his wife feels real. No relationship is perfect; she doesn't want him to quit and shes not going to stand back and watch him throw his life away. The other side of that situation, he wants to be a race car driver, but he needs to put food on the table. I can reallynfeel the love between these characters, and I feel for them.Set design, props, and costumes were so on point for each character, location and clothing that when the movie was over I felt like a time traveler. This film just did such a great job of pulling you into its world. Not to mention the cars!!! I love how Shelby drove a AC Cobra throughout the movie and Ken trashed the Mustang. Again, this movie does a great job of just keeping you drawn to the plot so well.The BAD: I felt like it ran long in some places. Especially towards the end. This movie could of, and should of ended after the race. You already ended the movie with captions, why not add a few more. On the topic of the captions; they're to fast. Im not a spead reader, leave them on the acreen fornat least 5 seconds.
This is fsr and away my favorite movie of 2019! I was hooked from beginning to end. I would even love to see another racing movie based on Lancia's really history.",10,2,3,12 January 2020
Knives Out," A beloved father celebrates his 82nd birthday with his family. But he has other matters to take care of which leads to treachery, confusion and a murder.
","For a more detailed review please keep reading.The GOOD: The cast is phenomenal! The list of 'A-list' and 'up and coming' actor's, and actresses are truly something special, but the way they interact with each other just makes this movie feel even more special. Usually when a group of actors with this much talent comes together they struggle for the spot light. I just feel like everyone had an good sense of who their character is.The story was also very unpredictable, and it kept me guessing from beginning to end. It started out with me pointing finger's, then I thought I knew who the killer was. Finally the end came, and lets just say I was over thinking the whole time. The writing for Benoit Blanc is genius and the way Daniel portrayed this character is genius. All of his little mannerisms, and subtle gestures are just perfect for this character.The set design deserves some praise. The chair with all the knives is incredible, but so is the rest of the house! It feels like an Agatha Christie novel from start to finish, and at the same time I don't think it's trying to hard.
The BAD: The costume design feels lazy. I feel like none of the characters are showing how wealthy they are. The only person who looks kinda outlandish and matches her character is Jame Lee Curtis. Also who in their right mind would buy an old BMW, then use that as their everyday car?Do the detectives not carry handcuffs or a gun? No spoilers, but even when they get introduced, you don't see a badge, or any credentials. The writing for the detectives are almost none existent. They serve no purpose to the story, which is a shame because they're played by two very good actors.
Overview: This was in my opinion one of the best none super hero related movies of the year! Which is funny because it has at least two superhero's in it. I look forward to more projects from Rian Johnson.",5,1,2,8 January 2020
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Join Frodo and the fellowship of the ring as they traverse through middle earth in their quest to destroy the one ring.
","The GOOD: The cinematography, set designed, costumes, lighting, and acting are just phenomenal in almost every way. To the way they transitions between scenes; to the way they introduce each character it is just phenomenal. The use of color and light only added to how amazing this movie really is. As they trekked through middle earth, I felt a real sense of warmth, and cold because of each scene attention to details. Not to mention the peril the fellowship faced.I need to mention the costume and set design, because its just breathtaking. Each character has their own style and colors which helps represent each of their emotions and personality. Even the background orc's have a scene of individuality. They're just an army, all made from the same mud pit, they could all look the same. But instead more time was taken to make sure they didn't. This is just so amazing! Not to mention you really felt like you could walk though each and every set scene for scene. From Bilbos house, to Rivendell, all the way to Orthanc; I just like how you could really step into this world. The attention to detail in Bilbos house alone is enough to make me want to be a hobbit.The BAD: You're trying to shove a very detailed book into a movie so some things are going to miss the mark in my opinion. I felt as if the introduction of each character was rushed, and as this is my first time meeting them I would like to know more about them from the start. Not to mention the story its self felt as if it progressed very rapidly. It still took 2 1/2 hours, but nothing got resolved. That being said I love the progression the writing took in some areas as well. But a lot of the character development was over looked and I'm not sure why. Why is Bill, the horse, so important to Sam? What is the relationship between Gandalf and Frodo, or Gandalf and Saruman? What makes Elvis more powerful the dwarfs? What is the relationship between Aragorn and Legolas, or Aragorn and Arwen? How can Aragorn speak elvish? These are just some of the questions I had that I would of liked answer to with out having to read the book or wait for a sequel.Now all that being said, this was a great movie! I am well aware there're more movies to come and also a prequel series to follow this. Not to mention the books.",5,0,5,8 January 2020
