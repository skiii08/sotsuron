3:10 to Yuma," do we actually pay people to write such stupid endings??
","The movie is OK until we get to the final 20 minutes or so. In the last 20 minutes, it is just TOTAL, ABSOLUTE nonsense. Let me give you a few examples: 1) Christian Bale, an average ranger, able to cross the town and kill 20-30 men while not being touched by a single bullet 2) Russel Crowe, who is supposed to be a cold-hearted, natural born killer with no feelings, cooperating with Bale and giving himself to justice because he felt sympathetic for the poor guy 3) Crowe killing his entire team who rescued him because they killed the man who imprisoned him 4) Crowe giving himself to justice by boarding the train voluntarily so that he can be sentenced and executedGreat actors (Bale, Crowe) but the scenario is just nonsense. I have hardly seen such a stupid movie in my life...",1,11,19,23 June 2011
The Departed," Pathetic remake of a masterpiece
","The names that appear on the movie are just impressive: a great director (Martin Scorsese - I am a BIG fan of Goodfellas, taxi driver, Raging Bull just to name a few of his movies) and great actors (Di Caprio, Nicholson, Sheen, Daemon, Wahlberg), but the entire movie and the way how it was directed is just a total disappointment from beginning to end. Nicholson being overly cruel, Wahlberg being overly cynical and aggressive towards everyone (and why??), Di Caprio spending his time in the movie crying like a girl, Sheen inexistent... Also how can one believe that a stranger can earn a head of crime syndicate's trust in just 6 months, especially when that head of crime syndicate has the reputation of being very suspicious and doesn't trust people easily?? It looks to me that Scorsese was too ambitious, tried to do too much in a movie, and at the end, he just didn't deliver. I felt no sympathy or anger whatsoever for any single character in the movie. I am a BIG fan of Hollywood movies and Scorsese but for once, I prefer by far the original Hong Kong version, Infernal Affairs which is far better directed, more dramatic, where the psychology of the characters is far better developed (I actually felt sympathy for the undercover cop), and the story far more credible (it took the undercover cop several years to earn the crime lord's trust in the Hong Kong movie as opposed to a few months in The Departed). I now have the proof that even super talented directors and actors (whom you believe have nothing to prove anymore) with a huge budget are able to deliver a garbage...",1,5,7,24 June 2011
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," It is just a remake of Episode IV (A New Hope)
","I am a massive Star Wars fan. I loved the 1st trilogy, I did not like the prequels. As a standalone movie, this movie is a good movie: good actors, great effects (and it is good to see they did not use only CGI like in the terrible prequels), the actions scenes very very well filmed, and last but not least, it was awesome to see the old cast (Solo, Chewie, R2-D2, C-3PO...). However, this felt like a pure and simple remake of Episode IV (A New Hope). There is a big sentiment of 'deja vu', and a big lack of creativity. Some examples: 1) In Episode IV, the plot starts in Tatooine, a desert/sand dune planet. In The Force Awakens, the plot starts in Jakku, also a desert/sand dune planet. 2) In Episode IV, Princess Leia leaves a message in a droid (R2-D2) for Obi-Wan and the Empire will try to find that droid. In The Force Awakens, Po Dameron leaves a message in a droid (BB-8) for the Resistance and the First Order will try to find that droid. 3) In Episode IV, the Empire has a Death Star that destroys planets. In The Force Awakens, the First Order has a Starkiller Base that also destroys planets. 4) In Episode IV, the Rebels meet up to make a plan to destroy the Death Star and you see a large map of the Death Star and its one weakness (destroy that specific one reactor). In The Force Awakens, the Resistance meet up to make a plan to destroy the Starkiller Base and you see a large map of the Starkiller Base and its one weakness (shoot in that one specific spot) 5) In Episode IV, there is someone in the background that pulls strings (the Emperor), you don't know much about him yet except that Darth Vader works for him and is his apprentice. In The Force Awakens, there is someone in the background that pulls strings (supreme leader Snoke), you don't know much about him yet except that Kylo Ren works for him and is his apprentice.And the list goes on...To summarise: overall, an entertaining movie, lots of action, good development of the main 2 young characters (Rey and Finn), awesome to see the old cast. But if you have already seen and liked the 1st trilogy, you will see that this new movie lacks of creativity and is just a remake of the first Star Wars, re-adapted for the new generation.",2,13,20,20 December 2015
