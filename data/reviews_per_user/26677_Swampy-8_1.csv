The Blair Witch Project," It'll be more effective on video
","This is like a filmed version of a told-around-the-campfire story, which will make it more effective in a small group in a darkened living room than in a large group in a darkened theatre. The acting (improvisational dialogue) was the best feature -- sometimes gripping, sometimes witty, but always real. No great revelations here, except for some insight into why obsessed documentarians have to keep shooting film of tornadoes or armed guerillas instead of getting out of their way.",Null,1,1,13 August 1999
