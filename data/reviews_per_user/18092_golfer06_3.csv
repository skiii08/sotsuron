Come and See," Pure Realism
","'Come and See' directed by Elem Klimov documents Nazi Germany's assault on Russia during World War II. The story centers around a young boy named Florya who has a dream-like idea about being a soldier and fighting for Russia, but his ideas of war are shattered when he gets a taste of the utter truths of what the war can entail. After seeing his family dead, he is utterly distraught and knows he cannot contain this child mentality of war anymore. We can see Florya age dramatically through the course of film, even though he is still the same boy from the beginning of the film. The experience has truly caused him to age and change and for the audience to get a new look at him at the movie's end. 'Come and See' is truly an assault on our five senses, capturing the realistic feel in all aspects. Klimov does a fine job capturing the essence of the brutality of the war with little violence. Movies like 'Saving Private Ryan' documents more violence, blood, and SGI then actually capturing the true emotion and hardship. 'Come and See' really focuses on emotion and the horrors of war. The scene which really is special is when Florya finally fires his gun to have a sort of epiphany and realization. Going backwards in the scene really makes it more captivating. Any of these events could be stopped if Hitler did not exist or was killed before he could let the horrendous events of the Hollacaust unfold. I really recommend this movie to truly reveal what the war is really about and how psychologically damaging it could be.",8,5,6,15 December 2007
Warrior," Truly Inspiring
","Wow! That was the first word that I said after finishing this movie. Director Gavin O'Connor did a great job with these group of actors and allowing the audience to get absorbed in the story. I'm not a MMA fan, but I loved this movie. This movie was more than a MMA movie. It was a movie about hardships, determination, pain, and triumph.'Warrior' deals with the story of two brothers who don't really know each other. An alcoholic father, Paddy Conlon (Nick Nolte) who doesn't know his sons anymore due to his alcoholism. Two brothers with totally different lives that both need a fighting competition to get their lives back on track. I thought younger brother Tommy (Tom Hardy) performance was really great. I can't wait to see Tom Hardy in the 'The Dark Knight Rises.' He was believable, real, and a very powerful character. The older brother Brendan (Joel Edgerton) also had an amazing performance. I was pulling for him the entire movie. And Nick Nolte was the perfect person for his role as an recovering alcoholic. And the remaining supporting cast also made for a real authentic experience.This movie was probably the best fighting movie I've seen in a really long time, if not ever. It was great because it was authentic and genuine. It was emotional and heart felt. It had everything a good fighting movie needed. It was a great culmination of directing, acting, film making, and music. I highly recommend it. You will want to get in the cage yourself after watching it.",9,0,3,28 February 2012
Ran," A Work of Art
","'Ran' directed by Akira Kurosawa is truly a masterpiece in film. The essence of camera movement and capturing nature makes it one of a kind. Adapted from William Shakespeare, King Lear, the story centers around three sons, whose father decides to hand down his power and kingdom to one of his sons. After this moment, the sons are truly separated from each other by their need for hubris. Kurosawa does a excellent job with the long shot and capturing the beauty of the scene and the moment. Nature, is also another character in the film, that Kurosawa captures beautifully. At times of chaos it seems that nature responds to reveal a religious entity. By having instances of meaningful emptiness, it allows the audience to have a moments of reflection, which many other films do not offer. Also the pristine use of color in the movie really makes it a wonderful piece of art. Each brother in the movie contains their own color and when these colors clash, it reveals the essence of art. For instance, when the red and yellow sides clash, they cause an orange fire that is set in the castle, to reveal what happens when two sides merge. It may cause destruction and utter chaos. Also the music in the film really makes the film more captivating and worth watching. I highly recommend this film for its use of color, nature, and incredible camera movement.",9,2,4,15 December 2007
