Blade Runner 2049," Blade Runner 2049 is the best sequel to date
",I'm sorry you marvel fanboys didn't get your 15 action scenes but this is an actual movie that has actual depth. Ryan Gosling absolutely murdered the role officer K. There are scenes of just complete silence where you just sit there watching Gosling act. He does not have to say anything to get across how he feels. The cimetography is amazing. The soundtrack absolutely slaps. Just slow down your busy life and watch a movie that takes over your emotions and makes you think.Please don't watch this movie on a low end projector or tv. Watch this movie in 4k preferably on an oled to get the full effect of the movie.,10,4,20,17 February 2020
