The Blair Witch Project," You either love it or you hate it: I loved it.
","If you have read the other user comments for this film, you have noticed that people either love it, or they hate it.  There is a reason for this. There are two types of horror movies: There is the kind that tries to scare you by showing you something scary, and there is the kind which suggests something scary, but lets you imagine it yourself.  The people that hated Blair Witch were wanting scary images and blood and guts to be fed to them. That is not what they got.Blair Witch sets out to scare you by forcing you to imagine something.  It lets your mind 'personalize' what is really scaring you.  The people that don't like this movie must not understand this.  Either that, or they just don't care and they can't appreciate a horror movie which strays away from tradition.  Either way, they did not fully take in what this movie was offering to them.If you are debating whether to watch/rent/buy this movie, you must first think about what really scares you.  Are you frightened by a scary monster jumping out and eating someone?  Or are you scared when you wake up in the middle of the night and hear something outside your window, letting your imagination create the most horrifying possibilities of what it is?  That is what The Blair Witch Project tries to do, and in my opinion, it succeeds entirely.",9,1,2,14 October 2000
Fight Club," Simply a masterpiece!
","You might hear people saying that this film is 'absurd', or 'pointless'.  The people who say those things did not see far enough into this movie.  Trust me on this, if you can take the mental energy to think about a movie, you will LOVE Fight Club. There is not much to enjoy about this movie if you are looking for a simple plot scattered with action and violence.  Fight Club requires thought.  And if you can do that, you are in for a great treat.It is sad that so many people will go into this movie looking for mindless violence, and then come out dissatisfied.  Then they will tell everyone not to see the movie because the story was dumb and it made no sense. I suppose those people are not the ones who were meant to appreciate Fight Club.Fight Club is a masterpiece and will be loved for years.  For anyone who has not yet seen this movie, listen to me: Watch this movie with an open mind, and you will experience great things.",10,0,1,26 August 2000
