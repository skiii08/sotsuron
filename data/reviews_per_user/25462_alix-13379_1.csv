Hereditary," The worst horror film I've ever seen
","I've had to create an IMDb account to share just how terrible this film was. I was initially excited to see this film due to the hype and I love a good horror movie that will make me want to sleep with lights on. But my word, spare yourself the two hours or leave 20 minutes before the end and imagine your own ending. The film started off like it was a slow burning horror movie that had the potential to be great, credit where credit is due.. the acting was good. The characters were not delved into at all which leads me to the first stage of confusion. To add insult to injury they killed off the main character and the cherry on top was the laughable ending. This slow burner went nowhere. Too many thin plot lines that left the cinema theatre confused and cracking jokes. The ending.... what was that?! I've seen scarier jobbies in my toilet. It was like the directors thought screw it let's just throw this in. Everyone was laughing. I'm gutted at the false advertising. Watch the trailer and that's all the decent bits all in a lovely 2 minutes. I missed probably the only day of summer in Scotland to see this diarrhoea. I wonder how much the reviewers that gave this over 2 stars were paid to hype this film up. Give it a miss and do anything else but watch this",1,2,5,30 June 2018
