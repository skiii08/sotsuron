Skyfall," From the Sky it fell indeed!
","What a shameless mess of a movie. I loved Casino Royal and was relieved that the Bondfranchise finally seemed to be getting it right again after the embarrassing Pierce Brosnan episode. Casino Royal was a good movie, it was dark, gritty - good acting, good solid action and the plot made sense. Quantum of Solace was not as good, but not bad. This one however is just painfully retarded. It revels in coincidental, stupendous and illogical twists and turns, there's just no sense to it. Just random pretentious bull. Bond should really have died in the first bit. And stayed dead. That would have saved the movie and been the honorable thing to do. Now they just made a disgrace of it all. I am deeply disappointed. Sam Mendes! What happened? American Beauty is one of my favorite movies of all time! How could you? I am sorry to say so, but shame on you! Daniel Craig? You revived 007, rising again like a Phoenix - back into the ashes it is. Talking about a fall from the sky. Javier Bardem - tu quoque? I have never seen Bardem act so badly. It was painful. Was this the same actor that made my blood turn cold in No Country for Old Men? This performance was not even worthy of being compared to the shadow of a fart of the character in that movie. NEVER will I watch a Bond movie again. It is beyond ruin and redemption now. SHAME ON YOU! The makers, that is, and the people who rate this up to over an 8. What is wrong with you people? Seriously.",1,72,132,4 December 2012
Terminator Salvation," Pointless, stupid, pathetic
","I actually saw this movies months ago and for some reason I'd been able to block it out of my mind, together with the anger that was unleashed by watching it. But apparently it wasn't buried very deep and an unfortunate link on a website brought the whole damn thing back to me. So now I'll try and deal with it here and then lay it to rest for once and for all (and then nuke it). This movie is a disgrace, it's a shameless attempt to squeeze some more money from a successful movie-franchise, without even taking the trouble to write a good (or at least decent) story. The whole thing is pointless, the inconsistencies are mind-boggling, 83% of the movie makes no sense at all. Luckily I forgot most of the stupidities but some one cannot forget: - the 'climax' at the Skynet HQ: so John and Kyle are Skynet's biggest targets and Skynet's tried everything to get them and kill them - they get them/ trapped in their HQ and then only have one or two robots that fail to kill them? pffff - why does Skynet uses Kyle as bait for John to begin with? As Kyle is John's father to be, killing Kyle will erase John instantaneously - first John is very concerned that Skynet will find out about his secret base and keeps low profile, but then at one point he decides to blow up the mines around the base to get Marcus - surely that might attract some attention?One of the most important points is that if you enter the possibility of time travel in story, you'll inevitably end up with the possibility of alternative realities and confusing, tricky story-telling issues and for sure, the former franchise installments were not rock-solid, but still they seemed to make sense and they made you care. And they kicked a#%. But this, this lifeless eyesore is a utter disgrace. Do not watch it, don't let the greedy, shameless makers earn a cent more for their unimaginative and lazy effort to make this 'movie'. Let us try and block it out of our common consciousness. Let's make it disappear. Forever and ever.",1,9,16,9 November 2009
Gran Torino," Did Eastwood's sense of quality take a holiday?
","Eastwood has shown us many times before he understands the art of movie-making. That's why it's so confusing to see he was able to make such an embarrassing, almost amateuristic movie. Yes, in the beginning of the movie some of the over the top grumpy, racist, cynical one-liners are quite amusing, but then it just turns into an embarrassing spectacle of bad acting, bad writing, bad editing, just bad movie-making. The acting of the girl, and especially the boy next door are just gutwrenching to watch. My head was spinning by such a display of amateurism. I try to understand how on earth they could have ended up in an Eastwood movie. Are they his adopted children or children of friends or something? For sure he's doing somebody a huge favor to include them in the movie. Some of the scenes are really beyond bad. What's up with him connecting with the Asian kids by fixing the washing machine in the basement? The whole idea of the scene is stupid and embarrassing, let alone the execution of it. And than the scene when they are waiting for the girl, not sure what happened to her. Eastwood stares at his hand saying (something like) 'at least in Korea we were expecting to loose one of us'.... Can it get more cheesy than that? I didn't know whether I should laugh or cry. And than the scenes with the barber. The initial idea works out well and amusing - the barber and Eastwood doing their grumpy routine. But than they try and milk the idea and even introduce the boy (deprived of all acting skills) into their 'domain of real men' to teach him the way of Men (to curse). It just gets so embarrassing, you just want to leave the theater and get drunk to simply destroy the brain cells that stored the whole thing, to save you from uncomfortable flashbacks for the rest of your life. Let's just hope mr. Eastwood had a blackout, let's just hope his sense of quality returns and let's hope the majority of IMDb-ers grow a sense of quality so 'movies' like this don't end up in the top 100 of all time again.",3,45,84,9 July 2009
The Dark Knight," I'll tell you why so serious
","I'm pretty serious about this one because I love movies. And since this movie is being rated as the best movie of all time, I was expecting something that could measure itself with the great movies of all time. I expected a movie that grips you, crawls under your skin and leaves you breathless. It does none of that. It is pretentious and inconsistent. It pretends to dig deep and dark and explore themes like morality, fate, good versus evil, heart versus mind, madness versus reason, and at the same time it wants to be this big spectacular action movie. But it fails miserably. It's all just a big clumsy pretentious inconsistent mess.Yes, Ledger is good, but for his performance to really contribute to the movie, there should have been context. If the rest just doesn't feel right, it looses its potential. If you throw a diamond on a mountain of poop, it doesn't change much of the way it looks or smells. Love interest Maggie Gyllenhaal (great performance in Stranger than Fiction) produces no chemistry at all, so I wasn't really blown away when she was blown up. Editing feels weird. But most of all it was the inconsistencies that got to me. And then not just the 'practical' ones (like the inconsistent protective quality of the batman suit; or why leave an extremely dangerous criminal unrestrained with a tubby policeman in his cell ('hostage volunteer? you, tubby?'); a schoolbus is used twice to make a grand escape? - do they come with teleporter machines these days?; why would you want to ride your batmobile face down?; Batman lowers his voice to be unrecognizable, but how hard is it to follow a batmobile with a helicopter to its hiding place?), but more importantly it's crucial plot/ morality inconsistencies. Yes, the White Knight went through some traumatic experiences, but to turn to the dark side so wholeheartedly and sadistically? And then to just let the Joker (at least indirectly responsible for his trauma) walk when he only needs to pull the trigger? Oh yeah, forgot, he's Mr. Coin Toss now. But even if he is guided by blind fate now, he still determines himself who he goes after and whether it's OK to threaten to blow out the brains of little kids. And then the Big Bad criminal who throws the detonator out off the window. Ah! The Joke is on you Joker! People are not what you make them out to be. Even the baddest bad ass has a good heart. Never mind that just before when the Joker threatened to blow up a hospital unless an innocent lawyer was killed, there was a crowd with guns ready to shoot the guy within no time. Also, what with the vote on the 'good people boat'? They vote to blow up the 'bad people' (democracy at its finest) but then Nobody has the balls to do it? So they don't blow up the other boat because they think it's unjust, but because they're spineless hypocrites.I applaud movies that try and deal with complex issues like conflicting emotions or morals, but to just make a big soup of it all under the pretense of 'but that's how life works, it's conflicting ideas, feelings and actions' is just a weak excuse for the inability or laziness to produce a good consistent story. Believe me, I detest black and white thinking and applaud the exploration of the Grey area. But that's not what this movie does. Piling a bunch of random inconsistent ideas on top of each other is not equal to exploring the Grey area.The climax is the ending though (it usually is). Our dark knight has to sacrifice himself, has to live like a hunted animal in the shadow, because the People would not be able to cope with the idea of Denth doing bad things, despite his recent traumas. So it's better to LIE to the public, because they are too stupid to make up their own mind and their faith in goodness of man would be lost forever (despite the fact that they just tried to establish with the boat-thing that there's goodness even in big bad criminals). So Batman (whose enemies take advantage of the fact that he doesn't kill) takes the blame for a bunch of random killings that could have been linked to anyone - a Joker perhaps? (even if they wanted to absolve Denth from his crimes -I mean, evidence/motive would have been needed to link it to Batman too?) and goes off running ('run Forrest!') into the night to save us another day. Because you just can't trust people to make up their own mind, it's better to lie to them. It's for their own good. Great morale. Straight from the White House? But ey, why so serious?",3,17,33,4 August 2008
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Watch out for permanent brain damage
","I had to stop watching this movie because my head started to ache so bad, I was afraid this shameless eyesore might cause me permanent brain damage. It is gut-wrenching awful. It's an insult. It's mind-boggling really, how some of the same people that created the first Transformers, that I liked, could actually 'create' something this pathetic. Where the first movie had a decent storyline, good character development, a good pace and great action, they didn't even bother to put any thought into this one. Just throw in some robots, hot chicks and why not, let's try and be funny with a big dose of mindless college humor. But really mindless: it really feels like they just made a list of the usual ingredients that do well in these college movies - some hot chicks, horny guys, embarrassing situations, drugs, nerds, some more hot chicks, and than just poured it in there, just at random, whatever. The target audience loves this stuff, so let's give it to them. Seriously, it's an insult. The characters are reduced to simpletons, sacrificed to the urge to make this a comedy. 'Once they start laughing, they will just swallow the action without asking themselves why or how' is what they must have thought. Well, I did not laugh, nor did I swallow any of the action, that is actually too fast, nauseating at times, to be enjoyed (if you would be able to shut off your brain in the first place). I got a very nasty headache from this shameless attempt to cash in on the success of the first movie. Don't waste any money, brain cells, time or energy on this. Let it rot for the garbage it is.",1,1,9,20 May 2010
Iron Man," Solid, maybe more
","Solid as iron, with a potential of something more. I vaguely remember reading some of the Iron Man comics. I was too young to really appreciate it, and at the same time, I don't think they gave him the same depth and humanity this movie does. Robert Downey is like a fish in the water playing Iron Man, suave and cynical. He's not too cynical though to provide a certain depth. Not that it is all about depth. It's mainly about just enjoying a good ride with awesome special effects and a crafty screen play with great dialogues and a rockin' soundtrack. And then you might look a bit further. Maybe the big antagonist of Iron man isn't just one man, Obadiah Stane / Iron Monger. Maybe he represents the good old Military Industrial Complex, the good old War Monger, the one that brought you Vietnam and Iraq. The one Eisenhower, JFK and others warned about. And maybe The Matrix is just a good action flick with nifty special effect. And maybe this is just a good movie.",8,1,2,7 May 2008
