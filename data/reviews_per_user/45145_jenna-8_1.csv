Requiem for a Dream," WOW!
","I saw this film at a friend's recommendation. 'Had no idea what I was getting myself into.  The only VHS copy that was available to me was the edited version.  Total mind-blower.  This film kept me awake for weeks!  I couldn't stop thinking or talking about it.  In fact, I became obsessed in my quest to find the Director's Cut.  Once I found the Director's cut, I couldn't wait to watch it!  There were just a few differences towards the end of the film, but it was pretty much the same as the edited version. Never have I been so obsessed about a movie that I had to watch it over and over.  I must admit, it's not an uplifter, yet a significant reminder of how my life is much better than I had ever thought it could be!The actors were so convincing as addicts.  Ellen Burstyn's performance was EXCELLENT!  As the widowed compulsive-eater-turned-diet-pill-addict, Burstyn was incredible and believable.  I had doubts whether or not Jennifer Connelly could pull off a role independent of her teeny-bopper days.  But OH MY GOSH!  I'm a fan of hers now.Great film!  Very well done!",10,0,1,22 December 2001
