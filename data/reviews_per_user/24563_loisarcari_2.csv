The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Somehow; it worked
","First; my experience of the movie while I was watching it; Lawrence acted well; if a little forced at times; the emotional acting rather than dialogue was generally well delivered. The scope and magnitude of the effects and cinematography was absolutely amazing; creating a very raw and believable world; and the other thing I adored was the action and empathy of this movie in stark contrast with one another; the action was very well done for a female led film; which, finally, with this franchise have decided not to skimp on that element. I agree not too much happened, but I was wrapped up the setting and the excellent portrayal of emotional fragility and mental illness to care; and while it may have been overlong in itself, I think each individual scene was as long as it needed to be. My only qualms are the overall pacing, at a push, the moments when Jennifer Lawrence did feel forced, and the under use of the brilliant supporting cast, and god did the romance underwhelm me. However; the depth of the visuals and emotional pull did win this over for me.",8,7,30,29 November 2014
Se7en," Lavishly disturbing
","Watched in film studies; loved the plot, liked the characters apart from the barely there wife. I mean, come on, they gave everyone else a personality... Morgan freeman was absolutely wonderful, and this film makes his current typecasting painful; with the depth and range of his performance. Brad Pitt did a good, but not remarkable job as well. The villain, John Doe, of course stole the show; and every single death was an exhibitionist delight to watch, gripping the part of you that likes to be disturbed by the throat, refusing to let go. The visuals were lavishly disturbing and the soundtrack worked wonderfully - however, the last death(s) was bloody obvious, and this was hell to watch for someone who thinks of herself as squeamish. I managed to man up and watch every death scene apart from the last one; in which the film turned into a radio programme instead and I was intensely fascinated with the minutiae of the floor.",9,2,4,29 November 2014
