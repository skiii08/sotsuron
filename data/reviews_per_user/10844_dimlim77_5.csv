Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," exactly what you'd expect from Borat
","I just came back from watching this movie and I thoroughly enjoyed it, The reason is simple, the movie delivered exactly what you expect to see on Da Ali G show. This was Borat at his best, doing what he does the best. He has the balls and guts to do things and say things that most of us would never even try. This movie made me laugh hard and it also grossed me out at certain times and that is what it is all about. How this comic genius was able to keep a straight face through all of this is beyond me.I read some of the negative reviews and these do not make sense to me. If you have never heard of this character named Borat then this movie probably did nothing for you. You really have to be used to what Sasha Cohen is all about when it comes to his character Borat. I mean, if you have never heard of him than avoid the movie. If you are looking for a smart comedy, then avoid. If you are concerned with political correctness, then definitely avoid. Sasha had to be escorted from the Rodeo because by the end of the performance they literally wanted to kill him. That did not appear in the movie but is true, check it out. lighten up and have fun with this.",9,2,9,4 November 2006
Resident Evil," One of the few good video game conversions
","The first thing to remember here is that this movie was a very popular video game and therefore the first thing that a viewer should look for is the similarity to that game. Personally, I do not understand anyone going to see this without at least some knowledge of the game. Having said all that, this movie was almost perfect in relating to the game.This movie had the same locations as the game, the exact same story and all the right characters that made the game so interesting. The action was good from the beginning to end and the only reason I did not vote the movie a 10 on 10 (based on rating previous VG movies) was that it suffered from the stereotypically not so perfect acting. Let's face it, it usually sucks in these types of movies. I know that this review might seem empty but the truth is that there is not much to say. The music fits perfectly, the casting was right for the movie (even if their acting was not perfect) and it stayed true to the original. My only advice is to stay away if you don't know about Resident Evil because that may cause you to have a lesser opinion of a movie that does exactly what it is supposed to.",8,0,0,27 March 2006
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Once again it does what it supposed to
","First off, the rating of 9 out of 10 is based on a video game movie rating and how it keeps true to the game itself. I have read both positive and negative reviews on this movie and I do not want to say right and wrong but the negative commenters are expecting too much.The action is even better than the first one, which I loved, the characters and the cast chosen to play them are even better and their chemistry really shows. No, they are not great actors but they are good enough to do the job. This movie mostly stays true to the game (actually I have never seen a movie that is 100% on with a book or a game) and any gamer should enjoy it.Basically Racoon City has come under attack by the T-Virus. This is an engineered virus that makes humans into the walking undead but there is a twist. There is a woman and a little girl, Alice and Angela, who were purposely injected with the virus. Alice worked for the Umbrella corporation and she was injected to be the super-human fighting machine and Angela was injected to help overcome some childhood illnesses. The movie is then basically an attempt to escape the city before the corporation launches a nuclear warhead. From there on the action is non-stop and exciting but there is some light comedic relief by Epps. To make this short, if you like video games and realize that this is a VG movie then you will like this movie. But if you are one of those people who have never heard of the game and go to theater, see this title and decide to give it a shot then you will probably not like it and be very confused.",9,0,1,27 March 2006
Saw II," don't believe the hype about the gore
","You know, after watching Saw 1, I was pleasantly surprised and then Saw II was coming out and I said to myself 'what a waste of time. probably a bunch of people dying terrible deaths for no reason' and I chose not to see it until it was released on the movie networks. Hence, I just finished watching it on TMN.I do not take well to gore; it bugs me most of the time and I was really hesitant about ever watching this. In the end though, this was a cake-walk. The gore (if you want to call it that) is very limited, uncreative and frankly, disappointing. There was nothing that made me shiver or feel disgusted like there should have been. The only thing that bugged me is when Jigsaw's successor fell in the needle stack but that is because I have a personal fear of needles. The story was decent, the acting was pathetic on the most part and no effort was made to make a good film. this really disappointed like The Hills Have Eyes. MORE GORE PLEASE!",7,0,0,28 October 2006
The Happening," What is wrong with you people?
","I always come to IMDb to read reviews by other users before seeing the actual movie. The Happening was one that I have wanted to see from the moment I had heard about it. So, when I heard and read the negative reviews from everybody, I was a little discouraged (especially since Lady in the Water was beyond terrible). But it turns out that you are all on crack.As you can see from my rating, I really enjoyed this film. It was a comeback in my opinion for Shamalamadingdong. I thought the script was funny, and Wahlberg's seemingly bad acting was his interpretation of this script and I thought he nailed it as did the rest of the cast. I do not think that the actors were here to win Ocars. It seems they came out to have fun with it and it worked. That is why it shocks me to hear such bad things. The tension was there. The comedy was there. The classic Shamalan ending was there.It just seems that the kind of people who went to see this movie are the ones who are probably pure horror and gore fans and were expecting more and more people to die in this film. Shamalan only had a few deaths shown in this film and then in other scenes he let us assume what was happening. Not everything has to be handed to us on a silver platter.If you are a true Shamalan fan, then see this movie. It is a film like Unbreakable and Signs where action is not happening all the time but it still keeps you gripping on for more.",8,3,8,24 June 2008
