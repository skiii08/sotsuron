United 93," Obviously made by a TV director
","Still another in a long line of 'noble' movies that people are afraid not to like. It used to be that all those awful old sword and sandal epics had to win awards. Now it's the docudramas that escape the TV screens for wide release. I suspected from the pulled-punches style that this just HAD to be made by a former TV director. Sure enough...check his credits! The action by the passengers is relatively bloodless, there is no shocking plane crash, and there is no aftermath of the carnage. You want to show horror? Show the horror, the massacre, don't try to be 'tasteful.' The names of the people who acted are known. Why not identify these heroes? The man who said 'Let's go' was known to be on the phone or we wouldn't know he said it. Tell us who this honored hero was rather than make everyone anonymous.Don't be afraid to admit this is lame.",3,6,14,30 August 2006
Bloody Sunday," Many people walked out
","What movie did the critics see? Are they afraid NOT to like something independent and 'noble'?When I got home after seeing this I tried to find critics who saw the same movie I did. Only two of them said: (1) The dialog is unintelligible and needs subtitles. (2) The entire film is shot with a jerky handheld camera and gave me a headache. (3) Why are there several black frames inserted between scenes?This is one of the few movies in my life I ever walked out on, as did many others in the university neighborhood showing the film.",Null,4,10,27 October 2002
World Trade Center," Big Disappointment
","I was expecting something very different. If you're going to tell this story, show the horror. First and foremost there should be the carnage, the horror, and the immediacy of it all. Instead of one man jumping to his death, show dozens raining down. Tell it!!! The air was PINK!!! All we see are a few reaction shots. We see minor injuries instead of a 'Gone with the Wind' devastation of acres of screaming men, one of the highest impact shots in movie history. If you're going to tell the story of World Trade or Rwanda, you don't pull punches just so kids can see it.There should also be dozens of heroes saying 'I'm going in!' as a hundred others rush forward behind them. There should more than one or two comments about getting 'them.' When Kennedy was killed we were instantly ready to quit college and jobs to fix bayonets and get 'them.' There is merit in intermittently bringing the story very personally down to two lives and families, but this is way too narrow and calm. Micro instead of macro. Both can be done alternately, personal then broadly. Way too much down time, at least 30 minutes of conversation between two trapped men.However, once again we're going to see 'king's new clothes' reviews, people afraid not to like something noble.In spite of it all I WAS in tears a number of times.",4,12,34,9 August 2006
War of the Worlds," Really good with one edit
","Not too far from the original novel, compares well with the '53 Geogre Pal version. Tripods are Wells, the shape of the spaceships are Pal. All it needs is one less overwrought character: Tim Robbins. When I taped it I edited out most of his part. He's just stuck in there like he's a friend of Spielberg in need of a buck. I also felt this way in Clint Eastwood's 'The Unforgiven': edit out Richard Harris and you have an intact, faster moving flick.There was publicity that Gene Barry from the '53 version has a no-line appearance at the very end as Grandpa. Alongside him was Ann Robinson, the female interest in '53.Little thing: Ann is the sister of Jay Robinson, the evil Roman emperor in 'The Robe.'",Null,0,0,18 January 2006
