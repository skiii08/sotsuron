Skyfall," Bond... what the f*ck happened?
","SPOILER WARNING!! Ready realized now that Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace was the best Bond films, especially the Casino Royale. In Skyfall Bond is almost in retirement. The movie even starts well but loses interest and becomes sluggish in half an hour, too much politics involved in the British secret services. The Bond into Bourne mode of Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace disappears ... Bond enters cure hangovers in poor shape mode. The Bond-Girl is only good for sex in the shower and to take the Bond villain's lair which is a desert island (nothing ever has been seen repeatedly in the Bond Sean Connery 60s) Adrenaline movie summarizes the initial chase and the capture of villain're equal to the Dark Knight's Christopher Nolan. This villain that although well played by Javier Bardem think it was needless to show your feminine side shall we say, a bit more even changed the decor of the house of Bond, or his wardrobe. A Bond villain has to want more than just a personal vendetta against the chief of the British secret service has to be really cold, calculating and capable of atrocities. In a good Bond movie he needs to be taken out of the comfort zone, his normal environment and be placed in another country or continent, to be put in extreme situations where he has to make tough decisions and use all his skills and training. Anyway I hope the next one is better.",6,3,10,3 November 2012
