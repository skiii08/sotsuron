The Ring," Outstanding, as well as scary
","A very well made film that I enjoyed greatly.  Scarier (if it is possible) than The Shining and Psycho.  Creates a tremendous atmosphere of intensity and fright.  Do not go alone.  One fault, if it can be called one, is the lack of levity to release built up tension, but if you let yourself be scared, you will have a lot more fun.  It also has a rather good ending for a horror/thriller movie.  Altogether a wonderful experience, rating a 9/10.",8,0,0,31 October 2002
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Great fun
","I just saw this movie, and had a great time.  Once again, The Terminator is back, along with an extremely hot T-X, played by Kristanna Loken.  Great action scenes, raw violence, and more than adequate acting carry it very well.  Not as original as the first two, but still comes up with creative fight scenes.  A fair amount of amusing dialogue is also present.  Overall, very enjoyable, and quite well made.  I would recommend it to most people, and give it an 8.6 out of 10, or 9 out of 10.",7,0,1,3 July 2003
28 Days Later...," Enjoyable
","'Possible Mild Spoilers Ahead: Proceed with caution.'
I just saw this film.  After greatly liking Romero's 'Night of the Living Dead' and 'Dawn of the Dead,' I was expecting a slight twist on zombies, from what I had read in reviews and so forth.  And that's what I got. Quite scary, rather tense, and greatly atmospheric, the movie, filmed on digital video, succeeds in packing a punch.  However, it was this same filming that irritated me.  Unlike the calm, almost peaceful directing of 'Rosemary's Baby,' '28 Days Later...' insists on constantly flashing images at us.  So quick and fast, it plays almost like an MTV music video.  It greatly bothered me, unlike 'Lola Rennt,' which used the same technique masterfully. Nevertheless, I still greatly enjoyed it.  Being a fan of horror films, I wasn't disappointed.  The girl with whom I saw it didn't particularly care for the ending.  But, I ask, how else can a zombie horror film end?  The other endings they filmed are also possible, with Jim dying and so forth, but the best way, in my opinion, is to leave it to the audience to imagine them being rescued.  In conclusion, it's not the best horror or zombie flick, but does add a new dimension to zombies.  However, this was slightly offset by the directing, which irritated me constantly.  In purely technical terms, I would give this a 7 out of 10, but with my bias toward this genre, my final score is 8 out of 10.P.S. Why the male nudity?  And so much of it.  Is that something British?Oh, well.",8,0,1,2 July 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," Worth watching? Of course.
","Spoilers may be present.  Reader Discretion Advised. After reading several reviews of this film, you may wonder if it is worth your time and money to see.  The answer would have to be an emphatic 'Yes.' Is it awesome?  Amazingly so.  Is it good?  Yes, but not great.To start with, the action sequences alone are worth everything.  One scene in particular, in which Neo fights a multitude of Agent Smith's, may well be one of the most spectacular scenes in cinema history.  I couldn't keep my jaw from dropping throughout. In addition, one of the best car chases ever, if it can be called that, is also amazingly spectacular.  Jumping from cars onto other cars and destroying all of them was fantastic. Other fight scenes, including ones with hand weapons, unlike 'The Matrix,' are similarly amazing. Now for some moderately bad news.  The story is far from good.  It seems convoluted at times, and at other times contrived to be more confusing and 'thought provoking' than it may really be.  Some of the dialogue consists solely of characters speaking with large words, which, even if understood, fail to convey any true meaning.In addition, the sex scene is a little lengthy, and, while I believe it is necessary to show the consummation of Neo and Trinity's relationship, seems to detract from the film. In spite of these errors, 'The Matrix Reloaded' is fantastic to watch, containing the best fight scenes ever.  The previous honor belonged to 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,' but this far eclipses everything it did.In conclusion, it is well worth watching, and, but for a few story and script flaws, would have been a great movie.  Without the special effects, the most I could give it would be a seven.  However, with them, it earns an 8 out of 10.",8,0,0,15 May 2003
