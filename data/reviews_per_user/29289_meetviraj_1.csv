Scarface," The legend that is Al Pacino
","I have seen this flick many times, and I think that Al Pacino's performance in this one is probably the only high point of the movie. The script is very good, but I believe it could have been directed a lot better. No character, except Tony Montana, is good enough to leave an impression. The violence shown is rude and not classy. I think the background score is also on of the good aspects in this movie. The climax is not very good, it starts to get boring as the movie closes. There are quite few smart comments and dialogues though. Pacino is at his best, maybe at par with godfather. His is undoubtedly one of the greatest actor.",8,1,2,5 July 2005
