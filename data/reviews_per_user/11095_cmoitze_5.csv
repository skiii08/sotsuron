Black Swan," Very good
","Black Swan concerns the life of Ballerina Nina Sayers, and her quest to be perfect and obtain the coveted lead role of The Black Swan. But there are obstacles in her way, such as an over protective mother, a sleazy director and jealous dancers. Has she got what it takes to carry off this role?First of all Black Swan is not a horror movie. It is more of a dark drama. Many people have gone into this movie with the wrong expectations, believing this to be a gory horror movie. There are plenty of disturbing moments, but these are more psychological in nature.For me this movie had the perfect mix of characterisation, mood and some nice point of view shots. I never knew quite where this movie was heading and this maintained my interest throughout. There has been a lot of care taken with crafting this movie and it shows. Great acting from all concerned, especially Natalie Portman going from naive, insecure girl to decadent vamp. Vincent Cassel is also great as her sleazy director.This is more of an adult thriller and thankfully, there are no annoying teenage characters with clich√©d dialog. Catch this in the cinema if you can, as the soundtrack sounds great in surround sound. Recommended!",8,3,5,2 February 2011
Mississippi Burning," Powerful and insightful
","Mississippi Burning concerns the story of three civil rights activists that disappear one night without a trace in Mississippi. Two detectives are assigned to the case, amidst a backdrop of racial hatred and deceit. No one is willing to talk about what really happened that night on the lonely stretch of road.This movie is a must see, It portrays the south as it was in 1964 with great accuracy and honesty. Films like this need to be made, warts and all, that depict the racial ugliness of the time. Some people argue that stories like this should be sanitized, because they are too politically incorrect. I disagree, for this is how history was, and it needs to be shown in an accurate light, no matter how hard it is to watch.The two leads are great, particularly Willem Dafoe, as detective Ward who is determined that justice will be served, whether the crime victim is white or black.I found this movie to be honest and insightful, telling history as it really was. If you are looking for an entertaining and educational movie, I can recommend Mississippi Burning. Nine stars!",9,1,1,6 February 2011
Shutter Island," Modern masterpiece
","Shutter Island is a breath of fresh air. An Intelligent and thought provoking film, that had my attention from beginning to end. Leonardo Dicaprio is on top form here, turning in a very credible performance as the troubled lead character.Wonderful musical score and atmospheric sets make this film extremely entertaining. The movie has a surprising ending that will make you ponder exactly what did happen.Some nice subtexts flowing through the film which will leave the viewer with questions to ponder and reflect on, long after the movie has finished.In summary, this movie can be recommended as a thinking mans horror film. Entertaining for sure, but with a depth and gravitas so often lacking in the horror genre.",9,3,6,3 January 2011
The Thing," Carpenter does it again!
","This movie is a remake of the 1951 film. It concerns an Alien organism that has landed in Antarctica and now wants to take over mankind by infecting them one by one.The Thing is without doubt, one of the all time greats. The special effects in this movie have to be seen to be believed, all the more remarkable when you consider they were all made from model work. No computer generated rubbish here, just real craftsmanship. Current movie makers please take note.All the acting is very credible and conveys the paranoia and genuine fear these men feel, as no one can tell who is infected.Great musical score by Ennio Morricone adds to the tension. This movie is a must see, though definitely not for the squeamish as the effects are quite gruesome. If you are after realistic alien terror you can't beat this movie. It still packs a punch today and will exceed any current horror movie on the screen. 10 out of 10. Unforgettable!",10,0,1,9 January 2011
Halloween," Brilliant Carpenter
","Halloween is possibly the greatest horror film ever made. There is not much gore, but the atmosphere is unbelievable. Carpenter has created a chilling musical score, that even today sends shivers up my spine. This is complemented by fantastic lighting and camera angles and lovely shots from the killers point of view, especially at the beginning of the film.The acting is also very credible, especially from Donald Pleasence as the dogmatic Dr Loomis. Jamie Lee Curtis also puts in a strong performance making the whole situation very believable.The protagonist is Micheal Myers who has escaped from a sanitarium on Halloween night and heads back to his home town to wreak havoc, where 15 years earlier he murdered his sister.The mask Micheal wears is super creepy and the fact that he doesn't speak lends an eerie unknown to his character.This movie comes highly recommended to horror fans and indeed cinema enthusiasts in general. Not to be confused with the inferior Rob Zombie remake. 10 out of 10.",10,0,2,9 January 2011
