Saturday Night Fever," I love this movie
","And I love Staying Alive but rewatching this so many years later, I am floored by the sexism and misogyny rampant throughout SNF. Women are regularly called sl-ts, c-nts, and b-tches, and treated like garbage. Not as enjoyable to watch anymore.
EDIT - oh, and there's a rape scene, which Travolta's character listens to while it's happening, and then proceeds to call the victim a c-nt afterward. WTHF??? It is stupefying that I have watched this multiple times in my youth and never even noticed it, and no one ever mentions any of this when the film is discussed.",8,0,1,6 December 2019
Hereditary," Thin and predictable story
","The rug, seriously?The characters need their histories shown, rather than mentioned in dialogue. Outlines rather than evolving, substantial characters don't give viewers much to invest in, though the film really wants you to be wrapped up with the characters.Many really good horror scenes but memorable for the scenes, not the film as a cohesive story. Good acting but direction and editing were off in some places.So much amazing potential regarding the themes and story but didn't come together for me.",6,0,1,22 August 2018
A Star Is Born," Wonderful but
",Too many montages of their evolution. Beautiful performances but it was like watching a photo album.,7,0,5,17 November 2018
Us," No
","I get that this film is an allegory and I came up with about 4 interpretations as I watched it, mostly in an attempt to make the film interesting. It didn't work.I'm not going to pretend this film is a masterpiece by a great auteur because everyone else seems to think it is. It's not. It was like a brutally long student film with a big budget.Good idea, great cast; execution was an ineffective, boring mess.",3,2,3,27 May 2019
Knives Out," I don't get the hype for this movie
",It was a little boring and too long. Great cast but I don't see why it deserves all this acclaim.,5,19,30,7 February 2020
Aquaman," Bad
","After 10 min I skipped through the rest of the film. Boring, insanely over-the-top CGI, and bad dialogue. Was like watching a video game.",2,29,58,2 February 2019
The Favourite," Delightful
","I found this film very funny, it could have gone much further for me. I guess if this kind of humour is not your cup of tea, there's not much here for you. Definitely one of this year's best films, gorgeous in every aspect. Wonderful performances.Didn't care for the way film ended as I wanted it to continue.LOVE the music, brilliant.",8,7,13,13 February 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Great film
","I loved this film. It is a strangely moving film, and I only vaguley know who Sharon Tate is as the headline of the tragedy that befell her. The sixties are foreign to me, too, except what I've seen in films, so Tarantino's love of that era allows him to really capture the essence and translate it to the viewer because I was completely caught up in it.There is controversy apparently that Tate was 'sidelined' in the film, but I thought she perfectly embodies that time and music and I think that's what Tarantino was going for maybe. She seems lovely, and full of light, and I imagine the goal was to capture that light and keep it going, now forever, in this rewrite of what happened. I kept dreading the scene that was coming but when it didn't, it made the loss even more palpable, and also made me happy.It's also a very funny film, and an absolute joy to watch visually. The acting is excellent, Brad Pitt is really good. Caprio is as always, perfect.",8,0,0,3 December 2019
The Game," Just watched this for about the 8th time
",And I still love it. I cry at the end every time I watch it. It's a very moving story and a beautifully constructed film.,8,2,3,8 December 2019
Call Me by Your Name," Beautiful
",Exquisite. I was filled with heartache and longing from beginning to end. A film hasn't made me feel so much in a long time.,9,0,1,23 January 2018
The Da Vinci Code," 7.5/10
","Just watching this as entertainment, and not trying to research its historical accuracy, it is a very engrossing, fun mystery, full of intrigue. It is also interesting as a political commentary on religion, and the oppression of women. It was 2.5 hours and felt like less than 2 hours. I haven't read the book.",7,0,0,24 April 2020
Joker," Amazing
","I'm too stunned to give this a 10/10 even though it is an absolutely perfect film in every way. I keep thinking it can't be as good as I think it is, it's too perfect.Even with all the hype, this film EXCEEDS expectations. Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing, and the film is gorgeous. It's gut wrenching and heartbreaking but so beautiful it's surreal.",9,3,5,10 November 2019
