Blade Runner 2049," Leave ALL your expectations at home
","To make this 160+ min. monstrosity with nothing more than a paper thin story, with actors that can't even act being emotionally distant robots, with so-called futuristic booming sounds going off with every little pathetic emotion happening to the main character, the director literally blew every scene to a lengthy 5, 10 or 15 minutes annoyance fest. I had very few expectations when going to this film. But I had some. So I got utterly disappointed since even those low expectations weren't met! I'm genuinely amazed that this director has managed to make a dull, lifeless film from beginning to end. But then again he f*cked up 'Arrival' as well, so I shouldn't be surprised. Also congrats to the writer who managed to screw over his own legacy!",1,57,207,4 October 2017
127 Hours," Unbelievable storyline
","Strange that no one has pointed out that the basis around which this story evolves (the cutting off of the arm) is hardly believable. First, you'll probably bleed to death since many important arteries and veins pass through the arm. If you can't bind or burn the ends of the blood vessels you've cut, they are unlikely to stop bleeding. Secondly, if you cut yourself, you feel an intense pain, even after feelings of numbness due to dehydration or hunger. What then if you chop off your entire arm!? Thirdly, the tensors (and the bone) in the arm are very resilient, even with a good knife. And fourth, what about infections? You can hardly say he cut his arm off in hygienic circumstances! To conclude: I really don't believe the bit in the story where he amputates his arm and lives to tell the story. This guy probably had a severe infection in his arm in the middle of nowhere, got it amputated or did it himself in other than the in the film mentioned circumstances and made the rest up. Untruthfull story!",5,1,7,8 January 2011
