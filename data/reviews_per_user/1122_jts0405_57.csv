The Benchwarmers," A Few Good Laughs
","Rob Schneider, David Spade, and Jon Heder play Gus, Richie, and Clark. They are 2 guys that didn't get respect. Because Gus was a bully back in his childhood days but he is playing for a team against it. The Benchwarmers are a 3 man team playing against bully teams all over the state. Nelson is the son of billionaire Mel. Nelson is a kid that always gets picked on by bullies. This is the reason that Gus, Richie, and Clark take a stand and play the bullies at baseball games. Reggie Jackson, Jon Lovitz, Nick Swardson, Craig Kilborn, and Tim Meadows from Saturday Night Live co star in the comedy The Benchwarmers. It has a few good laughs in it. For the most part it is a about average film. A usually Adam Sandler and Rob Schneider movie dialog. This is enjoyable and it teaches you that it is not good to pick on people and be a bully and winning isn't everything.",10,0,1,8 May 2006
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Offensive/Raunchy/Graphic/Hilarious/Outrageous Movie
","Borat is really one of the most offensive/raunchy/hilarious movies of all time. This movie really is a huge step up from Baron Cohen's Ali G Indahouse movie several years earlier. That movie included a real cast and was an actual written movie. This on the other hand was Sacha Baron Cohen going around in his Borat persona playing hoaxes on unsuspecting people. Even though he did this to these people with their consent and even though he wrote some offensives things into this it was an extremely hilarious movie. Some may not agree with me, some on the other hand might agree. All in all it was a movie that will most likely be talked about for a long time to come. This may even become a cult classic someday.",10,0,0,10 December 2008
The Hangover," High Expectations get Surpassed
","It is about time that we see Bradley Cooper as a leading man, he has performed so well in comedies like Wet Hot American Summer, Wedding Crashers and last year's Yes Man with Jim Carrey. On the other hand his co-stars of Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis perform better than most of the familiar comedy genre faces. This movie was already held with high expectations before it was released, but those expectations have truly been met and surpassed altogether. Now at first I was hesitant, because the whole Rated R gross out comedy style is getting recycled way too much lately, but this actually turned out to be a hilarious movie, with nothing seeming like it was recycled from Judd Apatow, Adam Sandler or Kevin Smith movies. The cast actually is made up of people that normally have to take the backseat as cameo people or supporting people, and they truly deliver and showcase why they need to lead more often in films. All in all you really get what you expect and more from The Hangover. The characters are likable, the story is something new and different, plus you get a lot of laughs that don't seem like they have been stolen from the Apatow/Sandler movies. This is truly the breakout comedy of the summer and probably one of the funniest movies of the year 2009.10/10",10,25,48,8 June 2009
Meet the Parents," Funny Movie
","Meet the Parents is the original of the two movies that deal with the relationship of Gaylord 'Greg' Focker (Ben Stiller) and Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo). So basically this movie mostly consists on Focker traveling with his girlfriend for a wedding to also meet her parents. From start to finish this movie entertains and definitely delivers the laughs. Robert De Niro is normally known as a serious actor and even though he may come off as a little serious in this movie, he definitely is funny as hell when he plays Jack Byrnes. So definitely check out Meet the Parents if you get the chance, because it will definitely entertain you from the opening to end credits when you put it in the DVD player.10/10",10,1,1,26 August 2008
The Big Lebowski," A Cult Classic
","For one thing, when this film was in theaters nobody even cared, now so many people know it by heart that it's not even funny. This film is absolutely the best in all ways. John Goodman put on the roll of his life as Walter. This has to be the best thing I have ever seen John Goodman do. As for the rest of the actors, it all seemed to stay on a pretty good track. The Coen Brothers scored again with this movie. It was a great movie and well enjoyed by people all around. This was an absolute treasure to have on the shelf. The Coen Brothers are making gold, but this has to be their best so far. If they were to make a sequel it would be impossible, because Jeff Bridges would take a lot to look like The Dude again. Well long live The DUDE!!!!",10,0,1,4 February 2007
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Another funny Apatow movie
","First and foremost the main reason I went to see this was because it was a movie made by the Apatow group. I thought that it would be a nice breath of fresh air to see Jason Segal as the main star, because we normally see Seth Rogen leading in the Apatow movies. I expected a funny movie because previous movies such as The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Kncocked Up and Superbad were hilarious. This movie does fit into the caliber that those movies did, but it wasn't as great as they were. I was still pleasantly surprised with this movie, but it wasn't the greatest comedy I have ever seen. So to all of the Apatow fans, this will be worth checking out.8/10",8,1,4,5 October 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Action Packed
","Through out this entire movie you see lots of hardcore action. Sadly in the end Jack Sparrow dies and the Black Pearl sinks down in the water. Barbarosa comes in the end and seems to be coming to help the gang in the next Pirates movie. You can tell by the ending that you are going to see another one made. We really don't know if Elizabeth is with William Turner or not. She seemed really really sad that Jack jumped in and died, supposedly. Davey Jones is really a great villain for this deep sea type movie. This is really a launching pad for action Disney Movies. This is more adult than your usually Toy Story movie. I enjoyed folks and hope the nest Pirates comes out soon as early 2007.",7,3,6,12 July 2006
Happy Gilmore," The Best Golf Movie Since Caddyshack
","Adam Sandler as Happy Gilmore brings laughs once again to the career of Adam Sandler. This movie is one of the movies Sandler started out with. Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore are both the two movies Adam Sandler started out with. Going Overboard was no professional movie at all. With Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore you have Happy Madison Productions. Happy Madison has done well good movies. They did the first Deuce Bigelow and they did Dickie Roberts Former Child Star. Adam has come from Saturday Night Live with all he knows and has acted with what he knows. David Spade, Chris Farley, Dana Carvey, Mike Myers, Ben Stiller, Steve Martin, and Bill Murray are the other men who have done well after Saturday Night Live. Adam Sandler still has a great career ahead of him.",10,6,9,27 December 2005
The Rocker," A Decent Movie
","The Rocker is one of those come from behind movies during the summer time. I never knew that it was coming out until I saw an ad for it on the front page of Youtube's website. I then started to see more and more trailers of it once I went to see several movies. From what I saw, it looked like a decent enough movie to check out. This was really Rainn Wilson's first big gig in a movie, mostly you see him playing Dwight on the sitcom 'The Office'. Basically it was better than I expected, it kept the audience busy and there was a nice amount of laughter from the audience. This wasn't the best movie of the summer, but it was an enjoyable one.",6,2,6,17 August 2008
Balls of Fury," Decent Movie
","Balls of Fury was really dumb at points, but it still turned out to be a decent enough film. The whole story seemed to be kind of strange. I would like to share some spoilers, but I don't want to give it all away. The ending was a head scratcher. I believe that this will go down as a love it or hate it movie. Many hate it, although many love it. A ton of cameos came out of this movie, Diedrich Bader, Christopher Walken and many more made appearances in this movie. I definitely would watch this a few times more. It turned out to be decent as I said before, but it could of had more of Christopher Walken in it. I have to admit that Christopher Walken is good in any role given to him, this was no exception.",7,4,8,3 September 2007
"I Love You, Man"," I Love You, Man delivers huge laughs
","From the fame of their Apatow productions, both Paul Rudd and Jason Segel reunite once again for I Love You, Man. After teaming partially in 2007's Knocked Up and last year's smash hit Forgetting Sarah Marshall, we have really seen chemistry grow between the two. Rudd stars this time, unlike Role Models in which he was the second wingman to Seann William Scott. Rudd portrays the friendless Peter Klaven, who knows how to really impress women and be romantic. The main problem occurs when he proposes to his girlfriend Zooey (Rashida Jones), but he has no best man for his wedding. Goaded by his homosexual brother (Andy Samberg) he goes on a series of failed man dates until finally meeting Sydney Fife (Jason Segel). For the first time we really see Segel break out as a wild man character. He was more straight laced in Forgetting Sarah Marshall and sort of a supporting character in Knocked Up. This may appear, like Forgetting Sarah Marshall, as a romantic comedy. But even adding in that factor I find this movie still to be one of the funniest movies of this year so far. I may recall that this is the first time I really have had some great laughs towards something done or said by Jason Segel. With a decent cast and some hilarious scenes you really get what you expect from I Love You, Man.10/10",10,2,5,6 April 2009
Superbad," Great Movie
","At first I didn't know what to expect from Superbad. It seemed like a good movie from some of the commercials and from other commercials it seemed like it would suck. Then once I got to the movie theater I really thought that it was great. Michael Cera and Jonah Hill have tremendous chemistry in this movie. The whole story is really about nothing, which was easy for me to get into it. The best parts have to go to Fogell. The entire Fogell character stole the movie. Seth Rogen and Bill Hader also showed some great chemistry as the cops. The entire movie was down right great. It was funny, disgusting at points, but all together it was a killer movie to have been made.",7,1,4,3 September 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Great Way to end the Trilogy
","The final installment of the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy. It fit right into the other two movies and their caliber. The brining back of Jack Sparrow was a must because you couldn't do a pirates movie without Johnny Depp. Some of the things that went down in this final movie were things that I would have never expected. More of a story about Davy Jones was told in this movie, it was more about why he cut out his heart. It all and all made a excellent showing at the theater, but the original will always stick out as the best of the three. Even though the second and third movie showed tons of excellence in movie making, you have to go with the original version. Kudos to the pirates trilogy, it was a fun one to watch.",10,7,11,9 June 2007
Spider-Man 3," Worth The Money
","Every Spiderman movie so far has been a good movie making Hollywood experience. This one had the potential and went to big heights. I believe this is the best of the trilogy. Bringing in not 1, but 2 villains was kind of cool for once. We got to see the Sandman and Venom in one total movie. I am finally glad that they used Venom, which is one of my favorite Spidey enemies. To me this showed a little more humor and comedy than the other two. Not that this movie was intended to be a comedy, just it had it's moments were it seemed kind of like a comedic film. In any event this is one that you either have to go see right now or wait to buy or rent it when it comes out in a few months. Either way you see it, theater or at your own home, it's a thrilling movie experience. A classic in the Spiderman movies. I like this better than the other of the trilogy.",10,5,9,18 May 2007
Yes Man," Pretty Good movie for Jim Carrey
","It has been awhile since Jim Carrey has come out with a comedy. His sad attempt at drama came in the form of The Number 23 last year in 2007, which completely sucked in all forms of sucking. Now he returns to the genre he shines in and that is comedy. This movie doesn't deliver laughs nonstop like in his other films, but the laughs are more realistic unlike other Carrey movies in which he does some crazy antics. We also see some decent supporting performances from Bradley Cooper and Danny Masterson, who play Carrey's friends. The movie actually does play Carrey as a totally different character, he normally is a fun loving character, but in the beginning he is portrayed as an uptight person that never has any fun. It all changes and the plot unfolds when he begins to say yes to everything, which brings a pretty funny cameo from Terrence Stamp. The movie actually ends on a decent moral, with him deciding to only say yes to things he wants to and learning the true meaning of saying yes. So basically it is worth a watch.",7,4,6,8 June 2009
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," I'm not one for Musicals, but this was great
","I was dragged to this last January, a month after it came out, and literally went there with low expectations. First and foremost because I despise musicals. They are not my kind of movie at all. I don't know just I don't like them at all. Anyway this starts out with the music numbers and I wasn't really feeling it, but it grew on me. Mainly it grew on me with the crime edge to it. The way he killed all those people and how those two ran their business really kept the movie interesting. This also features a very star studded cast including Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Alan Rickman and Sacha Baron Cohen. A definite must see, because it actually was a fantastic movie in my book.9/10",9,0,0,10 December 2008
Blades of Glory," Will Ferrell + Jon Heder = A Good Comedy
","When I was told that Will Ferrell and Jon Heder were paring up, I literally knew that I had to see this movie. I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. I expected it to suck because the whole thing balanced around figure skating, but it really didn't suck at all and was actually quite good. I expected it to be more of a serious sport movie, but it turned out more of a comedy movie. Will Ferrell and Jon Heder did a great job playing rivals that turn into friends at the end. Also you see performances from Craig T. Nelson, Will Arnett, Amy Poehler, Nick Swardson and Romany Malco among others. So if you haven't already, go check out Blades of Glory.",8,1,2,23 August 2008
Nacho Libre," I Went Back
","A friar named Ignacio cares and cooks for the orphan boys at his orphanage. When Ignacio sees famous wrestler Ramses he loves the way the fans and crowd treat him, but at the mean time a new teacher and nun has come into the orphanage. Ignacio gets feelings for her and she ends up show him what to really fight for. Ignacio then meets Isqueleto or Steven. The tow join together as a tag team in the ranks and lose to the manys of tag teams around. Ignacio then changes his ring name to Nacho. The fans chant him and all, and he does not enjoy losing. When they go to the party at Ramses' manager's house they ask to be pros. His manager tells them to compete in this big 8 man match to settle who will fight Ramses. Nacho and Steven then both lose and El Silenco is victor. Then as fight night is coming up Steven runs over El Silenco's foot and thus for he can not wrestle because in Steven's term's he bruised his bunyans and there swollen bad. So since Nacho is second place he goes to fight Ramses to win money to buy the orphans a bus to go on field trips.He ends up pinning Ramses and the crowd goes wild. He buys the bus and they go on a trip in the end.In my view the best part of the movie is his song.''I ate some leaves, I ate some grass, I use my hand to wipe my tears''",10,0,6,5 July 2006
Forrest Gump," One Of The Best Movies Ever Made
","Forrest Gump, Jenny Curan, Bubba Blue, Lt. Dan Taylor, and Momma Gump. Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump, Robin Wright as Jenny Curan, Mykelti Williamson as Bubba, Gary Sinsie as Lt. Dan Taylor, and Sally Field as Momma Gump. This movie is spectacular. For 2 hours and 21 minutes I enjoyed myself watching Forrest Gump. This movie is truly a classic in my book with most of the phrazies. RUN FORREST RUN, LIFE IS LIKE A BOX OF CHOCOLATES. This movie is a mix of drama and comedy. Forrest Gump is a movie to watch almost everyday. After seeing how Jenny treats him who would think about her anymore seriously. She completely treats him bad and he still loves her.",10,1,5,25 December 2005
American Pie," A Good DVD to own on your shelf
",The first American Pie really set the ground work for the others to follow. Although there are too many to count now and a million different Stiflers you still think back to the first pie movie. It really lead the plot through the sequels and spin-offs. If I ever catch this one on TV I will turn to it right away because it is truly a great teenage sex comedy. The two sequels to follow were not as great as this because it is the piece of pie that sliced it open for the others to follow through. I enjoyed this movie a lot and recommend seeing this before any of the other knock offs or sequels. Jason Biggs really pulls through as the nerdy high school guy that is just trying to get a little action. So if you haven't already seen this then see it sometime soon.,8,0,0,31 October 2008
Hot Rod," Actually a pretty Hysterical movie
","Andy Samberg has always appeared funny to me and this is really his first big work since becoming an actor. This is literally a movie that many will say is terrible, but it really isn't. This movie is entirely just a nonstop hilarious movie. I didn't have high expectations and I will admit that, but after giving it a try I feel like it really was worth it in the end. All in all many people that enjoy the new SNL, I personally don't, will like this movie. I did enjoy the humor in this movie even though I don't normally watch SNL lately, but regardless of that this is still a very hilarious movie and worth checking out.9/10",9,0,3,10 December 2008
Little Miss Sunshine," Are You Kidding Me
","This has to be the worst ever. Steve Carrell has done great movies like 40-Year-Old Virgin and Anchorman. This just totally didn't click at all. The whole base is to take a trip the a beauty contest for their little daughter or whatever not to win. You kind of thought, hey maybe they'll let the girl win after all this. But no it ended in her taking defeat and at least being glad she tried it. That was cool but the whole movie was just stupid beyond stupid. I couldn't even watch it and had to turn it off. I remember just how dumb it turned out to be. I hoped it would have been better and tried it again the next day. But still it just never clicked with me. I thought it was a very poor movie and Steve Carrell should wait a while till his next movie, because this was pretty bad.",1,9,22,6 January 2007
Wanted," A Decent Movie
","Wanted to me was a really decent movie. It was really well done and really put together well. The cast to me really was entertaining, it was the right choice of people to play those parts. The story was also a very original and interesting plot to get into. He's just a normal person like all of us then he gets in with this fraternity of assassins. Morgan Freeman did an excellent job as well as Angeline Jolie. Wanted is definitely a movie that would be good to check out if you and your friends are hanging out and need something to do. It really was an entertaining movie. The whole thing was full of great cast and great story.",7,5,14,26 June 2008
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," A Fresh and New Experiment for Apatow
","Normally we see Seth Rogen leading in the Apatow movies. Just recently he has broke onto the screen with Knocked Up and Pineapple Express. It is all well and good to see Rogen make a name for himself, but I found it to be a great decision to see John C. Reilly get a change to make a huge starring budget in this one. Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story is a different approach in Apatow's film career. It may include drugs and sex like all of his other movies, but the main back drop is the life of a musician. With a different cast involved instead of the regular Apatow clan. You really find yourself laughing a lot during this movie, because you see Dewey Cox experiment with music through every single time period that a revolution of music happened. So if you are a fan of Judd Apatow and a person who does enjoy the work of John C. Reilly I would check this out.",9,0,0,31 October 2008
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," A Hysterical Movie
","The 40-Year-Old Virgin was the first ever Apatow Company comedy, in which Steve Carell plays Andy who is 40 and yet still a virgin. So the whole basis is that he is being goaded by his fellow co-workers at Smart Tech to try and lose his virginity. I truly think that this is one of the best Apatow movies to have ever been made, this one was truly better than Knocked Up and on the same level as Superbad. This movie is more of an adult movie about a man that is trying to grow up by losing virginity. While on his way up to losing it he becomes the floor manager of Smart Tech and things turn around for him. In the end it all pays off and he truly grows up. So if you like the work of Judd Apatow then watch this movie, because this started it all.10/10",10,1,4,3 September 2008
Tropic Thunder," The Funniest Movie of 2008
","I just caught Tropic Thunder last night at my local movie theater and I must say that I was extremely surprised. I have waited months to see this movie and when I finally got the chance it did not disappoint me at all. The characters very definitively make the movie what it is, you have to have the right characters or the movie will not succeed and this movie definitely did have the right characters saying the right things at the right time. Robert Downey Jr. really did a hilarious job as Kirk Lazarus and Tom Cruise as well did a fantastic job as Les Grossman. You have so many well known actors like Ben Stiller, Jack Black, Robert Downey Jr., Jay Barchurel, Nick Nolte, Bill Hader, Tom Cruise, etc. that the entire thing put together just entertains. I have to recommend that this movie is a great way to spend an hour and a half to two hours.10/10",10,1,6,7 September 2008
Quantum of Solace," Bond is Back!
","I really enjoyed Casino Royale because Daniel Craig has done such a phenomenal job with the James Bond character. He has really captured the character well in his own unique way. This movie really had some high expectations for me because Casino Royale was really well done. I immediately felt obligated to buy a ticket to Quantom of Solace just to see what it was like. This movie was really good, it was on the same level as Casino Royale in all aspects. I was satisfied with this movie because it lived up to my expectations. Daniel Craig continued his fantastic run as Bond in this movie and I hope they keep him around doing Bond movies for a very long time. A must see for fans of the Bond movies.9/10",9,1,5,19 November 2008
The Love Guru," R.I.P. to Mike Myers' Career
","OK so first of all many people out there know that Mike Myers was the star of Wayne's World 1 & 2, Austin Powers 1-3 and many other notable comedies. Some may also know him from Saturday Night Live back in the 90's when he did several skits with Ben Stiller, Chris Farley, Dana Carvey, etc. But anyway we go from all of these great achievements to the Love Guru. It normally works when Myers plays more than one character but in this movie when he plays Young Pitka, Teenage Pitka, Guru Pitka and himself it is just not as funny as when he played Dr. Evil, Austin Powers, Fat Bastard and Goldmember in previous Austin Powers movies. Mike also found success with the cartoon movie Shrek, which has really started to water down after part 3. I would even go out on a limb and say that Shrek the Third was better than The Love Guru and that was a bad movie. Myers really continues to try and be active out there and I respect him for that, but people want to see his memorable work. After all he left it open for an Austin Powers IV at the end of the third one. People wanted to see Austin Powers IV instead of a lackluster Love Guru movie. Plus why the hell are we watching Justin Timberlake crack incredibly terrible two bit jokes? The whole smuggling a schnauzer thing sounds like a rip off Austin Powers or Wayne's World joke. To all fans of Mike Myers it looks like we will never see another Austin Powers or possibly a Wayne's World reunion movie. Instead we will be treated to at least 15 more Shrek movies and possibly The Love Guru Part II. To all of Myers' fans, let's keep chanting Yeah Baby and Schwing, maybe he will hear us and give up this Shrek Love Guru nonsense.",1,10,21,24 June 2008
Batman Begins," The Best Batman Movie Ever
","Christian Bale plays the best Batman in any of the movies yet. Bruce Wayne a man feared and afraid of bats. His final true resolution is to fight crime in a black suit and as that he gets a name from his victims, The Batman. This movie is action packed and loaded with drama and comedy Batman's character is shown more in this movie than in the others. In the other movies they show the story of the villain but in this they show more of Batman's story. This isn't taking from the other movies. I don't care what most of you say about how bad this is and what a terrible movie and could have been better. This movie is the best true Batman movie and this is a movie for the animal the bats",10,3,3,31 December 2005
Meet the Fockers," A Satisfactory Sequel
","Meet the Parents was definitely a great comedy and yes so was Meet the Fockers, but in a little more of an essence Meet the Parents was better. Meet the Fockers basically picks up where Meet the Parents left off, only this time it is Pam and her parents who are meeting the parents. Dustin Hoffman and Barbara Streishand do an excellent job as playing the Fockers and the constant humor makes this movie a very satisfying one. Dustin Hoffman, Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller all pair as very great leading men material in this comedy, they have a decent chemistry mixed between all of their separate experiences in movies.10/10, not as good as the original but still worth watching many times.",10,0,0,26 August 2008
Man on the Moon," Some Will Love It! Some Will Hate It!
",In my opinion this movie was great.Some of you may hate this movie and think it is the most stupidest movie ever made.This does tough show the personal life of comedian and actor Andy Kaufman. This movie has a great personal part of chapters.1st is Latka and Vic Ferrari 2nd is Elvis 3rd is When Andy played the Congo's and 4th is when he was the Bad Guy Wrestler.George Shapiro actually having Danny DeVito portray him he is this film. Bob Zmuda also is in this but is portrayed by Paul Giamatti. Jerry Lawler appears in this for his fake defeating of Andy Kaufman in the 80s.In some cases this is Jim Carrey's best or worst performance.But that is up to you.,10,1,2,18 February 2006

Owen Wilson, Larry The Cable Guy, Bonnie Hunt, and many other voice talents. Cars is great family fun and is a perfect movie in every way. This just may beat Finding Nemo, Monster's Inc and The Incredbles.I think that Cars was enjoyable the whole movie, there wasn't one part I didn't like. This is a classic in the making.Pixar you have done it again, you have brought us another great movie to enjoy for all time.",10,7,10,24 July 2006

","Ben Affleck and Matt Damon write their first movie really and it turns out to be Good Will Hunting. You would expect it to be more of a comedy non dramatic type of movie, but this is actually a really good dramatic movie. Also starring is the well known Robin Williams alongside Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. This really was a decent movie with an extremely well known cast. The story really sets the pace for the movie and director Gus Van Sant did a great job as he has done previously in his movies. So this may be worth the check out if you are curious to see what Damon and Affleck can do with their writing skills.8/10",8,1,4,4 December 2008

John Cleese and Julie Andrews are the parents of princess Fiona in this movie and I have to say they play that part well. They are perfect for each other. If you see Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, and John Cleese were all raw comedians before and now they are in children movies and John Cleese works for the humor department on TBS. This movie is worth the money and worth your time if you are a Shrek fan or a Eddie Murphy fan this movie if for you.",10,31,46,24 July 2006
Jerry Maguire," Cameron Crowe once again writes a memorable movie
","Cameron Crowe is probably one of the most talented writers in the movie business. He wrote the Fast Times at Ridgemont High movie back in the 80's, which is still one of the best Comedic somewhat Dramatic Romance movies of all time. This, however, is another well done creation from Mr. Crowe.Tom Cruise stars as Jerry Maguire, a sports agent. All of a sudden his perfect life completely comes tumbling down. Throughout the movie Maguire embarks a love interest with one of his new clients, played by Renee Zellwegger. Then along the way he also manages to continue managing his prospect, Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding Jr.) to the top.So really just check this one out if your looking for a Dramatic Romance story with some slight comedic material. All in all this is definitely one of Cameron Crowe's absolute best, and is not to be missed.7/10",7,2,3,7 August 2009
The Dark Knight," The Greatest Batman Movie Ever Made
","I thought that Batman Begins was the best Batman movie ever made, until seeing The Dark Knight changed my mind. This movie is packed with such a great story that it literally is beyond a Batman movie. You have to stop and think if you are really watching a Batman movie sometimes, because it is on such a reality based level. The thing I like most is that it focuses on the story of Bruce Wayne unlike other movies that just focus on the villain of the movie. Heath Ledger also put on the roll of a lifetime as The Joker. He is by far one of the best Jokers of all time in any Batman movie. So if you haven't seen The Dark Knight yet I would definitely go see it now. You will not be let down if you see this movie.",10,8,17,23 August 2008

",This movie had a great story behind it but it had terrible acting from Nicholas Cage. Seeing him try to act in a Disney Movie was funny. I fell asleep in the Movie Theater when I went to go see it. I fell asleep for about the middle of it and woke up during the almost ending of the middle of the movie. Besides Nicholas Cage and Jon Voight I didn't know anybody else in this movie. I hope they don't make a sequel to this or if I try to go see it I well have another pleasant nap. This movie had the exciting story with that just twist in it. The story was good. The movie though was terrible. The Weather Man with Nicholas Cage was good but not this movie.,1,8,16,31 December 2005
Pulp Fiction," Masterpiece from the Beginning
","When it first started out it had me locked in and ready to go. It seemed good from the first part when they were sitting in the cafÃ©. From then I was grabbed in and couldn't help but not want to go on with it. It seems to me that this deserves it's place on the IMDb Top 250. The place it is in is #5. Out of a total of the top 250 it made 5. That deserves credit, because filmmakers don't expect to write a movie that will make a top chart on a movie site. The actors made this movie. Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel and even the other side actors made this what it became. It shows a good line of America film making. It made a new genre it what movie genres are. It was sort of a drama, with a pinch of comedy and some action. That to me is a new type of genre in the eyes of making movies. I think that Tarantino really hit big when he made this movie, because now because of this one film that made big, his name will be up for grabs when a huge directing job comes up. For any that have not seen Pulp Fiction, it is an absolute must see. Rent it or buy it, anyway you should put this on a list of what to watch before you die. After it's done, you will know why.",10,0,2,17 April 2007
Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny," A Rock Opera
",Jack Black and Kyle Gass team together to promote their band Tenacious D in this Rock Classic called Tenacious D In The Pick Of Destiny. Jack Black and Kyle Gass invent their own Rock Opera..it was like an Opera of Rock 'N' Roll. Some of the most twisted events took place in that movie....the big foot part....the mushroom part....and in the end when they did the rock off against the Devil. A classic formed in Tenacious D....one of the best films I have seen in a long time. The last couple things I saw in the theater were stupid..but this movie rocks. This really made me laugh hard. The whole basis is Jack Black runs of to find his rock partner in Los Angeles. His partner is Kyle Gass and man who has always been bald. They work together to find this magic pick that can make the most terrible musician play greatly. They finally make it to the Rock 'N' Roll Museum and steal the pick. On the way they meet The Stranger Played By Tim Robbins. They make it to the club to win their prize money when the owner grabs the pick and all along he was the devil and he battles the D in a Rock Off. The D doesn't win but the Devil's horn falls off sending him back to hell. Therefore LONG LIVE THE D!!!!!!!!!!,10,1,2,27 November 2006
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," I thought it would be better than this.
",Brad Pitt really shows how strong he is by fighting Angelina Jolie. Fighting a girl Dons't prove man hood Brad. I miss the days when Brad Pitt did movies like Legends Of The Fall and Seven. Mr. & Mrs. Smith sucked compared to those movies. All and all this still was enjoyable and fun to see Brad Pitt get beat up by Angelina Jolie. Goes to show you that he doesn't have the acting skills he used to. Troy was OK just like this movie. I wish though that I could get the last hour of it back because after that it really stunk. Vince Vaughn was in it for like a minute or two. You really never see him in it. Brad Pitt is good but not like the old days.,4,2,4,4 December 2005
Wedding Crashers," Entertaining Comedy
","I didn't know what to really think from this one. I really thought that it was overrated because some people I know told me it was a horrible movie, while everyone else really loved it. So I decided to check it out one night and was actually surprised with it. Owen Wilson normally is seen as the buddy character behind Ben Stiller, but this was really his sort of make-it type of movie. Vince Vaughan takes a back seat to Wilson in this one as his best friend. All in all Vaughan really steals some scenes and delivers a ton of laughs throughout this one. I am glad I decided to check this out because it really was worth it to finally see what all the hype was about.9/10",9,1,1,10 December 2008
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Nicholson in his prime form
","One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is a classic to put it in a simple form. This movie really is just an utterly enjoyable classic movie and that is why it belongs in the top ten of the Top 250 on IMDb. Jack Nicholson was extremely young here and really witty at this point in his career. This movie is definitely a great one at that. Danny De Vito is also in this movie, which this was also one of his first projects at the time. The movie is just an amazing motion picture that really does deliver a nice amount of chuckles throughout. Nicholson really was as sharp as a tack in this movie. It is literally the primest form he has ever been in and this is his defining movie to say the least.Easily 10/10",10,1,4,27 August 2008
Army of Darkness," How Could you not like this?
","The whole Evil Dead trilogy is honestly one of the luckiest trilogies to ever be created, mainly because all three movies have been successes. This is not entitled Evil Dead III, but instead as Army of Darkness. This really picks up though where Evil Dead II left off, in which Ash lands back in time and must defend a middle age civilization. This is a lot more of a basic comedy/horror, in which Evil Dead I and II were both out for the horror. This is honestly not one to pass up and honestly key importance to watch if you wonder where he goes from Evil Dead II.10/10",10,3,4,22 June 2009
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," The Perfect Stupid Comedy
","Ron Burgundy 1970s new reporter does not know how to treat women. He thinks that they should be in the kitchen and bed and that is all. I think that his world gets turned around when a sexy new news reporter comes in. They have a relationship then that goes away after a week. This movie is perfect for a Stupid like comedy. News humor.This movie does for the news as Will Ferrell's new movie Talladega Night: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby does for Nascar. Only this movie doesn't have Sacha Baron Cohen being a gay guy in it.Finally the news gets it's own movie, that isn't serious. This at least is a comedy and not one of those serious news room movies. Steve Carrell and Will Ferrell are good friends it seems. They happen to be making dumb comedies. If you see it doesn't matter with Will Ferrell his movie may be stupid but it does not matter because he is funny as hell.",10,1,3,16 July 2006
Stranger Than Fiction," Nice Transition for Ferrell
","I tried this out because Will Ferrell is one of my favorite comedy actors of this generation. His stupid comedies are really just hilarious that you have to watch them over and over again. When I saw that he would be working with Dustin Hoffman as well I knew I had to see this, because that pair looked extremely well on paper. I have to say that I am not much of a drama genre guy, but this was a decent one at that. The whole romance thing didn't really catch me because that is not my thing but Ferrell being out of his element caught me by surprise in this one. He normally acts like such a goof in his movies that it was surprising to see him act like a normal man dealing with a dilemma. So this wouldn't be a good check out for those that love Ferrell's comedy movies, but it is good for those that like a decent drama that can entertain.",7,0,0,31 October 2008

The Shawshank Redemption," An Epic Movie
","The Shawshank Redemption is just an utterly moving motion picture that makes you really have a feel for the characters in this movie. It truly will move you in some sort of way, because it is very deeply emotional at times. Morgan Freeman did an excellent job as always and really put on an amazing role in this movie. Tim Robbins truly stole the show with his Grade A performance. If you have the time to sit through this very long movie, then you should definitely see The Shawnshank Redemption, because it is a motion picture that will make you feel in dept emotions for the characters in the movie, it is by far a classic and one of the best movies of the 90's.",10,1,2,11 August 2008
Shrek," A Classic Twisted Fairy Tale
",You can name Austin Powers and Wayne's World from Mike Myers. You can name The Golden Child and Eddie Murphy Raw from Eddie Murphy. Now they both are in a kids movie named Shrek. It is a great movie. Shrek is a classic all the way. An ogre falls in love and his friend is a donkey that won't shut up. It is a great wonderful and original movie. It is refreshing from all those old Disney movies. This really has a funny background to it. It has two Saturday Night Live breakout performers in Murphy and Myers. Cameron Diaz also hosted an episode of Saturday Night Live before. This is the first of 3 Shrek movies and this one will always be my favorite one. The wrestling scene is the best when he if fighting the soldiers. John Lithgow also stars in this wonderfully twisted fairy tale.,10,0,1,24 July 2006
Iron Man," By Far one of the Best Comic Book Movies Ever!
","Many Marvel fans out there have been treated to Spider-Man, X-Men, The Hulk, Daredevil, Ghost Rider and the Fantastic Four over the course of what we could call the 2000's. These classic comic books were taken in and made into motion pictures. I enjoyed all of them but the one I really wanted to see be made was Iron Man. Once I heard news of Iron Man being made I couldn't wait for it to come out in theaters. I didn't know what to think when I found out that Robert Downey Jr. was going to play Tony Stark, but I must say that he really surprised me. It has been a long time since I have seen him in a movie, but he really made a comeback and a huge one at that. Iron Man is by far one of the best movies of the 2008 summer season. The movie followed onto the comic book and it really turned out to be a excellent movie that every fan of not just Iron Man, but Marvel should see.",10,1,3,26 June 2008

300," Excellent Movie Making
","The action sequences were just amazing. You could think that blood was just about to jump out at you in your seat. The actors did a great job, even though most of them were unknown. The story that 300 told us was to live and die as a free person, but not live and die as a slave. The Spartans were a ruthless group that just thought against all of the Persians that wanted their things. I don't want to give to much of the film away, but this is an action classic. You don't want to pass this up. Go and buy tickets right now and enjoy the magic film making of this excellent picture. A thing that made this so great was how nobody really famous was in it. All actors and actresses that were unknown were in this and that made it truly an enjoyable classic to go down in history. In my case, if it is Frank Miller, you can't go wrong with what you are seeing.",10,3,13,25 March 2007
Click," Family First
","Adam Sandler gives a touching,tear jerking,heart warming performance. Different from his other films Click stands out one of his best. He screws up with the remote and skips the good part sex and work projects which take him a year to finish so this means his misses his wife and him going to a marriage counselor. He ends up losing his wife to his son's swim coach and he can't get a dog that won't hump the duck. This movie warms your heart and fills your eyes with warm and sad tears. The saddest part is in the end when he runs out of the hospital and is caught in the rain yelling to his son saying family is first. Then also when he relives the last time he saw his father. I recommend this to any tear jerking movie fan and to all Adam Sandler fan. You will definitely love this tale of love and it teaches us all a lesson that is true.''FAMILY FIRST'' Grade: A",10,2,9,7 July 2006
Pineapple Express," Another good offering from the Apatow Group
","The Pineapple Express is another Apatow Company produced film Starring Seth Rogen as Dale Denton and James Franco as Saul Silver. I really thought that this would be a great comedy from Apatow when I made it to the advanced screening, but I got all that and much much more. This movie isn't just a straight up comedy, it is also an action/crime movie. That to me really helped the movie out a lot. Instead of it being just another stoner comedy, it turned out to be a stoner comedy with an actual action theme to it. Rogen and Franco had great chemistry on screen and that really made the movie. For all the fans of the Judd Apatow, this is a must see.",10,3,9,6 August 2008
The Wedding Singer," Classic Sandler
","The Wedding Singer is a 1998 Comedy written by Tim Herlihy, which stars Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore. First of all at this time, Sandler was just getting well known with the movie industry. If he wasn't already, then this movie definitely cemented Sandler as one of the best comedy actors that there is. This movie is definitely worth the time for all of the Adam Sandler fans out there. This movie will make you laugh, but it also carries some heart behind it. You also see a small cameo from Billy Idol in the end. But anyway if you really want to see Sandler at his best, then see this movie entitled The Wedding Singer, because trust me this is a definite classic as far as Adam Sandler movies go.",10,0,1,11 August 2008
Dodgeball," Starts off slow, but the laughs keep coming and coming consistently
","When I first saw the movie Dodgeball I thought that the story was starting out kind of slow and that the dialog was kind of corny in the earlier scenes. But once the movie picked up and began to turn the story into what it was I began to laugh consistently throughout the entire movie. This movie really is a reliable movie that will keep the laughs flowing throughout the 90 minutes. Ben Stiller performs in a very hilarious form as the fitness powered mega gym owner White Goodman. I really recommend that anybody that is a fan of Ben Stiller and his goofy antics at times, then go rent or somehow see this now. You will not be let down.",8,1,2,31 October 2008
Evil Dead II," One of the Greatest Horror Movies to Watch
","Evil Dead II was an original concept with probably one of the greatest B list icons of all time starring, Bruce Campbell. This movies has the makings of one of the greatest horror movies ever made. The first Evil Dead was over the top just straight horror, this however was the first crack at incorporating comedy and humor into the series. You will see more of it in Army of Darkness. Now this honestly was not out to impress and did not star big name celebrities, but it was probably one of the most well done horror movies that I have ever had the privilege to view.10/10",10,3,4,22 June 2009
