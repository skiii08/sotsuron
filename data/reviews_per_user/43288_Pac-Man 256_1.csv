The Blair Witch Project," Okay Movie - I liked it
","The Blair Witch Project was an okay movie. I preffered it on DVD to the movie theatre, because the shaking was less apparant. But in both it was an intresting movie - I'm a young aspring movie producer/directer which is probably the only reason I liked this movie. So I'd give it a 'B' Only because it was a college project movie and it inspired me.",4,0,1,18 January 2000
