E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," best movie in existence...ever!!!!
","This is seriously the best movie I have ever seen to this date. It has a great story line, characters and setting. In addition the movie sends out a great message. For one, that humans are truly just animals, barbaric, insensitive and ignorant creatures! e.t. melts my heart as he loves the plants and wildlife. I love that alien! Drew Barrymore is so cute and relatable if you have a bratty little sister. The main character was such a great actor with much talent. Interacting with a make believe alien must be difficult seeing as how he is not really moving or reacting himself. Anyhow, if you don't believe that its the best movie then you obviously haven't seen it.",10,1,3,1 March 2014
