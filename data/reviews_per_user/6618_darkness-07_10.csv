Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Generally poor acting, but good from places
","Although an extremely annoying performance from young Anakin and Jar Jar, Neeson plays the fatherly role well, to both Anakin and Obi-wan, and Maul is possibly the best villain of all-time (not just because of the double- bladed lightsaber!).Although this isn't as good as the original trilogy, it is still a good action flick and is still entertainingIt is a shame that Maul had to separate Qui-gon and Obi-wan to beat them. He was doing fine against them both at the same time!Fun fact: Richard Armitage was an Naboo fighter in this, as an extra! I haven't found out what part he plays in the movie (I think his part may have got cut), but it is amazing to see how an actor progresses from an extra in a big movie to being the big star in his different big films (the hobbits)Overall? Worth watching once at least",7,0,1,12 November 2013
This Is the End," Didn't make me laugh once
","You know it is an awful comedy when it doesn't make you laugh at all. I think the best bit was James Franco's 'ascension', and even that only made me crack a smile. Emma Watson's role in it is so minor, surprised she was actually credited (probably only credited to say 'we have Emma Watson in this movie'. Similarly with Channing Tatum. I didn't even know Rihanna was in it until I checked on here. If they had used Channing Tatum for more than 5 seconds this film may have actually been funny. Massive let down, with all those big names. Wasted 2 hours of my life, don't make the same mistake. Avoid this film, and if you do watch it be prepared to be disappointed",1,5,10,19 March 2014
The Prestige," A masterpiece!
","An absolutely brilliant film, one of my favorites! Keeps you thinking. Definitely one for those that liked Inception Bale's performance in this is brilliant, one of his best I feel (Perhaps only beaten by his performance in American Psycho). Jackman is also brilliant, and Caine of course great as usual :) My only disappointment is that I didn't see this before!!! Nolan did brilliantly with keeping the audience on edge and keeping them thinking. More twists and turns than... a twisty thing.A word of warning: you may have to watch it more than once to understand it all! I also advise you watch with subtitles, especially for the quieter bits",10,0,1,12 November 2013
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Entertaining action film
","Following Star Wars 1, Anakin is played by a different actor, but is still ridiculously annoying!However, that aside, there are good bits that are very entertaining: I found Mace Windu (Samuel Jackson) to be brilliant in the film (his purple lightsaber was a personal request of Jackson's so he could find himself in the large battle, and because purple is his favorite color), and Christopher Lee played yet another brilliant 'baddie' (loved him in LOTR as well, shame they cut his scene in RotK). The lightsaber battles in the prequel trilogy were much more entertaining to me than the ones in the original trilogy (although VaderVSLuke is still my fav!)I said the same with Phantom Menace: worth watching at least once",8,5,8,12 November 2013
American Psycho," Wild, crazy, epic
","Bale's best performance ever!Goes from crazy to funny to freaky to damn right hilarious. Best dark comedy there is out there.I am not normally one to watch horrors, and generally don't watch them. This one caught my eye however and I definitely don't regret watching it.The special effects are in places poor (chainsaw, you will know what I mean when it gets to it), and I would agree that Willem Dafoe wasn't in it as much as he perhaps should have been, but still an absolutely brilliant film! (Although not one to watch 'with-the-family'!)",9,0,0,12 November 2013
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Brett Ratner's damage has been undone
","Like others have said, I think everyone is struggling to find something wrong with the film. With the future being changed, it also changed the past. Jean Grey returns, and she never killed Scott, was killed by Wolverine. Any of the damage Brett Ratner caused in Last Stand seems to have gone after this.Quicksilver was hilarious (but slightly annoying), and Blink's teleport portals were really cool, and I particularly liked the slingshot of Colossus in a Portal style.I was disappointed not to see more than the one scene (showed most of it in the end credit scene of Captain America: The Winter Soldier) of Havoc (Alex Summers). I don't know why Anna Pacquin was in the credits, she had a 5 second non-speaking role at the very end of the film, mainly just to show she was alive. Also some people in the cinema were asking how Xavier was alive. It is explained in the comics, and we know it happens in the film because of the end credit scene in Last Stand, but it is never explained in this film, which I was surprised by. Plus, I did notice when James McAvoy's Xavier was looking into Wolverine's mind, it would swap from 1 finger on Wolverine's temple to two between shots. Happened multiple times. But again, this is all nitpicking.Absolutely brilliant film, really enjoyable to watch.What we are left questioning? What the hell was that end credit scene? Where will they go from here? Something that bothered me from the trailer: if Xavier transferred himself into his brain dead twin brother's body, why was he still in a wheelchair if his brother never got shot on the beach like he did?",10,0,1,23 May 2014
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Peter Jackson loves carrots
","^Title = Another cameo appearance from Peter Jackson playing the same man he did in LOTR 1, eating a carrot!The film itself was brilliant. Can't wait for the next one!! (Especially after the cliffhanger ending!) A brilliant way to end the film!Bombur's barrel activities got a lot of laughs in the cinema, and I particularly enjoyed Legolas Orc-surfing and owning more orcs.My only disappointment is that the tenseness you feel when you don't know whats going to happen was not there. Bilbo dropping the ring, Gandalf facing Sauron the Necromancer... We all know that Bilbo doesn't lose the ring and that Gandalf survives because of the Lord of the Rings. This was my only disappointment. I find films best when you watch them the first time and don't know whats going to happen.Overall a brilliant film and cannot wait for the finale!",10,4,14,17 December 2013
Non-Stop," Best since Taken
","Went yesterday and really enjoyed it, as did my brother. If you haven't seen the trailer already, I suggest you don't watch it. I feel it gave too much away with the plot twist: you will know what I mean after you have watched the film Lots of plot twists (there is only 1 major one in the trailer). Really kept me thinking 'Who is it?'. And it was interesting to see a struggling Neeson (as in alcohol and breaking the rules despite being the air marshal!). As others have said, there are a few plot holes, but the main and important thing is that the film was really enjoyable. Neeson's best since Taken. If you liked Taken you will like this, along with the other Neeson films (although not as good as this or Taken) For those saying it was Anti-American (one saying all Muslims are terrorists), seriously you are blinded by news coverage and stereotypes. The majority of Muslims, sorry for my extreme generalizing, but 'black people' in general are not terrorists. Yes, the terrorists we hear about on the news do are often black or foreign-to-the-US, but that doesn't mean every single person who is black or foreign is a terrorist. Perhaps the reason they didn't make the terrorists black was to avoid offense and stereotyping terrorists. Maybe this is just a film made for ENTERTAINMENT not a political message. The doctor who was giving help throughout the film was originally a suspect of Neeson's, but after questioning him, seeing his phone and him being a doctor meant that Neeson trusted him. Plus Neeson needed his help as being one of the perhaps only doctors on the plane. Plot holes: yes there were a few things overlooked but it is still a very enjoyable film and that should be what matters, not little things that make no difference (like the temperature as someone said in a different review)",10,1,4,7 March 2014
Taken," Neeson is a Bad-A!!
","An absolutely brilliant film! A really enjoyable film, one of my favourites! Made me see Oskar Schindler in a different light! For those that enjoyed this: Taken 2 is a good sequel, but not as good as this one (as many sequels aren't). Neeson has also released other action films and more of him being a BadALiam Neeson is obviously the main star in this film, and this has been the stepping stone for him to being cast in other action films. His performance in Batman Begins in 2005 was good, and I was disappointed that it didn't shoot off his action-film career, but I am glad this has! Can't wait to see his film coming out in February (Non-stop) nor see what humor role he has in Anchorman 2 (has anyone else seen that Ricky Gervais video??)Couldn't ask for a more action-packed-thrill-ride-more-bada film. One of the best out there!",10,6,9,12 November 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," Hardy a brilliant villain to follow up the Joker
","With many sequels, when the first film is brilliant, the director and cast try and duplicate that, or even try and make something better. Most of the time this is impossible to do, and they fail to make a film that everyone is expecting to be better.If it were not for the ending, this would not have been the caseI loved the whole film and it is another masterpiece from Nolan. However, I was disappointed with the fact that once you realize who Miranda Tate is, it changes the story and makes it seem like her plan, not Bane's. And it turns it into a bit of a love story.If it weren't for the twist to make it 'Miranda's' plan, I would be giving this a 10. It is a brilliant sequel, especially one that had so much expectation, and for me it met that expectation. Definitely one to watch!",9,5,8,12 November 2013
