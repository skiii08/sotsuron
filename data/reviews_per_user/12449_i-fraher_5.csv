Casablanca," review
","This movie was really good. The whole look of the film was awesome. The movies shot in black and white and with the lighting in the movie, it gives an awesome looking image. When I first saw this movie i thought it was going to be just a love story and i wasn't to interested but it ended up being way more interesting. The characters i thought were really good as well. The movie stars Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman and was shot in (1942) and is directed by Michael Curtis. Its its 102 minutes long and is rated Pg. I highly recommend this film. Real good movie. The way the film looks is really cool, it doesn't look like other black and white movies either. Its different.",8,0,1,23 October 2015
Annie Hall," Annie Hall review
","Annie Hall was a solid movie. I just saw it for the first time the other day after I heard about it before and it had struck my interest. I thought the movie was pretty funny. Woody allen had me laughing with the things he says and how he says things. He's negative, sarcastic, and kind of a smart ass, but man does he get me laughing. I don't think its meant to be super hilarious but i found his character pretty funny to watch throughout the movie. The picture of the movie looked phenomena,l when i saw it i kept forgetting how long ago the movie came out. I wasn't even close to being born yet. I've always heard about this movie but i had really no idea or care until recently when i heard about it in class. A few people told me it wasn't good but i thought it was a pretty damn good movie. Diane Keaton is in it as well and she's solid as usual. I think she's one of the best actresses. The movie won academy awards for best picture, best director, best screen play, and best actress for Diane Keaton. I don't know how you can't like this movie but everyone is entitled to their own opinion. its a good movie to watch no doubt",7,1,2,18 December 2015
Singin' in the Rain," Singin' in the Rain review
","I'll say it. I do not like musicals. Ever since i was little i always found them hard to sit through and watch. Its not that i don't like music because i like music of all sorts from any decade or genre but everything about musicals i cannot stand. The acting in this one ill be honest wasn't too bad and some things made me laugh a bit but i can't help but find myself a little annoyed while watching this movie. This is just my opinion though because a lot of people think this was a good movie, they're not wrong i just did not like it. But that doesn't mean i didn't think it was a good movie (if that makes any sense.) Like while i was watching i didn't like it but i could still see why people like it. There was just so much damn dancing in this movie and singing and besides the 3 main characters i found most of the cast annoying or boring to watch. But again, this is just my opinion.",4,3,6,17 December 2015
Pulp Fiction," Pulp Fictton review
","This movie is amazing. I love Tarantino. I love violence. I love this movie. This movie is so freaking good that i could talk about it for hours. It was not the first Tarantino movie i saw, nor the 2nd,3rd, or 4th but it should have been. I now know why this movie is so well known. The cinematography is awesome and the whole look of the film in general is an experience to see. The really cool thing about this movie is that its shot out of chronological order. The scenes are completely all over the place. They do not go in order. Its different and could confuse you but i was still able to pick up on the movie and what was going on because all though none of the scenes were shot in order they all connect to each other a little bit in a way. I think that the way its shot out of chronological order makes the movie awesome and unique. I've seen a number of movies shot out of chronological order but this one is the best in my opinion. Im not lying when i say everything about this movie is a freaking trip! Its got an insanely good cast starring in it and it has a lot of violence. Love this movie. Tarantino never disappoints me.",10,3,6,18 December 2015
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest review
","This movie was amazing. I was very into this flick. Jack Nicholson is phenomenal and the supporting cast is top notch! The story is very very dark, but the movie has its funny parts. Some scenes actually had me laughing pretty hard. I don't think mental illness is a laughing matter what so ever but there were a few pretty funny scenes. This movie won best actor, best actress, best director, and best picture. I have not seen many movies from 1975, but i can definitely see why this movie walked away from the academy awards that year like a champ. Everything about the film just wowed me. Especially the acting. The patients were great supporting actors and they were so good at making me believe they were mentally ill. it has both Christopher Lloyd and a much younger looking Danny Devito. I didn't even recognize Devito at first. Lloyd was hilarious. To me i found this movie kind of scary. To me, movies like this are more scary to me than a modern horror movie. Let me just say that this is a perfect example why i do not like hospitals. It does not take place in a hospital, it takes place in a looney bin but i see hospitals as the same way when I'm staying in them, this institution in the movie though is so messed up it makes me cringe in certain scenes. Those scenes terrify me. The movie was great and I highly recommend it to everyone. I do not see how someone could not like this movie. I was obsessed with the whole movie after i saw it for the first time.",9,1,2,18 December 2015
