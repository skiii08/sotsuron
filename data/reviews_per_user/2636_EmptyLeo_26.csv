Antz," Who is that?
","I watched this with my sister tonight on pay-per-view. All we knew about it was that it was a computer animated movie about ants, or something. We came in to the 5 minutes late because the Pizza man didn't get here fast enough, so we missed the opening credits. We had no idea who the voices were. Woody Allen and Stallone were easy to figure out. We had fun trying to figure out the rest of them. She beat me on Sharon Stone and Danny Glover while I guessed Anne Bancroft & Christopher Walken fairly early. The one we couldn't figure out was Mandible. I was stuck on Tommy Lee Jones, though I knew it wasn't him. It took us 'til 15 minutes to the movie's end for me to figure it out: 'HACKMAN!'  I beat her to it and that's all I care about. Now I'll have to watch the movie again to see what it's about!",Null,0,0,2 May 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," As good as the others
","A lot of jokes on Letterman about how this movie supposedly bombed, so I was expecting a bit of a letdown, but my cousin said it kicked ass and my expectations changed. I went in looking forward to seeing a great movie, and was NOT let down.I had no idea what this thing was going to be about. I didn't watch what little previews there was, never sought the trailer on this net. Hell, I didn't even watch McDonald's/Pizza Hut/Taco Bell commercials. All I knew going in was that my cousin said it kicked ass. A couple of things really surprised me; r2d2 and c3po! no way!Not only were the effects awesome (the underwater world was amazing, where 'There's always a bigger fish.', The Pod race was great. The androids being deployed for the battle on whatever planet it was, wow!)There was some great acting too. Natalie Portman is just awesome in this, as she is in everything she does (Leon, Beautiful Girls.) I'm not a big Liam Neeson fan, couldn't stand him in Nell, but I liked him here. (What's with the British, Scottish and Irish Jedis? Oh, okay Ewan McGregor is the same character as Alec Guinness, nevermind.) The kid who played Anakin was good too.I'm glad the majority of people here saw what I saw and this thing has an 8.0 rating, though I gave it a 10",10,0,0,17 June 1999
Raiders of the Lost Ark," 10
","I remember seeing this at the theatre. I couldn't wait for it, I knew it'd be a good movie, as Han Solo was the star! and I wasn't disappointed. My favorite scenes were the one mentioned in the original comment for this movie, where Indy watches this sabre-wielding badman show off for 2 minutes then takes his gun and shoots him, as if swatting a fly. Also the snakepit. Was cool to know Indy had a vulnerability, he was afraid of snakes, and here were ten of every kind. At Universal Studios I was told that if you look close enough at the cobra you can see Harrison Ford's reflection on the glass that separates him from the snake. But every time I get to that scene I'm so into the movie I forget about it. Love this movie, a 10",10,0,1,30 March 2000
Casablanca," I don't get it.
","I'll never understand why Humphrey Bogart was/is so popular.  The only movie I can say I liked of his was The Desperate Hours, but that's not because he was in it. That was just a good movie.  Casablanca didn't do anything for me. I found it hard to sit through.  Something wrong with me I guess, I've watched it more than a couple of times to try to figure out its popularity.I can only give it a 5.",7,1,7,6 September 1999
Citizen Kane," maybe had I seen it in 1941..
","Citizen Kane ------------ This was #1 on AFI's Top 100, and it was one of only two in their top 10 I hadn't seen. (Still haven't seen Gone With the Wind.) So I rented this one. I guess the big deal wasn't so much the story, which was a good one, but all the camera angles and lighting or whatever that Orson Welles. Well, I don't care about any of that. I just want a good story and good acting. There was plenty of that here. I knew Rosebud was the mystery going in so I kept my eyes open. I kept my eyes open and figured it out. Lucky guess, or it may have been because I'd seen it in crossword puzzles and never knew what it meant.. You know where the clue is: Like Rosebud, and the answer is 5 letters: asled. Pretty good movie, not worthy of #1 if you ask me. I give it a solid 7",7,0,1,7 September 1999
Alien: Resurrection," my 4th favorite Alien film
","I liked this one less than the Alien3 movie, but that doesn't mean I didn't like it. Winona Ryder was good, Sigourney Weaver, these are the only films of hers I can stand to watch. Not because she's a bad actress, but all I can think is, 'she's Ripley from Alien'. Like Linda Hamilton and the Terminator series. Anyway, I liked the whole cast and yeah Winona, didn't expect to like her in a sci-fi horror movie, though I am a fan of hers, but she was good.Though I said it was my 4th favorite of the Alien series, I still give it a 6 out of 10. Still better than most movies in this genre.",6,0,0,8 April 1999
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Kubrick: The man wasn't 100% all there!
","Had no clue going in what this movie was about really. I didn't know if it was okay that I was laughing at some of the scenes. All the men sitting around the table trying to figure out how to stop this plane from dropping a bomb, was like a bunch of kids in detention, Breakfast Club-like. Sellers's Strangelove undoes in two minutes of talking what the whole rest of the gang is trying to do for the first 90 minutes of this movie, and actually gets the other men smiling, hey BOMBS AWAY!",8,0,1,27 March 2000
Rocky II," My favorite Rocky film
","This is by far my favorite of all the Rocky movies. Clarence Weathers gave a great performance that gets better as the time goes by (Apollo Creed could be any of today's heavyweight boxers, as the mouths do run). I also thought the fight was the best choreographed since Raging Bull.",8,1,1,13 March 1999
The Godfather: Part II," Better than the first? I dunno
","I loved Marlon Brando but Al Pacino stepped into the role pretty good. The De Niro flashbacks, it's all good. I don't know which movie is better.I loved when AFI's top 100 was on and one producer was saying how much he cursed Francis Ford Coppola because he had trouble listing his top 5 all-time films and dammit Coppola, you gave me 2 of them!10/10 for Part II",9,0,0,19 August 1999
Lawrence of Arabia," Beautiful scenery...
","And that's about all I can say about this movie. I only watched 2 hours of it, had no desire to finish it. I was not drawn to the story at all. Nothing compelled me to give a damn about this Lawrence fellow.3/10",4,8,30,19 August 1999
Schindler's List," Captivating and at times, boring.
","Only watched it the once, if i see it again maybe I'll understand more as to why this was 3 hours plus. See things I missed. There were times when I wondered, 'What the hell is this scene doing here?' But for the most part I had eyes wide, it was just a beautiful movie. The black and white was a wonderful idea. Great cinematography. Ralph Fiennes, Ben Kingsley and Liam Neeson (Whom I am not a big fan, hated him in The Phantom Menace, Ethan Frome and Nell) Great music by John Williams and Steven Spielberg keeps getting better and better, as if it were thought possible.8/10",8,1,3,28 July 1999
Casualties of War," Not bad
","It's not 'Platoon', my favorite war movie (I haven't seen Saving Private Ryan yet) but I was surprised how good it was, Michael J Fox's best performance by far. Sean Penn was kind of dry but the supporting cast was great, Lequizamo & Rhames, etc.7/10 from me",7,0,2,17 April 1999
Event Horizon," Blah.
","Not a terrible movie, but with that cast it shouldn't have been. Comparable to 'Sphere', but the acting not as good. I couldn't stay with it. 5 out of 10, 'Sphere' got a 6 from me.",5,1,2,6 April 1999
From Dusk Till Dawn," This movie was stupid.. I loved it!
","You had to know going in what a silly movie this was, but it was a lot of fun to watch. Bad guy mass murdering brothers, good guy hostages and a bunch of vampires, I didn't know who to root for. Clooney was good, Tarantino was Tarantino. Michael Parks and Cheech Marin were both funny in smaller roles. I didn't like Harvey Keitel so much, not in this movie.7 out of 10 from me, which seems to be the average.",6,0,0,6 April 1999
It's a Wonderful Life," it IS as good as they said.
","I kept putting this movie off, every year cursing it for being on the TV, didn't watch it front to back til this past Christmas. I'd seen bits and pieces of it and thought it pretty predictable, but to watch the whole thing....it really made me think. I'm glad I finally watched it.9 out of 10",9,0,3,8 April 1999
Psycho," Wish I could've seen this in '60
","I hate that I knew about the shower scene before I ever saw the movie. I hate that I went in thinking it's a movie about Anthony Perkins/Norman Bates instead of Janet Leigh/Marion Crane. But even knowing what I did when I first saw it didn't take away too much from this masterpiece. Norman Bates, ever the victim, cleaning up after his mother's misdeeds. What great acting by Perkins. His delivery of such lines as 'We all go a little mad sometimes... Haven't you?' with the chuckle in the middle. The look on his face when that car wasn't going to sink all the way. The way Arbogast had him flustered and his mother almost came out, 'I'm not a fool and I'm not capable of being fooled... Maybe she fooled me but she didn't fool my mother!' What a great line that was anyway.Someone suggested that Vince Vaughan did a better job in the '98 version of Psycho. Oh no. No no no no no. In the original you really believe Norman Bates is an innocent victim. You're really kind of hoping he'll pull it off. No way he could've killed the girl. Vince Vaughan himself looks like a murderer.This movie gets a big fat 10 from me.",10,1,3,21 August 1999
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," I love Nicholson
","Jack Nicholson may just be my favorite actor out there. I'll watch a movie just because he's in it. Which is the only reason I watched this one. I love crazy people movies though, and this one got an 8 out of 10 from me.",8,2,8,21 July 1999
The Shawshank Redemption," Stephen King ain't just a horror novelist
","From the same book that brought us Stand By Me and Apt Pupil comes The Shawshank Redemption. If you haven't read this book (Different Seasons), you'd better go buy it. And if you haven't seen Apt Pupil (very underrated movie) go rent it.A couple things about this movie. Morgan Freeman is one of the best out there. When I read the novella, 'Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption' I had never thought that Red was a black man. Maybe he wasn't which just goes to show what a great story and movie this was. IT DIDN'T and IT DOESN'T MATTER that he's black or not. The other thing was that I kind of wish I HADN'T read the story first. Knowing how it was going to end spoiled it a little, not too much because the girl I saw it with was 100% totally surprised when the hole in the wall was discovered. So at least I had that prior knowledge over her. haha!Even though I gave this movie a 10 out of 10 here at IMDb, I'm surprised it's doing battle with The Godfather and Schindler's List for the #1 position here.",10,1,1,19 August 1999
Raging Bull," Great fighting!
","Just the fight scenes alone make this great! I was just saying how much I loved Rocky II and that it was the best except for Raging Bull in the choreography department. What makes the Raging Bull scenes much better is that they're based on real fights. Like HBO's Tyson movie that just came out, but this one is the best. I really wanted De Niro to go down, so he'd stop getting beat! Please, just go down!The rest of the movie was pretty good too, sad ending. Cathy Moriarty was excellent. 8 out of 10",8,1,2,7 April 1999
The Sixth Sense," Who'd've thought?
","I don't recall my jaw dropping like it did during the conclusion of this movie since... Dirty Mary Crazy Larry.For the first 100 minutes Haley Joel Osment carried this movie and Bruce Willis was just along for the ride. But still I was thinking, 'I'm really disappointed. How can this thing have the 8.9 rating on IMDb?' Then I saw the last 6 minutes...I gotsta give this movie a 9",10,0,0,19 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Love it.
","I think I was 4 or 5 when this came out. My whole family, Mom, Dad, Sister, Brother and I, went to see this at a Drive-In. I don't think I blinked for 2 hours. And that's where it all began. I don't need to go into how much of a freak I was about Star Wars, but I will say I was Yoda one year for Halloween and Darth Vader for the next 3 years. The Empire Strikes Back is almost as good if not better, but if you have to pick one you go with Star Wars, Episode IV: A New Hope, this one here, a 10/10",10,0,0,21 July 1999
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," my favorite of the trilogy also
","i especially liked how the movie split to two separate stories and how everything came together for the good in the end, re-emphasizing the strength of this FORCE.not gonna say anything everyone's already said10/10",10,0,0,21 July 1999
The Breakfast Club," One of my top 10 all-time favorites
","I loved this movie so much.. I made a New Year's resolution one year to watch it every day. I only made it to January 12th, so now if I'm watching the movie with someone they have to tell me to shut up since I know all the lines!This movie captured my generation superbly. I had at least one of each character in my high school, except the uppity principal. A lot of great dialogue in this movie and each actor played their part perfect, except for Estevez.All of the characters in their own clique. All of them with one common enemy: adults.Most teenagers dislike their parents for this reason or that and fear they will become like their parents. 'It's inevitable' says Ally Sheedy's Allison. I think she's right. Scary, huh?10/10 is my rating",10,0,1,2 June 1999
Jurassic Park," 6/10
","I thought this would be a cool movie about dinosaurs living in the present day. A family type picture. I wasn't expecting a dinosaurs are the bad guys, 'oh no they're going to kill us' type thing. Then when it turned into that kind of movie I just kind of had to root for the dinosaurs. Well no, didn't want the kids to die, but then the ending irked me too. It was like, 'Oh no they're after us...' and then everything was okay. The end.Still I gotsta say, cool effects. 6 out of 10",7,0,4,26 September 1999
Evil Dead II," I laughed, I cried, I peed my pants...
","Oh man did we ever wear out the rewind button watching this movie! 'did we just see what we think we just saw?' I never had to stop a movie because I couldn't stop laughing until EDII! We watched it about 5 times the night we rented it, but if you count in all the rewinding, we watched this movie for about 8 hours straight... ..a 10 out of 10..'Groovy!'",10,0,0,4 April 1999
The Godfather," I finally saw the whole thing! Great movie!
","It took me a while to get this movie watched from beginning to end, as it seems I would always catch it a half hour or so in. I'd never want to watch a movie that's supposed to be as great as this after missing the first Â½ hour. Then there were the times I'd catch it on HBO, TMC or Showtime late at night and fall asleep (admit it, it does get off to a slow star). Finally i stole my brother's set of all three Godfather movies and watched front to back. Damn good cast. I liked Marlon Brando a lot and Al Pacino is already one of my favorite actors ('Scarface' I still like better than Godfather). Then you got your James Caan and Robert Duvall was at his best.Cool story about family and gangster life, loved the horse's head.9/10",9,0,1,19 August 1999
