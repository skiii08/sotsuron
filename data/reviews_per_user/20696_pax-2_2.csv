Antz," Amazing Animation, and a story adults will love
","Antz has to be one of the best Animated movies I have ever seen, The computer animation is fantastic and the satire in the story will keep you laughing all the way through the movie.I have to admit I don't much like Woody Allen's movies, but he is great as the worker ant Z in this movie.
