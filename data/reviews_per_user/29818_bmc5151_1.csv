First Man," Zzzzzzzzz....
","You have to hand it to everyone involved in this film, particularly Chazelle and Gosling. They took one of the most momentous and important events in human history and turned it into a boring, lifeless snoozefest. That could hardly have been easy to do. Gosling, who has all the charisma of a dead cat, played Neil Armstrong to be practically a zombie. Yes we know Armstrong was a humble, low-key man of few words, but I do believe he was alive. We also know that his dead daughter was always in his thoughts, and that was the reason for much of the morose, lifeless way he carried himself. The dropping of her necklace was a fairly well-done scene (symbolism of letting go and all that), although somewhat contrived. The guy who played Armstrong in a couple of brief scenes in Apollo 13 was much better. It is also common knowledge that there were 2 other astronauts on Apollo 11, namely Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins, but you wouldn't know it from this film.
Ah well, so depressed at how depressing this film was. Want to watch an entertaining and informative look at Apollo 11? Skip this and check out any one of the various historical specials that are constantly being run these days on the various cable channels.",3,3,4,22 July 2019
