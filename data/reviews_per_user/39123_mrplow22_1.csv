Requiem for a Dream," DRUGS ARE BAD!!!
","I just finished watching this movie, and it was one of the best movies I have ever seen.  It is intense, thought provoking, and mind boggling. They should show this movie in every health class around the country.  Kids will get the picture that drugs do ruin your life.  It shows so many aspects of the drug world: crack, abusive nature of prescription pills, and selling yourself for drugs.  I would strongly recommend this for anyone out there. The angles of the camera, the music, and the characters bring this movie to life.  The suspense of knowing what is going to happen next is also one of the best parts of watching the movie.  Go and see this movie.",10,0,1,22 March 2004
