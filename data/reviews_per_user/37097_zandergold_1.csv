Alien 3," Dark, brooding movie.
","I really enjoyed this move; it exemplified everything that an Alien movie should be composed be; fear, confusion and death, with the underlying threat of the bitch itself. The very fact that Newt and Hicks are bumped off at the beginning is the gun-blast to the race; it shows immediately that Fincher isn't afraid to 'take out' characters, unlike most other action/thrill/horror films. This film took the genre back to its roots; Aliens was a gung-ho splash, and strayed too far from the ideology and concept that Alien stands for; being hunted with no sanctuary. Insanity is another medium that Fincher expressed; whether it be the wails of the manic-depressive Golic or Dillion's Christian Fundmanetalist brew, the composition of the characters is rich and diverse. Weaver is excellent as the tired Ripley, who has been pushed so far by the menace she no longer cares for her life. And the prisoners - you actually feel sorry for the (pretty nasty) skinheads when they get picked off, one by one. Esepcially when they dedicate themselves to destroy the Alien. The gradual deterioration from order to brutal anarchy is both subtle and hideous, and can be compared to a futuristic Lord of the Flies. You, the viewer, is fully aware that the system will collapse under the Alien, and can only watch as the inmates suffer blow after deadly blow.And the ending; what an ending! The very fact that Morse is the only survivor shows just how unpredictable this film is; I don't know about you, but I expected '85, Dillion and Ripley to survive. And thats why I love this move; it defies stereotypical hero survival. The very fact the prisoners team up to kill the 'dragon' at the expense of their own lives is symbolic of human courage that exists within everyone, that co-operation is the only thing that can redeem mankind.Overall, this film is dark, brooding and thoroughly fulfilling. The chase scenes in the lead-works are worthy of a mention of themselves; a mix between adrenaline and hysteria as we see the raw fear of the hunted Convicts. People don't like the third installment because they do not appreciate that this film is a dark portrayal of human nature and must be seen with an open-mind rather than bitter comparison to the other movies. Alien 3 is a triumph in all aspects.",10,22,28,31 January 2005
