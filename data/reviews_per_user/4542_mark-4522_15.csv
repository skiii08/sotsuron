Blade Runner 2049," We should have flying cars by now
","Spoiler alert, but I think my review will enhance your experience.I enjoyed much of the film due to little easter eggs such as the actress who plays Cameron in the 80's retro series 'Halt and Catch Fire' is a prostitute in a sequel to a film based upon an alternate reality from the 1980's. Irony wrapped in an onion And note: This is an ALTERNATE universe from the original film that had expected the USSR to still be around and for us to have flying cars by 2010 or so. The director wants us to note this by showing Pan Am advertisements and other retired 1980's brands (Braniff perhaps? Keep a lookout!) The style is similar to that of the original film so if you liked the original film, you'll feel comfortable and in a way, I liked that. Look for appearances from (aged) original cast members from the original film aside from Harrison Ford. The plot rolls along almost exactly like it's predecessor. It's almost as if it was written and conceived a year or so afterwards and put on hold for 34 moreThe original film's notion of replicants was not entirely believable but in the introduction text for this one, the story is preposterous: The Nexus series replicants were so dangerous that it caused a civil war resulting in a ban but later lifted when they were made 'safe' (similar to Asimov's three laws) and the human bigotry towards 'skin jobs' continues even as many humans still live in absolute poverty (including an orphanage utilizing humans as slave labor) and a replicant working as a police officer. Now think about it: If replicants are now operating on Earth because they're so safe, what need is there for human slaves or poverty? And the replicants are apparently not safe since they require continual imprecise oral 'base checks' where the replicants now often exercise free will and kill and attack living people. Asimov is spinning in his grave. 'This is not how ANY of this works!!!' he would be saying.And all of this robotic technology that is just a hair's span away from killing all of humanity overnight is in the hands of a weird Tyrell replacement whose blind, insane and evil and sends out robot minions to beat up people to get what he wants. He apparently thinks that his manufacturing process isn't efficient enough and needs a way to get robots made the, er, old fashioned way.This does spur a philosophical insight on my part in that even as our society becomes more efficient at manufacturing and information retrieval, the world's elite cries out for more labor even as they engage in massive layoffs at their companies to have a lean workforce. So while the raw message of the film is a bit silly, it can spur insights (at least with me).Finally, while bladerunner original had many fun, technological devices such as a scanner that could take a photo print and examine it in HD, this film has nothing new that would surprise us. That' s OK because it's a continuation of a film conceived in the mid-80's and helps to keep the style consistent. I wish this had been done with Star Wars. I'm reminded of a sequel to the Fifth Element, one of my favorite films, that was just awful (I wrote a review on that) and this is better at least. These sequels and remarks only serve to remind us of how GOOD the 80's films were (and still are).",6,5,10,17 October 2017
Gravity," Overrated and an embarrassment
","Let's start with why it's overrated. The plot is boring. Yes, boring. A space action movie that's boring with is an accomplishment, kind of. This is happening a lot with Hollywood where writers are paid a thousand bucks to write a script and a billion dollars on special effects. Compare and contrast to the tense and gripping scifi film 'Moon'. Or 'Dark Star'. But if those aren't mainstream enough, consider Planet of the Apes (original) made on a shoestring budget. You can make a great scifi film without a lot of money.Next, the acting. Big stars in big, empty roles. Their pedigrees actually made me ask why the film is so boring. Like the astronauts, they gasped for air to be interesting in stereotypical roles and failed. Consider great scifi movies with nameless talent at the time: Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, and a villain you never even get to see his face and robots. Next, the embarrassment part: The India mars mission cost less than the film, something they are proud of. The USA space program had a greater day and now Hollywood spends similar money to make sub-par films that used to put men on the moon. Shameful. Disgusting. Finally, I suppose the biggest problem with the film is that the space station itself is boring much like a bus station in space. Aging Soviet rockets take astronauts and cosmonauts to 70's era style cans to monitor experiments and then back down to Earth. Nothing groundbreaking. When was the last time you watched space station footage with excitement? Since the real thing is boring, how to make an improbable real life scenario interesting? Lifeforce (space sex vampires on the space shuttle) was more fun (for the love of God, I'm glad Sandra Bullock wasn't cast in that leading role!) Hmm, perhaps something more fun would be a MURDER in space. Perhaps someone dies on the station while everyone is asleep and they try to solve the mystery on the ground. That crazy diaper wearing astronaut could be the inspiration. Hmmm.... I should write that up and register it as a screenplay...",2,3,6,26 August 2014
The Big Lebowski," There are uptight folks out there who don't get it, but they will. Or not.
","For fun, I wondered who would give this film a no star. I find it fascinating that when I see a great film and others see a terrible one, a Battlefield Earth, what causes the discrepancy? Is it perhaps they're humorless or lack the capacity to 'get it?' The investigation was interesting. The reviewers seemed articulate much of the time and not mere trolls. Yet, they hated the Dude. The whole thing. Every character. They were bored. They felt it was stupid.So perhaps here's why a few people can't 'get' the Dude: They just don't like him. They didn't like the characters. The nihilists ordering 'piggie in the blankets' or a Vietnam vet whose converted to Judaism and watches his ex-wife's dog. The film has a wonderful backstory that invites you to fill in the gaps with similar characters in your own life and fiction. It's full of rich details but if you don't like one, or more, of the characters, then it's like listening to colleagues you dislike at work prattle on about their facebook posts. They don't get it and don't care and just want to leave.The genius of the film is that many people who don't see the humor on the first viewing a few years later see it again, perhaps on TV as their spouse or friend is watching it, and realize: 'I missed that the first time around. That's pretty funny and insightful.' Then they watch some more. Then more. Then they're hooked.The Dude is not for the faint of heart. You would NOT want the Dude to move in with you. He'd burn down the house because he forgot to turn off the oven but, hey, stop being so fascist about it will ya? But even if you want some distance between you and him, you come to love him and his troupe of characters that are simultaneously stereotypes, both in fiction and real life, and at the same time unique characters in their own right. The Dude says you need to stop being so uptight, relax, and get it. Or not. And when someone gets uptight and doesn't get it, they don't get it. And they are the ones who write 0 star reviews of this film on IMDb.A few years down the road, they'll have a few drinks in them and relax and watch it and then they'll change. Maybe they'll fix their 0 star IMDb review. Maybe they'll apologize to the Dude but the Dude is OK with that. He has far more important things to do.",10,1,4,11 June 2014
The Fifth Element," Please read before watching DESPITE presence of spoilers
","As a public service, I'm reviewing this film 20 years after watching it. There are some negative reviews of this film that need to be rebutted!At the time this film came out, many didn't 'get it'. It was a sci-fi action romp that seemed to make no sense with ridiculous characters. A villain who has a southern accent. An absurd idea of 4 elements + a fifth stopping a black hole. Over the top costumes and lines. But it was MEANT to be that way. What came across as silly was French and European movie style. Some don't 'get it'. Here's how to understand:In this bright, but dismal world (much like today where you can find beauty mixed in with poverty), there's flying cars, magical machines that make rotisserie chicken out of pellets, makeup applicators you put on your eyes like a sleeping mask, and Chinese food delivered by a guy to your window. Oh, and a cigarette dispenser and a shower that doubles as a refrigerator and closet. It's the journey that was all about fun but it all kind of made sense: Save the world. The characters were perfectly cast for what they did. Yes, Bruce Willis is obviously typecast as a future cabby/ex-cop but that's what he does well. Leeloo/Jovovich is a supermodel with brains who is simultaneously likable and feminine despite the worst hairdoo ever. The action sequences were good for the time and fun and also had a lot of humor. You even can like the villain Zorg with his interesting take on destruction that ought to be part of an economics class. There were hundreds of moving parts including Chris Tucker acting with Willis that shouldn't have worked, but did. There was a lot of room to have fun and for those viewers who wanted to have fun, they did. Some didn't. And that's OK.",Null,0,0,29 August 2017
Tangled," Subtly clever, timeless classic. Will age well.
","Tangled wasn't as big a success as Frozen perhaps because while watchable, it didn't pander to what successful Disney films engage in: Fantasy elitism. Even as the films required some sort of quest for the heroine to achieve (or preferably, a dragon for the hero to slaughter), there's a secret desire for kids to never have to grow up and earn a living. Even in this film, Rapunzel lives a pretty easy life in the tower but there are no parties and friends to marvel at her dresses and singing.What makes this film special is that the villains and heroes, even the rogue, engage in psychology we see in everyday life. The gaslighting performed by the witch should be required viewing for psychology students. The rogue who attempts to dissuade Rapunzel from her quest tries to scare her while it hilariously backfires. It's like the writers were remembering all of their childhoods.That kind of savvy commentary flies over the heads of most kids (and even many adults) but there's plenty of great music, endearing characters, and solid jokes to keep it moving but not perhaps sell as many toys or get girls excited about a life of leisure on a reality show. It's more healthy, but less addictive. The diet-Frosted Flakes of Disney entertainment.",10,0,0,11 May 2020
Oblivion," Logan's Run was better.
","The vast number of plot holes and predictable plot made the film fun in a way. Let's start with the holes. (Spoilers). The alien supercomputer has just two people that it lies to get a job done. So who built the fancy condo that Cruise lives in? Who makes all the stuff that they use? The food? The medical devices? The portable bike? If the supercomputer makes all this stuff, why not just make some kind of drone repairman out of its own repertoire? Next, why suck all the hydrogen out of Earth? Hydrogen is the most common element in the universe. There's plenty on nearby Jupiter that would be trivial to extract. Or even a nebula. Or just collect solar wind.Aside from the superfluous need for the drone repairman and Earth water, let's consider the predictable plot. Earth wins. Yeah! The ending feels good, but hollow calories. Of course we know something is fishy from the beginning of the film based upon the secrecy. After all, what are they hiding that they need their memory wiped? This plot of turning Earthians against their own kind has been explored already in the The Outer Limits. We know he's not going to really take his wife to die. Morgan Freeman already said he wants to be there to help nuke the Tet.Despite all of these flaws, it's good old fashioned space opera like Logan's Run. Well produced. But I think Logan's Run was more fun.",5,2,4,20 January 2014
Burn After Reading," Awful except by wonk standards
","My wife and I had the misfortune to watch this film at Tysons Corner just outside of Washington, DC. The multiplex was filled with Washington Metro area professionals and government wonks. They loved it. I viewed it, and them, as good examples of why the founding fathers started a revolution in the first place.The film was numbingly pompous and smug along with the viewing audience. It begins with a satellite view of DC. 'Wow!', the viewers and directors thought, 'This is what DC looks like from a satellite! We're COOL!' Like they never used google maps before. It went downhill from there (for me at least.) The actors were all A-list but tragically, weren't acting. Or in the case of Brad Pitt, just acted BADLY. He was awful and unconvincing and his accent was so fake (whatever accent he was trying to make, perhaps southern?) that his character appeared mentally retarded. Maybe that's what he was going for but it only appeared to be a mentally retarded actor portraying someone stupid.Malkovich is a splendid actor who, like Eastwood and Schwartzenneggar, used their typecasting to fit into roles that audiences loved to see again and again. The problem with this spy film was that he was so typecast into such a predictable role, he didn't even need to say his lines. They could have been read off by a Malkovich impersonator which is what he seemed to be portraying.And perhaps that's the problem with the film: It was a bunch of actors given too much free rein to rest on their laurels or ad-lib that it made me question if a director was there who cared about the performances or if they just left the actors and cameramen to do as they pleased. It's funny sometimes in comedy where there's a good premise, but this one didn't have it.There was absolutely nothing new here. NOTHING. Big name actors. Check. Spy plot. Check. Cool street scenes to prove it was filmed in DC. Check. Yawn.At least with Battlefield Earth, the awfulness was spontaneous in it's own way. 'Here's a rat for you to eat, Human.' That's FUNNY! The wait in line to pick up the tickets was more suspenseful than this bilge.",1,4,11,9 July 2010
The Man Who Would Be King," What? No Oscar?
","Nominated for 4 Oscars yet winning none it's shocking it didn't get nominated for more. Michael Caine's performance was stunning as a best friend who stays with his comrade no matter what. This is the ultimate of buddy, road-trip films similar to Easy Rider or Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. You're supposed to enjoy the ride even if there's foreshadowing that things don't end right. At the same time, there's a Doctor Zhivago aspect of a grand epic. The scenery is stunning as is the whole scope of the film. In Doctor Zhivago, you know from the beginning how the tale ends and you almost forget it because of 3 hours of grand (although sad) story. In this one, the two hours seem to fly by. The jokes and clever human insights are thrown out, at several levels (both vaudeville as well as more subtle) faster than than you can follow along or laugh. The material is wonderfully unPC by today's standards and consequently, a few (few) reviewers were turned off by it but simultaneously, it was a film of it's times (the 1960's, the late Victorian era, and even the cultures portrayed in the film) that you feel immersed and drawn in. This Is An Epic Film. Like life, sometimes we are too busy having a good time, or not, to stop and smell the roses. You can do that after a 2nd viewing which I guarantee you'll want to have.",10,1,4,28 September 2015
Elysium," Imagine a liberal screenwriter has a nightmare and put it on film
","Whenever a film has obvious political overtones, the plot suffers because the writers and actors develop a kind of emotional and creative rigor mortis. Spoiler alert: I must summarize the plot to explain my position. The draft written up is this: Evil white male elites are so separated from humanity, they must live in a space station. Everyone there is white and evil except for an Indian president. The hero, Matt Damon though, is white (of course) because Hollywood leftists, also white, don't want to view themselves as entirely bad and this film won't sell to ignorant action movie audiences if the hero isn't white. This is probably what was said over the initial screenplay writing table.Jodie Foster needs to be believable as an evil white woman security director but she can't humanize the role (since she has no empathy with it) so it falls flat. Bad acting. She should have taken lessons from Sir Anthony Hopkins who humanized Hannibal. Other apartheid villains are also stereotypical due to limited emotional ability for the actors or writers to see past their ideological blinders. The droids seemed to have more emotion than the bad guys who just couldn't read their horrible lines (as they saw them.) Compare and contrast to Archie Bunker who was portrayed by a leftist. Carol O'Conner humanized a working class bigot into a national icon.It's hilarious that the film is so PC, that the evil guys have to stop 'undocumented' flights from entering their airspace. Why not say 'unauthorized?' They want to make the point: The evil future world is run by Republicans who use leftist terminology! Others have pointed out the numerous plot holes and logical inconsistencies that just don't work. Like a computer program determining whose 'citizens' (sort of Logan's Run there) and also, storing stuff in people's brains? Ever hear of Johnny Mnemonic?(Side observations: The cybernetic implants for Damon and others went over their clothes including bolted in. How do these guys change their underwear? Do they have to painfully bolt out of these outfits?)The actors and writers didn't consider that this future revealed the nihilism of their own politics: After a world becomes overpopulated and the USA's borders are wide open, instead of Swedish paradise for all, the white elite would just go up into space (with an Indian president, of course) and continue to oppress everyone. There is no end to white privilege. Ever. How long would Elysium last as a Malibu paradise after a million shuttles land and make it into East L.A.? Is Jodie Foster opening up HER mansion doors to the great unwashed? (Funny google: I looked it up and she does have an actual mansion and values her 'privacy'. I guess she'll probably reserve her slot on Elysium in advance!)For that reason, and that reason alone, I give this 6 stars. Savor the limousine liberal hypocrisy like a fine wine.",6,1,3,19 December 2016
Jack Reacher," If you like the movie, you'll love the books more
","One of the challenges to adapting a book to a screenplay is that the action descriptions in the book allow detailing how 1 guy can take down 5 others in a street fight. When filmed, the fight may take place in 30 seconds and hits take a half second. In the book, the fight techniques are described in pages of detail.Another challenge is that although the Jack Reacher books are fun, the villains can be a bit James Bond cartoonish. On screen, 'The Zec' appeared forgettable. We ignore this in the book because Reacher's experience is what where the excitement is, but on screen, the script writers should have developed that character more. I cared more for when horny teenagers were knocked off in Friday the 13th than I did for these villains.Next, the chase sequences in the film were more Mission Impossible than the undercover-vagabond that Jack Reacher is. Tom Cruise is known to be a great car driver, but Jack Reacher rarely gets behind the wheel. The charm of Jack Reacher was lost as the film merged with other Tom Cruise, er, vehicles.Which leads us to something others have said here: Casting Cruise as Reacher. Reacher's attractiveness to the ladies stems not from James Bond style and charm, but rather raw muscle and height with him being smarter than he looks.Now that's all the bad news first. The good news is that much of the philosophy of Reacher and his way of thinking was represented in the film, albeit subdued by the action sequences. The story was reasonably well represented. What makes a Reacher novel fun to read is following along with Reacher's mind as he solves the mystery so some of that would be lost in trying to read this novel after seeing the film. But (most) other Reacher novels are of similar quality or better than the source material for this film. So use this film as a gateway to the Jack Reacher universe.",6,0,0,1 June 2020
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Who cares?!?!
","How may ways is TLJ awful? Let's count the ways:For starters, it has three subplots (Rey's training under Skywalker, Finn's attempt to find a codebreaker, and Poe's attempt to save the Rebel fleet). With three sub plots going on at once, it's hard to follow and remain emotionally engaged. By the time you come back to Poe's training, for example, so much has already happened you don't even know if it matters. I took a bathroom break and felt like it was easier to follow the action when I returned.Next, no original technology. It's all just stuff from the first two trilogies. The Phantom menace had some interesting toys (such as pod racers) and the Empire Strikes back a fantastic action sequence (a free falling Millennium Falcon navigating an asteroid field) and turtle Walker that was unrealistic as hell, but cool, but in this derivative junk, nothing to get excited about. Truth be told, Carrie Fisher was never the strongest character in the original trilogy who usually spent her time complaining that she wasn't being treated like a princess enough or waiting to be rescued. Making her the star general getting nearly everyone killed by being so a willy nilly didn't make her especially fun to watch. It's like driving on the freeway with your grandmother. Oh, wait, TWO grandmothers!Rey as a Mary Sue is sometimes likable about about as interesting as Luke Skywalker in the original trilogy. Consider Darth Vader in the original trilogy: He had a dark sense of humor (pardon the pun) while Kylo seems to just need a diaper change. The bad guy First Order types are just nasty, angry jerks while in the original empire, they were cool and collected while going about their evil duties. This film reminds me a lot like Battlefield Earth but at least Battlefield Earth had action. It didn't stay stale for too long and the bad acting and writing actually was kind of funny. When bad acting and writing isn't funny, or compelling, you just get something like the drivers ed videos you sat through in high school. (At least those were educational.)Finally, with the rebellion being so ineffective or even much more likable than the First Order it begs the question: Who cares? Who cares if the rebellion just gets blown up? Apparently, the rest of the galaxy doesn't seem to care and neither did I until these 3 tired stories wound their won their way out much like the popcorn out of my colon.",2,3,3,24 December 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Not as bad as Lucas would have done it
","It's no secret that most of Lucas's Star Wars films stank. It's easy to criticize so I'll reveal what I think made 'A New Hope', 'The Empire Strikes Back' and 'Phantom Menace' so great: Great characters and stories were allowed to be themselves. There wasn't a big concern with forcing a story to 'fit' into a fan universe. It's fiction. It doesn't have to make perfect sense. And much of the above logic takes place with Abram's interpretation as well except he had a directive to cast a diverse film. In theory, it could have worked. Look at how Lando's character in The Empire Strikes Back was so good. But again, shoehorning in doesn't work and making a female 'grrl power' lead in Ren was boring. Of course she's good at everything she does. She's a girl, right? The Luke Skywalker character started out in the first film as a farmboy who never saw combat. He didn't even throw a punch in the film. Like with Clone Wars, the new cast are largely 'red shirts' we care little about as viewers. Abram's ripped off most of the first film (A New Hope) from the sets to various elements of the plot lines. It's hard to tell if this is a ripoff, a homage, or a coincidence. In some ways, it's rather fun. I counted at least 20 similarities between New Hope and Awakens. What Lucas did better with Phantom Menace was to start out the series somewhat fresh which worked because the story to New Hope he'd have to reconcile with was 15 years off in fictional time. He could be free to let the show 'breath'. This film can end the series in an unpredictable manner. It's got its own 'future'. _ALL_ of the characters could die and the 'universe' would go on. There's hope (pardon the pun) that the two remaining films can take the plot in a new and creative direction without stealing from the old films or having to reconcile plot holes (and there are a LOT in this one.)All that said, the special effects and action (which is a huge component to the Star Wars franchise) was pretty good. They were enjoyable and didn't overCGI the viewer. The music and cinematography also was high class. After the novelty of these special effects wore off, it became a challenge to make the audience feel involved in the action and that's largely not a problem with this film. Disney clearly spent a lot of money and spent it well.",2,7,23,31 December 2015
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Almost like a (good) Tarentino take on the Bond series
","This reminds me of what Tarentino would have done with the Bond series similar to what he did with 70's era Kung Fu movies and action flicks but there's a twist: There are many who say that the theme to Kingsman is conservative. It's like Falling Down for James Bond. It's a similar experience to what I had with the Breaking Bad series which is leftist in feel and scope. In Breaking Bad, the implausible scenario is that a schoolteacher and DEA agent ultimately take drug money to help with their medical care because the government has lousy healthcare benefits. That's like saying Obama has to take the bus because the government doesn't provide him any transportation. It's laughable. But despite that leftist premise, I could enjoy that series.By the same token, I get the sense that the audience in the DC region theater were mostly leftist but enjoyed the film despite the tone of the film being one of the most conservative or right wing than I've seen in years. A savvy viewer will find a number of inconsistencies and plot holes but that goes for the Bond films as well. What 'secret spy' is quick to tell everyone he's a secret spy and sleep around and draw attention to himself? These plot holes are meant to be savored. Working class folks and the upper crust are both portrayed as yobs with a modern twist: NOBODY smokes. Ever. It's refreshing. Remember in the Bond films how everyone puffed away continuously? I hope this becomes a trend that is repeated in later sequels (which there will surely be.) The film appears to have recruited every potential spy and cameo imaginable. Mark Hamill, Michael Caine, Samuel Jackson, Colin Firth among others both pay homage to the Bond style thriller while introducing new elements (Jackson's particular performance is hilarious.) Watching in the theater was surprisingly enjoyable because, not in spite of, the other audience members that made obvious comments during some action sequences but were stunningly silent in others. I could feel their shock and relished it. Vaughn takes violence that had been reduced to pornography in modern Hollywood and gives it a new artistic twist while also knowing when to tone things back a little and introduce suspense.",10,13,23,20 February 2015
Moon," Liked it, despite the obvious plot problems
","This isn't serious sci-fi and it's not a shoot-up either. So it's rather hard to rate. The plot holes are so obvious that it sometimes distracts attention from the main plot and this contains spoilers otherwise what's the fun of picking them apart? At first, I thought this was on a Jupiter moon, because there were problems with 'live communication.' But it turns out to be our own moon where a decent dish antenna can pick up strong signals. In addition, the whole automated cloning scheme doesn't make sense when 'rescue ships' can be sent in a matter of hours to clean the politically incorrect mess. Finally, and this is the most annoying plot gap of all: How was the Bell character to be considered an 'illegal alien?' Like from Mars or Pluto or something? This was obviously a jab at USA immigration policy and talk radio but fell flat and nonsensical.Apart from those shortcomings, it was neat how the viewer is surprised to learn that rather than the protagonist being recovered from the accident we thought, it turns out that it was a fresh clone. Then we get to see how they figure out the ethics of killing their own clone or sacrificing one of themselves to pull off the scam at the end.Considering the cheap leftist political ploy mentioned above and the plot holes, it's not surprising that I missed this film first time out. I accidentally hit it when it was on cableTV.I liked certain elements of the film. How the main computer had a smiley face emoticon similar to facebook.",6,0,10,9 April 2011
Up in the Air," Makes you think in unexpected ways
","There are hundreds of other reviews that state the obvious and true aspects of the film including the insights into frequent flier business travel, the life of young and aging professionals, the emotions felt by people laid off and those worried about their job changing around them, and the fantastic acting in the film.What I found interesting about the film were the hidden insights into the directors, writers, and actors thinking as well as subtle cultural cues that the audience laughed at but may not have thought about at a conscious level.On the surface, the film is very leftist/Hollywood. Heartless corporate bosses can't fire their own workers so they hire an outside firm to do it for them. Haha! I googled the concept and couldn't find such a firm. In my own corporate experience, the heartless, gutless managers don't bother to pay someone like Ryan to fly in business class to layoff the workers. They simply take the day off and have their HR representatives do it. I unfortunately know this from personal experience. That's part of why I enjoyed the film.What was worth the price of admission was the dialogue between Ryan and the two generations of professional career women at a hotel lobby. All three of them are unapologetic selfish human beings. Ryan fires people for a living because it provides him with the lifestyle to run up frequent flier miles. This character also has a lot to do with Clooney's Hollywood alter ego. But the other two characters hit closer to home to the audience even if they didn't catch it. The young woman expressed post-feminist angst that while she loved earning lots of money and being able to pursue her career dreams, she worried about being able to land the perfect man. The older, attractive, and successful professional woman represented what the younger woman aspired to have (and in more ways than one, but I won't reveal how) but the older woman was more savvy about setting the 'have-it-all' expectations of the younger woman more, down to earth.So here the film features people getting laid off amid a bunch of professional bourgeois jetsetting around with their own selfish, shallow problems by comparison and they just don't 'get it' that they're part of the problem. It's a nice allegory for the writers of the film and even many of the viewers.When the film comes to an end, it doesn't leave the viewer's emotions all wrapped up in a neat bow but rather hanging where you don't know where the three characters' lives are leading. Indeed, the more successful, stable characters of the film are the ones who seem to have the most uncertainty.Many of the best one liners are also the most politically incorrect and totally not the kind of thing that George Clooney would say at an Oscars presentation but probably the kind of things he thinks in his daily life. The scene where he lectures the girl at the airport at how to 'save time' especially comes to mind. So much for him protecting minorities from sitting in the back of the theater! In the end, we're all 'up in the air', whether we know it or not, with the biggest baggage not being our relationships, at least with each other, but rather with our expectations of the world and our cherished beliefs.",10,0,2,4 June 2011
