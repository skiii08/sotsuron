Hereditary," Still recovering
","Saw this last night and was blown away. I'd say it's more reminiscent of Repulsion or Rosemary's Baby than the Exorcist (and all the better for it). It really works in creating a sense of creeping dread throughout - no jump scares, but a sense of things glimpsed out of the corner of your eye, in the shadows. The cinematography, soundtrack and acting combine to create a sense of unease and confusion. You don't quite know (until the end) whether what's happening is part of an hereditary mental illness and/or a sense of grief and guilt - is it real or imagined? There are some truly horrifying and disturbing moments - but they are used sparingly, particularly in the first part of the film - and are more powerful because of this. In some ways it's a study of a dysfunctional family and repressed anger/hostility, but that makes it even more horrifying, because it's very much based in reality. However, if you've got a low concentration level or want your horror to be all jump scares and CGI then you may be disappointed. It's more arthouse than traditional Hollywood blockbuster, which I thought was a pleasant surprise. A few people walked out of the screening I went to, not sure whether it was because they found it too slow or whether they found it too tense (probably the former). I'd say don't read too much about it beforehand and just go with it.",9,7,14,17 June 2018
