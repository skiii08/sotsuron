The Devil's Advocate," Very thrilling and interesting
","This movie was a very good movie. It was amazing seeing how disturbed Keanu's wife was becoming, and it all seemed to keep coming together.But I think that the greatest part of this movie was the acting.After watching this movie I noticed that Keanu Reeves is actually a good actor. I saw him in the Matrix and thought that he gave a horrible performance, but I now know that there is something else to Keanu's acting. Keanu Reeves does not show you he is acting. Instead he portrays reality, thus making his role more down to earth. I find this to be an even better kind of acting.Al Paccino is a great actor. The way he performs his role as Satan in this movie is very interesting, for when the movie is in it's beginnings he seems like a perfectly civil, smart, fun-loving person. But then you see what is happening, and how he represents TEMPTATION. He offers Keanu a perfect job. Keanu never loses a case. Al Paccino is surrounded by sex and sexy bodies. He does his role perfectly.Keanu's wife in this movie does her role well also. She portrays an innocent girl that has such a nice future, and then when Al Paccino starts screwing her up you see how horrible this crime is only because of the way she plays her character.This movie was a great movie. I saw it starting at 1:30 in the morning, so I was a little sleepy and started losing it towards the end, but I think that I was able to grasp it, even though as I am reflecting on it the end does seem a bit out of place... just see this movie while perfectly awake and you'll like it.",10,1,2,25 November 1999
Amistad," An honest portrayal
","This movie gave an honest portrayal of slavery. It showed just what it was like for the slaves being captured and shipped away.It also had an admirable story, and it was quite touching. I just loved the scenes where Cinque and the lawyer began to understand eachother. And the prolouge simply broke my heart and angered me to the bone.This movie, you should see.",10,0,2,25 November 1999
The Silence of the Lambs," A thrilling movie that will haunt you even after you have seen it
","This movie was very scary. I read the book first, so I knew what was going to happen, but the movie was still an amazing experience for me.The camera work was amazing. That must not be underlooked, but that was most definitely not the only reason that it was perhaps my favorite movie of all time.The acting was amazing. Anthony Hopkins was the perfect choice for Hannibal, and I think that the best performance OF ALL TIME was given by him in this movie. He also worked perfectly with Jodie Foster, and she worked perfectly with him. Not even Einstein could have created better chemistry than what went on between those two. When Clarice was interviewing Hannibal, I started shivering in fear. And as the movie went on I kept on getting more and more scared.But the acting would not have been so great were it not for the plot itself. The plot was scary and thrilling in itself.  And this movie had a good ending too. Some of the most perfect movies have an ending that lets you down, but this movie's ending was one of the best parts in itself. It set you up perfectly for the sequel that is coming out.",10,1,1,25 November 1999
