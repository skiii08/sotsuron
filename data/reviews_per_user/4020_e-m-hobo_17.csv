Men in Black 3," How do you know a great comedy?
","I got tears in my eyes at the end of it... Great comedies don't just make you laugh, they make you cry. It's the thing that happened that you just can't say. And it happened... And it happened again. That's what you get with time travel.Great characters, great comedy, great alien fun, and a lot of heart. Great movie.",10,1,1,3 January 2020
World War Z," Tight, exciting, awesome...
","Okay, no, it doesn't have the political implication that the book I still have to read has, but it is one of those movies that was so perfectly put together that it got me straight from the titles. It kicks off with the insane speed you want it to have, giving you only ample breathing space between turns, and just as you think you caught your breath, you find yourself gasping for air some more.I'm not really into the horror-thing, or so I always say, but this one with a sweet family-soldier man that got out of the action to be with his family and now has to fight to save the one thing he holds dear, once again proves me wrong.Is there a cure? It's what he is looking for, but is nature playing tricks on us? Nature, in this movie described as a serial killer, in every way has the upper hand during this movie, with the last of humanity the underdog and every safe haven another threat, another prison for our own souls. I just had fun, fun, fun. That's why you should watch it.For more politically oriented flicks, I suggest you watch 'The King' (2019) by the same producer. Need we be enlightened? Need we be entertained? I watched both and although polar opposites in terms of what they're about, if you want to be both enlightened and entertained, they do actually make a good pair. (Okay, 'The King' also has a little bit of fighting and mindless hordes.)",10,1,1,6 December 2019
12 Monkeys," Carefully crafted, well-stolen and reinterpreted, adding to the original...
","I remember watching this movie in high school, but I don't think I had the level of concentration back then, me being in my puberty, to fully grab the story. I watched this again yesterday and it's a wonderfully coherent painstakingly crafted story with rich wonderful characters and a smaller story that to me transcends the full scale of what we witness happen : the development of a relationship between the main character, mistaken for a mental patient, and his psychiatrist.The main character, a future convict, seeks to gain pardon by accepting a forced 'voluntary' mission to prevent the human race from being extinguished from the surface of the planet, forced to live underground like they now have been. It explores the same themes that the original, that I still have to watch, seems to explore - La JetÃ©e (1962). It doesn't just explore them, it does so well. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It hasn't aged a bit. I'm glad I'm not in my puberty anymore so I have a little less trouble actually getting it in full.If you haven't seen it or if you have when you were young or even when you were older, this is a movie worth watching and watching again.",10,0,0,15 November 2019
Shaun of the Dead," Not the mind bending thought provoking movie you'd not expect it to be...
","Well, that was fun. Boy met girl a couple of years back, refuses to grow up, loves to hang back with his friend that's about as productive as a zombie, but it takes an actual zombie-plague for them to rekindle their relationship that she so yes-it-was-the-right-thing-to-do-ishly ended.This is a movie about taking chances you shouldn't take. This is a movie about not seeing what's right in front of you while another one is trying to devour you from behind. This is a movie with slower moving zombies than in any other zombie-movie you've ever seen, but somehow the zombies remain an apparent threat to mankind anyway. This is a movie that's just too damn funny not to watch.Everybody dies someday and like the characters in this movie, you might just as well waste some amount of time on this spectacularly amusing flick without getting anything done. See it, feel it, don't believe anything they show, not even how this might or might not lead to a happy ending. It's all and that's only where the fun begins.Okay, the characters are honestly well defined. There. Happy. Just watch it. It's funninnininny!",8,0,1,5 December 2019
The Irishman," Man, gangsters are stupid!
","They tell it well. They did it with GOODFELLAS and they do it again with THE IRISHMAN : they make it painfully clear that gangsters are stupid and if you get people that stick to the law in charge of the law, there's no getting away with breaking the law, since they are just so plain obvious and stupid, trying to bribe their way into every nook, crease, and cranny society has to offer.What you get to see is what you get to see in many places : a fraternity backed by a sorority of what are essentially complete and utter dumb anarchists that just wear a different uniform than other anarchists, but other than that are really the same, that don't care about anything else other than their own personal gain, whims, and follies.If there's one thing you don't want to do in this world, for as far as these gangsters are concerned : it's making any kind of sense. They all want to live it up. They all want to live the good life. What they don't get for instance, constantly focusing on making as much money as possible, is that that what they see as the good life - wife, family, food - doesn't actually cost anything. Just learn to cook. It isn't that hard. Life is simple, the only thing you have to do, is keep it that way.Anyway, the one thing that's left in the middle is why the main character decides to tell his story in the end. I think that in the end, with all his friends deceased, the game is gone, which pushed what life is really about forward, namely his family and his desire to see his daughter again. His main problem being that even when he does tell the story, he feels no remorse, so will she see him again? But that's not what the movie is about. It's about his exploits, endeavors, politics, lack of comprehension, and being a soldier : doing what you're told to do. But what good is a soldier that can't even think for himself?I've had to change my reviewing ways a bit. First I had to get to a point where you get 9 stars if it's perfectly made, for as far as I can tell, and one more if it resonates with me. I hate gangsters, which is pretty much the same thing as saying that you hate people that just do stupid unlawful , which almost made me knock off a star. This movie definitely kept me watching and left me baffled how these people get away with what they do, because impulsive a.k.a. greedy people manage to get themselves into positions of social responsibility, which they don't feel, since it's all in the game. Okay, so I had to add a star because the (un)social relevance resonated with me.Loved the CGI, although their eyes seemed to look like they were wearing colored contacts when they made use of it, both to make younger and age? I think they also changed from more atmospheric color and directing to more hard-edged longer lens, bleak colors to kick in the grind of reality for the last bit of the movie, at the end of the story, when the game has come to an end? 'Pretty cool.'Anyway, as a throwout-question related to the movie, where do you stand after watching this? Is life about grabbing what you can grab? The game? Or love, health, and employment? Great movie.",10,1,7,28 November 2019
Molly's Game," Nurture beats the crap out of nature sometimes
","I tried watching a different movie with the same actress in the lead, also playing a character that most definitely broke the law: MS. SLOAN. I found the main character thus superficial and not likable, appealing to the ballsy kind of speak that only impulsive idiots would find gratifying, that I turned it off after ten minutes.Don't get me wrong, the acting was spot on, but MOLLY's GAME has a different angle and it gave me something I didn't find in Ms. Sloan: a character to both care for and root for, or at least hope that in the end she would find good cause to live for.Not withstanding that I can't tell in how far the real Molly would make me feel the same, everyone in the story is very human and also very flawed. Not in one way, but in many. Personally I'd rather trade knowing how to cook a bit for all the glitz and the glam in the world, because it's something you make and get to enjoy, while knowing what effort went into it, but I can't say I blame people for wanting to enjoy life.The only thing that bugged me is how much the important player in the game at the table would always break with gentlemanly conduct and proper Poker conventions. What he did was unsportsmanlike and a metaphorical knee breaker. So I do love Poker and the culture it's supposed to adhere to... Just another thing to to some extent enjoy about this movie.Great story. Heartwarming ending with a bit of a tear. (From the dictionary: 'a drop of clear salty liquid secreted from glands in a person's eye when they cry or when the eye is irritated')",8,0,1,20 October 2019
Pacific Rim," That was fun...
","This movie is a lot like, 'God, it's good to be a teenager again.' Let me just identify myself : male, thirty-nine years of age, well-educated, always consider the consequences. And this movie, I mean, it has monsters ... and robots ... and romance ... and bromance ... and love ... and loss ... and sacrifice ... and perseverance. So can they be victorious? I also think the Newton's Cradle was a nice little touch. Get it? Little? Touch? Aw, man, this movie was just so much fun.",9,0,0,16 November 2019
Justice League," Officially I'd rather give it 5.5/10 stars
","It wasn't the kind of superhero movie that makes use of the additional time a feature length movie offers to delve deeper into the characters, their backgrounds, how they feel, and what motivates them. That basically makes this one made for the special effects.The main problem I have with it is that it all feels very Deus Ex Machina and largely functional with very little actual struggle in terms of how they actually defeat the bad guy. It reminded me quite a bit of how I learned to control my nightmares as a kid: I always dug up magical potions that made me infinitely strong and threw all of the nasties over the mountains that scared me. This movie is sort of like that and mostly functional in the way it was conceived.It needs more character struggle and there hardly was any. Also, the fun friendly race at the end doesn't receive an ending, so we don't see who crosses the finish line first, and we should've seen that after the credits rolled, instead of something else.",6,1,4,23 September 2019
We're the Millers," I quote, 'Funny...'
","Well, I'm sorry, it's just that that's exactly what it was. I get a bit itchy with jokes sometimes or really any bad situations that make you feel that things can't go anywhere but south and they're just rubbing it in, rubbing it in, rubbing it in. This movie has quite a few of those moments, so I had to watch, pause, watch, pause, etc. It's just a fun movie with lots of stuff going wrong.It's a movie about, well, breaking the law, drug dealing ... and family, just not in the way we normally get to see it, more like family-family. And a big nut. Did I mention the big nut? It was a really big, pinched, slightly bleeding nut. Was it real? It looked real.It's fun. Just watch it.And yes, the characters are well-defined, the action both fun and exciting. It's just a fun movie without pretenses... And with a big nut.",7,1,2,25 September 2019
Silver Linings Playbook," Honest portrayal of really highly realistic characters
","I wanted to say an awful lot about this movie, but an awful lot has already been said.I don't think I can add too much to it. When you look at these wonderfully endearing yet disturbed people trying to find their way - the way they maybe see it: back to who they were; even though it's more about dealing with who you are, where you're at, and how you relate to life, love, and the people around you - it's about as accurate a portrayal as I've ever seen about people in these circumstances.It isn't just them, it's also the doctors that really haven't found a solution to any of their problems and the fact that the people that cure these patients quite frequently are the patients themselves, if they actually do manage to pull through and be cured. I'm not saying that the main characters come out cured, but they at least come out with a sense of now and how and who they want to be, but what that means, I think I'll leave up for you to enjoy.I hope some people will come out with the basic understanding that patients aren't crazy. You need to treat them friendly and adequately. My understanding through experience is that when you sit down with them and do provide proper argument without forcing it onto them, they can clearly discern what's real and what isn't. You don't have to jump them. You don't have to force feed them anything. You just sit down and talk. See what moves them and be honest with them. Most of them will get it.",9,2,2,23 October 2019
The Mist," Gut wrenching
","Well, that hurt. I had read about the mist and some of the twists and turns in various places. I think it's fairly well known, but it's nowhere near what you would want it to be, making it an honest depiction of people being people in the most horrid circumstances, that, as people do, turn on each other, rather than try to prevail as a people I guess. Great movie, but man, did it hurt. It really, really, hurt.",8,1,1,23 November 2019
A Quiet Place," No one is spared...
","Ultimately, what's at stake? Single family members? Humanity? Love? Regret? Mistakes? Understanding? Memories? Those we hold dear?This is a pretty tense flick that keeps you glued to the screen. I did have one thought as in a question that I would like to see answered : where did these damned beings come from? Outer space? Okay, but how did they land?I'm a little like, did anyone try turning on tree cutters and grinders? That's one of those elements that makes it a bit more difficult for me to fathom how humanity could really find itself in this position.But everything in the movie is really heartfelt. Loss, desperation, fighting on, giving up, sacrifice, searching for an answer. The family relationships and the way the individual characters both communicate and miscommunicate, for a large part because speaking is largely out of the question, are really well drawn out.I do feel some of the creative decisions were made a little too much based on the fact that hope and tragedy should be countered to a really large degree. It's a bit difficult to see how there wasn't another way out or at least an attempt at it, begging the question whether in this case it wouldn't have been more appropriate to actually make it a more uplifting movie.Mmm. I did like it. I definitely would want to see it based on how much I enjoyed it, knowing that I did. It has its only minor shortcomings, but it's thus heartfelt and otherwise really well drawn out in terms of character relationships that I can easily forgive the makers for these shortcomings.I also just noticed that they made or are making a sequel to be released in 2020. I will want to see that too.",8,0,2,19 December 2019
Rudy," I'm pretty sure I felt a tear in my eye...
","This is what we Europeans like to call an American movie, which means it's about hopes and dreams and it leaves you crying. Sometimes it isn't so much about winning with your team, although winning doesn't hurt either, but it's about being on the team, being able to walk out there... And that's what this movie is about.It's also about finding your path, your brothers, your other brothers, and being an inspiration to all that don't believe and knowing that they do want to believe. I really enjoyed this movie. And I'm really glad I watched it at home, alone, so no one saw my crying.Now I'm going to play my guitar to let it all out. I'm sure my neighbors will like that at this hour. (Spoiler alert.)",9,4,4,28 October 2019
Elysium," Clever
","It doesn't score that high a grades. I watched it without premonitions, but even if I had watched it with premonitions, it slammed me hard enough in the face with what it was about, and it was pretty clever. What's at stake? One life? Yours? Is there anything you can do? Should you try? Do you give up? And what does fate have in store for you?Fate is pretty important in this movie and its message rings heartfelt and true.Relevance?If you don't get safety, healthcare, a basic infrastructure, and the education you ask for, why do we pay taxes? We pay, but we get jack. No healthcare, doctors playing their own judges, the police not recognizing our democratically elected system of law, and a bunch of formerly rich family have-beens holding on to their last straws, realizing that they really aren't any better off than the rest of us, but keeping up pretenses to safeguard themselves, even though if they were to just do what they're supposed to do, no one would have anything to worry about.Some people don't like the story. I think it was honest and true. That's what I witness in the Netherlands and everywhere else. But hey, why find a parallel? I mean, the US, right? They pay taxes, have to get healthcare insurance anyway, that they pay for, but as soon as they get sick insurance kicks them out. Insurance is only there for those that don't need it. And tax payers' money? Use that to run GM into the ground.A bit of a spoiler, but not in terms of the plot.",10,1,2,7 January 2020
The King," He was right to deny the power they refused him to deny...
","What if schoolboys rule the world? Surely it's no different from when schoolgirls rule the world. Isn't it in school that seniority determines who's to say what's to happen? Or isn't that at least what the seniors mean to teach the juniors? Isn't that what the student nestors mean to teach the newly initiated student?Wisdom and impulsivity in practice are largely born to the person, although even the youngest that will be wise can be a little mischievous, but only require one fair spoken word to mend their ways. Do onto others and won't they be allowed to do onto you? Any little scoundrel can teach you that, even when they aren't called Kant.The story is an honest portrayal of the infidelities of the mind of those in power, sometimes led astray by those that seek power but not more than advantageous position. The King meant to break with the former King, his father's ways and seek peace. The King meant to leave the people be. The King meant for the people to enjoy the spoils of life and was no stranger to them himself.Why fight even though there's plenty of room to live? Why fight taking your people to war lest they suffer famine they hadn't suffered, had you not taken them to war? The wisdom resides in some young, some old, some men, some women, in none that favor a position of power. We love, stay healthy, and work, and choose to take care of all of our worries rather than create them.We should allow ourselves to do this and we shouldn't allow ourselves to be thwarted in our intentions and motivations as long as they are good. Great movie to illustrate that. Honest portrayal. Honest ending, both good and bad.",10,2,6,13 November 2019
The Wolf of Wall Street," A movie about a junkie
","The acting and all that is superb, but I can't just get the thought out of my head that this is what you're watching:THE WOLF OF WALL STREET is a movie about a regular guy that ends up as a Wall Street junkie hitting his wife in her stomach.I'm impressed by the storytelling and all that, but I have second thoughts when it comes to the story on display, and am afraid that a lot of people will misinterpret it and say: 'I want to get f***** up.'If you compare the content of this movie to a movie like APOCALYPSE NOW, the latter is often quoted for the line on the smell of napalm in the morning. In case of the redux version, I guess the French scene was added to the movie to explain to the audience that didn't get what they just saw, what it was they just saw.If you want to successfully produce a movie like this, you need to be able to include the moral in such a way, that it isn't just in plain sight for everyone to see, but people need to get that that's what they're seeing, without stressing it by saying, 'The moral of this movie is...'I'm not a big fan of movies like this, because they are prone to misinterpretation by the audience.",7,0,1,3 December 2014
Straight Outta Compton," Straight up story based on real life
","I should note that having watched for instance also 'The Dirt' about Mötley Crüe and checking some of the background story, that not exactly checking out a 100% of the time but touching the truth instead, I don't know what part of this story is real and what part isn't. I can only say how it felt watching this movie...It didn't feel like Straight Outta Compton sugarcoated anything. It was more like a straight-up kind of experience with people using, abusing, walking into every single pitfall you may imagine no matter what 'side' they choose to be on. The choices the based-on-real-life characters make are wrong a lot of the time, undermining the very opportunities presented to them by themselves, which is something they needed to recognize or maybe learn not to ignore.Pitfalls... Not knowing that as an artist you're the business, not some manager, any manager, that steps up to you saying that say, 'Hollywood' or whatever is the business. You have to have produce and you need to sell. That's something they themselves had to figure out. They were doing good, doing better didn't mean signing with a manager, it meant hanging in there. Did they need a manager? If they did, why had the manager already heard of them then?Acting on impulses, listening to bad advice, that all led to trouble. Some lived to learn, some died, in real life too as we all very well know. I'm sorry to see not all lived to learn, but the movie, even though it can only be partially true to life, I think it's a fair warning. Do the business, enjoy your life but don't live it up beyond, sorry but I have to say it, love, keep working, don't fuck it up.That's the one thing the movie didn't do that I do : rub morals into your face. Sorry for that. Don't listen to me, watch the movie and draw your own conclusions.",8,0,0,30 September 2019
