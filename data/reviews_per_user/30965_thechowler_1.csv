Hereditary," A masterpiece. Not your cliche Horror.
","This hands down takes the best Horror Film in 2018. It is not your cliche horror flick, it truly is unpredictable with genuine horror. I love how this film didn't need jump scares to create fear. The story line and execution are what created the putrid atmosphere - artistically intended of course.The scores were 10/10 as were the cinematography. The way it was shot and edited, it was very art-house, but still maintained a balanced foundation and didn't fly off to some wack concept like most art-house films do.I definitely would recommend this film to anyone looking for a solid, authentic horror.",10,2,4,27 July 2018
