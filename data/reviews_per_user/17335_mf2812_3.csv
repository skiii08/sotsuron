Hereditary," Brilliant. Simply Brilliant.
","I'm gonna keep this short and sweet. I absolutely loved this movie. But I totally get how others (including my better half) didn't. If you don't like slow-burners. Not for you.If you don't like cerebral horror in the slightest. Not for you. If you think jump-scares are a poor mans attempt to get your popcorn flying. Then this IS for you.It's a thinking man/woman's movie. Hands down, the best horror movie in years. 10/10",10,11,20,31 August 2018
Midsommar," Diabolical
","What a wast of time. Looks like it was written and directed by someone on acid. And no, my rating doesn't mean I didn't 'get it', it's this low because it was boring. There was a movie made 46 years ago covering most of the issues in this movie and is hands down better (The Wicker Man). Hereditary was great but I'd give this one a miss.",3,2,4,18 November 2019
It Chapter Two," Was it worth it?
","To the guys at the top, that's an easy answer. Yes.To the general public. Probably.To the Stephen King fan. No.Obviously covering an over 1000 page adaption is going to run into problems having just 6 hours to do so. But even at that, there was plenty of wasted time (especially in Episode 2) that could have been cut for more of the novels material. Just little things like explaining why it's an eye that comes out off Richies fortune cookie or a dead baby bird out Mikes. There's just so much that could have been changed and made no difference to the time. I mean, how much more would it have taken to show Beverley seeing that the doorbell said 'Marsh' at first, then it change to 'Kersh'. The end 'fight scene' was ALWAYS going to be a nightmare to put in front of an audience as it's easier in the book when you can let your imagination do the work and I think that's why there's the running joke all out through the movie about Bill's books having bad endings. The twist at the end was kinda cool and I actually hoped that they'd do it this way rather than the book as it's heartbreaking to see them forgetting who each other is all over again.All in all it is a fine movie but there's no scares whatsoever and it just seems like some different shape of the actual 'IT' is tearing towards the camera shaking their heads in a weird way (think the alley scene in 'Jacob's Ladder').Worth it for a one, maybe two time watch and overall for the series together:Chapter One - 8
Chapter Two - 6Overall - 7",6,2,2,21 October 2019
