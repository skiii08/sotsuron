10 Cloverfield Lane," This movie could become a franchise if it's done smart
","What's up guys,This movie is one of the movies that gives you low expectations but shocks you when actually see it!!! If I can tell you anything, I'll tell you this fact: this movie has potential, and believe me when I say that it was that good for me to think of it becoming a franchise. I mean think of the number of questions left that even makes you wonder more and more. yeah, it is not the first movie of its genre but absolutely excels in keeping the appeal. I don't really want to talk about the story of the movie because even the slightest hint might ruin the movie. It is not the kind of movie where you can expect every and each move. It is entirely the opposite. A must see movie for me. Man, I just hope they consider a sequel or something. Quite the experience!!!",9,0,2,5 June 2016
