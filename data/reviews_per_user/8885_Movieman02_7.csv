United 93," A Movie You Can 'Feel'
","I'm going to have to give United 93 4 out of 4 stars.I saw this movie with about as many people in the theater as there were on the flight itself. It made the movie seem more real than it already was, and believe me, that is VERY real.I have never (after watching thousands of movies) felt more nervous during a movie than I have tonight. It wasn't special effects or a new type of story with a smart villain that did it. It was the terrifying fact that these people we're real and this story actually happened. I knew what fate awaited these people, but no one knows exactly what happened on board.As the movie moves along at it's real - time speed, you feel like you are both in the United 93 flight, and in the Air Traffic Control center at the same time. The environment was recreated with intense realism. You learn at the same time as the ATC staff about the hijacked planes and the destruction of the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. The movie was (needless to say) very well researched. Not many movies accomplish such a feat. The director poured unmeasurable effort and care into his film to recreate this horrific event.This is one of those rare movies with absolutely no humor in it whatsoever. It is irrelevant. Serious movies use humor as 'relief', United 93 does not want you to feel relief, it wants you to feel everything the passengers felt as they went through it.This movie left me speechless after wards and if I wasn't with company (who were also speechless) I probably would have stayed in the theater until they had kicked me out. I 'felt' this movie more than I have with any other movie. I wanted to help out those passengers. I wanted to charge at the hijackers, regain control of the plane and show those terrorists why Americans will always defeat them because we believe in our country! I wanted to call my family and tell them that I won't be coming home because I was about to die for the greatest country in the world so that terrorism and the slaughtering of innocent people will not take place. I wanted to fight a war on terrorism.God Bless America.",10,1,4,29 April 2006
Pulp Fiction," This Could Be The Greatest Movie Ever Made
","I think that Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction is not just a great movie, but quite possibly the greatest movie ever made. It has everything that a movie-goer would love to see in a movie. A great script full of plenty of gross-out moments, shocking moments, humor, great lines, and parts that make a watcher think. The film does not treat the audience like a moron like so many recent films have the tendency to do. It leaves you on the edge of your seat and you have to have an IQ that is larger than your shoe size to fully understand it.Tarantino also use time as a plot driving device in the most effective way I have ever seen put to film. I guess you could say that the film is in 'flashback' form, but the characters and the plot that you see in those 'flashbacks' make you forget that it has already happened! Along with the monster performances that Samuel L Jackson, John Travolta and Uma Thurman put on the table (not to mention the small, well acted part Quentin Tarantino did himself) makes this movie a 5 out of 4 star movie and an instant classic. Enjoy, it comes highly recommended by yours truly,Movieman02",10,1,3,3 January 2005
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," It'll blow you away.
","Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels is one of those rare movies that flies under the radar until it gathers a cult following.This is Guy Ritchie's directorial debut. The story focuses around five groups of people, but mainly four friends who are now in deep trouble when Tom, a highly skilled card shark, loses in a card game that was rigged. They find themselves a quarter million dollars in debt and have only a week to get out of before 'Hachet' Harry will start chopping their fingers off. The other story lines come into play when Tom and his three friends try to figure out a way to come up with the money.What I like about this film is the fresh script writing and odd humor. The opening sequence (Jason Statham street peddling with help from Jason Flemming) sets the right pace for a comedic and fast paced flick. From there we are introduced to every other character in their own unique way. My favorite characters have got to be Big Chris and Little Chris. Big Chris (played by Vinnie Jones) is the kind of character that was placed in the script to be the tough guy. Usually the tough guy is someone rather generic, but Guy Ritchie places Little Chris (Peter McNicholl) as Big Chris's young son to show a soft side to Big Chris. Big Chris tries to keep Little Chris from becoming a mindless thug by showing him how to do things properly without using foul language and such. The two characters become very comedic and do not become tired over the course of the movie.Another great element of this movie is the soundtrack. I actually got ticked off when one of the songs stopped playing when I wanted it to go on. Very stylish and the music seems to go right with every scene.Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels is highly enjoyable and won't disappoint you.8/10",8,4,5,20 August 2005
Iron Man," Better Than You Would Think
","I was by no means an Iron Man fan going into 'Iron Man'. I was when I left the theater though.Robert Downey Jr. plays his character, Tony Stark, to perfection with the comedic timing and seriousness you come to expect from such a fine actor. He doesn't take anything away from the depth of the character by trying to be too 'cool.' I could mention the great effects that you've undoubtedly heard about 1,000 times before, but it's not about that. Once you get past the effects you are still left with some good twists and turns and you will find yourself enjoying the story more than the action.It won't win Best Picture, but then again, neither did Spiderman.",8,1,4,7 May 2008
Sin City," Absolutely Beautiful
","This is a truly beautiful movie. It is black and white, but with a little bit of color. Mostly red, like blood and various objects. As you watch, everything looks real but you can tell that there is just something 'different' about the way the cars drive and the way the people go about their lives. Nothing is as it seems.The acting is impressive as well. Mickey Rourke plays his character, Marv, outstandingly. Hopefully, Marv will renew his squandered career and we will get to see him in more good movies. Bruce Willis has now shown that he can play a tough guy with feelings instead of just a tough guy. Nick Stahl was a creep. Jessica Alba was seductive. Brittney Murphy was helpless (in a good way).I thought, for the first time, that this movie that was based on a comic book is actually a moving comic book. Spiderman did not leave that feeling, The Hulk did not leave that feeling, Dare Devil sure as hell didn't leave that feeling. Just Sin City. And it left me wanting more. Sequels Away! (I never thought I would say that!)",10,1,3,11 June 2005
True Romance," An Entertaining Love Story
","True Romance (Tarantino's first script put to film) is a highly entertaining love story. It centers around two characters named Clarence and Alabama who fall in love on their first meeting. The catch is this, Alabama is a call girl hired to have sex with Clarence on his birthday. Of course, she falls in love with him and Clarence returns her feelings. Trouble with this scenario is that Alabama still has a pimp that wants her back to business. Clarence decides he needs to do something about it, like kill him. When he goes to retrieve her lugauge, he accidentally gets a suitcase full of cocaine that he decides he needs to sell. All hell breaks lose from this point on due to the fact that the owner of the cocaine would like it back.Tarantino writes a winner. The story is fast paced and keeps the viewer tuned in. A lot of good lines are found in the script. Most importantly however, the viewer is not left scratching his head at the end. It ties together well.True Romance has an all-star cast with stand out performances by Christian Slater, Dennis Hopper, and Bronson Pinchot. If your a movie goer that sees movies for performances, True Romance is perfect for you.Enjoy! 9/10",9,1,2,13 September 2005
The Island," One of the Best Sci-Fi Movies of the Last 20 Years.
","I thought that Micahel Bay's 'The Island' was going to be good, but I honestly did not think that it was going to be as good as it is! Everything about this film had me SCREAMING for more. The plot is outstanding, the acting is very good, and the action is heart pounding.It also had me intrigued as to what might really happen if clones were made and if they really had feelings. So I guess that I consider this movie a 'Think Piece' as well. You'll know what I'm talking about if you see it. Scarlett Johanssen is amazing, Ewan McGregor plays dual roles, and Steve Buschemi (believe it or not) does a fantastic job.It has been said that Michael Bay is a terrible director, but do not listen to that, because this movie is easily his best. You will not find any element of the bore fest 'Pearl Harbor' was, or the crap fest 'Bad Boys II' was. Just flat-out action packed 'The Island'.",10,2,6,23 July 2005
