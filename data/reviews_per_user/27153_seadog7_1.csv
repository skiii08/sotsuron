The Blair Witch Project," ummm...no
","They did a great job promoting the film(I read and enjoyed the Dossier , which filled me in on the legends of the Blair Witch, and had all sorts of interviews and 'police photos', adding to the documentary feel) and the idea of not ever really seeing exactly WHAT it was that tormented these people was an interesting touch, thus letting the viewer fill in and details the video cameras leave out. And the ending, though abrupt, fit in quite well. My praise for the film ends there. Maybe it was the fact that I made the mistake of watching it on the small screen with my mother (BAD IDEA!) who took it upon herself to comment on how disgusting the language was just about every other minute: that really distracts from the plot. Distractions aside though, the film just didn't terrify me.",Null,0,1,5 August 2001
