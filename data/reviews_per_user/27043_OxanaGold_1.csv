Requiem for a Dream," Great movie
","I changed my habits a lot after I sow this movie! It is so impressive one! I just love it so much!I am using a lot from this movie for auditions/casting calls. I thing all actors just great and I usually do not watch movies twice or more - just one time! But this one I did see many times and would watch again and I ll show it for my baby so she ll now what drugs can do with your life! It has a lot of horrible feelings and episodes but in generally it is just really memorable and emotional movie! I think if producers/screen writers will make drugs look like this, it will be much less problems with people who choose this type of life.",10,1,2,11 May 2015
