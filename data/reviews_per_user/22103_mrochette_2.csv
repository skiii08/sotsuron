Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Fantastic movie - worthy addition to the star wars saga
","Unlike some other viewers or critics who underrated this movie (and sometimes reviewed before having seen it and made Lucas very angry) I believe it's a fantastic movie, a successful addition to the saga.
It's full of action, adventure, incredible jedi-battles with a refreshing hint of politics and diplomacy. (These last two points were absent from the originals since the Empire and the Rebels were in a state of civil war. Check out Star Wars' introduction.)We can see at last see the 'old' republic and how it worked and functioned; in fact setting the background for the events to come.We have in this movie all the elements of the originals with touches of Lucas' magic: the queen's incredible dresses, the computer generated characters which completely blend in the action, Darth Maul's painted face (which has some asian influence in it) and the human interactions master/student conflicts, tricks, jokes and deceptions.All in all a 10-star movie!",10,72,117,12 June 2001
The Mummy," Great Popcorn movie! Fantastic Fun!
","The mummy (1999) is the return of the Egyptian terror theme renewed and updated to the 90's.The story is good, compelling and exciting like an Indiana Jones movie while having some fun and humor into it.The egyptian theme has been thoroughly researched by director Stephen Sommers: -the name Imhotep is truely egyptian (not invented) as it relates to the famous Imhotep, architect of thee stepped pyramid of Saqqara.-Secondly, the egyptian reading and speaking are also correct. -the statues of Horus and Anubis correspond to the egyptian style (not like in Stargate where the eye of horus symbol is displayed but named 'eye of ra')The actors are excellent with a slight 'British humor' style which is definitely refreshing in an American movie.Finally the special effects are mind-blowing with a superb opening shot in the ancient city of Thebes. The digital mummies are also greatly rendered by ILM.Whatever aspects of this movie you prefer (action, humor, story, SFX) you'll definitely love it.A true gem 10/10.",10,4,5,21 May 2001
