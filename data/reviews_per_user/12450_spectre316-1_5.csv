The Ring," mixed review
","I've been waiting to see this movie for a long, long time. Of course I never saw the original one, because of no distribution whatsoever in the United States. But even so, the trailer (which I viewed nonstop on the Internet) was ... breathtaking. It reassured me that a good and well made scary movie was finally going to come around.It's definitely well made. The movie looks absolutely amazing. The music is perfect, really makes you feel like impending doom is about to be unleashed.But the film did a horrible job in explaining the plot.. I had a talk with some of my friends after the movie, and it took us about an hour to fully get it.Other bad things: the dialogue is pretty weak, and we have another cliched boy wonder (David Dorfman) who has big, big eyes and is in tradition of Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense. He knows lots and people confide in his words. Ugh.Nonetheless, the film works on some levels, mainly the ones I stated before. The video itself is pretty damn creepy, in grand tradition of the Nine Inch Nails 'Closer' video (with chairs spinning really fast upside down and all, etc). And the cinematography gives it loads of atmosphere.So if you're expecting a scary good time, by all means come and watch this film. But don't expect to know what the hell it all means until you have a couple brain cramps afterwards.**1/2 out of ****",6,0,0,20 October 2002
Minority Report," An important film
","Spielberg has been on a great film run -- creating two highly experimental yet so amazingly intelligent films in two years ('A.I' and this such film). I must say 'Minority Report' is definetly the one that risks more, that uses real challenging ideas and puts them to use in the best effect possible.Every single shot in this film appears to be nearly flawless; and the rather confusing idea of Pre - Crime (which could be lost on the majority of viewers) is told with painstaking detail with such a fast pace that it immerses you totally into the film.The acting, the cinematography, and scene after scene... it's just that everything seems to work in such a great amazing way. It's such an important film, really -- it's something that I have never really seen before. Some of the minor ideas may not be entirely original, adimittenly. But the story told is such an amazing story that it doesn't seem to matter. The direction, acting and cinematography truly make this film seem nearly entirely original.One of Speilberg's best.",10,0,0,5 July 2002
Insomnia," one of the best films I've seen in a long time
","Almost to the point of rivaling Christopher Nolan's other great film, 'Memento.' Everything just works. The score, the dialouge, the beautiful, beautiful cinematography, and everything is incredibly tense. Nolan is now one of my favorite directors.",7,0,0,26 May 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," not my kind of film, i guess?
","Wow. This film is loved by nearly everyone on the face of this earth, and is, of course, high in the top 250 at imdb.com. I don't really get it, but I guess it's not my thing. Should be certainly true, especially when it's loved so feverishly much.I don't know what to say; it didn't keep my interest really. There were some pretty well done moments, but there were moments (long, long moments) where I was either bored out of my mind or nitpicking the CGI.Good thing is that there's nothing wrong with any of the CGI. It's nearly flawless. Sadly, it seemed like the whole damn movie was made out of CGI. I was noticing how much there was of it, and I realized nearly three quarters through that all I was really doing was seeing how the CGI worked into scenes. What a distraction. I know Jackson wanted the battle scenes to be filled with millions of people, but couldn't he used close up shots of real people (less, but still a lot)? It's definitely possible. Look at some battle scenes from movies made before 1997.And the cinematography got down right muddled and uninteresting at points. Except for the rare nice shots, the whole movie seemed to be filmed with the same sweeping camera movements (over the battle scenes) and used the brown looking color scheme a bit too much.The characters themselves aren't very interesting. Frodo gets downright annoying sometimes. I'm sorry to say I've never read any of the books, and I can only imagine what it did for the characters in them. They're probably wonderful, imaginative, compelling stories. If so, this film is ultimately generic.All I'm saying is that it's not my cup of tea. Obviously, it's millions of others. That's cool though.What would be even cooler is if I could show some of these hardcore fans Jackson's 'Heavenly Creatures.' I wonder how much they'd like 'The Two Towers' then.",Null,0,0,8 January 2003
Vanilla Sky," One odd piece of cinema
","Cameron Crowe must of wanted to make this kind of film for a long time - you know, the 'Fight Club' style film; basically a David Fincher/Lynch film. You can tell he probably had a lot of enthusiasm for this project -- because ideas and images and plot twists just pop up everywhere; it's definetly not without reason though.I would never expect anything like this to pop up in wide release. But then again 'Fight Club' did before it, so it's logical for this to do so. Yeah, yeah, it stars Tom Cruise - and I strongly believe he's a very underrated actor - but if it didn't star him, I doubt this would of gotten as much publicity as it did.But thank God it stars Tom Cruise. This is an actor of such high quality that the film sometimes in moments depends on him. Good scenes are good scenes because of his sometimes unbelievable acting. He is David, he breathes David, he's a womanizer who basically can't seperate dreams from reality.This really is an odd piece of film. The atmosphere is tense and sometimes very, very weird. The club sequence, for example. It begins odd (in a good way) and ends on a more down note. Several scenes take to this way.In the end, this film is really some sort of weird brilliance. I admire Cameron Crowe -- thank God he charged through with this tricky material and came out with something of a surreal masterpiece.",Null,0,0,6 July 2002
