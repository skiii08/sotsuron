The Rock," Finally about the characters
","This is one of the best movies I've ever seen in my 14 years on Earth. I've been exposed to a lot of Polish, American,English, and Indian movies. Yet, there are very few that come even remotely close to The Rock. The expert acting, directing, and screening make this movie a 10.0 in my book without any doubt! Sean Connery gives an amazing performance and so does Nicholas Cage! I don't want to spoil the movie for you, but whether you like action, drama, romance, or any other major category... trust me, you'll enjoy this movie. This movie has great sound and my favorite thing about it is the character development. I found it a great way to spend two hours and it never gets old. I give this movie a 10 out of 10.",10,2,3,11 December 2006
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Inspired by The Good The bad and The Ugly
","This is a movie that you cannot stop watching due to the martial arts, effects, and action. The music is portrayed beautiful in a great manner. This movie reminds just of Good the Bad and the Ugly. The music all the action sequences, the hardcore attitude, and the great storyline that proceeds to it as it all goes together to perfection. Tarentino being a fan of martial arts knew exactly what he was doing from the beginning. Uma Thurman played her part perfect with the emotion and sensitivity. David Carradine played his part perfect as the assassin who wanted to kill her but still cared about her and wanted her to be a warrior and even better then him. I found this movie very enjoyable a typical Tarentino movie, he hit another one rite on the point. I give this movie a 9 out of 10. A great martial arts movie.",9,2,4,11 December 2006
Casablanca," Truly one of the greatest..
","Casablanca is the dominant Hollywood film. It is superbly directed, acted, and filmed. Bogart is amazing, the characters are deep and engaging.This is easily one of the greatest films of all time. The story is timeless and meaningful, full of heart and should endure for another fifty years with no problems. A true masterpiece and the benchmark by which all other films should be measured.Humphrey Bogart one of the greatest does his greatest act in this movie If you haven't seen it, you are at a you need to at least rent this timeless classic. If you have then you know the greatness of this film. I give this film a 10 out of 10.",10,4,6,15 December 2006
Citizen Kane," One of our favorites..
","Citizen Kane (according to the American Film Institute) is the greatest film ever made.I can assure any readers one thing: Citizen Kane is timeless. I am not simply following the crowd, as I thought one to many official movie reviewers were doing. I agree with them Citizen Kane lives up to the hype, just about.Citizen Kane is nearly perfect, and were it not for some small details in the second half of the film, it would be.Nearly everything perfect. The musical score, in particular, is the best I've ever seen. The film has charisma, charm. The acting is impeccable. The script fantastic. It's epic. And all done by a 25-year-old, which really gives it full marks.And especially for the time, it must have been incredible. The cinematography, the landmark qualities, everything was so original and new. But in the final half hour, deeper insight is necessary. We are left hanging on a thread, wondering especially after some incidents how the newsroom is going. We know little of Kane newspapers, though the dilemmas in his personal life are particularly well played out.",9,3,4,15 December 2006
12 Monkeys," Willis is Great..
","Time paradoxes are the devil's snare for underemployed minds. They're fun to consider in a 'what if?' sort of way. Film makers and authors have dealt with this time and again in a host of films and television including 'Star Trek: First Contact', the 'Back to the Future' trilogy, 'Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure', 'Groundhog Day' and the Stargate SG1 homage, 'Window of Opportunity'. Heinlein's 'All You Zombies' was written decades ago and yet it will still spin out people reading that short story for the first time.In the case of Terry Gilliam's excellent film, '12 Monkeys', it's hard to establish what may be continuity problems versus plot elements intended to make us re-think our conception of the film. Repeated viewings will drive us to different conclusions if we retain an open mind.Some, seeing the film for the first time, will regard Cole, played by Bruce Willis, as a schizophrenic. Most will see Cole as a man disturbed by what Adams describes as 'the continual wrenching of experience' visited upon him by time travel.Unlike other time travel stories, '12 Monkeys' is unclear as to whether future history can be changed by manipulating events in the past. Cole tells his psychiatrist, Railly (Madeleine Stowe), that time cannot be changed, but a phone call he makes from the airport is intercepted by scientists AFTER he has been sent back to 1996, in his own personal time-line.Even this could be construed as an event that had to happen in a single time-line universe, in order to ensure that the time-line is not altered...Cole has to die before the eyes of his younger self for fate to be realized. If that's the case, time is like a fluid, it always finds its own level or path, irrespective of the external forces working on it. It boggles the mind to dwell on this sort of thing too much.If you can change future events that then guide the actions of those with the power to send people back in time, as we see on board the plane at the end of the film, then that means the future CAN be changed by manipulating past events...or does it? The film has probably led to plenty of drunken brawls at bars frequented by physicists and mathematicians",10,0,0,10 December 2006
Ice Age: The Meltdown," Not as good as the First but OK...
","The sequel to 2002's Ice Age has managed to recapture the magic of the first film, whilst beating off most recent efforts into CGI films that didn't come from Pixar. This time around the three friends Manny, Sid, and Diego must join their newly formed herd to escape the valley they are living in, as the ice is beginning to melt, and threatens to flood the valley.Like last time, there is no grand plot here (the first being based on another journey, this time to return a child to its family), and it merely serves to introduce new characters and create laugh-out-loud situations for the trio to overcome. Of the new characters, all are competent (Queen Latifah's Mammoth-Possum-wannabe is good) but never take the lime-light away from our original heroes, which is as it should be; although I did particularly like Will Arnett's Lone Gunslinger Vulture, a rather apocalyptic vulture. All the personalities are back, as is the bickering between them  slightly more playful than last time.Some standout scenes include Sid's initiation into a tribe of fellow Sloth's, and the origins of whack-a-mole with the possums  all the episodes are loosely connected by a plot which is there to serve for convenience, but this doesn't matter as the film is inventive enough to look past structural failings and just enjoy it. It has increased the fear factor somewhat  the group have to evade two nasty looking sea creatures that have been thawed out by the melting ice, and these scenes, although thrilling, can be scary for younger viewers.Ice Age: The Meltdown keeps its individual style of animation; at times crossing between its general cartoon-look and then throwing in some genuinely brilliant effects  the underwater shots in particular, and also the effect of the animal's fur after they leave the water are very nice. But it's through the cartoonish style that Ice Age: The Meltdown manages to keep its charm, and there is plenty to go around.",6,0,0,15 December 2006
Crash," A Now a Day Film..
","To the nay-sayers of this film i have one thing to say to you:This Film deserved best picture.Of the five films,this was the ONLY one with a subject not worn out:real life issues.Sure Brokeback Mountain was a good film this was probably the safer choice. love story has been done MANY times.CRASH shows the world if you judge people, you are only judging yourselves.When I was sitting down in the movie theater to watch this film,i was glued to the opening sequence(probably one of the most exciting ever). This was more than a movie,it was a life experience. I admit that once I was like one of these characters and I'm sure everyone has to.Director Paul Haggis will be a force to be reckoned with in the future.CRASH left a lasting impression to me and hopefully to all.",Null,5,10,11 December 2006
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," The best of the three..
","This was it. The final battle. The exciting build up to the ending that we had all been waiting for after the Empire Stikes Back, questions to be asked that were finally answered: Will Han Solo be rescued from Jabba the Hutt? Will Luke Skywalker face Darth Vader a second time? They made it very convincing in all aspects. It truly closed the show gretaThe performances were great and the script was perfect to the book on this film, like The Empire Strikes Back where you see great performances as well as bang for your buck.This is the best of the trilogy and it sticks to the original standards.",10,2,4,10 December 2006
Taxi Driver," DeNiros greatest move...
","DeNiro was lucky to play this part as five other great actors were offered to be in the role but turned it down. So DeNiro meets Scorsese, Scorsese meets DeNiro and one of the greatest movie bonds are formed. In this movie DeNiro portrays a psychotic taxi driver who is trying to turn his life around. he meets a girl (Jodie Foster) who is indeed a prostitute, and they fall in love so now the pimps are getting mad and this causes DeNiro to enrage which inevitably causes him to kill and become the man he did not have to be. It is indeed a slow pace movie but portrays New York life style beautifully and is on of Scorsese's greatest achievements.",9,0,1,22 November 2006
We Are Marshall," Sad Stroy of Friendship and Teamwork
","This was a great movie, not a superb one but good. The action was on par, the emotions were st great. But this movie is not about that it is about what happened to that team and how the school was changed. It is a feel good story at the end that makes you want to cry but feel good at the same time. I was surprised that Matthew McConaughey was able to play a role as important as this one. But he played as he should have the coach that would not stop and keep pushing his team to the top to give the town and school and kids something good for a change. I also thought Matthew Fox played good coming off such roles as Lost. Every scene in this movie is a good performance and gives you something to think about. And everyone plays there part as if they are the real people from that town.There is a good lesson taught in this movie to never give up no matter how bad things get you can always refurbish yourself. This is a good movie to bring your kids to, it is not scary but it will be sad at how realistic they made it seem. Also it is another good sports football genre movie along side Remember The Titans and Rudy. So I recommend you to bring your family to this movie and you will not be disappointed at the least. I give this movie a 7 out of 10.",7,8,9,23 December 2006
The Godfather: Part II," If not the finest sequel ever made.
",When i first saw this movie I had just seen the God Father 1 which blew my breath away i didn't expect much out of sequel especially one that had to compare to that. So i watched it and i was speechless a sequel that arguably could have been better then the first one. It is without a doubt the greatest sequel ever made. It proves that if u put Al Pacino in a crime movie there can be no wrong doing. Francis Ford Cappola comes back with another great classic to be put into the movie books. This one had a little more aggressiveness and anger which i liked and brought me back into the world of the God Father. I can not think of a better sequel then this. This will always be a classic in my mind.9out10.,9,0,1,22 November 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," ]The beginning of a great story
","It is with no surprise that Peter Jackson's The Fellowship of the Ring film has received such mixed critics. Many viewers refer to it as being childish, boring and uninteresting. Seems to me that it is bound to the same fate of Tolkien's books, destined to be a target for the same type of misunderstandings that keep attacking this literary masterpiece many decades after it's first publication.The Lord of the Rings is a fairy-tale of myth and fantasy. Peter Jackson directed a film that was considered, for a very long time, impossible to make, and not only for technical reasons. The narrative roots are incredibly long and detailed, and the storyline is deeply connected with the creation of a fantastic continent from a time unknown called 'Middle Earth'. It's author, Tolkien, dedicated a considerable part of his life developing this continent's background, it's mythology and origins, it's different kinds of people, cultures and languages, and therefore it's geographic references are determinant to the unfolding of the story of the One Ring.Peter Jackson went out to achieve the impossible and came out with a recreation of the original that is pure and true to the story in every detail. The first time the four hobbits meet a black rider on the road, for example, is absolutely faithful to the feeling of the book. The assault of the riders at Weathertop is another great example, and it captures that feeling of danger, density and atmosphere that are the main characteristics of the tale. Jackson also took some liberties with the story, and made some right choices along the way. If the so called 'purists' may not approve the removal of Tom Bombadil altogether, it should be comprehensible that the travel from Hobbiton to Rivendel is a very long and detailed one and could easily make a movie on it's own. I felt more uneasy with how short the Council of Elrond was. In the book, the council is where the whole story of the rings is first explained, and many passages from the past ages of Middle Earth are unveiled. It is a fascinating moment of the story, that had to be shortened for obvious reasons. Still, after some consideration, I now agree with the options made by Peter Jackson, and think that the movie prologue narrated by Galadriel was the wisest choice. The magic is all there when Gandalf shuts his eyes the moment Frodo stands in the council and says 'I will take the ring'. It is there at Moria's Gate, and at the fall of Boromir. It is a powerful film that doesn't fit the rhythm of the standard Hollywood action movie. It is a film that breeds, that takes time to unfold, it's tale branching in every direction.I could go on and on, talking about all the different elements that bring this film close to perfection, but I'll end saying that deep down, this is not about action, beards and big monsters. The greatest thing about this film, to me, is that it brought me back to a time when I was in love with a different world where everything was possible. Reading The Lord of the Rings night after night, I came to understand what this thing of 'mankind' really was all about. The corruption of absolute power, the importance and value of friendship, the inevitability of growing up, the strength of hope... That this film could capture that magic, and be a new bearer to it's message of humanism, is a statement to it's greatness. Gandalf's words, that even the smallest person may change the course of the world, and have a part to play in the destiny of all, are immortal.In the end, this is a wonderful film, but that doesn't mean you are going to like it. I cannot tell you what it is like to see this film if you don't know or love the book. But I hope it may plant a seed on your heart to discover a great world of fantasy, beauty and humanity. I believe Tolkien would have liked that.",10,1,2,10 December 2006
Armageddon," It is what it is...
","This movie seems to be a movie that many people love to hate. I don't see why it has such a bad reputation. It is meant to be an Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi movie, and it definitely lives up to this. It is what it is. Many people have tried to compare it to Apollo 13, but that's like comparing apples and oranges. They are entirely different fruit. Apollo 13 is based on a true historical event (Docu-drama), while Armageddon is an Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi movie. It has plenty of action and adventure, a lot of humor, and a bit of romance.Is the story realistic? Not hardly, but name ANY Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi movie that is. That's why they call it Science fiction. For those who criticize this movie, nothing will change their minds. However, if you haven't seen Armageddon, take a chance, watch with an open mind and try not to let all these negative reviews spoil your enjoyment of a really fun movie. Remember, a movie is meant to be funny with a somewhat story, I find this movie to be a good 2 and a half hours of mostly laughter and great punchlines. This is a great movie if you let it be. I give this movie an 8 out of 10.",8,1,2,15 December 2006
Face_Off," Cage and woo make it..
","Throughout the 80's John Woo along with others like Sam Raimi and Tery Gilliam was the cult fans favorite and known to them as the best action movie maker in the world Face/Off is Woo at his over the top, furiously paced finest, the story might be highly implausible and its handling hysterical but it serves to give the film the playground that both Woo and his actors thrive in. The action scenes are tremendous, staged as only Woo really can and strangely for this usually vacuous genre there is a strange kind of social commentary about the importance of family and marriage that has been overlooked by many. Up there definitely as one of the best action/adventure films ever. I give this movie a 8 out of a 10 for being put together as a great action movie.",8,0,0,10 December 2006
Jarhead," Remake Of Full Metal Jacket Except Worse
",From the beginning of this movie it started slowly. The movie gave the image of a kid who loves sex and nothing else. The movie writers tried to make it seem real but would a kid really talk about that. Jamie Foxx puts on a good act and seams like a good Sargent but wasn't mean enough. If that was real the soldiers would have been a lot more professional and experienced. They made it as if they would have only gone into one battle. On the commercial they showed a lot of fighting which created false advertising and made it have to live up to higher expectations. It is just like full metal jacket they are beginning marines and getting ready for war but the staff srg(Jami Foxx) isn't as realistic as he could be a drill srg would not have let that man get shot and he would have also had to go to military court for friendly fire. If it were the marines the story should have been a lot longer. I give this movie a 5 out of 10. It could have been longer and showed a little more in depth into the war,5,0,1,18 November 2006
Saw III," Perfect Pshycological Trilogy
","Well, after watching Saw 1 and 2 I was really looking forward to Saw 3, which as far as i am concerned was gonna live up to my hope.I can promise you one thing this movie is just like Saw 1 and has everything and loads more of gore than Saw 1 & 2 and is an extremely smart movie that is underrated.They put a closing chapter to this first trilogy perfectly.The acting particularly is good, but its the story and the plot that is extremely well written and of course the Twists again are just as good as the first 2 are huge and much more enthralling and shocking! This movie is a reminder of Saw 1 and 2 and really sets the tone for more Saw movies to come i would be heartbroken if this Saw series ends here because its getting interesting with each part.I give this movie a 9 out of 10 for not being just an average horror trilogy",9,3,4,12 December 2006
Remember the Titans," A feel good story..
","This is by far my favorite movie in history. This is the story of two races from two different places putting there differences aside and binding through the great story of football. Even what the parents and the town people told them they would not listen as friendship was to great for them. This movie is feel good with the music to the team comedy. It shows every aspect of racial differences, and how where not all that different. Denzel Washington gives off a breathtaking performance as the coach who never quits and Will Patton who gives up his life long dream to be in the hall of fame to see his team shine. It is a great story of team-work, and should never be forgotten. I give this movie a 10/10. It is the greatest football story ever portrayed.",10,1,2,7 December 2006
Saving Private Ryan," Greatest war story ever told on screen!
",This movie defined the modern definition of the war movie. It was told through the eyes of if not the greatest director in our history(Spielberg) It is played out perfectly by Tom Hanks who I was not a big fan of till I seen this movie. Everything seems so real and is as if you are there with the soldiers fighting for your country. This is by far the greatest war movie ever played out. Everyone played there spot to perfection and acted the best they could. i think the story is very precise . The first 10 minutes of the movie are shocking yet a cinematic masterpiece. Every minute is breathtaking and shows you the horrors of war and friendship. An how one name determined them to save him. It is a story of teamwork and what they did to help each other out. I give this movie an 11 out of 10.,10,1,4,23 November 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Truly my Favorite out of the 3
","I still find this my favorite one even though Peter Jackson himself has admitted The Two Towers was the hardest part of the trilogy to achieve, at least in terms of narrative structure since, unlike The Fellowship of the Ring, it has no proper beginning and no emotionally packed climax (Boromir's death in Fellowship was one of that film's most moving moments).Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) continue their journey to Mordor in order to destroy the One Ring, and find an unexpected guide in that item's previous owner, vicious creature Gollum (Andy Serkis); Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) reunite with the reborn Gandalf (Ian Mckellen) to save the dying kingdom of Rohan from Saruman's (Christopher Lee) evil clutch; Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) have a close encounter with the Ents, ancient creatures which have unfinished business with a certain bad wizard.Helm's Deep aside, the movie's most remarkable element is the mad, schizophrenic Gollum. He's got 'ambiguity' and 'unreliability' written all over him, as we see him struggle with his two persons, one the good fella he once was, the other a filthy, treacherous freak who wants nothing more than his 'preccciousssss' back (the conversation between the two personalities is one of the most beautiful scenes ever made). He makes us suspicious about his most insignificant gesture, and has us thinking the worst may happen in The Return of the King.Not as good as the previous part (at least the theatrical version, which I rate 9/10), but still a really good fantasy movie, and one of the best pictures of 2002.",10,1,3,10 December 2006
Schindler's List," A story of true heart Speilbergs epic..
",This movie depicts the Jews fight to stay alive and showed what they really went through. It shows the story of one man who could change heart with the views of what happened during those years and why it happened. That will always be a question why. Steven Spielberg hits the movie rite on the spot and makes you feel as if your there. He brings it a ll back to life. Everyone gave off amazing performances. This is Spielberg's arguably greatest achievement other then Saving Private Ryan. At the end it makes you feel a little good inside to know what Oskar Schindler did for the Jews. This movie deserves all the Oscars it one and more I think this is one of the most amazing story's ever told on screen by one of the greatest directors ever to hit the big screen. I give it a 15 out of 10.,10,9,13,22 November 2006
Men in Black II," Not the best but good
","This movie was pretty good, all in all. It had a lot of funny jokes. I think it was mostly geared toward younger people. But a few were funny.I don't want to spoil it for anyone, so I'm just going to write in general terms.One of gags in this movie was so hilarious, it canceled out all of the bad jokes and somewhat weak storyline, and turned it into a wholly positive experience for me.I'm still laughing, 2 weeks later! I am glad I suffered through all of the painful so-called humor, just to see that one scene.Instant classic! I found parts of the actual story difficult to follow. I don't think that's so important, if you can realize this movie for what it is. Harmless fun. 7 out of 10.",7,0,0,15 December 2006
Children of Men," Truly Amazing..
","I have to say, when i came out of the movie theater I was astonished. This movie was truly one of the greatest Sci-Fi movies I had seen in a long time. Children Of Men puts you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire movie with explosions around every turn, a new sequence of story. Julianne Moore played her part great as she usually does in Sci-Fi's such as The Forgotten. Charlie Hunnman played great for one of his first more serious roles. But we cannot forget about Clive Owens unforgettable performance in this great movie. This is truly the Blade Runner of this decade.The story line is excellent with great drama and great adventure through this futuristic setting. I found this movie truly great and i recommend it to anyone who likes sci-fi or if you want to see a great movie with great actors and great directing by the talented Alfonso Cuarón. If you miss this movie you miss an unforgettable experience. I give this movie a 9 out of 10.",9,2,6,4 January 2007
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Tarentino is that good
","Quentin Tarantino is a legend in film making. The first time I saw Kill Bill i knew it would be good. I didn't expect this movie to be as good as his previous movies, but personally I think he perfected his film making. It is simply the most entertaining movie a director can make. The action, the comedy, the thrills, the action & the action. They all add up to one of the best movies ever created. Some of the scenes in Kill Bill never seize to amaze me. How Tarantino came up with the ideas for some camera angles & movements is beyond me. All throughout the movie are little ideas probably created on set which make the film even more enjoyable The acting was great. Uma Thurman holds the movie on her shoulders, along with Tarantino.The rest of the actors do a great job, I loved every performance.",8,2,6,11 December 2006
Saw II," Just as good as the 1st...
","Like the title states, this film was both gory and psychologically terrifying which seems to be a rare situation for the horror/thriller genre nowadays. I saw it the 1st day it came out knowing it would be a very smart thriller. and I am pleased to say that this movie has been added to my short list of 'Sequels Better or Just As Good As the Original'.This movie will have you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. It will leave you haunted for at least the rest of the night with a heightened fear of being in enclosed areas.I knew there was going to be a big twist at the end but I couldn't foresee what it was going to be...be prepared to be surprised.It has no holes and is perfectly put together and Saw is just acted out perfect.I recommend this to anyone who is up for a smart thriller.",9,0,1,12 December 2006
Black Hawk Down," One of the Best..
","Black Hawk is quite simply the best movie of the year (2001) and one of best war movies I have seen. It's an astonishing achievement that puts you right in the middle of the hellish horror faced by U.S. soldiers in Somalia in 1993. Every explosion startled me and filled me with fear, every gunshot felt like it was whizzing right by me, every mistake or unforeseen event had me on the edge of my seat with stress and anger. I felt as though I had been transported to Mogadishu for 2.5 hours and plopped in the middle of the ambush faced by the 100 or so U.S. Rangers and Delta Force Troops as they set about to capture a Somalian warlord responsible for stealing Red Cross food shipments in his starvation-ravaged country. I really felt this movie, it was tangible to me; the confusion, the fear, the sense of dislocation and horror the soldiers must have faced. At the end I was emotionally and mentally drained.All emotions, a subject of much debate where this movie is concerned, at least among some critics. While the reviews for Black Hawk Down have on average ranged from 'Good to Excellent,' there has been persistent and growing criticism over the lack of clearly drawn out characters that the audience could connect with, the lack of historical context, and the fact that movie is all action, with no heart, with no point-of-view. Well I think those who criticize the movie on these grounds, have completely missed the point of the movie, and are flat-out wrong. It is a movie told from the soldiers point-of-view, pure and simple. This is not a political movie, this is not a movie that needs cheap sentimentality or conventional emotional 'hooks' for the characters. As much as I liked Saving Private Ryan, the overly sentimental framing device used by Spielberg, really annoyed me. It felt like he was pandering to the audience just a little bit, and it wasn't necessary. Well, there's no pandering here, no cheap sentimentality in Black Hawk Down, just the horrible, gruesome, disorienting reality of modern combat. I didn't know anyone who worked in the World Trade Center, but I was moved to tears by what happened to them on Sept. 11 and that's the way I felt today in the movie.As far as I am concerned there was plenty of emotion in Black Hawk Down, plenty of 'choke-up' moments, or moments when I was moved by the unbelievable courage shown by the soldiers as they faced an almost hopeless situation. I'm not sure how anyone could not be moved by seeing these 18-25 year-old men trapped in the horror of a Civil War that had no bearing on U.S. National Security. As portrayed by the amazing ensemble cast, these men (really boys in many cases) showed the full range of emotions that our soldiers must have gone through, not to mention the fear and confusion of their situation. To me the cast standouts were Josh Hartnett (boy has he got BIG FUTURE STAR written all over him) as Staff Sgt Eversmann and Australian actor Eric Bana as Sgt 1st Class 'Hoot.' Black Hawk Down is a great movie, and it is an important movie. It is the story of courage and heroism against nearly insurmountable odds. What happened in Somalia was a foreign policy failure for the U.S., but the actions of the soldiers sent into battle that October day were anything but failure. .",10,3,6,12 December 2006
Toy Story," A new mark in history..
",This movie was truly amazing the first time I seen it. It is a truly captivating picture. It was the 1st 3D movie of its time and brought many kids to see it. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen just made the movie even better with the toy that didn't want to let go and his owner to like the new toy on the block. It is very touching and as a kid I could not get enough of this movie. I can watch about 10 times in a row and mostly anyone else can. It will stay with me forever so i recommend this movie to anyone who wants there kids to watch or if you just want to watch a great family movie thats fun for every one. I give this movie an outstanding 10 out of 10.,10,0,0,10 December 2006
Blood Diamond," DiCaprio Scores Again...
","DiCaprio scores again in this great drama about what money can do to a man. DiCaprio has been on fire with working with Martin Scorsese in The Aviator and The Departed. Now he hits again in this instant classic about a stone worth more then friendship,family,love, and even death. The business men are doing anything to get there hands on it and the smuggler played by DiCaprio(who uses a perfect accent for this movie) will not let it go but until it is obtained by a farmer played by Djimon Hounsou a great person for the character. Now as his family is taking away DiCaprio opens his heart and knows that he must put his greed behind them so they can both have a new start. They begin a journey to obtain a stone and must overcome enemy's and become friends in the process. It is a great thriller with plenty of action and the music is superb. It will keep you in your seats from beginning to end. It has a great story along with a perfect plot. I recommend this movie for anyone looking to see a good thriller.

Street cop Will Smith seems an unlikely contender to join this very special service and help K battle illegal aliens.Barry Sonnenfeld's experience as a cinematographer put him in good stead for planning this quirky fun sci-fi comedy.Men in Black is given life by Sonnenfeld's shot-choices, for greatest comic effect, terrific fun musical score by Danny Elfman, and two perfectly cast actors: Tommy Lee Jones' wry delivery and Will Smith's comic persona make for a movie with some real personality.Vincent D'Onofrio is a memorable bad guy - especially when we don't have to look at his regular face.A few death scenes will be too gruesome for kiddies, but once they're a certain age its bound to be one of their favorite movies. Such terrific imaginative fun.10/10",9,1,2,15 December 2006
Saw," A New Franchise is Born
","Saw is nothing like Horror movies today,why do I say that because it has a good moral 'appreciate your life' and it is absolutely brilliant.The story:Two men wake up at opposite sides of a dirty, disused bathroom, chained by their ankles to pipes. Between them lies a dead man loosely clutching a hand-held tape player and a handgun. Each finds a tape the perfect fit for the player in their back pocket. They play the tapes. One is threatened, the other isn't. But they have a task: One must kill the other by 6:00, or his wife and daughter will die. They find hacksaws in a toilet, and try to cut the chains, but it doesn't work. They are the two newest victims of the Jigsaw Killer. In a flashback, we learn of Amanda, a girl who falls victim to the Jigsaw Killer. On her head is a mask, which is hooked into her lower jaw. There is a timer on it. Only one key will unlock it, and that key is in the digestive tract of her cell mate who lies paralyzed on the opposite side of the room. If she doesn't unlock the mask in time, her lower jaw will be ripped wide open. She survives, but her cell mate doesn't.Through a series of flashbacks, we learn of more victims, and of the nearly-successful capture of the Jigsaw Killer, who doesn't actually kill his victims. Instead, he finds ways to make them kill either themselves, or each other, and he thinks the entire 'game' out perfectly, with no other ways out. Or so it would seem.Saw is one of those movies that leave you thinking in the end.Saw does not have much blood there are a few gruesome scenes,but otherwise that's it.The acting was well done,I really liked Leigh Whannels performance.The directing was surprisingly good,James Wan is a great director.The story is well written and done.Overall one hell of a twisted and brilliant Horror flick with a good lesson.",9,0,1,12 December 2006
Reservoir Dogs," Tarantinos career setter...
","This was the first great hit by one of the greatest directors in our history Quentin Tarantino. The story of this movie is always fast pace and does not leave out any information. It is so stylish and the acting is brilliant. It brings us to a garage knowing nothing by the end you cant consume it all. The origins of the characters were completely brilliant and gave there personality to them. Most of them were cocky but under the pressure could turn heads. This movie had violence,story,character,mobsters,and anything that a great movie should have and was put together almost perfect. I give this movie a 9 out of 10 on a brilliant piece of work.",9,0,1,22 November 2006
Rocky," A true underdog story
","This is truly an all American excellent movie! To know that this production was not only in on film, but also in real life, a 'win or lose' project for the then unknown Sylvester Stallone only makes this film more lovable. It tells the story of a unknown prize fighter who doesn't really have a life worth envying. Suddenly he gets his big chance when the world champion seeks a new challenger, as the challenger he had has to bail out, due to an injury. Rocky goes for it, but in the end he knows he's not in the same league as the champ. The true victory is Rocky's new gains self respect and love for his girlfriend Adrian. This film has a really cool 70's vibe and for me the locations use (Philadelphia) fit the film perfect. It was filmed during winter 1976 and that's something you can actually see. The true realism and great acting performances (plus the unforgettable soundtrack) makes this a film worthwhile. A must see definitely!! My favorite scene is still the one where Rocky goes out for his first morning run. He gets up at 4 A.M. and sets out into the cold, frozen streets of morning hour Philadelphia.

Pulp Fiction," All Hail Pulp Fiction
","Pulp Fiction is one of the greatest crime stories ever told on screen and portrayed by great actor including Travolta and Jackson. This movie had high expectations after Reservoir Dogs. It did not only live up to those expectations but went above and beyond. It is told by one of the greatest directors of our history with a stylish and violent twist that everyone likes in a while. This movie has everything a perfect movie should have, guns, death, betrayal, and love. This movie keep me pumped the whole way down the road. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes a violent and a great story with excellent attitude. It could not have done any better then it was I give this movie a 10 out of 10.",9,2,5,23 November 2006
Titanic," A Movie People Love to Hate...
","When I first seen this movie I loved it from beginning to end. I mean it was simply beautiful. The effects were amazing, the acting was great, and the story was excellent. So I don't see why so many people hate this movie. It racked up 11 Oscars for a reason. A lot of people do not like the love story put into this tragic event almost a century ago. Hello people without the love story it would just be another documentary in this tragic event. I thought the story played perfect in with a movie of this caliber. It also had comic relief from what it was about to lead up to from Molly Brown(Kathy Bates). Also the great stories by the ever so hated Jack who was played perfectly by Leonardo DiCaprio who has become a icon playing parts such as The Aviator and The Departed. Also we cannot forget about Rose DeWitt Bukater his love played by Kate Winslet. These to had perfect chemistry throughout the entire movie and made it as sad as it was to become. I think the love story and all around them brought this story more into vision to people about how sad that tragic day really was.In this movie there were also great special effects supplied by Robert Legato, Mark A. Lasoff, Thomas L. Fisher Michael Kanfer who won the Academy Awards for best special effects, and did they deserve it. From the beginning where the boat was at the dock under the sun, or when it road freely through the night or even the sad climatic sinking of the ship, it was all put together so great. The cinematography in this movie was also greatly produced by Russell Carpenter who gathered in Academy Award for cinematography. We cant forget about Gloria Stuart who played the older Rose perfectly and told the story as if there were no flaws as if we couldn't help but believe the love between her and Jack that was tragically ended. This movie deserved every Award it won from music which was great to best sound to best art which was extremely excellent in this movie.I think James Cameron deserves every award he won for putting together this masterpiece in a simply magnificent form. He took a tragic event and put it into so many peoples minds for the rest of there lives. He was even able to include a protagonist and antagonist in an event like this. I don't know how you could not like this movie. In the effects and acting column it has Peter Jackson proportions. Every scene is beautiful and amazing. If you have never seen this movie don't judge it and just bye it. I recommend this movie for anyone who is up for an amazing performance and a great love story. I give this movie a 10 out of 10.",10,0,3,22 December 2006
Mystic River," Tuly a masterpiece
","This is a movie about the boundaries between love and friendship. I am a great fan of the book, but what Clint Eastwood did is utterly magnificent. He took a great story and turned it into an even better movie. You will be in tears at the end after all the great acting. It is a story of longtime friends who have now found different lives but get twisted in one sick circle of love, betrayal, and compromising differences. This is one of Sean Penn's greatest achievements on film. Clint picked a perfect story, a perfect cast of characters and turned this in to one outstanding movie. I would have to say this is Eastwood's greatest achievement on film never the less that Million Dollar Baby gathered the critics and Oscars, I still see this movie as captivating. I give this movie a definite 10 out of 10. And the best of its year.",10,0,2,10 December 2006
The Departed," Scorsese Does It Again
","Scorsese taking a good movie and turning it into a cinematic masterpiece that will always stay with us. Lots of people did not enjoy the movie because it felt as if it were dragging which i believe is completely wrong. The movie didn't drag, allot of people thought the movie should have ended after Frank Costello got shot. The point of the movie was that there was a rat in the mob helping the cops and a rat in the cops. So now we had to find out what was going to happen. the story is pretty much based on the inner man giving info to the enemy(rat). I think this was portrayed in beautiful fashion with an all star lineup including Mark Wahlberg,Jack Nicholson at his best, and Matt Damon maybe one of his greatest career moves. I thought this movie was excellent another great hit from a hall of fame director Martin Scorsese. 10 out of 10.",10,3,6,22 November 2006
Die Hard," A nobody put into the best action film of our time...
",This has got to be without a doubt the greatest modern action film ever. It is the story of a New York cop John McClane having trouble with his relationship and finding him self in even deeper trouble with some terrorist who decided to take over the Nakatomi Plaza. There is Hans Gruber the leader who talks in a smart fashion but is actually not as smart as he thinks he is. And then there is Sgt. Powell the ever so cheery cop trying to help out McClane. It is an all star cast line up. Bruce Willis one of our most beloved actors could not have played this part any better. He had the New York comedy we expected him to have. No one knew who Willis was until he took this part and played it perfectly. There is a lot of action. A lot of cop talk and every scene just gets better. I recommend this to anyone who likes an action film and a good laugh with lots of intelligence. i give this movie a 10 out of 10.,10,2,3,10 December 2006
Ice Age," Great Fun
","'Ice Age' is a lot of fun! It's laugh out loud funny, even though it's not 'Shrek' or 'Chicken Run' but it's definitely entertaining for adults, including shots like a passing reference to 'The X Files' movie and showing why the dodo became extinct.Sure it sticks with Disney-established cartoon clichÃ©s of orphaned kid, wisecracking side-animal and nature that's scary and dangerous.But the odd trio of stand-up comics with thick New York accents of Ray Romano, Denis Leary and John Leguizamo work really well off each other.I didn't recognize the voice of Goran Visnjic from 'E.R.' as the villain.I was disappointed that they didn't bother to do any original songs, just a recap of the old Rusted Roots song 'Send Me On My Way,' though that does happen to be a favorite of mine.8 out of 10.",8,0,0,15 December 2006
Con Air," Another Cage Winner
","Con Air can best be as The Rock in the sky. The film deals with a Gulf War veteran (Nicolas Cage) who becomes a victim of circumstance and is sentenced to eight years in prison. He is going home via a gigantic prison plane which is also carrying some very unsavory characters (John Malkovich, Ving Rhames, and Steve Buscemi among others). Of course the evil prisoners take over the plane and it is up to Cage to save the day. Overall this is a fine action film which keeps its focus on the characters. 10 out of 10. I found this movie enjoyable to the finest. And Nicholas Cage on of our greatest actors of our time. If you want action and criminals this is the movie to see",8,0,1,10 December 2006
The Shawshank Redemption," Feel Like Your There
","The Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen. Similar to The Green Mile in many respects (and better than it in almost all of them), these two movies have shown us that Stephen King is a master not only of horror but also of prose that shakes the soul and moves the heart. The plot is amazing, but King did great things with it in his novella that are only furthered by the direction, and the acting is so top-rate it's almost scary.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufrane, wrongly imprisoned for 20 years for the murder of his wife. The story focuses on Andy's relationship with 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman, in probably his best role) and his attempts to escape from Shawshank. Bob Gunton is positively evil and frightening as Warden Norton, and there are great performances and cameos all around; the most prominent one being Gil Bellows (late as Billy of Ally McBeal) as Tommy, a fellow inmate of Andy's who suffers under the iron will of Norton.If you haven't seen this movie, GO AND RENT IT NOW. You will not be disappointed. It is positively the best movie of the '90's, and one of my favorite of all time. This movie is a spectacle to move the mind, soul, and heart. 10/10",9,0,0,12 December 2006
Raging Bull," Stunningly amazing..
",This movie shot both Martin Scorsese and DeNiro to stardom as being one of the most beloved movies of all time. Its is the story of Jake Lamotta a boxer who had a bad outside life. It seems as if portrayed perfect in a sense that it could be greater then Rocky. It is anyones opinion. But from all aspects this movie is truly amazing and a beloved of our time. It is almost perfect and is the alliance of DeNiro and Pesci to unbelievable actors and coming from one of the greatest directors of all time. I will never forget this movie.I give this movie an amazing 10 out 10. A Martin Scorsese classic and just the dawn of his stardom.,10,1,2,22 November 2006
Casino Royale," Maybe the best Bond..
","This could in fact be the best Bond ever made. It is stylish, sexy, intelligent,and fast pace. Its got better gadgets then ever and the action just keeps getting better. Daniel Craig could in fact be the best actor since Connery. He portrays bond perfectly with the elegant talk and the sexy remarks and never scared for some good old fashion fights. This story has I think one of the best storyline out of all 21. Every body plays there part perfect rite until the very end. Even the bad guys were good in this one, the way they put it together from calm to action just made this movie ten time better then it might have been. I give this movie a 10 out of 10 for being maybe one of the best Bonds yet",9,0,2,12 December 2006
The Sixth Sense," A Twist Like no other
","This is an incredibly powerful film. Awash with emotion but never stooping to sentimentality this is the story of one frightened little boy you will never forget. All your worst childhood nightmares: the noises in the attic, the intruder in your house, that cold breath that makes your hair stand on end are here and then some.Bruce Willis gives one of the best performances of his career as the child psychologist trying to get himself back on track after a violent encounter with a former patient and it would be a crime if Haley Joel Osment were overlooked at coming awards ceremonies for his powerful performance here. It has been a long time since a child actor displayed such maturity in a role. Cole's innocent little face hidden behind his absent father's large-framed spectacles betrays a child coming to terms with a terrifying secret in the only way he can.You don't need to go and see this film again to realize why the end is such a surprise but you will rush out to watch it again purely because it's an almost perfect example of it's genre.It is a near perfect 8 out of 10.",8,2,3,12 December 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Good but not the best
","The long-awaited finale to the biggest movie franchise of the last two decades culminates in yet another excellent installment that more than delivers on its unending critical and commercial hype. 'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King' starts off right where the second film of the trilogy ('The Two Towers') finished. Two brave hobbits (Elijah Wood and Sean Astin) are nearing their final destination to destroy the most powerful ring of Middle Earth with the help of a crazed creature (played by Andy Serkis in a computer-generation mode) who continues to be the poster child for cinematic mood swings and psychiatric shortcomings. The ring has of course run Serkis mad and it remains unclear if the deranged beast will help or hinder in the end. Meanwhile the final battles for the vast landscape that is the franchise forms with Viggo Mortensen.Finally taking his rightful place as the king in spite of the fact that steward ruler John Noble has pretty much lost all sense of realism and sanity. He is distraught over the loss of his son (Sean Bean from the first film) and treats his other son (David Wenham) as a second-rate citizen. Of course Ian McKellen, Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies remain near Mortensen's side as the clock ticks to a possible Armageddon. Meanwhile hobbits Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan have also reunited with Mortensen and the other aforementioned players, but once again it appears that their hearts may get in the way of their somewhat limited brain-power. As all this goes on Miranda Otto and uncle Bernard Hill also ready to help their allies in the war. The love story between Mortensen and Liv Tyler gets some key air-time as she chooses to give up her immortality for a chance to be with Mortensen. Tyler gets into a dilemma waiting for Mortensen just as father Hugo Weaving had foreseen. By the close of the film (and ultimately the series) the various story-lines all finally come together and we get to see what happens to each of these near legendary characters. 'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King' fits in really well with the first two installments, but the only complaint I had (and this is a relatively small shortcoming) was the somewhat difficult ending. Co-writer/director Peter Jackson just did not really seem to know how to end the movie so he used up lots of time (approximately 20 minutes) to carefully give homage and consideration to all his key players. All this neared an interminable state as the production runs a mind-blowing 200 minutes when 175 would have likely been more sufficient. Who can blame Jackson for a little indulgence with J.R.R. Tolkien's landmark novels though? A wonderful three-ring balancing act makes the whole series well worth the time, money and effort for all involved. Still not as good a trilogy as 'The Godfather' group of films, but really 'The Lord of the Rings' was everything it was supposed to be and so much more. 4.5 out of 5 stars.",9,0,3,10 December 2006
Casino," One of the greatest stories to be underrated...
",This movie deserves more then it is given a lot of people call it an under achievement for Scorsese but i think other wise. The story of this movie is beautiful and is portrayed by DeNiro and Pesci at there best. It could not have been any better then it was. The first time I seen this movie I was amazed at how good they captures the world of Vegas and the underworld of Vegas. It is told through the eyes of great performers to give you the great reality of the movie and a great feel to the concept of staying at the top and what people would do to keep that throne. I see this as another masterpiece and a classic that should go down in history as one of the greatest cinematic achievements yet. I give this movie a 9 out of 10.,10,2,4,22 November 2006
Heat," A clash of two great characters...
",When you take two great actors such as De Niro and Pacino your bound to get a great movie like Heat. This movie keeps your heart beat up till the very end. The acting is superb. Pacino the cop looking to score big against the money criminals. But De Niro is a lot smarter then he thinks being on the other side of this crime chase. He plays his character perfect with the full emotion needed to have a great story-line and a great character in this well made crime drama. Two great actors clash in a crazy story of good vs. evil. It is a perfect picture of the 90s. This movie is De Niro at his best along with Pacino actually playing a good guy. I give this movie a 10 out of 10,10,2,4,10 December 2006
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A great success..
","Star Wars was the film that changed cinema forever. It had everything, brilliant special effects, a scary villain, fully built set pieces that you had never seen before, a brilliant music score from John Williams and likable characters in Han Solo and Obi-wan Kenobi well played by Harrison Ford and Alec Guinness. It was a film that had blazing action from start to finish, it was a film that the writer and director George Lucas had intended for children, his target audience was twelve and under, but it became a true mega blockbuster and people of all ages came again and again, dragging their friends with them.My favorite scenes include the opening sequence: the massive imperial Star Destroyer roaring over the screen attacking the fleeing rebel cruiser, that scene is mind-blowing on a cinema screen, i love the introduction of Darth Vader emerging from the smoke of the laser battle between the Stormtroopers and the Rebels, i also like the way Vader is established as an evil killer right away when he crushes the neck of some poor hapless rebel prisoner holding him up with one hand and throwing him to the side like a rag doll, this gives Vader's character a sense of malevolence from the kickoff.Luke sees Obi-wan's plight, Obi-wan smiles at Vader, he raises his saber and closes his eyes, Vader strikes as look screams 'NO!' and John Williams score swells with tragic loss as Luke blasts away at the Stormtroopers. Its the one scene that sticks in my mind about A New Hope, that isn't special effects.The final aerial assault between TIE fighters and X-wing fighters over the Death Star is perhaps the most exciting finale of any movie. It was captivating and simply amazing when first performed. Even someone not a fan of Star Wars could not have liked that scene.",9,1,2,10 December 2006
Sin City," Crime portrayed amazing..
","Watching the legend of a comic book come alive right in front of my eyes was something that I wasn't truly ready for. I had supposedly shunned away from the hype of Frank Millers dark cliché' being made into cine-art.I was none the less amazed in wonder as three stories of redemption jumped, pulsated, and then steamed up my TV when watching the DVD after succumbing to the advertising allure at the Best Buy, or was it Tower Records. The signs that should have been obvious to me are now blurred into a world where the dames deserve better than this two bit hooker life and I should have known better. Without my medicine, it's too hard to know what's real anymore. Do the people that I'm killing on the way to the truth really deserve it? Or have I become what they said I would, A homicidal murderer...So goes the over the top, comic book inner-dialog of each of our three heroes. The these long black and white vignettes are secondary to the eye candy of of the shady side of town world amazingly re-created by directors Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez. The story is about the town itself, Basin City where hope was replaced long ago by survival. There is little color in this town and in this film, so when color takes over scenes, as in the opening of red lips and green eyes, you know it's to be savored.Oh yeah... a dark film with dark characters. None of which needs explaining. To put in chronological order would be a waste. What's the point? Bruce Willis as a dying cop with a bum ticker, trying to save a girl who might already be dead. Mickey Roark as the super-anti-super-hero Marv who's out to die for the murder of a beautiful call girl whose murder was pinned on him. Then there is Clive Owen, the pretty tough boy on display, caught between all worlds. Benicio Del Toro again steps into a character and you can't figure out",10,0,1,10 December 2006
The Pursuit of Happyness," Definitely for the family
","This is a great movie from story to acting. Will Smith puts on one of his best performances on screen, playing the try so hard t fulfill his dream Chris Gardner. Also his son and real life son Jaden Smith puts on an excellent performance along side his dad. All the acting is superb, but its the story that is truly wonderful, a man that had nothing puts his son before anything even being homeless, he tries to find a job with his smarts. It all starts with the man yelling to him from his car finds Will Smith in a predicament realizing his IQ could help him find a job in one of the largest companies in the world. When he walks in with no shirt on the men ask him 'if a man walked in with no shirt on what would you say'Smith' He must have been wearing some nice pants.Overall it is a heartwarming movie, about care, drive to fulfill your dream and to give it your all. The whole family will enjoy it and once you leave the theater you are going to feel so good inside. I recommend it to anyone who wants to see it as it is one of the best so far this year. I give it a 7 out of 10.",7,1,3,23 December 2006
Goodfellas," Scorseses Greatest Achievement
",This is Martin Scorsese's greatest movie ever played on screen. Of course it is often compared to Raging Bull which is also another great cinematic masterpiece but no where close to Good Fellas which is the definitive mobster movie of the 90s and all time. Robert DeNiro gives off his greatest performance but we shouldn't put all our eyes on DeNiro as Ray Liotta is the king of this movie showing what its like to become a mobster and go through changes and how you don't just turn to a man but inside you change. It is perfect in story wise. But lets not forget about Pesci where could it be without Pesci the hard headed mobster who never wants to be punked around. All around this was a great achievement and in my books is one of the greatest movies ever told on screen.10 out 10.,10,0,1,22 November 2006
The Godfather," Breathtaking although not the greatest mob film
","This movie had me speechless by the end. In this movies there are no errors,no mistakes, everything is perfection. It is perfect in every aspect of the movie. It boosted Pacino to stardom along with a Dog Day Afternoon. It is Francis Ford Copollas greatest classic alongside Apocalypse now. This movie has a great story line and shows what its really like to be in a mob family down to the very last detail. No part of this movie is wrong and the views of the mob are correctly viewed. This movie is an all-time classic. I would not consider it the greatest mobster movie as i feel Good Fellas is but it is perfect and could not have been done better by a perfect director. I give this movie an amazing 10 out of 10.",10,0,1,22 November 2006
