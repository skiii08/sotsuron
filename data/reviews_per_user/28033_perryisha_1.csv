It," What's up with all the positive reviews?
","I saw the 88% positive rating. I experienced the hype that came with the trailer. I felt the potential of its scary premise. And what do I get when I sit my ass down in the movie theatre? A massive frikin disappointment. But let's talk about the redeemable qualities of this piece of crap film first. The opening shots were sexy as hell. The cinematography throughout the rest of the movie was great as well. The child actors were really good at portraying their characters, and made their relationships feel real. Other than that there is no other redeemable quality. :)IT relies 98.9% on jump-scares. And i'm not talking about good jump-scares. You can always predict what'll happen and clearly identify the director's formula of 'horror' after the 58th tHAT'S RIGHT FIFTY EIGHTH jump-scare. To be fair, the most disturbing part is the film's over-reliance on gross CG whose sole purpose is just to make you feel grossed out. It substitutes the time it takes to build up true horror by just smacking some CG accompanied by a sharp violin sound in your face. To sum it up, it looks scary but isn't scary. I also felt that the movie doesn't know what it wants to be. An example of this is the first arch where the scene is so serene and peaceful, oh look its even raining outside how cozy! Then less than 2 minutes later its like the film suddenly realized 'oh yeah lol i'm a horror' and almost completely, without any warning or build up whatsoever, every element of the scene just suddenly transitions into this dark, fearsome and overbearing experience. It just feels forced, repetitive and inauthentic. The characters were very likable, yes, but also incredibly stupid according to the overused stereotypes of the just-plain-asking-for-it-you're-not-even-trying-bro horror film characters. Honestly, save your time and don't watch this in theatres. If you're really curious just wait for the hype to die down and then watch it online. I know I personally regret the 2.5 hours i've spent on this terrible excuse of a horror film.",2,6,14,14 September 2017
