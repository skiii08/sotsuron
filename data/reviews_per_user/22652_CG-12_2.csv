Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I am not disappointed
","I am a Star Wars fan so, when i went watching this movie, i was totally certain that i wouldn´t be disappointed. And i wasn´t. The movie is a bit unlike than the others. Jar Jar Binks, for example, was funny sometimes but he didn´t fit into Star Wars that much. The Jedis, Obi Wan and Qui Gon were good, although Obi Wans character could have been better especially as Ewan McGregor is a great actor. But the movie is great. All the special effects are done with incredible detail. Most of all i like the final fight between Darth Maul and the Jedi´s, beacuse it´s so great coreographed. Another great scene is the pod race. Very entertaining and it´s also a good example why movies are best at cinemas. 9 of 10",9,18,26,21 September 1999
The Matrix," Excellent!
","This is probably the best movie in 1999! The big shootout is excellent, and the fight scenes are great. It's got a intresting plot/story too. The actors do a good job and agent Smith is 1999 years best 'bad guy'! Overall the best action/sci fi i've ever seen! (And much better than Star Wars Episode 1!)",10,0,0,14 January 2000
