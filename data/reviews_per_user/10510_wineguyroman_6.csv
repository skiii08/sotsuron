The Blair Witch Project," At least i didnt pay money to see this film
","I saw this film after hearing all the hype, both positive and negative. Perhaps because i watched the film in the comfort of my living room, on video, that this film didnt have the desired effect of being scary (or perhaps because it was a very poorly made film.)Whatever the reasons, i found BWP to be one of the worst films i have ever seen (and I'm not prone to hyperbole).*mini spoiler* The idea of college aged kids getting lost in the woods with a STREAM nearby is completely implausible (Follow the stream, you morons). And intentionally losing the map, the ONE source of information, left me with a feeling that they all truly deserved whatever fate befell them and that the human race would be a slightly better place without them contributing those defective genes to the gene pool.Additionally, i found the characters to be annoying, argumentative and having few redeeming qualities. PET PEEVE - WIPE YOUR NOSE !Initially i was going to rate this film a 2 because they did manage to make over 100 million dollars on this piece of tripe, which required a bit of marketing genius. But due to my love of true cinema, i couldn't justify any rating above 1",2,8,14,18 September 2001
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," About How people reacted to Borat...
","My comments aren't going to be about the movie itself but rather about how it offended so many people. Personally i thought the movie was hilarious and I will certainly see it again. I think the reason so many objected to this film was probably because it hit too close to home. Much in the same way someone that doesn't believe in evolution would consider such a theory completely garbage. Another thing i find interesting is that around 7,000 IMDb members gave this film a rating from 1 to 3 (with 4800+ giving it a a lowest possible rating of 1) So that means about 10% percent of everyone that voted on Borat (7000 out of 71,000) hated it but 482 out of 1040 (around half) of the people that hated it bothered to comment on it.The film is not for the masses. Because the masses are exactly the people that Borat is lampooning. Good Job Borat !",9,2,5,6 October 2007
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Hollywood still has what it takes to ruin a good story
","This commercialized piece of crap was a great example of how Hollywood takes something good (Terminator And Terminator 2) and exploits it all to hell.The idea of 'The Rise of the Machines' is a solid one. We have other examples in cinema of when the bad guys get their modicum of revenge (The Empire Strikes back, comes to mind) But this piece of tripe sullies the good name of the previous movies in the series. My life would be better if I somehow I didn't know this was ever made or ever existed. I would be quite happy with the Terminators movies only being T1 and T2. I'm not gonna blame the problems on the actors. They were essentially hamstrung by a weak script and trying to fill the shoes (and minds of people like me that knew how good it COULD be)Its such a shame. Someone should be sued.",3,0,2,16 May 2009
Transformers," You can tell who the target audience is
","and I'm not one of them. Transformers had impressive special effects. But the acting ws subpar and plot was written for a younger audience. Megan Fox's sweet bod was, in my opinion, the best part of the film (narrowly beating out the special effects) My roommate rented the video, so i paid exactly the right amount for it (nothing). Perhaps on the big screen the special effects would have been more captivating but i found myself glancing at the clock on the wall wondering how long the film was. I discovered it was 143 minutes long and I felt it was probably about 43 minutes too long. I can't believe that the entire story couldn't have been condensed at some points.Overall Transformers was an average film that had decent special effects to keep it from being a stinker. I give the Special Effects an 8 and the film as a whole a 4. Not good, not hideous and possibly better than anything i could have watched on TV tonight.Edit-After reviewing other comments, I realized that for many Transformers were part of childhood/growing up. I also remembered that in the 80's I was in high school and i was far more concerned with how to get into Tracy L's (I'll refrain from using her last name) pants than anything concerning toy robots. So I when into this film unbiased by childhood memories. ((Unlike when I watched the re-release of episode 4 (known as STAR WARS when I saw it back in 77-78)The trouble was that the kid that saw Star Wars was grown and the magic was lost in the tide of life)) Anyway, apparently lack lack of bias didn't help much, the film simply wasn't very good. At least I didn't feel part of my childhood memories were being violently tread upon (like others have implied). I also learned that a lot of the charm of the Transformers, the development of their personalities was apparently too (tedious? frivilous? unnecessary? expensive? useful? ) to be added to the movie. Shame.",5,2,7,30 October 2007
The Dark Knight," Dark Knight good but certainly not great.
","This was a good not great film. I rated it an 7. I've read many of the comments related to the film, both the folks that loved it and the folks that hated it. It was entertaining and I don't feel my movie money was wasted but I found it being rated #1 quite surprising. When i looked at the rating breakdown I noticed that the younger you were, the more you liked it (Those under 18 rated it an average of 9.6 which was the highest for any age range) But I guess that isn't surprising for a movie that was adapted from a comic book.(I really wish IMDb allowed for decimal points in the rating because then it would get a 7.5)",7,3,9,3 August 2008
Avatar," I find it very interesting...
","Interesting that the reactions of how many people consider this film an 'instant classic' and a groundbreaking film. And how there is a completely different camp of viewers that sees Avatar as merely a film with good special effects but a weak plot/storyline and a film that borrow ideas from other great films (such as 'dances with wolves' and 'the matrix').I'm also in the 'I can't believe people are so gaga about this movie.' camp. To be fair, i have to say i enjoyed the special effects. But in no way would I consider this a film that will stand the test of time (Like Star Wars, or Aliens, or The Matrix) I consider this a decent film that would seem awful plain (and not very good) without all the CGI. I rate Avatar a 7 because of its special effects but it only gets 2.5 for the story.",4,1,3,2 January 2010
