Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," This film lacks any redeeming value, definitely not for kids
","If you don't want to see something so disturbing that it should be in the 'adult' section of the DVD store, don't watch this film.There is nothing socially 'redeeming' about the film. The version on DVD distributed in Europe may have been worse than the U.S. version. Sometimes they release uncut versions here, so it's hard to know.Perverse, sick 'humor', racist 'humor', and pornographic 'humor'.Don't buy the hype. This film is not for kids. It's not for anyone with any sense of morality or any sense of humor.Don't make the same mistake I did and listen to someone tell you it's funny. It's not. It was a piece of junk with the production values of a bad TV show and complete lack of taste.",Null,2,4,26 June 2008
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Terrific use of imagination!
","Peter Jackson pulls off an amazing feat. It's very hard to satisfy fans of these wonderful fantasy books by J.R.R. Tolkien. Though not all fans will be perfectly satisfied (some details are changed for brevity or to help the movies move along, others are omitted), most fans were thrilled with this film.The characters are well developed, the scenery is beautiful and the musical score is outstanding, bringing the film to life. You actually feel you are going through this adventure with Frodo and Sam.What distinguishes this film and this series from other fantasy movies is that the script is based on an excellent story, not a comic book, television show or simply an action film with no plot, but lots of explosions. The director shows a love for the original story and uses his imagination (imagine that, in these days!) in his careful production of this story.Widely hailed as one of the best films ever made, it was just the introduction to the other stories! But what a great introduction. If you haven't yet seen it, check it out! Even if fantasy isn't your cup of tea, you can enjoy the music and scenery. :-)",Null,0,1,3 August 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Excellent sequel!
","Jackson continues the epic series with amazing battle sequences and wonderful new characters.  Who will forget Treebeard, Grima Wormtongue or Theoden, King of Rohan and of course Gollum!?!Added is the humor and rivalry between Gimli the dwarf and Legolas the elf.
Only drawback is that the ending of the first film contains a part of the second book and part of the Two Towers gets left for the third movie.  Other than that, this is a real great sequel that is somewhat overlooked in the trilogy.The character development is great as the fellowship breaks into three groups.  I think we can all identify with one of these characters and imagine what we would do given these circumstances.  Imagination.  That's the name of the game.  If you think it's not a valuable asset, ask Peter Jackson, who allowed himself to use imagination to make into a movie his favorite series of books from his youth.",Null,0,1,3 August 2004
Million Dollar Baby," Great acting, strange emphasis (spoilers within)
","Granted I haven't read the collection of short stories the 70 year old that wrote what this movie is based on did. Being that they were just that, short stories, I doubt that the entire film's materials was taken from just one of them.I found that this was a boxing movie that didn't focus much on boxing. They explained it by saying she won all her matches in the first round. Has there ever existed such a boxer? Not even Rocky was that good! The disappointment for me, however, doesn't come from the lack of boxing footage, but from the lack of story explanation. What happened between Eastwood's character and his wife? They divorced, separated or what? Why does his daughter hate him so? Why does Hollywood feel the need to continue to mock anyone of religious faith, including having the (Episcopal?) priest using bad language and calling Eastwood's character a liar for saying he was writing his daughter, when the audience is shown he was writing her and that his letters were returned.Why does he decide to murder her (assist her suicide) and take off? Where on earth was the hospital staff and why did no one hear the noise of the monitors while he was killing her? Supposedly a clue is dropped that he went to the diner that served lemon pie without it coming from the can, but why? Because he went against what the priest told him to do and felt that was the closest to heaven he could get after '2' unforgivable sins? A lot of questions, but not many answers. But then I guess that's what film making is about these days. Pathos above moral values. Emotions rather than any logical sequence or rhyme or reason.When Clint Eastwood was asked about why the assisted suicide scene in an interview, he stated that the movie wasn't making an argument for it. But it sure wasn't making one against it. It even seemed that Morgan Freeman's character looked at that decision as a good one as he wrote the letter to Eastwood's daughter.In a year full of weak movie entries (the fact that idiot Michael Moore even tried to get consideration for best picture showed that HE knew it was a weak field), this film was a cut above the other mediocrity, but it's lack of moral values and degradation of life and the importance of what God thinks brings this down to one of the most mediocre movies to receive as many Oscar nominations as it did that I can remember.See it by all means, but be prepared for disappointment if you are a person of faith or care about life.",Null,0,2,7 June 2005
Love Actually," Lust, actually
","Please don't make the mistake I did and check the film out hoping Liam Neeson and Emma Thomson might actually make up for Rowan Atkinson (who's Mr. Bean is at times funny, but his movies...not) and Hugh Grant, whom I have yet to see a film he's been in that I've enjoyed.I checked it out with the caveat that if it took a turn down the wrong path, I would simply stop watching.We have only IMDb or online to find out any info on films as the summaries in Czech seldom tell much and far too many, like this film, are not rated by the Czech board of film raters.The first 15 minutes or so were so replete with sexual jokes, references, homosexual jokes, lustful innuendos, a brother fornicating with his brother's wife (or girlfriend), and a 'singer' using like 6 profane words consecutively in one sentence plus an assistant to 'prime minister' Hugh Grant (UGHH!) who of course must proceed to use all kinds of bad language at the prime minister.It was enough for me. Thanks kindly to IMDb about the warning that the film also contained nudity. The title sounded interesting, the beginning showed promise of people hugging people goodbye at a train station, but it took a radically wrong turn.I think that the narrator got it wrong. Love was not all around. Even if he was meaning it to be humorous, the only 'love' that was all around in this movie was lust, actually. Which would have made a more fitting title.Avoid this film and don't buy into it being a family friendly film or romantic. It's like a British HBO movie where sex substitutes for love and lust substitutes for romance.",Null,2,5,6 August 2007
Hancock," Didn't live up to expectations
","After seeing the preview, I admit I was skeptical.BUT I read others said the preview wasn't really like the film. Coupled with the rare SECOND weekend boom the film had (probably due to competition it's first weekend didn't do well, but sure did phenomenally afterward), I thought it worth risking the rental.People who reviewed it said it 'wasn't a typical superhero film' ala Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Dark Knight, etc.I thought that would be good since my wife doesn't like those type films even if I like some of them (albeit there were parts in THIS year's superhero films I didn't like included either and put them in the category of not family films...all the sudden the comics I read as a kid are made in films that are for adults (or at least teens).So I went into Hancock with an open mindset. When Will Smith is clean, he is a funny comedian and he's made some interesting films in the past.However, we were both VERY disappointed with Hancock. The humor was NOT even close to funny and it got so disgusting that by the prison scene, we shut off the DVD and gave up.It was boring, not funny, full of bad language and a pension for repeating a particularly offensive word over and over, by children as well as adults.We gave it every opportunity to turn around, but it seemed to be a worse than average comic book character with the only twist is that he is a jerk with super powers that doesn't care what he acts like nor does he particularly care about the people he rescues nor their opinion.If all it intended was to make an anti-hero, I guess it was a success, but a watchable film that a family could watch or learn any lessons from (other than how not to talk and behave...not just the 'super hero', but the kids and adults shouldn't behave as the others in the film did either...), it did not deserve to be rewarded with financial success.To think they would consider a sequel is baffling. But then in this day and era where any film that makes decent money, sequels will be made until it makes nothing and ruins the franchise, I suppose they'll make sequels even worse than the original. (sort of like the sequels of Disney's 'Pirates of the Caribbean' or part 2&3 of 'Matrix').Crank out junk on the assembly line and someone is bound to buy a ticket, it seems. This year (perhaps due in part to last year's writer's strike) has been a real weak year in films.Hancock is a prime example, being one of the big selling pieces of junk.Maybe the car companies can take lessons from the film industry in how to sell a piece of junk and make people think it's something extra-ordinary. Then our tax dollars won't have to do it. :)",Null,1,9,18 December 2008
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," A Mind-blowing conclusion!
","What can you say after seeing perhaps the most brilliant climatic finish of all time!  Much less of a trilogy of movies.  I have friends who aren't into epic or long movies and who don't like 'serials'.  Still, they wanted to know how this one ended because the movies were well made and kept the audience's attention.This movie has not only epic battle scenes that exceed Two Towers, but has a personal touch that exceeds Fellowship of the Rings!  Sam becomes a real hero in this one.New characters include Boromir's brother Faramir, and their crazy father, the Stewart of Gondor. New tests of character for Eowyn, niece of the King of Gondor, Aragorn, the king about whom this story really is about, and Gandalf, Frodo, Sam, Pippin, Merry, Legolas, Gimli, Faramir and about everyone involved!
Perhaps a little long, still this movie was so good that the Oscars just couldn't ignore it any longer.  It's probable that some of it was accumulative and that some voters finally realized that a fantasy movie really could be serious competition for an Oscar award.  Compared to some of the other junk that they gave Oscars to instead of the first two movies (what they were nominated for), this series will far outlive them all.The first movie had the misfortune to run up against the year of the 'make up'.  In other words, Hollywood was doing a big 'I'm sorry' for all of the worthy folks they'd overlooked in the past for Oscars, regardless of whether this year was even THEIR best performance, much less whether it was better than FELLOWSHIP.  But the last year, the competition just couldn't stack up and they had no more excuses!Watch all three and have a blast!  I'm looking forward to seeing the extended versions of Two Towers and Return of the King also!",Null,0,2,3 August 2004
Shark Tale," Rated awful because of target audience
","Someone asked why the bad posts and ratings? Because this is an animated film that is supposed to be something to take kids to and instead is a tongue in cheek animated version of a mafia film like the 'R' rated 'Godfather' series. The language, sexuality, etc. is not appropriate for kids. Adults who may be a fan of this type of movie might find it a funny satire, but it is definitely not for kids and quite frankly, though not the worst in animation I've seen (that goes to 'The Last Unicorn'), message and content wise, it was one of the worst. The only reason we are even having this conversation is that some very talented actors lent their voice to it and thus caught ADULTS attention. Young kids don't even know Robert DeNiro was in Godfather or know that Peter Falk used to make movies with the Rat Pack. So it's not geared to kids, but it's marketed to them and THAT'S why people rated it low.",Null,7,11,18 June 2005
