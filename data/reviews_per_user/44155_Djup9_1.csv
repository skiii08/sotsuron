Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A Great Lucas film
",Hi!! all I saw the phantom menace today and my oppinion is this movie is wonderful 'it's a kick ass movie'. There are some disappointments but what tha heck nothing can be perfect not even a starwars film. It's all up to yourself how many expectations you have and so on. But all those critics that didn't like the movie or gave it very low grades must have been blind or something like that....I recommend this film to everyone it's very good... Go see it i promise you it's worth it..,10,0,0,31 May 1999
