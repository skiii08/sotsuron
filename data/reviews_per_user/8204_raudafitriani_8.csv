Ford v Ferrari," Entertaining racing movie that'll make you sit on the edge of your seat.
","One hell of a ride, your heart will beat and race faster while watching this movie especially if you are a fan of racing cars or etc. Directed by James Mangold (Logan, Walk the Line). Based on true story about American automotive designer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and British race car driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale), together they plan to compete against the race cars of Enzo Ferrari at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in France in 1966. The story itself was so emotional and adrenalin pumping, I'd really recommend if you haven't know the story yet before watching this movie. I'm not really a fan of racing cars but I'm not disappointed either with this one, either you fan or not- you'll enjoy this movie.It's not just about the cars even the race or the business, that's why I liked this movie. It is personal, heartfelt, and touching. With all the long racing scene it won't even bore you, I wasn't even know before about the rivalry between Ford and Ferrari back then but big bravo on the writer and director, the racing scenes had me sitting up on the edge of my seat! This movie manages to get the audience feel the excitement and thrill of racing. A strong screenplay with phenomenal performance by Christian Bale and Matt Damon, not to mention other supporting actors like Noah Jupe and Josh Lucas. The chemistry between Bale and Damon is engaging, their characters fit so well.Solid movie from start to finish, I'd really recommend you to watch it with IMAX. One of the best movies for this year. The ending may wasn't explored enough but if you know the real story, you might know why it wasn't explored enough. It is for the best I guess.",10,18,39,16 November 2019
Captain Marvel," A Major Disappointment
","It is so hard to say that this movie was such a disappointment. I do really excited about it even before the trailer came out, and I really ignore the haters. But, I was expecting so much more. First of all, Brie Larson, she is such a good actress and not to mention Samuel L Jackson. The chemistry between Carol and Fury's (also Goose) is one of the best part of this entire movie. Action scenes are pretty good as always. Such an enjoyable ride, a pretty good entertainment. But that's it, those are Most likely, it is a highly forgettable film.She is the 'most powerful' superhero in the MCU, but really I don't buy it. Even when she is showing off her superpower, I still don't feel it. It's not like the moment when the first time I saw Iron Man, or Thor in Ragnarok. This movie is so fast-paced, also the pacing is flat and dull - maybe because they are kinda in rush on End Game? I always believe she had something more than just to save the world from Thanos, but this movie can not tell me anything. The label of 'most powerful' superhero is not in it. Entire movie is just too way forced.Pretty good CGI especially with the de-aging of early SHIELD Agents but sometimes I can spot the visual effects that kinda look like a PS4 game. Oh yes, the villain! The most boring villain in the entire MCU for the.. most powerful superhero!? It's not fit. Also stop it with the unnecessary jokes, come on. Although Captain Marvel is set in the mid-'90s, the soundtrack is not working. How can Star-Lord moving into planet to planet having some badass playlist while they are on earth.. have none?Overall it's recommended only for the end-credit scene and the Marvel title.",3,43,98,7 March 2019
Us," Mind-Blowing and Terrifying.
","Us is 2019 American psychological horror film directed by Jordan Peele. It's about Adelaide Wilson (played by Lupita Nyong'o) who returns to her house in Santa Cruz, where she grew up as a child for summer vacation. She is haunted by a traumatic experience from the past and concerned something bad is going to happen. Then it did, a group of their doppelgangers showed up at night begins to terrorize them. All dressed in red jumpsuits and carrying golden scissors.The film stars are Lupita Nyong'o, Winston Duke, Elisabeth Moss, and Tim Heidecker. All of them are talented and amazing. Their expression and gestures are not so different from Jordan previous film, Get Out. Unlikely Get Out, this movie had some jokes, well at some point this movie can make you laugh while getting scared. The performance of Lupita is so impressive, she's playing two different characters. Adelaide is a protective mother of two children and Red is a lunatic person.From the beginning to an end, it shows us a lot of foreshadowing and getting more complicated also appalling. It's been a hell of a ride and insanely good. The story does an outstanding job of building up the tension for the story and building the character developments. There are a lot of symbolism and meanings throughout this film, like Rabbits and Scissors. The script of Us is so structured and detailed, but still a lot of plotholes and some logical issues.The sound editing and music of this movie is so terrifying and creepy, and make this movie even more perfect! Bravo, Michael Abels! The cinematography of this movie is the next level, there are a lot of stunning and intense shots in this movie that I can't wait to share. This movie is well-edited with the shots, the story, as well as the pacing.This movie will make you think deeper not only a minutes after watching this but also the next day. Overall, Us is an amazing movie that different from any kind of Horror Thriller movie and Jordan Peele is a hell of a genius. Totally recommended and worth a watch for a thousand times.",10,23,75,20 March 2019
Aquaman," The King has Risen.
","Better than any DCEU film, and some of MCU movies I think. The DC has step up their game - this is another level. Never had I expected this movie will this be good, after the Justice League and Batman V Superman because those movies are trash - and let's forget about those. This is the most ambitious comic-book movie I've ever seen so far. Finally a movie that DC fanboy deserves, this film is just beautiful within the cinematography, visuals, also the action scenes. The action scenes kinda remind me of Romanticism painting, it is visually stunning and breathtakingly beautiful. I'm not a fan of James Wan movies but he did a marvelous job for Aquaman. The cast are outstanding, badass performances. I don't think any actors can take the role of Aquaman better than Jason Momoa. The atmosphere of this film looks magnificent vibrant and has high-quality than any DCEU film. Finally we can see the light after those dark days. It has clear motivations for both heroes and villains, pretty solid.But, DCEU really need to fix their poor lines. The writing isn't the best - some dialogues are still cheesy & awkward. Nothing new for the plot, but it is simply enough - almost the same with any superhero film - save the world, family issues, etc. But it has a great message about polluting the water. Also the film scoring and soundtrack was a miss. And I don't see how and why Black Manta is the best villains, his story kinda flat and lacking for me. Black Manta has daddy issues seems not enough for me to think he is the best villain.Afterall, this is highly recommended movie for superhero movie fans. Also you have to watch it in an IMAX 3D. Worth it.",8,370,746,15 December 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," Extraordinary & Mind-blowing.
","Rami Malek will be forever one of my favorite actors since the day I've watched Mr Robot, I knew he will be one of the biggest star someday. Freddie Mercury is legend, everyone loves him but not everyone knows his story. Freddy Mercury is fearless, but not everyone knows about his desperately lonely. I dont't know how accurate the storytelling is but this movie is absolutely mind blowing and brilliant, such a perfect tribute to the legend!I'm not saying this movie is perfect or masterpiece, infact this movie has some issues with the director and delayed. But after I walk out of the theater, my heart is filled with joy, tears of happiness, brought so many emotions. That's how you know the movie is fantastic, darling. The casting was brilliant, bravo! I can't get enough with Rami Malek, he obviously worked so hard, Rami Malek pulls off an amazing performance, he just brings Freddie back to life and I don't think you will see any better film about Freddie Mercury again. It's an oppurtunity of a lifetime, every aspects of this movie was executed beautifully. Also the whole cast was so close to perfection! Gwilym as Brian May, Ben as Roger, and Joseph as John are amazing as Rami. Truly magnificent. I recommend to go and see this movie, whether you are fans of Queen or not.",10,547,709,2 November 2018
Avengers: Endgame," An experience you'll gonna remember forever.
","There is no way that I could describe my emotions for this movie. I'm totally speechless. I haven't laughed (even cried) this much in Marvel movie or even in any movie. I'm fully on my emotion, there are so many tears of joy and loss. Amazing story, the acting is outstanding, epic action, great CGI, the best storytelling ever told in a superhero movie, amazing performance. I love it more than 3000.Happiness, sadness, pure joy, excitement... I'm gonna miss this moment in my whole life because let's face it- it's been awhile movies can bring such a big enthusiasm like this.It is such an experience you'll gonna remember it forever. People are clapping, laughing, crying, full of a state emotion. It's 3 hours long but it went by like a finger snapping by Thanos, and now I'm thinking I'm actually in Quantum Realm because it felt like 5 seconds. Even though you know where the story is gonna bring you because it's still a 'superhero movie' but it left me speechless. It's not just a superhero movie, it's more than that.**SPOILER ALERT**Even some characters that you didn't like before, you will love them in this movie. Like Captain Marvel. I didn't like her before in her own movie but in Endgame they showed how powerful, how strong and how capable she really is. And now I kinda love her! But Marvel should really be careful of her line though, I didn't like some of her line like 'I'm the strongest' and 'You didn't win because before you didn't have me' duh. Also not gonna forget Hawkeye. To be honest, in Avengers I really didn't like Hawkeye because he's just a 'guy' with an arrow and just randomly showed up in any scene but actually he's character is so BADASS! Everything that we need, what we want is here.Also I don't get it why some people can not accept that Thor is fat or treat him like a joke. I mean, this movie might be trying to give us a message about no matter what 'shape' are you, you can be a hero and save the world. To be honest, I like what they did to Thor, that man is depressed and taking the most responsible after he missed the shot to kill Thanos in Infinity War. Even though he already did killed him but it's not gonna bring back his people of Asgard. Also he's God of Thunder for god sake, he could slap his stomach with thunder and got his abs back.I'm so happy too for Captain America. Finally he could do his dance with Peggy and I didn't expected that we could see the fight between Captain America with his own self. Also when Tony met his father really warm my heart, and we can see the 'real-life' Jarvis - I didn't expected that too.When the whole superhero arrived it is so EPIC! The whole person in theater are screaming and shocked. Gives me a goosebumps and still left me speechless!This movie is absolute perfection. The ending of this movie is we and the characters deserved. It gives a perfect balance for all these past 10 years. Epic and perfect ending, I was not disappointed at all. This movie was completely emotional and visually stunning. Now I get it why the Russo Brothers told us to do a Marvel Movie marathon before watching Endgame because this movie had everything to accomplish what left behind before all of this.Ready or not, whatever it takes.Go watch it for yourself.",10,4501,6929,24 April 2019
Joker," One of the best Psychological Thriller movies & breathtaking performance.
","Honestly, I'm still speechless but let me say this first- Joaquin Phoenix delivers one of the best performances I've ever seen. Joaquin Phoenix's performance never ever let me down, and this is one of the best of his performance ever. It's so depressing, dark, you can feel his emotions so deeply, the way he embodied the role of Joker and somehow you feel empathize for this disturbed and violent character.. it just blew me off.If you just love cinema, you gotta see this movie either you love Marvel or DC- doesn't matter. It doesn't matter at all, what you gonna witnessed is one of the histories of cinema, everything about this movie is a masterpiece and brilliant. But if you just expect the action scenes, for sure you'll be disappointed because this movie is only about how Arthur Fleck become Joker, one of the most iconic comic book villain. The entire time I felt so sorry for Arthur, I want to hug him, I felt so bad for him and I just don't want him to do such bad things. I know it is ridiculous because hey it's Joker but when you saw Arthur, you saw a different person. You will see someone growing onto something evil, disturbing and violent.On every scene, I was always hooked- you won't miss a single thing in this movie, you will keep your toes all the time and stunned by Phoenix performance, cinematography, art, scoring and obviously Todd Philips does a wonderful job for directing and writing this movie, so mesmerizing. I don't know what to tell you more because I don't want to spoil that much but you gotta see this movie, for sure this movie will make some of you uncomfortable in some way but that's the magic of movie. You don't want to miss this masterpiece. I was so blown away especially with the third act. The character development, suspense, and twisting are so beautifully crafted with all of these elements because it's working and so satisfied.",10,1,2,3 October 2019
