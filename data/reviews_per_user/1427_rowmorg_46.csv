Changeling," Ambitious single mom neglects child and pays for it
","Looking past the lush setting of 1928 Los Angeles, which involves various startling trompe l'oeuil effects that must be state-of-the-art but don't help a weak plot, what is Changeling about? It frankly admits that the heroine, Christine Collins, an ambitious single mother played by screen goddess Angelina Jolie, left her nine-year-old child at home all day while she served an extra shift at the telephone company in the hope of a promotion.On this day, she failed to put her son before her work, although she had promised to take him to the movies. Furthermore, there was nobody else to step forward and take her place while she went to the office, because evidently our heroine 1.) did not have any friends 2.) did not have any relatives 3.) did not have any neighbours who could have taken care of the unfortunate boy and thereby prevented him being abducted and killed, and nor did her son have any friends whose parents might have stood in for a few hours and spared him a terrifying day abandoned in his home. So, is Changeling about a lonely, socially incompetent and neglectful mother who indirectly caused her son to be murdered by abandoning him in an empty house? No, obtusely the film is about the persecution of Mrs Collins, who complains when the LAPD fobs her off with a substitute son instead of arresting her for child abuse.Of course, the film takes pains to establish Mrs Collins as a devoted and deeply caring mother who every day accompanies her boy to a massive, impersonal educational institution by public transport, and who cuddles him lots and gives him a proper breakfast and not a packet of junk-food slung after him on the way out the door. Although she apparently has no friends, neighbours or relatives, she is one of the tiny minority who had a telephone at home in 1928, but somehow she fails to use it to check on her beloved son while she is away from him, even though she is a communications professional. Nor has she taught her son to use the instrument from which she makes her living to call her at work and enjoy a few words of reassurance during her eight-hour absence. So it's a bewildering shock to her when she waltzes home after a long day at the office and finds her totally isolated and ignored child missing. Director Clint Eastwood apparently found none of this basic premise for his movie at all ambiguous. For him, Mrs Collins was a model mother and an icon of virtue in a sea of corrupt manhood.If such directorial perversity is not enough to put you off watching this picture, then be warned about the leading lady, Ms. Jolie, whose acting abilities, already limited, are paralysed by the impossible task of portraying a villain as a heroine, and a strong-willed woman as a hapless victim. The result, inevitably, is horribly unconvincing.",4,3,10,4 July 2009
The New World," The worst film ever made
","Who could possibly have thought of starting and ending the movie with an impossibly long monotone? Who the heck thought it might be cute to use a Mozart Piano Concerto as the love theme, even though it was written 150 years after the action depicted? This picture was created by morons. It has so many longeuers that the entire film becomes one. Pocohontas was never believable and Farrell obviously loathed her: no magic whatsoever. Farrell just made doe eyes and thought that would do. By the way, barely a word he said was intelligible, being delivered in some awful Irish brogue. The natives are depicted according to the Puritan psychosis: painted, unpredictable imbeciles. They appeared to have only one breeding-age female: the star of the show (Q'orianka Kilcher), a half-Inca actress who was fourteen years old shooting this pic. She's done nothing but bits and pieces since. The 'development of Virginia' theme is rubbish, because the entire film is about Pocohontas, who has a by no means inspiring story, I assure you: a native princess whom the Puritans turned into a little 'ladyship'. If that turns you on, get this film, if not utterly forget it. It's worthless, and directed by an ignoramus, Terence Malick. Poor old Paramount, what a pack of losers.",1,0,3,11 March 2015
Casablanca," On which hit list does Casablanca belong?
","The world's Number One movie, shown almost nightly on US cable TV, stands wildly at odds with current US policy.Casablanca was greeted by fanfares and eulogies when it was launched in 1942, and it has been praised to the skies ever since, with all the fat movie encyclopedias rating it either Number One, or in the top five movies of all time.How are we to view this picture now, as it gets played almost nightly on the US/Canada cable TV channels, and as the US war machine goes pointlessly berserk in Iraq, commanded by a man of no known military worth? Firstly, Casablanca was about the absurdity of standing aside in World War Two, which is exactly what the USA was doing when the film was prepared and made. The film's schizophrenic hero, Rick/Richard, is profoundly corrupted by his offshore, semi-detached posture (read: American neutrality), which contrasts sharply with his previous committed left-wing adventures (read: the New Deal).His bitter non-involvement has been induced during the panic of the invasion of France, when instead of joining the resistance he had a rash fling with an emigree half his age. He was happy to stick his neck into her, but after the coitus getting interruptus, he is holed up in a huff in Morocco, no longer willing to stick his neck into politics.Our heroine is no less corrupted by detachment, because it was her husband's absence, locked up in some concentration camp, that led to the affair, his instruction to keep the marriage a secret for her own security that led to the consummation, and his being holed up outside Paris after escaping, that led her to go to his side, thereby abandoning 'Richard'.In addition to the unhitched position of the two leading characters, the ending of Casablanca further drives home the message that Rick/Richard is not willing to commit, either to Ilsa or the war, as he slips away with the cock-hatted Casablanca police chief to a safe hole in Brazzaville where they can drink themselves to death. Even Ilsa and Viktor are heading into exile in brightly-lit New York.So, America's favourite film is all about neutrality and not sticking your neck into other peoples' wars, although you are willing to give a leg up to the good guys as long as it does not cost you. This is bizarrely at odds with the USA's current imperialistic posture of pre-emptive war and proactive engagement overseas. Why does Casablanca still play so big on all channels? The only positive character fully engaged in the war, Viktor Laszlo, is a loving husband and practising idealist, but he is also an insurgent leader bent on bringing down the occupying authorities across Europe. Today, Laszlo's face would be on one of the USA's notorious hit-list playing-cards. He would probably have $25m on his head, offering the Ricks of this world a fabulous opportunity for sour treachery.Second, Casablanca has at its heart a major investment in wild and fulfilling extramarital sex. This is hardly a topic that promises to bewitch Jesusland and the Monica baiters.With many marriages broken by war, such overwrought romances were reportedly widespread, but the scriptwriters carefully contrived Ilsa's position so that she was as guilt-free as possible while parting her legs and allowing intro-mission. Mitigating circumstance: the husband had been removed by force majeure for the best part of a year, time enough for the loinal urges awakened by a happy wedding night to make their legitimate physical demands on the wife.Furthermore, Paris was about to fall, an in-extremis situation tailor-made for frantic fornicating all round. Plus Richard, dressed by matrimonially-inclined wardrobe for a wedding, is another idealist who has smuggled arms to Ethiopia (against the Mussoliniites there) and fought with the Loyalists in Spain. Why, he probably drinks with Picasso in Pigalle, where the lovebirds are shown swilling bubbly. Above all, Richard's subservient comrade is an African American jazz musician in whom Ilsa has a fall-back position that hints at yet darker urges.Interracial sex, seduction, fornication, pornography ('Here's looking at ya, babe!'), the only sins overtly missing here are buggery and abortion but we feel that, with his underground contacts, Richard/Rick would have no problem procuring either.Does this seething id-nest at the heart of the film prevent it from being family entertainment? Of course not, because Rick heartily endorses marriage in the denouement, when he tricks the police at gunpoint into allowing that marriage of political and sexual ideals, Viktor and Ilsa, on to a plane to Lisbon.But this sudden lapse into huge decency has a hidden motive. With the marrieds out of the picture, Rick is free to head off into a Buddy-bonding road movie with the chief of police, far from all wars, preemptive or otherwise. Instead of imposing freedom, these two rogues would rather practise it.It's high time the pundits of America's corporate media removed Casablanca from the Top Five and put it on the hit list instead.",Null,0,3,1 July 2005
Minority Report," Feeble sci-fi, ludicrous police procedural, hodge-podge movie
","Just a so-so movie IMO. In spite of its huge budget, it barely makes it as a sci-fi epic: there's only one jet-car, for example. The scene in which Tom Cruise (as Anderton) grabs on to a cop and uses his jet-foil to escape is colourful, but silly. (There's even a blatant continuity error, in spite of the massive budget.) The plot is absurd, with so many holes in it that that our heads spin with the multiple flashbacks, or flash-forwards or whatever they are. The female 'pre-cog' has a see- through garment that exposes her nipples while she's in the water, but later there's an undergarment that makes her decent. We're never quite sure whether Anderton committed the murder or not, which is wildly confusing. The ending is just discursive, via a cell-phone call, and bang the bad-guy shoots himself. Really disappointing. There's not even a chase at the end: very poor film-scripting! Overall, miss this one is my recommendation.",5,2,3,11 November 2014
Training Day," You wanna go to jail or you wanna go home?
","Wow, I just wrote nine --- can't believe it. May have to change it later.The great Denzel Washington covered in bling and driving a retro car with hydraulic raised suspension. He's the super streetwise narcotics officer.The mighty talented Ethan Hawke (a novelist in private life) a super-straight guy with 19 months on the LAPD. It'a his training day: he wants to go through narcotics and become a detective.Put 'em in the blender and mix. The result is explosive.A powerful script by David Ayer, fine casting, including hip black performers, and superb direction by Fuque, and this flick cooks.",9,0,0,30 June 2010
In Bruges," Another embarrassingly awful British flick
","Take an inauthentic theme (British 'hit-men') and a ludicrously inapposite location (Bruges, Belgium), add an unconvincing love interest, and cook with a preposterous villain, and you get In Bruges. This film does not know whether it's a comedy or a tragedy, and works as neither. It breaks the solemn movie law by having no hero, and all its characters are thoroughly unlikeable. It is the quintessential entertainment made 'by those who can do nothing, for those with nothing to do'.You can see how the basic idea could have tweaked the money-men's interest: three British psychopaths cause mayhem in quiet, picturesque Euro-town. Sadly, it reinforces all the ugly stereotypes of UK soccer thugs, refusing to speak the language and trampling over the locals. There's even a rude joke-situation about Canadians, just for good measure. So that's the basic package: buy it if you like it.There's no point in going into the script: it's meaningless. The love interest is a lobotomised and marginalised figure, so women forget it too.The main character (no way he's a hero), played by Colin Farrell, is supposed to have shot a child accidentally, and his partner is to execute him for it, something he never dreamt of. As in the rest of the film, there is no police presence around the killing, a thoroughly childish aspect of this boyish venture. Bruges has been chosen by their boss (Ralph Fiennes, who should have known better) because it will give the victim a little view of fairyland before he dies. The mawkish sentimentality is not just the Fiennes' character's, it is also that of the director, Michael McDonagh.If it is not enough to have polluted the world to a wasteland, we have men dishing up this kind of mindless rubbish in the cinemas and on television. Dear, oh dear, oh dear....",1,22,59,30 October 2009
Unbreakable," I waited 15 years to see this one
","Is David Dunn (Bruce Willis) a comic-book superhero? He survived a terrible train crash: the only person to do so. He discovers that he has never been ill. However, he is lonely, his life is a mess and he considers himself just a regular guy. Then he meets Elijah (Samuel Jackson), who reveals his powers to him.The film is told in director M. Night Shyamalan's typical style: misty, baffled, episodic. The climax comes when Dunn, standing in central station, picks up on a maintenance man with evil desires, follows him and manages to save two children, although their parents have been murdered. He manages to strangle the perpetrator and to read about it in the newspaper next day.His son picks up on Elijah's analysis and decides to shoot his father, to prove he can't die. That's a dramatic scene. Everyone survives, though. There's a mighty twist at the end that is more or less thrown away with final captions. Shyamalan is a deft hand at creating a thriller, and this film is worth watching.",5,1,4,15 March 2015
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Skulls and bones
","Naturally, computer graphics had to get in there --- pirates alone could never be enough for the modern child. She has to have pirates who are ghouls as well, so that the film is a messy hybrid of horror and adventure.The combination of men who can't be killed fighting endlessly with characters made of wood while a symphony orchestra goes crazy is utterly tedious.It's so sad that worldwide youngsters subject to the American global market have only this junk-food to consume on DVD.Throughout the whole deadening two and a half hours, there are about five seconds of shots of the Caribbean. The picture might as well have been shot in Disneyland.Johnny Depp is even more pathetic here than in his next role, The Libertine, in which he played a sex-crazed poet who never touches a woman throughout the whole film.His British accent, predictably, is a mess (as in The Libertine) and his role in this film is to spend long periods in a cell while everyone else gets on with it. The idea that he is some kind of commander of men is ridiculous. He simply camps up the whole picture and makes a mockery of it.Naturally, the plot is the most ludicrous imaginable, it's not even worth discussing. Suffice it to say that it is full of holes you could navigate a ship through.As for black people who populate the Caribbean, just two appear in this picture: one a glimpsed female pirate captain (!), the other a glimpsed huge stereotyped brute with a studded face and massive muscles. So, take your pick: cheesy stereotype or politically correct cut-out. As for the other millions who inhabit the Caribbean, they don't exist.If there was a scrap of history that validated this film as a nostalgic romp, it might be excusable. But since it is a farrago of fantasy and faux-fairytale, it is to be roundly condemned. Everyone who raves about this film is doomed.",1,16,42,17 December 2006
Elizabeth," Official propaganda movie
","'Elizabeth' reserves its longest, most tedious and elaborately produced scene for the Coronation, which betrays the picture as thinly-veiled official propaganda. The history it deploys belongs in the fascistic Arthur Bryant schoolboy textbooks of the early 20th century. What was really happening during her reign was less the internecine plotting over the succession than the birth of brutal capitalism, corporate plunder and enslavement, all with royal court's approval. Elizabeth was the bastard daughter of Henry VIII, who saw her innocent mother beheaded before her eyes on the orders of her deranged father. The 'virgin queen' promotion that has endured for four and a half centuries, probably stems from Elizabeth Tudor-Boleyn inheriting syphilis from her mad father and infected mother, and refusing male relations because of the fear of infecting her own child. You may be sure such a story would never come out, particularly after such a long reign enabled its complete suppression. On the other hand, the Queen's letters record the incredibly detailed care she took over her own and other aristocrats' courts and retainers. Well educated, she seems to have been a person of outstanding qualities trapped in a historic maelstrom. This puerile film only scratches the surface of what was going on in our UK past and is little more than a chocolate box version of history.",5,2,9,21 July 2009
Coffee and Cigarettes," Of connoisseur interest only
","You can see why Jarmusch remains on the fringes, when you view these shorties that he bothered to shelve and then put together in a collection. Apparently a German moneybags helped him make his modestly successful first feature, and evidently keeps him making pictures. These snippets are eminently forgettable to non-cognoscenti. Andy Warhol managed to work the empty film to death, and Jarmusch here is working on a necrophiliac basis. The film does not focus for hours on someone sleeping, but the audience could contribute many cameos, methinks.No doubt a cinephile could deliver a one-hour lecture on the multi-level meanings of this kind of movie-making, but I will not be present.",1,3,7,24 June 2005
Spider-Man 2," A competently directed, fantastically expensive production.
","Only a six, because Kirsten Dunst was so badly photographed. She looked like the girl next door in almost every shot: very homely. Toby Maguire, by comparison, looked terrific, with his steely eyes and deadpan expression throughout. The special effects were superb, with Doc Ock's multiple arms excellently done. This film proves how close comic books and movies really are --- except one costs two hundred thousand times the other. It's a tailor-made 'family' picture with something for everyone. However, I did not think the pair of lovers were convincing: Peter was so wretchedly tongue-tied throughout, and they only kissed for five seconds at the very end. Still, it was good fun to watch.",6,1,4,11 March 2015
Black Book," A women's film devoid of emotional impact
","Black Book is a women's film, about a rich young Jewess, formerly a pop singer, trying to survive in Nazi-occupied Holland. Sadly, director Paul Verhoeven does not understand women and nor does he know how to convey emotion. A glance at his Hollywood CV would have warned the producers. The result is an empty depiction of events, in which the heroine Rachel (Carice Van Houten) acts like Robocop (an earlier Verhoeven effort). Along the way, we get some lingering shots of her tits and a few seconds of her bare bottom. Neither views suit a women's film, a signal that something is very wrong. The motivation of Verhoeven's heroine is contorted, as her family and lover are wiped out before her eyes and she makes a narrow blood-spattered escape, yet does not for a moment shed a tear for them, nor suspect the people who sent them to their fate. Instead, she has unmotivated sex with a resistance member before going into the Nazi headquarters and seducing the Gestapo chief, whom she treats with bizarrely sudden love and affection. Her ostensible purpose is to save three resistance men from torture. Instead, she places a microphone in the torturer's office, and she and her colleagues listen to him having noisy sex. Her motive fades even further into the background as Verhoeven makes a meal of the Nazi setting, presumably to appeal to his German market. This is a thoroughly unpleasant film made by a very cynical and sociopathic film-maker, and it deserves to be blasted into oblivion by the idiotic 'Inglourious Basterds', which has the merit of being sheer fantasy and frank wish-fulfilment.",3,14,22,12 September 2009
Constantine," Nearly 1,000 reviews --- and here's another
","It's extraordinary how religion's purest superstition attracts American audiences. The idea of a permanently burning hell-world just a pill or a shot or a state-of-mind away below the floor is so powerful that hordes of people crowd into cinemas to see the enaction of it. Then hundreds of them go to IMDb actually to write it up. Evidently, a certain level of people have not improved their world outlook since the 15th or 16th centuries, when fiery little sheets and pamphlets first came off the presses, telling of visits to hell, and anthologising the efforts of fictional men like John Constantine (Keanu Reeves).It's never quite clear what Constantine's vocation or profession or trade is. Some reviewers describe him as a PI, or private investigator. I think that reflects the wildly superstitious audience again. PIs tend to spend most of their time on the internet and telephone, using reams of documents. They'd be in trouble in a world of flames, but 'Hell wants him. Heaven won't take him. Earth needs him,' according to the movie blurb.Naturally, Satan, the former angel of light turned devil of the flames, appears in Constantine, and it's not satisfactory, considering that Peter Stormare 'began his acting career at the Royal National Theatre of Sweden'. He was a bit overprepared, perhaps, for the rather poor dialogue (from Kevin Brodbin and Frank A. Cappello), and unimaginative directing from rock-video maker Francis Lawrence.The English dolly-bird Rachel Weisz is a good match for Keanu, because the lines are not that great, the sets suck, and frankly looks do count when all else fails. Mind you, this is US mass cinema and apart from madam there's no sex here at all.",3,1,4,8 February 2010
Troy," Glorification of war
","Sex is hotter in war. Love is more passionate. Women are turned on by it. No one experiences pain. Misery is a chance to act out. Looting and burning are a gas. Everything is sorted in a flash. Hormones make the world go round.The battle of Troy --- in fact the war for Ilium, but don't let's bother about a mere detail like the name of the city in question --- according to those who lived much closer in time than we, bore no resemblance whatsoever to this utter travesty, which sacrifices all to make war into glamorous entertainment and, ultimately, recruitment propaganda.The war was determined by the gods, and took longer to decide than Julius Caesar's eight-year campaign to conquer France. 'The gods' is no mere word. A scientist called Julian Jaynes has written a fascinating study (look it up) of how The Iliad shows that men thought differently in that era, before men's capacities were externalised into technology. 'The gods' describes a superior mentality that we would do well to research and attempt to restore, if we want a livable future world.The idea of men fighting a war over a woman had an irony for the Classical world that we have lost, because the Greek ruling class was entirely bisexual, as was Achilles (although that is censored out here). Menelaus was doubly moronic for dragging Greece into a drawn-out bloodbath over a dame when he had innumerable boys on whom to sate his lust.To view the supplementary features about this film, you really start wondering how far off the day is when no actors or sets will be required for an epic. Brad Pitt must have pondered the deeper significance of his lines about immortality when he reflected that his image could be recreated on screen in any number of roles indefinitely, using the powers of CGI.",Null,0,9,12 September 2005
Ed Wood," Pointless film about a forgettable figure
","This picture is such a good example of the living end of the American sense of humour, it's astonishing that Jud Apatow did not produce it. The basic material is amusing enough: the story of a movie director so pathetically bad that he never even tried to make a good film. Amusing, that is, for about 10 minutes before the real feature begins. Sadly, director Tim Burton is not able to spin out the talentless Ed Wood's forgettable career into a proper movie because of sheer lack of story. The man managed to pull off one ghastly failure after another far into mid-life, when television mercifully put an end to his efforts. The only angle available is his failed attempt to resuscitate the career of Bela Lugosi (Landau), an ancient vampire ham from silent days. Anyone who remembered Landau's comic role in Woody Allen's Crimes & Misdemeanours would not be surprised by Landau's rich comic creation here. But it's wasted on Depp's Ed Wood, who only has two facial expressions: brazen self-confidence and perplexed frown. There must be about half a per cent of the movie-going public that is interested in the basement range of bad films produced in the 1950s, and for them this will be de rigueur, but for everyone else, forget it.",1,6,22,25 August 2009
Closer," Marber's Hollywood suck-hole vehicle
","Patrick Marber has never had a sexual relationship with a woman, particularly an American woman, as Closer demonstrates. But Hollywood commerce is so overwhelmed that this Oxford graduate has written a hit play starring, not one female American citizen, but two, that the 'pocket-book' (English: wallet) is out and the check handed over before the ink is dry. Two drawling Yankee stars in London who ask each other where the 'loo' is! How charming! We'll overlook Marber's utterly blatant device of disguising his ignorance by making one of them a 'waif' so secretive (or vacuous) that she has no background at all, while the other is a 'photographer' ---- need one say more? Or, for that matter, less? Marber, like Noel Coward, must be one of those men who 'love their privacy' and write dirty about women, just as Noel Coward did, so very successfully in the 1920s, then went on to star in stiff-upper lipped anti-camp war movies. Talk about discipline, dear! War is relevant, because Marber accepted an award for his play from the London Evening Standard newspaper, which only a couple of years later was faking its front-page to make it look as if a huge crowd had cheered the demolition of Saddam Hussein's statue in Baghdad, instead of a rag-tag group of stooges admitted by watching U.S. Marines psy-ops men. That when he was 25 Marber contributed to sketches by progressive comedian Rory Bremner and by the time he was 35 was composing this theatrical contrivance says everything about passing 30 and remaining trustworthy. Let's end this by listing just a few of the ways Marber demonstrates his utter ignorance of how an American woman works: 1. When she is knocked unconscious in the street by a passing car, she wakes up, smiles, and says: 'Hello, stranger'. 2. Although she works in a strip joint, and knows only his first name and entrance to his place of work a world away in Canary Wharf, she moves in with him. 2. Although she is a top professional photographer, she takes pictures of an unknown author for his first novel (that is the most ridiculous idea of all). 2 a. At his behest, she starts necking with him. 3. When she meets another American woman, a rival for her man, she inquires: 'Where's the loo?' although she has just arrived in England. 4. She never speaks about herself. 5. When accosted in a public place by a sex-crazed stranger who flashes his lab-coat at her, she remains seated and addresses him with utter composure, then marries him.",1,5,10,5 April 2005
Capote," An actor crucifies his lines and everyone raves
","Truman Capote spoke clearly. I saw him on TV. He enunciated his words and everyone understood. Sadly, in 'Capote', that is not the case. Hoffman chews up almost every line in the script, butchering the movie. Just look at his mouth when you can see into it. His tongue is curled up over his palate, a contortion Hoffman seems to feel is necessary to carry off his impersonation. He lithps, contorts his vocal cords, and has paralysis of the lips all at the same time. The result: virtually none of his lines is fully comprehensible from beginning to end. Effectively, Hoffman throws away his role in order to pull off an impersonation, and his lines go down the toilet as well. It's no wonder at all that he did not receive an Oscar for this sad waste of a good role. All in all, this is a sordid production, with a depressing ending. Capote, a minor writer who enjoyed a bloated celebrity status in the bubble of Manhattan, thought he saw an opportunity in the Clutter killings far off in the hinterland. Exactly what originally attracted him must have been homosexual, but the director makes no effort to explain. Dominick Dunne's attraction to high-society murder cover-ups made a lot more sense. Perhaps Capote thought he could make fun of the hicks. Sadly for him, he fell in love with one of the convicts. The photographs of the two men shown in the film were clearly of pornographic interest to a homosexual. The prison visits also had lurid homosexual overtones, but the director ignores this blatant aspect of the case. Capote spun the imprisonment out so that he could extract from Smith an unexpected confession. It turned out to be a shocker. His love object and not the unpleasant other man, had performed all the murders, for just 40 or 50 dollars. The film somehow fails to live up to this revelation, perhaps because it cops out with explanatory flashbacks instead of powerful dialogue. In fact, the only man in this grim affair who was going to make big money out of it was Capote himself. In a kind of stupor, he attended the hanging of his confidant. He became seriously depressed by his own cynicism and eventually drank himself to death, never completing another book. The movie is directed on auto-pilot and seems to fail to understand the implications of a lot of what it tells, above all the homosexual aspects. Its financial success seems to have been achieved by word of mouth, with only a couple of dozen cinemas carrying it at the launch and the studio getting it into more than a thousand a couple of months later. Perhaps the gay market carried it alone. It's hard to imagine anything so depressing appealing to any other sector of the public.",1,9,19,27 May 2006
The Devil Wears Prada," Workaholics Unanimous
","Being a journalist is just hard work, and all the glamour of the fashion industry is merely trappings to any professional. Obviously a Hollywood film is not going to take that approach, and will focus on everything that is not central to the task confronting the editor of a very expensive publication. The Devil Wears Prada makes appropriate fun of the dedicated Miranda Priestly (get the play on words) and yet soon our heroine gets sucked into her workaholism and is shaping up to be a good professional editor herself, before she has a sudden, unexpected aneurism and dashes deliriously across the Paris traffic, experiencing convulsions that cause her to throw her cellphone/mobile into the Art Nouveau fountain. Back in New York, still having some kind of breakdown, she hallucinates meeting her perpetually three-day stubbled boyfriend (a short-order cook by trade) and has a vision of Miranda across the street. Then she walks out of the picture leaving us pretty confused as the credits roll. What about Miranda? Well, she just had to keep at it, didn't she --- after all, the show must go on. They splashed a lot of money on this picture, but it's a groupie show and doesn't make any telling points.",6,0,0,29 December 2006
The White Ribbon," A Children's Story
","The sub-title (A German Children's Story) shows where director Haneke's mind was in the making of this excellent mystery, The White Ribbon. The young schoolteacher hero clearly suspects his class of village children to be the chief suspects in a series of local crimes, although the shocked Pastor makes him swear to silence. The teacher (in old man's voice-over) postulates the popular explanation for the events: that the Doctor and his mistress, in their perverted relationship, themselves caused or perpetrated the crimes. But his own suspicions loom larger in the end, hinting at some unspeakable change occurring in European humanity at the dawn of the 20th century.Typically, the English-speaking take on this wonderfully evocative monochrome movie is that it hints at the origins of Nazism, but this is a parochial view. The British and Americans themselves have performed unspeakable acts in modern times: for example, the imposition of slavery on generations of Africans, or the cruel suppression of the Kikuyu people in their own land of Kenya, just to name two examples.This powerful film says something, not about Austria, or Germany, but about the western human condition, with its hypocritical hang-ups about sex, its obsession with books, and perverted male chauvinism. This is a long film, and non German-speakers have to rely on sub-titles (although the German is excellently spoken), but for those with eyes to see, and hearts to feel, it is an important statement. Not to be missed.",8,22,43,17 November 2009
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," All the fascinating detail of the novel is gone
","Yes, it's a powerful movie (and immensely long). However, only in a prose work can you convey the mass of detail required by this complex story: the magazine Millennium, the reasons for Blomqvist's fate, his relationship with the married publisher, his journey north, his relationship with a tangled very wealthy family, his investigation of its background and the fate of a teenage-girl member, his discovery of satanism, his relationship with Lizbeth, and so on. It's a complex story told in hundreds of pages by its author (with many hundreds more pages in the two follow-ups) before his death. The movie is a pale shadow, with only a few brutal passages between Lizbeth and her cruel social worker, and Blomqvist and the Nazi. There's a couple of pretty explicit sex scenes between Blomqvist and Lizbeth and that's it. It's a sketch of the novel, even if it remains a powerful picture and worth seeing.",7,2,4,23 September 2014
Die Hard 2," Insane carbon emissions making this time-waster
","Far more offensive than Bruce Willis smoking tobacco and cursing his way through this actioner is the delirious expenditure of fossil fuels incurred by the irresponsible studio and the sociopathic director, Renny Harlin (false name). In his commentary (on the DVD), Harlin describes how the picture, on a tight schedule, became a mad search for snow all over the North American continent. Harlin flew his 300 crew, overpaid cast, and fleet of planes tens of thousands of miles in search of the white stuff. In Spokane, Wash., he arrived with hundreds of technicians, vehicles and airplanes, hired hundreds of extras, and woke up in the morning to find the snow had melted. The same thing happened elsewhere. Harlin describes how he could not believe the industrial agglomeration of 'three miles' of trucks that assembled at a Denver location. This kind of carbon expenditure is an environmental crime in itself, forget the 'terrorists' depicted in the movie. Harlin should be grounded from airplanes for the rest of his life, he is a single-handed enforcer of climate change and the destruction of the human environment.",1,9,28,10 September 2009
Meet the Fockers," To think that the purveyors of this trash want to wipe out the French cinema
","Hollywood (and you can't get more Hollywood than Universal and Dreamworks) is still fighting the subsidy battle in Europe. They have already forced French films on to specialty shelves in video rental outlets in France, where Hollywood blockbusters line the shelves. In cinema terms, the French (who invented the moving picture) are guests in their own country. Meet the Fockers, with its offensive and ill-bred title, stands for everything nasty and greedy about the superpower movie industry today. It is a rehash of used goods. It dispenses with a story line. It cynically exploits children and animals for unfunny gags. It is filled with smut. It presents a debased, unrecognisable, version of Jewish religious ritual (the shotgun wedding at the end). It recycles actors who are past their use-by dates, presumably in order to pay lower fees. The credits suggest that Robert De Niro put money into this picture. What a laugh. The family values cynically promoted in this picture seem to have little interest for him in his private life. Perhaps it was a make-work project for himself. He has driven his acting career to such a low point that his phone must have stopped ringing long ago. Compare Al Pacino's fine work in a picture like The Merchant of Venice. Compare the noble treatment of Judaism in that fine picture with the trivialisation of it in this movie. Dustin Hoffman must be desperate. His character is made of pieces of cardboard that don't even match. One minute he is cuddling DeNiro, kissing his neck and preaching love, the next he is brutalising him in a tediously choreographed US football game in the garden. He's about as funny as a patient in a mental home. Barbra Streisand...well, there's a lady who once could sing. Her voice was huge and her record sales matched. But she can't do comedy. Ben Stiller has aged. He no longer looks the ingenu in close-up. His character fails to work when played by a middle-aged man. Apparently the spaniels are paying to see this junk. Perhaps they think it's funny, or just sit there remembering the previous film and thinking this must be funny too. Perhaps they wait patiently, then exit agreeing that it was very funny so they feel they did not waste their money. Who can explain these mutts? The US audience increasingly seems to be getting the films it deserves. Sorry I can't be more positive---there are films I like, I swear. But increasingly, they are never from the US dream machine.",1,5,7,27 April 2005
The Chorus," An unlikely but charming transition of bad boys into angelic choir
","Les Choristes is a triumph of wish-fulfilment, and director/writer Christophe Barratier wastes little time on the process that should be at the heart of the film: how to turn a class of very difficult boys into a trained choir with no support at all from the principal's office. It's a heart-warming, feel-good yarn with great performances from everyone, but anyone with experience in education is going to have to suspend their disbelief from the ceiling, as newbie teacher M. Mathieu (Gérard Jugnot) effortlessly transitions from getting the tykes to chirp out snippets of naughty ditties to faultlessly harmonising Rameau before the school governors. Somewhere in the middle there, about half an hour of exposition is missing, in which Mathieu has to chuck out recalcitrant brats, knock heads together, and dish out lines. However, as I say, this is wish-fulfilment; we're in an imaginary past that should not be mistaken for today's reality. As fairy-tales go, this is wonderfully put together, and was a sure-fire box-office hit in France, where French womanhood could not fail to fall for all the lads and sing along with their divine music. Everybody wants to believe this kind of educational miracle is possible, and I am not going to disillusion them on this board. Seven for pure escapism.",7,0,0,20 September 2009
The Incredibles," It's American --- and it's ironic!
","The Incredibles is not just an impeccably crafted entertainment package, it is self-mocking and ironic, qualities that rarely inhabit the American soul. It is a scintillatingly gifted production, but as so often, being American, it wants to supply more than just enough, so it's a wee bit long, and a wee bit convoluted. But these are only quibbles: it's hard to imagine anything more compelling for the juvenile mind --- except experiencing it in three dimensions. The sound is super: in our home we have cinema surround-sound and some of the effects were highly dynamic, zapping your ears as well as your eyes. Highly recommended for wild distraction and some moments of hilarity. Definitely watch it beside your children.",7,0,0,25 October 2009
Stardust," Where did this pile of twoddle come from?
","The UK film industry is in a bad enough state without some producer coming up with this feeble idea about 'stars'. All he could muster was two worn-out old ladies: Claire Danes (who looked really plain in some shots) and Michelle Pfeiffer. It was impossible to understand whence Claire Danes's role came: the Moon? Anyway, lots of much bigger stars turned down the role, probably as soon as they read the vacuous, derivative, extremely thin, screenplay written by Jane Goldman. Just to assure himself that he would lose the studio about $50m, the producer Neil Gaiman hired Robert De Niro for a cameo role. Huge loss guaranteed by that choice. The characters rush about, although we the viewers have little idea of what's happening. Peter O'Toole, in what must have been his last role, spoke his lines clearly enough to set up the ridiculous plot, but we still did not understand.This is Neil Gaiman's revenge on Britain, I guess, since he's moved to the USA.",3,0,6,26 January 2015
The Elephant Man," A Victorian morality yarn with a thin story and thick make-up
","Choosing monochrome for his foray into the smog age and Jack-The-Ripper back-street London, director David Lynch does everything to place his freak-show action far in the past. However, he is exploiting the Elephant Man (Hurt as John Merrick) no less than his 'owner' was in the fairground. He offers no explanation for the man's condition, not even from the eminent surgeon Treves (Hopkins) who got the unfortunately deformed man admitted to the London Hospital. Apparently, plastic surgery was far in the future when Treves practised medicine. Not even a dental surgeon was able to sort out Merrick's mouth for him, it seems. Once this is established, the medical dimension is removed from the story and it shrinks into a little morality tale that can barely support a 90-minute feature. There's no sub-plot, for example, to change the tempo, and the civility of Merrick's entry into society is laboured while we wait for the janitor to bring in his paying crowd, along with the wretched, drunken 'owner', and wreck Merrick's life once again. Anne Bancroft's walk-on appearance as an improbable West End actress speaking American and doing a reading of the love scene from Romeo & Juliet is poorly handled as the story clunks along in 'and then', 'and then' mode. The Elephant Man is a rather tiresome and poorly constructed bio-pic that fails to transcend the age in which it is set, and succeeds only in making a banal point about the gulf between appearance and inner nature, something that Charles Dickens would have handled in one paragraph.",5,6,13,24 August 2009
Gran Torino," Same old scowl, same old guns: no orang-utan
","If you succeed in comprehending the dialogue in this movie, you will find that it contains no interesting or unpredictable lines, apart from the ugly racist sneers uttered by Clint Eastwood, whose voice --- never good --- is worse than ever. Ahney Her (as Sue) is no advertisement for Hmong elocution, since she s generally incomprehensible. She seemed to have developed some rare skill of gobbling her words: perhaps it's a Hmong thing. Apart from the lousy delivery, the film is remarkably uncertain about its handling of the key plot element: ethnic gangs. The most uncertain moment is when the gang pestering Sue's family has the astonishing experience of having one of its members beaten up by a very old man in its own gang house, and do they go to Clint's house for a showdown with him? No, they go to Sue's house! Well, that way, Clint lives to die another day. Any movie that considers a 1972 uncatalysed Ford as an icon of the good life is so retarded that it should never have been released.",1,7,17,9 January 2010
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," The incredibly boring film of Benjamin Button
","A truly awful movie is hard to find. Usually there is just a spark of something that made the film beat the production system that always says 'no'. In this film it is utterly incomprehensible who thought it might be interesting, and who thought it would be successful. The story seemed like a good idea to F.Scott Fitzgerald, who was making the equivalent of a quarter million dollars per story at the time (that was when people read stories). The very implausible birth of a 90 year-old baby could be glossed over. Same with his childhood. Same with how his foster-parents could ever get attached to him. Fitzgerald's rip-off of Wilde's The Portrait of Dorian Gray could be carried off in the imagination. But when a literal-minded commercial cinema put it into production, it just didn't work at all. Implausible from the word go, it remained implausible throughout its immense, mind-crushing length. Only the most raving egomaniacs could have produced this huge turkey and thought they'd make something great. It was dead from the kick-off. Any lover of cinema should studiously avoid this giant turd of a movie and not even watch it just to see what happens. Nothing happens. Period.",1,7,12,15 January 2010
Wimbledon," No croquet in this picture
","The tennis matches were well faked in this flick, with glimpses into the mind of the lead player (Paul Bettany) that we were not granted for his love-match (Kirsten Dunst), who is mainly presented on her back in bed. As usual, her role is seriously underwritten: she has no friend (as Bettany's character does), she has no car, and misbehaves during the competition by drinking, eating and shagging. Why he is able to win in his early 30s in spite of this behaviour, while she loses in her mid-20s is incomprehensible. Anyway, they both get out of tennis 'it's only a game', get married and have two children in a highly traditional manner that probably made many female movie-goers vomit into their popcorn. Yes, it's a highly traditional movie, all about a male winning and a female worshipping him and having his babies, but it's all right because it's only entertainment, right? Seven for entertainment value. BTW, Wimbledon is the All-England Tennis and Croquet Club --- the croquet got well neglected in this particular picture.",7,0,0,8 September 2013
Guardians of the Galaxy," A.D.D. cases will love this picture
","After the sickeningly sentimental start (probably meant to allow for settling in and munching time) the picture goes off on all cylinders for a straight two hours with barely a pause. I remember thinking at a couple of points: 'Oh, a scene here,' but it got cut off anyway. There's not a moment to think about anything, including the rocket designs, the enormous city that is portrayed, or any of the many wicked characters. Everything rushes by in a welter of images and fragmentary plot-lines until the brain spins. The mcguffin is this daft ball that looks exactly like a baseball made of wrought iron, which when twisted reveals a brilliant gem that can destroy the world. It doesn't matter, because our hero grabs it anyway and undergoes a lengthy traumatic experience only remedied by his friends grabbing onto him and taking some of the strain. A likely story, but no more far-fetched than the rest of this idiotic fantasy that almost made its giant budget back on its first weekend. Big earnings ahead for this 3- D special. Definitely worth seeing for sci-fi fans.",7,7,14,7 August 2014
Mission: Impossible II," Ugly virus released by Hollywood studio: US movie industry doomed
","Complete silliness is nothing new on the silver screen, but complete silliness that involves more than 60 different stuntmen (I counted them on the credits) is getting decadent. Hugely overrated Hong-Kong director John Woo professes himself a Christian and star/producer Tom Cruise is a self-avowed 'Scientologist' (whatever that is), so there's the usual hypocritical sexual morality pitted against indulgent bloody violence. The millions of children who will watch this film world-wide could validly conclude that violence is normal and sex non-existent. You would never know, by watching this lengthy stomp-romp, that half the movie audience is female, most of whom are turned off by violence and more interested in relationships. Apparently, Cruise made $75 million from this picture, which was so poor that Paramount fired him for it. That's decadent, too. But we're talking about a global movie industry in which dialogue is barely comprehensible (because it will only get dubbed anyway) and the story is only an excuse for 'action' of the sort that even chimpanzees will watch. A parting thought: the bad guy, played by Dougreay Scott, is trying to steal a whack of money and gets killed for it. Funny, because a big heist is what the good guy, Tom Cruise, pulled off when he made this picture. Funny old world, isn't it.",1,2,4,8 August 2009
Avatar," Gigantic waste of money on a poor story and rotten dialogue
","It's an eternal rule of film-making that the story-arc must be powerful and the lead roles believable for any movie to make it into the top few hundred of all time. On this basis, Avatar will be quickly forgotten. The story is hackneyed and the dialogue is bland and delivered without much conviction. Director James Cameron has to take the entire responsibility for this failure, since he takes sole credit for the script. The special effects and photography and costumes are mind-boggling in 3-D, which is why the picture is watchable, but they will not combine to thrust the picture into legend. The gigantic budget of the movie could easily have gone towards dozens of engaging little films such as Juno or Once, allowing many writers and directors to get on to the big screen. One point that is key for me: Avatar breaks every single rule laid down by the Dogma Film movement(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogme_95) that has produced so many excellent low-budget cinema experiences.",5,5,11,1 January 2010
Pulp Fiction," The most ludicrously inflated reputation of any film
","The hugely overrated trivial chatting, the grotesque violence, the moral vacuum, the deadly slowness, the length --- about an hour too long --- make it incomprehensible today how this picture ever made people rave the way they did on this board.The greatest film ever? Excuse me, this is a feature film that says nothing, depicts no authentic feelings or character development, is grossly self-indulgent and filled with idiotically implausible situations, such as people firing powerful handguns repeatedly, simultaneously and then hanging around chatting as if nobody would ever report the firing and summon the law.Perhaps the most implausible character of all is played by Mr Tarantino, who shouts at the two hoodlum killers as if they were playmates from school and complains that his wife will divorce him if she returns from work to find a car in the garage containing a man with his head blown off.Where is the moral compass of the people who revere this schoolboy nonsense? Nobody in the film is remotely principled, and nor is anyone (except possibly the pawnbroker) actually evil. The scene where he releases a leather-studded sadist from a cage is possibly the most unbelievable rubbish ever deployed in a Hollywood feature.'It's only entertainment,' I hear people protest. Well the difference between Mr Tarantino and film-makers of stature is that they are capable of entertaining while instructing, and of integrating the two.",1,214,515,18 December 2005
Jack Reacher," Cheesy but gripping nonetheless
","I also thought Rosamund Pike had large breasts: most actresses are either without or under-endowed. Turns out she was five months pregnant by lurking City weirdo Robie Uniacke: he of the four previous wives, several of them much younger than him, including Ros. Tom Cruise produced this movie, which made at least $20 million profit, so hack writer Lee Child drew the crowds in for this ageing Hollywood hero, who doesn't seem able to lose money on pictures, an unusual quality. How he produces, reads and learns scripts while being dyslexic is something no one understands except him, and he attributes it to his Scientology. Go figure! Jack Reacher might be another multi-picture venture for Cruise, because age doesn't matter when you are an avenging angel. Of course, the end is the big disappointment in this kind of beyond-the-law fantasy, because all the bad guys are lying dead in the street. But this story has a good twist in it, and the villain has only one finger!",7,0,3,30 October 2013
The Da Vinci Code," Da Da Vinchy Code
","Dan Brown faced many weeks in court for plagiarism over this book, and somehow escaped, although it seemed to me that Holy Blood, Holy Grail, written by two TV producers in the early 1980s, certainly WAS the story behind it. Brown dodged the suit by having added all the daft puzzles that punctuate the so-called action. I visited a village on the Camargue coast called Les Trois Saintes Maries, where the tradition goes that the three Marys of the Holy Story landed and lived on, thus many people in the South of France would find nothing surprising about the basic proposal behind the balderdash that Brown trowels on top of it, replete with cod-codes in doggerel English verse --- a language that started to be used some thirteen hundred years after the Holy Story was invented. But it's fair enough that Brown published this rubbish: it's the millions of readers who lapped it up who need their heads read. They poured in to this movie in their millions, too, and the participants must be laughing all the way to the bank. The whole thing is preposterous, never believable for more than one minute, lousily written, appallingly acted and utterly gauche from start to finish. The mad monk, Silas, belongs in a horror film, his Opus Dei mentor in a farce, and the English Milord in a mental hospital. Even the requisite romance between the leading lady and the protagonist never occurs. When Hanks pulls it all out and announces: 'You are the closest living descendant of Jesus Christ' our house rocked with wild laughter --- so thanks for that, at least, Mr Hanks.",1,0,3,19 December 2006
War of the Worlds," The great genius obsessed with his toys
","Mr Spielberg probably never read the script in its entirety at one sitting, because if he had, he would have noticed how many rules of scriptwriting it broke. (The three writers involved seem never to have taken so much as a weekend scripting course.) The hero is unlikable from the start, encounters no particular hurdles other than the central plot hurdle faced by all humanity, and there is no sub-plot that takes him off-screen for more than three seconds. Furthermore, in a climactic scene he commits a gratuitous murder of a brave fellow citizen for the most spurious of reasons, without punishment. In other words, the script stinks. Like a spoilt kid obsessing over his toys, Mr Spielberg was evidently chiefly interested in only one aspect of this silly picture: the special effects. The DVD contains a long, boring 'special feature' about this side of things, with a lot of nerdy staffers attributing all the non-existent inspiration to their boss (Spielberg) and giving boring glimpses of their artwork, which to my (admittedly inexpert) eye looked unoriginal. Weren't tripods featured in the comic-book version many decades ago? The sad thing is, that without these extravagant inventions, the movie amounted to a cheesy and improbable children's adventure yarn. My suggestion: avoid all movies made by Mr Spielberg, who has a retarded aesthetic sense, and all movies leading with special effects, particularly Industrial Light and Magic. The latter throws no light, is not magical and certainly is industrial.",Null,3,6,18 September 2006
Downfall," Powerful, and yet strangely inadequate
","US Air Force General Curtis E Lemay, who supervised the atomic bombings of undefended Hiroshima and Nagasaki, infamously talked of 'bombing them back to the stone age', and grimly joked: 'If we got to start over again, I want Adam and Eve to be Americans'. That's what happened to Berlin. A great left-wing city, the city of Christopher Isherwood and Cabaret, turned into a vast burned-out shell, with sister cities Hamburg and Dresden flattened by allied bombing. Seven million Germans are said to have been wandering homeless in April 1945, bombed out of their homes by Churchill's murderous war on civilians. The massive armoured columns that had fanned out over Eastern Europe as far as the gates of Moscow, nearly taking the oilfields of Baku thousands of miles away, had been wiped out by the Soviet hordes, and now the yellow menace was invading the Kuhrfurstendamm, drunken, raping and pillaging. In a bunker we witness the madman Adolf Schickelgruber, alias Hitler, cursing his nation and condemning them to death with him. Everyone is a traitor, and even now as the house collapses on his head, he is willing to order people summarily shot. How to capture the scale, the scope of this overwhelming disaster? From ruling a continent to controlling a city block, all in a couple of years! Truly, it's beyond the power of one feature film, but this German team has tried, and produced a drama that is compelling and yet lingeringly inadequate. How can you possibly show a whole city being raped? How to depict more than 150,000 individual women being multiply violated in the greatest unpunished sex crime of the modern era? Most of all, how do you explain and convey the magnetism of Schickelgruber, the angry little corporal determined to get his own back on behalf of a whole people? Stripped of his state trappings, Bruno Ganz's fuhrer is little more than a nobody with a mammoth chip on his shoulder who believes the Prussian elite has turned against him. It is ultimately inexplicable how he hypnotised the German nation and actually managed to get elected and formally appointed Chancellor, unless you blame it on the threat from the vast Communist empire next door. Germans must be somewhat bewildered to glimpse Berliners carving meat off dead horses in the ruined streets, considering their standard of living is twice that of any other European country today. They don't know the half of it, and this film, for all its merits, won't tell them.",Null,2,8,31 October 2005
WALL·E," Waste Allocation Load Lifter, Earth-Class, escaped into wrong movie
","It would be nice to say what this film was about, but I'd have a job. There's this character called Waste Allocation Load Lifter, Earth-Class, or WALL-e, in other words Wally. He's a bashed up robot who keeps crushing waste and building high-rises out of it long after humans have left Earth. There's an event, and somehow a quite different being appears, and adopts a teeny little green seedling. This different being, known as M-O, takes the seedling back to Axiom, an orbiting world where humans have turned into blob-like TV-addicts. After that, I have no idea what happens. It's all basically about the little green shoot, with our two heroes struggling against the odds. I couldn't make head nor tail of it.Yes, WALL-e was cute, but oh man, there was FAR TOO MUCH machinery in this picture.",3,2,8,8 February 2010
Music and Lyrics," Appalling trash
","Hugh Grant is finished. This movie killed his career. He should never have taken the part. His bump and grind was pathetic at the beginning of the two-hour agony, and it was desperate at the end. Drew Barrymore --- why is she an actress? Her chin needs hours of work by the cameraman to reduce it, and her voice is, well, very ordinary. Her role as the cleaning lady was utterly unconvincing and her role as a songwriter was even worse. The big hit that Hugh and she wrote together would have failed even the very early screening rounds of Pop Idol in Grand Rapids. The movie's plot was so formulaic that it gave formulae a bad name. The only person who shone out in this picture was Haley Bennett --- she was electric! Why wasn't the film about HER? When the two heroes walked out of her party, I felt I was being dragged away from the action by two losers: horribly to pay for a ticket for such a feeling! Hugh's blathering rubbish about how wonderful the 'music industry' is was just the very worst speech I have ever seen such an actor deliver. To think he achieved an Oxford degree to appear in this trash. Sad, sad, sad.",1,3,12,14 May 2007
The Queen," Another fly-on-the-wall confidence trick
","Another master of the genre, Paul Greengrass, blew-back on all his fans when he made the fictional 'United 93' and passed it off as 'meticulous reconstruction'. Here's another, from a far inferior writer (he started with some TV farrago called 'Shalom Joan Collins'), and another director who should have known better, Stephen Frears. Writer and director pretend they knew exactly what was happening in Number 10 and in Balmoral Castle, without a scrap of evidence to show for it. For all we know, the Queen was being held captive in Balmoral, and Blair was obeying his CIA masters who saw him into office. There's no mention of the security services of any of the countries involved: the USA, France or the UK. The portrait of Tony Blair is fawning: family man, working stiff, decent to the core. The portrait of HM Queen is even more reverent: reserved to a fault, massively dignified, a true monarch. Her inward humanity is demonstrated by the idea that she felt sorry for a stag shot by an investment banker: pure fantasy, of course. However, the spectacle of Reggie Dwight/Elton John entering Westminster Abbey to sing his Marilyn Monroe song adapted for Diana (she didn't even merit a new song) reminded one of the hideous reality of TV Britain, and I must admit that for one moment I actually sympathised with my sovereign (as presented in effigy by the film-makers).",1,14,31,30 April 2007
Vanilla Sky," Impossible to spoil such an awful movie
","Pretentious, boring, lengthy, incomprehensible, Spanish: the bad words keep spilling out. Only the undetermined 'attractions' of star Tom Cruise caused this dreadful picture to make the approximately $40m it is billed as having earned. Neither of the two competing horizontals, Penelope Cruise nor Cameron Diaz made any contribution. At least Ms. Cruz has breasts (we saw them), which Ms. Diaz did not (we did not see them). Ms. Diaz, driving to her death, had the line 'I swallowed your sperm', which must have come directly from the Spanish script that inspired this still-born movie. I was barely able to keep awake for the whole of this head-banging experience and yearned to switch off: my partner somehow wanted to keep going, but couldn't explain why. I guess it's just wanting to see more of Tom Cruise's uncrushed and mashed facial features, which were restored several times during the incoherent script. Certainly the crash in which he got it wrecked was definitively final and should have killed the megastar and ended this picture. It would have been a favour to us all.",1,10,21,13 September 2013
Flight," Movie should be called Alcohol and not Flight
","A good performance from Denzel Washington as the alcoholic flight captain starts with him having a sex scene with a 10+ bodied white prostitute, bushy beaver and all, and getting up in the morning for a couple of hits of liquor before he goes to work. Unfortunately, it's a shitty day and his 'plane soon flies into a nightmarish storm and develops problems that eventually, after a hair-raising few minutes that might put a few million Americans off flying ever again, Denzel is forced to fly upside down to try to rectify them. Finally, he wakes up alive and is rushed to hospital where, horror of horrors, he faces an investigation. There is a way out by blaming it his dead co-pilot, but he does not take it and confesses to alcoholism, getting a heavy prison sentence that will wreck his life. The movie is really about alcohol and not flight, and the title should really be changed. A good outing by Back to the Future director Robert Zemeckis.

Thirteen Days," The 20th century got worse and worse
","Its pretty shattering when Kennedy says he just read 'The Guns of August' (by Barbara Tuchman), because it reveals what a nightmare the 20th century was. I remember that Friday night in 1962 going to bed wondering if I'd get up in the morning. It was truly ghastly to feel that the whole civilised world could be blown to bits by lunatics like Gen. Curtis Lemay and Gen. Lemnitzer. Of course, the war party ultimately won by Kennedy getting assassinated, something that traumatized my whole life and has never been resolved. Gen. Lemnitzer got promoted to run the whole of NATO and the hideous Gladio programme that distorted European politics. All those guys are still there and they faked the 9/11 events to promote more war in the 21st century: it's so sad that the US public gets lied to again and again, and just laps it up or turns off. Kennedy was the one guy who had a chance to turn over a new leaf, and it was stolen from him --- and from his brother. This is a very sad film, in view of what transpired: although, sadly, few Americans are aware of what happened afterwards, or even before, such as the Bay of Pigs fiasco that led directly to this trauma, and got Lemnitzer fired by Kennedy. We now know that Kennedy was corresponding with Kruschev throughout.",7,0,1,16 September 2013
Pineapple Express," Aiming low pays off
","Watch an overweight egomaniac shouting and quivering his way through a ridiculous stoner script that makes the Marx Brothers look light-handed and almost elegant! The Three Stooges used to make trash like Pineapple Express, but their pictures mercifully averaged about ten minutes. This horror lasts nearly two hours --- have Americans got nothing better to do? Why doesn't someone puncture the inflated reputations of Seth Rogan, Adam Sandler, Rob Schneider, Judd Aparow and their ilk? Where on earth does the money come from for these kitsch celluloid monstrosities? Are they all financed by Ponzi schemes or drug racketeers? Pineapple Express is interstitial by-the-yard, made to fill up the space between commercials. It's the movie equivalent of junk food. All the 'laughs' and 'jokes' are imitations of the real thing and serve to validate the claim that Americans do not have a sense of humour, or at least one that reaches beyond the kindergarten. The giveaway in this picture is the obnoxious handling of the girl-friend role. She is casually cast aside and forgotten in a way that even the sexist movies of the 1950s would never have done. At least Cheech & Chong never had girl-friends, and Tommy Chong paid for his excesses with jail time --- something Seth Rogan will not be doing, I think.",2,5,12,19 May 2009
The Pursuit of Happyness," Corporate propaganda
","An intensely annoying one-dimensional study of perpetual disappointment, culminating in a highly questionable pay-off. Particularly in the wake of a stock-market blow-out of gigantic proportions, engineered by demented greed and unregulated irresponsibility, the depiction of a poor man achieving the status of a card-carrying merchant of pump-and-dump bondage as if he had attained the Promised Land is to say the least nauseating. But to frame the parable in a script that fails to deliver even the ghost of a sub-plot and tells its tale in a monotonous and-then-and-then-and-then series of setbacks with the occasional very implausible advance is a kind of torture. We know that the people behind the cameras are filming poverty from a position of comfortable corporate wealth. The whole movie is a very lengthy commercial for a profession that has contributed to destroying the post-war American way of life. This is corporate Hollywood at its most hawkish: to be avoided like the plague.",3,2,8,26 February 2009
Cinderella Man," Typical journey through the formatted mangle
","Another boxing movie? Can nobody think of anything new? Obviously the Depression era is total news to today's Americans, but nary a hint in this picture that an economic depression is anything more than a force of nature, like the weather. Nor is there the slightest indication of any solution of the New Deal kind --- heaven forbid.Braddock and his wife are depicted as the ideal working class couple: devoted, devout and dutiful. Yep, it's 'family values' territory. Wifey stays at home and takes in sewing (although we never see her sewing anything). Hubbie goes down and tries his luck as a navvy at the docks, when he can't get in a legal punch-up at Madison Square Gardens to earn some extra cash. It's enough to make the Bible belt go weak at the knees.When he is driven in desperation to take a welfare hand-out Braddock is depicted as profoundly humiliated and ashamed, and he actually turns up later with a wad of cash and pays it back --- as if his taxes and the human rights of his children did not merit the welfare payments. The conservative financiers of this picture (Ron Meyer/Universal and Miramax/Disney) would have lapped this up.I recommend to anyone fascinated by the climactic bout of this long, women-oriented flick to watch the video of the real thing that is included in the DVD package. They will see a sporting bout with no fireworks, and only a couple of sharp blows landed by either fighter. There's a clear winner on points and both fighters shake gloves at the end.In particular, they may be surprised to see in the genuine film the Baer character shown wearing a prominent Star of David on his trunks. Baer wore the star in honour of his Jewish father (although he was raised Catholic) when he fought Hitler's favourite boxer, Schmeling, and wore it thereafter. The star is unnoticeable in the movie's preposterously distorted version of the match, presumably because Baer was being built up as the big villain.In short the picture is a travesty, not only of the Depression era, but also of boxing history. Definitely avoidable.",2,17,30,21 March 2006
