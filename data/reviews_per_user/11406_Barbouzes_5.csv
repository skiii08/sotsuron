The Hangover," poor excuse for a comedy
","I did not laugh much watching this movie: the very few women in this script are presented as either shrews or whores (Heather Graham, what was your agent thinking when he booked you into this trash?!) and the men are hardly better treated, being all nincompoops and/or drunkards. Raunch and vacuity combined with bad writing and an abject storyline? Yes, 14 years-old and frat boys of all stripes, rejoice! I am not 14 years old, and offensive or demeaning material don't make me laugh. No, I could find not one hint of redeeming value to this rancid piece of 'entertainment'. For genuine and lasting laughs, may I suggest Groundhog Day, A Night at the Opera, Swingers, Bread And Chocolate, Some Like it Hot, L.A Story, or.. well, anything but The Hangover, really!",Null,1,2,7 March 2018
Knocked Up," Was this movie made in 1875?
","My main beef with this unfunny movie is its plot: a storyline where the heroine (Heigl) chooses to marry a complete stranger- numbskull Seth Rogen- from whom she got pregnant while drunk one night out-this as she knows nothing about him except he lives and thinks like a frat boy and has no visible means of supporting himself - is hardly comedy material: it is a tragedy. Let me rephrase that plot indeed: Heigl's character chooses to marry pot-smoking infantile loser Rogen just because she is pregnant from him and -who knows!- he might turn into a prince and a fabulous father once married! Oh d'ya think, really?? And in this script, the possibility of abortion as a (more than reasonable) exit from this life-crippling bump in the road is quickly brushed under the rug as...unthinkable, for some reason! What is this: 1875? Who really thinks in 2007 that a career girl is better off marrying a feckless dope-fiend rather than having an abortion? Methinks the director/writer of this irresponsible script (targeting a young audience), is either on the payroll of a Conservative church group, or a garden variety male chauvinist cretin.",Null,1,5,7 March 2018
La La Land," Charm and guts
","I saw LaLa Land in a real movie theater with a huge screen: it grabbed me from the first scene. That freeway dancing/singing opening scene is pure magic. To all the naysayers who did not find meat in this movie and complain about the lack of dancing skills from Gosling and Stone, I say: expert dancing and singing are irrelevant to the tale here. The relevance here is good music and a smart script, and... let them dance and sing it! The movie brought to my mind not Ginger and Fred and Gene and Cyd (this was clearly not the director's intention) but a French movie called 'The Young Girls of Rochefort' (1967, director Jacques Demy) where an older Gene Kelly makes a small but glorious appearance, and everyone else in the cast dances no better than you and me, but what a crazy delight it is. Just like in LaLa Land, the viewer is grabbed by lyrical tunes and invited to take a swirl into fantasy...while grounded in reality.",Null,0,5,14 June 2017
Parasite," Technically perfect, but the plot is weak
","Went and saw the film in a theater after it was re-released because of the Oscar win. And....like many reviewers here, I am baffled as to why this movie garnered so many accolades from Cannes to Hollywood. It is brilliantly filmed and well acted, but when it comes to its script, I can think of many more efficient, more subtle, less simplistic movies tackling class warfare with the purpose of entertainment. Indeed, Italian comedies of the 1960s and 70s were masters in that field, and they did it with fearless gusto, caustic laughs, perverse subtlety -and no artificial twists like in Parasite. I can watch over and over 'Bread And Chocolate' (1974, with Nino Mandredi) or any Ettore Scola movie of the same period (try 'Ugly, Dirty and Bad', 1976, for great fun!). I don't think i will remember Parasite in 3 days.",Null,2,4,21 February 2020
Minions," Loved it!
","People, I have never seen Despicable 1 nor Despicable 2: I don't watch children movies. I did not even know who Gru or the minions were before I saw the Minions' trailer -while attending another movie in the theater. But somehow that Minions trailer got my attention and did not leave me for a week: I simply had to see this cartoon that created such an original language for its protagonists. A linguistic grab from the get-go. I grabbed 3 friends with a sense of humor -we are all mature adults- and off we went to see Minions. We loved it! My personal take? MINIONS is not a children's film: it is way too good for kids! To start with, it is sprinkled with cultural references from Mozart' s Magic Flute to Prokofiev to the Beatles to the Monkees to the Who to Napoleon to Godzilla to James Bond to 60s politics and more. I am very sure the viewers who claim they were not entertained by this movie failed to notice the amazing level of culture placement, high and low, packed in that tiny plot. Pretty remarkable for a children's cartoon. Hey, a children's movie that does not bore the parents out of their gourd? Banana! Yes, the plot is silly, but the script is clever. Take the reference to the 'fake US lunar landing' every USSR citizen grew up with, for instance: it zips by for a micro second, but what a zest that mini scene packs. The 'Papagena' pick-up line by Bob to a fire hydrant in New York? What a beauty of a cultural mash up! But to me the hilarity palm goes first to the crazy linguistics of the 3 minions' speech. The 3 minions speak gibberish, but with such Esperanto gusto that all viewers understand what they mean. A difficult premise to start a film, but a gambit that works here against all odds. I don't know who the makers of this Minions cartoon are, but I think there is genius to their madness. The choice of soundtrack music was fun, the action was never flagging, the visuals were pleasant and often spectacular. No kidding: that movie was sweet candy to our ears and eyes, and, banana!, to our brains as well.",Null,3,5,23 July 2015
