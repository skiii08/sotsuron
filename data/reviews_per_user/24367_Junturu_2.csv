Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A few MINOR problems, but a good movie overall!
","Good movie!  I only have a few minor problems with it.  I would like to have seen some more character development, especially on the part of Darth Maul. Jar Jar Binks was annoying and could have done with a little less screen time, but he grew on me toward the end.  Overall, though, I thought the movie was very good, and the visual effects were stunning.  The action scenes were fast paced and full of tension.  I'm sure that I will like it even better the second time around, and there WILL be a second time!",9,5,7,24 May 1999
The Mummy," Skeptical at first, satisfied at end!
","Excellent movie!  I was skeptical at first, unsure of the casting choices for both the hero, and the heroine.  By the end of the movie however, I found that both actors had done a fine job.  The movie could have had a little more character development as far as the hero is concerned, but hey, what can you really expect from an action/adventure/horror movie? Overall, I thought the movie was excellent, and well worth the price of admission.",9,1,2,7 May 1999
