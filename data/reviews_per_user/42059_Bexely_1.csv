The Blair Witch Project," I've Never Seen A Worse Film In My Life
","I was really looking forward to seeing this film, everyone and every review I read said it was brilliant. I saw the film and I will never trust a film review again. I was not in the least bit scared at any point whatsoever during the film. I do not understand how people could call this the scariest film of all time. Fair Enough; 10 / 10 for originality and 8 / 10 for acting, but the basic premise of the film was simply boring. I was so bored with them wandering trough the woods arguing constantly.All in all, a terrible film.",Null,0,1,1 November 1999
