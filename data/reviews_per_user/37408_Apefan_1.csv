Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Needs to be viewed a second time to get full impact of it.
","Upon my initial viewing I was very disappointed and let down by  what Mr. Lucas had put up on the screen. I don't want to sound repetitive, but most of the negative reviews found in the major daily papers across North America were right and I agreed whole heartedly with them. However, upon a second viewing I found the film not to be as flat and devoid of the rich Star Wars layers we've all come to know and love, rather, I found a lot more subtlety, complexity and humanity. Jar Jar is still annoying, don't get me wrong, the film still has problems, but they're minor in comparison to viewing the picture as the first chapter of a six part series. Anyway, these comments have been left for those of you who didn't like it...I suggest you see it again, you may gain a new perspective.",7,0,0,21 May 1999
