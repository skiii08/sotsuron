Gremlins," the classic of classics <<< potential SPOILERZ>>>
","Few movie fans remember their first trip into movie-world. For me it was this 80's directed Joe Dante piece that was written by Chris Collumbus and produced by Steven Spielberg. O, the 80's, a truly jubilant era in history...the era of the gremlins. Given to him by his inventor father, a boy is introduced to Gizmo, a cute strange furry creature that sings, acts lovable and so forth. With Gizmo comes the rules and regulations that is to be strictly administered...No food after 00:00 - no daylight and no water. When this rules is broken, Gizmo first multiplies when the boy spills water over him, and then the evil offspring tricks him into giving them food after 00:00. All of this results in the newly born Gizmo's turning into Gorgoyle like demon-creatures causing havoc and living for chaos. Gremlins is a classic no matter how you look at it, loaded with social commentary, humor and the most important element of movies...love. an amazing fantastic and funny piece.",8,0,1,29 November 2005
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," The best X-men yet
","What to expect from Gavin Hood as director of Wolverine? I'll tell you,A more hardcore version of wolverine, totally bad-ass and fresh, a good way to start a spin off franchise. There's several new mutants, and unexpected old faces. There's a better sense of grittiness and the baggage of Brian Singer's installment and the lack of realism Ratner had is gone and Hood sculpt a clear beautiful film. This was a fantastic film and I enjoyed it very much. A sequel already!",8,10,28,29 April 2009
Constantine," Not bad at all.
","When I heard that Keanu's follow up on the Matrix was to be this movie, based on the popular underground comic by DC comics I was way skeptical.But alas, after seeing it, I have to say that I am immensely impressed by this movie.To be fair, it is definitely no Hellboy, its visual style lacks the sheer power of Guilermo del Toro, but for once, Keanu's under-performance actually works, especially for his character's 'devil-may-care' attitude, and where Hellboy is a cigar chomper, John Constantine is a chain smoker with lung cancer.It is certainly not the usual riff-raff comic crap like Elektra or Catwoman, and to be honestly clear...if I did not know John Constantine to be from the Hellblazer comic series I would have thought this to be just yet another ultra stylized action horror.Okay what made the movie for me...Keanu Reeves...in yet another unusual role, a character thats more human than human...Gavin Rossdale...in his debut role as a demon, with the appearance of a upper-class guppy. He was a show stealer in his scenes and I kind off wished that I could have seen more of him.that 'Stormare' guy from Fargo... as the Devil. Now kids, that was one hell of a show stealer, and the way he portrayed the devil was funny and yet very scary.all and all, the SFX, the monster designs, the sets and acting...everything worked well and it was one entertaining...scary but entertaining piece.",7,2,9,4 March 2005
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Mind blowing and breath taking.
","**Possible spoilers** First of all, I would like to say that this movie's special effects were great, and to some extent made up for the terrible acting from Hayden. The new worlds were excellent and the incredible art direction superb.I absolutely loved the lightsaber duels, and the fight of Obi VS jango were really cool. a plus for me was the incredible Jedi battle. Another, Jedi master Yoda kicking serious as against  ex- Dracula actor playing Dooku(Chris Lee)a minus must be the crappy love theme and the terrible sorry-ass role Hayden portrays. Natalie was a beaut and Coolman Sam, was amazing. the force was with this movie, and to all that say that this movie is a insult to anybodies childhood: Get a life or see this film again and again if only for the SFX and Yoda!",Null,1,2,26 March 2003
Predator," ArnoldVsPredator
","This is a action packed piece of work that was helmed perfectly byJohn Mactiernan, before his Die hard and Rollerball years.This is one of those movies that is timeless and quite brilliant to say the least and a bonus...two muscle bound governers kicking ass in it. The predator is a humanoid Alien and he's tall and mean. Uber monster creator Stan winston and Titanic helmer Jim Cameron designed this plasma rocket shooting blade wielding killer. The overall cewl design  is one of those things that made it worth while to watch. Mr Predator is way cooler than that unimaginative piece of trash, that would be the Alien.  Its is a punch and blast 'em up action flick and worth a rent.",Null,0,0,28 July 2004
Armageddon," a really good movie!
","Its hot when a asteroid is coming to annihilate earth, its even hotter when hotshot, die hard action man Bruce Willis is destined to stop it.In the same breath as 'deep impact' only bigger and better (with a higher body count) Ben Affleck is okay and everyone else delivers in the acting department. Concerning SFX everything is superb. This is a memorable end of the world movie and well worth a second, third and even fourth time watch!",Null,5,10,29 March 2003
"I, Robot"," Mr Proyas is a robot director
",Alex Proyas...with impressive hits such as the very first Crow movie and the superb Dark city ventures into sci-fi once more. But this movie is as artificial as the story and without any of elements that made the other two so impressive to me. The SFX is okay but a bit over whelming and it is only Will smith's brilliant acting and charisma that saved this movie from becoming a shaky battlefield earth type. It entertains however and is the kind of Blade runner Murder Mystery. It is even comparable to Minority report although it lacks the visual specs of that.For me it was ID4&Bladerunner combined and on heavy steroids and without the aliens.,Null,0,0,21 September 2004
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Something brilliant this ways come!
","This movie impressed me very much. After I saw the second movie I worried that the third story (that incidentally is my Fav. of the series) would be inferior to the first two because of a new director taking the helm, new actors in new roles etc. 
A role that worried me immensely was that of Sirius Black.What scared me the most was the rumors that Christian Bale was casted.
To my relieve the best actor from the UK...Gary Oldman was casted as Black and I was relieved. This movie was a brilliant piece of cinema and had everything...Brilliant SFX,superb acting, good direction and a more than decent script.
Alfonso Cuaron concocted an entertaining and intelligent brew of magical film that is superior to the efforts of the quasi-genius we know as Chris Collumbus. Yes I would have loved to see MR.Cuaron furthering the history of Hogwards but the man has higher ambitions and other movies. We are yet to see if Mike Newell is Uber enough to fill Cuaron's shoes at the helm of the next movie.",Null,0,0,16 August 2004
The Butterfly Effect," The choices we make.
","This movie was surprisingly good and its one of those movies that makes you think. Nothing in life comes without a price or certain sacrifice and with good bad also happens. This is but two themes that occurred to me after the movie and that is so true. Ashton Kutcher is not his usual self in this piece but an ordinary man with a wasted up childhood. It is however his quest for true love that forces him to begin his journey. I am not saying anything else, go and watch the darn movie.With the likes of Groundhog day and in some ways Back to the future.
********1/2 out of 10",Null,0,1,1 August 2004
Alien vs. Predator," Lacking everything that made the other six movies so incredible.
","I can still remember the sleepovers we had on weekends with my friends. We used to spend hours and hours watching the Alien and Predator movies. We even divided into two groups, the Alien fans and the predator fans. Me myself, I am a Predator fan, and was impressed when I heard that a movie was on the way that had both in it. But. Although the SFX were superb and the costumes incredible and the fight sequences breathtaking it lacked everything that made the other movies so amazing. There's not enough Predator action in it and far too much human presence and that silly little girl annoyed the living daylights out of me. It could have been worse it could have been better, but I found it extremely underwhelming.",6,0,2,26 February 2005
Batman Begins," The Batman we've been waiting for.
","After 2 crap attempts at a Batman movie, the studios finally gave the franchise an 8 year hiatus, and it seemed dead until Marvel rocked the industry, forcing this into production. With David S Goyer scripting it with the ever brilliant Chris Nolan behind him...they have created the Batman movie, fans have been waiting for. Christian Bale is a angry, moody and scary batman and not just a pussy such as the previous two. The villains are great, and everything seems perfectly balanced.It will entertain movie fans with its action and wit and will impress comic fans for the fine attention to detail and comic reference. In the end it entertains like only a batman movie can and I have new faith in DC and the most brilliant hero in comic history...Batman.",9,0,0,25 June 2005
Hellboy," One Hell of a movie...
","<<<POTENTIAL SPOILERS<<<<\ I have been waiting for this movie for a long time... ...and although I have not heard of the character or read a single page of the comic before Mr. Del Toro announced that he would helm this piece.It is a interesting piece, with a strong sense of visual style that consisted out of brilliant make up effects, incredible sets and audience friendly cinematography from Director of PhotographyGuillermo Navaro who also did the cinematography on another hell hero movie, spawn and Desperado. Yes, I was impressed by Guillermo Del toro's work and vision on this movie and he managed to convince me that Hellboy is a more humane character than most of the characters in this film and that (if blended tastefully) comedy can work in these kind of films. The plot was decent and everything worked well, though the ending came a bit fast...but it wasn't terrible. For a $80 mil movie this impressed the 'HELL' out of me and I wonder why other movies such as Catwoman with budgets of $110 and more was so terribly crap.",Null,0,1,10 October 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," a great film
","This movie was well worth the 12 month wait. But where the first film had great structure in the form of its story, this movie lacks all.I see this movie as an extention rather than a sequel.A plus for me was the symbolism, the great use of Special effects and the incredible battle of helmsdeep. Sean Astin's acting is improving and Viggo was a truly underappreciated actor until now. Mr Jackson have surely done a great job on this movie. I read the books some years ago, but I read all at once, and I think Jackson delivered totally.Its obvious that some hard core fans of the book would be p***ed at the end product of this movie. But I think that fans in general adored and LOVED it.",9,0,0,26 March 2003
Saw II," If you SAW the first, you have to see this.
","It is not every year that you get a sequel worthy of the first, not even to mention cinema, especially if the original was a mega sleeper hit such as SAW.Most of us expected a lame, unintelligent piece of rubbish, rushed and made in production line fashion, merely created to cash in on the unexpected success of the first, some even expected it to be a pg13 rendering of the original.Thank heavens we were all expecting the wrong thing.Saw2 was unexpectedly good, and with its complex plot and claustrophobic cinematography it certainly kept me on the edge of my seat for most of the full duration of the film.Yes it is quite bloody violent in a grisly way and extremely disturbing, but I should tell you that the blood and violence is not just there to shock, it serves the story and entertains the masochistic side of all.I will not divulge anything about the movie only that...If you liked the first, you will love this so go and see this if this is your cup of coffee.",8,0,1,22 January 2006
Saw," Not even remotely as terrible as the poster...
","I saw the poster but have never heard of this 'saw' and because there was in fact nothing else to see I bought tickets for the show. I was caught off-guard by this, it is very-very bloody, extremely violent and immensely dark. Cary Elves stars as Dr Lawrence Gordon, well acted and charismatic it is hard imagining him as Robin hood men in tights after a performance he gives us in this film. The plot is very interesting, the concept brilliant...it kind off reminded me of 'Seven' and in other ways 'Texas Chainsaw massacre' and even 'scream' It will gross you out and scare you to death if you are one that is faint of heard, but it will in fact entertain the hell out of you if you like scary-scary movies. The verdict is that this is a mega sleeper hit, much better than the terrible poster and entertaining.",8,0,1,19 September 2005
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," uber British and on the way for one of the spots on the top20 of all time!
","As I saw the poster I read the names Daniel Radcliffe, Michael Gambon, Alan Rickman and of course Ralph Fiennes. This was just the movie I've been waiting for, but three months prior to this day I read the novel, heard that the film force behind the movie had cut loads of subplot and so forth...was I still excited???Hell yea...its Harry potter Ladies and gentleman.It would seem as if each movie since 'Azkaban' have been reinvented and rewritten for the silver screen. Is it the case with this one? yes it is. Did I like this movie? Certainly. Mike Newell directed his version of HArry potter in a way that only a Brit can...in a uber British way, with a dark murky atmosphere and a uncanny dosage of British anarchy.Unlike the first two movies, that was a straight forward artificial pieces, driven by a quasi sense of magic and acceptable special effects, this film, is more like the third that raised the bar for quality of content.Unlike the first two that was utterly claustrophobic concerning the school and castle, Newell shows us that Hogwards is gigantic,enormous and a colossal school that is much more than a castle. In this movie,everything goes, anyone goes and the once goody-two-shoes atmosphere of the other movies seems faded. Enough of that. Brendan Gleeson was superb as Alastor Moody, Albus Dumbledore seemed more human in this volume, more tense and exactly like an actual headmaster. The main three were amazing and it was certainly great to see our silver screen heroes at it again. Ron were superb as the sidekick-like friend trying to find a voice of his own.Hermione- dazzling as the swan who is (at a fast pace) becoming a lady, that is caught in the midst of a love triangle. Harry- the everyman person, was well acted by Daniel Radcliffe and he carried the film well.The main attraction was however Ralph Fiennes, without the benefit of a nose and in thick make-up and robes. He was mesmerizing as Lord Voldemort, a guy so evil and arrogant you love to hate the hell out of him. Yes movie fans, I loved this movie...saw it twice on opening day, and I am going to see it again tomorrow.It entertains like only Harry potter movies can and David Heyman produced something amazing and most of all entertaining, for us. Although scraps of subplots and unresolved themes were almost littered through the movie, it did not break the film. And although many people reckon that Radcliffe cant act, they forget that Elijah Wood cant even spell the word not in one movie and not in any of the LOTR movies.I think Daniel Radcliffe was brilliant, and though I believe this movie to be better than the mediocre pieces of slime that is the first two, I cant truly say that it is better than 'Azkaban'...for Cuaron managed his piece loads better than Newell managed this utterly difficult piece. But still its worth every show you can lay eyes on...so go out there, see the movie and write your review.",9,0,0,2 December 2005
War of the Worlds," Pretty amazing.
","The first glimpse of this picture reminded me quite a lot of ID4 and I must be honest when I say that I did not look forward to see this film, but alas my brother dragged me to the cinema to watch it, and I must say that I found it pretty amazing and much better than ID4. Many may debate that ID4 was released almost a decade ago and that it would be unfair to compare the two but even so, I find WOTW more believable, its got a much better script and the acting, O the acting, more than good. It has been a while since Tom Cruise acted something less than a super-tough guy and in this his character are purely humane. Dakota Fanning is awesome as are Tim Robbins. This was a very interesting picture, the SFX great and everything amazingly good. Consider me entertained.",8,1,3,8 July 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The best of the new.
","After the fairly good but terribly received film that was Attack of the clones fans was skeptical about the overall quality of the third and final chapter in the star wars saga. But alas I found Revenge of the sith an action packed, fast paced tragedy and the best of the new trilogy. The SFX were incredible as always, the fight sequences amazing but Hayden as Anakin was utterly crap and with Ewan Mcgreggor as Obi-Wan and even the king of cool Sam JAckson as Jedi master MAce WIndu in the cast, he seemed out of place and odd. Yoda was a treat and the way Lucas structured this piece to connect with 'a new hope' brilliant. Hats of to Lucas, the ultimate Jedi of our time.",9,1,3,2 July 2005
Fantastic Four," potential spoilers but more than incredible...fantastic!!!
","And the superhero movie for this month is...The fantastic4. Weary and loaded with a fair amount of skepticism I entered the cinema today. TO see a guy who flames on, another who stretches, a big monster (with more heart than Meg Ryan at the end of all her movies, combined) who smashes things and a amazingly beautiful Jessica Alba who (makes like most one-night-stands...)disappears. I must be honest that I found myself laughing and being the one thing movie lovers should be...entertained. Yes...the so-so director of 'Barbershop' helmed this piece decently but not as dark as 'Batman Begins' or as moody and over-serious as 'the hulk' no my dear movie fan, Mr. Story took a more lighthearted approach to helm this movie and I must say that this is very entertaining and will appeal to the entire family. I find this as a cross-over between the fun/wacky element in spiderman and the kind of scifi/action element of X-men...all blended nicely into a package that is without the potential corniness. Yes, this movie was more than incredible and actually fantastic...times four.",8,0,0,15 July 2005
