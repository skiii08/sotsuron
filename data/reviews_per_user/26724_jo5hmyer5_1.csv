The Blair Witch Project," Wow, what did I just watch?
","So yeah I finally just watched The Blair Witch Project for the first time ever, and I realize this review is about 15 yrs too late, but I honestly can say, that was one of the worst pieces of garbage ever captured on video. and the fact that it made roughly $10,500 for every dollar spent on making it makes my head want to implode then explode consecutively....I cannot understand how an hr and 20 minutes of 3 completely idiotic people with no sense of direction, or what they are trying to achieve or even how to carry on a normal conversation with each other without freaking out and yelling F*** every 5 seconds makes for a successful movie. There wasn't even a payoff at the end after putting up with all that BS. If i'm missing something please enlighten me. And I realize at the time this was a new cutting edge style of film making, with a focus on character development. Aside for some occasional moments of intensity, seriously, there is nothing about this movie that redeems itself...ugh.....",2,4,6,8 October 2014
