The Blair Witch Project," Best Comedy of the Summer!
","Hands-down, the best comedy of the summer!  Oh wait, I just saw a commercial for Blair Witch and apparently it's 'the scariest movie ever' ?C'mon people, the only stunning thing about this film is the amount of $$ it's making.  It's not 'scary', NOT AN ORIGINAL CONCEPT, and overall just plain boring.  By far, one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  To even mention BWP in the same sentence as Exorcist, Shining, Psycho etc., is an insult.Rating: 1/10",1,1,2,10 August 1999
