The Rock," Renegade Marines?
","Renegade Marines. The concept is almost an oxymoron. Yet the premise of this action film is that a rogue marine general Ed Harris, steals some rockets with nerve gas and then takes over Alcatraz island which is now a tourist attraction and threatens to launch strikes into the San Francisco bay area unless his financial demands are met.After a Navy Seal team is massacred in trying to take the island back it's up to an aged ex-convict named Sean Connery and a chemical weapons specialist Nicholas Cage to save San Francisco from the USMC albeit a very renegade bunch of them.The Rock is strictly for action junkies who don't care about plot or improbable situations. In fact the film should have been familiar to the first James Bond of the silver screen. Sean Connery had some more realistic situations in those films than he does here.Of course fans of Sean Connery will pay to see him in anything and I'm certainly one of them. Nicholas Cage tries his very best to give the dialog a little meaning.If I had a favorite in this film however it's the Navy Seal commander Michael Biehn. It's a good, sincere performance in a Thanksgiving Day special of a film.For fans of the players above only.",4,4,8,29 January 2007
The Devil's Advocate," It's All A Matter Of Free Will
","You will never hear the devil's viewpoint argued better than in and by The Devil's Advocate. Although Keanu Reeves holds his own in this film, this piece of cinema is an Al Pacino show.Pacino must have loved playing the devil, it shows in every word, in every gesture in his performance. Since Marlowe and Goethe cooked up Faust, the devil has had a great group of players taking on the part. People like Ray Milland, Ray Walston, Walter Huston have all done well with old Scratch, but no one ever tops Pacino in this.That's probably because through cultural and religious restraints, the devil HAS to lose in the end. In this film, it's not necessarily the case. Keanu argues the Bible says he loses in the end, but Pacino says quite properly, consider the source.Keanu Reeves is a hotshot trial lawyer from Florida who has rung up sixty three acquittals of various folks arrested. He's come to the attention of a very powerful law firm, headquartered in New York and they want to take him in. The senior partner is Al Pacino, a most mysterious fellow who moves among the rich and mighty with ease.Just how powerful Reeves has no idea and why Pacino is so interested in him particularly is also a puzzle. The reasons are quite shocking when he finds out.Although a talented supporting cast was gathered for this film, Pacino just overpowers this group with his performance. Even Reeves who actually has more screen time can barely keep pace.And the ending has to be seen to be believed. Let's just say that old Scratch has more tricks in him than Harry Houdini, David Blaine, David Copperfield and all the rest of that magician crowd put together.As he says, vanity is his favorite sin, it apparently is what trips mankind up every time, individually and collectively.",9,13,17,7 July 2007
The King's Speech," George VI And His Therapist
","With what I understand was the approval of the Royal Family, The King's Speech sets out to set the historical record straight about the father of the present Queen Elizabeth. George VI of the United Kingdom never thought he would be the ruling monarch, but when the challenge came, he rose to it. He was the second surviving son of George V and Queen Mary and like the present royal princes, Andrews and Edward, did the usual good will things on behalf of the Royal Family, substituting whenever the monarch or his brother the Crown Prince was not available.For Colin Firth as George, life took an incredible bounce as his father Michael Gambon as George V said it would if the Prince of Wales later Edward VIII took the throne. Given his cavalier attitude and irresponsibility about assuming his duties George V knew something would happen.The something was American divorc√©e Wallis Warfield Simpson played here by Eve Best ever so briefly, but deliciously. Her erotic technique could not be beat and that's what got Guy Peace as Edward VIII panting after her. Her friendship with Nazis and their collaborators worried quite a few in the British establishment. I'm glad that The King's Speech brought this one, I'm a firm believer that once all documents are released Stanley Baldwin and the rest of the cabinet who stood with him against this marriage will be heroes for posterity.We in America have long been big believers in that myth perpetuated about the Windsors about the king who gave up his throne for the woman he loved. This film is the Royal Family's Way of setting the historical record straight.But Colin Firth did have an incredible problem of stammering and could not cure it. George VI never really did, but after trying many people his wife Helena Bonham Carter in the film came upon Geoffrey Rush who was not a professional therapist. He was something better it turned out, an actor and an intuitive psychologist to boot. His scenes with Firth trying to limit the stammer are the best in the film.Second best in the film are the scenes of Firth and Bonham-Carter with their two daughters, the older of whom became the present Queen. She's the only one left who was present at these events. After the playboy Edward VIII, the Royals became a beloved institution of family stability during George VI's reign. They stayed in London, in Buckingham Palce, during the Blitz and toured the city constantly keeping up the morale of the populace. No ruler with real political power did more for his people.The King's Speech got four Oscars for Best Picture, Best Actor for Colin Firth, Best Director for Tom Hooper and for David Seaton's Original Screenplay. It had a flock more nominations including Best Supporting Actor and Actress for Geoffrey Rush and Helena Bonham-Carter. One role should not be overlooked either, that of Derek Jacobi as an obsequious Archbishop of Canterbury. I wasn't familiar with him, but was he really that much of toady?And this review from this American viewer from a country that got rid of the British monarchy dedicates this review to George VI of the United Kingdom. Winston Churchill led the government, but George VI led his people in their darkest hour, never forget that.",9,1,2,15 March 2011
Despicable Me 2," Set A Villain To Catch A Villain
","After being nabbed in the original Despicable Me, Steve Carrell as Gru is given a kind of furlough from villainy and attempts to go straight with his kids. But a top secret laboratory is stolen from its Arctic site, I mean the whole building is just lifted from the ground with a giant magnet and transported to wherever. Those research facilities in the wrong hands could have a devastating impact on humankind so we set a villain to catch a villain.Kristen Wiig returns as Lucy, agent from the anti-villain league and truth be told she's enjoying the assignment though even because she brought Gru down in the first Despicable Me, she has a thing for him.As for Gru he suspects that supervillain El Macho whom he runs into in a mall hasn't retired from the villainy business. I really did like what Benjamin Bratt did with his character. Sounds like he was having a great old time with the part.Despicable Me 2 is a nice animated feature good for the whole family.",7,1,2,23 July 2013
Saturday Night Fever," Staying Alive To Jive
","Saturday Night Fever holds a special place in the hearts of all the residents of Brooklyn. Besides being the visual symbol of the disco era, it is also the best filmed recollection of the post Dodgers era of Brooklyn which sad to say is still going on. Brooklyn does not have the Dodgers any more and in fact the 2001 club is no longer there, but you can see a lot of the area that was photographed in Bay Ridge and Fort Hamilton. I could even show you the places on tour.But it's the music and story of Saturday Night Fever that has made it an enduring classic. John Travolta left the sweathogs of Welcome Back Kotter and broke out as a major film star playing Tony Manero in this film. Travolta's a kid working at a paint store in a dead end job, hanging out with his dead end friends who has only one great talent going for him. On Saturday night when he goes to the 2001, he's king of the dance floor. He can get just about any girl he wants and quite a few would like him, especially Donna Pescow, but Travolta's got his eye on Karen Lynn Gorney who is of Italian background like himself, but has real career aspirations as a dancer. Travolta and Gorney agree to dance together, but John just can't let it go at that.The only Oscar that Saturday Night Fever was nominated for was John Travolta as Best Actor. He lost that year to Richard Dreyfuss in The Goodbye Girl. Travolta does a great job in playing Tony Manero, a kid who over the course of the film realizes there is a great big world out there beyond his neighborhood. A lot of things help convince him of that, his involvement with Gorney, his dancing, his dead ending friends one of whom meets with real tragedy.Special mention should go to Barry Miller playing Bobby C, one of the Travolta friends. He's such a sad case trying so desperately to belong with the crowd. They tolerate him basically because he's got the car and he takes the gang where they want to go. The Motion Picture Academy has committed some god awful blunders in its time. But one of the worst was its total non-recognition of the music of the Gibb Brothers and the other music from Saturday Night Fever. Saturday Night Fever was incredibly not even nominated for Best Musical Score. Not one of the songs from the BeeGees and others was nominated for Best Original Song from a Motion Picture. The winner that year was You Light Up My Life, a nice song, but has never had the enduring popularity of any number of the BeeGee tunes like How Deep Is Your Love, Staying Alive, You Should Be Dancing, or Night Fever.The Brooklyn shown in Saturday Night Fever is a Brooklyn that most grew up with. Only old codgers like myself remember the Dodgers, but Saturday Night Fever is Brooklyn for the next couple of generations.",8,7,9,26 January 2009
Moneyball," 'They Get On Base'
","I have to admit that Moneyball is one unique baseball film. Usually films are about players like Lou Gehrig, Grover Cleveland Alexander, or Dizzy Dean to name three of the most successful players that successful films were made about. But our protagonist/hero is Billy Beane here, a general manager who in his own way adopted a revolutionary approach to baseball that some consider as significant as Branch Rickey inventing the farm system.Beane is played here by Brad Pitt and he was a journeyman player who was given a scouting job in the Oakland Athletics organization which was the last team he played for. Beane gradually rose through the ranks and was now general manager at the turn of this century. What to do in the way of competing in this day of free agency with teams who have fabulously wealthy and spending owners like the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox in the American League.The answer comes from Jonah Hill who Pitt hires away from the Cleveland Indians organization and the key is on base percentage. However you get on base, hit, walk, error, hit by pitch or the occasional passed ball by a catcher, you're on and in a position to score. No flashy hitters with huge contracts in the Beane system, just get on base and get moved around. Of course on screen it works and the Oakland Athletics enjoy a sprint of success in the last decade. But imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and now a lot of teams are copying the Athletics. I could critique the system, but this is for movie reviews not a sports writer's column. And the film is a tribute to two men and the system they fashioned. Brad Pitt the visionary general manager and Jonah Hill the bean counter statistician who is an integral part of the success.Moneyball is unfortunately not a film that who are not sports fans or even baseball fans only can really appreciate. Still that's a wide selection of viewers it can relate to. It received six Oscar nominations including Best Picture, Best Actor for Brad Pitt and Best Supporting Actor for Jonah Hill. There's a nice performance by Philip Seymour Hoffman as field manager Art Howe. Hoffman's range continually amazes. You can hardly believe this is the same man who also got an Oscar for playing Truman Capote. He disappears into roles better than any other actor since Paul Muni.A film for baseball fans, but that's a large audience pilgrim.",7,1,1,2 March 2012
National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Cibola
","Conspiracy theorists will love National Treasure: The Book Of Secrets because it will give one plausible reason to affirm all the paranoid things one already believes in and add a few more. Imagine the fabled Cibola, City of Gold, which several conquistadors spent lots of time and money searching for, being positively real and the clues being in Buckingham Palace and the White House? Does it get more conspiratorial than that?Nicholas Cage, Diane Kruger, Justin Bartha, Jon Voight, and Harvey Keitel all repeat their roles from the first National Treasure. Because part of the riddle is in some Indian language symbols, the intrepid treasure hunters have to call in Voight's estranged wife and Cage's mother Helen Mirren. That raises all kinds of issues not related to treasure hunting.Ed Harris is the villain here, he starts the ball rolling by claiming to have an authentic missing page of John Wilkes Booth's diary which implicates Voight and Cage's ancestor in the Lincoln assassination. Of course Harris has an ulterior motive in doing that, to get the treasure hunters working because their historical knowledge is greater than his. In the end however he proves not to be as big a villain as the group from the first National Treasure and that's quite a let down.As for Cibola, let's just say that the government has put quite the marker on the site.If you're a history lover or a conspiracy theorist this film will grab your attention. But it's not up to the standard of the first one.",5,1,1,1 January 2011
Million Dollar Arm," Indians want to be Pirates
","The story of how Babe Ruth took an all star team to tour Japan in 1934 is well known and how baseball spread there. Now Japanese stars are coming to the USA for the big bucks and have become accepted. Latin Americans were here before and now we have Australians playing in the Big Show as well.I imagine it was only a matter of time before someone sought to popularize baseball in India, a place where British cricket is played and is the popular team sport. This is a true story about how Jon Hamm's character went to India as a business promotion to bring back a pair of the Indian equivalent of Jackie Robinson.Million Dollar Arm follows the Japanese tradition in that Japan came to Major League baseball via the pitching route. It was years before position players started to fill the ranks of the Major Leagues. I guess Hamm's character figured that baseball could wait for an Indian shortstop or outfielder. It was a pitcher that the contest was geared for and two prospects Hamm got in Suraj Sharma and Maddur Mittal.The two Indian actors were quite charismatic and appealing as the Indian kids who carry a lot of hopes and dreams with them. They might not have to face what Jackie Robinson faced or what the first out gay player in the Major Leagues might face, but still the culture shock for these two is quite real.Two other roles of note are Bill Paxton as a baseball coach who tutors them in the fine art of pitching and Adam Arkin as the somewhat jaded old baseball scout who can tell the quality of the fast ball by its pop in the glove.Of course sooner or later some Indian kid will develop the knuckleball of Hoyt Wilhelm and Arkin's theories will blow up.I'm always up for a good baseball movie and Million Dollar Arm is a very good one indeed.",9,2,3,20 May 2014
Angels & Demons," Doctor Langdon Is Back
","It's now been three years since Tom Hanks as Dr. Robert Langdon solved the mystery of Jesus and Mary Magdalene and that Audrey Tautou from The DaVinci Code is their descendant. You wouldn't think that for one minute the Catholic Church would call on this guy in a crisis. But that's what The DaVinci Code sequel Angels & Demons would have us believe. After all this guy basically ripped apart the linchpin of the Christian faith.But now four cardinals have been captured on the eve on the conclave to elect a new pope and with some jurisdictional disputes raging, some in the Vatican have called in Tom Hanks. The culprit is that notorious secret society the Illuminati and not only have they captured four of the cardinals and are threatening to kill them, but are threatening to blow up the Vatican itself with an anti-matter device. The anti-matter was stolen from the supercollider in Geneva which brings scientist Ayelet Zurer into the picture as well.So with Hanks trying to decipher codes from the Vatican archives in much the same way Nicholas Cage was working in National Treasure and Zurer around to see the bomb doesn't go off, it's a race against time to save the Vatican and its cardinals.Director Ron Howard and Tom Hanks did a great job with The DaVinci Code, but in the sequel they came up way short. Church politics can get good and nasty sometimes, but this one was way too much for my taste.Better this sequel just not have been made.",4,8,14,23 May 2009
The Legend of Bagger Vance," The great game of golf
","What I really liked about The Legend Of Bagger Vance is the great care that director Robert Redford did in evoking the feel and ambiance of Savannah, 
Georgia in the Great Depression. I really did feel like I was back in that time
watching this story about a match between the greatest golfers of their era,
Bobby Jones and Walter Hagen. A match where a local man, Matt Damon
gave the greats a run for their money.Harve Presnell one of Savannah's leading citizens has invested everything in
the development of a new golf course and when stock market crashed he loses
everything and takes his own life. Staving off her father's creditors Charlize
Theron vows that this course will open and will feature a match between the
two best of their time Bobby Jones and Walter Hagen. However for a little local rooting interest the townsfolk insist on a local player in with the big
guys.Said local player is Matt Damon who went to war in 1917 and came out bitter,
disillusioned and drunk. Back in the day people in Savannah thought Damon
might have a future in professional golf then really at its beginning. But he
hasn't swung a club in a decade.This entire story is seen through the eyes of young J. Michael Moncrief who in
time grows up to be Jack Lemmon who appears at the beginning and end of the film in his farewell role. Lemmon also provides the narration for The Legend Of Bagger Vance.Damon eventually accepts, but it's only when Will Smith comes along playing
the title role as a most mysterious man who offers to be his caddy that Damon
plays. Smith imparts some real life lessons that both Damon and young Moncrief take in.Other than Will Smith the only time you see any black people in the film is when Damon is discovered, living reclusively, drinking heavily and in a poker
game with several black people. In segregated Savannah of the Twenties while
you see a genteel version of the South it still has its racist mores and only Damon and Moncrief break them. The only black face you see in the crowds
at the celebrated match is Will Smith's.Joel Gretsch as Bobby Jones and Bruce McGill as Walter Hagen exactly fit the
conception I had of both Jones and Hagen. They were as different as baseball
legends Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig. Hagen was a cheerful hedonist who was
quoted as saying he didn't want to be a millionaire just live like one. Jones was
the epitome of clean living and good sportsmanship. Among those covering
the match was Grantland Rice played here by Lane Smith in his farewell role.How the match comes out is for you to watch the film for. But some life lessons are learned by all the players.",7,2,3,24 March 2018
Vertigo," Detective Obsessed
","Although it got at best mixed reviews when first released, Vertigo is now considered one of Alfred Hitchcock's classic films. A tribute to the players, the director, and the composer of that haunting musical score that will stay with you forever.The music is probably more important here than in most films, let alone most Hitchcock films. Because for most of the first half of the film and a great deal of the second half, it is without dialogue. In fact Kim Novak does not have a spoken line until about 48 minutes into the little more than 2 hour feature. She's under James Stewart's surveillance and the whole story of his growing obsession with her is told through his facial expressions and through Bernard Herrmann's music.Stewart is a cop retired on disability who is hired by an old college friend Tom Helmore to follow his wife. Helmore tells Stewart a tale about his wife falling under the spirit of her dead great grandmother who committed suicide. The wife he's following is played by Kim Novak. Novak in fact makes a suicide attempt and by jumping into San Francisco bay and Stewart jumps in and saves her.In a brief prologue the reason for Stewart's disability is told. While on the police force, he lost a man while pursuing the suspect in a rooftop chase. Another cop was killed trying to save Stewart who had slipped and was hanging on to a roof gutter for his dear life. After that Stewart acquired an understandable fear of heights with accompanying dizziness, vertigo.Later on at an old mission which has significance for Novak's family, Novak runs up to the top of the bell tower and Stewart because of his Vertigo can't pursue her to prevent her from jumping off and taking her life.Later on he spots Kim Novak again with a different color hair and this time essentially stalks her until they meet. By now he's totally obsessed with the dead Novak who he fell in love with.Alfred Hitchcock is plumbing some depths of the human psyche in Vertigo. Certainly good old all American Jimmy Stewart would not be one you would think of casting as a voyeur and a stalker. But he pulls off the performance in probably the film with the least dialogue Alfred Hitchcock ever made since sound came in.Kim Novak is hauntingly beautiful in Vertigo, she has to be or the whole plot would make no sense. Barbara Bel Geddes is in this also as Stewart's girl friend who finds herself losing him to an obsession with a ghost. She also serves as a sounding board for Stewart as he expresses some of his feelings to her.This was the first of two films Stewart and Novak made together. Ironically enough the second one, Bell Book and Candle, is about a witch played by Novak who actually uses witchcraft to ensnare Stewart. Given Stewart's obsession with Novak in Vertigo, if Hitchcock had thrown in witchcraft into the plot, the audience would certainly have believed it.Of course this is an Alfred Hitchcock film and therefore not all is as it seems. I can't sat any more, but there are no happy endings for anyone in this haunting film.",9,121,181,3 December 2005
Black Swan," Losing Yourself In The Darkness Of The Part
","First off let no one think that if they see Black Swan from 2010 that earned Natalie Portman a Best Actress Oscar that they are looking at a remake of the Tyrone Power swashbuckling classic. Instead this film which has a setting in a ballet company is an interesting combination of plot themes from A Double Life and All About Eve.Company choreographer Victor Cassel chooses promising newcomer Natalie Portman to be the lead in his new production of Swan Lake to succeed his long time star Winona Ryder who is not taking her forced retirement easy. Portman has been Ryder's Eve Harrington, but Portman also has an Eve in her life as well, the younger and talented Mila Kunis. A lot of fine roles for women in this film.Portman is no doubt talented, but she's dealing with a lot of issues of paranoia, a lot of it instilled by her mother Barbara Hershey. She starts losing herself in the dark complexities of the Black Swan as surely as Ronald Colman did with Othello in A Double Life. How it all works out for all the women you have to see Black Swan.And you'll like what you see. It's hard to miss the elements in those classics that I've cited in Black Swan. But if you're going to borrow, borrow from the best. And since an Oscar came Ronald Colman's way and one of her 10 nominations came Bette Davis's way, Natalie Portman sure had a substantial role that she played beautifully.The real surprise for most viewers I think will be Mila Kunis who played the vapid Jackie on That Seventies Show. Kunis provided one of the great lines from television in that show when she stated that no one would deter her from her career goal to be Dallas Cowboys Cheerleader. She should have gotten some Oscar recognition herself for the Eve Harrington type role she plays here.Black Swan is the best film about ballet since the Anne Bancroft/Shirley MacLane classic The Turning Point from the Seventies. Try to see this one by all means.",9,11,18,9 July 2011
Love and Death," Tolstoy Takes A Beating
","Watching Love And Death today I had the feeling that back when Woody Allen was going to Midwood High School in Brooklyn, a few years before I did, he was forced to do a book report on War And Peace and hated it. He vowed to get even with Tolstoy and all the rest of those heavy Russian dramatists and in Love And Death I do believe he succeeded. And if you ever were forced to sit through all that turgid prose and heavy dramatics than Love And Death is the film you've longed for. The time is the Napoleonic Wars and the flower of Russian manhood is answering the colors. But Woody comes from a different patch than the other flowers bloomed in and he's not that crazy about sacrificing for old mother Russia.The overall tone of Love And Death is a homage to Groucho Marx and years earlier I could have seen the Marx Brothers doing something like Love And Death with a bit more creative control, just like what Woody Allen has with his movies. But the military scenes were out of the Bob Hope school of cowardice playbook. Lest anyone think that only Russian literature got a good satire, Allen includes a take off on Eugene O'Neill's Strange Interlude as Allen and Diane Keaton both go into those stage soliloquys about what the future holds for them as a couple. Love And Death a must for Woody Allen and a missionary film for those looking to convert someone to being a Woody Allen fan.",8,8,8,23 May 2011
Frost_Nixon," 'I Gave Them A Sword'
","When you take on the role of someone so identifiable in the public mind as Richard M. Nixon you'd better have the acting chops for the job. Nixon is so easy to caricature whether gently or acidly. After the Watergate scandal broke, the caricatures became more and more acid indeed. That was the challenge that Frank Langella met and overcame. In his performance he never once slipped into a David Frye like imitation, though honestly I kept expecting him to throughout the film as I watched it. He was Nixon right down to the dark recesses of his troubled soul. A terribly private man who chose the most public of all professions to engage in. A man of poor background who could not forget the snubs of adolescence. A brilliant man capable of initiatives in governance like the opening of Communist China. A cynical man because he advocated policies that kept China closed for years to America. The other half of Frost/Nixon is the charming British talk show host David Frost who bet his whole career on getting an interview with one of the most despised figures in the world and getting him to open up on television. In retrospect it was obvious that Frost was the guy for the job. Someone in the hard news field like Mike Wallace would never have gotten in the door to see Nixon.Unlike Nixon, David Frost is still with us and apparently voiced no complaints about Michael Sheen, not of the Sheen/Estevez acting clan of the USA, playing him. Sheen also responds with a good characterization and captures David Frost as I remember him from the Seventies and Eighties.Frost/Nixon ran for 137 performances last year on Broadway and director Ron Howard had the good sense to cast Langella and Sheen in the roles they originated there. Langella got a Tony Award and will probably get an Oscar nomination.Best scene in the film is an inebriated Richard Nixon calling David Frost one night and revealing one nasty side to Frost. Sheen's facial expressions as Langella raves on the phone tell everything.Kevin Bacon is in the cast as Nixon's chief aide in retirement Jack Brennan. There's a bit of Oliver North in Bacon's portrayal, the loyal former Marine who can't forget who was his commander-in-chief during Vietnam and appreciates him if no others do. Brennan also can't forget he felt a stranger in his own country with people despising him for his service. In the recent election, surviving Nixon people supported former POW John McCain against Republican rivals for the nomination. In my state of New York, McCain's campaign was headed by Nixon's son-in-law Edward Cox. Bacon's loyal Brennan is ironic also because it was Nixon's aides, aides mostly acquired in his eight years between his defeat by John F. Kennedy in 1960 and his election in 1968 that were the ones that did Nixon in. I've often wondered if Nixon had been elected in 1960 would we have seen a Watergate because all the names associated with that scandal were people who would have never been in a Nixon presidency then.Frost/Nixon is a fascinating look at a tortured soul who wound up in the most powerful position in the world. There may be some Academy gold for this film and you can also believe that Nixon will continue to fascinate people for years.",9,3,5,1 January 2009
Gremlins," No Water, No Sunlight, No Feeding After Midnight, Or Else
","During the year that Gremlins came out I remember watching the World Series that year and at a certain point when a number of bad plays were ruining the San Diego Padres against the Detroit Tigers, Joe Garagiola remarked that Gremlins were cursing the Padres. Garagiola gave a nice plug to what was one of the best films of that year and horribly neglected by the Academy.Hoyt Axton wants to get an unusual pet from merchant Keye Luke called a Mogwai, but he won't sell. Nevertheless his grandson John Louie does sell the cute little Mogwai to him with three conditions that have to be met in their keeping. No water, no sunlight, and no feeding after midnight or terrible consequences will result.Of course the family is delighted with the new pet especially twenty something son Zach Galligan who is the really responsible one in the family. But things do happen and on that Christmas Eve all three conditions are broken and as a result a horde of ugly little Gremlins start running amuck.I do love this film so because it strikes so many emotions at the same time. You love the little Mogwais, but you are terrified at what they've become. The Gremlins are horrifying, but at the same time you will laugh hysterically at what they do to some people. Polly Holliday, fresh from the Alice series on television plays a mean woman in the grand tradition of Margaret Hamilton. What the Gremlins have in store for her is priceless.Gremlins marked the farewell performances of both Scott Brady and Edward Andrews both of whom graced many a film and unlike some character actors from the studio days never stopped working. It's because both of these guys were memorable on the screen.Director Joe Dante, writer Chris Columbus and most of all producer Steven Spielberg who imparted his always imaginative vision to this film have given us a great one, especially around the time of Halloween. Gremlins is one timeless classic for the big and small screen.",9,1,2,22 October 2010
The Incredible Hulk," When He's In Hulk Mode, Watch Out
","With The Incredible Hulk Edward Norton can now take his place in the superhero genre besides such contemporaries as Tobey Maguire, Robert Downey, Jr., and Ben Affleck all of whom have played comic book superheroes. It's the in thing to do in Hollywood these days and I have to say the films for the most part make money.When we meet Norton he's living in obscurity in Brazil trying to control his emotions because the experiment that turned him into the green guy have already gone horribly wrong. Norton is scientist Bruce Banner who made the mistake of experimenting on himself. Now if you get him mad it's not a pretty sight both to look at him and to see what he can do.General William Hurt wants him back at any price. His scientist daughter Liv Tyler wants Norton back as well. She's carrying a Statue of Liberty size torch for Norton who when he's in Hulk mode would use that torch as a matchstick.To track down the Hulk, William Hurt has imported a real bad dude from the British Royal Marines in Tim Roth. At some point Hurt decided he'd like a lot of what Norton has and of course the final confrontation is with them. I'm still not sure why we had to import him from the United Kingdom, but the match between them reminded me of Andre the Giant versus Big John Studd back in the glory days of the WWF.Though the cast looked like they were having a good time, I'm not sure The Incredible Hulk gets beyond the comic book stage. TV's famous Doctor Banner, Bill Bixby made a cameo appearance via a clip from another old series of his, The Courtship of Eddie's Father. And when the late Mr. Bixby was in Hulk mode he was Lou Ferrigno who plays a small bit as a security guard who can be bribed with pizza.If this film succeeds I'm sure there will be a sequel, in fact one was kind of set up during this film. Let's see if we get to explore that in the next Incredible Hulk film.",4,4,8,1 July 2008
The Monuments Men," The ornaments of civilization
","If one doubts the importance of those people called The Monuments Men in saving nothing less than the ornaments of civilization I would commend them to read some ancient history. What Adolph Hitler had was a two fold aim. A museum where he could house the stolen beauty of his conquered countries and view it for himself and his chosen elite. And to destroy the accomplishments of his conquered peoples so that only that what was deemed Nazi acceptable should survive. Remember what the Romans did to the civilization of Carthage. All we know about it is from the view of their conquerors. It's what Hitler ultimately intended.George Clooney gets a special commission from FDR after he sells the idea of a picked crew of art historians to go in and try to save as much as they could. All in all I'd say that Clooney and his team which consisted of Matt Damon, Bob Balaban, John Goodman, Dimitri Leonidas, Jean Dujardin, and Hugh Bonneville went into harm's way in their mission. They had to persuade our side to let them do their work and not interfere with the war. And the married Matt Damon manages to mix a little pleasure with business with Cate Blanchett who worked at the Louvre and told them what to look for and a general idea where to look. The Monuments Men is a wonderful film about a little known, but vital mission in World War II. Vital because these men and women were trying to preserve what our civilization is all about.",9,8,14,24 February 2014
Requiem for a Dream," No Future At All
","Requiem For A Dream is one of the most depressing films I've ever seen in my life. These poor people from two generations are a lot like Anthony Quinn in Requiem For A Heavyweight. As a boxer Quinn in that film saw his career at an end and faced a very unpromising future. These people have no future at all. I certainly recognized the Coney Island/Brighton Beach area of Brooklyn, an area of projects and an amusement area that has seen better days. Like Atlantic City, some in Coney Island eventually see casino gambling as the gimmick for a rebirth. If you see Requiem For A Dream, imagine it in that kind of Las Vegas type setting.At one time Brighton Beach was a template for a working class Jewish paradise of sort with families housed in apartments that partially built with the backing of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union. Back when I was doing senior citizens crime claims at New York State Crime Victims Board, I can't tell you the number of claims from men and women who listed a small ILGWU pension as part of their income from that area. Such a woman is Ellyn Burstyn playing Sara Goldfarb.Things haven't gone right for her. As the neighborhood decayed, so did her life and family. Her one son Jared Leto, a promising kid at one time is now a hopeless addict with an addict girlfriend in Jennifer Connelly and an addict best friend in Marlon Wayans.I've known a few junkies in my time also. After a while they only have one thing on their mind, their particular addiction of choice and how to service it. Even if they want to rise in the dope trade business, they haven't got a head for business any longer.Which in a nutshell is the position of Leto and Wayans with Connelly in support figuring her own habit can be taken care of by following their lead. Of course its disaster all around.As for Ellyn Burstyn she gained Requiem For A Dream's only Academy Award recognition with a nomination for Best Actress. She's not just clueless about her son, she's caught up in her own chemical dependency. She dreams of her 10 minutes of fame on some daytime quiz show and gets herself nicely hooked on diet pills. Unlike her son, she does have some memories of better days and talks about them with her peers on the benches outside the apartments.I recognized a lot of the Brighton Beach/Coney Island area of Brooklyn where this was all shot on location. Requiem For A Dream is a sad film about sad people, definitely one to bring you down from any kind of high you might be on.",8,4,7,5 May 2010
Captain Phillips," This is indeed Africa
","In the great Leonardo DiCaprio film Blood Diamond, the standard explanation for why the political situation is so screwed up in that continent wherever you go it was simply T I A, This is Africa. And one of the most screwed up places in that continent is Somalia which has not had an effective central government in years now. It's a country totally devolved now with a bunch of warlords, some with ties to Moslem supremacist groups, others have no ideology but profit. With no government to rein them in, some on the coast have discovered that piracy is an effective way of making money.So what starts out as two small skiffs with outboard motors and four men in each boat turns into one skiff with four armed men who get lucky and find a whole in the boat's defenses and board the USS Maersk Alabama, a freighter with a good cargo and commanded by Tom Hanks playing the real life Captain Richard Phillips who becomes a hostage of the pirates as they leave in one of the ship's lifeboats.After that it becomes a battle of wits between Hanks and pirate leader Barkhad Abdi and will the US Navy effect a rescue. This battle is at the heart of Captain Phillips. This man is mister average American, no superhero and doesn't claim to be. His responses to these volatile pirates are a matter of having his training kick in. What I did not understand is why a merchant freighter going into those waters was not armed. Certainly in World War II eventually they were armed. I wouldn't advocate arming our whole merchant fleet but when you're sailing in waters like off the Somali coast it would seem the prudent thing to do.Tom Hanks gives a wonderful performance leading a very well cast film showing sailors and pirates caught up in a bad situation.",8,12,25,16 October 2013
Sucker Punch," Another Trip To Willoughby
","Watching Sucker Punch put me in mind of a great old Twilight Zone episode A Stop At Willoughby. Young Emily Browning has been committed to an asylum where apparently all the patients are young and nubile women who are played by Vanessa Hudgens, Abbie Cornish, Jena Malone, and Jane Chang. There seems to be a good reason for that as these women have to dance alluring dances and perform other services for high rolling customers. A way for the asylum to make some money.Like James Daly in the Twilight Zone episode who was a modern businessman under great job pressure looking for an escape, these women want to escape as well. He found an exit in an unscheduled stop in a town called Willoughby which looks like a set from The Music Man. The girls also want an escape into life beyond the walls of this place they're trapped in.More I can't say lest I divulge the secret of the plot. But Browning and Daly both want out of the life they're trapped in and each finds a similar solution. Scott Glenn has a mysterious and unique role similar to the train conductor in the Twilight Zone episode.Sucker Punch because a lot of it takes place in the imagination has a great show of special effects virtuosity. If you're not terribly concerned about story and plot as I am, this is the film for you. The girls are lovely to look at also and they have great fighting skills or their stunt doubles do.",6,10,19,2 April 2011
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," They're Married
","Finally that dead/undead duo of Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart have finally tied the knot though Stewart's father is not ecstatic over her choice of life or after life partner if you will. Why couldn't his beautiful daughter marry a nice doctor?Pattinson and Stewart honeymoon in Rio DeJaniero and that's certainly one of the most romantic spots on the globe. And Stewart is in a family way. But giving birth to a vampire is difficult indeed and there are no vampire obstetricians apparently.Taylor Lautner as the Indian wolf prince of his tribe is still the odd man out in the triangle. Poor kid, personally I'd have taken him before Pattinson. The possible birth of the Pattinson/Stewart child is held as a threat to his people so Lautner has some critical choices to make. Do you doubt where he's going to come down?These two seem to be having a romantic triangle that rivals Arthur/Guinevere/Lancelot. But those who follow the Twilight novel series know what's coming up and it's not quite the same as Malory.Breaking Dawn Part I is the weakest so far of the Twilight films I've seen, but it does set the stage for what is to follow.",4,5,7,13 February 2012
3:10 to Yuma," How I Miss Frankie Laine
","It seems as though back in the fifties every other western seemed to have Frankie Laine singing the theme song. The 1957 version of 3:10 to Yuma is one of my favorite westerns. Part of the reason is that theme which echoed through out the film. What I liked about 3:10 to Yuma is that the hero/protagonist is an ordinary man trying to support his wife and two sons through some very hard times. When a killer is caught and because he needs the money he agrees to help transport him to Yuma State Prison on the 3:10 train from Contention. A lot happens between the capture and the boarding of that fateful train.Russell Crowe and Christian Bale make admirable updated substitutes for Glenn Ford and Van Heflin. Though Ford's performance as the sly rogue of a gunman is good, the previous film was driven by what I always considered Van Heflin's greatest screen role. The original holdup was hardly the violent affair that this one was. Only one shot was fired and that was by Ford when the shotgun guard momentarily overpowered one of the gang. That's here too, but the holdup itself was taken from The War Wagon.One part was totally eliminated and that was the part of the town drunk, played by Henry Jones in the original version, who was the only other man to volunteer his services. Jones was killed in a gut wrenching scene then, but in fact my favorite scene from the original was when Heflin's wife Leora Dana pleads with him to let Ford go, he responds with a heartfelt speech about how he couldn't look himself in the face after the sacrifice the town drunk made. I've seen the 1957 version dozens of times and am never failed to be moved by that scene.In its place the part of the oldest son is built up and conversely the wife's part is cut down. Young Logan Lerman plays the older son who tags along after the group taking Crowe to Contention. Lerman is 14 and he and Bale have the usual father/son issues. Lerman feels his Dad to be a failure with things going so wrong against them. Bale and he bond during the shared experience and you know no matter what the outcome of things, he'll leave a good legacy for his children.The usual tension between Bale and Crowe is present as it was in the original when Ford kept trying to bribe Heflin. Added to this is a whole lot of violence, most of it started by Ben Foster who's part as the young punk outlaw in the original was played by Richard Jaeckel. Foster is one murderous thug in this film, only Crowe is able to keep him somewhat in line. The characterization is still there, the violence is expected in this day and age even though a lot of it is gratuitous. This version of 3:10 to Yuma is fine, but it can never take the place of the original in my affections.This review is dedicated to young Harve Stewart of Stephenville, Texas and one of the Professional Bull Riders best young stars. I saw an interview with him where he mentions this is a film he likes. I liked it too, but I would commend him to watch the original 3:10 To Yuma which is just one of the best western dramas ever made. It was out in 1957 and I was 10 years old at the time. I'm old enough to be Harve's grandfather and I'm sure back in the day 3:10 To Yuma was enjoyed by his real grandparents in the theater.",8,8,17,7 September 2007
The Sound of Music," One of Our Favorite Things
","I was fortunate enough to see The Sound of Music on Broadway with the original cast minus Mary Martin, her part had been taken over by Martha Wright at that point. The production was good, but the thing I like best about The Sound of Music was how well Robert Wise transferred it to the screen. I defy anyone to show any trace of stage origin in this magnificently photographed film from that aerial opening with Julie Andrews singing the title song to the end with the Von Trapp family climbing every mountain.The main difference between the stage production and the screen version is that the role of the Baroness Elsa Schrader played by Eleanor Parker is a singing role. With the casting of Ms. Parker, a talented player but no singer, certain songs out of necessity had to be eliminated. Eleanor is fine in her role, but I do wonder if Robert Wise meant to cast a singer in her part originally. On Broadway the Baroness was played by Marion Marlowe.Julie Andrews who became a Broadway star in My Fair Lady and Camelot and didn't do either role for the screen, gives her greatest screen performance in a Broadway role originally written for someone else. There was some criticism that Mary Martin was too old to be playing Maria in the original play, but she certainly was guaranteed box office on Broadway. Julie Andrews was just right for the part and she's in great voice. I always marvelled listening to her at the perfect diction she was able to maintain hitting those high notes.Christopher Plummer took over the role that Theodore Bikel on Broadway and he too gained a signature role for his screen career. I've always felt that the talented Mr. Plummer has never been given the credit due him. He was a perfect Duke of Wellington in Waterloo and his portrayal of Commodus in The Fall of the Roman Empire is the highlight of that film. I like Christopher Plummer because he's also never taken himself seriously though he takes his art very seriously. I don't think too many other actors today could have played that comic villain in the Tom Hanks/Dan Ackroyd Dragnet movie and done it with such obvious zest and enjoyment.A real old timer got into this film with Peggy Wood playing the Mother Abbess at the Convent where Maria is a postulant. Ms. Wood's Broadway career dates back to 1911 and on stage she introduced songs by such people as Victor Herbert, Jerome Kern, Sigmund Romberg, and Noel Coward. You've got to be real good to get folks like that to write for you. And now her art is preserved in one of the most popular films of all time.The charm of the music and the leads and the kids sometimes obscures the anti-Nazi message that The Sound of Music conveys. The story takes place in Austria before and during the Anschluss. Christopher Plummer makes no secret of disgust for the Nazis and all they stand for. The Sound of Music makes it clear he is very much in a minority in terms of Austria uniting with Germany. Of course the irony is that Anschluss did not quite turn out for the Austrians as they hoped it would.The Sound of Music, it's story, it's music, it's lyrics and it's charm will stay with you and never leave after a hundred viewings.",10,17,36,20 November 2005
Catch Me If You Can," Nyah, Nyah, you can't catch me
","Catch Me If You Can should be seen back to back with Tony Curtis's performance in The Great Imposter. They are both excellent films and both deal with a protagonist who's a brilliant and charming fellow and a quick study who masquerades in many disguises.In The Great Imposter the whole story is told from Tony Curtis's point of view. And it's more lighthearted in its treatment of Ferdinand Waldo Demara than this is of Frank Abagnale, Jr. Curtis's father Gary Merrill only has a few minutes in the beginning of The Great Imposter, but enough to establish the relationship there. Leonardo DiCaprio and Christopher Walken as son and father have a great deal more screen time together.And of course in Catch Me If You Can we also have the point of view of the man trying to catch young Abegnale, FBI agent Tom Hanks. Remember this was the Sixties and J. Edgar Hoover was running the agency. Hanks is great as the uptight, buttondown agent in the Hoover mold. One of the best scenes in the film is DiCaprio conning Hanks out of an arrest by pretending to be a Secret Service Man and humiliating him in the process. He also turns Hanks into a man with a mission. DiCaprio is a middle class kid from Westchester County whose father suffers some business reversals like Gary Merrill did in The Great Imposter. He refuses to accept a change in lifestyle and because he's bright, he develops into a master check forger. He masquerades as an airline pilot, a lawyer, and a doctor and steals millions of dollars and lives high on the hog. Another scene I like is DiCaprio entertaining a high class model at a five star hotel and then we cut to Hanks doing his laundry at some cheap laundromat.Steven Spielberg allowed Walken to develop his father character a whole lot more than Gary Merrill did in The Great Imposter. This man for whom the American Dream became a nightmare got a deserved Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor.The Great Imposter with its accent on entertaining never allowed Tony Curtis to develop Demara's character as DiCaprio did with Abegnale. Basically DiCaprio finds it easy to con people because people do want to believe the best in you. Ironically he develops a telephone relationship with his pursuer in the same way Curtis had with his parish priest, Karl Malden. The reason is simple, Hanks is the only guy who knows what makes him tick. And in the end Hanks is the guy who provides a useful outlet for DiCaprio's talents.I like the way Spielberg developed his characters in this film. We get good three dimensional portrayals from DiCaprio, Hanks and Walken. It's a great film about another amazing adventure.",8,2,5,21 February 2006
The Hangover," A Baby In The Closet And A Tiger In The Loo
","The Hangover is a great example of what the former frat boys from Animal House do the rest of their lives. Just simply more of the same.I have no doubt that these four would have been members in good standing right along with Blutarsky, Otter, and the rest. Bradley Cooper, Zack Galifianakis, Ed Helms, and Justin Bartha decide on the way to Bartha's wedding in Los Angeles to have the ultimate in bachelor parties with a night in the sin city of the west, Las Vegas.It was one hell of a party, somebody slipped our merry men the date rape drug and they have absolutely no idea where they've been or what they've done. Worse than that they've got a baby in a closet and a tiger in the loo. But even worse than that, Bartha's been misplaced and they haven't the foggiest idea where to start looking for him.If you're taste runs to Animal House and Police Academy like comedies than The Hangover is definitely your cup of tea.",6,2,8,28 July 2009
Ghost," 'Godspeed Your Love To Me'
","If nothing else the popularity of the film Ghost guaranteed a revival of that great love song Unchained Melody. It's always a pleasure when good music is heard on the airways and we have Ghost to thank for this little treasure making a comeback.Ghost also provided Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore with a couple of career roles as a typical yuppie couple settling in Tribeca when tragedy strikes one of them. But as it turns out, that's only the beginning of the story.If you were to describe Ghost I guess the best way you could describe it would be a drama/fantasy with some humorous moments, mostly as a result of the casting of Whoopi Goldberg as a fake psychic. But she comes into the story in the middle of the film. Patrick and Demi, those brat pack alumni are now eager young urban professionals, Demi makes and sells her own pottery and Patrick works in a bank, in the high end area of one, he's not just a teller. When we meet them they are starting to fix up their Tribeca loft with one of Swayze's co-workers, Tony Goldwyn.But one fateful night after seeing a performance of MacBeth, Swayze is killed as a result of a street mugging. But was it just that, a simple robbery? Not by a longshot and Swayze who was killed before his time is angry enough to stay on Earth and find out what really happened.Of course he needs an ally and that's where Whoopi comes in. Turns out that there might be a little truth in her advertising as a spiritualist and consultant to the dead. Good enough for Whoopi to win an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, the other Oscar Ghost won was for original screenplay.But you won't forget Patrick and Demi as a pair of literal starcrossed lovers. You also know that the universal fates will reunite them because people who care for each other as much as they did aren't destined to stay apart.I do so love Unchained Melody. Introduced originally by blues singer Al Hibbler in the Fifties it got a revival a decade later by the Righteous Brothers. Tony Bennett also recorded a fine version and after his death a previously unreleased version of it was put out by Bing Crosby's estate. It's a perfect song for the theme for Swayze and Moore.One of the best love stories of the last decade of the last century, despite the tragedy that takes place, Ghost is one feel good motion picture.",8,8,9,8 December 2009
Iron Man 3," Iron man getting a bit rusty
","I have to admit that part of my problem with Iron Man 3 is the fact that a neighbor gave me a bad bootleg to review the film. The sound quality was terrible. Still I have to say that the Iron Man franchise seems to be getting a bit rusty.Robert Downey, Jr. is clearly enjoying playing Tony Stark and his super hero persona Iron Man to the hilt. If the money's right and the box office good, no doubt we'll see him again. As no doubt we will girl Friday Pepper Potts, known in the real world as Gwyneth Paltrow.The world of Howard Hughes like industrialist Tony Stark comes crashing around him as a new villain known as the Mandarin does a Pearl Harbor like attack on the home base and Downey barely escapes with his life. No superpowers for the moment, Downey has to resort to wit and wile to stay alive to rescue Paltrow and the President of the United States who looks nothing like Barack Obama.As for the acting Ben Kingsley is hamming it up to beat the band. His performance would win the hog contest at any county fair. But his role isn't exactly Gandhi here. Shades of Fu Manchu in his Mandarin performance.Iron Man 3 is strictly for those of all ages who like comic books.",4,8,16,27 June 2013
Raiders of the Lost Ark," The Ark Should Have Come With A Warning Label
","Raiders of the Lost Ark marked the debut of Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones, two fisted archaeologist with a mean bull whip. The film also reawakened a longing in the American public for some good old fashioned pulp fiction adventure even if it is done tongue slightly in cheek.Archeology certainly is a competitive business, but I think Indiana Jones takes it to an exponential level. He certainly has to when he's dealing with the up and coming German Reich. What they and Jones are after is high stakes indeed. Both have a lead on where the Ark of the Covenant might be buried. It was spirited away after the destruction of the second temple in Jerusalem, whereabouts unknown until the 1930s. As the Good Book tells us the Kingdom of Israel was undefeated as long as the Ark was ahead of them in battle. So even with the Nazis rather well known policy about Jews, they'd like to have this thing with whatever powers it has.It's a pretty delicate matter. If you remember a soldier of King David was struck down for just touching the Ark as it was about to fall. You can catch that in the Gregory Peck-Susan Hayward film, David and Bathsheba. It should definitely come with a warning label. Anyway, Ford ably assisted by Karen Allen, Denholm Elliott and John Rhys-Davies goes after it and has to battle the Nazis for possession. As for the Nazis, it's like that old adage of being careful what you wish for.Raiders of the Lost Ark was nominated for several Oscars and came away with a few in the 1982 ceremony for 1981's films. After almost thirty years it's still rollicking good entertainment.As for Karen Allen and Harrison Ford. Go see Indiana Jones chasing down that Crystal Skull in theaters now if you want to find out what happened with these two.",9,4,7,12 June 2008
Spartacus," The Eternal Cry For Freedom
","From what little I've read of this film it was lucky to have been made at all. Some very big talents had some very big egos and those egos clashed repeatedly. Original director Anthony Mann was replaced by Stanley Kubrick by Producer/Star Kirk Douglas among other clashes.But the result was all worth it. The stars all give top notch performances, but the mark of a really great film is the memorability of each individual in the ensemble. To give a few examples, Charles McGraw as the sadistic trainer at the gladiatorial school, John Dall as Sir Laurence Olivier's prot√©g√©, and John Ireland as Kirk Douglas's fellow gladiator trainee are all memorable in the brief roles they have.Kirk Douglas wisely opts for a straightforward interpretation of a hero in the title role of Spartacus. He's a BC everyman, born into a world which hadn't heard anything about human rights, he knows and feels he's not just cattle. Catch the alternating scenes of Douglas and Sir Laurence Olivier addressing the slave army and the Roman Army. Olivier with his years of Shakespearean training coming across as the tyrant to be, and Douglas in simple prose talking about the slaves fighting for their hopes and dreams. Very effective.The plot concerns a revolt at a gladiatorial school which mushrooms into a crisis for the Roman Empire. Political factions led by Olivier as Crassus and Charles Laughton as Gracchus seek to use the slave revolt to further their own ends. Laughton as always is a wonder. It's a bit of unusual casting for him because his parts are usually those of very tortured souls. His Gracchus is a sly rogue, but a decent man. One of my favorite movie lines of all time is delivered by him addressing the Roman Senate where he says he'll 'take a little republican corruption for a little republican freedom.' Another sly rogue in the film is Peter Ustinov who won the first of his two Oscars as Batiatus the owner of the gladiatorial school. Like so many others I'm sure in those days, he's just trying to come out on the winning side when doing so could be a life or death situation.Jean Simmons as Varinia, beloved of Spartacus, has the only woman's part of any substance. But when was Ms. Simmons bad in anything. One of the most underrated and under-appreciated actresses in the history of film.The lessons about man's desire for freedom and to control his own destiny are eternal and valid. And this film will be also.",10,125,162,6 March 2005
Stop-Loss," Read The Fine Print In Your Enlistment Contract
","As it is in the Iraq War as it has been since wars started once mankind figured out how to use hunting tools as weapons, the nature of the soldier is to fight. The military man doesn't question policy or the reasons why he's in a war, he just does the best he can and try to survive. Which is what Sergeant Ryan Phillippe, hometown hero from Brazos, Texas who's done his tour of duty and is given the horrible piece of news that he's been ordered for another tour of duty in Iraq. They call it Stop-Loss hence the title of the film.Phillippe's last action in Iraq involved a nasty urban fire fight where some good friends were killed. He just wants to go back to civilian life and kick back. But the army wants his combat experience.What to do. Probably if Phillippe came from some liberal blue state he'd find a lot more sympathy in his course of action. But he comes from that reddest of red states, Texas. It's a whole different mindset there and his very upbringing is telling him he's got to shoulder the burden of arms again.Stop-Loss is a good film from director/writer Kimberly Peirce who brought us Boys Don't Cry. Stop-Loss is not as powerful as Boys Don't Cry still it sends a powerful if conflicted message for the young people today who might just contemplate a military enlistment.Channing Tatum and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are also in the film as Phillippe's fellow soldiers who have differing attitudes towards the army and the Iraq War. Hard to know what is right in a situation like this. Where you're brought up and by who might be the reason you take one course of action as opposed to another.For what Phillippe does and the rest do, you have to go see Stop-Loss. And this review is dedicated to all of the men and women in arms for the United States of America who carry out our policy and put their bodies and lives on the line for us. If our leaders err and they do many times, no blame should attach to them. They are the most precious resource of the United States of America.",7,11,21,7 April 2008
Casablanca," .....it's still the same old story, a fight for love and glory, a case of do or die, the world will always welcome lovers, As Time Goes By.'
","It's one of the great Hollywood legends how George Raft helped make Humphrey Bogart a leading man by turning down in succession, High Sierra, The Maltese Falcon, and Casablanca. Maybe Raft showed some good sense in letting a better actor handle those roles. In any event we've got some proof in the case of Casablanca.Check out some time a film called Background to Danger that Warner Brothers did with George Raft that also featured Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet. Had Raft ever done Casablanca the film would have been a routine action/adventure story just like Background to Danger. Instead with Bogey we get that, but also one of the great love stories of the century. Humphrey Bogart set the standard for playing expatriate American soldiers of fortune in Casablanca. Right now he's between wars running Rick's Cafe Americain in Casablanca in Morocco, an area controlled for the moment by the Vicky French government. He's got his fingers in a whole lot of pies, but Bogey operates with his own code of ethics. He sticks his neck out for nobody.Nobody except the great love of his life Ingrid Bergman who left him mysteriously in Paris as he was fleeing the oncoming German occupation. She walks back into his life with a husband, Paul Henreid who is a well known anti-fascist leader.The rest of the film is a contest for Bogey's soul. Torn between his great love, his own anti-fascist beliefs, and certain practical necessities of operating a liquor and gaming establishment in a hostile environment. So many things combine to make Casablanca the great film it is. Ingrid Bergman's lovely incandescence melding and melting Bogey's cynical screen persona. The indelible characterizations of Peter Lorre, Sydney Greenstreet, Claude Rains, Conrad Veidt and the whole rest of a 100% perfectly cast film. And the revival of a great ballad which serves as Casablanca's theme song.I say revival because As Time Goes By was introduced in 1931 in the George White Scandals on Broadway by Rudy Vallee. He made a record of it which sold quite a few disks back then. But by the merest of coincidences there was a strike that lasted two years that just began around the time Casablanca came out. The Musicians Union struck against the record companies. With no new records being made RCA Victor re-released Vallee's record and it became a monster hit on revival.Also when Casablanca came out as if the White House had a personal interest in the film FDR and Churchill had the first of their wartime conferences in----Casablanca of all places. Jack Warner must have said a prayer for that to happen.There are so many classic scenes and lines from Casablanca you can write a comment just by listing them. But my favorite has always been when the Germans have taken over Rick's place and are singing some of their songs, Paul Henreid goes to orchestra leader and asks him to lead La Marsellaise. With a nod from Bogey, the orchestra plays, Henreid leads them and the rest of the non-Germans in the cafe join in. Over 60 years later, one still gets a thrill from that act of defiance.Bogart and Rains were nominated for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor. Any of the others could have been as well. As I said before Casablanca is perfectly cast right down to minor roles like Curt Bois as a pickpocket, John Qualen as a fellow resistance leader, and S.Z. Sakall as a waiter at Rick's. If there was an award for ensemble cast, Casablanca would have won it. As it was it did win for Best Picture of 1943 and best director for Michael Curtiz.Casablanca will be seen and loved by filmgoers for generations unto infinity, as time goes by.",10,126,156,8 March 2006
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," The Civil War was never taught like this
","If Bruce Catton or Shelby Foote were still alive those distinguished historians would never recognize the Civil War, especially for the root causes shown here. Black slaves aren't an institution in the South for agriculture, to pick cotton and tobacco. They are in bondage for a far more sinister purpose, as food for vampires who have taken control in the south.Their untiring foe is Abraham Lincoln who fights them not on the political battle front, but by night due to his training as a railsplitter, he's pretty handy with an axe. He's hated the vampires ever since childhood when one of them killed his mother Nancy Hanks Lincoln. And here you thought she died of some frontier fever malady.Benjamin Walker plays Lincoln and Dominic Cooper plays the mysterious Henry Sturgess who becomes his mentor. Lincoln should only have had the kind of moves Bruce Lee would have envied in his life. Who would have thought it, Abraham Lincoln: Action Hero.You have to see how the fate of the nation at the Battle of Gettysburg is decided. Not to be believed.Everyone looked like they were having a grand old time making this film. And of course it's all claptrap, but enjoyable claptrap at that.",6,1,2,22 June 2012
Minority Report," Interpretations
","It's the year 2054 and mankind through the good graces of pioneering criminologist Max Von Sydow we're about to abolish crime all together. Von Sydow employs three psychics, no doubt the three best in the world and while it looks life is a pretty dull thing for them, spending all that time in water the better to receive images they're doing yeoman service to mankind anticipating murders to come. Right at the beginning of the film we see them in action as police are dispatched to capture Arye Gross as he's about to murder his wife and her boy toy.But some disturbing images come in regarding police chief Tom Cruise murdering a man who he doesn't even know. Now Cruise is a Richard Kimble like fugitive and he hasn't done the terrible deed he's supposed to do. But one of the water bound psychics turns in a different interpretation of the images she sees. It's that Minority Report that Cruise is interested in so Samantha Morton is taken by Tom who wants very much to find out what's going so he can alter his destiny if possible.I won't say more other than destinies can be altered and images can be manipulated and wrongly interpreted by some malevolent forces at work.Cruise and Von Sydow and the rest of the cast turn in some fine performances for Steven Spielberg. And Spielberg's own vision of the future is fascinating. I did love those images of horses making a comeback as a method of transportation. I'm guessing that fossil fuels had polluted the planet enough and we wanted biodegradable waste once again.Science fiction is always interesting, even the worst future films offer us someone's vision of the future be Steven Spielberg or Ed Wood. Spielberg at least has the talent to bring it off.And maybe crime prevention taken to its ultimate is not such a good thing. Watch Minority Report and see how you feel.",7,2,2,23 May 2016
Lifeboat," Your Rescuer Or Your Captor
","When David O. Selznick got some loan out money from Darryl Zanuck for Alfred Hitchcock's services for two films (the second was never made), I'm sure Zanuck must have just loved Hitchcock when he told him that he wanted to make a film with just one set. Talk about cost cutting, anyway after a few failed scripts, Zanuck got American premier novelist John Steinbeck to write an original screenplay and since it was timely patriotic, Hitchcock did it.So for Hitchcock asking for a one set film, the movie going public got Lifeboat. A disparate group of passengers and crew are torpedoed in the mid-Atlantic and wind up together in a lifeboat. After their ship went down however, another ship in the convoy rammed in the U-Boat that sank them. The last one picked up on board is a German.The crew members include John Hodiak, William Bendix, Hume Cronyn and Canada Lee. Passengers are Mary Anderson, Heather Angel and a dead baby she clings to, and millionaire Henry Hull. And of course playing a Dorothy Thompson like correspondent is the great Tallulah Bankhead.Lifeboat is a wonderful film not just for the fact that Alfred Hitchcock succeeded in making a one set film that you are never conscious of while watching. But it's the only opportunity to see Tallulah at the height of her fame. She made a bunch of Hollywood features at the beginning of the sound era, but they flopped for the most part. So she went back to Broadway which loved her best and her season box seat at the Polo Grounds where she was the New York Giants most devoted fan. Lifeboat should have rejuvenated a movie career, but she apparently didn't care. Lifeboat even on its own is her best work on film, let alone in comparison to other films.The villain of Lifeboat is our German, Walter Slezak. He's a devious and cunning individual, he seems stronger and more fit than the other Lifeboat survivors and because of that and in spite of the fact he's hated, he gradually assumes charge. There's a reason for his actions and his fitness and when it's discovered, grave consequences erupt.Canada Lee, distinguished black actor from the stage, gets a role here that's far from Willie Best or Step N' Fetchit. My favorite scene in Lifeboat is when Hodiak who represents the left on the boat is trying to rouse the rest to just toss Walter Slezak to the sharks when he first arrives, asks Lee for his opinion as he's a member of the party. Lee replies simply he didn't realize he had any vote or say in the matter, a very trenchant observation about how blacks were disenfranchised in a quarter of the USA, some twenty years before the Voting Rights Act.The Lifeboat survivors are a cross section of the American people and this World War II allegory in microcosm is to show just why these Nazis are as evil as they are and why we have to resist. Even today more than sixty years after it was first made, Lifeboat is still a great cinematic achievement from Alfred Hitchcock.And it was made so cheaply which Darryl Zanuck ecstatic.",9,27,36,1 June 2007
Training Day," Street Justice Dispensed
","Ethan Hawke, bright eyed and innocent, reports to his training officer for his first day on the job in narcotics in the LAPD. He never could have fathomed just how much he would learn on that very first Training Day.His training officer is Denzel Washington, a thirteen year veteran on the police who's put in a few years in plainclothes in Narcotics. He certainly has the experience, but just what kind of experience and what he imparts to Hawke is the subject of Training Day.A film like Training Day will rise and fall with the performances of these two characters since one or the other and mostly both is on screen from the beginning. Fortunately both Washington and Hawke complement each other's performances like jigsaw puzzle fit.It is no accident that Denzel Washington won his second Oscar, his first as Best Actor. This performance is working on so many levels it's astonishing. Washington is at all times, charming, capable, corrupt, violent, street smart, and arrogant. What I liked most about it is how the various facets of this character are revealed bit by bit to the audience and to Hawke though not at the same time.As for Ethan Hawke it takes him to realize just exactly what he's dealing with in a training officer. Hawke was nominated himself as Best Supporting Actor, but lost to Jim Broadbent for Iris. Still it remains his career role so far.Corruption in the Los Angeles Police Department isn't exactly a new story. In fact one of the supporting players, Scott Glenn who plays a drug peddler and well, did another film about LAPD corruption in Extreme Justice. LA Confidential also dealt with this issue recently, another fine film.Denzel Washington is a great example in this film of the arrogance of power. He's a guy who dispenses more street justice than going through the traditional system. So with what happens to him here, he gets one of the best comeuppances ever seen on the big screen.And I won't say what it is, but you've got to see Training Day to find out.",9,55,68,19 April 2008
John Wick," And they call it puppy love
","Watching John Wick I was sure that this was a project offered first to Sylvester Stallone. Stallone was just the kind of guy to go to war with the Russian mob and win as Keanu Reeves does here.John Wick is a retired hit-man and walked away from the life of crime because of the love of a good woman. The good woman dies, but has a dog sent to Reeves as a remembrance. Actually I can sort of understand that. I recently acquired a cat from someone who was close to me and died unexpectedly. If I had Keanu's killing skills I might do what he does.But definitely this was a role that cried for Rambo as Keanu plows through the Russian mob. The son of the mob leader tries to rip off Keanu's car and beats him up in the process and kills the dog. That last remembrance of his wife puts him over the edge and then look out Russians.I did find it hard to wrap my mind around the concept of an organized crime safe house where Reeves takes up residence while he does his thing. An interesting part is played by Adrianne Palicki as a female hit woman who wants to show up the men in the profession by taking down the guy who was number one. Ditto for Willem Dafoe playing an old associate of Reeves in the murder business.Keanu's fans will enjoy this, action fans who like lots of blood and gore in their cinema will like it. Still Stallone would have pulled this off better.",5,4,19,30 December 2014
Chinatown," Jake Gittes, Right Up There With Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe
","In Chinatown, Jack Nicholson gets one of his best roles, definitely in the top five as Jake Gittes, a throwback private eye to the forties of Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe. Had Chinatown been made in the Forties Humphrey Bogart who played definitive versions of Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe would definitely have been cast in the role of Jake Gittes. Nicholson however is one worthy successor to Bogey.Very little action takes place in Chinatown in Los Angeles and only some peripheral characters are oriental. What Chinatown is here is a metaphor for a place you don't want to go and a culture and way of life you cannot penetrate or understand. Back when Gittes was a cop he was stationed in Chinatown and always felt alien there. He couldn't do his job because he didn't understand the people.Gittes goes back to Chinatown so to speak when he's hired by Diane Ladd to shadow her husband. It's the kind of peep job Nicholson is used to and he does. Later the husband turns up dead and it turns out Ladd was posing as the wife. The real wife Faye Dunaway shows up and threatens to sue him.Nicholson keeps on digging and he comes up with a juicy political scandal involving a scheme to defraud essentially the whole city of Los Angeles with their water supply. But he comes up with far more than that involving Faye Dunaway's personal life.The lead villain here is John Huston in probably his greatest role before the camera with only The Cardinal as a rival. Huston is Dunaway's father, a rich gazillionaire who can just about buy everything and everybody and usually does. But as it turns out he's far more malevolent than that, a truly terrifying evil soul.Faye Dunaway does a great job playing a woman carrying one huge burden on her soul. Look for good performances by Perry Lopez as the dogged police lieutenant trying to keep everyone happy and Diane Ladd as the hapless fake Dunaway.Chinatown is one timeless film and will be getting raves centuries from now.",10,4,7,6 December 2006
Rocketman," Legend of rock and roll
","I do think an appropriate end for this musical fantasy biography of Elton John would have been him singing Goodbye English Rose at the funeral of Princess
Diana. It's where the world really got acquainted, a considerable more audience
than who usually go to concerts ad buy his records/CDs. I think Elton John as a
performer was truly the voice of his country expressing their grief.Saying that I did enjoy the film with Taron Edgerton playing the legendary
rock performer. It was quite the transformation from this gay shy nerdy English
kid who was studying to be a classical pianist who decides rock and roll is a
better method of expression.We see him going through the usual problems celebrities have, the bigger the
celeb, the bigger the entourage and it's tough to separate those who knew you
when and those who are hanging on and around.The film interestingly enough I think Rocketman bears comparison to is the
musical biography Cole which starred Kevin Kline as Cole Porter. Different type and era of music portrayed. But the film is structured the same way in
the way the numbers are done.Fans of Elton John will not be disappointed.",7,2,4,2 September 2019
A Star Is Born," 4th incarnation
","And for its fourth incarnation unless you count What Price Hollywood, the story
of A Star Is Born is getting its fourth remake. Back in the 70s when it was made
for a third time by Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson the setting was changed from the motion picture industry to the music industry.It remains so in this film which stars Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper. Cooper is
a country/western singer who is starting the downside of his career and he
meets a young aspiring performer Lady Gaga who works in a hotel restaurant
and has just about given up her aspirations for a singing career. But when
Cooper and his entourage hear her she becomes a project for him.If you've seen any or all of the other A Star Is Borns than you'll know some of
the key scenes already. The plot follows the same path it did with the other
three versions.The beauty of this and the other films is that the story and the performances
in all of them are so good that even if you have seen the other versions the
film still grabs you. If you haven't seen other versions so much the better.Lady Gaga was hired as a singer primarily, but she does show enough acting
chops to warrant a nomination for Best Actress, matched by Cooper for Best
Actor and Sam Elliott as Cooper's manager for Best Supporting Actor. A Star
Is Born also was nominated for Best Picture and a flock of other nominations
as well. It won for the original song Shallow.I doubt this will be the last remake, but it will do well until another in the
next 10 to 40 years comes along.",7,1,2,13 July 2019
To Be or Not to Be," That Is The Question, Lubitsch Or Brooks?
","One of the very few people who would think to remake an Ernst Lubitsch picture would be Mel Brooks who satirized just about every genre there was in Hollywood. But I doubt that Jack Benny, Carole Lombard and Robert Stack would have lent themselves to the slapstick type film that Brooks turned To Be Or Not To Be into and Mel's version is very funny.When the film opens the biggest problem that Jack Benny has on his mind is who's this secret admirer who keeps sending flowers to his wife Carole Lombard every night while they're on stage. Although it's helped his Hamlet performance, the angst Benny is feeling about Lombard being faithful, pretty soon Benny, Lombard, Polish airman Robert Stack and the whole touring company that Benny heads are all caught up in the Nazi German invasion of Poland which inaugurates World War II.Stack joins the Polish squadron of the RAF and there's a nice little Polish colony as with other occupied nations during World War II. One of them is Stanley Ridges who does propaganda broadcasts for the BBC. And he gets to be good pals with the airmen. But after he leaves for Germany on a 'secret' mission it's discovered in reality he's a German agent and is going back to Germany with a list of exiled Poles so that the Nazis could retaliate against families. Stack goes back to Poland after Ridges.Where he meets up with Lombard and Benny and the rest their troupe and let's just say that their talents as actors are never more needed than in the series of performances they give the occupying Germans.Whether dealing with marital problems or Nazis breathing down their necks Lombard, Benny, and Stack have no shortage of wits about them. Carole and Jack are old hands at comedy, but Bob Stack showed a nice gift for it as well. Of course Ernst Lubitsch's type of comedy is a great deal more sophisticated than Mel Brooks. He also was making his film at a time when the USA wasn't in the war yet and the outcome for Poland and the rest of the world remained in doubt. Not to mention what was left of a liberal spirit in Germany where Lubitsch was an exile from.This was Carole Lombard's farewell performance. Completed in 1941 To Be Or Not To Be was released just in time for Pearl Harbor and it certainly beats a lot of hastily made propaganda films that came out to tap into the national anger. It also got the same kind of knocks The Great Dictator did in satirizing the authoritarianism of the Nazis. But both films have stood the test of time. And it's not as preachy as The Great Dictator, but Lubitsch gets his point across. As for Lombard she went on a war bond tour which ended abruptly in a plane crash outside Las Vegas. FDR from the White House proclaimed she was as much a war casualty as any GI at the front and there were few who would disagree.If your taste runs to an earthier form of comedy Mel Brooks will certainly satisfy you. But for those who value sophistication as embodied in that phrase the Lubitsch touch, this To Be Or Not To Be still pulls in the laughs.",8,12,32,28 January 2011
Erin Brockovich," A Pretty Woman Takes Down A Big Utility
","In all the years that Frank Capra gave his populist films, none of his heroes were women. Back then it was the traditional roles with the men doing the heavy lifting and the women in support as wives and mothers so the men could slay the dragons.Frank Capra might never have given us a populist heroine, but I think he would have loved Erin Brockovich as much as I did. Although Albert Finney is the lawyer who took on the power Pacific Gas&Electric for the residents of Hinkley, California, the legwork (and what a pair of legs) was done by Julia Roberts.The true story of former beauty queen Erin Brockovich is one of the best roles for a female player in the past ten years and Julia Roberts was so right for the part. Beauty is a start for this part, but Ms. Roberts is also a single mother raising three kids who literally browbeats her way into a job with a law firm headed by Albert Finney that lost a case where she was a plaintiff. People all her life, and probably the men she was involved with never took her seriously because of her beauty. As Roberts got deeper and deeper into the case involving toxic chromium poisoning from a plant in Hinkley, she felt a lot more self worth and very much empowered due to the good work she was involved in. As she explains to current boyfriend Aaron Eckhardt in my favorite scene in the film, when she goes to Hinkley on any her firm's business, it's not a beauty queen that the people there are seeing, but a savior of sorts.Roberts puts her heart and soul in both her work and as mother. Some of her best scenes are her domestic ones with her three kids. She's not without weaknesses, she does have a tendency to snap judgments and she's not the most diplomatic of people at times. But a good heart and a good work ethic cover a multitude of sins.Unlike so many Oscar winning films, Erin Brockovich got a March release in 2000 not a release late in the year to keep the film fresh in Academy voters minds. Obviously no one thought of this film as Oscar caliber. Yet word of mouth spread about the film and it got several nominations including Best Picture, Best Director for Steven Soderbergh, Best Supporting Actor for Albert Finney and others. And it was a winner for Julia Roberts for Best Actress of 2000. Erin Brockovich was one of my favorite films for the new century and I think it will please every one who sees it.",10,2,5,30 August 2007
Meet the Parents," Those meetings are an ordeal
","Robert DeNiro in one of his occasional forays into comedy is both funny and terrifying as the dad from hell who scares away all of his daughter Teri Polo's boyfriends and potential husbands in Meet The Parents. Those meetings are an ordeal especially when this man who was from the CIA and specializes in subtle and not so subtle interrogation techniques and has his house bugged in every which way.The latest boyfriend is Ben Stiller who has been living with Polo and now they want to make it official. The fact they're together without benefit of clergy is enough to disqualify him from the start so Polo says let's not mention it. The second is that Stiller is a male nurse and that's not quite manly enough for dad to see as a profession for a son-in-law.Observing it all and keeping mum is Mom, Blythe Danner. One wonders how she hooked up with DeNiro all those years.Stiller and DeNiro really have the comic timing down beautifully. For Stiller this is old hat for DeNiro this is a chance to show his versatility. Best scene is the whole sequence at the airport as Stiller has decided he's had enough. He learns as well all know is that there's no such thing as ex-CIA.Two sequels have been made from Meet The Parents and who knows there may be more. I hope so.",7,0,0,14 September 2016
Star Trek," Kirk And Spock In Their Salad Days
","Star Trek purists all over the universe are trashing this version of Star Trek and while I don't consider myself a purist as such, this one did not leave me yearning for more.This version has the classic characters that have become so identified with William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy played by young actors Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto. We see them as children, in the case of Kirk at the moment of his birth, and then growing up into top flight cadets at Starfleet Academy. But there's no hint of the camaraderie that we remember from the television series or the films. Young Kirk is a rebel and we don't know if he'll ever be any good. Far cry from the disciplined starship captain we know. Spock is pretty much the character we do remember, he is a younger version of Leonard Nimoy. The others are all there as younger versions of themselves. Now as we're going through the film, purists will spot the many flaws in the saga we've seen develop. But that is later explained when we know the true nature of the villain that the Enterprise is pursuing. That would be Eric Bana a time traveling Romulan who's got a doomsday weapon and he's going to wipe out a lot of history as we've learned it.He alters quite a bit of it so if new films are made and they are planned, the Trekkies will have to get used to a whole new dynamic. One change that was for the better, it was nice to see Zoe Saldana as a young Uhura get around and actually have a life beyond opening hailing frequencies.The science seems flawed and I suppose we'll have to wait to get into the Star Trek century before we can get a clue if what happens in this film could actually happen. But I do wish they'd given the new Kirk and Spock a better introductory story because now they're stuck in those parameters.",6,4,6,16 March 2011
Fury," Those last bitter days
","Fury has Brad Pitt starring as a battle hardened tank commander in those last days before VE Day. Russians to the east, Americans, British, Canadians and assorted other allies invading the Third Reich that was supposed to last for a thousand years. These were the last bitter days of the war when what was on the west were kids and die-hard S.S. troops.While the Russians were facing a desperate resistance from the German Army because Germans in general knew what to expect from the avenging Russian bear, the western front had everyone surrendering or trying to cut deals for themselves. Not so the S.S. troops, Hitler's elite. And those we kill.In those last days Pitt gets a new replacement, a clerk typist suddenly drafted into the tank corps. It was Logan Lerman's misfortune to miss the end of the war in Europe by only a few weeks. He has a really bad time of it with Pitt and his crew, but eventually gets into the savage spirit of impatience for these men who just want these people to surrender and get it over.In the end Pitt gets what could be a last stand mission, hold a vital checkpoint crossroads to prevent a Nazi counterattack.Pitt and his soldiers are not from Hollywood World War II era films. They are a savage crew. But heroism sometimes can just be a case of\ opportunity.There might be an Oscar in the offing for Pitt and Lerman. Both are incredibly good and incredibly dynamic. The battle special effects are first rate. It's one unvarnished view of World War 2's final days.",8,39,65,28 December 2014
Citizen Kane," An Expert On What People Will Think
","The problem with writing about a film like Citizen Kane is that with 809 previous comments on the boards here, there is little that hasn't been said already. The best you can do is not look at any others and express your own thoughts your own way.I've always felt the real reason that William Randolph Hearst so bitterly resented Orson Welles's masterpiece is that it got really too close to his own soul for him to be easy. Most folks who talk about Citizen Kane go for the obvious target, Welles's depiction of Marion Davies (Susan Alexander) as a no talent gold digger. In fact Welles himself in later years said he thought he was unfair to Davies then in Dorothy Comingore's performance. What Welles showed in Charles Foster Kane was the insincerity of his beliefs. The key line in Citizen Kane I've always thought was what Joseph Cotten said that his friend Charlie Kane had a lot of opinions, but didn't believe any of them. To this day serious biographers of Hearst still wonder exactly what he did believe when the day was done.Citizen Kane came up with a host of Oscar nominations, but only took home one award for original screenplay for Welles and Herman Mankiewicz. Original it certainly was in concept and execution.The role that was written by Welles and Mankiewicz and directed by Welles for Welles is one of the greatest roles ever written for any film actor. The technique of Citizen Kane is always discussed, the flashbacks told from many points of view for the audience to get a grasp of what the title character was all about. What's not discussed is Welles himself.What he does in fact is give several performances of the same man in one film. Welles reinterprets Kane five or six times depending on whose flashback we're seeing. He's a scared child being taken from his parents, he's a rich frat boy and incorrigible scamp as seen by George Couloris the J.P. Morgan like banker, he's an idealist and crusader as seen by his business manager Everette Sloane, a man with no core set of beliefs who will do anything to bend the public to approval by his closest and maybe his only real friend Joseph Cotten, a lonely man with a compulsion for real love by Dorothy Comingore, and as an aging tyrant by butler Paul Stewart. Welles makes every one of these Kanes come alive and each relates to the other.The names of all those I've mentioned in the cast before were from Welles's Mercury Theater Company, nearly all went on to substantial movie careers. Others from the cast who did are Ray Collins, Agnes Moorehead, Ruth Warrick, and Erskine Sanford. I don't think any other film comes close to introducing so many talented players to the screen.The film begins with the aged Kane's death and that single word 'Rosebud' which sends everyone scrambling to find out just what he had on his mind in his final moments on earth. Those searching never do find out, but you the audience does and the unveiling of Charles Foster Kane's inner soul is something once seen and never forgotten.",10,12,18,25 April 2007
Darkest Hour," 'We shall never surrender'
","Last year the film Dunkirk told the story of Great Britain's most anxious moments
from the point of view of various British soldiers, sailors, and civilians helping to
get the British Expeditionary Force off the beaches to fight another day. Had these people not done their job on those beaches Winston Churchill's moments 
here would either have never happened or would have been an empty gesture
of defiance. No doubt had the Wehrmacht successfully invaded and occupied
the United KIngdom, Winston Churchill would have been shot post haste by
the Nazi occupiers.But because the job was done at Dunkirk Winston Churchill got to do his. After the Nazi invasions of Denmark and Norway, Neville Chamberlain's wartime government was ready to go, but the only Tory that the Labour Party
would serve under was Winston Churchill who had been consigned to the
back benches for most of the 30s. Labour itself was tinged with pacifism early
on and Churchill was the one who had consistently warned of the danger's
Hitler's rearmed Germany posed.Nevertheless events made it a 'close run thing' as another British prime minister of another century described a crisis he faced. In Churchill's cabinet
were a number of potential appeasers and their choice for prime minister was
Chamberlain's former Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax played by Stephen Dillane. If the members of that cabinet had their way Halifax would have been
prime minister and would have sought a negotiated peace.Gary Oldman has Churchill down perfect with all the bulldog defiance that comes through in those old WW2 era newsreels I well remember. No one else
in Great Britain would have pursued the policies he did at that time. He gave
the British people the blood, toil, tears, and sweat he promised and Great Britain and its Commonwealth partners carried on alone until the following
year Hitler attacked the Soviet Union and the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor.
Oldman got a well deserved Best Actor Oscar.Best scene in the film is when the aristocratic Churchill goes into the London
Underground for a sampling of public opinion. Even with the memories of
the stalemate in the trenches of WW1 still in their memories as they are in the
various Cabinet members like Lord Halifax they don't want to give up. The next chapter of the saga is contained in the all star epic The Battle Of 
Britain which tells of the Royal Air Force beating back the German Luftwaffe
while the bombs rained on British cities.That's not to be missed either.",8,2,6,10 May 2018
The Rookie," The Big Show
","Dennis Quaid stars in this biographical film about Jim Morris, once a promising prospect originally in the Milwaukee Brewer system who had several chances with a few teams and never quite made the Big Show as they call the Major Leagues. Now he's settled down being a full time science teacher and part time baseball coach at his small town Texas high school with wife Rachel Griffiths and their kids.But through some mysterious alchemy the arm trouble that washed him out seems to have gone away. Quaid is back throwing the high heat of his high school days. And soon more than his team notices.The Rookie is a great film in the sense that it shows people that every now and then dreams do come true. After long years Jim Morris got his chance to pitch in the Major Leagues, the dream of everyone who draws a paycheck playing a kid's game. His record isn't much for the Tampa Bay Rays and Morris managed to get there because this was an expansion team in existence for only a couple of years. But he's in the baseball encyclopedia for all time to come. Kind of like Moonlight Graham, played in Field Of Dreams by Burt Lancaster who was up 'for a cup of coffee and a look/see for John McGraw'. The Rookie is a nice baseball film and big Kudos to Dennis Quaid and everyone else associated with bringing Jim Morris to the big screen as well as The Big Show.",7,1,1,25 March 2016
The Birth of a Nation," 'History Written With :Lightning'
","When Woodrow Wilson was shown The Birth Of A Nation at a special White House screening, the very first I might add for a motion picture, he said that the film was 'history written with lightning'. And Wilson, being southern born and bred despite being President of Princeton and Governor of New Jersey, was merely reflecting what had become the historical interpretation of that time by many.Though someone like Claude G. Bowers for example would never have glorified the Ku Klux Klan as David Wark Griffith did, his histories also that of C. Vann Woodward became accepted interpretations. The Klan was merely the most extreme response of a proud, but defeated people being brought to shame and degradation. Remember the original source for The Birth Of A Nation was the Thomas Dixon novel, The Clansman.This generation of film fans will recognize the framework of the Birth Of A Naton from the epic mini-series North and South. Like the more recent epic, The Birth Of A Nation is concerned with two families the northern Stonemans and the southern Camerons. As war clouds loom the Stonemans are visiting the Camerons on their plantation in South Carolina.There would be barely any controversy over The Birth Of A Nation had it ended with the Civil War closing. The battles scenes that D.W. Griffith filmed were the best ever up to that time. His use of the photographs of Matthew Brady from the time to create the illusion of watching a Civil War newsreel was striking. The scenes of Lillian Gish and Henry B. Walthall are tender and romantic as the representatives of the Stoneman and Cameron clans. And the sight of Henry B. Walthall sticking the standard of the Stars and Bars in the mouth of the Union cannon will still inspire.Head of the Stoneman clan is Ralph Lewis who is the 'Master of Congress' on the order of Thaddeus Stevens. Stevens did have a black mistress in real life as does Lewis. But when his mixed breed Lieutenant Governor whom he has gotten elected in South Carolina asks for the hand of Lillian Gish who he's been crushing out on, well let's say Lewis passes a Guess Who's Coming To Dinner moment.Lewis and Joseph Henabery who plays Abraham Lincoln disagree on policy whenever the Civil War concludes which was certainly the case with Lincoln and Stevens. When Lincoln is assassinated which is witnessed by Walthall and Gish, Lewis's character assumes more real power than the unelected president over Reconstruction. That point of view is seen from the later film Tennessee Johnson with Van Heflin as Johnson and Lionel Barrymore as Stevens. That film also takes the same position as Birth Of A Nation.The matter of interracial sex was a titillating and at the time repellent factor given the mores of the times. Gish with George Siegmann as the Lieutenant Governor was a strict taboo. It should be remembered at the time that Birth Of A Nation was out in first release, Jack Johnson the black heavyweight champion who had three of four wives who were white, was hip deep in the middle of his legal troubles and don't think Birth Of A Nation wasn't used to fan some flames against him.What really set audiences off was the innocent Mae Marsh younger sister of Walthall pursued to her death by the lascivious Walter Long playing a newly freed slave. The not so implied message her was that these people were taking the notion of freedom way too far. Marsh's death and Long's 'trial' and execution set in motion for the triumph of white supremacy, the natural order of things in the minds of Dixon and Griffith and even the current President of the United States.Yet as repulsive as the message is, Griffith gave us some compelling characters whom we never lose interest in throughout the more than three hour long film. D.W. Griffith set out to give the audience the biggest show the cinema had ever exhibited and he certainly did so. Griffith also made great use of music during the film, like John Ford later did in his movies he used period pieces and old songs from Europe to great affect.No matter what we think of the message The Birth Of A Nation has its place in the history of cinema. It was an unparalleled achievement in its time and the stories of the Stoneman and Cameron families still hold our interest today. In a sense Woodrow Wilson was right because for all the pioneering techniques it displayed and for all the controversy surrounding its message, The Birth Of A Nation remains history written with lightning.",10,3,10,9 November 2010
Inglourious Basterds," World War II In an Alternate Universe
","I take exception to the comment that one reviewer made saying that a film like Inglourious Basterds had not been made before. Not only was one made, but it was made during World War II. When Hitler, Dead Or Alive was shown I'm sure the same rousing cheers went up from the audience who really wanted World War II to end that way.Quentin Tarantino must have seen Hitler, Dead Or Alive and decided to do a big budget version of that B film propaganda flick from the Forties. In that one Ward Bond, Paul Fix,and Warren Hymer play three German speaking gangsters who take a contract out on Adolph Hitler from some public spirited citizen. They enlist in the army, but as soon as they can they desert grab a plane with a pilot and land in Germany and set about to perform their task. What Tarantino has given us is Hitler, Dead Or Alive with official sanction. Brad Pitt heads a group of GIs, the rest of them are Jewish so they'll have proper motivation for this job, Pitt's a good old boy from Tennessee. The purpose of their mission is to just kill Nazis, the higher up, the better. And they soon get a reputation that's come to the attention of the Fuehrer himself.This film is a throwback to those propaganda films that came out as morale boosters during World War II. Pitt and the rest of the cast look like they're having a great old time with this. Best performance is Christoph Waltz who plays an SS colonel who specialized in tracking down Jews who've escaped Hitler's final solution. He might just get an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor.As for the end, just relax and imagine this is World War II in an alternate Universe.",8,9,21,8 September 2009
Amistad," Freedom's Cry
","I can say that back when I was a lad going to school in the Fifties and Sixties in Brooklyn, New York USA, we never learned of such things as the Amistad revolt. For that matter we learned nothing of Denmark Vesey's or Nat Turner's slave revolt. We learned about the Civil War and what led up to it. But the plight of the slaves themselves, not a word.So when Steven Spielberg did this film about an incident known to serious historians, but not to the public at large, I say BRAVO to Mr. Spielberg. What has to be remembered here is that the while slavery was legal, the importation of slaves had been banned for quite some time by 1839. The Africans depicted here are forbidden to be slaves in the first place.It was hoped that when the Constitution got going in 1789 that slavery might die on its own accord. But unfortunately a guy named Eli Whitney invented the cotton gin which was a device for picking through the pesky seeds in the cotton fibers. That made cotton THE crop of the south and gave slavery a new lease on life. And as you see in Amistad anything that threatened the life of what the south was pleased to call it's 'peculiar institution' was a call to arms.Amistad gives us the portrait of two United States presidents. The current one in 1839 is Martin Van Buren who's probably best known for being the real founder of the Democratic party political machine. He succeeded Andrew Jackson on March 4, 1837 and promptly was greeted with a bank panic that led to a depression. His chances for re-election in 1840 were not looking good to start with and he was exceptionally vulnerable to southern pressure. Ironically enough his last bid for public office was in 1848 as the third party presidential candidate of the Free Soil anti-slavery party. Nigel Hawthorne captures Van Buren, a man who always played his cards close to the vest.A very different sort was John Quincy Adams our sixth president from 1825 to 1829. His presidency was probably the least successful time in his whole public career which starts as teenager during the American Revolution. He undertook a series of diplomatic assignments culminating with being Secretary of State under James Monroe from 1817 to 1825. Of course he was the son of our second president John Adams and like his father refused to do even the normal political things that could have gotten him re-elected. As an ex-President he was serving in the House of Representatives in 1839 one of only two whoever went back to Congress after their presidential term was up. By this time he was a passionate abolitionist and the pleading of the cause of the Amistad slaves was an opportunity and a challenge. Anthony Hopkins captures the man who was now called Old Man Eloquent down to his clipped New England speech.What happens briefly is that a cargo of Africans on a Spanish slaver revolted mid sea and killed all but two on board. Those two were preserved because the Africans didn't know anything of seamanship. The two remaining steered the ship Amistad to Long Island where the whole story is discovered. The Africans become a legal and political football all the way to the United States Supreme Court.Other performances to note are Morgan Freeman as black free man Theodore Joadson, Stellan Skarsgaard as abolitionist Lewis Tappan, Matthew McConaughey as attorney Roger Baldwin and most of all Djimon Hounsou as Cinque the leader of the African's revolt. Before his story is told the attorneys have to learn the language and Spielberg graphically portrays their struggle for communication. Hounsou's portrayal of a man in an alien world who's only desire is to go back where he came from will sear your very soul.Amistad is grand entertainment and a needed history lesson about man's need for and willingness to fight to be his own master.",10,88,113,15 February 2006
The Fan," It's Just A Game
","Although The Fan has a baseball setting with the late Candlestick Park in San Francisco, it's not a baseball story. It's the dual story of a fan obsessed with baseball and his favorite player and that same player and his performance anxiety living up to the huge amount of money the Giants are paying him.The title role is played by Robert DeNiro and a lot of his character is taken from what Michael Douglas had earlier did in Falling Down. DeNiro is the son of the founder of the company he works for, but dad having passed away long ago, the company is in different hands. DeNiro is not cutting it as a salesman of hunting knives (no pun intended) and he's having problems with his former wife Patty D'Arbanville-Quinn over visitation with his son.At the same time multi-million dollar acquisition Wesley Snipes is having problems living up to the hype and he's looking like a big old bust. Especially next to new Giant sensation Benicio DelToro who is carrying the team with what looks like a Most Valuable Player season. Snipes is only doing well on one front, his relationship with his young son.As his life falls apart DeNiro starts fixating on his favorite player and what he can do to help motivate him. After that this film gets truly bizarre. But DeNiro who probably has more disturbed characters under his creative belt than any other actor around today keeps it all real. He's matched by Wesley Snipes who plays a Barry Bonds like superstar who gets a good life lesson by the end of the film.In fact Snipes realizes it before the film ends. As he quite realistically says, it's just a game, it's not like we're out there discovering a cure for cancer. The problem is that there are too many out there, fans like DeNiro in sports and in show business who get way too caught up in it.Look also for nice performances by Ellen Barkin who has a sports phone-in show and John Leguizamo as Snipes's agent and the wisest guy he has around him.",8,19,24,29 November 2008
Iron Man 2," Vince McMahon Promoting Our Defense Industry
","Iron Man 2 brings Robert Downey, Jr. back as Tony Stark, billionaire playboy by day and Iron Man superhero by night. The film does something unusual for a superhero movie, the mask is stripped away and Iron Man's identity is confessed to and revealed. Now everybody wants a piece of Tony Stark.Starting with the Senate Armed Services Committee headed by Garry Shandling has him subpoenaed and ordered to turn over the technology that created Iron Man. As survival was the first goal of the creation that seems like not a good solution to Downey. Rival defense conglomerate head Sam Rockwell also wants in on the technology.In a plot that was lifted from the cult Fifties science fiction classic Red Planet Mars, Rockwell makes a deal with Russian Mickey Rourke to get the technology. Rourke's father apparently was working along the same lines as Downey's father and he feels the Iron Man concept was stolen by him. He and Rockwell make a Faustian bargain.In the meantime Downey just wants to get away from it all and even turns his company over to best girl pal Gwyneth Paltrow. Gwyneth who seems to be all legs in this film is really up in it trying to deal with business and Downey at the same time. Another woman who has some mean limbs herself is security expert Scarlett Johanssen who leaves a trail of broken males strewn in her path when she's on a mission.Of course the special effects are what the movie-going public is paying to see and I note that there is an IMAX version of Iron Man 2 out there which only seems right. If I can I should try to see it in that media.If I had a favorite in the cast I would say it was Rockwell. His rivalry with Downey is something to behold. I do love the way these two market their defense wares for the government. It was like they left the promotion to Vince McMahon. Is this the way of the future?Folks who love the superhero genre will love Iron Man 2. The rest of us are somewhat amused.",5,2,6,9 May 2010
Seven Years in Tibet," One Of The Most Unique Adventures Of The Twentieth Century
","Tibet has certainly fascinated people all over the world. The hidden land in the most forbidding place on the planet not at either pole. In its day Lost Horrizon made quite a bit of money for its author James Hilton. But the real story of Heinrich Harrer is better than anything a fictional author could have thought up.Brad Pitt is Harrer in Seven Years In Tibet and this has become my favorite film of his. Heinrich Harrer, a world famous mountain climber and Austrian national hero goes on an expedition in 1939 to conquer an unclimbed peak in the Himalayas. While he's doing his mountain climbing Germany of which Austria is now part of marches into Poland and World War II begins. Harrer and his party are interred as enemy aliens.In 1942 Harrer escaped and he and a friend played by David Thewlis make their way into Tibet. The rest of the film is the seven years he spent there, centered around the unique friendship he formed with the child ruler of Tibet, the Dalai Lama. This in fact is the same Dalai Lama who today is possibly the world's greatest and non-aligned apostle of the gospel of peace.Brad Pitt is never better in the film than he is with the three child actors who play the Dalai Lama at various stages of his life. The physical hardship that he and Thewlis endure just getting into Tibet is adventure enough. But the spiritual journey he undergoes in his time there makes this one of the most unique adventure stories of the last century.One thing I liked about Seven Years in Tibet is that no effort was made to cover up Harrer's Nazi background. In an alternate universe one can speculate on what might have happened to him had he actually had to serve in the army in World War II. His internment saved him from possibly being involved any number of atrocities. God, fate, some kind of higher power saved him for something wonderful. The cinematography is breathtaking, this film had an incredible number of locations. Note that it was shot in British Columbia, in Argentina with the Andes serving as the Himalayas, Austria and even some establishing footage was shot in Tibet itself on the sly.Tibet's status is unique unto the world. It has been part of China since the Ming dynasty. It's referred to properly as the autonomous region of Tibet. China has given it autonomy in varying degrees over the past several centuries, it's never been truly independent. The Communist regime back in the days of Mao Tse-tung brutally asserted it's sovereignty a few times, most notably in late fifties when the Dalai Lama was forced to flee Tibet and live in Northern India where he resides to this day. That is when he's not traveling the world as it's foremost advocate of non-violence.It is sad that this film did not get more box office than it did. Brad Pitt, David Thewlis, director Jean Jacques Arnaud are all persona non grata in the People's Republic of China for making this film. Quite a market indeed to be shut out of for a stand for humanity.It's to be hoped that one day the Tibetans will be free. Until then they have their unique brand of Buddhism to sustain them and this wonderful film to tell their story.",9,27,35,6 March 2007
Mississippi Burning," It helps to be wise in the ways and mores of Dixie
","It's now a well documented fact that FBI director J. Edgar Hoover was convinced that the Civil Rights movement was somehow being directed from Moscow as part of the Communist conspiracy. As if anyone's struggle for equality needed outside direction. Hoover's bugging of Martin Luther King is legendary both for its lack of useful information to prove that thesis and for the titillation that King's indiscretions provided for certain people in power courtesy of J. Edgar.But when the murders of those two outside civil rights workers from New York City Michael Schwerner and Andrew Goodman happened the nation was shocked. First it was a missing persons case, then a homicide when the bodies were discovered. Public opinion forced the FBI and its director to take this seriously. And I have to say that when they did, the job was done.The names of the civil rights workers were not mentioned nor was the name of the young black kid who here was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. In real life James Morton was a voter registrar working with Goodman and Schwerner. That gave some dramatic license to the producers of Mississippi Burning to spin their own version of events. Given the redneck wall of silence that federal investigators had to deal with I'm not sure the spinning was too far from the truth.Willem Dafoe's portrayal of a button down FBI agent of the Hoover era rings real true. Hoover's own standards regarding appearance and behavior of his agents somewhat hampered law enforcement in certain fields. He had other foibles that have come down to us since his death in 1972, some real, some speculative. Dafoe just isn't getting the job done.Which brings us to Gene Hackman who is a former Mississippi sheriff and wise in the ways and mores of Dixie. When Dafoe gives him a free hand Hackman gets results even though like in real life these Ku Klux Klansmen could only be tried in federal court as no Mississippi state jury would have convicted these creatures. Hackman got a well deserved Oscar nomination for his performance. And it's a good thing that the ACLU wasn't looking to hard at Hackman's methods. It was like what Sean Connery taught Kevin Costner about bringing down Al Capone in The Untouchables. It probably did take the FBI bending Hoover's precious rules to get justice in real life. Frances McDormand plays a truly sad role as the wife of one of the sheriff's deputies who was in on the killing. She's a caring and compassionate woman and indiscreet about her husband's activities. She pays for that. It is restrained, understated, but very powerful performance that netted her a Best Supporting Actress nomination.Mississippi Burning won for Best Cinematography and got a number of other nominations including Best Picture. Sad to say it was up against Rain Man that year and I'd hate to split the difference between what Hackman and what Dustin Hoffman did in his classic.It's ironic that I saw this film and between seeing it and writing about it I attended one of many marriage equality rallies throughout the nation as the Supreme Court hears arguments about same sex marriage. The same people who could not comprehend the mixing of races are in the forefront of a fight against marriage equality because their minds can't comprehend that either. A seismic cultural shift against racial segregation took place just as a seismic cultural shift is occurring now toward the acceptance of the LGBT lives and lifestyles. It's been a privilege to live in these interesting times.Mississippi Burning with a bit of literary license remains a fine dramatic film and should be required viewing for those who want to study those times and get an idea what the civil rights struggle was about. Books will not give you as good an idea as Mississippi Burning will.",9,3,5,26 March 2013
42," It Happened In Brooklyn
","I was born on September 26, 1947 and at that time when I made my earthly debut in Brooklyn, the Dodgers had clinched the National League pennant that year. Just about the time that Branch Rickey's great experiment was concluded and America's national pastime was integrated. I grew up with the Brooklyn Dodgers and well remember how in 1958 they and the New York Giants moved to the West Coast. Jackie Robinson had retired at the end of the 1956 season so forever he was a Brooklyn Dodger.The story behind 42 needs to be told to a new generation to appreciate what we in Brooklyn lived during those years. Jackie, Gil Hodges, Roy Campanella, Don Newcombe, Duke Snider, Carl Furillo, Pee Wee Reese, these were the best and some of the best players at their positions during their careers. Because Branch Rickey stepped up to the plate so to speak and led in the integration of baseball, the Brooklyn Dodgers dominated their league for the ten years after the breakthrough year of 1947. And the other teams that won pennants in those years the Braves and Giants were those that closely followed the Dodgers in signing that untapped pool of talent that were in the Negro Leagues.Many years ago Denzel Washington played Jackie Robinson in a made for television film about his bad experiences in the US Army before all the action in this film took place. Denzel would have been perfect for this film had he been younger. However the relatively unknown Chadwick Boseman is both suggestive of Denzel Washington and truly steps into the character of Jackie Robinson who bore a lot more of a burden than the normal angst of a team sport athlete trying to see if he has the right stuff to play at the highest level of his chosen sport. One thing I was glad to see in 42 was the emphasis on Rachel Robinson's character and her support of her husband. When Branch Rickey was looking for the right black athlete to be the great experiment he placed a great emphasis on character. A couple guys did not get to be the first because they led some playboy lives. Rickey worried and rightly so that those opposed to what he was doing wouldn't hesitate to dig up any kind of personal dirt on whomever he chose. Robinson was a deeply religious man and the story he and the former Rachel Isum is one of the great love stories of the last century. Nicole Beharie plays Rachel and by all accounts she also captured the character of the woman who is still alive and has made sure that his memory and achievements are not forgotten. 42 earns its highest commendation from me for making sure that Rachel is not relegated to the sidelines.You will look in vain for a trace of Indiana Jones in Harrison Ford's portrayal of Branch Rickey. With a little bit of makeup Ford also becomes the character whom some called the Mahatma of baseball after another guy who was freeing his people. Rickey whose other major achievement in the sport was developing the farm system was as you see Ford on the screen. A man who was a Methodist lay minister he and Robinson bonded over the religious faith they shared. Rickey left Brooklyn in 1950 after a front office power play forced him out and gave control of the Dodgers to Walter O'Malley who was the one who moved them to Los Angeles after the 1957 season. Rickey signed on with Pittsburgh as their general manager and integrated a rather lack luster outfit. His work would start to bear fruit in the late Fifties after he had left the Pirates.42, Robinson's uniform number was retired in all of baseball some years ago in tribute from one generation to a pioneer who made it possible for people like Willie Mays, Hank Aaron, Frank Robinson, Ernie Banks to enjoy the star careers they had in my childhood. We who grew up in Brooklyn and idolized the Dodgers are also custodians of a legacy as well. 42 is a film that should be seen and seen again by those who want to know what the post World War II civil rights struggle was all about.And remember, it all happened in Brooklyn.",9,2,2,21 April 2013
Argo," Hollywood Hyperbole
","Ben Affleck who originally got acclaim for his collaboration with best bud Matt Damon on Good Will Hunting, went out gloriously alone and came back with a Best Picture Oscar for Argo, the story of one of the greatest hoaxes ever perpetrated in the last century or even in the short time this century has been around. I'm sure Matt Damon would love to have had a piece of this one.Based on writings of CIA operative Tony Mendez who engineered the escape of six American diplomats who were lucky enough to get out of Iran during the Ayatollah Khomeini craziness during the Iran hostage crisis, Affleck who sports a heavy beard that makes him totally unrecognizable as Affleck, but no doubt Mendez had such a growth. Only the voice lets you know from time to time that it is Affleck.Our protagonist has a history of pulling off good intelligence coups and he's given an assignment by his superiors. When they learn that the American diplomats are hiding at the Canadian ambassador's home he has to devise a scheme to get them out. He's one of several people put on this problem. His solution is to appeal to the Iranian's sense of celebrity. Affleck creates the cover story of a movie being shot in Iran, a science fiction spectacular like Star Wars and these folks were there scouting locations in the desert. Hollywood contacts John Goodman and Alan Arkin were most helpful, their sense of Hollywood hyperbole comes in handy. In fact both make several jokes about the movie capital. Arkin got a Best Supporting Actor nomination.Of course we know what happened. I remember the news breaking that the Canadians had gotten these diplomats out who should have been hostages along with the others. The Iranians huffed and puffed and vowed divine retribution on Canada for aiding the Great Satan. It all came to naught however.Argo which is the title of the pretend science fiction epic so far represents the summit of Ben Affleck's career. Why he did not get nominated for Best Actor and Director is quite beyond me if the Academy thought the film that good. Now that the story is declassified we now see that the CIA can occasionally get it right.",8,2,3,27 March 2013
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Channeling Robert Newton
","This first of the Pirates Of The Caribbean series, Curse Of The Black Pearl was a milestone in the career of star Johnny Depp. I always liked Depp since 21 Jump Street and he always chose quirky products where he did great as an actor, but the films were more often than not less than successful commercially. With this film first and foremost Depp got himself linked to a commercial success that spawned several sequels. His box office was now secure.But also this is a once in a lifetime chance to do a part that calls for some of the most outrageous overacting you'll ever see. I think Johnny Depp might have been channeling Robert Newton in one of his pirate films, be it Blackbeard or Treasure Island.In fact the plot is a lot like Treasure Island in the sense that Depp is looking to get back his ship the Black Pearl. It was taken over by his former First Mate Barboso played by Geoffrey Rush and the whole crew Depp included is under a really bad curse. A couple of civilians, governor's daughter Keira Knightley and blacksmith Orlando Bloom are also part of the adventure.The Pirates Of The Caribbean blends both the swashbuckling adventure film and the horror genre quite nicely. I can certainly Robert Newton in the part had this been 60-70 years ago. This is one film as are the rest in the series to just kick back and enjoy.",7,0,0,27 June 2017
Star Trek Into Darkness," Khan has returned
","Zachary Quinto as Mr. Spock shows more emotion in Star Trek Into Darkness than Leonard Nimoy did during the entire run of the series and the various big screen incarnations. Considering the stress that he and Chris Pine as Captain Kirk are under in this one it is understandable.It's hard to tell who the enemy is in this one. We've got a Star Fleet Admiral played by Peter Weller who is sending the Enterprise on one dangerous mission and it seems more and more like its real purpose was to provoke the Klingons into an all out war.Their mission was to essentially assassinate a man named John Harrison who has defected to the Klingon Empire. But the last time such an assassination was ordered it was for either Admiral Yamamoto and for Osama Bin Laden. And the people carrying those missions out did not have the weaponry of the Enterprise.Instead Kirk takes Harrison alive which fouls up the plans of a lot of people. And Harrison whose real name is Khan and is played by Benedict Cumberbatch has really got an agenda all his own.By the name you'll recognize this as kind of a remake of the classic Star Trek, The Wrath Of Khan. But if you think you know then as a good Trekkie what's coming then you're in for a surprise. Important variations are made to the plot.The high standard of good science fiction and characters of idealism and fortitude that all the incarnations of the Enterprise have shown are faithfully retained here. This is truly the next generation of Star Trek.",7,1,3,24 June 2013
Stripes," It Can Stand Up To Goofballs.
","Despite the fact that there is no way on God's green earth or this country's army that such a set of circumstances could ever happen, that's still no reason not to enjoy Stripes. The film is in a long line of service comedies that date all the way back to Charlie Chaplin's Shoulder Arms and further than that. Even Shakespeare found some humor in army life, just read how Falstaff made do in the service of his king.Of course Falstaff wasn't a drill sergeant like Warren Oates who had a platoon of underachievers with the likes of Bill Murray, Harold Ramis, and John Candy as recruits. As is usual the service comedies make a mistake in that the basic training company stays intact with the same sergeant. In real life Oates would have taken a drink when the eight weeks was done and gone on to some fresh young trainees.But some brain in the Pentagon decides that what a new type urban assault vehicle needs is some fresh recruits to maintain it, reasoning if the vehicle is worthy it can stand up to goofballs. The vehicle looks like your ordinary average camper, in fact Murray and Ramis while they're guarding it decide it would be a great chick magnet. So they pick up a pair of female MPs in P.J. Soles and Sean Young. The officer in charge is John Larroquette who isn't much better than the recruits he has and when the vehicle turns up missing, he sounds the general alarm worthy of the Captain in Mister Roberts. He leads the whole troop after Murray and Ramis right into at that time Communist Czechoslovakia and some nasty Russians. Good thing they didn't have their A team playing either.Stripes is your typical armed service comedy with a nice Eighties twist from Bill Murray and a crew from Saturday Night Live just coming into their prime as players. John Larroquette is the best in the film, imagine ADA Dan Fielding in an army uniform and you got Larroquette's character. You notice the New York County DA's office never gives Fielding any really big cases to handle.And yes that vehicle can withstand anything and it has more tricks than James Bond's Astin-Martin. To see what and how much, you have to watch Stripes.",6,16,21,15 December 2009
12 Angry Men," A Very Flawed classic
","When I was younger I thought 12 Angry Men was a near perfect ensemble film with a great group of male players. At that time in those sexist fifties women had an automatic out from jury duty. It was not unusual to have all male juries as we have here.Then I served on a few juries and my concepts changed. One of the key scenes of the film is when Henry Fonda produces a switchblade knife exactly like the weapon the young perpetrator allegedly used in the stabbing death of his father. The second that Fonda produced that knife, someone should have yelled for a mistrial.In all 50 states of the United States of America, a standard jury instruction is that the jury is to decide the guilt or innocence of a defendent on the evidence presented at trial. Jurors are free to come and go until they are sequestered for the verdict. But they are instructed not to go near the crime scene or gather ANY independent evidence. I remember being on jury duty and assigned on a case where the crime took place in an apartment that was one block away from one of two routes to a BMT subway stop that took me to work. And those same subways also took me to downtown Brooklyn and the court house. I made it a point to take the IRT to court for the next two weeks while the trial went on to avoid the temptation of going over to the crime scene.It was a great dramatic effect, but totally at odds with our legal system. I can't believe that something that elementary was left in a film that was purported to be a realistic look at jury deliberations.The juries I was on did debate and in some cases quibble over all the points of the trial. They were a good cross section of the breed Brooklynus Americanus just as in 12 Angry Men. If you watch Law and Order you know how hard the prosecutors job is to get 12 people to convict.Still it's a wonderful group of players that participated here. Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb are the biggest names in the cast. But others like Robert Webber, John Fiedler, Martin Balsam, and Jack Klugman got their first real notice in this film.Jack Klugman's portrayal was a particular favorite of mine among the group. He's from the same slum background as the defendent and some of the knowledge he has from that environment makes for the most compelling argument for the defendent's innocence. We should be thankful that Sidney Lumet assembled and directed the find cast he did.",6,66,140,3 September 2005
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Children's Escapist Fare
","There's one good rule about the writing of children's stories, that you should never treat children like children. I believe that is the reason for the success of C.S. Lewis's The Chronicles of Narnia down through the years. And it's the reason for the success of this film, sure to take home some Oscar gold this year for special effects if nothing else.Before writing this review I did a little research on C.S. Lewis. I found that he had started writing this first story of the Narnia Chronicles during World War II. Lots of British families did like the Pevensies, ship their kids to the country side to escape the bombing of cities. They sent them abroad if they could afford to. What Lewis did was bring his Christian background and a vivid imagination in creating an escapist world for four kids who were in an unfamiliar area in the first place. These kids faced the real prospect of losing one or more parents and siblings. Enough of them did.Like American kids grow up on cowboys and Indians, British kids grow up on Knights of the Round Table and Robin Hood. Add some animals who all have the souls of humans, some mythical creatures, a wicked witch, and the King of Beasts and put these four Pevensie kids through a magic door and you've got Narnia.By the way I don't think it's an accident that Aslan, the Christ figure in the film is a lion. Remember the British national symbol is also a lion. Lewis didn't have the saviour of the kingdom be a Russian bear or an American bald eagle.I'm also sure that the success of the first book had a lot to do with the fact that it was published in 1950 at the height of the Cold War which a lot of people thought could get hot any minute. Parents wanted escapist stuff for their kids and for themselves as well. I'll bet reading all The Chronicles of Narnia was a secret pleasure.I think this film will be a guilty pleasure for a lot of folks.",10,7,11,7 January 2006

The Notebook," Noah And Allie Bridging The Years
","James Garner and Gena Rowlands and Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdam pay the same pair of lovers during the World War II years and up to the present day. All four of them and the cast assembled by director Nick Cassavetes present a wonderful romantic film that will bridge the generations.We meet Noah and Allie in their old age at first. We see their story later unfold, but we learn that while they may have lived happily it was not ever after as old phrase goes. Old age is a time of memories and if you're lucky enough to find your soulmate they will be shared memories. And that's half the enjoyment of memories, someone to remember the shared experience with.But when one of the partners develops Alzheimer's it's devastating for the one who doesn't have it to watch the other deteriorate. And that's what's happening with Garner as he visits Rowlands in a nursing home.On this visit he's prepared though. Garner has brought a notebook in which he's written down their story. The nurse introduces him as a stranger who takes her outside and proceeds to read their story as though this happened to two other people in an attempt to reach Rowlands.And in flashback we see their story and as Gosling and McAdams we see the ups and downs of a poor boy/rich girl romance. That makes up the bulk of the film. Gosling and McAdams are most definitely each other's soulmates, but her parents do their best to keep them apart and both get involved with other people, Jamie Anne Allman and James Marsden.The sad message is that even for the most right of couples, there's no such thing as happily FOREVER after at least on this Earth. I've had several two aunts with Alzheimer's disease and I could relate to what Garner was going through with Rowlands. And I have aunt right now who is 89 and in my last conversation with her I could see her memory going and how that must be affecting my uncle who is the same age.The four leads and the rest of the cast are just perfect in their parts. Director Nick Cassavetes is of course directing his mother here and you know they were completely in sync. I cannot believe The Notebook got no Oscar nominations at all, it's a travesty how it was overlooked by the Academy. It did get several awards and nominations from other venues, but not from the Academy.The Notebook is a perfect romantic story and the nature of it will appeal to all the generations we have living on the planet.",10,2,5,15 August 2008
The Rocker," Life and rock and roll
","The Rocker is a hugely enjoyable comedy about a man who gets a second chance
at life and rock and roll. For Ranin Wilson those terms are interchangeable.Back in the 80s the rising band Versuvius was told they had to chuck their drummer in order to get a big break. Wilson got the heave ho much the same
way Peter Best got it when Ringo Starr replaced him as drummer for the Beatles.
Best became the answer to a much asked trivia question and we know what happened to those guys from Liverpool and their new drummer.Flash forward to the new century and these kids who do their music thing in
the garage lose their drummer. Josh Gad remembers that back in the day his
uncle Ranin Wilson was a drummer so Wilson joins Gad and his band mates 
Emma Stone and Teddy Geiger and becomes part of their band.It's quite a rocky road and the band's first gig at the high school prom ends in
disaster. But Wilson starts fitting in with the kids and the mixed generation
band starts drawing real attention.Wilson is totally outrageous in a part that must have been offered to Robin
Williams, just the kind of material Williams used to specialize in. Christina
Applegate also appears as Geiger's mom who has a rock and roll background
of her own just might be a permanent romance once Wilson realizes that she
is a mom first.The climax at the Rock And Roll Hall of Fame where this band originates from
is nicely staged. Wilson with some angst gets to meet the guys that dumped
him. What happens to them is positively poetical.The Rocker is a film for those who want to be young forever. Some really do
make it like that. For the future Mick Jaggers of the world.",6,1,1,12 August 2018
Public Enemies," Dillinger And Purvis
","When The Petrified Forest was on stage and later on the screen, there was no doubt that Duke Mantee for the movie going public was based on John Dillinger. This bold and lawless man captured the imagination of the Depression era like none other, especially in that bold and lawless time. Banks and those that ran them were not the most admired folks of the time, many a person's life savings went down the drain in bank failures. A lot of the public saw Dillinger and his kind as just giving a little vicarious payback.What Public Enemies does do very well is show how J. Edgar Hoover used the tales of these people to publicize and modernize his Federal Bureau Of Investigation. That they put these folks out of business is beyond question. Billy Crudup as Hoover and Christian Bale as Melvin Purvis show the difference between the straight arrow G-Men of popular fiction that Hoover had popularized and the very real ruthless men looking to put the outlaws out of business.In the career of Johnny Depp I count five real life characters he's brought to the screen, Lord Rochester, Ed Wood, James M. Barrie, Joseph Pistone, and now John Dillinger. Depp seems to be making a movie to surpass Charlton Heston for portraying the most real life people. Of course this is far more eclectic list than Heston ever considered. Everyone of them different and yet all bear the stamp of Johnny Depp's persona in them. It's what I've always liked about Depp, he likes challenges and he meets those challenges.I can't say too much for historical accuracy here. John Dillinger met his fate before Pretty Boy Floyd and Babyface Nelson. And Melvin Purvis was not in on the killing of Nelson at all.Still the era is nicely captured by director Michael Mann. We might see an Oscar nomination or two for the technical awards and maybe for acting for Johnny Depp. Maybe he'll win this time.",7,2,4,7 July 2009
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Souped Up Sabu
","There was a time back in the day when Hollywood turned out dozens of films like Prince Of Persia. Universal Studios was the chief maker of these ancient Middle East fantasies. Maria Montez had a set built for her films and when she died it was used lots of times by stars like Rock Hudson and Tony Curtis in their early days. And of course the boy from India, Sabu kept his career going on films like Prince Of Persia.Now if you're expecting to see something remotely realistic about the Persian Empire which Alexander the Great put out of business, don't look at this film. Based on a video game, Prince Of Persia has about as much realism as an old Sabu movie. But that doesn't mean it isn't fun.Jake Gyllenhaal plays the adopted son of the King Of Persia Ronald Pickup who as a lad is taken into the royal family and becomes like another brother to his two natural sons. There is a brother of Pickup played by Ben Kingsley who is a chief adviser to the throne. All seems like a happy family.But Kingsley's got Richard III like ambitions and Shakespeare immortal crook backed child murderer has got nothing on Kingsley. He gets the sons to invade a Holy and peaceful city run by Princess Gemma Arterton on the pretext this crowd is plotting with folks who want to overthrow the Empire. However Kingsley wants to get at an artifact which in his hands can make him the master of time.I think with all the computer graphic generated effects which are considerable and nice, still don't make this that much more than one of those Arabian Nights fantasies that Universal used to specialize in. Sabu, Rock Hudson, and Tony Curtis, and Maria Montez were never in a film with a budget like Prince Of Persia.So with a plot based partially on Richard III and a bit taken from the Biblical account of the flood, Prince Of Persia will give you a couple of hours of good old fashioned film entertainment.",7,9,15,29 May 2010
Ted," Me And My Teddy Bear, we got no worries and we got no cares
","Watching Ted it took me all the way back to my long ago childhood when I had a Teddy Bear. I certainly envied Mark Wahlberg for getting his Christmas wish. Of course the story involves Mark possibly outgrowing the need for a talking Teddy Bear. And that song from my childhood Me and my Teddy Bear kept running through my head.Ted is a charming fantasy about a young boy who grows up to be Mark Wahlberg wishing for and getting his Teddy Bear to turn into a live creature. The bear named Ted of course grows up with Wahlberg and the childish pleasures they shared, are now adult pleasures. Some very adult pleasures.All this is coming between Wahlberg and the girl he loves Mila Kunis. She gives him an understandable ultimatum, me or the bear. As Ted is truly a unique creature, no one in the history of planet earth was ever faced with that choice. How Mark resolves it is for you to see in the movie.If you do see it, I'd think long and hard about taking minor kids to it. Ted is funny, but funny for adults.I have to single out Giovanni Ribisi and young Aedin Mincks who if Wahlberg is ready to give up Ted, they'll have him. These two will creep you out and no one I would hold near and dear would get near them. Also Seth McFarlane was great in his creation of Ted both in voice and animation.Nice enjoyable film, but not one for the kids.",7,2,5,1 February 2013
Black Book," Cause Or Vendetta
","Back in the days of the Third Reich when by law it was permissible to treat some people as less than human, it wasn't enough to just kill people. You had to make sure that the state confiscated all their valuables and maybe the state's helpers, helped themselves. And that's what the story of Zwartboek is all about. It's seen through the eyes of a Jewish survivor who did what she had to do to survive. By the merest chance Carice Van Houten sees her whole family massacred after being scammed out of everything they had by someone who was going to help them and others escape from the Netherlands. Surviving that she finds her way into the Resistance and then because of a chance meeting with a top Gestapo man played by Sebastian Koch with whom she gives her all to find out useful information in general and what exactly happened to her folks in particular.Zwartboek made over 60 years after the Germans were cleared out of the Netherlands is a mature look back at some terrible times. The Nazis of course are evil, but the Resistance people aren't idealistic heroes. They're allies of convenience in many respects, lots of serious comments about other people's shortcomings are made by characters regarding religion, ethnicity, and politics. Van Houten is accused of caring only about Jews and working on her own personal vendetta.Sebastian Koch is also a three dimensional character. He's a widower having lost his family in an Allied raid on Hamburg and as such a very easy victim for the charms of Van Houten. But he's also rather ruthlessly seeing which way the wind is blowing and looking to come out of the war alive. Lots of mixed motivations and cross purposes working in Zwatboek.This German-Dutch production sad to say got no recognition from our own Academy Awards though it seemed to be nominated for something in just about every other country's film society. Shot on location in the Netherlands, Zwartboek is an uncompromising look back at some times that we should be forced to remember.",8,2,5,20 December 2009
Creed," Gets better with age
","Although young Michael B. Jordan has the title role in Creed the film really belongs to Sylvester Stallone. Sly joins an exclusive club of players like Bing Crosby, Paul Newman, and Al Pacino who got two Oscar nominations for playing the same role. In the case of Sly and Newman both aged naturally into the parts of Rocky Balboa and Eddie Felson. It's hard to believe that it has been 39 years since Stallone debuted Rocky Balboa. It's also 39 years between the nominations that Stallone got for Best Actor for Rocky and Best Supporting Actor for Creed.But between that there have been several Rocky films over the years as Sly has developed more facets to the fighting Mr. Balboa of Philadelphia than I'm sure he even thought of when he debuted Rocky. It all really comes together with Creed.But as for the story it seems that back when Apollo Creed was killed in that fight with that Russian steroid machine Dolph Lundgren in Rocky IV he had a dalliance that resulted in a post mortem birth of an illegitimate son who grew up to be Michael B. Jordan, character name of Adonis Johnson. Apollo's widow Phyllis Rashad took him out of foster care as his natural mother had died and raised him.Jordan has an interesting dichotomy to deal with. He's his father's son and wants to make it in the fight game, but on his own as Adonis Johnson. He seeks his father's old friend and rival Rocky Balboa as a mentor and Rocky trains him for a title shot at the light heavyweight championship. Rocky Balboa is not the most articulate movie hero ever developed, but he sure imparts a lot of wisdom to Jordan. Those scenes with Jordan are what got Sly Stallone that second Oscar nomination. Also Rocky has some personal crises of his own to deal with. These guys are of incalculable help to each other.I really loved this film and how Stallone developed Rocky to this point. Like fine wine, Rocky gets better with age.",8,34,52,2 April 2016
The Great Dictator," The Tramp Finally Speaks
","Charlie Chaplin certainly put off speaking on cinema long enough. His bread and butter was made with his little tramp character on the silent screen. But when Chaplin finally did speak he spoke some of the most memorable prose ever spoken on the cinema. The eloquence of his appeal for universal brotherhood is maybe more relevant today than even back in 1940 when he decided to satirize Nazi Germany in The Great Dictator.In his memoirs Chaplin said that he would never have made The Great Dictator had he suspected for a moment exactly the extent of what was going on in Nazi Germany. It was bad enough in 1940, but of course Hitler's final solution doctrine about systematic extermination wasn't put in place until the following year. After that Nazi Germany provided damn few laughs.As the film opens Chaplin hearkens back to his World War I classic Shoulder Arms when we see him as a bumbling soldier during World War I. He saves the life of air ace Reginald Gardiner, but in doing so is injured and loses his memory. Some fifteen years later Charlie regains his memory and leaves the hospital and returns to his profession as barber in the Jewish quarter of his native city.No one notices, but the little barber with the funny mustache bears no small resemblance to the dictator of his country of Ptomania, Adenoid Hynkel. And as it turns out Reginald Gardiner who is a storm trooper commandant gets reacquainted with his savior and has a reassessment of his feelings about Jews. Of course in the end that resemblance proves to be Gardiner and Chaplin's salvation and in Chaplin's fantasy world the salvation of humanity.In his Hynkel persona Chaplin was the first on the screen to satirize Hitler, to make him an object of ridicule. Later on when America was finally in World War II in some of our lesser propaganda efforts, Hitler impersonators like Bobby Watson leaned heavily on what Chaplin did in The Great Dictator. Of course his best Hynkel moment is the famous dream scene where the globe becomes a big beach ball type balloon with Chaplin lovingly treating it in the best fetishistic manner. As the barber Chaplin also goes back to his little tramp roots and is seen giving one of his customers a shave to the music of Brahm's Number 5 Dance could have been done in any of his silent classics. Chaplin's final speech was a masterpiece. People like Orson Welles, Paul Muni, and Spencer Tracy are probably the players most noted for giving long addresses well on screen, but for a man whose cinematic career was spent in silence up to that point, Chaplin was nothing short of brilliant. When the Tramp finally spoke, what profound things he had to say.The Great Dictator made a pile of money for United Artists of whom one of the partners was Charlie Chaplin. It received five Oscar nominations for Best Picture, Best Actor for Chaplin, Best Supporting Actor for Jack Oakie, Best Musical Score for Meredith Willson, and Best Original Screenplay for Chaplin. Curiously enough Charlie wasn't nominated for Best Director. Casting Jack Oakie as the spoof dictator Nappoloni based on that other Axis partner Mussolini was a stroke of genius. Oakie played loudmouth blowhards his entire film career and as Nappoloni of Bacteria, Oakie played one of the biggest blowhards in history. Oakie lost to Walter Brennan for The Westerner and Chaplin gave way to Jimmy Stewart in The Philadelphia Story. Chaplin did win the New York Film Critic's Award for Best Actor in 1940.Others worthy of note are Charlie's then estranged wife Paulette Goddard as the barber's love interest. Paulette who was Paulette Levy by birth played a Jew for maybe the only time in her career. Henry Daniell is minister of propaganda Garbitsch and he's his usual cold and cynical, but Charlie should have gotten Martin Kosleck who got a lot of work during World War II with a dead-on impersonation of Joseph Goebbels. For Air Minister Herring who would you get for the weight challenged Herman Goerring, but Billy Gilbert.In a world where a lot of self seeking politicians and terrorists appeal to the worst in man, The Great Dictator is timeless because of its appeal to the better angels of our nature as James Madison phrased it. Never miss this when it is broadcast it will renew your human spirit.",10,3,5,30 November 2010
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," The 10 Day Time Limit
","How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days is both the film title and what Kate Hudson has pledged to do as research for an article for a women's magazine she works for. Not that she wants to write this tripe, but it's what is expected of her at the magazine she works for. Their readers don't want serious political stuff like what she wants to do.She picks as the object of her love 'em and lose 'em experiment, one Matthew McConaughey who is an advertising writer and quite the player. And wouldn't you know it, he's got a bet on with his alpha male pals that he can keep a woman on a string for 10 days.But as films like these inevitably go, the two actually fall for each other, unexpected consequences for the leads, but hardly for the movie-going public.McConaughey and Hudson register well as the leads and their scenes do have some tenderness and some bite when it's appropriate. But when she's on the screen, Kate's boss Bebe Neuwirth steals the film. If you thought Meryl Streep was a tough woman to work for in The Devil Wears Prada, check Neuwirth out here.Best scenes in the film for the leads are Hudson and McConaughey at a Knicks game and later at his apartment where he's prepared a sumptuous meal. She does some really great stuff to turn him off.How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days is a pleasant romantic comedy, nothing terribly special about it, but fans of the leads won't be disappointed.",6,0,0,20 March 2010
Alexander," Adventurer/Conqueror and open gay man
","Being a fan of the classical school of acting I have a particular fondness for the 1956 Alexander The Great that starred Richard Burton. He was a guy born to play roles like that, just like Charlton Heston. Still Oliver Stone's Alexander has much to recommend it, especially with them finally dealing with the fact the man was gay in a society that sexual orientation didn't matter. In 1956 they could only be most subtle on that issue and Burton's Alexander contained not a trace.The love of his life was a childhood friend named Hephastrion and the relationship between Colin Farrell and Jared Leto as Alexander and Hephastrion is quite clear. But one of the duties of a monarch is to provide for orderly succession in any culture. When Farrell marries Rosario Dawson the Babylonian princess it is to provide heirs for a world he's uniting.Which brings me to his relationship with his father Philip of Macedon played here by Val Kilmer. One thing you can't have is whispers about paternity even if Zeus is the biological father which Queen Olympias keeps saying about her son. Angelina Jolie is Olympias and she's got a most tempestuous relationship with Kilmer. A few hints in that direction lead him to silencing those rumors and in turn a court party centered around Prince Alexander takes action to insure his successor.Like so many adventurer/conquerors Alexander is convinced of the superiority of the Greek way of life. Still even after conquest he does leave local customs intact if for no other reason is that you can't keep leaving occupying forces lest you diminish your conquering army. A unique idea for its day, practiced most recently by General Douglas MacArthur when he was running Japan and quite well.Oliver Stone offers some new and fresh insights to Alexander where we finally now talk about his sexual orientation. For those who protested this film, I say Alexander is here and queer.",8,2,4,1 July 2012
Hot Fuzz," A Town Like Stepford, oops Sandford
","This film did not get too much play in the USA and I count myself fortunate that I'm close enough to the Canadian border to get these occasional gems broadcast from the CBC. Lucky indeed that the CBC is part of my cable package.Simon Pegg is a too good to be true London police officer who is wracking up arrests and making his colleagues look shameful. It's decided that the place to go to cool that zeal off a bit is the quiet and peaceful rural town of Sandford. In the United Kingdom it's the most crime free zone in the whole country.In fact Pegg looks like he's going to die of sheer boredom. He makes four collars for minor offenses even before he officially is on the job there. It looks like he is not going to be a good fit for this quiet town. The only friend that Pegg has on the Sandford PD is Nick Frost, the somewhat oafish son of Broadbent whom Pegg is assigned as a partner. Frost who just loves American action flicks with guns and car chases would love for there to be something afoot.The story behind Hot Fuzz is really quite bizarre and you'd have to go to the American film The Stepford Wives for a comparison. There are no experiments going on to turn the Sandford women into docile feminine drones, it's a mindset that has taken control of the place. The most sinister character is that of Timothy Dalton who is very much like the Arthur Hill character in The Stepford Wives.This sleeper of a black comedy is really quite a gem. I hope that Hot Fuzz gets discovered on this side of the pond.",8,1,1,4 September 2011
The Natural," The greatest of them all
","Bernard Malamud's novel about baseball and lost opportunities in life was written
in 1952 but finally got to the big screen in 1984. Robert Redford is our protagonist Roy Hobbs who missed his big opportunity to have a career following
a shooting incident. 16 years later at an age when players are retiring he gets
signed as a rookie for the New York Knights (Giants) and becomes a Joe Hardy
like sensation.Like Joe Hardy there's some deviltry at work in the form of Robert Prosky the
team owner in league with Arnold Rothstein like bookmaker Darren McGavin
who want to bet against the fast rising Knights powered by Redford.The film has a real baseball feel to it and Malamud dipped into baseball lore
to come up with his characters. Joe Don Baker as The Whammer is a not too
veiled portrayal of Babe Ruth. Michael Madsen who crashes into the outfield
wall and fractures a skull is based on Dodger outfielder Pete Reiser who ended
his career though not fatally with too many encounters with Ebbets Field's
outfield wall. Hobbs himself as we see him practicing in the Iowa cornfield
is Bob Feller no doubt.The Natural is impeccably cast besides those mentioned there is Robert Duvall
the sportswriter who both eventually remember where he saw Redford before
and who smells a rat in the pennant race. His character is based on legendary
sportswriter Hugh Fullerton who discovered the Black Sox scandal. Wilford
Brimley is the crusty old manager of the Knights and Richard Farnsworth his
coach.For a change women in this baseball movie got some roles of substance. Barbara Hershey is brief but memorable as a deranged baseball groupie who
shoots Redford in the abdomen, said incident based on the shooting of Phillies
first baseman Eddie Waitkus. Kim Basinger plays another baseball groupie,
a temptress to lead Redford astray. And Glenn Close got a Supporting Actress
nomination as his faithful girlfriend.The Natural got other nominations for Best Music Score, Art Direction, and
Cinematography.Redford looked pretty good on the field, a lot better than Gary Cooper for
instance playing Lou Gehrig. The Natural takes its place among the great
films about baseball.",8,0,2,8 April 2019
Troy," There Love Sank A Civilization
","The epic story of the siege of Troy, one of the oldest tales of the civilized world, was the basis for a return of the big budget sand and sandal epics of the Fifties and Sixties as the big studios were spending tons of money on films to make them bigger and better to compete with television. It's as spectacular as anything that Cecil B. DeMille did without the 19th century Victorian prose that his scripts were laced with. In fact it's better because DeMille did not have computer graphics available to him.One of the criticisms I hear about the film was that it was not comprehensive enough in terms of telling the whole story. To tell this whole story would require a lengthy mini-series and this was made for the big screen. If a two hour and 40 minute version of the story constitutes a Reader's Digest version of same, than so be it. The basic parts were covered and the errors are purely in the interest of editing.Brendon Gleeson is King Meneleus of Sparta and he has a lovely young trophy queen named Helen played by Diane Kruger. Paris the son of King Priam of Troy is on a diplomatic mission from his city state which is across the Aegean Sea and in what is now Turkey. Orlando Bloom as Paris who is a rather shallow and callow youth, takes one look at Helen and she him and the chemistry gets going. He sneaks her aboard the Trojan ship before word is out and she's in Troy before you can say cuckolded.Of course Meneleus ain't taking this lying down and he gets together with the rulers of the other Greek city states and they put together a D-Day like invasion and the siege begins. Although you wouldn't know it from the film, it lasts 10 years and that's really the only fault of the film. But again it's in the interest of editing.A lot of the success of the invasion depends on the legendary Greek warrior Achilles and his elite guard called the Myrmidons. Achilles is played by a bulked up Brad Pitt and it's one of his best performances. Although my favorite role of Pitt's is in Seven Years In Tibet, this one is cited by his many fans in saying that Brad's come of age as an actor and not just a pretty face.The climax is the famous fight between Orlando Bloom's brother, Prince Hector of Troy and Achilles. Hector slew young Patroclus played by Garrett Hedlund who was in Achilles armor and Achilles is out for blood. It's a no quarter match when Achilles slays Hector and with it a lot of the hopes and dreams of Troy. Hector is played well by Eric BanaMy favorite scene is when King Priam goes out on the field to claim Hector's body and meets Achilles. Priam is played by Peter O'Toole and I'm surprised O'Toole did not get yet another Oscar nomination for Priam in the Supporting Actor category. Achilles the disillusioned warrior because he sees the greed and rapaciousness of the Greek kings and Priam the heartbroken but still proud ruler of Troy who has to see his duty through meet and gain a mutual respect for the other. This scene between Pitt and O'Toole is the best in the film by far.Reading the ancient text by Homer, the Greek Gods play significant parts in the drama. Here they are acknowledged, but make no presence in the film. It's a most secular story indeed and is criticized by some for that reason, but I find no fault with it.The best reason to see Troy is to awaken an appreciation of the classics, especially among the young. If this Reader's Digest version of Homer's epic, inspires someone to do just that, it will be well worth the budget.",10,2,8,13 November 2007
Dead Poets Society," Always question authority
","The conformist 50s get a look in Dead Poet's Society. Seen through the eyes of several prep school kids it's only that several of them really grasp what Robin Williams is trying to teach them that we see hope for the future.Williams is one of those rare teachers whose unorthodox methods make him stand out. There will always two or three for me in every level of learning that I had who stuck with me. The kids at Welton Prep actually enjoy his poetry class, they even found a little private club the Dead Poet's Society and will quote Byron, Browning, and the Bard back and forth to each other.The difference between Williams and someone like Norman Lloyd the headmaster at Welton Prep is that Lloyd sees himself as training the future membership of the establishment and he's giving them the lessons they need to get by, Williams says that his function to tell the youth to question authority. Always ask why this is so. Progress is only made by those who ask questions.The film is mainly the story of two students in his class Robert Sean Leonard and Ethan Hawke. Leonard is a shy kid and Hawke is a popular one. But Hawke is not from a wealthy family. His father Kurtwood Smith has made many sacrifices to get him into that prep school. Hawke wants to be an actor and Williams says follow your dream. Their clash sets in motion the dramatic events of the climax.Dead Poet's Society won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay and was nominated for Best Picture, Best Director as well. Williams got a nomination for Best Actor. Dead Poet's Society maybe set in the 50s, but it expresses a universal theme about always question the status quo until you get a satisfying answer.Progress never happens any other way.",9,0,0,22 July 2017
Brokeback Mountain," A Working Class Gay Love Story
","Having just come from the premiere showing of Brokeback Mountain in my city, the thing that struck me is that it is a working class story. Strip away all the glamour and mystique about being a cowboy and we are talking about two knock around working class men in Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal. Ledger and Gyllenhaal could have been steelworkers, auto workers, plumbers, even sanitation men. Technically speaking they're not even cowboys, they're sheepherders. That's how they meet, Randy Quaid hires them to watch his sheep which are grazing on government land on Brokeback Mountain. They certainly aren't in professions that are dominated by gays.The story is that on that mountain, the gay urge in both of them comes out and they begin an over 20 year relationship from that summer on Brokeback. This however is 1963, six years before Stonewall, and a generation before any open gay life comes to the state of Wyoming. It's still a dangerous place Wyoming as the ghost of Matthew Shepard would so testify.So Ennis Delmar and Jack Twist are forced for the sake of convention to lead false lives. Both marry and have children, and both even love their families. But the romance is reserved for each other.Brokeback Mountain for today's audience speaks to whole generations of Gay/Lesbian/Bisexual/Transgendered people for whom living an open life was not an option. I hope a lot of the young people see it and realize how hard it was for their elders to be as open as so many more gay folk are.The film also speaks to what it is still like for many GLBT people in a rural setting. Even back in 1963 Ennis and Jack had they lived in a large city, might have found a community with some kind of support. Their aloneness is the real heart of Brokeback Mountain.Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal deliver some Oscar calibre performances here. Given the normal tradition of the Academy if they both receive Best Actor nominations, they might just split the vote and neither will get it. Brokeback Mountain will no doubt take some awards away at this year's Oscar ceremonies in any event. Hopefully for the producers who had the courage to bring this story to the screen.Maybe someone should be searching now for a property concerning two women and also transgendered people and what aloneness they felt in generations past.",10,23,29,6 January 2006
Ed Wood," His Talent Did Not Match His Ideas
","Poor Ed Wood, celebrated only now not for any great work he achieved in life, but for the spectacular mediocrity of his productions. Yet I'd like to think that somewhere in the great beyond Edward Wood, Jr. is pleased at how Tim Burton and Johnny Depp captured the very soul of a man who was born too soon or too late for various points in history.As a biographer on his page at IMDb correctly points out during the hey day of the Poverty Row studios he could have settled comfortably in a career putting out shlock and making a living at it, had he come along in the Thirties. If Ed Wood were a young man today, he would find acceptance and support for his cross-dressing in a growing movement for transgender rights.It was his sad misfortune to come of age in the fifties when movies were competing with television and could no longer inflict shlock on the public. He could no longer get work at Monogram or PRC or any of those other minor studios as a hack writer. But Wood was ambitious and like Orson Welles who he idolized he wanted to be a one man creative force.As a cross-dresser Wood dreamed of a project that could explain his story and the stories of millions of others. He went to battle in several campaigns in the Marines with female undergarments. As Johnny Depp tells us his biggest fear was getting wounded lest his secret be discovered.In his film Glen or Glenda he tried hard to tell of the duality of his sexual nature. Sad he didn't have the talent to pull it off.Johnny Depp who made a deliberate career choice of eschewing teenage idol roles which he could have had after 21 Jump Street, notches his best screen performance as Ed Wood. Depp should have gotten at least an Oscar nomination for Best Actor.One man who did win an Oscar in Ed Wood was Martin Landau who really does make you think you're watching Bela Lugosi. A Lugosi who puts aside the mask of horror he wore on his public face and lets you into his inner sanctum. A broken 70 something narcotic addicted actor who forms a great kinship with Wood because he feels needed and wanted again by somebody. And Wood basks in the attention that a former film star gives him. It's one of the most touching symbiotic relationships ever shown on screen. Landau's Best Supporting Actor was a foregone conclusion.Long after the action of this film concluded Ed Wood died in 1953 in total obscurity. Johnny Depp and Tim Burton have given his life meaning in this film. As transgender people demand their just due in the public square, I'd like to think that an eighty something Ed Wood would be right in the forefront of things. I myself went to Washington, DC this year and lobbied with a number of transgender folks all over the country for federal hate crimes and anti-discrimination laws as a friend and ally. Ed Wood would be there no doubt in my mind.I'm willing to bet that he would have been doing a documentary on a subject near and dear to him. And it would have been a subject near and dear and Oscar caliber stuff like his own life story was.",10,7,8,5 September 2007
The Hustler," Equal Measure Of Ambition And Vulnerability
","The Hustler had the misfortune to be up against films like West Side Story and Judgment at Nuremberg in 1961. Another year it might have carried away more Academy gold than just for black and white cinematography and for black and white art&set direction.A lot of people think The Hustler is about pool, what it really is about is obsession at being the best and how it can cost you in other things that really matter.Paul Newman as Eddie Felson is one such obsessed creature. He wants to be the best pool player ever. To do that in the words of that eminent 20th century philosopher Ric Flair, 'to be the man, you got to beat the man.'The man is Jackie Gleason playing the legendary Minnesota Fats, champion pool player of all. They have a marathon match in which Newman seems to have the upper hand, but Gleason pulls it out in the end. Nevertheless Newman comes to the attention of George C. Scott, a gambler who wants to use him for his own ends.Jackie Gleason and George C. Scott both got nominated in the Best Supporting Actor category, but lost to George Chakiris in West Side Story. Scott is a dangerous and malevolent figure, he was probably at his most evil on the screen in this role. Piper Laurie got an Oscar nomination for Best Actress and this turned out to be her career role. She's an alcoholic floozy with some dreams that keep her ego afloat, but she loves and respects Newman. They complement each other's needs and Newman finds that out way too late. Laurie unfortunately lost to Sophia Loren in Two Women.But what I liked best about The Hustler is the contrast between Paul Newman and Jackie Gleason. Gleason is on screen at the beginning and at the end. Note how he sits apart from everyone in the pool room. No social life, no people in his orbit, it's lonely at the top. And to stay there Gleason dedicates himself to pool to the exclusion of everything else.Yet this is who the ambitious, but very vulnerable Newman wants to be. In creating his character Newman gave it equal doses of ambition and vulnerability, both working at the same time. Not an easy thing to do, but Newman is at the top of his game as Eddie Felson. Sadly Newman lost the Oscar that year to Maximilian Schell in Judgment at Nuremberg.But eventually some 25 years later Paul Newman got the Oscar for playing a more mature Eddie Felson in The Color of Money. A kind of justice, certainly few players ever get that kind of opportunity again.The Hustler was also up for Best Picture and Best Director for Robert Rossen. It lost to West Side Story in both categories. Both films hold up well after almost half a century, that was a tough call for Academy voters.The Hustler is about pool the way Moby Dick is about a whale. And there both classics.",10,5,7,17 December 2007
Spotlight," Well assembled ensemble
","As we know Spotlight pulled off something of an upset at the 2015 Oscars by winning for Best Picture. It might have not been my first choice, still it is a good film dealing with a most distasteful subject, molestation by Roman Catholic priests of minors.For centuries the priesthood has been a refuge for closeted gay men who were then never questioned about their lack of interest in women. Then along came Stonewall and gay liberation and chances undreamed of for gays to live openly. So there was no longer a need to enter the priesthood. That caused a lot of vacancies and to this day the Catholic Church has never filled all the openings.Secondly celibacy is just one insane requirement. Back 1000 years ago when it was introduced we never knew about libidos and sex drives. For some with low or no sex drive it's no big deal. But some of us have needs. Put it together you have a recipe for pedophilia.Not that this wasn't known. Back in my younger days I knew a family that numbered a priest among a few brothers. This individual while an ordained priest ran for NYS Assembly. But one day we heard he was transferred to a new parish on an Indian reservation in the southwest. That was a favorite dumping ground for priests from the New York Archdiocese who got caught and were in too many parishes. Cardinal Francis J. Spellman's favorite exile place. Maybe Cardinal Bernard Law if he knew about what Spellman did he might have put off what happened to his Archdiocese in Boston. This all started with the expose of one Father John Geoghan who was transferred to many parishes in the Archdiocese after it got out he had a taste for young boys. What the team of investigative reporters from the Boston Globe did was tell the wider story and the film is their search for evidence. The film is always compared with All The President's Men and how the Washington Post broke the Watergate story. One big difference is that a couple of high powered box office names in Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford led the cast. No big names in Spotlight's cast, just a well assembled ensemble. In fact two of the cast Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams were nominated for Best Supporting Actor and Best Supporting Actress respectively. You might well ask the question, who were they in support of?Spotlight is a good film, not a great one, but it has a few moments. One that is unforgettable for me is Rachel McAdams on the trail of her story going to the house of a former priest. If there were an award for brief significant performances category than Richard O'Rourke as the defrocked priest would have got it for that year. Watch Rachel's reactions as O'Rourke who is so clearly not emotionally developed starts talking of his experiences. Then he's cut off from McAdams by his sister played by Nancy Carroll who is protective of her child like brother and orders her off the premises. That scene told you a lot about many who went into that vocation.I don't think the great film on the subject has yet been made. But Spotlight will do until it is.",7,7,12,15 March 2016
Aquaman," Lying there Under, under the sea
","Aquaman of DC comics finally gets his top billing in a film as the nicely put together Jason Momoa plays the title role in this science fiction epic. Already a
sequel is in the works, in fact this film ends on an uncertain note setting up the
story line for the sequel.Lighthouse keeper Temura Morrison finds a woman with a trident on his beach
and takes her in. Nicole Kidman is the woman and she's the queen of the under
sea kingdom of Atlantis and she's running away from all that. The two fall in
love and have a kid who grows up to be Jason Momoa.But before that some Atlantian warriors show up and try to kidnap Kidman.
They're all killed, but Kidman decides to go back lest more come and harm her

Sword And The Stone and Aquaman. Momoa's earth name is Arthur Curry for
that matter. Now all grown up and quite fit and cut he's summoned to Atlantis to claim the crown. But first he has to find a magical trident stuck in a rock

L.A. Confidential," Eisenhower Era LA
","I think that all LA Confidential needed was possibly the writing touch of someone like Raymond Chandler or Dashiell Hammett. But since those two worthy gentleman are beyond reach, this is as good as it will get for the modern cinema.Anticipating the film Crash by several years, LA Confidential is a period piece set in the Eisenhower era Los Angeles and its police department which has a history of corruption more than most. A whole lot of separate incident are tied together quite intricately as the cast's three police heroes, together and separately piece it all together.Three very different kinds of cops are portrayed here. First is the laid back Kevin Spacey who has a casual attitude towards the corruption he sees. He's also the police adviser to a Dragnet style show and enjoys a whole lot of perks that come with it.Secondly is Guy Peace who's a real boy scout, but is the son of a hero cop and also knows how to work department politics. He doesn't look the other way on corruption, he rises in rank because he turned in fellow officers and he's hated up and down the line.Finally there's Russell Crowe whose character reminds me of the big dumb son in House of Strangers played by Paul Valentine who Edward G. Robinson made a guard in his bank. Even in the days before the Miranda decision, Crowe made a specialty of getting confessions the old fashioned way. Certain higher ups, particularly Captain James Cromwell recognize his unique talents and call him in when needed. Like Valentine though he proves in the end to be quite a bit smarter than everyone gives him credit for.The beating of some Mexican prisoners, the massacre of six people at a Hollywood Diner, a call girl service where the girls are made up to look like movie stars, a bisexual actor killed at a sleazy motel, and a whole lot more are all part of an complex story that won one of two Oscars LA Confidential received, for best screenplay adapted from another source.The second Oscar went to Kim Basinger as one of the call girls who is made up like Veronica Lake. She gets all the men in this cast into maxim hormonal overdrive, especially Pearce and Crowe. Basinger won for Best Supporting Actress that year.Woven into the story are such real characters as mob boss Mickey Cohen whose arrest for tax evasion sets up a lot of the situations here, his number one enforcer Johnny Stompanato and Lana Turner who would shortly be some of the biggest tabloid fodder ever.Look also for some nice performances from Ron Rifkin as the blackmailed District Attorney and Danny DeVito as a sleazy columnist.Had LA Confidential not come along in the same year as Titanic it might have won a few more Oscars including Best Picture which it lost to Titanic. Still the success of Crash, a film with similar structure and themes may redeem LA Confidential.Not that it needs much redemption because you won't be bored for an LA minute.",10,10,15,28 May 2008
The Day After Tomorrow," A Plea For Kyoto
","I'm certainly in no position to comment on the science put forth in this film. When I was going to school, I remember being taught in science class that the Ice Age was a gradual process that took place over thousands of years and then it took thousands again to reverse it. Of course we didn't have man around using all the planet's resources for industry. But scientist Dennis Quaid says that the Ice Age will dawn upon man again and soon. But it happens a whole lot sooner than even he predicts and the nations of the world pay for it.The first half of the film is Quaid's struggle in vain to persuade our government, particularly a Vice President played by Kenneth Welsh who bears no accidental resemblance to Dick Chaney of the folly of its environmental policy.When doomsday strikes, the action shifts to Quaid trekking to New York to rescue his son Jake Gyllenhaal who is trapped in the New York Public Library with other kids from an Academic Bowl they were participating in. IF the science is open to speculation, the special effects are spectacular. Personally the sight of that freighter sailing up a flooded 42nd Street is something to behold. And the whiz kids who survive prove to be pretty resourceful.The Day After Tomorrow is Hollywood's appeal for the USA to sign and obey the Kyoto Accords. Hollywood has taken up worse causes.",7,6,9,5 June 2007
A Bridge Too Far," The Allies Overreach
","Although A Bridge Too Far, the story of the Allied failed offensive operation in the Netherlands known as Market Garden is based on a book by Cornelius Ryan who also wrote The Longest Day, it doesn't quite reach the classic heights of that film. Maybe because the Allies don't quite reach their objective and pay a terrible price.I'm not quite sure that Dwight D. Eisenhower did not leave World War II with the biggest migraine headache of all time, having to contend with all the egos he did there. You can read the various memoirs and books about his subordinates, both British and American and the common thread that runs through all of them is how if Ike only listened to me, the war would have been over six to nine months earlier in Europe. And the sad thing is he had to balance military with domestic political considerations for both countries.The events of September 17-25 of 1944 are what A Bridge Too Far depict. The idea was for Allied Airbourne Divisions both American and British to take a series of bridges in the Netherlands to facilitate the Rhine crossing into the Ruhr Valley of Germany. This was and is Germany's industrial heartland. Imagine if you will an operation to take bridges across the Ohio River to invade the industrial mid-west in the USA and you have some idea. Then the ground troops would invade and link the various isolated airborne troops and everybody go across the Rhine and into Germany. In his memoirs one the best British commanders of World War II, Sir Brian Horrocks said that if the Allies had known that the Germans had mined the Schelde estuary leading to the port of Antwerp, Market Garden might have been feasible. If they had the use of Antwerp, because they had taken it at considerable cost, a steady supply line might have been available and half of what you see in A Bridge Too Far wouldn't have happened. The other big failure of Market Garden was the lack of usable roads to get the Allied tanks over. Horrocks is played by Edward Fox in the film and he's in command of ground troops. The Airborne Commander is Frederick 'Boy' Browning played by Dirk Bogarde.The best role in the film is that of Sean Connery as the Commander of the most forward of the Allied Airborne armies playing General Roy Urquhart. It's quite true as depicted in the film that Urquhart was prone to airsickness. Urquhart spent nine days at the bridge too far as it turned out at Arnhem. He very nearly became a prisoner of war as his very graphically shown. Had the Germans captured Urquhart he would have been the highest ranking Allied General taken prisoner since General Richard O'Connor in the African desert in 1940.Lots of American and British name players populate director Richard Attenborough's cast. Ryan O'Neal is General James M. Gavin a hero at D-Day whose 82nd Airborne was put under British command and did their job. Robert Redford is a major who makes a heroic attempt to rescue Connery's forces. James Caan has a nice part as an Army sergeant who forces a tired army doctor played by Arthur Hill at gunpoint to operate and save his lieutenant's life.One of the best scenes in the film is Laurence Olivier as a Dutch doctor who is treating Allied wounded at Liv Ullman's house who goes and asks for a truce to get his wounded into the tender care of the Nazis. S.S. General Hardy Kruger would just as soon kill them all, but Maximilian Schell as German commander Bittner allows the truce.One thing I loved about A Bridge Too Far is John Addison's music score for the film. It's right on par with the theme from The Longest Day that Paul Anka wrote.Military historians will love A Bridge Too Far, it's a great example of one of the 'what ifs' of history.",9,24,28,28 February 2008
Milk," Life Begins At 40
","I remember back in 1978 when I heard about the assassinations in San Francisco. The screaming headlines read Mayor Moscone Murdered on the tabloid News and Post in New York. You read the article and it said that a San Francisco City Supervisor named Harvey Milk was also killed by another supervisor Dan White.What I didn't know was how much Harvey Milk reflected my own life. A former Goldwater Republican and closeted gay man, he moved to San Francisco and affected a revolution. That was me and three years later I came out and started doing my own thing for the same righteous cause, Milk gave his life for.Milk was not the first openly gay person elected to public office. Elaine Noble and Allan Spears were serving in state legislatures when Milk finally was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. Milk was not a single elected official in a large body of legislators. He became the focus of stopping a rollback of our rights that the newly empowered religious right was seeking to do and God help us, still seeks to do. San Francisco no longer is THE gay city as it was in Harvey Milk's last eight years of his life. So many places now have GLBT rights laws, so many have created their own gay culture and network. Still all of us owe so much to Harvey Milk and his circle who would not back down.A few days ago I saw Sean Penn in Bad Boys and to see him 25 years later as Harvey Milk, it's hard to believe the breadth of work that he's done as a player. There's a nomination in this for Best Actor and maybe a second one to go with the one Penn won for Dead Man Walking. You are so taken with his performance that you forget and think you're watching a hidden newsreel of the life of Harvey Milk.Josh Brolin might very well bring home an Oscar for the uptight Dan White, the assassin. What's extraordinary about Brolin's performance is that White is such an ordinary man, trapped with a set of values that taught him to despise anything different than him. There's some suggestion that White was a latent case and that might have been the ultimate reason for his terrible acts. I've seen that happen often enough in my life.In my working days before retirement in 2002 I was the only openly gay person at the New York State Crime Victims Board working there and still am, sad to say. Harvey Milk was brought to political activism by someone he knew being targeted for hate crime homicide which was never solved. In the more enlightened times of the Eighties and Nineties these things still go too often unpunished. Like Harvey these incidents were my reason for involvement.Watching Milk and inner circle many of whom went on to do great things in the Gay Rights movement, I envied them. I certainly put my years in, still do. But I would have given anything to have been involved from the beginning. They have tragic memories, but also wonderful stories to tell about a cause bigger than themselves.And for that reason this review of this wonderful film is dedicated to a gay rights pioneer whom I knew and who recently passed away. Eleanor Cooper did her activism as an emigrant from Tennessee. She dedicated her life to making the world better for her GLBT brothers and sisters for more than 30 years in New York City. She was a prime leader in the passage of New York City's gay rights law. She was unflagging optimist and never lost faith that with education and reason people would get it about us. Her optimism was infectious, buoyed many a spirit in bad times, political and personal.Harvey Milk said that he had not really done anything he was truly proud of at the age of 40 just before moving from New York to San Francisco. If he did nothing else he gave hope and encouragement to untold numbers of young gay people that you're not worthless, that you had a mission on this earth to make the best life you can for yourself and for your brothers and sisters. The best scene in the film is Milk talking to a young kid from Minnesota who was contemplating suicide and who might very well have done it as too many have.The young man's name was Paul. And this review and this film is and should also be dedicated to all the Pauls and Paulas out there who are not going to accept a second class life from ignorant people. Not any place on this globe.",10,19,32,14 December 2008
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Saving An Ungrateful Humanity
","Ron Perlman repeats his characterization of Hellboy and saves humanity once again, this time from a Golden Army from his demon world. Although you have to wonder why he does this considering all the thanks he gets for it.Hellboy II: The Golden Army moves on to an even higher level entertainment than the original tongue in cheek production of the first Hellboy film. Hellboy is working for a secret government agency dealing with paranormal phenomenon when a demon prince invades an art auction and steals a piece of a magical crown. The prince, played by Luke Goss has a nasty demonic creature called a Wink.The object he stole is part of a crown which when he places it on its head will enable him to activate a golden robot like army that's invincible. Just see what these babies do after Hellboy and his cronies finish with them once. Talk about self repairing, YOIKES.Both Hellboy movies are a lot of fun because they don't take themselves to seriously. We never forget we are in fact watching a comic strip come to life.Hopefully Ron Perlman and his sidekicks Selma Blair and Doug Jones will be back for a Hellboy III.",8,4,9,16 July 2008
Cloverfield," First Camera Perspective
","Unless there was a lot of clover in the fields of Central Park where some of the story of Cloverfield takes place, I'm not sure of the significance of the title here.Director Matt Reeves had the interesting idea of filming this movie in the first camera perspective. The film is the recorded viewpoint of a video camera and whomever is holding it at the time. Just about every one of those Fifties Science Fiction films takes it from the viewpoint of the people who will eventually slay the monster or defeat the aliens, whatever. You see masses of folks running in panic from whatever the threat is.What we've got in Cloverfield is a group of ordinary 20 somethings having a party. When some kind of alien invasion hits New York City. Then the group of them take off in understandable panic in search of safety. The film is about that quest for safety.No name players of any kind are used here and to be sure that does give the audience a good identification. They're not a terribly interesting bunch though, I'm not sure if I really cared whether they made it or not.Cloverfield is an interesting, but not terribly entertaining science fiction film.",6,8,18,2 February 2008
Sleepy Hollow," You Can't Reason With A Headless Man
","Any resemblance between Washington Irving's whimsical tale of the Hudson Valley and this Tim Burton Gothic horror fest is purely coincidental. Of course that does not mean the film isn't good. Tim Burton and Johnny Depp have combined their talents to make a really good film.The original short story involved a bumpkin of a man in Ichabod Crane in love with Katrina Van Tassel who is also being courted by the local jock of the village Brom Bones. When he starts to get serious though the legendary headless horseman who is reputed to be the ghost of a Hessian mercenary from the revolution goes after Ichabad one dark and stormy night and he clears out of Sleepy Hollow. Irving is most cryptic about just what was the Headless Horseman that night.Instead of the bumpkin, Ichabad Crane is transformed into a Sherlock Holmes type constable sent from New York to uncover the mystery behind several beheadings. That's the character that Johnny Depp plays and he's soon courting Christina Ricci as Katrina to the jealousy of Casper Van Dien as Brom Bones.Tim Burton took and expanded the story and we meet the village of Sleepy Hollow who are living in mortal fear. But as Sherlock Holmes would say there is method in the seeming randomness of the Horseman and his victims. It's quite the convoluted plot that brews in Sleepy Hollow. Not only did Tim Burton get a great ensemble performance from his cast, but the film did a great job in recreating the Hudson Valley and at the beginning and end of the film, New York City in the Federalist era of the country. Great Gothic sets, I think Burton was inspired by some of the horror classics that Universal used to do back in the days of the studio system.In addition to those already mentioned, Michael Gambon and Miranda Richardson as Mr.&Mrs. Van Tassel, Michael Gough as the village notary and in flashback Christopher Walken as the Horseman before he went headless should all be singled out.Sleepy Hollow is a well done film and even though it is more Tim Burton than Washington Irving it will give you more than a few frights. As for Johnny Depp as his portrayal was more Sherlock Holmes than Ichabad Crane, perhaps he'll consider doing a Sherlock Holmes movie as a future project. We can only hope.",9,2,3,19 September 2010
Ready Player One," The most important game of his life
","I have to marvel at the computer graphics that Steven Spielberg used in creating
Ready Player One. Sad to say I am not of the gaming generation, the fascination
of playing these games hours on end is totally lost to me. My ignorance of these
matters makes it hard to follow the plot in something like this. For instance the
Matrix series. I've watched those films and I haven't reviewed them because I'm
not sure of what I watched. This was a bit better.In 2045 the world is really a rotten place and folks like young Tye Sheridan have retreated into their own cyber world called The Oasis. It's where with
avatars they can play their own games and win and lose in a much more interesting place than the Columbus, Ohio of the near future.Sheridan is now playing in the most important game of his life. At stake is
the ownership/patent of the Oasis created by eccentric Bill Gates type billionaire Mark Rylance. It's like Willy Wonka willing his Chocolate Factory to
a lucky kid. But this is much bigger stakes.This film is more than half in animation when Sheridan meets some of his
cyber friends once again as they all compete looking for prizes in the cyber
world called Easter Eggs. Get three and he's a winner.Sheridan does meet his friends again in the cyber world and in the real one.
He also has to fight in both.What the attraction is I don't know. But I'm happy that at the end, the world
gets a shot of needed reality.",6,1,1,20 January 2019
The Hateful Eight," Minnie's Haberdashery, where the elite meet
","You'd have to go back 80 years or so to the film adaptation of Sidney Kingsley's Dead End to find a film where the set qualifies as a living participant of the action. The house in the adaption of the Eugene O'Neill classic Long Day's Journey Into Night also qualifies here.The action is set up when the stagecoach where bounty hunter Kurt Russell is taking his prisoner Jennifer Jason Leigh to the town of Red Rock to be hung. A couple of prairie hitchhikers also come on board another bounty hunter Samuel L. Jackson and Walton Goggins son of a former Confederate general who says he's the new sheriff in the town of Red Rock. Kurt Russell replete with full flowing beard and mustache is one suspicious man. He has those suspicions justified before the film is ended.80% of the action takes place on set of the 19th century bed and breakfast during the time of a nasty Wyoming winter and does the dialog crackle. If you think you're going to see a western the kind that John Ford or Howard Hawks or Henry Hathaway did back in the old days, then don't watch The Hateful Eight. Hateful is the operating word with these characters, there's nothing really noble about any of them.Besides the set of Minnie's Haberdashery to recommend it, Quentin Tarrantino selected a truly fine ensemble cast who play beautifully off each other. As the outlaw queen Jennifer Jason Leigh got a Best Supporting Actress nomination, but in my humble opinion she doesn't stand out any more than any of the rest of them. The Hateful Eight also earned Ennio Morricone an Oscar for the best musical score for 2015.The Hateful Eight is a great western, but it ain't your grandpa's kind of western.",8,106,153,10 April 2016
Gettysburg," The turning point of the Civil War
","Anything you ever wanted to know about the battle of Gettysburg will be here in
this 4 1/2 hour film. The turning point of the Civil War, Gettysburg stopped a
series of victories won by Robert E. Lee. Had Lee won at Gettysburg he had nothing to stop him had he chosen to march north, east or west. It probably
would have meant a negotiated peace and two nations.It should be emphasized that Gettysburg is not a film concerning a defense of
slavery. It is about a lot of brave men who met outside a Pennsylvania town on
both sides. Some of the scenes between battle scenes show the commanders
on both sides talking about their relationships with folks on the other side
before the war. That the struggle tore people apart is well documented here.
People fought people who were friends before 1861 and geography tore them
apart.No computer graphics here. A cast of thousands, movie making on the scale
that Cecil B. DeMille used to practice. The repelling of the Confederate advance off Little Round Top and Pickett's charge are particularly well staged.My favorite scene is the anguish of Robert E. Lee played by Martin Sheen when
JEB Stuart finally reports. Stuart's cavalry which was indispensable to Lee
went off God knows where and Lee lacked vital intelligence. Sheen really dresses Joseph Fuqua as Stuart down, but then says you're still one of the best
I have.The battle was not planned at all. Advance troops of Lee's moved into Union
territory in southern Pennsylvania hearing of a shoe factory where Lee could
commandeer footwear for his troops, some of them marching barefoot. Advance Union troops engaged and more troops poured in from both sides.
The battle just grew from a skirmish to an epic.The Confederates get more time than the Yanks. But on the Yankee side
attention should be paid to Richard Anderson as Union commander George
Meade and Jeff Daniels as Joshua Chamberlain and Brian Mallon as Winfield
Scott Hancock. Tom Berenger has a big role he makes the most of as General
James Longstreet, probably Lee's most valuable corps commander.Like Birth Of A Nation, Gettysburg is some living history and makes great use
of some of the still photographs of the era. It is required viewing for Civil War
buffs.",10,1,1,17 April 2019
"I, Tonya"," What did Tonya know and when?
","Comparisons come to mind when thinking of both Tonya Harding and this excellent film about her life and that notorious incident that led to her disgrace
and banishment. The film is done almost as a homage to the faux documentary
style that Gus Van Sant used in To Die For which was based on the Elizabeth
Smart story. Both even had Australians as protagonists, Nicole Kidman for the
Van Sant film and gloriously memorable Margot Robbie for I Tonya.I racked my brain trying to think of a sports figure like Tonya Harding and the
closest I came up with was Shoeless Joe Jackson who came from a similar trailer park background that Harding did. He too listened to the worse angels
of his nature and got himself banned for life in his sport. Jackson had far less
education than Harding did, in fact he was almost illiterate. One thing about Jackson though his choice of life partner was a good one. By
all accounts his choice of life mate was inspired as Katie Winn Jackson stuck
loyally by him and was never a bad influence.That could not be said for Jeff Gillooly who had the same kind of trailer park
background that Tonya did and who let being the husband of a celebrity just
totally go to his head. Sebastian Stan whom I consider one of the best actors
around today plays Gillooly with an explosive intensity. As the sports press
built up this rivalry between Harding and Nancy Kerrigan, Gillooly tries to think
of ways he can make himself indispensable to his wife.Thus was born the knee capping incident which gained both Kerrigan and Harding a celebrity status far beyond the world of women's figure skating. It
was done by a man hired by a dim bulb friend of Gillooly's played by Paul Walker Houser. The scene with Houser being interviewed by the FBI is laughable and the expressions on the faces of the agents just says it all.The investigation went almost Watergate like up the ladder until the real target was reached by law enforcement and public opinion. It's such an incredibly plaintive scene as Harding begs the Figure Skating Association not to
be banned. It's all she knows. The film is purposely vague as to how much 
Tonya did know.Best of all is Allison Janney and while the cast is great and many might get
Oscar consideration Janney I think is a sure bet for a nomination as the monster of a mother that Robbie has. Still alive she denies the child abuse
allegations. I kind of doubt it. Janney is unforgettable.Two scenes are also real keys to Harding's character and how it developed. One is early on when Harding berates the judges. She knows she outskated
everyone, but they remind her that form and presentation count big for them.
And later on she's told she's not the right image. Figure skating champions have to be pristine princesses as they have from Sonja Henie to today. She
does make the effort to clean up her image.She almost does and a scene that will break your heart just before the fall is her leaving an arena and being asked by a little girl for an autograph. In that
moment with dignity and class she shows herself the role model sports figure
she was expected to be. Poignant all the more because the audience knows
the fall is coming.More than would be figure skaters should see I Tonya. It's the sad story of an
American tragedy.",9,1,2,13 January 2018
Dear John," In for the duration
","Channing Tatum and Amanda Seyfried star in a tender romantic story of a soldier on leave in South Carolina and a college student who have one of those once in a lifetime romantic affairs and who want to make it permanent. Tatum in fact is ready to leave the army once his enlistment is up, but the attacks on the Twin Towers and the Pentagon interrupt that. He and the rest of America go into a permanent state of war which sad to say we'll be in for the foreseeable future.Her main support in this world is Henry Thomas and his autistic son R. Braden Reed who ages into Luke Benward. One day while out with his unit on some unknown battlefield in the war on terror, Tatum gets that dreaded Dear John letter. Neither party though deeply in love is exactly truthful to the other. Tatum is not your average GI, he's in fact with Special Forces, otherwise known as a Green Beret. Patriotism is not something trotted out on the Fourth of July or other occasions. He may make the army a permanent profession.As for Seyfried her reasons for breaking off with Tatum border on the noble and self sacrificing. For that you see Dear John for, but I know in real life of a similar situation that Seyfried faces here.Also in the cast is Richard Jenkins who is Tatum's mildly autistic and eccentric father. His is a touching performance, the bond between him and Tatum runs very deep.Tatum and Seyfried are as romantic a couple as I've ever seen in the new century. If your taste in film runs to wartime romance this is definitely the film for you.",7,0,0,29 January 2015
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," 'You Keep Thinking Butch, That's What Your Good At'
","It's interesting that a film Midnight Cowboy about a street hustler managed to beat out a western about a couple of real western characters for Best Picture of 1969. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is simply one of the best westerns ever made, it's got wit, and charm, and will get you positively infectious in your enthusiasm for it.Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid has the incomparable team of Paul Newman and Robert Redford. George Roy Hill the director had a stroke of inspirational genius teaming the two of them. They both play a different character. Butch Cassidy is the amiable thinker and planner for the Hole in the Wall gang. Outlaw that he is Paul Newman is so charming in the role you have to root for him. He's a guy who thinks fast on his feet. Note what happens right at the beginning of the film when Ted Cassidy, best known for being Lurch the butler on the Addams Family challenges him for the gang leadership. It's one of my favorite scenes.But even better is Newman with George Furth as the dedicated employee of the Union Pacific Railroad in two scenes where this stubborn little clerk tries to singlehandedly stop the robbery. Furth in fact is my favorite character part in the film.Of course Newman is backed up by the laconic fast draw The Sundance Kid as played by Robert Redford. He's got a nice quiet menace about him, but you can tell how much affection he has for Newman. What comes through is these guys genuinely like each other on and off the screen.Katharine Ross plays Etta Place who was Sundance's mistress. I liked her also, she's a survivor and one grateful for the good and bad times she's had. Ross is a former schoolteacher and she went into the relationship with her eyes open with no regrets. But the most poignant moment in the film is when she tells both of the men that she'll go with them to Bolivia after the USA has gotten too hot for them and do whatever they want, but she won't watch them inevitably die because they can't change with the times.A lot of the same themes are expressed in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid as were done in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. The difference is that Butch and Sundance have a ton of redeeming qualities whereas Liberty Valance has none.B.J. Thomas's rendition of the Academy Award winning song Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head is what people remember most about this film. It's certainly one of the most recognized movie themes ever written. Besides Thomas, good records of the song were done by Andy Williams, Perry Como and Dean Martin. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid won some other technical Oscars including a most deserved one for cinematography. It missed being Best Picture and Best Director for George Roy Hill.In the only western he ever did in his career George Roy Hill came up with one of the best. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid should be seen back to back with The Sting. Hard to say which one is the better.",10,4,7,8 February 2008
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Going Toe to Toe with the 'Rooskies'
","As a film Dr. Strangelove was so well received that a more serious film on the same topic, Failsafe, failed to find an audience. Yet Strangelove made you think as well as entertain which is the ultimate object of any great work of cinema.General Jack D. Ripper has sent out the Strategic Air Command bombers and locked down Burpelson Air Force Base so that higher ups can't interfere. He's struck back at the dirty Communists for pushing fluoridation of the water supply which he feels has interfered with his bodily functions.Ripper might want to have checked with the Air Force Chief of Staff, General Buck Turgidson who when we meet him seems to have all his bodily functions working just fine. A second opinion on Ripper's lack of bodily functions might have revised his reason on why his particular functions weren't doing well.Of course his actions have created a crisis and President Muffley of the United States is busy trying to talk to Premier Kissoff of the USSR to prevent a nuclear war. That is in case those SAC bombers can't be recalled. One of the bombers commanded by Major Kong is anxious to do battle with the 'Rooskies'.Director Stanley Kubrick went poaching on the black comedy normally that would be the province of Billy Wilder. But even Wilder in his wildest dreams never used those wonderful Dickensian names for his characters that Kubrick is so delighting in. My favorite however is the part played by Keenan Wynn as the army colonel commanding the tactical force that liberates Burpelson, Colonel Bat Guano.Jack D. Ripper is played by Sterling Hayden a man consumed by his lack of bodily functions. This is a takeoff on Army General Edwin Walker who commanded US troops in Germany and was relieved when it was discovered he was indoctrinating his troops with John Birch Society propaganda which included their fears about fluoridation of water. Curiously enough that cause was actually taken up by other than fanatic right-wingers, people like Ralph Nader. Could Ripper have been right after all?George C. Scott is cigar chomping, bodily functioning spoof of legendary SAC commander Curtis LeMay. He's having quite the difficult time in deciding just who to root for in this crisis.Peter Sellers got an Oscar nomination for playing three different characters in Dr. Strangelove. Sellers is President Muttley, Colonel Mandrake of the RAF an exchange officer serving under Sterling Hayden and the crazed former Nazi nuclear scientist Dr. Strangelove. Watching the film, it's almost hard to believe this is the same man using three different voices and appearances that makeup alone could not explain. Sellers lost to his fellow British player Rex Harrison for My Fair Lady.In fact Dr. Strangelove also lost as Best Picture to My Fair Lady. Of course George Bernard Shaw never put his legendary wit to the issue of mutual nuclear annihilation. Neither did Billy Wilder, but I have a feeling those two talents together couldn't have done any better than Stanley Kubrick.The image that stays in your mind from the film I guarantee will be Slim Pickens as Major Kong riding that hydrogen bomb down to its 'Rooskie' target like a bucking bronco.Hopefully we won't meet Major Kong again, who knows where and who knows when.",9,4,8,6 April 2008
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," The Last Of The Force, I Doubt It
","About the only criticism I can make of Return Of The Jedi is that the film could easily have been two films. The story of Han Solo's rescue from Jabba The Hut and then the final confrontation with the Empire should have been two films. That would have been double the pleasure for fans of the series. As it stands now the folks there in that galaxy far away are in a happy ever after ending of their saga.The same old familiar faces from Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back are with us again. Harrison Ford was betrayed by Billy Dee Williams to the Empire who turned him over to Jabba, but the others affect an escape helped by the selfsame Billy Dee who did not like being reduced to a hireling in what was his former planet.Mark Hamill as the budding Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker learns the true nature of his existence and of the temptation to go over to the dark side of the Force. The path of light might be rougher, but it does not carry the same burdens. Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia finally chooses between Hamill and Harrison, although the script kind of makes the choice for her.George Lucas when he made additional films opted for the prequel showing how the situation came to be in the galaxy far away. He could still do a sequel, but unless he does this is it for the beloved characters of Star Wars.Return Of The Jedi got several Oscar nominations in technical categories all richly deserved. Something tells me we haven't seen the last of these people and the other creatures of their galaxy.",9,0,4,25 September 2010
The Book Thief," A little knowledge
","For those of us who remember the classic cinema MGM did a great anti- Nazi film in 1940, The Mortal Storm. One of the memorable scenes from the film was the book burning scene with young Dan Dailey intoning all the names of the authors the Third Reich was now banning. Nazi book burning is the theme for The Book Thief, that and one young girl's thirst for all this knowledge that the state says she must not have.Young Sophie Nelisse goes to live with foster parents Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson after her birth mother gives her away. It is mentioned that the birth parents were Communists and that their fate was not good once the Third Reich got established. At the book burning scene here which seems to have been modeled on the one from The Mortal Storm attendance in the town was required for the ceremony and as is true in every culture with the young, you say something is forbidden you know kids will want to try it. So Sophie's parents feel the same way and in the basement they have an illegal stash of forbidden authors. The one she first zeroes in on is H.G. Wells's The Invisible Man. No doubt why he's forbidden, Wells being the British Fabian Socialist he was.Sophie's parents also take in a young Jewish man who lives in their basement among the books. He's played by Ben Schnetzer and he and Nelisse form a bond with their thirst for knowledge, especially that which the state says they must not have.Binding this film is Roger Allam's narration as the character of Death whom he says all will eventually meet up with him. As you can gather several people do have an encounter.There are a couple of juvenile performances that are worthy of note. Nico Liersch is a kid next door who befriends Sophie and he's not quite buying into all the propaganda he's being fed. After seeing newsreels of the 1936 Olympics and seeing Jesse Owens, Liersch paints himself black and pretends to be the fastest man on earth.That brings him to the attention of Levin Liam who is the prototype of the Hitler Youth. It's funny how bullies seem to have a natural affinity for certain groups. Nazis certainly had their share of them, people whose need to bully others is now given an ideological base. I wish we'd have explored his character a bit more.The Book Thief is about ordinary people trying to live as best they can under adverse conditions, a state that stifles knowledge and the deprivations of war. The Book Thief shows as few other films I've seen that the thirst for a little knowledge will never be quenched.",9,1,3,26 April 2014
The Best Years of Our Lives," The People's War Veterans Return Home
","One of the great things about The Best Years of Our Lives that even though it dates itself rather firmly in the post World War II era, the issues it talks about are as real today as they were on V-E or V-J day of 1945. The problem of how to assimilate returning war veterans is as old as the written history of our planet.And while we don't often learn from history, we can be thankful that for once the United States of America did learn from what happened with its veterans after the previous World War. The GI Bill of Rights is mentioned in passing in The Best Years of Our Lives was possibly the greatest piece of social legislation from the last century. So many veterans did take advantage of it as do the veterans like Fredric March, Dana Andrews, and Harold Russell who you see here.All three of those actors played archetypal veterans, characters that every corner of the USA could identify with. They all meet on an army transport plane flying to the home town of all of them, Boone City, Iowa.War is a great leveler of class and distinction. Bank employee March, soda jerk Andrews, and high school football star Russell probably would never meet in real life even in a small town like Boone City. But they do meet and war forges indestructible bonds that can never be broken.March is the oldest, a man with two children and Hollywood's perfect wife Myrna Loy. He settles in the first and the best. He has some wonderful scenes, getting cockeyed drunk on his return and later with a little bit of liquor in him, tells the bank officials at a banquet off in no uncertain terms.I also love his scene where another returning veteran, a sharecropper wants to get a bank loan for his own piece of land. Watch March's expressions as he listens to the man's pitch for money. You can feel him read the man's soul. It's what got him his Second Best Actor Oscar for this film.Harold Russell was a real veteran who lost both his hands during service in the Pacific. He got a special recognition Oscar for his performance. Because of that it was probably unfair to nominate him in the Supporting Actor category which he also won in. His performance, especially his scenes with Cathy O'Donnell as his sweetheart who loves him with or without his hands, is beyond anything that could be described as acting.Dana Andrews is the only officer of the three, a bombardier in the Army Air Corps. Of the group of them, maybe he should have stayed in. He also comes from the poorest background of the group and he was an officer and a gentleman in that uniform. That uniform and those monthly allotment checks are what got Virginia Mayo interested enough to marry him. The problem is that he's considerably less in her eyes as a civilian.While Mayo is fooling around with Steve Cochran, Andrews has the great good fortune to have March's daughter Teresa Wright take an interest in him. They're the main story of the film, Andrews adjustment to civilian life and adjusting to the fact he married the wrong woman. Not all veteran's problems were solved with GI Bill.Myrna Loy gets little recognition for The Best Years of Our Lives. My guess is that it's because her role as wife was too much like the stereotypical wife roles she had patented over at MGM. Still as wife to March and mother to Wright she really is the glue that holds that family together.The Best Years of Our Lives won for Best Picture for Sam Goldwyn, Best Director for William Wyler and a few others besides the two acting Oscars it got. It was a critical and popular success, possibly the best film Sam Goldwyn ever produced. It remains to this day an endearing and enduring classic and will be so for centuries. It's almost three hours in length, but never once will your interest wane.The best tribute this film received came from Frank Capra who had a film of his own in the Oscar sweepstakes that year in several categories. In his memoirs he said that he was disappointed to be skunked at the Oscars that year, but that his friend and colleague William Wyler had created such a masterpiece he deserved every award he could get for it.By the way, the film Capra had hopes for was It's A Wonderful Life. The Beat Years of Our Lives can't get better praise than that.",10,78,85,23 April 2007
The Town," Robbing A Shrine
","In The Town Ben Affleck got to do another big screen tribute to his home town of Boston and even better got to shoot a good deal of this film at his beloved Fenway Park. Directing, writing, and starring in The Town who could ask for more except to shoot the film in places that I'm sure meant a good deal to him personally.But The Town isn't some hazy nostalgic type movie, not by any means. It's a hard hitting crime drama about the lives of a heist crew and what it took for the FBI to bring them down.The Town is brutally realistic in its depiction of these robbers who grew up in the tough neighborhood of Charlestown where people enter the trade of thievery from generation to generation. Ben Affleck is such a person whose father Chris Cooper is currently doing a life sentence for a robbery that was planned by neighborhood crime boss Pete Postlethewaite from his florist shop. Pete's character must have been steeped in crime lore and took as his model that other noted florist of Irish descent who also ran a crime organization, Dion O'Bannion.At their latest robbery where the crew is completely masked, a hostage they took and released after safely getting away was seen talking to the FBI in the person of agent Jon Hamm who has made it his life's crusade to take this bunch down. They took her driver's license and note that Rebecca Hall is from The Town. Just to make sure she isn't telling anything that could lead to their arrest, Affleck arranges an accidental meeting with Hall. Even though he's already involved with Blake Lively sister of friend Jeremy Renner and fellow crew member, Affleck and Hall start getting involved to the surprise of Affleck.The Town as elements of classic films like White Heat and The Asphalt Jungle and what I like about it is like The Asphalt Jungle, director Affleck got some well rounded, three dimensional portraits of his characters without sacrificing either suspense or action. Jeremy Renner who is up for Best Supporting Actor is great as the best friend and fellow crew member who is determined not to go back to prison for life as he's already a two time loser. Postlethwaite is as lethal as Dion O'Bannion was and in his own scene with Affleck visiting him in prison Chris Cooper is unforgettable. Cooper is one of the best actors we have currently, I've never seen him bad in anything he does and The Town is no exception.The climax involved the gang pulling a heist on that noted Boston shrine Fenway Park. That's almost sacrilege in Boston, but this is one nervy crew of professionals. And the FBI is not stupid either. The climax should satisfy any action fan.I really recommend seeing The Town which is a film that succeeds on numerous levels and can be enjoyed by all kinds of film fans with all kinds of taste.",8,1,4,12 February 2011
Shutter Island," Mind Games
","Shutter Island is a body of land in Boston Harbor which has a hospital for the criminally insane. It's run by a pair of doctors played by Ben Kingsley and Max Von Sydow who have certainly essayed roles of some very deep villainy. Couple that with the fact that this film is set in post World War II where America has just been fighting with people who have mysterious accents like Von Sydow and Kingsley. It's a recipe for a Hitchcock like thriller.US Marshal Leonardo DiCaprio has been sent to Shutter Island with his new partner Mark Ruffalo to investigate the disappearance of a woman who was declared criminally insane by the courts and is now confined to the island facility. Though it is a hospital also, primarily Shutter Island is a prison and run by the Federal government and subject to their jurisdiction. Although Ruffalo is content to follow DiCaprio's lead, Leo's not happy with the lack of cooperation he's getting on the investigation, even more unhappy that inclement weather is forcing he and Ruffalo to stay on the island. Something suspicious is going on and DiCaprio's going to get to the bottom of it.Actually something very suspicious is going on there, some very intricate mind games are being played, some experimentation is being conducted by the staff. But trust me, it's beyond DiCaprio's powers of grasp.Shutter Island marks the third film that Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio have teamed as director/star. It's possible Leo is trying to tie Robert DeNiro for times working with Scorsese. This part is certainly one a younger DeNiro might have done. I don't think Shutter Island ranks up there with either The Aviator or The Departed it's still an intricately plotted story and one where the lead has to be convincing or the film goes nowhere. DiCaprio doggedly plods on with his investigation while battling some inner demons that the audience is gradually let it on. A younger DeNiro couldn't have been better.The rest of the cast ably supports Leo, but in the final analysis Shutter Island belongs to him and to Martin Scorsese for putting it all together. Alfred Hitchcock would be proud.",7,5,12,13 March 2010
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Security over liberty, what the bad guys count on
","Chris Evans who seems to be making a career out of playing superheroes comes back as Steve Rogers AKA Captain America. He meets an old friend from the past in not the best of circumstances in Captain America: The Winter Soldier.The film begins simply enough as the Captain America team rescues some hijacked people on a ship at sea. But some other people on the team have some additional duties involving securing intelligence, a part of the mission that Evans is not told about. Things get dicey when his mentor and supervisor Samuel L. Jackson is shot and killed and Evans becomes a wanted man. But being Captain America, he's not such an easy guy to take down.In the end we're told it's a new world order being brought about by people who are thinking that people will beg for security with all the terror around them in this day and age. American establishmentarian figure Robert Redford goes against his all American hero type image to play the evil genius behind all this dirty work. Redford who probably came closest to a villain role before in Indecent Proposal looks like he's thoroughly enjoying himself as a bad guy.I have to say I've enjoyed Chris Evans as both Captain America and Johnny Storm the Human Torch. It's sad in this day and age that real heroes are to be found in comic books as source material for films. Back in Hollywood's golden age Evans would have been a great cowboy hero.Those who love Marvel comics will go for Captain America: The Winter Soldier in a big way. And some of us who never pick up comic books will enjoy it too.",7,0,4,4 April 2014
Capote," Philip Seymour Capote
","I finally got to see the Best Actor performance of Philip Seymour Hoffman as the late writer and icon Truman Capote. It's based on the biography published in the Eighties entitled Capote by Gerald Clarke.The only part of the book the film deals with is the creation and completion of Capote's landmark docunovel In Cold Blood. And the film is remarkably faithful to the details described in the book. In 1959 in his Brooklyn Heights apartment, Truman Capote read about the slaying of a Kansas family named Clutter in some small town called Holcomb. He decides to go west and investigate every aspect of this gruesome tragedy. That includes numerous interviews with both the suspects that are eventually caught, tried, and convicted.With one of them, Perry Smith, Capote forms a strange relationship as he tries to get the real story about what happened in that Kansas farm house that night in 1959 by the only two left who can tell it. And Smith who is flattered by all the attention this celebrity is giving him. It's sad, but Perry Smith becomes almost a celebrity by reflection at a time when he's facing execution. Clifton Collins, Jr. plays Smith and it's a subtle piece of acting he does. We see a lost little boy in those scenes with Capote in prison, but we also never forget this man is a stone cold killer who went to this farm house in the mistaken belief that Mr. Clutter had squirreled away a large sum of cash because he didn't trust banks. Not as foolish as you might think. In the generation before during the Depression when banks did fail, a lot of people lost their faith in financial institutions. In fact an uncle and aunt of mine had that happen to them before they passed on the last decade.But the film belongs to Philip Seymour Hoffman. I first saw Hoffman on screen playing Scotty G in Boogie Nights. It was also a gay character, but light years from the sophisticated and glamorous Truman Capote. Scotty G was the backward kid who crushes out big time on Mark Wahlberg in Boogie Nights. Hoffman is an player of extraordinary range to successfully essay both Capote and Scotty G.This was an extraordinary year in the Academy Awards with nominations going to performers who played real life people. Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny Cash, George Clooney as Edward R. Murrow, and Philip Seymour Hoffman as Truman Capote. And every one of them gave a performance that made me think I was seeing old film clips of their characters.I recommend the film. As a story it can stand on its own. But I also recommend highly the book by Gerald Clarke. For those of you liked the film and like Philip Seymour Hoffman in the part, the biography Capote is a fascinating read, a glimpse into gay America, both pre and post the Stonewall Riots. And it's a good social history of the times.",9,4,5,19 March 2006
Life of Pi," An Amazing Adventure
","With four people bringing the life of Pi Patel to the big screen, no wonder no Oscars were given out in the Best Acting category. All four seem to function as a unit as the oldest one tells the story of an amazing adventure to a writer who has been told that Pi has an incredible tale to tell. The lack nominations in the acting categories is made up by the four Oscars Life Of Pi won this past year in the technical categories. The computer graphics are something else.Like Gloria Stuart retelling her life as a Titanic survivor and the audience seeing Kate Winslet playing it out on the big screen, Irrfan Khan recounts his surviving a shipwreck where he and his family are taking a bunch of zoo animals from India to Canada where the Japanese freighter they're on is sunk with all hands lost.Young Suraj Sharma manages to swim to a floating and empty lifeboat which turns out not to be so empty as a few of the zoo animals also make it there. Including a young and hungry Bengal Tiger cub who is very hungry. I won't say more because at this point the computer graphic special effects takes over. Some miracles are provided, but maybe the biggest miracle of all is that the tiger and Pi decide they really do need each other. Pi who checked out all forms of religious beliefs calls on all the Deities he's learned on for help. The biggest help granted is if not a change of nature, a curbing of the carnivorous nature of the tiger to save the Life Of Pi.I was kind of lost at the message part, just what director Ang Lee was saying about nature and nature's God to use Jefferson's phrase. But the technical achievements of the film truly do dwarf whatever message that was being told about life. Those achievements have vaulted Life Of Pi to the top of the cinematic world and it's likely to remain there.",8,2,5,13 April 2013
Doctor Strange," The Doctor Is In
","One of Marvel Comics great superheroes finally gets his turn at screen immortality. Doctor Strange who has a manner similar to the TV doctor named House is a rather self satisfied and smug individual. He's a genius and he makes sure everyone knows it. But one night he's involved in a serious automobile crash and his physical body fails to heal entirely. He's left with a palsy that makes being a surgeon out of the question unless you mean tree surgery.Benedict Cumberbatch plays Doctor John Strange and like Tyrone Power in The Razor's Edge he goes to the mystic east to find healing with the Ancient One, a gender bending guru played by Tilda Swinton. He learns a lot about the metaphysical nature of the earth and how worlds co- exist in the same space and how some chosen few like he's been chosen are guarding the portals between those worlds. When those worlds are open it can get real messy.There are times where the plot gets a bit vague and I guess you have to have been a Marvel Comics fanatic in order to get a lot of the subtleties in the story. Something I do not claim to be.Doctor Strange did get an Oscar nomination for Visual Effects and we'll no doubt see a sequel if the demand is there and the money is right.",6,1,2,13 August 2017
We Are Marshall," 'They Don't Know Your Heart'
","Forget the PG rating because some bad words are spoken. This film is one to take the family to. I have to say I was most inspired by the story of a whole university community coming together in the wake of a mind numbing tragedy.On November 14, 1970 the chartered plane carrying the football team of Marshall University, together with a whole lot of alumni boosters and prominent citizens of Huntington, West Virginia crashed killing the 75 or so people on board. We Are Marshall is the story of how the community and the college found the strength to rebound.The thing that impressed me the most was how a whole lot of ordinarily disinterested people helped out in the situation. The NCAA is an organization normally criticized for hidebound interpretation of arcane rules. Nevertheless they enabled Marshall University to field a team by granting an exception and allowing them to play freshmen on the varsity squad for the 1971 season.During the course of the film it's mentioned in passing that Bear Bryant tells the new Marshall football coach Jack Lengyel about a running back he ought to look at. A small, but telling tribute to a college football legend himself who just as easily could have signed that prospect for his own Crimson Tide.In fact my favorite moment is when Matthew McConaughey and Matthew Fox go to the University of West Virginia to view some football films for some play ideas for the new squad they're putting together. The coach let's them view them even though he's giving away some of his bag of tricks. At one point two of the West Virginia players come into the room and on their helmets is a tribute to the late Marshall team. Very understatedly moving indeed.Matthew McConaughey plays Jack Lengyel who takes on the Herculean challenge of putting together a team for the next season. He cobbles it together from all kinds of sources, Bear Bryant being one of them. If I was a college jock, McConaughey's the kind of coach I'd hope to be playing for. I'm sure McConaughey's own football background didn't hurt with this performance.Other performances to watch are Matthew Fox as the surviving assistant coach who did not make the fatal trip, David Strathairn as the Marshall University president who's not a sports fan, but instinctively knows how important it is to carry on and most importantly Anthony Mackie. Mackie is one of the original varsity squad who did not make the fatal trip because of injuries and starts the 1971 season still not 100%. Mackie becomes the prime mover in rallying the school to demand of the board of trustees that football continue. We Are Marshall transcends just being a sports film. It's one of the best of that genre ever made. But it's a story about the will to carry on even after life deals you a below the belt blow. As such you don't have to be a college football fan to appreciate how the town of Huntington, West Virginia and Marshall University showed their heart and spirit.",10,10,13,28 December 2006
Barry Lyndon," Irish social climber
","Acclaimed by many as Stanley Kubrick's finest, I think Barry Lyndon is a good film that misses being a great one due to some truly bad casting. I can only imagine such folks as Peter O'Toole, Richard Harris, and Albert Finney were off doing other projects that Ryan O'Neal was selected for the title role. Try as he might O'Neal is just way too American to fit the part of an 18th century Irishman who wishes to rise in society and not care how he does it.I have to say that Kubrick's recreation of the 18th century in both its look and mores is nothing short of magnificent. Small wonder that Barry Lyndon won Oscars for Costume Design, Best Music Score, Cinematography and Art&Set Design. The technical aspect he nailed down beautifully.As for O'Neal in 18th century Ireland and assuming he's a Protestant there are still limited means of opportunity. Seduced by Gay Hamilton his first love, she abandons him for marriage to a wealthy British officer. And when O'Neal refuses to leave she and her family play a very interesting trick which I won't reveal to force him to leave.After time in both the British and Prussian armies during the Seven Years War and some lucrative years at the gaming tables, O'Neal has his turn at seduction when he beds Marisa Berenson while she's still married to the titled Frank Middlemass. Then he dies and O'Neal weds her and her money, but earns the undying enmity of her son Leon Vitali. That in fact seals his fate.O'Neal and Berenson do have a child of their own and seeing the scenes between O'Neal and his own son made me think that Thackerey's treatment of the father/son relationship was the model for what Margaret Mitchell did with Rhett Butler and Bonnie Blue Butler in Gone With The Wind.Kubrick opted for a full treatment of Thackerey's novel just as David O. Selznick did with Gone With The Wind. Unfortunately Ryan O'Neal just did not fit the title role as Clark Gable did with Rhett Butler.",7,1,5,21 December 2013
Full Metal Jacket," The making of marines
","Thirty years after Stanley Kubrick did Paths Of Glory about the futility of World War I Kubrick did Full Metal Jacket about the American experience in Vietnam. The wars were incredibly different and the French were fighting on their own soil, still the frustration of war and the stupidity of the high command make these films markedly similar.Another Vietnam classic came out around the same time Casualties Of War and that dealt with the army. A very different experience to be sure because the army contained draftees and folks in the National Guard and Army Reserve who LBJ did not call up for Vietnam. Hence it was a haven for those of us not quite ready to give up our young lives. It was sure different from the training these guys were getting on Parris Island. In fact many was a night I comforted myself with the thought about what the marines were like.Matthew Modine plays the lead here, a fellow who goes through the training and then is assigned as a journalist to Stars And Stripes. He is the voice of screenwriter and novelist Guy Hasford whose book Full Metal Jacket is based.Today we are in open ended war in the Middle East started to be sure by an attack on our native soil. But we got sidetracked by some old fashioned imperialist objectives in Iraq and now we've got ISIS to contend with. What should our response be? Certainly it has to be a multi-faceted one, it can't all be about dropping bombs on people different from us. It's like we learned nothing from Casualties Of War or Full Metal Jacket.I think if the film has a weakness it's that the training portion of Full Metal Jacket is better than the combat one. That is because of the performances of R. Lee Ermey as the redneck gunnery sergeant and Vincent D'Onofrio as the poor fat slob of a recruit.I cannot emphasize too much that D'Onofrio, Modine, and the rest are all volunteers. That being said I'm at a loss to explain why wasn't D'Onofrio just not washed out. Ermey if he was doing his job properly would have. But he was having too much sadistic fun.That being said when D'Onofrio prepared for the part no doubt he created a back story as to how his character came to Parris Island. I would love to ask D'Onofrio how that came to be.Full Metal Jacket is an enduring war classic and will be shown right along with Paths Of Glory as long as we have means to entertain and educate ourselves.",9,0,1,14 July 2015
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Inconsolable grief
","It's ironic that the first of Frances McDormand's Oscars came for her portrayal of a
sheriff in Fargo. For her second one she plays the antagonist to a sheriff she
feels isn't doing her job. The sheriff is a most popular individual in the town,
Woody Harrelson. But this is a woman with a mission.None of the people in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri are of any kind of
heroic stature. They're just I suspect as ordinary as any of us with our good points and bad. One of them, Deputy Sam Rockwell is one unapologetic
racist who uses his badge to harass and assault folks of a different skin tone.
He's McDormand's greatest antagonist and in the end the two come to an 
interesting relationship.McDormand is a mother who just can't accept the loss of her daughter. I'm the
son of one who never got over the loss of her daughter. But my sister died of
natural causes, McDormand's teen daughter went out one night against parental advice and was raped and murdered.That was months ago and there's no accepting her loss for McDormand. She
got her Best Actress Oscar not just for words spoken, but for some incredible
body language and facial expressions. Her rage at what she sees is the lack of
interest by law enforcement will not be abated.So what she has done is out of whatever money she has scraped up together is
pay for three large billboards outside the main thoroughfare of the town of
Ebbing, Missouri calling attention to the lack of progress on her daugher's
homicide and getting personal with Chief Woody Harrelson. Harrelson in turn
has some personal problems of a serious nature which the town knows about
and the sympathy that McDormand might have had is turning to resentment 
toward her.Her grief isn't the only thing that has turned McDormand into the unpleasant
creature she is. Her husband John Hawkes who seems to be no great prize
himself left her for a 19 year old chippie. Her son Lucas Hedges is also feeling
alienated from both parents.There's no such place as Ebbing, Missouri but the uniformly fine ensemble of
players sure makes you think you're in mid country America looking in on a place that's a cross between Grover's Corner in Our Town and Winesburg, Ohio
in the 21st century. Of course the cast is topped by Oscar winners Frances McDormand for Best Actress and Sam Rockwell for Best Supporting Actor.
Woody Harrelson also got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor
and the film was nominated in a bunch of other categories including Best
Picture.See this one by all means.",9,1,4,19 April 2018
The Grapes of Wrath," Economic Dislocation
","John Ford's film of John Steinbeck's novel has deservedly a classic film mirroring the views of both men and the times the book was written and filmed. Ford won his second Oscar for Best Director and Jane Darwell was the Best Supporting Actress of 1940.For most of America the Depression started with the stock market crash of 1929. But for the farmers it really began at the end of World War I. Those were good years for agriculture, the war in Europe was a boom for agriculture. But when farm prices dropped after the Armistice, a whole lot of family farms went belly up. Lots of people left the farms for the big city and industry jobs. The Depression years unhappily coincided with some of the worst drought ever seen in America.This is what many families like the Joads were facing in 1939 when the book was written. The banks had foreclosed on land that had withered to dust in any event. Folks like the Joads picked up and moved elsewhere, like California on a rumor of prosperity and jobs. America was still changing from an agricultural to an industrial society back then. That causes a lot of trouble for people unskilled in any industrial job training. As a country we're going through something similar today in many areas. We're moving from an industrial to an information based economy. Industry jobs are being lost to other nations and older and poorer workers are suffering for it. It's progress I guess, but it takes its toll.Some factory worker who has lost his job for any number of reasons can identify to some degree with the Joads, especially if they've lost a home they owned. For the Joads it was worse because they made their living off the land for many generations, identifying with it in a way that industrial workers could not.Henry Fonda got his first Oscar nomination for Tom Joad. To get the part which he knew he was so right for, he signed a studio contract with 20th Century Fox. That caused him many problems later on, but those are stories for another film review. Tom Joad is a midwest country kid, a whole lot like Fonda himself. Part of the story of The Grapes of Wrath is Tom himself trying to figure out why these economic forces are crushing him and his family and the way of life he's known. In the end when he leaves the Joad family and hits the open road, he's not got all the answers, but he's asking the questions. Tom hasn't figured it out, but a lot of people with many letters after their names haven't either. He only knows that he's got to get in the fight for economic justice.Jane Darwell was in films from the earliest silent films to Mary Poppins in 1965. This became her career part and the mother role of all time. She's what holds the Joad family together in good times and bad. That's what moms do and get little recognition for it. Except in this case by the Motion Picture Academy.John Carradine has his career part in this also. Another John Ford favorite, Carradine plays Casy the defrocked preacher who as he tells it disgraced himself with a female parishioner. After that preaching the gospel didn't seem quite right. When Fonda meets Carradine after Fonda's been released from prison, Carradine is asking a lot of questions about what is man's place in the metaphysical scheme of things. He's developing what we would now call situational ethics. Carradine's questions are on a higher plane, but he certainly inspires Fonda to ask for some answers himself.The Grapes of Wrath illustrates that at least government can give first aid in a crisis. After being in privately run agricultural camps where they're treated like less than dirt, the Joads happen upon a camp run by the Department of Agriculture where at least they're treated like humans. As it turns out, the Secretary of Agriculture was one Henry A. Wallace who was running for Vice President that year with Franklin D. Roosevelt. I'll bet any number of people saw The Grapes of Wrath and saw a message of support for FDR and the New Deal.Given some of the problems of the American economy today, The Grapes of Wrath though it appears dated isn't really all that much a relic of our past. It's both a timeless book and a timeless classic film.",10,76,89,1 October 2006
Empire of the Sun," A great adventure for a child
","I can see that a tale told from a child's point of view how it would stir the imagination of one Steven Spielberg. Empire Of The Sun is a really imaginative story of a young boy stuck in World War II China in a truly terrible situation cut off from his parents. Yet young Christian Bale turns the whole thing gradually into an adventure of sorts. Up to the age of 11 young Bale has lived in the British quarter of Shanghai and in fact has never seen the United Kingdom, his father Rupert Frazer owns a textile factory. Bale and his parents live in luxury among the millions of Chinese.What one should remember when watching Empire Of The Sun is that since the Opium War of 1841 western powers and Japan joined them took small little nibbles out of China and in fact were granted by the weak Chinese governments special treatment in their quarters. Frazer, Emily Richard his wife and young Bale lived under British law and did not answer to the Chinese. The other powers did the same, even the USA had its own quarter in Shanghai as well as other large Chinese cities. That only ended with the Communist takeover in 1949.It ended a bit prematurely for the west in 1941 when the Japanese attacked America, Great Britain, the Netherlands. That's when Bale's well ordered world falls apart.I had to marvel at how when Bale came home and the parents were gone and some looting had occurred how his reactions were. Without any dialog Bale runs through a gamut of emotions. Great job of acting and directing.Later on Bale is rounded up and taken to an internment camp next to an airfield. Fascinating how Bale who had an interest in aviation looks at the Japanese planes and become almost worshipful of the enemy. He even makes friend with some of the Japanese, a group not known for treating prisoners well in World War II.Joe Pantoliano and John Malkovich are a pair of American adventurers, no better than they ought to be. They're caught along with Bale and sent to the internment camp. Our adult eyes see them as a pair of bottom feeders. But we see them through the child's eyes also and they become sort of devil may care rogues that one reads in pulp fiction the kind Bale no doubt read. Steven Spielberg did a marvelous job of recreating wartime China and it certainly helped to shoot the film there. Just part of the People's Republic's post Mao entry into the community of nations.The adult performers are fine. Empire Of The Sun got a flock of Oscar nominations in technical categories, no gold though. But it did inaugurate the career of Christian Bale who's done pretty well for himself as an adult actor too.This one is highly recommended for its realism and encouragement of imagination.",8,15,25,21 November 2016
American Sniper," The Most lethally effective sniper the USA ever trained.
","Although American Sniper did take one Oscar home for Best Sound Editing, it is Bradley Cooper's performance as Chris Kyle, the Audie Murphy of the Iraq War.I say that because after reading Tony Curtis's memoirs where he tells of working with Murphy when they were both young contract players at Universal-International, Cooper's performance really resonated with me. To say the Iraq war of intervention is controversial is putting it mildly. Murphy's war by the history written was a 'good' war where all who served were somehow heroes. Murphy the most decorated soldier in our history was described by Curtis as suffering post traumatic stress similar to what Cooper shows us in Kyle. Curtis recalls that he and others gave Audie a wide berth at Universal, never knowing when a hair trigger temper would go off.Still Murphy left the war behind other than doing a war picture or three in Hollywood. By contrast Kyle never left his war behind with four different duties in Iraq. His skills were essential, the most lethally effective sniper our Armed Forces ever produced. Seeing what we see in American Sniper will make no one a cheerleader for the Iraq War. It certainly unnerved Chris Kyle. His lifeline to a normal existence turns out to be his wife Sienna Miller and his family. Far more than in a marriage to a civilian or even with most military marriages. Without Taya Kyle, Chris Kyle would truly have been a lost soul.The war is realistically depicted by director Clint Eastwood. Eastwood unlike John Wayne with The Green Berets had the good sense not to make a World War II film for this conflict. Which with Isis now on the scene may still not be over.I recommend seeing American Sniper for the strength of Bradley Cooper's performance and the overall ensemble performances of the cast. It is so far the best depiction of the Iraq War on screen.",8,6,9,6 July 2015
Glory," For Freedom
","Glory is the story of the men and commander of the 54th Massachusetts, the first black regiment organized after the Emancipation Proclamation culminating in its first full scale military engagement at Fort Wagner in South Carolina. In command of the regiment was Robert Gould Shaw, a colonel at the ripe old age of 26 of the Boston Goulds and Shaws.Played by Matthew Broderick in what could be his career role on screen, Shaw's character serves as narrator of the events. He was quite the letter writer and his correspondence to his parents and friends in the Boston area have been considered a valuable piece of original historical material and are preserved at the Harvard Library.Shaw was a fervent believer in not only the abolitionist cause, but a firm believer in racial equality, many were not even in the army that was fighting for slave freedom after the Emancipation Proclamation. He fought hard for his troops, for their rations and supplies, against quartermasters who thought it was a fun thing to short change them.His good friend from the same Boston crowd Shaw came from was his second in command, Cabot Forbes played by Cary Elwes. They've got their differences as well, but both are committed to a cause.Shaw's black regiment comes in all shapes and sizes as well. Denzel Washington won his first Academy Award as a rather undisciplined soldier who eventually proves his worth on the battle field. Morgan Freeman is an older man who rapidly rises to leadership ranks because of his concern for the unit as a whole. My favorite performance in the film however is that of Andre Braugher. He plays a free black man from Massachusetts who grew up with Shaw and can read and write, a rare thing for black Americans free or slave in Civil War era America. In the south it was a crime to educate slaves beyond what they needed to know to perform their labors. He comes from a different perspective than the runaway slaves have and he's not at first accepted as a comrade among them, especially by Washington. Braugher shows he has the right stuff though and he should have been recognized with an Oscar nomination in my humble opinion.In addition to Denzel Washington's Oscar, Glory took home gold for Sound and for Cinematography in 1989 and was nominated for Editing and for Art&Set Direction. The film has the look and feel of the Civil War era about it. It took a long time for the heroic story of the 54th Massachusetts and its leader to come to the screen. Both are shown to have had the right stuff. The tens of thousands who died in the Civil War and those for whom the war was all about and died at Fort Wagner gave what Lincoln called, 'the last full measure of devotion'. And this film is a tribute to them.",10,2,5,21 February 2009
The Devil Wears Prada," Budding fashionista
","The Devil Wears Prada finds an eager young journalism major Anne Hathaway
starting a new job at the fashion industry magazine Runway. She's got the
writing credentials, but experience in the industry not a bit. Which is going
to be tough because she will be working for Meryl Streep a queenpin of the
fashion industry. She's a tough and exacting and demanding supervisor and
can't seem to keep good help.Watching Streep as Miranda Priestley I was reminded about how law clerks
worked that way for William O. Douglas on the Supreme Court. He went through them like tissue paper he was that demanding. A brilliant jurist not a
very nice man.Anne Hathaway ever since she was a Disney princess seems always to be cast
as sunny, upbeat characters and the casting suits her well. Streep really puts
her through the ringer. But the girl had grit.Streep's a survivor, she's tough in a tough business. One wonders when she was up and coming herself what she might have gone through that make her
the way she is.Hathaway's also got relationship problems with her boyfriend Adrian Greiner who is trying to make it in another tough business, cooking. Hathaway temporarily falls for the charming fashion designer Simon Baker on a quick
trip to Paris with Streep.The Devil Wears Prada got two Oscar nominations, one of the many for Meryl
Streep as Best Actress and one for costume design. As this is a film about the
fashion industry that would almost seem a requirement. Fans of Meryl Streep will enjoy this one. You might try viewing this back to
back with the Susan Hayward classic I Can Get It For You Wholesale. That
film will give you an idea where Streep might have originated from.",7,1,2,26 March 2018
Forrest Gump," The Hand Of An Unseen Providence
","When Tom Hanks won his first Oscar for Philadelphia in 1993 the film received a total of five nominations. His second Oscar for Forrest Gump came in a film that received more than double that in nominations and awards. If Forrest Gump did nothing else it solidified Hanks's credentials as a serious actor. He would never be doing imitations of his Bosom Buddies character in films again.It also among other awards also won for Best Picture and Best director for Robert Zemeckis, richly deserved. The film is Huckleberry Finn like in its canny observations coming from the man who had an IQ we are told of 75. But as Forrest also tells us, 'stupid is as stupid does'. And Forrest with the hand of an unseen providence comes out a lot better than some of the clever people he meets in life.Watching the film once again it occurred to me that Mark Twain if he couldn't have written this himself would have loved the way Zemeckis handled the character of Forrest Gump. The beauty of Huckleberry Finn and the secret of its success is that Twain got into the mind of a child who recorded all the events around him, a child without too much education. What Zemeckis did was get Hanks into a child like mind who sees things with amazing clarity stripped of any veneer of pretense. Which Hanks observes in the people around him and in the events that shape America and himself from Eisenhower to Reagan.There are two prominent female parts in Forrest Gump. One is for Robin Wright who plays the abused child Julie as an adult. She is Forrest's love and best friend and she takes a different path of life one she chose with more deliberation than Hanks. Their fates though eventually entwined are radically different. The second major female role is for another two time Oscar winner Sally Field who now is playing matronly parts, a far cry from Gidget and the Flying Nun. She gives Forrest the maxims he lives by and in a crisis they turn out to be more than sound bite clich√©s.Another award that Forrest Gump won is for Special Effects and an award it didn't win was for Gary Sinise in the role of Lieutenant Dan Taylor, Forrest's commanding officer in Vietnam. That's something that does not compute because the special effects were to show Gary Sinise as a double amputee with both legs lost in Vietnam.It's some amazing bit of work no doubt about it, but to honor it without Sinise whose performance really brings it off is ridiculous. Sinise is the educated one who curses the fate that happened to him, but in the end by just going with the flow he does prosper in the end. Sinise lost that year in Best Supporting Actor category to Martin Landau for Ed Wood, but I think Sinise's performance has had a more lasting impact.To those Americans who serve our country it certainly has. Gary Sinise has devoted a great deal of his life and earned treasure to bring entertainment to our overseas troops in Iraq, Afghanistan, wherever, becoming a successor to Bob Hope in that regard. He's gone further than that though, setting up foundations to help civilians in both countries and contributing to numerous charities dealing with war and its aftermath. Doing that in my humble opinion Gary Sinise has become one of the great Americans of our brand new millenia, a lot more than just an actor. He's forever now known as Lieutenant Dan.In the end though the film belongs to Tom Hanks who joined with Spencer Tracy as the only two male actors to win back to back Oscars for Best Actor. Hanks fascinates us and guides us through this film and when we're done we've seen something very special.If you don't believe me about how good Forrest Gump is, then watch it for a few minutes and see if you're not sucked in. Like Forrest's mama says, the film's like life which is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you'll get until you open it.'",10,11,19,13 February 2010
The Passion of Joan of Arc," That Male Attire
","For those who have seen Ingrid Bergman and later on Jean Seberg play the maid of Orleans in other interpretations of the Joan Of Arc story you might well do to take a look at what the French themselves have with their national heroine. The Passion Of Joan Of Arc made at the tail end of silent films give an actress normally associated with comedy a chance to give an astonishing interpretation of the maid. It also gives us the only recorded performance of Maria Falconetti to treasure.Directed and written by Carl Dreyer, the sets are a bare basic item in this film, there only to establish a time and place. We see none of Joan's deeds of heroism, this film only concerns us with her trial and execution. And in an interesting and successful technique the entire film is told in closeups, more closeups than I've ever seen used before in any film. As she's interrogated by the Bishop of Cauchon who was in the pay of England's ally the Duke of Burgundy. The film cuts back and forth to closeup shots of the interrogators and then to Falconetti. Her expressions and her tears even without dialog create the image of the frightened and pure saint like girl just trying to do the right thing and stand by her conviction that she's been singled out to save France.At least to my eye Falconetti bore more than a slight resemblance to Anna Magnani and I'm betting if talkies had been available she would have sounded like her as well.There have been modern interpretations that Joan Of Arc might well have been a lesbian. What was really bothering her accusers was the fact that she was in male attire. Now leaving the question of sexual orientation aside, even if all that Joan was, was a symbol just getting around a battlefield might require the clothing that a soldier might wear. It wouldn't be practical to be wearing a farm dress. And certainly if one was participating in the battle it would be foolish.But the male attire seemed to be what got the accusers going. They harped on it constantly during the interrogation. If this was proof that the Maid was a lesbian, than surely she was in league with satanic forces.Depending on your point of view it could range from Joan actually hearing the voice of God to some hallucinatory ramblings from some kind of native intoxicant. Whatever it was she was convinced they came from heaven and more importantly she convinced others. It's why she remains France's national heroine and why she's such a challenging role for so many actresses. Maybe Meryl Streep will try that one next.Until then Maria Falconetti takes her place alongside Ingrid Bergman and Jean Seberg. Watch them all and compare.",9,3,7,5 April 2010
The Lost City of Z," Percy Fawcett 1867-1925?
","No doubt that Percy Fawcett has shuffled off this mortal coil in at least the year 1925. The British explorer and his son vanished in the deep Amazon jungle in that year on a quest to find Fawcett's fabled Lost City Of Z(ed)which is how they would say it across the pond. His quest proved to be his undoing. He was convinced that evidence of this city showing a high civilization deep in the tributary country that make up the Amazon. Quests for lost cities did in Spanish conquistadors like Hernando DeSoto. Coronado looked for his 7 cities of gold in the American southwest and Ponce DeLeon died in Florida looking for the Fountain Of Youth.Seeing the story of the real Fawcett makes me think he was the inspiration for Arthur Conan Doyle's George Challenger and those stories regarding the Lost World he sought in the same area.Fawcett had a home and hearth as well. Sienna Miller plays his wife and Robert Pattinson of the Twilight series plays his son in his last years. Fawcett is played by Charles Hunnam and all distinguish themselves in their performances. Fawcett's domestic life was hardly serene as his wife wished he'd be home more instead of weeks and months at a time when he would leave her with yet another mouth to feed.Like Francois Villon, Jean Lafitte, and Amelia Earhart whose last days are unknown and open to speculation, Fawcett's have also been ripe with argument. The scenes here with Hunnam and Pattinson resolved to meet whatever fate awaits them with the Amazon tribes they encountered are beautifully played and sure to illicit an emotional response.The cinematography is stunning, it looks a lot like the Scorsese film The Mission. The cast is perfect and the film is quite the tribute to one intrepid explorer.",8,6,9,16 July 2017
Southpaw," Hope springs eternal
","Jake Gyllenhaal gives his fans his best work since Brokeback Mountain as light heavyweight champion Billy Hope who suffers a horrific personal tragedy beyond any I've ever seen in a boxing film and comes back from it. For what he goes through Sylvester Stallone had it easy. As Brokeback Mountain got him an Oscar nomination maybe Southpaw will do the same.Billy Hope is a kid raised in an orphanage as a foundling as is his loving and supportive wife Rachel McAdams. They have a daughter played by Oona Laurence who is their whole world. When McAdams is killed in an unspeakable tragedy, Gyllenhaal's world falls apart and he has to make one long comeback.As a kid who was raised by the social welfare system it's the system that decides what he must do to gain back his child. Gyllenhaal is wonderful as a man who successfully conquers the badder angels of his nature to gain it all back, title, child, and self respect.McAdams should be singled out for a moving death scene ranking up there with some of the screen's best. Also Forest Whitaker who trains the ex-champ for his comeback should also be singled out.Watching Gyllenhaal as Billy Hope put me in mind of heavyweight contender Hurricane Jackson when I was a kid. There's no science in Hope's style, he just wades in and brawls. Hope will take two or three punches to get in his shot. As McAdams points out he'll be punch drunk within a few years. Whitaker puts a little science in his boxing persona. Hurricane Jackson was very much like Billy Hope and did in fact end up punch drunk.This is a fine boxing film and Oscar nominations could come for Gyllenhaal and McAdams.",8,18,28,6 November 2015
21 Jump Street," You Better Be Ready To Jump
","This is definitely not the 21 Jump Street that I remember from the 80s. The program that launched Johnny Depp as a star had its funny moments, usually supplied by Peter DeLuise, but the episodes tackled some very serious topics and many of them were outstanding drama without a laugh in them.Such is not the case here where you've got a couple of misfit cops who might have graduated from the Police Academy that George Gaynes was the commandant of. The old Jump Street program that was in an abandoned chapel is being revived for the new millenia and Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum have been selected for the program because of their youthful demeanor.Their rather impatient captain, Ice Cube sends them into a high school to bust a drug ring after the death of one of the students. These two manage to mismatch their covers, but incredibly enough it seems to work out for them.Tatum and Hill have some history between them. Tatum was a popular jock and an academic dud who barely graduated. Hill was a nerdy kid who couldn't get anyone of the opposite sex to look at him. For him this is a big do over, but he barely keeps his mind on the assignment.By the advertising I knew I was not going to get the old familiar 21 Jump Street other than cameo appearances by some of the series regulars back in the day. But I've seen it all before and done better even in the Police Academy movies which never pretended to be comedy of the lowest common denominator.The film has some comic moments, but will disappoint people who think they're going to see a big screen version of what was a big hit in the late 80s.",5,4,7,3 April 2012
Captain America: The First Avenger," America's Super Soldier
","Chris Evans who seems to be specializing in super heroes after just doing a couple of Fantastic Four movies as Johnny Storm the human torch, is now debuting as Captain America: The First Avenger. This will be like the Harry Potter series, the first of many projected films about Marvel Comics super hero coming out of World War II when choices seemed a lot simpler then.Notice the somewhat out of focus cinematography where Evans is introduced as 98 pound weakling Steve Rogers from Brooklyn who try as he might can't get taken by any of the Armed Services after Pearl Harbor. Something in the young man's earnestness and decency appeals to scientist refugee from Hitler Stanley Tucci and he takes him for a secret program the government has in developing enhanced super soldiers. Looking at it today it sounds like they're giving steroids out.Evans is to be the first of many, but he stays just a prototype after Tucci is killed by Nazi spies. Over in the Reich a Reinhardt Heydrich type character is also conducting experiments along the same line with a little less care. His dosage turns him into a really ugly crimson character now called Red Skull who is busy developing a cult of personality around himself and some enhanced Nazi soldiers who are already well indoctrinated into master race type theories. Red Skull is played with appropriate menace by Hugo Weaving.Captain America is an enhanced human being, but by no means endowed with any super powers. He's as vulnerable as Batman in the right circumstances and Evans in his characterization leaves no doubt about that.Curiously enough back in World War II Captain America did come to the screen as a movie serial with Dick Purcell as the Captain. The catering budget for this film probably was around the same amount it took to create that whole serial.As the first of many projected Captain America films, The First Avenger is good Saturday matin√©e entertainment of the old fashioned kind.",Null,4,9,7 August 2011
American Hustle," Intoxicating and dangerous
","Watching American Hustle one of the things that truly got to me was how back in the day when J. Edgar Hoover ran the FBI nobody like Bradley Cooper's character could ever have gotten employed in that agency. Let alone have the FBI use someone like Christian Bale as a pawn in a sting. Hoover was such a stickler for straight arrow types that Cooper could never have gotten in the door. Of course Hoover also never went after organized crime, but I can't help thinking that his quirks about dress and deportment weren't completely bad after seeing American Hustle.American Hustle is the story of the Abscam scandal and with a lot of poetic license it's an account of how it was almost an accident that several members of Congress were ensnared with bribery charges. Our protagonist is Christian Bale who plays a low level conman, but one who is good. He's got as a sidekick Amy Adams who affects an English accent as part of their modus operandi. He and Adams are both trapped by FBI agent Bradley Cooper who in his own way is as much con artist as they are. Instead of arresting them, he admires the way they work and turns them into his own operatives.It's impossible to proceed with further plot description. The investigation just gets away from any control and instead of mobsters they're taking down members of Congress who are bribed to get citizenship for phony Arab sheik. In the end Bale has to use some of the techniques employed in The Sting to get out from under.American Hustle is about a world that is intoxicating and dangerous. Bale and Cooper are evenly matched pair of allied antagonists. Amy Adams sure gets her innings in. There's also Jennifer Lawrence whom you will not forget as Bale's wife who with her own selfish dizziness may get them all killed. All four were nominated for acting Oscars and not one of them won. In fact 10 nominations went to American Hustle and it did not take home a winner.All four of these players sublimate their own personalities into their characters to a degree rarely seen. Christian Bale in most of his films does that to a degree I've not seen since Paul Muni. But that all four did here is a tribute to director David O. Russell.Like the Scorsese classics Goodfellas and Casino, American Hustle changes all the names so a lot of license can be used. And of course with Robert DeNiro playing a small, but unforgettable role as mob boss, the identification is complete.American Hustle is a film not to be missed.",9,4,10,3 April 2014
The Godfather: Part II," The Continuing Saga Of The Corleones
","Although most movie sequels never equal the original this is certainly not the case of The Godfather: Part II. Many would argue it surpasses the original. With both films declared the Best Picture by the Motion Picture Academy in their separate years, I'd hate to argue the difference.In this case we should thank the executives at Paramount for retaining both director Francis Ford Coppola and the original The Godfather author Mario Puzo to put their talents to this film. I'd hate to think what would have happened in other hands. Certainly these two men knew their characters and knew how to expand on them. And the best thing about The Godfather: Part II is that one can pick up the story, at least the modern portion of this one without reference to the original. In fact viewing this film will give you a burning passion to see the first.Unlike The Godfather and The Godfather: Part III, this film runs on two parallel tracks. The modern story is a continuation of Al Pacino as Michael Corleone now residing on the shores of Lake Tahoe and now directing the family affairs from Nevada where the Corleone family is heavily into gambling as we well know organized crime was back in those days of the Fifties and Sixties. He's going into partnership with Lee Strassberg playing Hyman Roth, a thinly veiled portrait of Meyer Lansky. But there are a lot of things making Pacino hesitant about this move into Cuba under the Battista dictatorship.The prequel parallel story is how young Vito Corleone came to this country as an orphan and worked his way up to establish himself as a crime boss. Here Coppola does a brilliant job in capturing the flavor of pre-World War I New York in the Italian ghetto. Robert DeNiro is young Vito Corleone and won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Remarkable when you consider that two of his rivals were Lee Strassberg from this film and Michael V. Gazzo playing Frankie Pantangeli from this film as well, the Mafia kingpin turned Senate witness modeled on Joe Valachi. DeNiro and Marlon Brando have the unique distinction as players of winning an Oscar for playing the same role.The woman do better in this film as in the original. Talia Shire got an Oscar nomination in the Supporting Actress category as Connie Corleone Rizzi. You remember her husband betrays the family and is killed in the original. She now is a drunken dependent on Pacino. Diane Keaton's character of Kay Adams Corleone is expanded here as well. She's a cultural outsider and the Sicilian vendetta code that she's expected to approve without comment becomes too much to bare. Her scene with Pacino when she tells him she's leaving him is one of the best for both in their respective careers.Overlooked unfortunately at award time was John Cazale as Fredo Corleone. He's the middle son who's passed over for succession after eldest son James Caan is killed in The Godfather. Fredo's big moment in The Godfather is being unable to fire his weapon in defense of his father being shot and how he breaks down.Fredo's got feelings as John Cazale dramatically points out. He does something really stupid in this film and it costs him dear. Cazale has some of the best moments in this film.If the first Godfather film doesn't do it, The Godfather: Part II will have you permanently hooked on the inner workings and dynamics of the Corleone family both in the criminal and personal sense.",10,8,12,17 March 2008
Notting Hill," Media goldfish bowl
","Notting Hill is a neighborhood in London and it's the title of a romantic comedy
starring Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant. Two of the most unlikely lovers you could
ever imagine get together here.Grant is the respectable, but somewhat dull proprietor of a bookstore in Notting
Hill which specializes in travel books. It looks like he's getting by, but truth be
told Grant's perfectly happy with just making enough to pay the bills and a little
extra.Back in the day after she retired from the screen for almost 50 years it was one
of those urban legends in New York City to spot Greta Garbo out and about and you'd never know but when she might get a notion to stop into a bookstore like Grant's. In this case Julia Roberts plays a movie star not unlike
the real Julia Roberts. Garbo mysterious she's not.For if she was I doubt Hugh Grant would have considered approaching her. As
for Roberts she's looking at Grant as a bit of respite from her life in the media
goldfish bowl. When she's discovered it's disaster for both of them.Notting Hill is a nice romantic comedy with very believable leads in a fairy tale
fantasy. I mean who doesn't have a fantasy of wooing and winning some
celebrity you might admire or be crushing out on. In that sense Notting Hill
has a universal appeal.In an unbilled part Alec Baldwin plays her boyfriend whom we learn little about factually. But he comes across as an egotistical fathead. One thing
you're certain of, no matter what happens with Grant, Roberts and Baldwin
won't be an item much longer.Notting Hill, a nice romantic comedy/fantasy. May you win the celebrity of
your desires.",7,2,2,14 June 2019
The Aviator," Hobbies
","Switching from gangsters to one of the most colorful tycoons of industry Martin Scorsese took the first step in making The Aviator a success when he cast Leonardo DiCaprio as Howard Hughes. As he did as J. Edgar Hoover, DiCaprio has the spirit of the man invade his body as he portrays the Texas based industrialist, aviator, and movie producer. He had all those careers at the same time and dealt with a lot demons besides.The Hughes fortune comes from Howard Hughes, Sr. who patented a drill bit that is the foundation of all oil drilling on planet Earth. If you don't use that drill bit, you can dig for oil with a pick and shovel for however long it takes. It is one of the most profitable patents in the world and it was the foundation of the Hughes wealth.Which allowed Howard Hughes to indulge himself in two passions which were to all intents and purposes, hobbies. Aviation and movie producing were what drove him. And when we meet him he's shooting and reshooting and reshooting Hell's Angels. A lot of his own money went into the film which eventually was a success and gave Hughes the first of many perks as a Hollywood tycoon, Jean Harlow as played here by Gwen Stefani.Faith Domergue, Ava Gardner, and most importantly Katharine Hepburn and there were many others follow in the Hughes story. Cate Blanchett won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for becoming Katharine Hepburn. With some of the liberties taken I don't think it's an accident that The Aviator came out a year after Hepburn died at 96. The movie also missed Jean Peters whom Hughes actually married and Terry Moore who is still alive and who claims she did marry him. Jane Russell and The Outlaw and the famous brassiere personally designed by Hughes also get a passing mention.As for aviation which was his real love, Hughes had a decades rivalry with Alec Baldwin as Juan Trippe of Pan American Airlines. Trippe had more friends in Congress, particularly a rightwing Republican Senator named Ralph Owen Brewster played by Alan Alda. Alda got an Oscar nomination himself playing the smarmy Brewster who threatens to destroy Hughes by Congressional investigation. Hughes who was hardly a liberal in his politics totally turned the tables on the Brewster committee and the Senator himself. Not shown in the film but in 1952 Hughes made it his business to defeat Brewster going for a third term and did.Besides Blanchett's Oscar The Aviator won several others and was nominated for several more including Best Picture and Best Actor for Leonardo DiCaprio. In my memory Howard Hughes was the eccentric billionaire who stayed in seclusion and ran his enterprises through a network of underlings. DiCaprio does a wonderful job in showing how Hughes became what he was, his mania against germs instilled by his mother. To have all that money and be living in the largest plastic bubble one could create. Hughes made himself a prisoner in his own mind before he became a prisoner of the jail he personally designed.The Aviator is a marvelous insight into one of the most eccentric and colorful people of the last century.",9,0,1,18 July 2012
Oblivion," Burned over Earth
","I see that a lot of folks are happy with Tom Cruise's latest film which is his first venture into the science fiction genre since his remake of War Of The Worlds. I have to confess I'm a minority here since the story left me with more questions than when I started.As we learn from Tom's narration at the beginning he's a survivor from Earth after an alien invasion scorched the planet leaving unfit for human habitation. But we've managed by the time of the middle 20th century to reach Titan, the largest satellite of Saturn. That's where earth survivors have gone. The aliens also destroyed the moon which as we know has a great deal to do with our gravity as well as determining tides. The natural disasters resulting were just a prelude to the war that followed.Cruise is a repair technician who fixes the drones that patrol the burned over Earth. Like most from Titan his memory has been wiped of times before. But those things that Sigmund Freud talked about, where the Krels created monsters from in Forbidden Planet, dreams in forbidden places bring up memories now that the Earth is a forbidden planet.I watched Oblivion and quite frankly I thought the story and script were incoherent and the direction almost non-existent. I'm sure that the legion of fans Tom Cruise will go see it. That and all the scientologists in the world. I'm sure Tom saw some scientology doctrine in the story which must have been what attracted him to the film.",5,5,14,16 June 2013
Bohemian Rhapsody," He will......He will.......Rock you
","Rami Malek best known for playing subdued computer programmer Elliott Alderson in the TV series Robot takes on quite a different character as lead singer
Freddie Mercury of Queen. A rock legend Mercury died of AIDS in 1991, but
the melody as an older songwriter wrote still lingers on.I learned quite a bit in the fact that both Malek and Mercury came from some
real minority religious faiths that have seen their share of persecution. I did
not know that Malek came from a Coptic Christian family in Egypt. They are
certainly people who feel it every time Moslem fundamentalism gets a boost.
I have a friend who like Rami Malek's family is also a Coptic Christian and fled
Africa for Canada.Freddie Mercury born Farrokh Bolsara is from a family who followed the
Zoroastrian faith. It is the religion of ancient Persia and there are not too many of them left in Iran. Most of the 130,000 left in the world are in India
known as Parsees. Like the Judeo-Christian-Moslem religions it is a religion
of an all encompassing Deity and an equal bad one like the western Satan.
Like the others Zoroastrianism frowns on same sex kanoodling.Homosexuality very frowned on by his parents and Mercury himself did have a
loving relationship with Mary Austin played by Lucy Boynton. Still he could not deny himself and one of my favorite scenes in the film is when Queen is
on tour in America and there's wordless scene where Malek checks out a hunky
truck driver at a service station and follows him into the men's room. Mercury
was in the closet still, but the door was opening wider.The familiar soundtrack of Queen favorites are the second best part of the
film and in concert Malek really becomes Freddie Mercury. What an incredible
name he gave himself, mercurial and flamboyant with an electrifying stage
and screen presence.Bohemian Rhapsody won a Best Actor Oscar for Rami Malek and also got awards for Editing and Sound Mixing and Sound Editing. It missed out for
Best Picture.Most of all Bohemian Rhapsody is quite the tribute to Queen and the performer and the artist named Freddie Mercury.",8,2,2,5 March 2019
"Good Morning, Vietnam"," Goooooooooooooooooooood Morning Preston Sturges
","It finally hit me when I watched Good Morning Vietnam what this film reminded me of. It was the famous Preston Sturges classic, Sullivan's Travels which coincidentally as it turns out is one of my favorite films.Both the real life Adrian Cronauer and Joel McCrea's fictional John L. Sullivan have to come to the same realization, that what they do matters a great deal. In Sullivan's Travels it's to the movie going public in general, in the case of Cronauer it's to the GIs in Vietnam stuck in a war where no one could ever know who the enemy was. A few laughs from a comic genius was necessary to get them through the day in their very cockeyed world.Adrian Cronauer was a real life person, but if he didn't bear a resemblance to Robin Williams, he should have. One of the great comic masters of any era in entertainment, Robin Williams is given full range for his zany sense of humor to work its magic with Cronauer. He's ably abetted and assisted by the other staff members of Armed Forces Radio Forest Whitaker and Robert Wuhl. Bruno Kirby is great as the clueless lieutenant in charge and so is J.T. Walsh who represents the limits of the military mind as the sergeant major out to get Williams by hook or very dirty crook.Williams himself doesn't understand the complexities of the Vietnam situation. That fact is brought home to him graphically when he's betrayed by his own innate decency.Next to Williams my favorite in the cast is Noble Willingham who plays the general who has overall charge of Armed Forces Radio there. He's a tough, but compassionate military man, the exact opposite of J.T. Walsh whom he has to reign in.Good Morning Vietnam is a frank portrayal of a war experience told with humor and irony through the eyes of Robin Williams.Preston Sturges would have absolutely adored this film.",8,19,22,30 June 2009
The Italian Job," 'We're All A Little Emotional In This One'
","Having not yet seen the original The Italian Job that Michael Caine I have no frame of reference to compare it to. Still this version is fast moving and fun and you got to tip your hat to a bunch of professional thieves who know their business and steal without it being bloody. Donald Sutherland has assembled a crack team of thieves all with special skills that include Mark Wahlberg, Edward Norton, Mos Def, Jason Stathem and Seth Green. The six pull off a well timed heist of 35 million dollars in gold bullion bars. But then Norton gets real greedy and in turn steals the bullion from the rest, killing Sutherland and nearly all the others. Of course they're out for revenge, but revenge is a dish best served cold. Still they're all a little emotional on this one given the circumstances.New on the team is Charlize Theron who is Sutherland's daughter and she brings safe-cracking skills into the mix. They will be needed before the film is over.Edward Norton in his career has done a nice variety of sociopathic types from The Score, Primal Fear, and American History X. He's some piece of work in The Italian Job, but Norton is an actor who creates a peculiar fascination with the evil he does.The key man as the team attempts to heist the bullion again from Norton is Seth Green the computer hacker. What he does I can't say, but it's the equivalent of directing a mouse in a maze.This version of The Italian Job can safely stand on its own merits as entertaining and thrilling. Even without me seeing the first one as of yet.",7,4,6,13 August 2011
Baby Driver," Lots of flash
","Watching Baby Driver I can't help but wonder as Kevin Spacey's career is in crisis
mode is Baby Driver a film he might want to have as a swan song? He chews a 
bit of scenery, but it's in keeping with his character and so is everyone else in the
film.If you like car chases this is your film. If you like teen idols with a bit of pout this
is also your film. Ansel Elgort plays an early 20 something with two distinctions,
he's hard of hearing and he drives with the speed and skill of someone in the
Earnhardt clan.Elgort is in the title role and his nickname is Baby and relative to the rest of the
crews he works on robberies as a getaway driver he is a baby.. Spacey also 
considers him a good luck charm and there most definitely is something going
on with the two of them that he can't do without him. He says himself this 
Reifenschneider planner character that he always gets a different crew for each
job other than Elgort who is a constant.Back when I was at the Crime Victims Board I had a case of someone being 
wounded in a robbery attempt of a post office looking for benefits as an innocent victim. I remember asking the assigned detective why would anyone
rob a post office because that's federal jurisdiction bringing in the FBI and the
post office's own police (they have their own police, note the Alan Ladd classic
Appointment With Danger). He replied he couldn't figure it out unless you
delve into insanity.Kevin, that's the reason that post offices don't often get robbed not because
they're neglected. The big brain of a caper would know that.Hearing the allegations of sexual abuse coming out now about Spacey you also
have to wonder about him and Elgort. Sad, but true and the producers certainly couldn't anticipate the great sexual harassment epidemic springing
up when Baby Driver was cast and made. Now as we watch the movie on TV
and on DVD and live streamed the viewer will wonder also.But apart from that Baby Driver has a lot of flash and very little substance to it.",4,4,8,18 December 2017
The Caine Mutiny," A Studio Summit Type of film
","With the breakdown of the studio system in the Fifties, players no longer tied by contract to studios could command there own salaries. And the studios facing the competition of television paid them. It would have been almost impossible to make The Caine Mutiny a decade earlier. Three of the principal players Humphrey Bogart(Warner Brothers},Van Johnson,(MGM), and Fred MacMurray(Paramount)were all tied to other studios. But come the Fifties and Harry Cohn puts together a great cast for a great ensemble production at Columbia. Humphrey Bogart got his third Academy Award nomination, but lost to Marlon Brando in On the Waterfront. Brando had been nominated and lost for three straight previous years, he was not to be denied again. In fact Bogey when he won for The African Queen in 1951 upset a heavily favored Brando. Some kind of poetic justice there.There's a scene when Bogart takes command of the USS Caine from Tom Tully who's run a pretty slack ship up to that point. He gives Bogart a peace of advice about taking an easy strain, that the Caine was a tired ship. He didn't realize that he was talking to a tired captain.Maybe someone in the Navy should have realized that and given Bogart a much needed rest. But they didn't and thereby hangs a tale.The crew and the officers of the Caine, used to the easy ways of Tully, get real resentful of Bogart. But they also notice some disturbing behavior patterns in Bogart. It's a fine line that Bogart in his performance has to walk. Other reviewers compare his performance in The Caine Mutiny to his work in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre. Both characters disintegrate mentally, but whereas Fred C. Dobbs has nothing to hold him back, Philip Francis Queeg is in a command situation with the lives of his crew and of his ship at stake. And Queeg is not an evil man.Fred MacMurray by now had shown he could do a lot more than the light comedy leads Paramount usually put him in. As Ensign Keefer who plants the seeds of mutiny on the Caine, he's shown to be a really shallow character.Just as shallow is young Ensign Willie Keith played by newcomer Robert Francis. He's the hotshot from Princeton who's newly assigned to the Caine. Up to the point of the mutiny, it's his eyes in which we see the action on the Caine unfold, first with Tully in command and then with Bogart. After that it's Jose Ferrer's viewpoint as the Defense Counsel at the Court Martial.Most reviewers single out Bogart and MacMurray for the most praise in the cast. I think Van Johnson is sadly overlooked. He's got a very complex part. He's the decent executive officer who sees Bogart's disintegration, doesn't know what to do about it, and gets manipulated by MacMurray. The key scene for him in the film is to convince Navy lawyer Jose Ferrer he's worthy of defending. Johnson does very well in that scene, maybe his best performance on film.Jose Ferrer doesn't get into the film until it's two thirds done and then he dominates. He's a bit of a manipulator himself at the court martial. He also provides the real final verdict of the affair of The Caine Mutiny.Tom Tully for playing Captain DeVries also got an Oscar nomination in the Supporting Actor category, but he lost to Edmond O'Brien for The Barefoot Contessa. Tully's character is critical here, he provides the contrast between himself and Bogart as men and as commanders. He's also not mentioned enough in critiques of the Caine Mutiny.Most of the time I like for films to be resolved. But the very strength of The Caine Mutiny as drama is that the issues are unresolved. Could certain actions by the members of the crew, by the Navy itself prevented the whole thing? Just how culpable were the men and officers of the Caine in a mutiny? You may scratch your head at the conclusion, but you'll also be breathless by the depth of the performances in this fine ensemble film.",9,18,33,5 October 2005
Footloose," 'Let's Hear It For The Boy'
","Based on a true incident that happened in a small Oklahoma town, young Kevin Bacon arrives at a small town in one of the reddest parts of the USA. This small town is positively crimson because they've actually outlawed dancing except maybe in the privacy of your own home.This extreme and probably unconstitutional law started when a few years ago Reverend John Lithgow and Dianne Weist's son was killed after one of these dances. Lithgow himself is not an extremist, but he's letting some of the more extreme rednecks in the town to start in on book burning. As Robert Preston said in The Music Man, 'Gotta keep the young ones moral after school'.Of course Bacon takes up with Lori Singer who is Lithgow and Weist's other child when he arrives and she's quite the wild child. But his standing up to her old man impresses her like none of the other young men in the town. Footloose has a nice liberal message about the excesses of religious zeal which is certainly pertinent for today. But it's the musical score in the film that really makes it special, one of the best scores of the Eighties. The title song and Let's Hear It For The Boy both received Oscar nominations for Best Original Song.This film proved to be Kevin Bacon's breakout role as an actor. Although he never was quite leading man material as his subsequent career has proved, he's certainly had staying power in playing a nice variety of roles of both good and bad and mixed individuals. No question here he's the good guy outsider. Best scene for me is him teaching Christopher Penn how to dance to Let's Hear It For The Boy.A film quite ground in the Eighties, Footloose still has much relevance for today's audience.",7,1,3,1 June 2010
The Color of Money," 'I Want Your Best Game'
","Although a lot of this plot is taken from the Richard Widmark rodeo film When the Legends Die, The Color of Money is still a worthy film and a good successor to the early Paul Newman classic, The Hustler.I imagine that players like Paul Newman who create classic characters like Fast Eddie Felson must be bombarded with scripts or story ideas for sequels. Paul Newman is one of the most discriminating of players and up to this point he had only reprised his role in Harper with The Drowning Pool.When he decided to do The Color of Money there was no need to age Newman twenty five years with makeup. Time had done a better job than any makeup man could have done. Time had also honed his acting abilities so that he could realistically recreate one of his classic characters in an older generation.One thing about The Color of Money is that can and does stand independently of The Hustler. You do not have to have seen the earlier film to know what's happening here. Nevertheless in that earlier film, promising new pool player Eddie Felson does not take direction from mobsters who effectively end his career before he gets it firmly on track.Fast forward from 1961 to 1986 and Paul Newman is now a liquor salesman who hangs around poolrooms in tank towns and dreams what might have been. A young kid with a 'sledgehammer break' gets Newman's attention and its Tom Cruise. He's got a girlfriend, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio with him and the three sort of adopt each other. It's a complicated relationship between all three of them and all three of them manage to convey the many ups and downs of this triangle. Newman teaches Cruise the tricks of the trade including how to tank a game occasionally to bring up the betting odds. In many ways Cruise learns too well and Newman hanging around with him makes him realize just how much he's missed because of the gangland blackball.Reportedly Newman and Cruise got along splendidly during the making of The Color of Money. Their joint interest in auto racing cemented a very good working relationship.Paul Newman was also nominated during the eighties for Absence of Malice and The Verdict which are two of my favorites with him. Unfortunately in the first he was up against Henry Fonda who had been similarly snubbed for years by the Academy and was dying during the Oscar voting. The second time Ben Kingsley portrayal of the title role in the massive blockbuster Gandhi obscured what I think is Newman's finest performance in The Verdict.Though the Oscar was an Oscar for lifetime of work, The Color of Money is a worthy sequel to The Hustler. Martin Scorsese got great performances out of the whole cast. And Paul Newman finally got a matching Oscar to go with the one Joanne Woodward won for The Three Faces of Eve for their mantelpiece.",9,26,34,21 July 2007
The Thing," Parasite from another planet
","Even with John Carpenter's dazzling special effects this updated version of The Thing lacks a lot of the pizazz from the 1951 Cold War classic. This however is truly a thing as opposed to James Arness's plant man from 1951.It also takes place at the other end, the bottom of the world. Kurt Russell and others are on a scientific outpost there when they come upon some remains of something they can't quite identify.As I said it's not the plant man of the first film. Instead it's like a parasite invading the human or at first canine hosts which are the expedition's sled dogs. After a while the humans don't know who has been taking over.Lots of elements of both the Alien franchise and Invasion Of The Body Snatchers present in this film. But it doesn't hold a candle to my favorite plant man.",5,7,14,20 October 2016
21," The Kids Who Broke The Bank At Las Vegas
","Straight A student Jim Sturgess at MIT is having a real problem, he's one of many geniuses trying to get into Harvard Medical School, the cost is going to be over $300.000.00 if he does not get a prized scholarship that several other geniuses are competing for.So it seems too good to be true when his advanced calculus professor, Kevin Spacey, let's Sturgess in on a little sideline he has going for him. Seems that Spacey has recruited an elite team of his most promising students to work the blackjack tables in Las Vegas, something he used to do himself, but now he's too well known there. Blackjack or 21 he says is the most popular game at the casinos and the one it's easiest to beat if you know how to count the cards.Counting cards isn't exactly illegal, but something the casino owners do discourage. The discourager is Lawrence Fishburne and he's pretty good at his job, at both spotting and discouraging counters.Spacey's team consists of Sturgess, Jacob Pitts, Aaron Yoo, Kate Bosworth, and Liza Lapira and all do a good job at convincing you they are actually MIT students and not pretty faces from Hollywood pretending to be geniuses. Spacey of course is his usual fine self.I particularly liked Pitts's performance as the kid whose jealousy of Sturgess ultimately wrecks the whole operation. 21 is a pretty good film with good location filming on MIT and in Las Vegas giving it an air of authenticity.You have to love how Sturgess gets the bankroll to Vegas.",8,6,11,6 April 2008
The Revenant," Survival
","A favorite era of mine for film stories has always been the mountain man era in the American west. No white people in great numbers, just single shot weapons, they were the ones outnumbered so survival against the Indians was far more an even struggle than in the post Civil War west. The Revenant by dint of its many nominations has laid claim to being the greatest film about that era ever made. It goes up against such items as Across The Wide Missouri, The Big Sky, and Mountain Men, Jeremiah Johnson all pretty good films.It would have been hard to deny Leonardo DiCaprio a Best Actor Oscar this time around. He's on screen for most of the time and with minimal dialog DiCaprio has to use facial expressions and body language to convey his emotions. He does it well and should share his Oscar with the cameraman who did all those closeups of him.The plot is best compared to another mountain man picture A Man Called Horse that starred Richard Harris. DiCaprio who was guide to the expedition of fur trappers is badly mauled by a grizzly bear and is after being toted for quite a distance is abandoned by Tom Hardy who claims he died. DiCaprio just wants to settle the score. Unlike Richard Harris he does not find a friendly tribe of Indians to take him in. His survival is his personal story.The Revenant also won the Cinematography Oscar for the shooting of the rugged winter country these men are in. It's so good the landscape, cold and forbidding, becomes almost a character in the film.Like The Old Man And The Sea was for Spencer Tracy The Revenant is a personal film for Leonardo DiCaprio. Unlike Tracy who had that magnificent speaking voice for the narration, no narration here. Just anguished expressions convey what DiCaprio is feeling.Leo got his Oscar and it was a deserved one for The Revenant. It's a great film, but very brutal at times.",8,0,1,8 August 2016
Trouble with the Curve," Family, health and baseball
","Trouble With A Curve casts Clint Eastwood as an aging baseball scout for the Atlanta Braves with both family and health issues. His family is his daughter Amy Adams who is a young attorney whom he hasn't seen in years. His health issues include macular degeneration of his eyes and a scout without good vision is handicapped in his job. My late uncle had that and I know how that eventually impaired him.Clint's imparted a lot of his baseball knowledge to Adams and Braves GM John Goodman has asked Adams to accompany Eastwood on a scouting trip to the minor leagues before the annual draft to check on a prospect as the Braves have the number one draft pick in the National League. A lot of air is cleared in this trip.Also Clint renews an another old acquaintance with Justin Timberlake who was a former pitcher that Clint signed back in the day, but who blew his arm out and now he's a scout for the Boston Red Sox who have the number one draft pick in the American League. Adams and Timberlake hit it off, but the road to romance is a rocky one. A washed up ball player and an upwardly mobile yuppie attorney are not a usual mix.Though the film isn't quite of the level of Million Dollar Baby and Gran Torino, it's still a real treat for Eastwood fans. Like Million Dollar Baby the best scenes are Clint and Amy's just as in the other film his scenes with Hilary Swank his surrogate daughter. Timberlake also proves to be a capable actor.Although Adams saves Clint's job with a gift of sorts, you know eventually he will have to quit. But like all other Eastwood characters, he's going to do it on his own terms. And she could have a nice career in a baseball front office as women increasingly are making an impact in all areas of the sport except the actual playing field.Trouble With The Curve if nothing else proves Eastwood is a great judge of material that's still good for him and that takes into account his age. He's one productive 80 something when he's not involved in politics and talking to an empty chair.",8,4,5,14 January 2013
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Harry the fugitive
","Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows, Part I finds young Harry played by Daniel Radcliffe and his posse Rupert Grint and Emma Watson fugitives after a palace coup at Hogwarts. The academy of magic has been taken over by Professor Rufus Snape after headmaster Dumbledore has been killed. It's not just that Harry and his friends know too much, it's that Harry has a mysterious connection with the mysterious black lord Voldemort, the evil genius behind all the bad things happening. And Voldemort is quite anxious to sever the connection and sever young Mr. Potter from immortality.In this next to last of the Harry Potter series the familiar cast goes through their usual paces as young Harry and his friends are exiled from Hogwarts and have to live by their wits, knowledge of magic, and the help of friends. The Deathly Hallows refer to three charmed objects that he must destroy to keep Voldemort from taking over the world of magic.This film received Academy Award recognition with Oscar nominations for Best Visual Effects and Best Art Direction. One thing the Potter films have done is certainly brought an appreciation of Charles Dickens to the young. After you've read J.K. Rowling's work, you will love how she's given such descriptive names to her characters in the way Dickens used to. And if Harry Potter isn't a 21st reincarnation of David Copperfield, then I don't know my Dickens.",7,0,1,31 July 2011
Cold Mountain," Invested with nobility
","Anthony Minghella knew something of the Civil War in locating his story in North Carolina. Of all the states that seceded to form the Confederacy, North Carolina may have been the most reluctant. It's Governor Zebulon Vance who is mentioned in the story dragged his feet in giving help to the Confederate government and its citizens save for the east where the plantations were never really embraced the Southern cause. Jude Law's attitude about fighting for a rich man to own slaves was not at all uncommon in North Carolina.Which after a well staged recreation of the siege at Petersburg which when the north blew up the Confederate defenses by tunneling under and mining them with explosives did not have the desired result, Law decides he's sick of war and just quits to go back to his sweetheart Nicole Kidman on Cold Mountain. In the meantime Nicole is having her own problems just keeping body, soul, and property together on the small family farm. So the film proceeds along two tracks of Law's journey and Kidman's problems.The stronger track for me is clearly Kidman and her problems. Renee Zellweger won a Best Supporting Actress Award for playing a young white trash woman who Kidman takes on for just board and feed to help with the farm. Without her help the farm's survival would be problematic although she has to put up with some pithy observation as well. Zellweger invests this simple character with so many dimensions her performance even without the Oscar capping it is her personal best. Kidman while not to the plantation manor born being the daughter of minister Donald Sutherland also is not used to manual farm labor. She grows in character as the film progresses.As for Law and Kidman as well he has to worry about the Home guard, a self appointed group of militia taking over because official government machinery has broken down. Probably before the war they were slave catchers, now they hunt deserters and those who aid and abet them. Giovanni Ribisi also scores well as a young man in the home guard who declined to serve at places like Petersburg. Ribisi is some piece of work.Besides Zellweger's Oscar, Cold Mountain was deservedly nominated for a flock of other Oscars. It's a marvelous look at the decline of the Confederacy, a cause that simply would not die quietly. In its own way the survivors are invested with the same kind of nobility that the Gone With The Wind cast was.",8,2,3,23 July 2012
North by Northwest," 'War Is Hell, Even When It's A Cold One.'
","Following up on his two previous masterpieces, The Thirty Nine Steps and Saboteur; Alfred Hitchcock put together his ultimate chase film with elements of both coming into Ernest Lehman's screenplay. I've seen figures that show in terms of box office and later video sales and rentals, North By Northwest was Hitchcock's most successful film financially.At this point Alfred Hitchcock's name over the title could sell a movie, but I'm sure he didn't mind having Cary Grant in it to draw the movie going public. This was Cary's fourth and final appearance in a Hitchcock film and I think it is his best performance in one.Like in the two films I cited, Cary is innocently caught up in a web of intrigue and he got there by just answering a telephone page at a hotel dining room. He took a call right after someone paged a George Kaplan and the bad guys think he's Kaplan. And he gets grabbed.It's a devilishly difficult situation for him because there ain't no George Kaplan. He's a fictitious guy who was invented by one of our spy agencies (that's never identified in the story)to take the heat off an agent very close to masterspy James Mason. Mason tries to murder Grant by getting him drunk and putting him behind the wheel of a car. Later on Grant gets framed for murder while trying to find out what's going on and he's on the run from New York to Chicago to Rapid City and the Mount Rushmore monument.James Mason plays the cultured villain Philip Van Dam. Mr. Mason who had some of the most precise diction heard this side of Ronald Colman on screen, could play villain and hero and a lot in between equally well. Among other things he's a bi-sexual and his henchman/boyfriend Martin Landau is jealous of his involvement with Eva Marie Saint. With the Code still firmly in place, it was quite daring for Mason to refer to Landau's suspicions as his 'woman's intuition.Eva Marie Saint joins the list of cool and fiery blonds Hitchcock was so partial to for his films. I'm surprised he never used Eva Marie again, she seemed the perfect successor for Grace Kelly who if she hadn't become a princess would have been playing this part for sure.Bernard Herrman who wrote the acclaimed score for Hitchcock's Vertigo followed that up with an equally good score. Especially during the moments of Grant's tangle with a crop duster plane and the chase across the Mount Rushmore Monument, Herrman made great use of music to help the audience feel the tension. It's a great instrumental piece, violins that seem to pound with a drum counterpoint. The best kind of film music.And why wouldn't it be because North By Northwest is some of the best kind of film making.",10,5,11,1 September 2006
Knowing," The Arbitrary Whim Of Nature Itself
","A very strange and disturbed girl has the idea for a time capsule to be placed on school grounds to be opened by the children of 2009 to see what the kids of the Eisenhower era in 1959 thought their future would be. When it comes time to put her contribution in however, young Lara Robinson just comes up with a page and a series of meaningless numbers.Meaningless to everyone except physicist Nicholas Cage who is one of the parents present in 2009 when the time capsule is opened. They prophesy a series of disasters including what Cage horrifyingly realizes could be the end of the world itself. At the same time some mysterious strangers seem very interested in both Cage's son, Chandler Cantlebury and Lara Robinson playing her own granddaughter. What their interest is not even a renowned scientist like Cage can figure out.The ironic thing is that what would bring about the end of the world has nothing whatsoever to do with our behavior environmentally or with any mad terrorist act. It's the arbitrary whim of nature itself and the frightening thing is that also Knowing isn't going to help mankind one single bit.Nicholas Cage does a fine job covering the ground between concerned scientist and concerned single parent. There's also a bit of spiritual journey for him when he reconciles at the very end with his minister father. As for the mysterious strangers, they've got quite an answer to things which there's no way I'm going to reveal.Knowing has a mixed message between rational thought and spiritual searching that can be interpreted in a lot of different ways. It's a film people will be debating for years about.",8,8,15,31 March 2009
Doctor Zhivago," Romance And Revolution
","You really do miss something when you see a formatted version of Doctor Zhivago as I recently did. This is the kind of film that was made literally for the big screen. It's what epic movie making is all about.I also think that you should see this on the big screen back to back with Warren Beatty's Reds. Two very opposite views of the Russian Revolution, one from the inside and one from the outside. You could have a very interesting discussion on which is which.The title character, played by Omar Sharif, is Dr. Yuri Zhivago who is both doctor and poet. He was orphaned as a child and raised in the house of Ralph Richardson and Siobhan McKenna. He marries their daughter, Geraldine Chaplin who of course he loves, but naturally like a sister. The real passion of his life is Julie Christie who is married to a committed Bolshevik in Tom Courtenay. Courtenay is also a guy, with shall we say, some issues. She loves him in her own way though and goes to search for him when he volunteers for the army to subvert it as the Bolshevik plan was when Russia entered World War I. Christie meets Sharif at the front and the passion ignites. But all around them the society they knew and were brought up in is crumbling about them. Their story set against the background of the Russian Revolution is what Doctor Zhivago is all about.Zhivago knows change was inevitable, the old order in Russia was ready to be toppled. But he's a poet and not one to let his art be subverted for the sake of the state. Fortunately he's also a doctor and his services are needed, in fact the Bolsheviks rather brutally insist on his accompanying one of their brigades as a medical officer.I still remember as a lad the acclaim Boris Pasternak's novel got world wide when it was published while being banned in his home land. After winning the Nobel Prize for Literature, Pasternak died shortly thereafter. It's a pity he did not live to see this film, I think he would have approved.From the deserts of Arabia to the steppes of Russia, David Lean certainly knew how to direct a film that involved vastness. Yet the people of his stories be it Lawrence of Arabia or Doctor Zhivago never get lost in the spectacle. Lean makes you care about the characters that Pasternak created, you get involved in the romance of Sharif and Christie, you want to know if they'll make it in this country undergoing revolutionary convulsions.Other performances of note are Alec Guinness as Sharif's half brother Yevgeny Zhivago, a committed Bolshevik himself and Rod Steiger as the opportunistic Komorovsky.Doctor Zhivago won a host of awards in several technical categories, strangely enough it wasn't nominated for Best Picture in 1965 though. It is a classic and even now with the Soviet Union a memory, I doubt if even a Russian made remake of Zhivago could equal what David Lean and his wonderful cast gave us in 1965.",9,49,57,10 December 2006
American Beauty," New Neighbors Take Out An Old Marriage
","American Beauty finds successful forty something couple Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening coming to a crossroads in their marriage. Each of them is going through a mid-life crisis, manifesting itself quite differently in them and in their daughter, Thora Birch. The three of them have become like strangers occupying the same household and no kind of family.Spacey is bored with his job, his wife, and his life. His boredom is showing in his work and he's asked to leave, but not after extracting a nice severance package. Going back to his days as a youth, he gets a job in a fast food place and he buys an expensive classic car he's always wanted to own. And he's taken an interest in his daughter's friend Mena Suvari.Bening has become enamored of success and self help programs. She's a real estate salesperson and tries hard, maybe too hard. Sensing Spacey's indifference to her she drifts into an affair with real estate mogul Peter Gallagher. He actually tries at one point to rekindle things, but she worries more about Spacey spilling beer on the couch. Talk about cooling off the romance.All their lives change when they meet the new neighbors, the Fits Family. Withdrawn subdued mother Allison Janney and son Wes Bentley who is a drug dealer and who interests both Birch and Spacey for different reasons.But the most interesting part in American Beauty for me is Colonel Frank Fits of the USMC, father and husband and a man with a lot of issues that you will find out if seeing American Beauty. Though Spacey was Best Actor for 1999 and Annette Bening was nominated for Best Actress, but lost to Hilary Swank for Boys Don't Cry, to me Chris Cooper's performance as Colonel Fits steals the whole film.Director Sam Mendes and writer Alan Ball who won Oscars in their categories respectively opted for the Sunset Boulevard format of having the movie at intervals narrated by protagonist Kevin Spacey just as William Holden narrated the Billy Wilder classic. But the whole feel of this film most reminds me of the Gothic characters of Reflections In A Golden Eye. Even the fact that one of the major characters is a military man. Back in the day Reflections In A Golden Eye was a box office failure, but the success of American Beauty proves just how far ahead of its time Reflections In A Golden Eye was.Oh and I forgot, American Beauty was the winner of the Best Picture Oscar of 1999. It's destined to be an American classic Beauty for generations.",10,1,6,22 July 2008
Wanted," Off the wall
","Nice to see that Wanted was given Oscar nominations in two categories related to sound. Well the film was certainly loud enough. But maybe the noise was to cover up the idea that the story was off the wall and unbelievable.I can see in Wanted where the current cult TV hit Mr. Robot gets some of what is driving it. Our protagonist James McAvoy is a drone of a human being working almost like Jack Lemmon at his desk, taken advantage of by everyone senior to him as Lemmon was in The Apartment. He's even having woman troubles as his girlfriend is being completely faithless.Well one morning he's the target of a shooting and saved by girl Rambo Angelina Jolie. Turns out that McAvoy is the son of a professional assassin and he's got it in his blood to be one as well. Dad deserted the family as a kid and that's the reason for all of McAvoy's issues.Well McAvoy under the tutelage of Jolie and head Morgan Freeman our hero develops into a full blown Rambo type and joins the group of secret assassins that have been around for a thousand years. But of course this is hardly the end of the story. And what red blooded American male wouldn't want to get tutelage from Angelina Jolie?You've got to love Morgan Freeman. That man can make the most pretentious drivel sound like it's from the Old Testament. And he does it in film after film which he's doing for a hefty paycheck between Oscar material like Boys Don't Cry. Well, we all have bills to pay.Fans of mindless action films will love this.",3,0,3,16 March 2016
Judgment at Nuremberg," The Complainant At the Bar is Civilization Itself
","Following a trail first started by Marty, Judgment at Nuremberg is one of the first films to be taken from television. Abby Mann wrote this script for a live drama on Playhouse 90. Only Maximilian Schell and Werner Klemperer repeated their roles from the 1959 production. Others in that cast were Claude Rains as Judge Haywood and Paul Lukas as the defendant Ernest Janning.Stanley Kramer assembled a cast of some big movie names for his film and directed this film reverently as it has an eternal message. To get the film out of the Nuremberg Tribunal courtroom, the role of the widow of the German general played by Marlene Dietrich was created and the other German citizens were also created show that Kramer could get some dialog in about how the ordinary German felt. In the original play their only advocate is defense lawyer Maximilian Schell.Schell is some good advocate indeed. While not lessening the guilt of any of the four German judges in the dock, he does raise some disturbing questions about other societies and how very easily the slide into totalitarian brutality can happen. He also shows some of the worst aspects in German character in his cross examination of Judy Garland and Montgomery Clift.The Nuremberg Tribunal has been going on four two years now. The big Nazi fish have been dealt with and we're now trying four German judges who apparently forgot all about due process in their efforts to ingratiate themselves with the new Nazi regime. Clift and Garland are two examples of German everypeople who got caught up in it and their performances well merited Oscar nominations in the Supporting player categories.Richard Widmark is the lead prosecutor and this is probably one of the least complex roles Widmark ever played. He's identified as a New Deal liberal, a prot√©g√© of the late President Roosevelt. He was in at the liberation of concentration camps and it effected him. It made him the good advocate for civilization itself.In an original cast album of the film, the monologues with Burt Lancaster confessing his guilt and Spencer Tracy rendering the verdicts were included. Lancaster in a smaller way plays the part of Albert Speer who probably escaped the hangman by just throwing himself on the mercy of the court. He's the only one who shows contrition. His confession though is a textbook example of how a demagogue can come to power in a nation left without pride.Spencer Tracy and Maximilian Schell got Academy Award nominations for Best Actor with Schell winning. But Tracy's summation of the trial is devastatingly correct. The real complainant at the bar is civilization itself as he so eloquently states. No player before or since has ever done so many lengthy speeches in his films and done them so well. This is the best of them, a creed for civilization that we as humans should all live by.In some of the smaller roles take note of some good performances by Virginia Christine as Tracy's housekeeper, Werner Klemperer as the unrepentant Nazi judge, and Howard Caine as Judy Garland's husband who does not want her victimized all over again on the witness stand. A real cross section of the German public circa 1948.Judgment at Nuremberg should be seen back to back with Schindler's List as a portrayal of the brutality itself and how civilization tried to deal with the consequences. Judgement at Nuremberg is a film whose message will never not be timely.",10,6,8,25 November 2006
Heartbreak Ridge," Improvise, Adapt, Overcome
","My favorite Clint Eastwood film is Heartbreak Ridge. Not even in the Dirty Harry films is Clint Eastwood more the Clint Eastwood the movie-going public loves.In this one Clint is a Marine Corps lifer who has come back to his original Fleet Marine unit to train a really ragged bunch of gyrenes who have an attitude. And as we learn had previously been in the care of another lifer who was coasting towards his retirement.Coasting is not in the Eastwood creed, it's not something he ever did in any film he was in. Halfway during the film we learn that he was the winner of the Congressional Medal of Honor back in Vietnam. But that fact has probably kept him from being busted out of the Corps because Eastwood can be pretty nasty and insolent, even to superior officers.The guy he's assigned to, Everett McGill, has a grudge going into the new assignment. Eastwood slugged a superior officer who was a friend of McGill's, an old classmate from Annapolis.Clint's also got a domestic situation, an ex-wife in the person of Marsha Mason. She's working and keeping company with a redneck bar owner, Bo Svenson. I loved Mason's scenes with Eastwood in Heartbreak Ridge, they remind a whole lot of the way John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara behaved in their best pictures.Clint's the man in Heartbreak Ridge. Whether it's Marine Corps regulations, Marine Corps training, Marine Corps politics, the man lives his creed, he overcomes, he improvises he adapts, but always in his own way.Director Eastwood selected a really good supporting cast besides those already mentioned. Really good in their parts are Arlen Dean Snyder as Eastwood's best friend the sergeant-major on the post, Eileen Heckart as the widow of another of Eastwood's Marine Corps friends and his landlady as well and Mario Van Peebles the 'ayatollah of rock and roller'.One part I really liked, my favorite in the supporting cast is that of Boyd Gaines as the young lieutenant who is in charge of Eastwood's platoon. Most people would remember Gaines from his role in the later years of One Day at a Time as Valerie Bertinelli's husband, but I think this should be his career role. He's a callow youth who grows up under pressure and even as an officer comes under Eastwood's tutelage. I like the way he stood up to Everett McGill's browbeating when McGill was trying to throw the book at Clint. Character can be brought out in a lot of ways.The climax of the film is the United States invasion of Grenada to both overthrow a Marxist stooge of Castro and rescue American civilians stranded during an uprising. It was nice to see Eastwood and the rest of our fighting force get the welcome they deserved for a nasty job, well done.And Heartbreak Ridge is a nearly perfect Clint Eastwood, that deserves a well done.",9,1,3,19 January 2008
Salt," The Soviet Shall Rise Again
","Salt finds Angelina Jolie using the high flying techniques of Lara Croft Tomb Raider as a deep cover Soviet espionage agent, that's right Soviet espionage agent who is now working for our Central Intelligence Agency. For those of you who tend to the paranoid this is the film for you.Actually this idea is not new, it was used in the Charles Bronson action flick Telefon and in the Sidney Poitier-River Phoenix film Little Nikita. The idea being that deep, very deep cover, espionage agents were planted here by the Soviet Union to await an assignment whatever it might be. The Soviet Union may be gone, but it is sleeping phoenix like to arise again when folks like Jolie are contacted to do what they were sent here to do. Problem is that Jolie has grown to like America and she's determined to stop the plot which concerns killing the Russian Federation President and starting a nuclear war.If you believe in the deepest of conspiracies, Salt is the film for you. But if you have half the gray cells in working order upstairs, you'll find Salt as ridiculous as I did. You'll laugh as I did in all the wrong places.",4,8,17,3 August 2010
Duck Soup," Enough To Make Anyone A Marxist
","When the Marx Brothers decided to leave Paramount, they did in the words of the old expression leave them laughing. In fact with Duck Soup, they left them rolling in the aisles.Duck Soup is helmed by the greatest director the Brothers ever worked for in their film career, Leo McCarey. He guided this anti-war lampoon of Ruritanian pictures with a sure hand. It's the shortest film the brothers ever did, but there's hardly a minute in it without a gag or three.I think that Leo McCarey had in mind a satire on the Merry Widow, where if you'll recall the plot has the richest widow in Marovia ready to leave the country bag and baggage for Paris. It's up to Count Danilo to woo her for the country. People have done worse for patriotic motives. A silent version by Erich Von Stroheim was already made of The Merry Widow and next year Jeanette MacDonald and Maurice Chevalier would do it for MGM. But here we have Freedonia's richest citizen, Margaret Dumont not willing to underwrite her little country unless she names its prime minister. And of course she names the man wooing her, Groucho Marx. Of course that foils the plans of Louis Calhern, the ambassador from neighboring Sylvania. War eventually breaks out between the two countries over some absurdities you'll have to see to believe.Harpo and Chico play a pair of hapless spies who change loyalties at the turn of a dime and seem to wind up doing more good for whoever they're working against at the moment. They even take time to have a battle with poor Edgar Kennedy. Note that scene in the bathtub with Edgar Kennedy and Harpo, it may be Harpo's best moment from their films.This was Zeppo's last film, he did not make the journey to MGM with his three brothers. I'm not sure too many people noticed because his contribution seem mostly to act as a foil for Groucho's barbs. He became an agent and as a comic he was a good agent.Duck Soup is only 68 minutes long, but you cannot believe how many laughs you can get in a picture that short.",9,6,9,4 December 2007
Apocalypse Now," The horror, The horror
","We have to wait until there is only a quarter of the running time left before Marlon Brando comes on as Colonel Kurtz. But it's worth the wait to see him give a fabulous performance as a decorated US Army Colonel who has gone over the hill and off the deep end.Until that time we watch Martin Sheen as an intelligence officer given an assassination assignment to terminate Brando. Brando as a soldier did his job well, too well maybe. Now he's set himself up with an army of Montagnard tribespeople as some kind of potentate deep in the jungle across into Cambodia where Americans aren't supposed to be in any event.Francis Ford Coppola gave this film almost a surreal quality, it gets more surreal as the PT boat aka swift boat journeys up river to the Kurtz compound. It starts with the real war enough, but even that is a Sam Peckinpah like violence ballet with Robert Duvall replete with western cavalry hat leading a raid on a Viet Cong stronghold at the river mouth with the strains of Wagner's dance of the Valkyries. Duvall loves his aroma of napalm in the morning.I liked the river journey when Sheen sets out on that PT boat with the ever present mist over the river. It has Hitchcock like suspense, you never know what they will encounter and neither do they. You also see what war has done to the crew in that kind of atmosphere never knowing when they might meet death with an enemy who doesn't operate in the traditional ways of war.I was lucky enough to see the Redux version with the sequence of Christian Marquand and his plantation. It was cut for length in the original film, but it's worth seeing now. All of those countries used to be called French Indo-China, still remember it on Atlas maps when I was a lad. He's got his manor house there and it's home to him and nobody is going to push him out. An attitude similar to people who followed Ian Smith in Northern Rhodesia when the rest of Africa was shaking off colonialism. I'm glad the scenes have been restored.Brando is only in briefly, but his performance as the cracker doodle, but perceptive Kurtz is something to see. Also note that Scott Glenn previously sent on Sheen's mission and freelance reporter Dennis Hopper have become Brando acolytes and also standout in their cameos.Apocalypse Now is not the best Vietnam War film. My own preference is Casualties Of War. But it's definitely worth a look.",8,2,5,12 November 2016
The Battle of Algiers," France's illusion
","Told in a brutally realistic style The Battle For Algeria is the ultimate in docudrama. Italian director Gillo Pontecorvo made this film with a bit of distance
between the French-Algerian War post World War II. Pontecorvo skillfully uses
documentary footage to blend in nicely with the story he shot. You think you
are getting an inside look at the war.Looking back this seems so ludicrous. Post the Napoleonic age France's colonial
expansion took her to North Africa just across the Mediterranean and between
Morocco, Tunisia, and the countries carved out of French Equatorial Africa and
French West Africa she had one large chunk of the continent. By degree and
somewhat hurried by the end of World War II. Except for Algeria and particularly Algiers it's capital city on the coast. For some inexplicable reason
the French took a proprietary interest in the place and would not let it go.No hearts and minds were won by the French among the Moslem population.
Especially after use of torture. Why they just didn't let them go with the rest
is beyond me.The Algerian story is told from the point of view of freedom figter Braham
Hadjaji. The French point of view is covered from high ranking officer Jean
Martin. Martin's attitudes are frightening as his sense of propriety concerning
Algiers.This is one great film with a lot of lessons to be learned about neo-colonialism.",8,2,3,7 July 2019
The Patriot," Not Your Real Swamp Fox
","With the name changes of Francis Marion to Benjamin Martins and Banastre Tarleton to William Tavington, director Roland Emmerich was free to take a whole lot of liberty with the southern theater of the American Revolution. If anyone is expecting to see a factual account of what happened in the south from 1779 to 1781 they will be gravely disappointed. Mel Gibson is the Martins/Marion character and the biggest poetic license was taken with that character. Most basic of all Marion is presented as a family man who was a veteran of the French and Indian War and took up arms again when his plantation was sacked and son killed. Francis Marion was a bachelor, he got married and did raise a family after the Revolution was won. But that certainly would have knocked a very large prop out of Gibson's character motivation.Jason Isaacs is the Tavington/Tarleton character and he's every bit as nasty a piece of work as Banastre Tarleton was in real life. The man relished war and killing and believed in waging totally against His Majesty's rebels. The phrase 'Tarleton's Quarter' came into the language after he massacred some colonial troops who had surrendered. He was real big on those kind of atrocities, Governor Thomas Jefferson of Virginia fled with no dignity when he got word that Tarleton's troops were minutes away from Monticello. He knew exactly what the author of The Declaration of Independence would have received at his hands.It would have been poetic and nice if he had met his end during the Revolutionary War, but Tarleton went back to the United Kingdom and took up a seat in Parliament and was a noted defender of slavery and slave interests. You can see him at work doing that in the film Wilberforce which concerns William Wilberforce's campaign to halt the African slave trade.Heath Ledger as Gibson's oldest son and Joely Richardson make a fine pair of eager young people looking eagerly to a new nation dedicated to what Jefferson espoused in The Declaration of Independence. Rene Auberjonois's character of a fighting parson is borrowed from George Bernard Shaw's Reverend Anthony Anderson in The Devil's Disciple.Tom Wilkinson plays Lord Cornwallis and he appears in too many history books to give him a pseudonym. But for some reason Chris Cooper's character who was Cornwallis's opposite number is not called Nathanael Greene. He's one of the most remarkable commanders of the Revolutionary War, a man who never won a battle, but managed to hold the British army completely at bay in the southern theater due in no small part to people like Mel Gibson's Benjamin Martins(Francis Marion). There is mention in the film of General Horatio Gates who fled after the Battle of Charleston which the British totally routed the colonials and took the seaport of Charleston. It was Greene who was brought in to replace the mistakenly highly touted Gates.Francis Marion is sometimes given the credit of starting the use of guerrilla war methods, but that distinction properly should go to Major Robert Rogers during the French and Indian War. Marion certainly was skilled in the art of it as The Patriot shows. As for Rogers he was a Tory in his political beliefs and offered to get a guerrilla outfit going for the Crown, but was not taken up on his offer.The Patriot received Oscar nominations for Best Cinematography, Best Music Score, and Best Sound not winning in any of those categories. But the film deserved those nominations. John Williams in doing the music successfully integrated period songs with some modern themes and the cinematography, especially in the battle scenes showed what combat was like in that era. They were every bit as well done as Ted Turner's Civil War trilogy or Pearl Harbor.The Patriot if not the story Marion and Tarleton who probably never met face to face in real life is still a good depiction of the issues surrounding the American Revolution.",8,1,9,12 December 2010
Edward Scissorhands," The Gentle Frankenstein
","In case no one has noticed it actor Johnny Depp and director Tim Burton have collaborated on six joint projects, certainly enough to qualify them as a screen team like Wayne and Ford and DeNiro and Scorsese. But in my humble opinion they have not topped Edward Scissorhands their first and best work together.I think the part of Edward Scissorhands, the gentle Frankenstein like creation of Vincent Price, was Johnny Depp's real breakout role. Around this time Depp was at a real critical point in his career. He was a teenage idol due to his role on 21 Jump Street, but he had it in his head he could do some really serious work. It would have been easy to go with the flow and stayed with the series a few more years and make a pile of money. Sad to say though once teenage idols lose their vehicles very few have careers of the first rank, no matter how talented they are. Instead Johnny Depp remained true to himself and confident in his abilities and it paid off. This role was so unlike what he had done before and his is a career that keeps reinventing itself with every film. This was his first reinvention and it remains my favorite film of his.Edward Scissorhands is a fable like a modern Grimm fairy tale with nods of acknowledgment to Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and Peter Sellers character in Being There. Edward is a creation like the Frankenstein monster, but it's no criminal brain that's commanding his body. He's as innocent as a babe, a real live boy, but with a pair of hands made from garden clippers, sharp as a razor. His inventor Vincent Price died before giving him human hands leaving an innocent with what could be deadly weapons.His innocence is preserved when Dianne Weist the Avon Lady from the neighborhood goes to the Gothic house that looms over her neat suburban pastel neighborhood. I've got to hand it to Tim Burton for those pastel suburban sets showing the stultifying conformity, contrasting to Vincent Price's place. The shots of the ordinary suburban types doing their daily thing say more than 100 pages of dialog.Weist takes him home, Depp has survived in the place, God only knows how. She seeks to integrate him into life. Those scissorhands prove to be quite popular as he sculpts designs in the suburban hedges, and then goes into hairdressing where he works at a fantastic pace.Depp's as innocent as Peter Sellers let out into the real world in being there. But said to say it all works out like it did for Boris Karloff in Frankenstein.Besides those I've already mentioned, pay note to the performances of Winona Ryder as Weist's daughter, Anthony Michael Hall as her jock boyfriend whose jealousy starts Edward's world unraveling and Kathy Baker who stepped out of Desperate Housewives for her role. This was Vincent Price's farewell performance on the big screen. He did one more made for television film and then after he died a cartoon version of Arabian Nights which was shelved for 20 years was released. In the Citadel Film series book, The Films of Vincent Price, Johnny Depp paid a fine tribute to Price saying he was a wonderful man to work with and a real inspiration. Price also gave him some good financial advice. Buy art as the best hedge against inflation in hard times. And Vincent Price certainly knew his art.With all these fine people in it, the film is owned body and soul by Johnny Depp. His performance in which his dialog is kept to a minimum due to the character is an object lesson of how much emotion one can convey with both lack of dialog and heavy makeup. Speaking of which the only Oscar this film was nominated for was in the Makeup category and it lost to Warren Beatty's Dick Tracy. How Johnny Depp didn't get a nomination at least is a disgrace.You watch Edward Scissorhands and I recommend you watch it as a triple feature with Frankenstein and Being There and it will blow you away.",10,2,4,15 July 2009
Silver Linings Playbook," Tiffany and Pat, two volatile people
","Watching Silver Linings Playbook tonight I got the feeling that the parts of the film good as they are did not add up to a perfect whole. Still the film has a lot to recommend it. After all it did get eight Oscar nominations from last year including one each in all the acting categories. And an Oscar for Jennifer Lawrence for Best Actress. Bradley Cooper, nominated for Best Actor plays a husband who just did a stint in a mental hospital for beating the living daylights out of his wife's lover. All three were teachers at the same high school in South Philadelphia and that must have had the faculty and students gossiping for a year.Jacki Weaver and Robert DeNiro play Cooper's parents and both were nominated in the Supporting players category for both sexes. Weaver had her son released in her custody without telling DeNiro who accepts the situation for peace at home. He's got his own issues, he's a degenerate gambler who drives Weaver to wit's end.Some friends try to fix up Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence on the theory that two volatile people could help heal each other. Lawrence's issues stem from the death of her husband a Philadelphia cop. Although there is an attraction for them, both their joint volatility and Cooper's refusal to give up trying to win back his wife are obstacles.All those things plus DeNiro's gambling habit combine in one interesting climax where the growing relationship of Cooper and Lawrence plus DeNiro's finances are on the line. I dare not say more.Some nice location cinematography also distinguishes Silver Linings Playbook. Having visited Philadelphia a few times I recognized quite a bit of it. We get to see quite a bit of South Philadelphia where it seems everyone knows everyone and everyone's business.Both Cooper and Lawrence come across as decent and three dimensional people trying to cope as best they can with mental illness. Lawrence just lights up the screen with her performance. I didn't see the other nominated roles, but they would have had to go some to beat her out for the Oscar and apparently didn't.My main criticism of an otherwise fine film is that I see no silver linings for either main character. They'll have to do a lot to make the relationship work if they can. Still Silver Linings Playbook is a wonderful film deservedly honored with all those nominations and Jennifer Lawrence's Oscar.",8,2,3,7 March 2013
Divergent," The Five Factions
","In a futuristic society the population is divided into castes based on aptitude tests. The names should give you an idea of what direction the people are led into. Erudite, Candor, Amity, Abegnation, and the warrior caste Dauntless. It's this caste that is the defender of the established order. Of course there's a lot of folks out there who are casteless, didn't make the grade in any caste and now are something along the lines of the Hindu untouchable. But the rarest of all are those people whose intelligence quotient is so high they can test into any category. They are called Divergent and the established order fears them because they can move chameleon like into any faction.Shailene Woodley is such a Divergent, but she's taught to mask it well. To the surprise of many she chooses Dauntless and goes into basic training for Dauntless far more rigorous for this Spartan group than the others. Woodley also discovers a plot to turn this warrior society into some kind of Fascistic tool and this is where the action truly starts.An interesting idea if not entirely carried out successfully testing for whatever virtues one possesses for your role in society. The great unwashed out there who don't fit in are accounted for. What seems to be missing here is an account for those bad character flaws just where do they go. I suspect they are the villains of the piece but a society as advanced as should test out those people as well.Woodley makes a nice and earnest lead supported by fellow Dauntless member Theo James a young man who sees what Dauntless is being subverted into. Also note Kate Winslet who is one of the subverters.Divergent is a nice if not entirely successful portrait of a futuristic society.",6,0,0,27 September 2014
Ender's Game," The life of Earth depends on gaming skills
","After all the controversy surrounding the author of Ender's Game and his iconoclastic views on so many subjects, I quite frankly didn't know what to expect from this film. It's far from the greatest science fiction endeavor I've ever seen. It really ought to be seen back to back with Starship Troopers on a number of levels.In both cases the earth has been subject to an alien invasion of an insect civilization of sorts. Starship Troopers never has any doubts or qualms about the citizen's exercising their right to defend planet earth from the bug invasion. The insects aren't even given a generic name, they're simply referred to as 'bugs'. And the bugs only see earth as some kind of feeding ground.These insects in Ender's Game are called Formi and they invaded and several million people were killed before the invasion was repelled. But they've been quiet over the last several decades, no one can say for certainty what they're intentions are. But earth isn't waiting, Harrison Ford is in charge of developing young and I do mean young new commanders with computer precision skills, honed to perfection on computer games.The one he favors is young Asa Butterfield who seems to have more of the right stuff than anyone else. In the end as you would imagine he does, but what he does raises certain issues that Starship Troopers would never imagine.It's ironic that the biggest strength of Ender's Game is the way that computer gaming skills have been refined and are so desirable. The Armed Forces in its recruiting for several years has made a selling point of gaming skills. All the weapons from the most sophisticated missiles down to tanks and even some hand held weapons have a computer guidance system of sorts. No more just point, aim, and shoot. Ender's Game has multiplied that exponentially. In fact in this futuristic society, one with the requisite skills can be drafted.In the end a mixed message is sent to the audience robbing some of the effectiveness of Ender's Game. It still has a lot to recommend it and the contrast to Starship Troopers is quite intense.",6,2,8,5 November 2013
Jarhead," Trained for war
","Jarhead is based n the memoirs of the real Anthony Swofford and his time in the
United States Marines. Jake Gyllenhaal. When you're trained for war the hardest
thing sometimes to do is stand and wait.Which was what back in the early 90s the Marines and the rest of the coalition sat
and waited in Saudi Arabia for about 6 months. Days when being cool meant
the temperature was only in double digits fahrenheit.Gyllenhaal is not the most gung ho marine out there. In fact during basic he
scrapes by. But the man can shoot and Sergeant Jamie Foxx thinks he would
be good for special sniper training.Gyllenhaal is something of an intellectual and a Marine barracks is not a place
where one usually finds them. But the memoirs of Anthony Swofford in this
time provide a nice insight into these troops trained for war and finding no
outlet.Jarhead might be the film concerning Desert Shield and Desert Storm.",7,0,0,25 June 2019
Dunkirk," The Citizens Mobilize
","Dunkirk played a small part of that classic from the World War II years Mrs. Miniver. If you remember Walter Pidgeon took his small craft out and said he would be returning the next day. You then see his boat joining other small craft and then there's an armada of them heading down the Thames and out to sea. They were heading for Dunkirk and were going right up to the beaches where the large naval vessels couldn't go and taking several hundred thousand British soldiers and a few French who later became the basis for the Free French army headed by Charles DeGaulle.There's's mention here of Winston Churchill and Sir Bertram Ramsey whom I believe was First Sea Lord. The only criticism I have of Dunkirk is that I would like to have had some scenes with the top decision makers as we saw in such films as Patton, MacArthur, The Longest Day, the Battle Of Britain, and others. Especially in The Longest Day we saw the ordinary soldiers and their story mixed with the brass and the critical decisions they were making.On the plus side Dunkirk is a film wonderfully cast with several poignant stories about what was being done and the sacrifices made. My favorite is that of young Barry Keoghan all of 17 who comes on the small craft of Tom Rylance and his son Tom Glynn-Carney just to be part of a great adventure. His performance will bring a few tears to the eye. Of all in the film I hope young Mr. Keoghan will get some notice for a Supporting Actor Oscar.No doubt Dunkirk is in line for some technical awards as well in addition to the big one. With 10 now in the race for Best Picture I have no doubt that Dunkirk will be one of the ten.I've always loved the story of Dunkirk and how that island nation put aside its differences among the subjects and worked together to get that army off the beach. Make no mistake this was citizen mobilization at its finest. No matter what your views were unless you were an out and out Nazi sympathizer you knew what getting those troops home meant.Nothing less than the fate of civilization itself.",9,7,17,27 July 2017
Cross of Iron," 'The German Soldier fights to stay alive'
","Sam Peckinpah did a real classic war film with Cross Of Iron. The little known and
covered eastern front of World War 2 is covered here. And the attitude is best
expressed by lead character James Coburn who says quite candidly the only
motivation the German soldier has to fight at this point is to stay alive.Into Coburn's life on the Russian front comes Maximilian Schell a transfer from
Southern France where so far he's had a nice and easy war. But Schell is not a
Nazi per se, but he is part of that Prussian aristocracy which runs the army and
made it's bed with Hitler before the war. As a matter of pride he wants to earn
an iron cross like everyone else in his militarist family.The problem is he wants Coburn to testify to his activity in repelling a Russian
assault. Coburn won't lie for him so Schell puts him in a position Uriah the
Hittite would have found familiar.Cross Of Iron gives us one of James Coburn's top performances on the big
screen. The battle scenes as created by Peckinpah are outstanding. Schell
matches Coburn with his performance and there's a good one by James Mason
as a more realistic German general than those he reports to back in Berlin.Those of us who watch the MeTV channel or remember Hogan's Heroes from
the 50s remember that famous gag about being sent to the Russian front for
any infractions of Nazi rules and etiquette. Cross Of Iron shows us how this
indeed was no joke to those who went there.",8,1,2,13 February 2019
Bad Teacher," Cameron And Her Boob Job
","Bad Teacher is a comedy about one who is precisely that and the title role is played by Cameron Diaz. She thinks she's through with teaching, but a bad breakup convinces her that she needs a little frontal enhancement to get the man of her dreams. But cosmetic surgery doesn't come cheap so it's back to work and at a teacher's salary it won't be easy. Remember her insurance won't cover it.Diaz is the kind of teacher that you don't learn much from, but does give those junior high school boys a lot of wet and sleepless nights. But when she finds out that a $5700.00 bonus will come with a class that has the best scholastic achievement, it provides a powerful motive for her to actually teach and cut a few corners.In the meantime Diaz has to deal with fellow teachers Justin Timberlake and Jason Segal who both thinks her measurements are just fine as they are. She also has to watch for Lucy Punch who plays a popular teacher looking to nail her in a scandal. Punch has some of the best moments in this film, she apparently modeled her character on the happy homemaker character Betty White created on the Mary Tyler Moore Show back in the day. Jillian Armenante best known for being on the Judging Amy Show a few years back plays Diaz's confidante among the teachers.Bad Teacher was an interesting idea for a film that didn't quite make it. It has some good moments, but I never could develop a rooting interest as to whether Cameron gets her money for that boob enhancement. In fact males of junior high school and high school age will like Bad Teacher, but I think it will fall flat among adults.",4,4,11,15 July 2011
54," Playground of the elite
","Once upon a time in the not too distant past a man named Steve Rubell who to look at in this film and in real life was not all that much decided to create a playground where only the elite could participate. Two criteria decided who was among the elite, power and beauty. Rubell courted the powerful and selected only the beautiful. He created Studio 54 on West 54 Street in Manhattan and people would beg to be admitted. I was actually in the place once, not on charm, beauty, or personality mind you, but for a political fundraiser when it was rented out.One who got in on sheer beauty in this film was New Jersey kid Ryan Phillippe and it is through his eyes that the story of 54 unfolds. And we see Mike Myers as Steve Rubell who reveled in the company of the powerful and beautiful, indulged in all the vices, and stole from his own business like the wise guys in Goodfellas used to rob the cargo shipments at JFK Airport like it was an ATM. Missing from the story is his partner Ian Schrager, still very much with us, still very much a power player. It's for that reason he is missing, but it renders 54 inaccurate from the start.Phillippe has no problem using his looks and body to get all the sex he wants and to advance himself and establish. It's the main lesson he learns from Myers. What he sees as an ultimate goal in life, is something in the end he rejects.Myers is fascinating and repellent at the same time. You've got to wonder why people would curry favors from this man, but in point of fact it happened. You know where he's headed and 54 makes you want to see him fall, at the same time you wish you could be part of the 54 scene.Selma Hayek and Breckin Mayer play a couple who work at 54, a married couple who take Phillippe in. The hedonist atmosphere puts a strain on their marriage like few others are tested. Also Neve Campbell, a soap actress who is from New Jersey like Phillippe is also an ambitious woman who teaches Phillippe a thing or two. They all register well.In the end though 54 is in the joint custody of both Ryan Phillippe and Mike Myers. This was Phillippe's breakthrough part and Myers is not in this role a part of Wayne's World or Austin Powers. No this is the story of a self indulgent man who had a heady ride and a tremendous fall.",7,1,1,5 February 2014
Dallas Buyers Club," 'Remember it's a business'
","Dallas Buyers Club is a film about those rough days in the middle 80s during the heights of the AIDS epidemic. I lived in New York City in those days and for two decades lost innumerable friends and loved ones to this plague which attacked the human body's immune system. The plague started in New York and San Francisco and both cities with a large LGBT population which had its struggles with indifference in government, but generally had the good will of the populace. That was what would become the heart of blue state America.But this story as its title says takes place in the heart of the reddest of states. Matthew McConaughey is an electrician and part time rodeo bull rider who lives a swinging lifestyle of unprotected sex and liberal drug use. Ways certainly we know AIDS can be acquired, but back then the religious right hawked for it was worth that AIDS was the 'gay disease'. Just stop being gay and AIDS will cease, no need for government reaction to the epidemic.McConaughey starts out thinking exactly that way, he can't conceive that a good Ole Boy like himself could get a disease reserved for homosexuals. His friends think the same way and pretty soon he's shunned by his fellow rednecks. But after he's told that he has maybe 30 days to live, that's something he just won't accept. He also research's promising drugs and non- pharmaceutical remedies to deal with the virus. He's fought every step of the way by the pharmaceutical establishment because as we are told by Dr. Denis O'Hare it is a business first and foremost.McConaughey is nothing if not resourceful. In the process he acquires a whole new set of friends including his doctor Jennifer Garner and a transsexual AIDS patient Jared Leto. McConaughey finds that fighting the disease takes a lot more fortitude than riding bulls. His evolution of mindset is what got him his Best Actor Oscar.Jared Leto received a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for transforming himself in just about every way possible. The contrast between McConaughey and Leto is also a lot of what drives Dallas Buyers Club. Leto's homosexuality and cross dressing have alienated him from his wealthy family. He keeps feeding his drug habit, having a lot of unprotected sex because even if he's cured he feels he has no reason to live and no one to care about him, not even family. Family rejection is a powerful thing to overcome, a lot can't do it. I've seen enough in my own life with people I know and still know in terms of family rejection. It's the biggest obstacle, the fear of family rejection to coming out. Leto shows how real that fear is and how some just can't deal with it. So many broken bodies because of the disease have broken souls within. Unless you are a hardcore Tea Party follower you will be moved to tears by what Leto does with the part.Besides those Oscars, makeup naturally won an Oscar both for Leto's and McConaughey's transformation to diseased people. It's also a testimony to the dedication of so many AIDS activists even those who came from strange places like Matthew McConaughey's character.",9,1,1,24 March 2014
The Fast and the Furious," Fast Cars And Those Who Drive Them
","I had just come from a rather desultory day at the movies where I saw the sequel Fast & Furious to this film. I had written in the review that you probably would have had to see the first film in order to fully appreciate what was going on. Wouldn't you know it, the FX channel was broadcasting this tonight. I was partially correct, but this film had a bit more plot to it and didn't concentrate on just the special effects and the violence which was served up fast and furious. Vin Diesel is a criminal who races cars as an avocation and does hijackings for a living. The FBI wants him, the LAPD wants him and Paul Walker is an LAPD cop gone undercover to get him.Walker takes his assignment quite literally and part of getting undercover is under some blankets with Diesel's sister Jordana Brewster and getting it on with the young lady. But he also proves his driving abilities to Diesel.Diesel's racing rivals are some Asian gangbangers headed by Rick Yune and Walker would dearly like to pin something on them. Still it's Diesel his superiors want and it's Diesel they will have come what may.Paul Walker compromised his effectiveness as an undercover agent thoroughly in this film. In fact at the beginning of the sequel it is remarked that he's lucky to still be holding a job. Makes for some rather unbelievable viewing.But fans of fast cars and those who drive them will definitely like The Fast And The Furious.",5,3,7,9 April 2009
Gandhi," Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi.........1869-1948
","Films do not come any better than this. The impact of this singular life is still being felt in the world. This man of peace who toppled a mighty empire and caused it to leave his country. Many study his teachings, most importantly the Reverend Martin Luther King for the civil rights movement in America, not enough follow them, especially in Gandhi's own corner of the world. His monument is now a growing and prosperous India that is slowly eradicating poverty form its borders. Gandhi would approve of that, he was not just for independence for the sake of independence, he was deeply interested in the kind of society that would result after the British left India. India's growing prosperity would please him, the religious and ethnic struggles still prevalent in that part of the world would not.The problem in discussing a film like Gandhi is that discussions will overlap into the life of the subject as opposed to the quality of the film. Richard Attenborough having lived a lot of his life during the time when these events took place remembered them well. He's got an eye for the sweep and grandeur of the story, but the life of Gandhi here is never overwhelmed by the spectacle of the film. And Ben Kingsley's Gandhi dominates the film, no wonder he received his Oscar for Best Actor. Ironically enough one of his competitors was Paul Newman who got a nomination for The Verdict which I consider his best performance and my personal favorite of his films. For me to say Kingsley deserved it over him is quite an admission.Gandhi was a devout Hindhu, but he was a man of vision who saw some of the injustices of fundamentalist and exclusionary religious beliefs. Born in the Brahmin caste, he fought against the caste system where social status was stratified by religion in ancient times and people could not rise from it. He was a believer in a land of opportunity, careers that were open to talent. He also was against male domination and treated women as equals. Note that scene where after he's arrested the British soldier offers to take Mrs. Gandhi to shelter, but says she will make the same seditious speech her husband intended to make and they might as well arrest her too.Of the many varied roles in the film by British and Indian players and a couple of Americans as well, the one that really stands out was Edward Fox as General Dyer. Some of the violence during our civil rights struggles in the American south was nothing compared to the Amritsar massacre when as the British commander he opened fire on a peaceful rally and slaughtered hundreds of men, women, and children. We put Nazis to death for atrocities committed in World War II, yet little happened to Dyer except he was put on the shelf and buried like an embarrassment which he certainly was. Fox in that small role captured the haughty military mind and cold blooded ruthlessness that one has to be born with.The ironic thing is that after India did send troops to fight in various theaters in World War I the Indians, Moslems, Hindus, et al, expected independence. They thought it would be peaceful, but Amritsar made revolutionaries of a lot of people. And the sentiment in the British population was for independence. But some politicians like Winston Churchill and press barons like Lord Beaverbrooke whipped up a lot of fear in the Tory ranks for granting independence. It was a stupid and incredibly shortsighted opinion that we still feel the effects of today.Gandhi won several Oscars besides Kingsley's including Best Picture for 1982 and Best Director for Richard Attenborough. The best review I can give Gandhi is that the film is great and worthy of the great man in portrays.",10,3,5,5 February 2011
Ocean's Eleven," Crackerjack caper
","I imagine that followers of the legend of the Clan would find it unforgivable
that George Clooney remade the ultimate Rat Pack film Ocean's 11. But I
think even Frank, Dean, and Sammy would be happy with what Clooney and
director Steven Soderbergh did with it. It's nothing less than a crackerjack
caper film with a few stars to gaze at also.The point in the original is that this was a film almost made as a lark for the
participants while the main players were appearing at the legendary Sands
Resort in Las Vegas. These were old army ranger buddies who decide to put their training to use and heist five casinos.Clooney and buddy Brad Pitt's film has them in the Frank and Dean roles and they're a much more professional outfit who are only doing one of them. But it's the one Andy Garcia owns and Clooney has a score to settle
with him. He's taken Clooney's wife away played here ever so briefly by
Julia Roberts. In the original Angie Dickinson had the part. And it was also
a brief part.Clooney and Pitt go out and recruit a crack team, some they know, some they don't. But it's a professional job and close run thing.Garcia is in a part the equivalent of George Raft from the original. It was 
business for Raft and business for Cesar Romero the syndicate guy he hires
to find them. But Garcia's a nasty character who settles his own accounts.The film has got a whole lot of nice touches stylistically and cast is expensive and first rate. For those familiar with the original the irony of that ending is replaced by something completely different. More in keeping
with George Clooney than Frank Sinatra.Nevertheless I think the Chairman of the Board would like this Ocean's Eleven.",7,3,4,7 January 2018
Duck You Sucker," 'Hey Firecracker'
","Duck, You Sucker which is the title of this film that I first saw it under takes place in revolutionary Mexico of the teen years of the last century. It's a time we've become somewhat familiar with in America due to films like Viva Zapata and any number of films about Pancho Villa. This film is not quite as good as Viva Zapata however.It's from the guy who made the spaghetti western and Clint Eastwood popular in the USA, Sergio Leone and stars Rod Steiger and James Coburn and a cast of unknown Europeans mostly Italian. Coburn plays an Irish Revolutionary who's finding things a bit hot over in Ireland with His Majesty's Home Office breathing down hard in search of him. He's an explosives expert, hence the name Steiger gives him of firecracker. Coburn is almost, not quite as laconic as when he was in The Magnificent Seven and was the one with the least amount of dialog.That's all right because Steiger more than makes up for it. I'm sure Rod wasn't given all that much direction by Leone as to character. So he does the next best thing, he bellows his way through the film when he's not dispatching members of the upper classes into the next world with abandon. The two form an unlikely partnership and strike many a blow for liberation of the masses before one of them is killed. And they do look like they're having fun while doing it.There's nothing much more to tell about Duck, You Sucker. It's got the same look and feel as all those Clint Eastwood films Leone did. In fact that's my main problem, the man is great at creating atmosphere and does wonders with a camera. But he's no actor's director. It's why his films are so short on words.But I'm one who thinks Italians ought to stick to grand opera as the art form they do best because it's their culture and leave westerns to Americans. But some folks like Sergio Leone and if you do I'm sure you'll like Duck, You Sucker more than me.",5,6,14,1 October 2008
Tropic Thunder," Blood And Guts And Agents
","Though the satire is heavy handed at times, there is still enough to get some really good laughs from Tropic Thunder, Ben Stiller and Justin Theroux's salute to blood and guts war films.I think Stiller and Theroux got their idea for this film from The Three Amigos. If you'll remember three Hollywood silent western stars are transported to Mexico which if you'll remember was in one anarchic state during the teen years of the last century. What we have here is a few actors who are doing a Vietnam War movie in Vietnam giving the director and producer all kinds of grief with their various hangups. What to do is set them down in total isolation in the jungle with cameras and explosive devices.Unfortunately that part of the jungle is now the turf of some nasty drug dealers who are intrepid actors have to do some real battle with. Especially after they capture one of them, Ben Stiller, and the ransom they demand from the producers ain't forthcoming.The best gag in the film is Tom Cruise and the hilarious portrayal he gives in an unbilled role. I can't say more because that is the whole point of the joke. Tropic Thunder could have stood some improvement, but I laughed pretty good in the theater. The film is also politically incorrect as all get out as you will discover in Robert Downey, Jr.'s part.",6,4,9,14 August 2008
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," The World Awaits
","I give Scott Pilgrim a seven rating for its technical virtuosity and for the appeal of its youthful cast. It's a movie strictly for the MTV generation of which I am most certainly not part.Having the film be based on a comic book character certainly allows you not to be bound by rules of reality and if this film is one thing, it has no rules. Giving a lengthy explanation of the plot would be a waste of time, but simply young Scott Pilgrim lives in a communal type dwelling where he plays in a rock band and hopes for a musical career. But before he can have that he'd better get out from under the girl friend problems he's having. A young Chinese Catholic school girl played by Ellen Wong is the current one he's dating. But Scott's got exes and the exes have exes and they're all for one reason or another bad at him. Before the film is over he has to deal with issues involving them all.Michael Cera from Canada plays Scott and the film was shot in Toronto, another example of Canadian product mainstreaming right here into the American market. Cera is quirky and appealing in his own way. I did like Kieran Culkin as Scott's gay roommate and Brandon Routh as the action film star who is an ex of a Scott ex. I admire the work more than I like it. But I'm first to concede that that's me, an old fashioned fellow regarding music who thinks Bing Crosby was our greatest performer. I think the MTV generation should enjoy Scott Pilgrim vs. The World.",7,4,21,14 August 2010
The Usual Suspects," A Gang Formed During A Police Lineup
","Five hoodlums are hauled into a police station in a dragnet roundup of The Usual Suspects that are brought in for questioning when something big breaks. Good chance any one or all could have been involved. If you remember in the film The Brink's Job, there is a scene where within a day a lot of Boston's known hoodlums are brought in for questioning. The dragnet brought in Stephen Baldwin, Bernicio DelToro, Kevin Spacey, Gabriel Byrne, and Kevin Pollak. From this motley crew a gang is born.Flash forward to several years later when there is a horrific fire on board a freighter where there has been a gun battle with many deaths. Kevin Spacey managed to survive along with two others of the freighter crew and is being questioned in the police station by US Customs Agent Chazz Palmenteri and LA cop Dan Hedaya.After a couple of other jobs, this crew winds up working for a criminal mastermind from the Balkans who is known as Keyser Sose who is known to be so ruthless that the criminal population itself is scared to death. This guy is spoken of like he was Satan himself and of course the police want him big time also.I can't say much more because the plotting of The Usual Suspects is so intricate and filled with unexpected twists that to spoil this film would be a crime itself. Some here like Stephen Baldwin give their best performances on screen. Kevin Spacey won his first Oscar, this one in the Best Supporting Actor category. The category has me stumped because it's his character that's the key to the whole film. The other Oscar The Usual Suspects won was for Christopher McQuarrie for one highly original Screenplay.The Usual Suspects has enough action for those who crave that, especially when we do see the final battle on that freighter and it's also some highly literate dialog for those who appreciate that. It's best compared to that granddaddy of all caper films The Asphalt Jungle, it's that good.",9,7,12,25 March 2009
The Dirty Dozen," 'Feed the French, Kill the Germans'
","John Wayne who apparently was offered the part of Major Reisman probably wisely turned it down. Wayne would never have done in the part of the maverick major in charge of training the way Lee Marvin was so perfect in the role. In fact Marvin's and the performance of others in the cast helped The Dirty Dozen get over two very big improbable situations I have always found in this film.The first one being the way the conflict between Robert Ryan and Lee Marvin is handled. I can certainly see why a spit and polish West Point graduate like Ryan would not like Marvin, why Marvin would rub him the wrong way. But I cannot understand why when the Dozen are transferred to his command for parachute training they don't tell him what's going on. I would think he would have a need to know. Then again a whole big part of the film wouldn't have occurred if Ryan had been let in on Marvin's mission.The second thing is that granted these guys might be considered expendable to say the least with several of the dozen scheduled for a firing squad, but the army would want to make sure the mission had some chance of succeeding. There's no way, absolutely no bloody way, that a psychotic like Telly Savalas would have been allowed on the mission. And why Lee Marvin didn't scrub him when psychiatrist Ralph Meeker offered to is beyond me as well.Those glaring holes in the story have always prevented me from giving The Dirty Dozen the top rating that most have given it. But it hasn't prevented me from enjoying the film.The basic idea of the film appeals to me. An unorthodox major taking a group of nonconformists to say the least and making them a crack fighting outfit. Regular army training did not do it for this crew the first time around.Charles Bronson is one of the dozen and this film certainly put him well on the way to top billing. A dozen years later in fact he'd have it over Lee Marvin in Death Hunt. Jim Brown also having just finished his football career began his movie career with a winning performance as another of the dozen. John Cassavetes was singled out for a Best Supporting Actor nomination. Also Donald Sutherland got his first real notice as yet another of the dozen.A year later William Holden and Cliff Robertson did The Devil's Brigade which bore a lot of resemblance to The Dirty Dozen. It got slammed by critics for ripping off from The Dirty Dozen. The only problem was that Holden's film was based on a real outfit and The Dirty Dozen is pure fiction. Only in movieland.Marvin's mission is to infiltrate and kill a lot of the German high command as they gather at a French ch√¢teau in the weeks before D-Day. How he does is something you have to watch The Dirty Dozen before. But I think you'll like seeing what happens.",7,34,45,7 April 2007
Gone with the Wind," Scarlett's So High Spirited And Vivacious
","Before I ever saw Gone With the Wind, I was well acquainted with Max Steiner's theme. It opened WOR TV's Million Dollar Movie before every broadcast in New York in the Fifties and Sixties. When my parents took me to see Gone With the Wind in one of MGM's re-releases as the film music started in my youthful eagerness to show off my knowledge I remarked to all who could hear that that was stolen from Million Dollar Movie.Million Dollar Movie is gone now, but Gone With the Wind, book and film, remain eternal. In these days Margaret Mitchell's southern point of view book might have trouble finding a publisher, let alone selling film rights to the story. But it is a tribute to her and the characters she created that they remain alive in everyone's mind who reads the novel or sees the film. And that's just about the same because I can't think of another film that remained so faithful to the text.It is said that Margaret Mitchell wrote the book with Clark Gable in mind as Rhett Butler. As the sober and ever realistic, but charming Rhett, Gable for most of the film is playing a character not to dissimilar from what he usually played on screen. However in the last half hour of the film when he's hit with unbelievable tragedy and he edges to the point of madness, Gable reached dimensions he never did before or subsequently. If Mitchell knew who she wanted as Rhett, nobody knew who would be Scarlett. The search for Scarlett O'Hara is one of those Hollywood legends as every actress with the possible exception of Edna May Oliver read for the part. Gone With the Wind started filming without a Scarlett as the famous burning of Atlanta sequence was done first. While it was being down, David O. Selznick settled on a fairly unknown British actress, at least in the USA, Vivien Leigh.It was a stroke of casting genius. Vivien Leigh's screen output is pretty small, she was primarily a stage actress. Gone With the Wind is more her film than Rhett Butler's. The story is her story, how she evolved from a flighty young southern belle to a hardbitten woman who is determined to survive in the style of living she's become accustomed to from the pre-Civil War era. In the process she helps all those around her economically, but loses all their previous affection. I've always felt the key scene in the film is after Leslie Howard tells Leigh, he'll be marrying Olivia DeHavilland and Leigh makes a fool of herself with him, she finds out that Clark Gable has overheard the whole thing. He's fascinated by her, but because of that he's on to all her ploys.Leslie Howard usually comes in for the smallest amount of analysis among the four leads. His Ashley Wilkes is not all that different from Alan Squire in The Petrified Forest. Imagine Squire as a wealthy plantation owner and you've Ashley. He's stronger than he realizes though, he's the one that reluctantly enlists in the Confederate Army while the cynical Rhett Butler makes some big bucks as a blockade runner.I've always felt however that the most difficult acting job in Gone With the Wind was the role of Melanie Hamilton. Olivia DeHavilland after initially considering trying out for Scarlett, decided to go after Melanie. It's a deceptive part, superficially it's a lot like the crinoline heroines DeHavilland was doing at Warner Brothers. Melanie is the counterpoint to Scarlett, an incredibly kind and decent soul who can't see bad in anyone. One of her best scenes is with Ona Munson who is Belle Watling, the most prominent madam in Atlanta. The other women of society snub her, but DeHavilland accepts her help for the Confederate cause. It's not about politics or slavery for Melanie, her husband is at war and his cause is her's.And DeHavilland's death scene would move the Medusa to tears. It's a great tribute to the playing skill of Olivia DeHavilland in that Melanie NEVER becomes a maudlin character. She got her first Oscar nomination for Melanie in the Supporting Actress category, but lost it to fellow cast member Hattie McDaniel as Scarlett's mammy.Hattie's a shrewd judge of character, she's a slave, but she's also a family confidante of the O'Haras. As Gable says, she's one of the few people he knows whose respect he wants.Of course Gone With the Wind is from the southern point of view. Growing up in Atlanta, Margaret Mitchell heard reminisces from many Confederate veterans and the stories they told found their way into Gone With the Wind. It's about what the white civilian population endured during the war and Reconstruction.David O. Selznick got a bit of irony in there though. Please note during the burning of Atlanta the slaves who are being marched out to dig trenches are singing 'Let My People Go.' And that's just what the Union Army was coming to Atlanta to do.Gone With the Wind copped so many Oscars for 1939 that Bob Hope quipped at the Academy Awards ceremony that it was a benefit for David O. Selznick. Of course it was the Best Picture of 1939 and Vivien Leigh won the first of her two Best Actress Awards.Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer kept itself in the black for years by simply re-releasing Gone With the Wind. Unlike any other classic film, it won new generations of fans with theatrical re-release. Somewhere on this planet there are people seeing this 67 year old classic and it is winning new fans as I write this.And I think Gone With the Wind, the telling of the interwoven lives of Rhett, Scarlett, Ashley, and Melanie and the world they knew, will be something viewed and read hundreds of years from now.",10,104,126,21 October 2006
Legends of the Fall," Ludlow Family Values
","I have to say that the Oscar winning cinematography just blew me away in Legends Of The Fall. With British Columbia standing in for Montana of the early
20th century it's not called The Big Sky country for nothing. My guess though
is Montana now is a bit too developed now to get the proper feel for atmosphere
in which Anthony Hopkins raised his three boys all of whom turned out quite
different. The three sons in Legends Of The Fall are Aidan Quinn, Brad Pitt, and Henry
Thomas chronologically. Quinn is the solid and reliable eldest who becomes
one of Montana's Representatives in Congress. They usually had and still have
only two of them. Henry Thomas can't get out from under being the baby of
the family. The other two are constantly looking out for him.It's Brad Pitt as the middle son who is our brooding protagonist and the closest
thing Pitt ever did on screen as a romantic idol. Brad's like something out of
one of those romance novels. The brothers start showing their differences when Henry Thomas brings home
Julia Ormond as his intended bride. She gets all their hormones in overdrive
and when Thomas fails to return from World War I the rivalry between Pitt
and Quinn drives the rest of the film.Anthony Hopkins who served in the Indian wars in the cavalry was disillusioned
by said conflicts and built his own empire where the native Indians share in its
bounty. His kids however grew up in the era of Theodore Roosevelt where you answered your country's call no matter what. And like TR all three Ludlow
boys are imbued with the idealism of the Allied cause. All three go to Canada
and enlist in their army and defy their father. It all becomes a Greek tragedy of sorts in the end.The Oscar winning cinematography is just breathtaking. The vastness of God's
earth will dazzle the viewer and you might become an instant conservationist.
Legends Of The Fall also won an Oscar for Art&Set Design which is also wonderful and I think that TR's Sagamore Hill might have been a model used.Sad though that Hopkins, Pitt, Quinn, and Ormond got no Oscar recognition 
for this film. Even watching it on television without the big screen Legends Of
The Fall still blows me away.",9,4,6,3 February 2018
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Hero Worship Turns Sour
","Though Jesse James through the newspaper accounts of his exploits and through the dime novels of the day was already a legend, his immortality was sealed on April 3, 1882 by the manner of his death. The lengthy title of the film tells all or at least the official version of the story.But was that accepted version the real story? For the first time the Ford brothers, Robert and Charley, get their due. As played by Casey Affleck, Robert Ford was a most complex character indeed. Ford is shown for what he was, a moonstruck kid who was brought up on those dime novels and idolized the legendary bandit. The fact that Charley was already riding with the James gang got him into the group.After the last job the James gang pulled and the only Ford was ever in on, the Fords kind of attached themselves to Jesse James. Of course the idol is no hero. Brad Pitt plays a most unheroic Jesse.Hints of Pitt's interpretation of Jesse's character are found in the classic portrayal of Jesse James by Tyrone Power. Remember when the laconic Henry Fonda as Frank James dresses Jesse down, tells him he's getting mean, meaner every day even with some of his own gang members? Power was showing signs of it, but we see Pitt as Jesse do some really brutal and cruel things. At the same time he's a loving husband to Mary Louise Parker and doting father to his two children.As good as Pitt is I think the acting honors go to Casey Affleck. His gradual disillusion with his idol is really something to see on the screen. He becomes really scared of Pitt for reasons I won't reveal, but were definitely sufficient to want him to get Pitt. We also get to see the Fords sorry aftermath. Things did not go so well for them. Bob Ford did not quite get the acclaim he would have liked as Jesse James became bigger after death than in life.Frank James as played briefly in the beginning is an odd peripheral character in this film. The James brothers did separate some months before Jesse's death. Frank is played by Sam Shepard who has an encounter with young Bob Ford at the beginning of the film and announces to one and all, the kid creeps him out. But Jesse likes having the kid follow him around like a puppy dog to his ultimate regret.The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is a very good western and we sure don't see too many of them in these times. It's shot in an unusual color, almost like one of those sepia-tone films that were in vogue for a brief spell. The location shooting was done in western Canada and looks a whole lot more like Missouri then than Missouri does now.",9,152,203,7 November 2007
Tigerland," It Was Always Muddy
","It is certainly interesting to write a review about a film that took place where I actually resided for two months. In September of 1971 when this film is set, your's truly was doing his basic training at Fort Polk, Louisiana. I did get to the North Fort at one point in my training where the infamous Tigerland was located. In fact Tigerland was a nickname given to the whole northern part of the army base.I was doing the basic training to be a weekend warrior and avoid Vietnam. But I saw so many of the kids who were just like the ones portrayed in the film it was actually a rather nerve wrecking old home week. In 1971 everyone except the policy makers in Washington knew that this was going to end when as Senator George Aiken declared, we said we won and then went home. And of course the South Vietnamese government we were protecting would fold like a napkin.By that time the army was scraping the bottom for soldier material and you can see it in the company of men that are in Tigerland. This is where more soldiers shipped for Vietnam than any other place in the nation. The Louisiana swamps best approximated the climate conditions of Vietnam.This particular company has a real odd ball in it with Colin Farrell. He's doing his best to get out of the army, but the army just won't oblige him. So he's waging his own war against them by becoming a 'barracks lawyer' and getting others out. And he's driving the officers and NCOs quite nuts doing it.I would rate Tigerland a lot higher because there is much I liked about the film. It was not shot at Fort Polk, but in places that gave you feel of the place. What I remember best about it was rain and mud. In that summer of 1971 it rained nearly every single day I was there. But the rain and sometimes it would come a few times a day. Would be a sudden downpour, maybe at most 20 minutes then it would cool off and then resume being muggy. And the ground couldn't absorb it fast enough so it was always muddy. You did your best work in that brief period after rain stopped it was then actually decent enough for normal activities.What I couldn't quite grasp was Colin Farrell's motivations for what he was doing. I blame that on the writer and also the director.As for the other players the best in the cast was Thomas Guiry playing this poor sad sack kid from the Louisiana bayous. I met a few just like him, he stopped his formal education at the 6th grade. It was a touching performance on Guiry's part.So here's to Fort Polk, not a place I recommend, but sometimes a place which is needed to train our soldiers. It got a good film, but not a great one in its honor.",6,5,8,28 May 2010
Days of Thunder," The Need For More Speed
","If I had to guess the genesis for Days of Thunder had its place in two areas. First the fact that Top Gun proved to be such a mega-hit for Tom Cruise that a similar film was almost dictated to be made by Paramount. But secondly it was reported that on the set of The Color of Money, co-star Paul Newman got Cruise interested in auto racing so you put those two things together, Days of Thunder was almost a film that had to be made.The film certainly has the feel of NASCAR to it and it takes its place along side such racing classics as Grand Prix, The Racers and Paul Newman's own film, Winning. The story is the teaming of young rookie sensation Cruise and top mechanic Robert Duvall. Tom's character is a whole lot like the young fighter pilot in Top Gun, a kid with a world of confidence and the ability to make his brag become fact. He's a driver by instinct not knowing a whole lot about the mechanics of a racing car. That's the way he and Duvall complement each other although it's not an easy relationship.Days of Thunder is also the film on which Tom met Mrs. Cruise number two, Nicole Kidman. She's a neurologist who gets to treat Tom after a crash and also drops the hammer on Cruise's rival Michael Rooker and his career after a serious head injury. There are also some nice performances by Randy Quaid as the stock car owner and Cary Elwes as another of Cruise's rival drivers. Fred Dalton Thompson, District Attorney of New York County on Law and Order, former United States Senator, and would be President of the United States is in the cast as the head of NASCAR. If the political thing doesn't work out for Fred, he certainly has the presence and authority to be a baseball commissioner. They'll certainly need another Judge Landis in that job to restore some integrity to that sport.Days of Thunder got an Academy Award nomination for Sound Recording and it's a good followup film for Top Gun.",8,17,25,6 January 2008
Remember the Titans," Titans Rule
","Although Remember The Titans is based on a true story from Northern Virginia in 1971, I couldn't help feeling that I had seen this story before. Then I remembered that a short time before the incidents on which this film is based occurred, there was a film made called Tic Tic Tic. This also involved a southern town growing out of the old days and into the new ones with the post Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act. In that film a new black sheriff played by Jim Brown is elected in a southern town and he asks the former sheriff George Kennedy to stay on as his deputy to help ease the tensions.When the folks who were making Tic Tic Tic happen on the big screen, how could they have known that life was imitating their art. This northern Virginia town was being integrated, black people were now voting, the schools and businesses were being integrated, the city fathers had to take into account a whole new population with the franchise. Successful football coach Will Patton is asked to step aside for Denzel Washington, newly arrived from North Carolina. Patton agrees to stay on as his defensive assistant coach to help the team and not incidentally the town. Because of the good will and good intentions of two strong personalities they make the newly integrated team the Titans work.Even with two Academy Awards and several nominations besides, I doubt Denzel Washington will ever get a more beloved role than Herman Boone. In addition to coach, Washington is husband to Nicole Ari Parker and father to Krysten Leigh Jones. Later on when Patton's daughter Hayden Panettiere comes over to the Washington household to visit, she spends more time with Washington going over the game than with her peer dressing the dolls that little girls are supposed to play with. My favorite scene in the film is with Washington and Panettiere who loves the idea of a child even a girl taking an interest in what puts food on the table, but not quite understanding it. The kids make it work as well. Ryan Hurst who was the team captain under Patton and Donald Faison one of the new black players forge their own bond and make it happen for the rest. Those who won't go with the new program have to learn or leave. My two favorites are the two outsiders who also help make it work. Kip Pardue plays a California hippie type kid who also likes football, if you can fathom that combination and Ethan Suplee who just moved into town and just wants to play football. Neither of them are hung up on all the racial stuff the town was going through, they're presence on the Titans is invaluable.You won't have any problems in remembering the Titans. This is a fine inspirational film showing that people of good will can put hate aside if the better parts of their person is appealed to.",9,3,5,13 December 2009
The Fault in Our Stars," So little time
","If you think that The Fault In Our Stars is just another teen romance are you in
for a pleasant surprise. You'd better have a good supply of tissues because this
film involves two very special teens. Ansel Elgort and Shailene Woodley are a
pair of cancer survivors and they just haven't got very much time.With Woodley she's come through cancer of the thyroid and she has the breathing
apparatus as just part of her person now. Her parents naturally worry about 
over straining herself, but Woodley is determined to lead as active a life as she
can.At a cancer survivor support group she meets Ansel Elgort who has really made
quite a name for himself since this film came out. Elgort is a former basketball star who lost a leg to cancer. He is so incredibly quirky and charming in this
part I'm surprised he didn't get Oscar consideration.The two make a trip to Amsterdam to visit an author they admire. Willem Dafoe however has less than meets the eye, still they have a good time. When
they visit the Anne Frank house the symbolism is certainly not lost on the
viewer.The title is a play on Cassius's famous quote from Julius Caesar about the fault
not lying in our stars but in ourselves. There's no fault here for Woodley an
Elgort. Fate has dealt them a cruel and rotten hand and they have to make the most of it.I haven't seen a film move me as much since Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby. Even a Medusa would be reduced to tears with this one.",8,0,2,19 February 2018
Twilight," Heavenly Shades Of Night Is Falling, It's Twilight Time
","When young Robert Pattinson enters the life of Kirsten Stewart he was sure like any other young man she was likely to meet in her small town in the Pacific Northwest. He was unlike anyone she was likely to meet just about anywhere.Pattinson plays Edward Cullen of the Cullen clan of vampires. And Stewart's character of Belle Swan and Edward Cullen have become cult heroes for this younger generation. Needless to say both older Swans and Cullens aren't crazy about these two kids going out. Still as another popular film of a decade ago remarked, somehow these two complete each other.This film like the Harry Potter series has inspired a bunch of sequels made and in the planning stage from the novels which are bestsellers among current teens. Pattinson and Stewart are an attractive pair of young people and vampire or not, I sure see what they see in each other. More importantly they do communicate love to each other and to the audience.The Twilight series is going to be quite a money maker for a long time to come.",7,1,5,1 January 2010
Meet the Fockers," Those In-Laws
","In Meet The Parents Ben Stiller had to win the trust of Robert DeNiro and Blythe Danner the parents of his girl friend Teri Polo, that famed 'circle of trust' in the Byrnes family. Now the whole family is going to Florida where Stiller's parents the Fockers have a palatial estate and ideas that definitely run counter to those espoused by DeNiro.That opposition is the basis of the wonderful comedy in this sequel to Meet The Parents. With the casting of Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand as Stiller's parents, Meet The Fockers is as funny, maybe funnier than the original film.A whole lot of Focker family secrets are exposed in this comedy and with three of the biggest movie names in the past 40 years in the cast there was definitely built in box office. DeNiro, Hoffman, and Streisand show some incredible comic timing in this film.There's nothing these two families agree on. Even down to the fact that Hoffman's a dog person and DeNiro a cat person is humorous material. The cat turning on the dog in the DeNiro/Danner trailer is a memorable scene.Another favorite of mine are the touch football sequence. I doubt Kennedy family touch football was ever like this. There's also a memorable encounter with a Barney Fife like deputy where DeNiro, Hoffman, and Stiller all go to the pokey. Oddly enough Danner and Streisand hit it off well. Streisand is a sex therapist and makes good money doing it as we see by the way the Fockers live. In fact Hoffman though a lawyer became a stay at home dad. That really gets super macho DeNiro's dander up.Fans of any and all of the players here should make Meet The Fockers a must for your viewing list.",8,3,3,16 September 2016
Zulu," With Alamo Like Odds
","Zulu is the filmed account of the Battle of Rorke's Drift during the war against the Zulu nation in the part of South Africa known as Natal. It's not an explanation of policy as to why the British were in Africa, just an account of 139 brave soldiers successfully holding off 4000 to 5000 Zulu warriors, the fiercest fighters in that part of Africa.To put in American terms for the rest of us Yanks, the British army was facing the same kind of odds the Texans did at the Alamo. They also were not certain any kind of relief was coming because the day before, on January 21, 1879 the army had sustained a cataclysmic defeat against those same Zulus at Isandlwana. Out of 850 soldiers about 50 of them survived, in no shape to give aid to anybody. It was the British equivalent of The Little Big Horn which had taken place on the American frontier three years earlier.But on January 22,23 of 1879 the best of that generation in the United Kingdom performed to the max for Queen and country. Stanley Baker and Michael Caine play the two lieutenants, the engineer and the shave-tail from Sandhurst who commanded the troops at Rorke's Drift. Just a brief bit of research on the internet indicated to me that I saw a fairly accurate account of just what went on for those two days. Zulu combines what is sometimes impossible, good history with good entertainment.If it's broadcast it's not to be missed.",9,23,26,16 April 2007
The Favourite," A classic case of overplaying one's hand
","After having seen and become a fan of the very first series on Masterpiece Theater The First Churchills, I was anxious to see the different slant The Favourite
had on what is an enlargement of the last years of that story. As The First
Churchills was based on Winston Churchill's biography of his ancestor The Duke
of Marlborough it was as expected slanted toward Sarah Jennings Churchill.Accounts other than Churchill's cast Sarah as a shrew. As you see in the First
Churchills, Sarah and Anne grew up together as playmates and were the most
intimate of friends since puberty. When they were apart they wrote letters and
gave each other pen names for their letters. Anne was Mrs. Morley and Sarah
was Mrs. Freeman. The Duke of Marlborough was a great military commander, but no doubt his wife's influence with first Princess Anne when
she was in line for succession and when she became Queen in 1702 the Marlboroughs were riding high.The First Churchills had Margaret Tyzack as Anne who over the course of the
series grew from an eager young princess to a rather dowdy queen. Olivia
Colman's portrayal of Anne is of a woman who has nothing really left but the
throne. This woman had several pregnancies from her husband, the longest
surviving of their children who wasn't stillborn lived to be 9. Her husband a
prince from Denmark also died.By the time this all takes place Anne who patiently put up with Sarah Churchill's constant begging of favors and trying to influence policy was ripe
for a new favorite. And in The Favourite Sarah herself introduces her own
downfall into Anne's court with her own cousin Abigail Hill. It was a classic
case of overplaying one's hand.The three actresses who play Anne, Sarah, and Abigail dominate this film.
Olivia Colman won the film's only Oscar for Best Actress playing Queen Anne
and she is dowdy, tired, mercurial and plain tired and world weary all at once.
Quite a few people died before she who never expected to be queen was. By
all accounts she was a nice woman before being overwhelmed with the
responsibility's of the throne. There's also more than a hint of a lesbian relationship with Anne and Sarah. Getting all those emotions out and then
some is the hallmark of a great performance.Rachel Weisz plays Sarah who like Susan Hampshire in The First Churchills just
never knew when to quit. Emma Stone as Abigail knew exactly when to quit.
She made a good marriage to Sam Masham who became a Baron. When Anne
died, Abigail knew it was time to gracefully bow it. She lived quietly in the
countryside and died in 1734. Sarah way outlived both Anne and Abigail
dying 1748. Her saved correspondence provide a lively account of her era
written from Sarah's point of view.The Favourite's only Oscar was for Olivia Colman. Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone both got Supporting Actress nominations and the film also was nominated for Best Picture and a flock of other awards.I really recommend seeing this and then getting a copy of The First Churchills.
Or you might read Winston Churchill's award winning biography of the Duke
to get Sarah's side in that magnificent Churchillian prose.",9,4,6,10 March 2019
1941," 1941, a film that will live gloriously
","I have a sneaking suspicion that Steven Spielberg must have seen and loved It's A Mad Mad Mad Mad World as a sixteen year old kid and resolved that if he became as big a movie name as Stanley Kramer he'd do a film just like it. In 1979 Spielberg succeeded admirably creating a chaotic classic about a very serious time.I doubt we're ever going to be ready for decades for a film like this about the days following the Twin Towers. Those were pretty scary days, especially on the Pacific coast where our fleet with the remarkable exception of the carriers was at the bottom of Pearl Harbor and who really knew where and how many the Japanese were following the attack in Hawaii. It should give you cold chills to think that if it was more than Toshiro Mifune lost submarine with German observer Christopher Lee on it that they would have been met with what we see in 1941. At the time our home defense on the Pacific Coast was commanded by Major General Joseph L. Stillwell known to all as Vinegar Joe. But he could be moved as we see as he takes in a screening of Dumbo which did come out around that time. Like It's A Mad Mad Mad Mad World the cast it populated with some of the great comedians and comic players of the time. At some point or other they all intersect in their comic defense of California under attack from the Japanese as surely as the world was under attack from Orson Welles's broadcast of War Of The Worlds.There are a lot of memorable performances where some serious players got to show a comic side and really get unrestrained. One example would be crazy National Guard colonel Warren Oates meeting up with equally crazy would be air ace John Belushi. Slim Pickens saves California by his Faux constipation, he really goes unrestrained. Tim Matheson as Stilwell's aide is as horny as he was in Animal House as he maps out a campaign to nail aviation buff Nancy Allen and winds up midair in a plane he knows not how to fly.Robert Stack plays Vinegar Joe Stilwell the only true character in 1941 and he plays it straight as a string. If he survived this bunch of lunatics, how come he couldn't get Chiang Kai-Shek off his duff and fight those Japanese who were really invading his country? Maybe duty in the Far East was a welcome relief for Stilwell, but not for long.Be eternally grateful that this was NOT the way it was in 1941 and sit back and enjoy.",8,3,4,26 April 2016
Revolutionary Road," Wheeler Family Values
","The Titanic lovers, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, get reunited for Revolutionary Road a tale of sterile life in the suburbs during the Eisenhower years. Not that this is anything new, the subject was done as comedy and as drama in such diverse films way back then as Rally Round The Flag Boys and Strangers When We Meet.It's a nice story, but not one I could terribly worked up about. So Leonardo is working for some firm as a sales rep and it's a job he hates. Good for him, 90% of the American work force are in jobs that are just paychecks to support themselves and their families. Which Leo and Kate increased by two during the course of the film.Seeing themselves in a rut, Kate lets fly the brilliant suggestion that he just quit and move to Paris. Not only that he should just 'find himself' and she'll work and support and raise the kids and him. Leo likes the idea, but then gets cold feet and it goes downhill from there.Leo and Kate are fine, but the film just is not up to the standards set by Titanic. I sure cared a lot more about Jack and Rose than I did about either of the Wheelers. Nevertheless Revolutionary Road which is the name of the street the Wheelers live on in the film, got three Oscar nominations including one for Michael Shannon as the bipolar son of the Wheeler's neighbor Kathy Bates who sold them the house. Nowadays Shannon would be on his meds and leading a more productive life than he is here. Shannon lost for Best Supporting Actor to Heath Ledger for the Dark Knight.Revolutionary Road is entertaining, but hardly groundbreaking.",7,2,2,2 September 2011
Foxcatcher," One uptight man
","Before watching and writing about Foxcatcher I did a bit of research about John DuPont and it confirmed what I saw in this film. Before any of the action of this film takes place, DuPont already had been accused of making improper advances by one man. He was also ever so briefly married, just like Rock Hudson.Steve Carrell plays the uptight and repressed gay man John DuPont with a minimum of dialog and emotion, but with facial and body language that tell more than 20 pages of script could. He well deserved to be nominated for Best Actor.John DuPont is from one of America's richest families and he's a man with a lot of money and a lot of time on his hands. He's developed an interest in wrestling and not the kind that Vince McMahon gives us three night a week. He decides to develop and finance a team of wrestlers that will win all championships including Olympic gold. Carrell is like George Steinbrenner with an open checkbook in the free agency market.Two of his wants are the brothers Schultz. Mark is played by Channing Tatum and he is dazzled by the world that Carrell wants to invite him into. Carrell is crushing out on Channing Tatum big time which is understandable. David the older and more successful brother is played by Mark Ruffalo who got a Best Supporting Actor nomination is harder to get, but he does succumb. It leads to one unspeakable tragedy.Foxcatcher also got nominations for Best Director, Best Makeup, and Best Original Screenplay. It didn't come away with any statues though.I should also mention Vanessa Redgrave as Carrell's grand dame of society mother who is as uptight as her son. She too with minimal dialog conveys this branch of the large DuPont family is one uptight limb of the family tree.Foxcatcher is a deeply disturbing, but very good film to see.",9,3,4,7 March 2015
Lawrence of Arabia," A Complex Man In Epic Events
","Although having just watched Lawrence Of Arabia again though I am bowled over by the size of the epic, I still can't believe that for the entire length of the film, the word oil was not mentioned. If it were done today it sure would be.T.E. Lawrence's story fascinates people today more than ever because he was in the center of the events that gave us the Middle East we have today. In the previous century and a half questions about that area revolved around the Ottoman Empire, the so-called sick man of Europe for that conglomerate of territory spilled into quite a bit of Europe. What's to happen if one country gets control of the place should that aging and decrepit empire falls apart. The question was postponed right up to World War I when Ottoman Turkey committed itself to the Central Powers. It was time then for the various peoples still under Ottoman control to rise and rise they did. In Arabia a young staff officer named T.E. Lawrence gained the trust and confidence of many Arab leaders and had a lot to do with uniting them and forming an army to chase fellow Moslems, the Turks out of the area and helping the British and French win in the Eastern theater of World War I. If going native which was the expression used by the British for one of their's who starts to identify with those he's supposed to subjugate than T.E. Lawrence went native in a big way. When his fellow countrymen did not keep pledges made to his Arabs he opted for a life of obscurity which is what he got until his death in 1935.David Lean when he couldn't get Marlon Brando for the part, opted instead for a young Irish player named Peter O'Toole who he had seen in the Walt Disney version of Kidnapped two years earlier in a small role. It was a felicitous choice as O'Toole became the star he remains to this day as a result of Lawrence of Arabia.It's a complex role and one you have to keep the audience interested in for over four hours. O'Toole runs the whole range of emotions here. We see him as idealistic, as arrogant, as humble, as honorable, as a stone killer, even a bit of a fathead at times. Sometimes a few of these mixed together at different points. Although David Lean got him a stellar supporting cast, if your Lawrence isn't any good, the film would flop. But Peter O'Toole was up to the challenge, he got the first of seven Oscar nominations. In this particular year he had some stiff competition with Burt Lancaster for Birdman of Alcatraz, Jack Lemmon for The Days of Wine and Roses, Marcello Mastroianni for Divorce Italian Style and the eventual winner Gregory Peck for To Kill a Mockingbird.Omar Sharif also making his first film for a world market got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Such Lean veterans as Alec Guinness, Jack Hawkins, and Anthony Quayle got plum roles. Anthony Quinn and Arthur Kennedy are the Americans in this film. Kennedy plays the fictitious Jackson Bentley who is really Lowell Thomas. Presumably Lowell Thomas did not want his name used here, but Thomas got his career started in the news field by reporting on T.E. Lawrence in this backwater theater of World War I, making his name famous and launching Thomas's own career in the process.One thing ever so gingerly hinted at was T.E. Lawrence's homosexuality. You can see it in his relationship with the two young men Daoud and Farraj played by John Dimech and Michel Roy. There is the alleged incident of gang rape when he's taken by Turkish soldiers led by their commander at Deraa, Jose Ferrer. It too is part of Lawrence's story though if Lawrence of Arabia were made today, they would be far more explicit.They would also be more explicit about oil instead of these unnamed 'British interests' that Lawrence is supposed to be really concerned with. You do get the idea that all they're interested in is the right of transit in the Suez Canal and the right to say who has the right of transit.Still Lawrence of Arabia is one sweeping epic both capturing the grandeur of the Arabian desert with the complexity of the issues and the man surrounding the desert campaign in World War I.",9,5,10,19 February 2007
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Dinosaur breeding ground
","In The Lord World: Jurassic Park we learn that after the disaster of the Jurassic Park dinosaur theme park developed by Richard Attenborough, there's been a palace coup in his conglomerate. Pete Postelthwaite his greedy nephew has taken over and they want to exploit another island which was used as a breeding ground. So Attenborough assembles a team to stop them including Jeff Goldblum from the original film and Dian Fossey like naturalist Julianne Moore.It's a well equipped military expedition that Postelthwaite mounts to go to that second island. But if you think that makes a difference to the dinosaurs, it's another think coming you have. For both heroes and villains there is enough heart stopping action for 3 Indiana Jones films.Jeff Goldblum has polished up his wry, ironic character to such a degree one can see the beginnings of Detective Zack Nichols from Criminal Intent in this film. Vince Vaughn has a nice turn as a Greenpeace activist on the Attenborough team.Directed once again by Steven Spielberg The Lost World: Jurassic Park is not as good as the original, but miles better than the third dinosaur incarnation in this series. The last part of the film takes place in San Diego where a live specimen of T-Rex has been brought back for exhibit. All I can say is that someone watched both King Kong and Gorgo for the result is a combination of both those films.Two pretty good ones I'd say.",6,3,21,27 July 2016
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," The Ape Revolution has begun
","Apparently it's been decided that a new generation needs a remake of the great ape series from the Sixties/Seventies and we are in Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes. This is where the Ape called Caesar leads the other apes in a revolt against humans. Eventually the apes will decide that they're better equipped to run planet Earth and who's to say they're not.Scientist James Franco in an experiment to cure Alzheimer's Disease has perfected a genetically enhanced ape which is named Caesar. Back in the first series of Ape films, Caesar and his father were played by the erudite Roddy McDowall in heavy simian makeup. The serum that Franco has concocted seems to be working on his father John Lithgow and Caesar is happy with Franco, Lithgow and girlfriend of Franco, Frieda Pinto.But an incident where Caesar is protecting Lithgow after an altercation with a neighbor leads to the ape being taken. That sets off a series of events and when the film is over the Ape Revolution has begun. The cast is nice, but the star is the computer graphic generated special effects. No longer a few hundred extras in ape suits are needed, with just a few extras the battle on the Golden Gate Bridge is nicely staged.And for those who remember the original series, the seeds for the next ape production are showed right here at the end of this film.No Monkey business about this film, I think even the ape fans of a preceding generation will like this.",6,4,11,6 October 2011
JFK," The Real Story?
","The questions that everyone raises about Oliver Stone's JFK is whether the choice to make the controversial District Attorney Jim Garrison the protagonist/hero of the piece. A cursory glance at even the Wikipedia article about Garrison shows a career full of controversy, his investigation of the Kennedy assassination only the most known.Kevin Costner plays Garrison who is presented as Mr. Average Man of the new South going through at this time the catharsis of the social change the Civil Rights Era wrought. A couple names known to him surface in reports about the assassination and Garrison starts his own probe. It brings him the most controversy in a controversial career and nearly wrecks his domestic situation as wife Sissy Spacek threatens to leave and take the kids.The most flamboyant performance in the film is that of Joe Pesci as David Faerie who was the linchpin of Garrison's case. He was the link to the late Lee Harvey Oswald and the collection of folks that Garrison eventually indicted. Remember all the action in the film ended in 1969 a few months before the Stonewall Rebellion. We're introduced in this case to a bunch of gay conservatives, in fact they're downright reactionary. Faerie is a pilot and part of the underground gay culture that New Orleans had. Today it's a lot more open I assure you. Today this bunch would be Log Cabin Republicans.The group is headed by Tommy Lee Jones playing Clay Shaw who since just about everyone in the Sixties was in the closet, Jones ruled the gay closet in New Orleans at the time. Unlike Faerie or Kevin Bacon who plays a favorite boy toy of the clique and who get busted in bar raids regularly, Jones is rich enough to be above all that. I'm surprised he didn't retain Roy Cohn as an attorney although he probably figured a New York Jew wouldn't go over big in a New Orleans court.At the time Oliver Stone got pilloried for delving on the gay aspect of the conspirators. That was an error, these guys were what they were. Whether Garrison was really on to something is a whole other matter which we may never know until everything about the Kennedy assassination is declassified.Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are in this and it is on the list of their collaborative work although they have no scenes together. Matthau has a scene on an airplane with Costner and Matthau plays Senator Russell B. Long of Louisiana, son of a man who was assassinated himself. He's most skeptical about the Warren Report. Lemmon plays a gumshoe operative working for Edward Asner playing Guy Bannister who was linked to Shaw. He was a nasty, brutal, reactionary drunk and gets into it with Lemmon on the day of the assassination in flashback. Lemmon gives Costner some leads in the right direction. JFK is a film that provides a view of the Kennedy assassination, but good as it is should be taken with a grain of salt.",7,1,7,23 October 2012
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," That's how it was
","Quentin Tarantino has given us a masterpiece with an historic teaming of Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt. The two really work well together and that's
half the secret of this film.The other half is incredible detail to the period of this movie which takes place in
1969 Hollywood. DiCaprio plays a former western star who would like to get his
career jump started again. I remember back in the 50s and early 60s television
was saturated with westerns. DiCaprio is playing one of those stars and westerns had gone into a decline as public taste has changed. But there are a
few being made still and DiCaprio is shooting an episode in Lancer.Back in the day Brad Pitt was his stunt double and now he's gotten older and
heavier and he's a iconoclastic sort.and he's essentially DiCaprio's entourage.
These two are so great together in every scene they're both in.As it turns out DiCaprio lives in a Beverly Hills cul-de-sac and his neighbors are
Roman Polanski and his wife the ill fated Sharon Tate played her by Margot Robbie. There's this aura of tragedy that Tarantino creates around her and her
friend hairstylist to the star Jay Sebring played by Emile Hirsch. For one who
in her short career played some sexpots there's a sweet innocence in Robbie's
portrayal of Tate.Also note good performances by Al Pacino as a producer always on the cutting
edge of new trends in the business. And Bruce Dern is unforgettable as George Spahn who owned the movie ranch property where many westerns were shot back in the day. Dern has a memorable scene with Pitt.There might definitely be some Oscars in this one. See it by all means.",9,38,62,27 July 2019
Behind The Candelabra," The Years With Lee
","With same sex marriage now becoming a reality in many areas it's a good thing to examine some of the relationships that were and still are considered the norm in the gay world. Such a relationship involved Liberace and Scott Thorson played with extraordinary verisimilitude by Michael Douglas and Matt Damon in Behind The Candelabra. This film directed by Steven Soderbergh should have received a big screen release.There's a whole generation of people who have grown up and another one growing who have no knowledge of Liberace the entertainer. Now with so many show business celebrities never even entering the closet let alone emerging it almost seems quaint how Liberace took such pains to hide who and what he was as if such a flamboyant personality ever could.With the kind of wealth he amassed Liberace could get just about anyone he wanted and on his own terms. So when young Scott Thorson came back stage one fine afternoon and Liberace took one look at him it was lust at first sight. His current flame went and Scott was ensconced in the palatial estate in Las Vegas which he lived in luxury as a kept boy toy.These relationships are always dangerous. Scott may have the attractiveness, but Liberace had the money and the power. Years ago when I worked at New York State Crime Victims Board I had a case where a man in his 60s was killed and left a surviving partner in his 40s and they had been together for about 20 years. It was a relationship like Liberace and Thorson had. The older man was a business executive and the younger did nothing but keep house. Because there was no same sex marriage when the older man died, the younger inherited nothing that was not in his name. But worse than that he had no job or trade he could fall back on, he was completely dependent on the older for support. Scott Thorson wanted to be a veterinarian when he met Liberace. I'm sure he's sorry he didn't learn some kind of job to fall back on. The palimony suit that he brought against Liberace was out of sheer necessity.Douglas and Damon bring both men alive for a younger generation, more importantly a younger generation of LGBT young people who can see what it was like in the bad old days which aren't quite over. The two truly dominate the film, but Debbie Reynolds as Liberace venerated mother and Dan Aykroyd as business manager Seymour Heller and most of all Rob Lowe as a quack doctor who hooks Damon on diet pills are quite memorable. Matt Damon who is getting on should have done this project in the 90s. But his skill pulls off the part where he's clearly too old.I recommend this film highly for young gay audiences.",9,0,2,18 September 2013
Django Unchained," From slave to bounty hunter
","With a film that's part a throwback to the black exploitation films of the Seventies and part a homage to the ballet violence of Sam Peckinpah, Quentin Tarantino has given us Django Unchained about a newly freed slave turned bounty hunter under the tutelage of Christoph Walz.When this film opens poor Jamie Fox as the title character is part of a group of slaves chained up and heading for the auction block. But it turns out to be his lucky day as traveling dentist Christoph Walz wants to make a private deal because Fox can identify three brothers who are wanted. Walz is a bounty hunter with abolitionist tendencies and he makes short work of the slavers and has a paper making Fox his legal whom he immediately frees.Fox agrees to become Walz's partner, but he's got some conditions of his own like finding and freeing his wife who was deliberately sold separately from him. They do a good season's work and then go on the mission for Kerry Washington, Fox's wife. She's on a Mississippi plantation owned by Leonardo DiCaprio.If DiCaprio's character were around today he'd be a charter member of the White Citizen's Council. He takes white supremacy as a simple matter of fact. DiCaprio got deserved raves for his performance. But the most intriguing role in the film for me was that of Samuel L. Jackson who plays the head of the household servants. Seeing Jackson in his part took me back to early Nineties when I saw a production of Anton Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard with the character of Piers who was a servant and who totally identified with his employers. And the aristocrats who employed him just think of him as part of the furniture. There's a lot of Piers in Jackson's character with a nasty racial component that smacks of Uncle Tom.Quentin Tarantino saw a lot of those films that starred people like Richard Roundtree, James Brown, and Fred Williamson back when I was a lot younger in creating Django. He also took careful note of how Sam Peckinpah staged his violent scenes in such things as The Getaway and The Wild Bunch.Still it's the players that make this one work, DiCaprio and Samuel L. Jackson most of all.",7,3,7,4 February 2013
2012," Will Nostradamus and the Mayans be proved right?
","The film 2012 starts with the premise that out in the movie-going public there are a considerable number of people who are aware of the prophecies of Nostradamus and the fact that the Mayan calendar ended in our year 2012. Otherwise the title and film would have really little significance.In point of fact there have been several times in history when a lot of folks thought that certain years would mark the end. In the 19th century a gentleman named William Miller managed to convince quite a following that 1844 was going to be the end of the world. When it didn't happen, he lost a bit of credibility.2012 is a combination end times film you see normally out of Christian productions and the end product of those Seventies era disaster movies. Solar flare activity has been on the rise and those flames of burning hydrogen are heating the Earth from the outside and from the inside like a microwave oven.However this has been foreseen and a disaster plan is put into operation by President Danny Glover and other heads of state. But his top science adviser Oliver Platt takes operational control and he's a nasty dude with his own ideas of maybe ruling a post apocalyptic world. He quarrels with another scientist Chiwetal Ejifor and the two have a running Spock/McCoy battle for pure science over humanity throughout the film. At the same time hack novelist John Cusack learns of the impending cataclysm and works quite a few miracles to get his family out and be listed among the survivors. In fact he plays a key role in everybody's survival in the film.One memorable character you won't forget is Woody Harrelson who runs a doomsday pirate radio station. As all his conspiracy theories are proved right, his dying reaction is positively orgasmic.Barack Obama could not have been better portrayed on the screen even in pseudonym than by Danny Glover. He gives his blessings to scientist daughter Thandie Newton and to Ejifor for their hoped for survival. Newton and Glover's scenes are the most human and humane in 2012.Is there validity to all of this? Those earthquakes in Christchurch, New Zealand and Fugoshima, Japan certainly give one pause to reflect. On the other times a whole lot of my credit cards have been renewed past 2012, one of them up to 2015. Can Visa, Mastercard, and American Express know something we don't.2012 set out to be the ultimate disaster film and it came considerably short of the mark. But it's not bad entertainment and does pose a few questions for the audience to ponder on.",6,0,1,6 April 2011
Hellboy," The Hellboy Cottage Industry
","If Mike Mignola isn't careful he's going to have a whole cottage industry devoted to his comic strip creation Hellboy. Having just come from Hellboy II: The Golden Army and seeing his credits at this website makes me think about what a gold mine Mignola has found.I saw the original Hellboy and I was struck by the fact at the time I could enjoy this film as an action/adventure and the tongue in cheek humor that is prevalent throughout. A lot of that is due to the fact that Mignola was apparently given a free hand to bring his comic book creation to life on the big screen. A lot is also due to Ron Perlman and the marvelous character he creates beneath all that demon makeup.Hellboy is brought to life by the son of Rasputin the Mad Monk in the final days of World War II. Rasputin being the good royalist he is, finds work with the Nazis who are now down to using black magic to pull out a victory. Adolph Hitler was known in fact to delve into the occult. Anyway their experiments produce an infant demon plucked from the spirit world, but he's rescued by John Hurt who raises him like a son and he grows up to be butt-kicking demon Ron Perlman who's grown to like such earthly pleasures as beer and cigars. Hurt functions as the Obi Won Kenobe of this piece and when he's killed, there ain't no stopping Perlman.Hellboy is rollicking good fun, Hellboy II is even better and I'm sure we've got a Hellboy, III in our future.",8,7,8,17 July 2008
Good Will Hunting," The Genius In Our Midst
","So many personal projects of our best players never come out quite right. The vision they have somehow doesn't translate to the screen, or it's not box office subject matter, or maybe the actors aren't gifted with writing or directing talent. That's certainly not the case with Good Will Hunting which was not only the breakthrough film for Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, but it will probably remain their most personal endeavor. Not too much imagination was required though because these guys set this film in their native Boston the city they grew up in, the city they seem to know every nook and cranny of. They didn't even have to lose the New England accents they would have to in most of their other films.When Matt and Ben wrote Good Will Hunting the fact they were able to interest a top director like Gus Van Sant in the project should have said something before one views a frame of film. Van Sant got an Oscar nominated performance for Matt Damon and a Supporting Actor Oscar for Robin Williams as the psychologist who counsels Damon.Will Hunting is this average lower middle class kid from South Boston who was in the foster care system and suffered a lot of abuse while growing up. He has some low level jobs, he's constantly getting in trouble with the law for minor scrapes, and he's a functioning genius who for kicks solves a highly complex mathematical equation between buffing floors at MIT.Which perks the interest of Stellan Skarsgaard highly touted mathematics professor there. He feels and I agree with him that one of the worst sins in the world is wasting the talent the Deity blesses you with, whatever it is. After a succession of therapists who are unable to cope with Damon's genius, Robin Williams gets his turn at bat.Robin Williams one of the wildest, wackiest, most innovative comics that ever walked the earth, drops all of that to deliver a highly sensitive performance as the psychologist who finally reaches Damon on some level. What Damon does with it is for you to see Good Will Hunting for.Some of that breakthrough is achieved with the help of Minnie Driver, a British student at Harvard who falls hard for the blue collar Will Hunting. Most of it is achieved though in the film's key scene as Ben Affleck tells him that no matter what your IQ is, if you don't use it and move up and on, you're the stupidest guy here. It's one of Affleck's best scenes in his whole career on film.I've known a few Will Huntings in my day, blessed with talent I would like to have had and who threw it away for a combination of reasons. One in particular I knew back in the Eighties was a kid who originally grew up in Virginia in the Blue Ridge Mountain country to some really uneducated hicks. They discovered he was gay and immediately had him committed. Back in the day, they did all kinds of things to him like electroshock therapy and guess what, it all didn't work. But it left him a twisted and bitter person who gravitated to the new gay rights movement because it was something that finally validated him as a human being.He also was blessed with an incredible baritone singing voice, he could have sang opera had that been trained instead of his parents trying to change his orientation. But when I last saw him in the middle Eighties no one had or could reach him. He made a living running a cleaning service for apartments. If he couldn't sing militant songs of protest he wasn't interested, even if he could have reached millions more with his issues had he studied, learned, and developed.Unlike Will Hunting, Jimmy Flowers wasn't reached as far as I know. But Matt Damon and Ben Affleck in writing their Oscar winning original screenplay could have known him. So I'm sure they won't mind if I dedicated this review to Jimmy whether he's alive or no longer with us. I'm sure there are Jimmy Flowers and Will Huntings that we've all known and hopefully we have the wit to recognize the talent whatever it is and the encouraging nature to make people develop that talent.",10,64,87,3 September 2008
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Those that dream and those that do
","For those who remember the Sam Goldwyn film on The Secret Life Of Walter
Mitty you will find this new version nothing like it. Ben Stiller got some laughs
in for sure, but his general treatment of the classic James Thurber story is far
different than the one that starred Danny Kaye back in the day. Goldwyn and
Kaye opted for straight comedy.Stiller's MItty gets a lot of time to daydream, he's got a job keeping all the
photographs that Life Magazine has had since it's inception. But new management in the form of Adam Scott is shaking things up as Life will now be strictly an on line publication. Still there's one issue to be gotten out and
Stiller has mislaid the negative he was sent from photographer Sean Penn.Penn lives the life going out to exciting and dangerous places to bring back the
news photographs for Life that Stiller only dreams about daily. So in that 
month's time Stiller embarks on a global search for Penn based on some 
very fragmentary evidence of where Penn is. Penn likes the solitary life in a
sense he and Stiller make a complete human being, Penn with the action and
Stiller with the purpose that never gets put into action until now.Some performances of note are Shirley MacLaine as Stiller's mother, Kristen Wiig as the object of Stiller's affections that he hasn't the nerve to speak to
until recently, and Adam Scott who is definitely representative of the Age of
Trump as Stiller's new boss come in for the liquidation of a great institution.Some nice location photography is also part of The Secret Life Of Walter MItty
which in the end isn't so secret any more.",7,2,2,9 April 2018
Schindler's List," When The State Dehumanizes A People
","It would not have been possible to have made Schindler's List immediately after World War II. The public was just taking in the magnitude of the Holocaust, they might not have believed it. Fortunately for the prosecutors at Nuremberg and for history the Nazis being the anal retentives that they were, made these incredibly meticulous records which scholars and historians have sifted through and we have the whole thing incredibly documented by the perpetrator's own hand. With a fifty year perspective now and the very existence of the state of Israel questioned by those who ought to know better, Steven Spielberg has given us a work for the ages.If you can sit through two incredibly long and sorrowful films one ought to see Schindler's List back to back with The Diary Of Anne Frank. In the latter film, we see a very ordinary group of people fighting for survival to escape the fate of what we see happened to so many. The fact they were days from possible liberation makes the sorrow of that film all the more poignant.Schindler's List is a story of escape from the ultimate fate of six million. Oskar Schindler played by Liam Neeson is a German businessman who sees a chance at some nice war profits using some incredibly cheap labor from the concentration camps. He's willing to start a factory in occupied Poland with slave labor Jews. Towards that end he hears of a man who ran a factory among the Jews in the newly formed Cracow ghetto, Itzak Stern played by Ben Kingsley. Kingsley agrees to work for him and with him recruiting the labor force, Neeson gets his factory going. With that comes responsibility for these people. He fights for them, the original ones and some added to his growing work force. Over the over 3 hour film, Neeson gradually changes and his concern for his charges becomes humanitarian. He plays a dangerous game, especially with concentration camp commandant Ralph Fiennes. A man who delights in the total power he's been handed and the liberation from all civilized restraints to exercise barbarism, arbitrary and capricious. Fiennes will chill you with his penultimate portrayal of a perfect Nazi.Let us not forget that Schindler himself was a Nazi. He did in fact in the end go broke in paying out bribes for special consideration for his charges that meant their very lives. It's also possible that he saw the way the war would end and that those responsible for the Holocaust would be held accountable. Some have speculated that he did this for no other reason than to bank credit with possible witnesses. If that was the case it certainly worked because he was investigated and not charged with any war crimes.Still I'd prefer to believe the testimony of those on the scene including the real life Itzak Stern. Those are the folks that ought to know.Schindler's List was nominated for 12 Academy Awards and won seven including Best Picture and Best Director for Steven Spielberg. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes were nominated for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor. It deserved every honor it got and I only wish Neeson and Fiennes were winners as well.It's a film about the Holocaust, but it's also a film about the results of dehumanization of a people and when the state completes the process of dehumanization what can be the result. I'm not sure what future work Steven Spielberg has planned, but he can't top this no way, no how.",10,31,53,16 November 2008
The Mist," Under Her Charismatic Sway
","The Mist settles over a small town in Maine near an Army base and it becomes immediately apparent that this ain't no ordinary overcast. When creatures start emerging from it doing all kinds of things to mankind, a group take shelter in a supermarket. The creatures out there are bad enough, but what's really frightening in this adaption of a Stephen King story is the behavior of some in the market. I've often maintained that players take roles in these horror films because it allows them to overact outrageously, but they will never be criticized for it.Running away with this film is Marcia Gay Harden who when things are normal is dismissed as a crazy church lady. She starts preaching to the trapped people in the market and before long most in there are taking her seriously. The behavior of the people under her charismatic sway is more frightening than some of the special effects creatures out in the mist.Running close to Harden are Frances Sternhagen the no nonsense spinster school teacher and Thomas Jayne, the young father seeming to have leadership of the sane ones thrust upon him. He leads a group out from the market and then at the very end, not having all the facts at his disposal makes a terrible choice. Knowledge is power and fear of the unknown will lead humankind to behave abominably.",8,2,6,5 December 2007
22 Jump Street," You'd better be ready to jump again
","As in the original 21 Jump Street, the social conscience and relevant topics aspect of the television series are left out again. Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill after really messing up a big drug bust are back at the Jump Street program which has now moved across the street to 22 Jump Street. Their captain Ice Cube has decided the best thing for them is a trip back to college where there is a major drug problem with some new designer product.The bonds however look like they're going to fray as they gravitate to different crowds. Tatum looks like he's going to join the Animal House crowd as he gravitates to a fraternity where the stuff is known to be used. He bonds with a pair that look they could be John Belushi's brethren with Wyatt Russell and Jimmy Tatro.Who'd have thunk it with Channing Tatum in the film that Jonah Hill would get the girl. Hill gets himself involved with a literary crowd, some poetry slammers and Amber Hill. Of all the young women in the world how did he wind up nailing his captain's daughter?The comedy is straight out of Animal House and there's certain enough action to satisfy those of the movie-going public who prefer that. Will there be a 24 Jump Street? Possibly, but I'm not going to put the rent money on it.",5,0,2,9 February 2015
Dog Day Afternoon," Underlying Motive
","The late John Wojtowicz whose mad exploit on one afternoon in Brooklyn probably never dreamed his life would result in an awarded picture. But I suppose the Oscar that Frank Pierson won for Best Original Screenplay kind of verified his time on earth. Not to mention the five other Oscar categories Dog Day Afternoon was nominated in, Best Picture, Best Film Editing, Best Director for Sidney Lumet, Best Actor for Al Pacino and Best Supporting Actor for Chris Sarandon.It all happened to be sure on Avenue P in Brooklyn, the location that the film was shot on 10th Street was not where it happened, just the same borough. But the film sure comes close to graphically illustrating the bizarre carnival of events that happened in the summer of 1972.Al Pacino playing Sonny Wojcik is a gay man who has left his wife and kids and is now living with a man who has confessed to him he's a transgender individual and the doctors have recommended a sex change for him. The sexually confused Pacino and at that time he was hits on this mad move to rob a bank to get enough money for sexual reassignment. At that time the cost they're talking about is $2500.00 which now wouldn't pay for the scrub nurse. Then as now medical insurance companies won't cover it.So Pacino goes in with buddies John Cazale and Gary Springer and pulls a robbery at closing time at a Brooklyn bank. They're supposed to be in and out, but these guys aren't professional criminals. One thing leads to another and law enforcement has Pacino and Cazale trapped, Springer having opted out of the crime real early.Then the media freak show begins, at first with crowd actually on Pacino's side as he gives lip to the law. Then when they find out what is the underlying motive for the robbery, good old homophobia takes over. The cheers turn to jeers when Pacino comes out in the street for the police and the cameras.Dog Day Afternoon is a key film for the gay/lesbian/bisexual/transgender community in the USA. It's one of the first that explores a gamut of issues like the closet, internalized homophobia, being forced into marriage for convention's sake, even same gender marriage. It's exploitive to be sure, but does have its tender moments as well. The highlight of the film for me is the phone conversation with Pacino and Sarandon who had no idea what Pacino had in mind. Sarandon gave one of the first performances of a transgender person in a major motion picture.John Wojtowicz, Sonny Wojcik for the film did a stretch in the federal pen for the bank robbery and after he was released I met him. By the time we met, both of us were comfortable in our sexuality, I was most closeted when this incident happened. When we met it was the late Eighties. If I was comfortable, John Wojtowicz was positively reveling in it.Dog as he was then known because of the film was a character in the Greenwich Village bar scene where I met him. Dog used his celebrity, notoriety if you prefer, to get himself a fabulous share of rent boys whom he paid nominal monies for services. He carried ever ready copy of faded clippings from the crime and some of those dumb kids actually thought of him as something special. As a character Dog certainly was.When I moved out of New York I didn't see Dog around any more and he died a few years ago. The man had his fifteen minutes of celebrity and worked it to the max. This review is dedicated to John Wojtowicz as one unforgettable individual.",8,0,1,19 January 2012
Amadeus," The Mercurial Genius
","Long after his rival died at a young age and his world essentially obliterated by the Napoleonic wars, Antonio Salieri as played by F. Murray Abraham looks back on his life from the confines of an insane asylum. Everywhere the music of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is played and hummed familiarly by even the masses. Scholars study Salieri, the people from all walks of life listen to the notes that Amadeus put down for posterity.Amadeus is a wonderful recreation of the court at Schonbrunn Palace in Vienna during the age of reason. The Hapsburgs have now become the House of Hapsburg-Lorraine as a result of Maria Theresa becoming the first female monarch of their empire. The empire and the court are now ruled by her son Joseph as played by Jeffrey Jones. What I liked about the film is that author Peter Shaffer obviously researched with great care the period this rivalry between Salieri and Mozart takes place. Jones remarks on more than one occasion about letters he got from his sister Antoinette from the French court and what she's observing, but not quite understanding.Mozart is played by young Tom Hulce and in one of the few times that two actors from the same film got nominated in the same acting category, Hulce and Abraham were both up for Best Actor and Abraham won as opposed to both of them canceling each other out. It really would be hard to live on the difference in their performances, without a good Mozart and an equally good Salieri, the film would not be the masterpiece it is.And it did win for Best Picture, Best Director for Milos Forman and a flock of other Oscars, all well deserved. Besides those already mentioned I think you will enjoy Elizabeth Berridge as Mozart's long suffering wife and Roy Dotrice as his more staid and settled father who can't cope with a mercurial genius of a son any better than Abraham can.And Amadeus brought a revival of interest in the old classical masters and that's always a good thing.",9,3,6,5 October 2007
The Man Who Would Be King," Those Minstrel Boys
","Using the old Irish folk tune, the Minstrel Boy for background, John Huston made himself one old fashioned movie of adventure and romance like we rarely see today.Of course this film rises and falls on the charm and chemistry of its two leads, Sean Connery and Michael Caine. They're a pair of lovable con artists who nearly pull off one big old swindle and take over an ancient inaccessible kingdom in the Afghan mountains.This was a labor of love for John Huston. As a kid he read Rudyard Kipling's famous short story and it became his favorite work of fiction. Huston as far back as the Fifties wanted to film this first with Clark Gable and Humphrey Bogart and then later on with Richard Burton and Peter O'Toole. Try and picture this story done with either of those combinations.Huston even worked Kipling himself into the act with a fine small cameo by Christopher Plummer. Kipling who was a newspaper correspondent covering the British in India, is told this wild tale about what these two did in the forbidden land of Kaffiristan.These are the kind of people Kipling himself knew well from the British army in India which back in the day was its own entity and a great tradition of military glory albeit in an imperialist cause. For American audiences just think of Connery and Caine as a couple of GIs recently finished with their service.I think I understand their characters. What would Connery and Caine be back in civilian life if they returned to the United Kingdom? No one terribly important no doubt. They've spent time in India, learned a lot about the language and customs and want to turn some profit in it, doing something really big. It's a dream we can all identify with, but few of us have the gumption to see it through.Connery and Caine give some of their best screen performances in The Man Who Would Be king. This film became both a critical and box office success for John Huston, his first really big smash hit in a long time. It holds up well today and will for all time to come.",9,11,17,7 December 2006
Ghostbusters," Who You Gonna Call?
","When you've got uninvited paranormal guests or if you've accidentally intruded on them if you've acquired some haunted living space this film answers the question. Just who you going to call? Ghost Busters.It all begins innocently enough, parapsychologist Bill Murray has lost his grant money, his university won't let him stay on to conduct all kinds of experimentation. What to do?In Ghost Busters Bill Murray takes his knowledge and with a collection of some interesting colleagues, Dan Ackroyd, Harold Ramis, and Ernie Hudson forms his own outfit, the Ghost Busters. If you've got intruders from another dimension, they guarantee to get rid of them. They have a first interesting call from the public library at Bryant Park, that's a shakedown cruise for our heroes.But the real challenge comes from Sigourney Weaver who has all kinds of weird visitors including an ancient Hittite Goddess who emanates right from her refrigerator. That one Murray is going to give his personal attention.Ghost Busters busted a whole lot of box office back in the day and with good reason. It's a rollickingly funny comedy that doesn't quite come down to the level of Police Academy movies. These comedy veterans from the small screen know their business and they integrate their own personalities into a fine comic unit. A lot like the Crazy Gang comedies from the UK back in the day.Ghost Busters got two Oscar nominations for Special Effects and for its catchy title song. It's one of those you can't get out of your head once you've seen the film. In fact more than in most films, the song itself almost becomes a character in the film.It's one of the funniest films in the Eighties and it's one of those that spawned an equally funny sequel. Can't go wrong with either of them.",9,1,2,22 October 2009
Call Me by Your Name," Elio and Oliver
","James Ivory's screenplay for Call Me By Your Name brought home Oscar gold for
the film. It's a beautiful gay love story of two young men set and photographed
beautifully in the 80s in Northern Italy. The scenery alone is guaranteed to
bring out any romance in your soul.Professor Michael Stulberg and wife Amiri Cesar have invited a young teaching
assistant Armie Hammer to live with them and work on some excavations of
recent artifacts. Living with them is their most precocious and brilliant 17
year old son Timothee Chalamet who got an Oscar nomination as Best Actor.
The two of them have and do explore the opposite sex, but before the summer
is out they can't deny the physical attraction.Chalamet is as another reviewer said just completely beyond perfection. He's
the ideal twink boy who might have been your first crush. He's fortunate he
comes from educated parents who recognize what he is and let him go his own
way. How insightful they are we find out at the end.The rest of the characters outside of these four are as much background as the
scenery in northern Italy where the story takes place. The story just lasers right in on the family quartet. Watching the family dynamic as the parents
relate to Chalamet you also get sad when you realize how many uneducated
ones who were brought up to hate and fear gay crush the spirit of the Chalamets they bring into this world.The story ends on a sad note, but it also leaves open the plot elements for the
sequel already in the works.Call Me By Your Name also got nominated for Best Picture and for Best Original Song. It certainly has joined the pantheon of great gay cinema. I
hope the sequel is just as good.",8,0,2,21 March 2018
Gran Torino," Teaching The Work Ethic
","At the ripe old age of 78 Clint Eastwood is starting on a whole new career of playing tough old timers who are way past the day when they get the girl in their movies. Except as surrogate daughters which he's done in his past two films, four years apart though they be.In Million Dollar Baby Eastwood plays the gruff very blue collar fight manager Frank Dunn who takes on female prize fighter Hilary Swank and she becomes a surrogate daughter to him. In Gran Torino the process is somewhat reversed, Eastwood is a recently widowed retired auto worker Walt Kowalski, still living in the family home in Detroit in a rapidly changing neighborhood. In fact that neighborhood's been changing for decades, the latest influx being Asians. Despite his gruffness, his outright racism, Eastwood almost in spite of himself gets drawn into an Asian family of Hmong people and develops a father/children relationship with a brother and sister, Bee Vang and Ahney Her. He becomes closer to them than he is with his own children whom he feels have forgotten the American work ethic.Actor Clint Eastwood a veteran of over 50 years in film and television is a man who knows himself and knows the limits and changes that age and infirmity have placed upon him. As his most famous screen character so aptly remarked a man has to know his limitations. Director Clint Eastwood is nothing short of a genius in the performances he got from the two young Asian kids, both of whom were making their screen debuts and in fact from the rest of his Asian cast members, most of whom were new. Both the boy and the girl were just fabulous and so real as kids, not at all like Hollywood teen player types.And both kids face some very typical choices that all youngsters face today, especially those growing up in areas at or below the poverty line. Especially the boy who's being pressured to join a gang. Clint himself is facing old age issues, but he still mentors the kids and in the end does what a man's got to do.It took four years for actor Eastwood to reappear on the screen again. But it was worth the wait. With two back to back hits like Million Dollar Baby and Gran Torino, I just hope I don't have to wait another four years for Clint to reappear.",9,10,20,25 February 2009
The Longest Day," 'Gentlemen, We Start the War from Right Here.'
","Simply put if things had gone differently on June 6, 1944 we would be living in a very different and very much uglier world than we have now. The Longest Day is Darryl F. Zanuck's tribute to all who were involved in Allied invasion at Normandy.Even viewing it now as opposed to the theaters back then back then I am staggered at Zanuck's incredible eye and grasp for the detail of the Normandy invasion. He did the smart thing and not only bought Cornelius Ryan's standard account of D-Day, but got Ryan to write a very coherent screenplay. Even one who has absolutely no grasp of military history will be able to follow exactly what was going on.Several of the people who are portrayed in the film also served as technical advisers of it. When you Peter Lawford as Lord Lovat or Robert Ryan as General James Gavin and many others these people aided in recreating the project.Zanuck may have had the largest movie set in history to work with, at least up to that time. You are seeing the film photographed in the places it actually happened. The beaches, the towns of St. Mere Eglise and Ouisterham, even the embarkation areas in the UK. I doubt you could do The Longest Day today because of the changes in all these places now. Lots of cooperation from the British and French governments was necessary.You also couldn't do it because the budget would be the size of the U.S. national debt today. This was the last days of the all powerful studio system and even with a lot of the stars free-lancing at that point, Darryl F. Zanuck was still a most powerful man in Hollywood with a lot of favors owed. One example was Richard Burton who was shooting Cleopatra at the time The Longest Day was also shooting. For his two brief, but memorable scenes as an RAF pilot, they shot around him on Cleopatra also a 20th Century Fox production while he filmed his part for Zanuck.Even the Germans came in for a portrait of them as human beings. Curt Jurgens as General Blumentritt, who was also a technical adviser, put it philosophically best about how after he can't convince Chief of Staff Alfred Jodl to wake up Hitler to move the Panzer Divisions, breaks open a bottle of cognac and decides to drink it before the Allies arrive.I have several favorites in The Longest Day. Richard Todd who actually was at D-Day and was a decorated hero himself, plays commando leader, Major John Howard who is asked to paratroop into France and capture and hold a key bridge intact. Todd is channeling his own as well as Howard's war experience into the film and gives a performance of unusual depth.Norman Rossington and a pre-James Bond Sean Connery who was just making his debut as Bond in Dr. No, give some good comic relief as a cockney and Irish soldier landing on Sword Beach. So does Kenneth More as a British beachmaster with his bulldog Winston.The French are well represented by Arletty, Bourvil, Christian Marquand and by Irina Demich. Being that three of these play civilian roles they get the only two women's parts of any substance in The Longest Day. I do like the scene where some Germans checking Irina out in a low cut dress, fail to properly search her. Irina also demonstrates how much the women were equal partners in the Resistance. Marquand as a captain of a Free French company is involved in a particularly bloody battle for a coastal town.Of course the American cinema is well represented. Charlton Heston was to originally play the part that John Wayne does, but he couldn't get free of some commitments of his own and when Wayne became available, Zanuck grabbed him. Heston was later quoted as saying Wayne did a better job than he would have in any event. Wayne's best scene was when he saw some American bodies dangling from roofs in St. Mere Eglise. As I've said many times, John Wayne had one of the best faces for movie closeups ever. One look at the horror expressed in his face tells you all you need to know.Henry Fonda plays General Theodore Roosevelt, Jr. who would within a month after the invasion die on Normandy Beach. Had he lived, Roosevelt might have picked up the pieces of a stalled political career. But that was not to be the case. Roosevelt was found dead of a heart attack in his tent after the invasion when the Allies were trying to break out of the beach.The heaviest casualties on D-Day were on Omaha Beach where Robert Mitchum plays General Norman Cota a division commander. Mitchum is involved at the climax of the film where American GIS after being hung up for hours, break through and insure the invasion's success.The Longest Day is not only great drama and a great war film, but it is as accurate a film as you will ever get depicting the Normandy invasion, good history as well.",10,61,77,7 August 2006
Meet Joe Black," The Grim Reaper On Sabbatical
","The old Paramount classic Death Takes A Holiday gets a stylish turn of the 21st century remake, Meet Joe Black with Brad Pitt as the grim reaper himself taking a sabbatical to experience what he deprives everyone of, ultimately. The story has been updated from Italy during World War I to America in the new age of information.The guy who benefits for a short while is multimillionaire media tycoon Anthony Hopkins who is approaching his 65th birthday. He's a widower with two daughters, Marcia Gay Harden who is married to Jeffrey Tambor and Clare Forlani who's in love with love. In fact at the beginning of the film Clare who is a doctor has a chance meeting with Brad Pitt just before he's rundown in a busy New York street and the pale horseman takes over his body.It's a good thing Hopkins got this reprieve because there's some real nasty double-dealing taking place in his firm. His young right hand man, Jake Weber, is looking to affect a merger with another conglomerate that would ruin all that Hopkins has built in his life. But Weber of course hasn't the slightest idea who Hopkins's new ally is. Let alone the resources he can bring to bear.Meet Joe Black is a fine film which has a lot to say about the meaning of life and how important it is to use that time on earth in mortal form to become the best you can be. Pitt and Hopkins have very good chemistry and Webber is one of the slimier villains ever put on film.And see how it all works out for everyone in the end. In fact that's the real message of Meet Joe Black, it all does work out in the end.",8,6,9,28 May 2008
Slap Shot," Gonzo Hockey
","One of the knocks that has always been given to Paul Newman was that he was not right for comedy. When you're talking about stuff like A New Kind of Love or Rally Round the Flag Boys that's probably true. But Slapshot shows that what Paul Newman needed to be good for comedy was something not quite so sophisticated.Slapshot ain't Oscar Wilde, but it's not quite to the level of the Police Academy movies. It's just right for Paul Newman as the veteran player/coach with a team of misfits from one of hockey's minor leagues who's forever looking for a break from the majors.The Charlestown Chiefs who seem to be the hockey equivalent of the New York Mets are having a perennial losing season. The town itself is one flush away from despondency with a mill that was the main employer in the town shutting down. That means the paltry attendance the Chiefs already have will diminish more. It's an uncertain future.So with nothing to lose, Newman's boys turn the sport into a hockey facsimile of the World Wrestling Federation. In no other sport are fights among the players so accepted. But Newman ratchets it up to an exponential level. And his team actually starts to win and the Charlestown Chiefs become a gate attraction. There's a lot more to the resolution of the team's problems, but that championship game is unforgettable. All Hail the Brothers Hanson.",7,21,27,18 December 2005
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Some Interesting Taste In Men
","After seeing the first Twilight movie all I can say is that Kristen Stewart's character Bella has some real weird tastes in men. First a vampire and now a werewolf, YEEGADS.This series of books has become most popular with the current young generation and I can see why. Bella is certainly breaking traditions and questioning certain mores and norms of society to say the least. But the films wouldn't work if you didn't have beautiful and attractive people in the leads who also can be romantic on screen.That she has in her vampire lover Robert Pattinson. Pattinson and Stewart really do click on screen and their performances make you believe in both Twilight and New Moon.In the previous film, a third character, a young American Indian kid played by Taylor Lautner is seen and he first clues Stewart in that her inamorata isn't quite human. He likes Stewart also, but from a distance.But when Pattinson leaves her because he feels the romance can't be, Lautner moves on in. But he's got a big old secret himself. He's got a werewolf gene in him and it's these werewolves that have protected his tribe from the vampire clan that Pattinson belongs to.I really did admire the special effects, especially those that turned Lautner and his friends into some really convincing large wolves. They do take care of business quite expeditiously. New Moon does its best in the special effects and the romance department. Those who've read the books know what's coming next, we filmmakers can only anticipate.",7,3,13,23 December 2009
Patton," The Heart And Soul Of General Patton
","Even with George C. Scott loudly saying that he would refuse the Academy Award should it be given him for Best Actor of 1970, so dominating and domineering is his portrayal, I'm not sure the Academy had any other choice. He's that good in the part.You watch Patton it's like watching a wide screen color newsreel of World War II from the George S. Patton point of view. The film takes you from Patton taking over the II Corps in the North African desert after the defeat at Kasserine Pass right through V.E. day and after.All the things that contribute to Patton's legend are brought to life, his achievements, his braggadocio, even those character flaws that allowed for no weakness in others, we see in full view. Scott really got inside the heart and soul of General Patton. Patton had an uncomfortable knack of living up to his billing, at least it was uncomfortable enough for his critics. The only other role of substance and this is really the only weakness of the film is that of Karl Malden as Omar Bradley. Though personality wise they were as far apart as you can get, in real life and in the movie they had great respect and even affection for each other. The other personalities of World War II appear mostly as paste board figures, maybe with the exception of Edward Binns as Walter Bedell Smith, Eisenhower's hard-nosed chief of staff.Ike is never seen in the film yet he looms over the action as an unseen presence of great wisdom. Wisdom Ike had indeed, after that soldier slapping incident in Sicily, it took considerable guts for Ike to bring Patton back. Patton the film came out a year after Ike's death and he had and still has wellsprings of affection that run deep with the American public.Patton's finest hour was at the Battle of the Bulge in the relief of the 101st Airborne at Bastogne. His relief there, accomplished within 48 hours and racing north in France during the freezing winter, broke the back of Hitler's last gambit for a negotiated peace instead of an unconditional surrender. He said he'd do it and did it, there was never a question about his ability after that.I first saw the film during basic training in Fort Polk, Louisiana. That line during Scott's opening speech shoveling manure in Louisiana never failed to bring the house down.Scott in refusing the Oscar did a very classy thing. He donated the Oscar to the Patton Museum in Fort Campbell, Kentucky.George S. would be proud of George C.",9,10,16,21 June 2007
La Grande Illusion," 'German Or French, duty is duty'
","Although World War I was one of the great exercises in futility hence the title of this film, Grand Illusion sustains the proposition that people do not like being prisoners, be it wartime or for civilian offenses. That they will try to escape is inevitable.Consider John Sturges classic The Great Escape. Unlike these French prisoners in the first World War in the second these people want to get back and get into the fight against an enemy of civilization itself. Jean Gabin and his peers just want out of a new escape proof prison camp which is an old castle replete with battlements and turrets and quite a drop to the ground. Their host at the citadel prison camp is Erich Von Stroheim who is similarly disillusioned.Von Stroheim strikes up a friendship of sorts with Pierre Fresnay who unlike his two fellow planners in escape is a professional soldier just like Von Stroheim. Fresnay is of the aristocracy and Von Stroheim is a German Junker, the landed gentry of which Otto Von Bismarck was the chief representative. Fresnay's death scene is quite touching.The three amigos among the prisoners are Gabin who is a working class stiff, Fresnay, and Marcel Dalio who is Jewish and has some wealth to him, but because of his religion can't crack the French upper crust. Fresnay's death allows Gabin and Dalio to break free from Von Stroheim's custody. What happens then is as Paul Harvey used to say, the rest of the story.One part of that story is Dita Parlo, a German farm woman who inexplicably shelters them. Her family has been decimated by the First World War and she also has few illusions. What goes on with Gabin and her could never be shown in Hollywood because of the omnipresent Code. But this is the French cinema and the plain fact is the woman has needs and Gabin looks more than capable of fulfilling them. Nothing that frank would EVER have been shown on the American cinema of the time.If there were an Oscar category for Best Foreign Language film in 1938, Grand Illusion probably would have won. As it was it was given a rare honor of being a nominee for Best Picture that year, but lost to You Can't Take It With You. Jean Renoir was sadly ignored for Best Director however. Still Grand Illusion remains quite the high point in his career and that of Jean Gabin. After over 70 years it still is a classic in both entertainment and in message content.",9,1,1,28 June 2011
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," He 'Youthens'
","Other than F. Scott Fitzgerald's vivid description of how Benjamin Button has reversed the aging process in his life, there is nothing of his the plot of his story. But the idea behind the updated version is as vivid as when he put it to paper.When Fitzgerald published the story it was 1927 probably at the height of the jazz age and his creative powers. As he wrote it, Bnejamin Button was born after the Civil War and lived through World War I. But he lived backwards as it were. In Camelot, King Arthur describes Merlin as not aging, but that he 'youthens'. That coined word describes just what happens to Benjamin.When he's born he comes out of the womb a little old man, something like you might imagine Yoda if you can ever imagine him as a child. With all the usual problems of old age. But as he grows older chronologically, Benjamin loses all those infirmities gradually and gets younger and younger. Several actors play him before he finally morphs into Brad Pitt.Which makes the achievement of director David Fancher all the more impressive. Although Brad Pitt was recognized with an Oscar nomination for Best Actor, the directing of several others almost in tandem to play the same role at different stages is a great achievement. Too bad he didn't get the Oscar for that alone although Fancher was nominated also.In fact The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button got a flock of Oscar nominations including Best Picture as well as those mentioned. It won for Art&Set Direction, Visual Effects, and in fact if it hadn't won for makeup the Oscars should have been picketted that year.Taraji Henson was also nominated for Best Supporting Actress. When Benjamin is born and his mother dies giving him birth and his father abandons him, the caregiver who is black takes him in to raise in her large and extended family. Given both his physical condition and the circumstances of his childhood, Benjamin had one unique perspective on life indeed. Henson is nothing short of fabulous in her portrayal.Cate Blanchett who was overlooked in the Oscars for this role plays the woman whom he loves, but who is working her way up in physical age while Pitt is working down. The film is seen from both her's and his perspective as she tells her daughter to read from this diary that Benjamin kept. When they met at the middle though as Benjamin ran the bases backward through life, there love was real and really physical.The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button is a remarkable achievement that gave some career roles to some fine players.",8,2,3,11 July 2010
Wimbledon," The downslope of his career
","Wimbledon is the story of a pair of tennis players, 119th ranked Paul Bettany who is on the down slope of his career and young and up and coming Kirsten Dunst. Sounds like the recipe for a tennis version of A Star Is Born, but it doesn't quite work out that way.Bettany has seen his better days and is picked as a wild card seed for the Wimbledon tournament the goal of every British player. The younger and faster and stronger players are getting all the media attention, players like young Ms. Dunst over in the United Kingdom with her father Sam Neill keeping a watchful eye.Like Norman and Esther these two mismatched players fall in love, but this Norman Maine does not fall into dissipation. With her encouragement he forces a second wind for his career and finds himself miracle of miracles in the finals.You say these things don't happen in real life, but every now and then they do as Ron Howard's Cinderella Man attests, the real life story of Jim Braddock. In tennis I remember a much past the prime Jimmy Connors winning that last major tournament before packing it in.Audiences love a comeback story and Dunst and Bettany are an appealing pair.",5,1,3,7 February 2014
Lincoln," 'These dead shall not have died in vain'
","Stephen Spielberg did some meticulous research or maybe I should say that Doris Kearns Goodwin did some for him when she wrote her best seller Team Of Rivals about Lincoln and his Cabinet during the Civil War. Otherwise Lincoln the film wouldn't be a film destined to win a lot of awards next year. Spielberg had it all down, including the club foot that Thaddeus Stevens had.By the time that 1865 rolled around a most war weary public just wanted an end and they could see it in sight with Grant battering Lee in Virginia and taking some heavy casualties every time out and Sherman coming up from Georgia through the Carolinas after Joe Johnston. However the man in the White House had a deeper concern, he wanted something out of the war, something lasting. Like an end to slavery once and for all.So with the Confederates looking to salvage their Slaveocracy and sending peace commissioners and the Radical Republicans like Charles Sumner in the Senate and Thaddeus Stevens in the House wanting abolition once and for all, Lincoln steered a tricky course through public opinion to get the 13th amendment to the Constitution abolishing slavery.In a nutshell the film Lincoln is about one of the lines from his famous Gettysburg Address. Abraham Lincoln wanted to know in his heart that the people he memorialized, who lay beneath the soil at Gettysburg, died for a noble purpose. As he said on that occasion, 'these dead shall not have died in vain'.Not everyone in politics is in it for anything noble however and the President of the United States had more in the way of patronage to make things happen that he wanted. God only knows for instance what Lyndon Johnson had to offer to bring a few votes along to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Not everyone voted for that strictly to memorialize the late John F. Kennedy. Lincoln was an old hand at that from his years in Illinois. Daniel Day-Lewis and Sally Field make a splendid Abe and Mary Lincoln and Spielberg gave us enough of a view of the home life at the White House with the two surviving sons. Robert Lincoln who was more his mother's son than his father's except he inherited Lincoln's ability as a lawyer wanted very much to serve in the Civil War. But Mary Lincoln lost her two boys between Robert and Tad and did not want to lose her oldest in the war. So Robert unlike his father who studied law by candlelight and clerked, got a Harvard education instead. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Robert and young Gulliver McGrath plays the mischievous Thomas Todd 'Tad' Lincoln.Of the supporting cast Thaddeus Stevens as played by Tommy Lee Jones is most memorable. Stevens who unofficially led the Radicals was a man way ahead of his time. His 'housekeeper' was a black woman with whom he had two daughters whom he could not marry because of miscegenation laws. He wanted full equality for all and did not care who knew it. Later on he led the effort to impeach Lincoln's successor Andrew Johnson who as Vice President-elect plays no role here as most Vice Presidents do. That whole story is told albeit with a different historical slant in the film Tennessee Johnson with Van Heflin as Johnson and Lionel Barrymore as Stevens. I think the only question remaining is how many Oscars Lincoln will pick up next year.",10,6,13,1 December 2012
Kelly's Heroes," Proper Motivation
","Kelly's Heroes is a film that puts forth the notion that with proper motivation, soldiers will perform all kinds of heroic deeds in battle. Of course I don't think that West Point or any of the other military academies had the kind of motivation that this film gives Clint Eastwood and the collection of GIs he assembles for a caper.Clint Eastwood as Private Joe Kelly interrogates a captured German Colonel and learns of a stash of gold bullion in the town of Clermont which is behind enemy lines and a place that General Carroll O'Connor is anxious to capture. Sixteen million dollars in bullion and as proof Eastwood is given a bar of it as a sample by the inebriated Colonel.As the war seems to be at a stall, Eastwood decides to grab the gold for himself and some trusted confederates. I don't think he thought this thing through, the problem of hiding it and fencing it assuming you capture it is not really discussed. And of course the stuff is behind the enemy lines.But where O'Connor can't move, Eastwood finds a way because he's motivated. His crew also gets larger and larger and pretty soon there won't be enough to share.Kelly's Heroes is an interesting war comedy/drama with a real twist for an ending that I won't even give a hint of. Director Brian Hutton assembled a nice cast of familiar and soon to be familiar names to support Clint. My favorite is Donald Sutherland as the Sherman tank commander nicknamed Oddball and it's an apt moniker. Sutherland is a hippie born 20 years too soon, but definitely a character who would have been appreciated by the film audiences of the Seventies.Such favorites as Don Rickles and Telly Savalas and Stuart Margolin are all in on Eastwood's caper. This is one fun movie.But an odd choice for a Memorial Day showing celebrating the fighting spirit of the American soldiers who died in battle on TCM.",8,3,4,25 May 2009
Million Dollar Baby," It Doesn't Get Better Than This
","I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life. It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank. Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.This film will be a classic hundreds of years from now. We can all learn some life lessons from Million Dollar Baby.",10,9,12,17 May 2008
Donnie Brasco," The Biggest Mutt In The History Of The Mafia
","With only one real scene of violence and mayhem in the film, Donnie Brasco relies far more on character development in a story of two men and the planned betrayal of one by another in the line of duty.Johnny Depp plays real life FBI undercover agent Joe Pistone who infiltrates the Bonano crime family through the good offices of Lefty Ruggiero, a small time Mafia button man played by Al Pacino. During the five years undercover, Pistone who used the alias of Donnie Brasco was responsible for about 200 federal indictments because of the work he did. It took a terrible strain on him and his family as the film so aptly demonstrates.It must have been like old home week for Johnny Depp who made his acting bones playing a youthful undercover cop in the television series 21 Jump Street. But the difference between Officer Tom Hanson going undercover for a couple of weeks at some high school and agent Pistone living and working with the wise guys for five years afraid of being found out is the difference between Donald Duck and Donald Trump.Depp's performance as Pistone/Brasco is conveyed as much by body language and closeups as with dialog. He'd like very much to return to his wife and three daughters and live a normal life, but the demands of the job make it impossible. According to Wikipedia's article on Pistone he was uniquely qualified for his undercover assignment having lived and grown up among wise guys in New Jersey. He was familiar with all the Mafia culture and could blend in easily. The strain shows on him in his scenes with wife Anne Heche, only someone with a real gift for acting could make those scenes so real.Depp is matched by Al Pacino as the luckless Lefty Ruggiero. In the Mafia code he vouches for Depp and if Depp betrays trust in any way, Pacino's marked for death.Lefty Ruggiero is a hired killer with as he boasts 27 contract kills to his credit. Yet he's also a family man with a lot of problems as is Depp. Even though the man is in fact evil, Pacino does make him a likable sort. It's why Depp is dreading the day he's out from undercover because it means certain death for a man who's grown to be his friend. Except when the crew that Depp and Pacino are part of do ambush a rival group before in fact they do it to them, Donnie Brasco is a fairly non violent film for a gangster story. Donnie Brasco emphasizes character development and a good script as opposed to bloody mayhem.I think you'll like the story about a man who turned a friend into the biggest mutt in the history of the Mafia.",8,58,77,20 February 2007
Casualties of War," Soldier With A Conscience
","Although Platoon may have gotten more acclaim, by far the best film on the Vietnam War is this one. Casualties Of War is going to leave Platoon way in the dust when history has its verdict.Though Sean Penn's got several great films to his credit, by far this is the best work of Michael J. Fox on the big screen. His soldier with a conscious who can't live with himself after witnessing an act of barbarity that the other men of his squad commit should have brought him an Oscar nomination. In fact there could have and should have been a few of them for this film. Fox plays a young soldier only a few weeks in Vietnam. On patrol Sergeant Sean Penn saves his life, but then on a second patrol because Penn and friends could not get leave to bleed the lizard as they say, they kidnap a young Vietnamese woman and take her on patrol. All the men on the patrol, Penn, Don Harvey, John C. Reilly, and John Leguizamo all gang rape the girl, but Fox refuses. Later on he's got a crisis of conscience.Kids who grew up on World War II movies and westerns with clearly defined good and bad guys were ill prepared for a war in Vietnam. So was our government which had been involved in more or less degree since the end of World War II and the breakup of French Indochina. The subtleties of the regional politics eluded our policy makers in Washington. It was mighty hard to tell who was a friend and who was an enemy. You treated anyone with a yellowish pigmentation and slanted eyes as an enemy, the only friends you knew were the ones wearing the same green jungle fatigues as you were.The war twisted Penn and Harvey. Leguizamo and Reilly were essentially followers, only Fox who hadn't been there long enough to have his sense of morality impaired could see this was all wrong. That's the frightening part of Casualties Of War. None of the four could see anything wrong, even Leguizamo who sees his first duty as to stick with the guys who have your back in the field.As good as Fox and Penn and the rest of the Occidental cast is, the best performance in the film is Thuy Thu Lee. As the bewildered and frightened young girl she will positively break your heart with her one and only film performance.Casualties Of War was shot in Thailand so we're seeing actual Southeast Asia locations. Brian DePalma's direction of his stellar cast is right on target. Don't ever miss Casualties Of War about the ultimate Vietnam experience.",10,42,49,14 November 2008
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Bruno And Shmuel
","I can't speak for other people, but for me The Boy In The Striped Pyjamas is a film that can be seen once and once only because the impact is so shattering. Not even a stone statue can be not moved by this film, this child's eye view of the Holocaust.Bruno is an 8 year old German kid whose father David Thewlis is an officer in the Wehrmacht. They're living a nice life in the beginning of World War II in metropolitan Berlin. Thewlis gets orders however shipping him to a command in a nice rural area of southern Germany, presumably Bavaria. Like any other kid he's upset at being dislocated from his friends and his school, but he certainly hasn't much to say in the matter.So the family is uprooted to a lovely pastoral area where Dad's been put in charge of a concentration camp. Not one of the bigger ones like Auschwitz and Dachau, but a small one that his superiors expect Thewlis to run efficiently. Young Bruno has absolutely no one to play with and he wanders over to the camp. His parents feel he's way too young to understand about these things and he makes friends with a kid on the other side of the barbed wire, a young Jewish boy named Shmuel who wears those funny striped pyjamas like everyone else in the camp.Two things struck me about The Boy In The Striped Pyjamas. When I did a review of The Diary Of Anne Frank, the biggest impression I got out of the film was the ordinariness of that small group of Jews hidden in that attic. Who could possibly think these people were any kind of threat to civilization simply for being and believing in their faith? We get to see the other side of the looking glass here, a view of this very average German family, besides young Bruno and Thewlis, there's mother Vera Famiga and daughter Amber Beattie. Famiga is not happy one bit with her domestic situation and it's slowly dawning on her that the politics and policies of the Third Reich is the root of her concerns. As for Beattie, she's really buying into the whole Nazi thing, partly because she's going through puberty and a young and handsome aide to her father played by Rupert Friend is stirring up those first womanly feelings.But to all intents and purposes this is your average German family, not too much different than the Frank family in that attic, but that this regime of hate has made Thewlis a death merchant.The second thing that struck me and it's what gives hope to this crazy world is what passes between Asa Butterfield as Bruno and Jack Scanlon as Shmuel. If all we are as humans are reflections of our parents prejudices there would be absolutely no hope for mankind. But we do grow, we do question, some of us just don't accept everything that's fed to us. We don't see Shmuel's world of the camp until the very end, the boys mostly have contact with a barbed wire fence between them. But we see Bruno and his sister being now home schooled in Nazi teachings and his innocent contact with that kid on the other side of the fence makes him question what's going on.The Boy In The Striped Pyjamas is one of the best films of 2008. You will not forget the performances of Butterfield and Scanlon and the adult cast members. The end will shatter your mind, but the film's depiction of friendship growing in the worst possible circumstances is also a message of hope.",10,4,9,5 January 2009
The Imitation Game," The Enigmatic Man
","The British Official Secrets act prevented me as a kid growing up about Alan Turing. I would certainly have liked to know about him in my formative years on many levels. Over a 100 years after his birth he's a role model for gay geeks everywhere, but in his lifetime he would not have been known beyond his field of Mathematics.Benedict Cumberbatch plays the enigmatic man Alan Turing who many consider the founder of computer science. He was also a tortured gay man in those days when sodomy laws were strictly enforced. A respected professor of Mathematics he volunteers for the war effort. Not satisfied with how codebreaking efforts were going he goes right to the top and the sheer brass and effrontery persuade Winston Churchill to put this man in charge.I doubt Winston Churchill knew much more about what Alan Turing was talking about than I would now. But sometimes genius will out in just the way it's presented. I only wish we had gotten to see Churchill's reaction to Turing's now famous letter.As we well know now with what has been declassified how Turing and his picked crew broke the Nazi code and with some well used and specific intelligence at propitious moments we were able to win the war in Europe. Part of that crew is Keira Knightley who wins a battle for feminism to be accepted in this all male bastion. Keira and Ben's scenes have some real emotion to them. He confesses he's gay and she would still like to marry him as fascinated as she is by his sheer intellect. Cumberbatch made the right decision as so many gay men today still make the wrong one. He decides that marriage will just spread the heartache he has in not being able to live openly and proudly with whom he loves. For her role Keira Knightley got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress.When different players play the same individual at different stages of life I've thought that some recognition is due. In flashback scenes to Turing's prep school days we see the understated but beautifully played romantic involvement of Alex Lawther as young Turing and Jack Bannon as Christopher Morcum. Those two juveniles are nothing short of magnificent in what they do with the part. Young Morcum's death while still in prep school was a secret heartache he carried for the rest of his life.The Imitation Game got several other Oscar nominations including Best Picture and took home one Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay. The saddest thing about Alan Turing is that he's one of a handful of people who ever existed of whom it could be said he bent the course of history and in his life he could receive no recognition for it. In fact we do see what did happen to him post World War II. Now his nation and the world can appreciate him for what he was and what he did.",9,6,10,1 April 2015
Caddyshack," Heavy duty humor
","Golf and those who play it becomes the subject of some heavy duty humor in
Caddyshack. Some of the funniest folks in the last half of the last century are
involved with Caddyshack.With many little subplots going the main plot involves the rivalry between the
head of the club Ted Knight who is also a judge and Rodney Dangerfield who is
a filthy rich and brash visitor. Dangerfield is his usually cheerful and obnoxious character, but he presses Knight's buttons. Some of the funniest
moments of the film is Knight reacting to Dangerfield. Chevy Chase is an interesting fellow himself, a rather iconoclastic character who doesn't even keep score as he explains his philosophy of life to young
Michael O'Keefe who is one of the caddies just trying to pick up some extra
dollars and suck up to the rich who are regulars at the club.Knight reminds me of the character of the father of the prospective bride whom Auntie Mame was desperately trying to keep nephew Patrick from
marrying. Willard Waterman in Auntie Mame was not on his home ground
and Rosalind Russell capitalizes on that. You see Knight on his home turf (no pun intended) but it yields him no advantage as Dangerfield just shows him 
up over and over.We cannot forget Bill Murray who is an iconoclastic character in his own right.
He's one of the groundskeepers and has been assigned the task of ridding the
world of gopher who has taken residence at the country club and leaving inconvenient holes in the ground. It's a battle of wits and guess who comes
out on top?Henry Wilcoxon plays a Catholic bishop who likes to golf. He isn't exactly Father O'Malley moved up in the ranks. Wilcoxon is best known for all the
Cecil B. DeMille films he did and his final scene has a DeMille like quality. With the gopher character Caddyshack expertly blends animation with the live
players. Big kudos go out to the animators for the gopher.Don't expect any sophistication, but Caddyshack will give you lots of belly laughs with many to spare",8,1,3,29 May 2018
The Last Emperor," Heaven's Mandate
","Back when I was a university student studying a course in the Far East  we learned the term 'Heaven's Mandate'. It was said that when one  dynasty overthrew another, the mandate from powers above to rule China  had been lost and a new mandate was given to the winners. It was a self  fulfilling idea because if the Mings went out and the Manchus went in  it was because the Manchus now had the Mandate.  The Last Emperor is the story of Young emperor Pu Yi who was the last  Manchu Emperor, crowned at the age of 3 in 1908 and removed in 1911  during the revolution. Pu Yi spent half the rest of his life trying to  gain that back and the other half trying to roll with the punches for  making some very bad choices in trying for the former. By that time if  you want to extend the idea, the mandate now fell to Mao Tse-tung and  the Chinese Communists.  Still very few people had as colorful, as tumultuous, and as epic a  life as Pu Yi as portrayed by Chinese actor John Lone. Whatever else Pu  Yi was, he was a survivor and maybe if he hasn't got Heaven's mandate  any more, he's at least got a heavenly place.  From 1911 until he was kicked out, the young Emperor was still  permitted to run a kind of fairyland kingdom in the Forbidden City area  of Peking which was the exclusive domain of the Chinese Emperors for  centuries. During that time he had an English tutor in Peter O'Toole,  the one major occidental player in The Last Emperor. The relationship  here is similar to the one shown in Seven Years In Tibet between Brad  Pitt as Heinrich Harrer and the young Dalai Lama. Here though the  emphasis is on the pupil not the tutor.  The Last Emperor is an epic international achievement, not possible  during the years of Mao Tse-tung's rule. As a film it received great  international respect winning nine Oscars including Best Picture and  Best Director for Bernardo Bertolucci. That's quite a mandate in and of  itself.  Though the film is more than two and half hours long I guarantee your  interest will not flag. And it really is worth it to see at the very  end the elderly Emperor's meeting with the new Red Guards of Mao's  Cultural Revolution and that bit of symbolism with the cricket.  Absolutely priceless, just as the film is.",10,7,11,18 May 2008
Jerry Maguire," 'You Complete Me'
","If Jerry Maguire were made 30 years earlier I can see Jack Lemmon playing the title role. You wouldn't think of Tom Cruise being up for parts that Jack Lemmon would have been cast for, but he does an incredible job in the role of go-getter sports agent Maguire who decides to leave the high pressure agency that Jay Mohr runs and going out on his own.Cruise has one of those chew the scenery moments when he leaves Mohr's office and secretary Renee Zellweger decides to leave with him. She's been crushing out on him for the longest time even though he's been seeing Kelly Preston. But patience can certainly be its own reward sometime.If Jerry Maguire lacks something it would probably be Billy Wilder's surefire wit and sense of satire. Jerry Maguire would have been a great film for him to write and direct. Satire however might have crowded out romance in a Wilder film.And it's romance that the movie going public likes with Tom Cruise. Some of his and Renee Zellweger's best scenes are with little Jonathan Lipnicki who is her son from a previous marriage. The kid is a scene stealer, mainly because he acts like a real kid, not some Hollywood creation.Cruise has some tough sledding at first, one client he had counted on was college sensation Jerry O'Connell who is being inundated with draft offers and endorsements. O'Connell and his family, despite the whole honest country boy shtick, do disappoint him.His one client who does stick with him is Cuba Gooding Jr. who plays Rod Tidwell, a running back for the Phoenix Suns. Tidwell's one egotistical handful and Gooding won a deserved Best Supporting Actor Oscar. However the reason he won it is that his portrayal of Tidwell is multidimensional. His scenes with wife Regina King and the rest of his family are far removed from the Muhammed Ali like face he shows the public.Cruise also was nominated for Best Actor in the title role. But he lost to Geoffrey Rush for Shine. In fact Jerry Maguire lost for Best Picture to The English Patient. I was pulling for Tom that year myself.Though I think a lot of Billy Wilder type satire was missed, Jerry Maguire is still a very well done film. Maybe it needed a Billy Wilder to direct it.",9,4,7,24 November 2007
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Dark Chocolate
","As per usual the team of Johnny Depp and director Tim Burton can always be counted on to deliver from the dark-side. Thus it is with this remake of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory though this was actually done under its original title.Depp expands his list of quirky characters and expands his range which I think is bigger than any other player around today. His chocolate magnate Willy Wonka is a dark character, so different than Gene Wilder back in the day. His character is great, but it might have frightened a few little tykes going to a family film.The story is basically the same, young Charlie Buckets a kid from a poor and extended family where both sets of grandparents are all under one roof. He lives in a town where years ago all the human workers were given the sack from the Wonka Chocolate Factory and it became fully automated. What grief he must have gotten from organized labor can only be imagined.Anyway Wonka who's become so obsessed with being the Chocolate King he's got no family and no heirs. We're not even sure, but that he might be celibate. He's put five gold tickets in one of his millions of Wonka Bars and the lucky five kids who get them win a trip inside his factory where no one has been.Charlie turns out to be one of the five and accompanied by his grandfather and the other kids and their guardians he takes a magical tour of the place. They meet the little tribe of Oompa-Loompas who live and work in the factory.Freddie Highmore is an earnest young Charlie. I do miss Jack Albertson as the grandfather from the first film. He registers far better than David Kelly in this one.The film really is a star vehicle for Johnny Depp, more so than the first film was for Gene Wilder. You'll like it, it's like biting into that first Wonka Bar.",8,3,7,28 June 2008
The Adjustment Bureau," If Our Fates Are Predetermined.................................
","Matt Damon, who looks and sounds in this film like another of the Kennedy clan as befitting his Boston background, stars in The Adjustment Bureau as a would be US Senator from New York State. He's just lost a race, but is looking eagerly for a comeback. And he's met whom he considers his soul-mate, promising young ballerina Emily Blunt. So what is wrong with this picture?If you are of religious bent and are a conspiratorial theorist than you've waited all your life for a film like The Adjustment Bureau. The Christian Faith's central tenet is that the broad march of human history is predetermined and it would follow that those of us who are leaders of some kind also have a predetermined path to follow. The Adjustment Bureau is a group of supernatural beings who move and work among us, guiding us in their own way to those paths.One of the Adjustment Bureau beings, Anthony Mackie, missed a cue and Damon and Blunt meet again and develop an attraction. This is not part of the master plan for the human race so for whatever reason we've got to keep them apart.The film is an interesting and unique concept that doesn't quite know the conclusions it wants you to reach. Damon and Blunt are sincere and more than capable as the young lovers who someone upstairs is not willing to see together. Damon's problem is more unique, he actually stumbled upon the existence of this Adjustment Bureau and he gets more set in his ways to have Blunt come what may.Where is God in all this? According to the film he's not in a separate and faraway place called heaven, but he's right here among us in the trenches of our everyday lives. If the message is a bit muddled, The Adjustment Bureau is still entertaining and interesting.",7,2,5,27 August 2011
Rudy," The Fighting Irish's Leprechaun
","Sean Astin stars in the true story of Daniel E. Ruettiger, aka Rudy who wanted more than anything else to play for Notre Dame's legendary Fighting Irish football team. To be part of the legend that is Notre Dame, the legend of Knute Rockne, George Gipp, The Four Horsemen, Frank Leahy, Johnny Lujack, Terry Brennan right up to when Astin entered the college with Ara Parseghian as the coach.The right actor was cast in the lead, Sean Astin is short, but built like outdoor brick lavatory. Good enough for high school football where only a very few go on to college on athletic scholarships and those are big guys who might just make it in the professional leagues. But in Indiana, especially around South Bend, it's Notre Dame which is the be all, end all for football. Very similar in culture that way to southern towns, but with a Catholic twist to it.We see young Rudy listening to records of Knute Rockne's fighting speeches and imitating them. If memory serves the one he's listening to is the same one Pat O'Brien used in Knute Rockne - All American. Astin actually makes the team when he impresses everyone with his grit and heart. And he proves to be more than a mascot type, he's an inspiration to his teammates and to the audience watching Rudy.Look for fine performances from Ned Beatty as his blue collar father, Robert Prosky as a sympathetic priest/member of the Notre Dame faculty and Charles S. Dutton who is maintenance worker and former member of the Fighting Irish fallen on some hard times.Rudy's a very old fashioned film, the kind Hollywood used to make in abundance, but sadly not any more. Great viewing for football fans of all ages.",7,0,1,5 January 2010
Avengers: Age of Ultron," That spirit of fun
","If there were not an audience for Marvel comic heroes than clearly these films would not be made, to answer one other reviewer although I sympathize with him somewhat. The world is indeed an infinitely more complex place than the world of Marvel comics with clearly identifiable heroes and villains. But I get the feeling that from Robert Downey, Jr. on down the organizer and prime mover as Iron Man behind the Avengers these players do love doing these roles because it's a lot of fun. If they didn't show that spirit of fun to the audience than these films would never be made.So in that spirit of fun Avengers: Age Of Ultron comes before us and everyone looks like they're having a good time saving the world. A computer program got loose and took form in this dimension named Ultron and James Spader who is completely unrecognizable is running amuck in the earth. No doubt Star Trek fans took notice that this guy's mission is to cleanse the earth much like that old earth probe NOMAD which got its programming mixed up in that classic Star Trek prime story. Wouldst Captain James T. Kirk of the Enterprise had a crew like Downey has at his command.My favorite is always Chris Evans because of the whole cast he best gets into the spirit of being a superhero. Of all of them, he's already played two superheroes, Captain America and Johnny Storm the Human Torch. I'll be before he's done Evans will play a couple of more as long as the money's good and he enjoys it.Pretend you're a kid again and enjoy, don't take it so seriously.",6,5,13,29 June 2015
Quiz Show," 'We Want A Guy Who Looks Like He Can Order A Table At 21.'
","I remember back in the day when the scandal of the rigged quiz shows came to public attention, in one of his monologues Bob Hope said that with all the investigations uncovering all the crooked doings on television the most honest thing on there was professional wrestling.It was quite the scandal back in the day, the producing team of Barry and Enright were far from the only ones rigging their shows. In one fell swoop nearly all the television quiz shows went off the air. For a long time the only ones you saw on television were Concentration, Password, and The Price is Right and none of them were for the big money that 21 and others were giving out.Poor Charles Van Doren he was just ahead of his time without knowing it. Today a guy like Herbert Stempel would never make it through the screening process. But he did back in the day and therein lies the tale.I remember it well from my childhood. Herbert Stempel, nerdy ex-GI who probably was a Democrat who voted for Ike just ain't cutting it on the Nielsen ratings. They need someone with glamor and when Charles Van Doren, scion of one of America's most glittering family of intellectuals and folks who were definitely madly for Adlai tries out for one of the Barry-Enright Quiz Shows, they think they've found their star. Stempel gets promised all kinds of stuff to throw the show, but his promises are welshed on. That does not sit too well with Stempel who starts protesting loud and long to the Grand Jury in New York County and finally to the Halls of Congress. Van Doren and his family are disgraced.I remember the attention given to the real Charles Van Doren. A matin√©e idol professor, he looked to have a golden future. I could have easily seen him running for public office at some point had the scandal never occurred.John Turturro as Stempel and Ralph Fiennes as Van Doren ring true to their characters, especially Fiennes as I remember Van Doren. There was an Oscar nomination for Paul Scofield who played Charles's father Mark Van Doren and Rob Morrow does very well as Richard Goodwin the Congressional investigator who reluctantly brings down a great liberal hero to be.Robert Redford did a great job recreating a forgotten piece of Americana and the times that accompanied it. After all, it's only show business.",8,1,3,23 November 2006
Major League," Miracle On The Cuyahoga
","Major League was six years too early in its prophecy for success for the Cleveland Indians. I'm old enough to remember when they had a good team back in the Fifties. When I was just a small kid, large Municipal Stadium known without affection as mistake on the lake used to have 70,000 plus crowds because the Indians had such players as Bob Feller, Lou Boudreau, Joe Gordon, and Satchel Paige. But when that team went bad, the larger the stadium and they had the largest in baseball looked all the more empty.Terry Pluto wrote a book on the history of the Indians failure called The Curse Of Colavito. In 1959 the Indians finished a respectable second to the White Sox in the pennant race that year with Casey Stengel's Yankees having an inexplicable bad season and a distant third. Rocky Colavito led the American League in home runs and he was the most popular fellow in Cleveland. He became one of a select group of Major Leaguers that year to hit four home-runs in one game. And he was traded to the Detroit Tigers for the batting champion, Harvey Kuenn. It was never the same for Cleveland. Which takes us to the futile Indians of 1989 as futile in real life as they start on screen. The team comes into the possession of a new owner former showgirl Margaret Whitton. Her contract with the city specifies that if the team attendance dips below 700,000 for the season, she can move the team and she wants the warm sun of Miami instead of winters on the Cuyahoga River.Building a winning team in baseball is a lot harder than what you see in Major League. But this collection of goofballs, misfits, and has beens actually get mad enough and start winning.Major League has a nice collection of players playing ballplayers like veteran catcher Tom Berenger, narcissistic third baseman Corbin Bernsen, juvenile delinquent rookie pitcher Charlie Sheen known as Wild Thing for his lack of control, Wesley Snipes as center-fielder Willie Mays Hayes and Dennis Haysbert as a Santeria observing power hitter. It is the American League so Haysbert probably is the designated hitter. My favorite in the film is veteran manager James Gammon who pulls this collection together for a winning team.Major League is a film for baseball and film fans it so nicely blends the interests. As for the Cleveland Indians when Municipal Stadium closed down and they got a new ballpark in Jacobs Field, they actually won a couple of pennants in 1995 and 1997. Of course the process to build the Indians wasn't half as entertaining as Major League is.",7,15,17,13 August 2009
Annie Hall," Alvy and Annie
","Woody Allen's masterpiece with favorite co-star Diane Keaton has Allen casting himself as New York born comedian Alvy Singer and his relationship with Keaton
in the title role. Annie Hall is one of those films you can watch four or five times
and pick up a bit of humor and/or philosophy that you missed the first time.Allen is playing himself in Annie Hall, a successful comedian who spends most of
his time psychoanalyzing himself and all around him. He can't make any
relationship permanent.Along comes Keaton and it looks like this is the one, but there's always pitfalls
when you deal with a walking neurosis like Allen.Both Woody and Diane fit so naturally in their parts you think you are peeking
in on a home movie. Annie Hall won for Best Picture, Best Actress for Diane
Keaton, and Best Director and Best Original Screenplay for Woody Allen. Best
in the supporting cast is Tony Roberts as Allen's sidekick actor buddy.This really is a timeless classic. It's humor has no temporal limits. Annie Hall
can be made today with the same script and you wouldn't lose a scintilla of humor.",7,1,1,8 February 2020
2001: A Space Odyssey," The Biggest Fast Forward
","What the meaning of the black monolith is in 2001: A Space Odyssey has been puzzling moviegoers for generations. I confess I haven't any better idea than any of the others who have written on this board. I guess Stanley Kubrick and Arthur Clarke wanted everyone to make their own evaluation. A little more evidence could have helped.The awesome visual affects of 2001 for which the film won its only Oscar in 1968 have blinded a lot of viewers to the ultimate incomprehensibility of the plot. That big black rock means something a whole lot different to the prehistoric caveman than to the futuristic astronauts. To one it means power, the other understanding. It's like some all powerful creator has left this touchstone for mankind to take another leap forward.The film begins with the cave people who are struggling to survive against animal creatures who are better equipped than they are for dominance. But contact with the rock, so glaringly out of place from the surroundings awakens the latent intelligence in the cave folk and they stage a comeback against their foes. It's the beginning of man's dominance.In the biggest fast forward in screen history, we are now in the future and another of these things has been discovered on a moon of Jupiter, the first sign of intelligent life away from earth. Scientists Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood and three other scientists in cryogenic suspension are sent to investigate. Remember we haven't discovered warp drive yet. Civilization may have taken too far a leap forward because these guys are in the hands of an all powerful computer named HAL who controls the ship and their very lives by definition. What's supposed to be a tool for man now is his dominator.When man does come in contact with that monolith on a Jupiter moon, my own interpretation is that the contact represents an all powerful creator telling man to reflect on what he has achieved and to warn him to not go too fast forward in the future. The monoliths represent signposts, like checkpoints in a race to God only knows what end.I'm always leery of rating a film like 2001 too high when the plot is so vague and speculative. But the special effects and Kubrick's use of classical music to create that space ballet just so dwarf the human beings involved, in effect the film itself is a warning. And all that music was in the public domain so MGM didn't have to lay out big bucks for a composer. I always favor story over spectacle which is why I can never give 2001: A Space Odyssey the highest rating. But when the spectacle is as awesome as what Stanley Kubrick gives us, you just sit there amazed.Of course 2001 came and went and instead of reaching for the rest of the solar system and beyond, mankind regressed into barbarism with the most notable event being a planned massed murder. Mankind needs to touch the monolith and make another leap forward. Maybe Kubrick should have looked farther ahead and called his film, 2101: A Space Odyssey.I hope we touch the monolith before that.",8,8,21,6 February 2009
Blood Diamond," T.I.A.---------- This Is Africa
","One of the best films of the new century so far, Blood Diamond is both great action entertainment and a searing indictment of the exploitation of the African continent even years after the imperial European powers left their colonial possessions to fend for themselves. Africa, a continent wealthy in mineral resources with its peoples reduced to poverty at the mercy of tribal rivalries now armed with the automatic weapons of the former imperialists.By the title you guess that what people are after are diamonds which is a trade to be sure that has its international regulations. It also has people willing to skirt and ignore those regulations in pursuit of the almighty profit. The brokers be they in London, New York, or Amsterdam pay plenty of money under the table for the gems which then finance various 'revolutionary' groups who have this game going with the governments. They don't really want to take power as Leonardo DiCaprio explains to journalist Jennifer Connelly because then they'd have to govern the country. Better just to keep the revolution going, get bought off until the rulers get rich enough and just go into exile and the revolutionaries are stuck with it. No Nelson Mandelas among this crowd. And the poor as typified by fisherman Djimon Hounsou suffer.Chance and happenstance throw Hounsou in jail with Leonardo DiCaprio, a mercenary. Hounsou found and buried a large diamond the size of a bird's egg. DiCaprio learns of it when they're in jail together and the two make an alliance of convenience when there is a rebel attack and they're freed from prison. The bulk of the story concerns the two of them trying to retrieve that diamond to get out of Africa and on to a more settled life in Europe and/or America.DiCaprio and Hounsou were nominated for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor respectively. In different categories to be sure so they would not kill each other off in the voting. Sad to say neither of them won and that is a pity because I think they both deserved it.Hounsou is best known as the slave leader Cinque who overtook the crew of the Amistad in that film and he also got an Oscar nomination for that film. As for Leonardo DiCaprio, for me this is the best film he's been in so far in his career. His character is absolutely flawless.DiCaprio is from Rhodesia and lest one thing that whites did not suffer in the changing sub Saharan Africa of the last half of the last century when he tells his story to Jennifer Connelly, you will graphically realize why DiCaprio is the hard case he is. After about five or six generations of settlers there, DiCaprio felt Africa was his home as well. You will empathize with that point of view after that scene.Blood Diamond got Oscar nominations for Sound and for Film Editing. Sadly it did not win anything that year. And it is beyond belief it was not considered for Best Picture.There's enough action to satisfy those fans, but the real essence of Blood Diamond is the story it tells both of an exploited Africa and of the alliance/friendship of DiCaprio and Hounsou. Don't miss this one at all.",10,2,3,1 July 2009
The Graduate," Cougar On The Prowl
","I finally got to see The Graduate having never seen it when it came out in 1967. At the time this film purportedly spoke to the young folks of The Sixties. If in fact it, it doesn't say a whole lot for my generation.We've got a name now for what Anne Bancroft is, we call those predatory older woman looking for young sex partners cougars. She and husband Murray Hamilton haven't been having much of a sex life for many years and she's not getting any younger. The question is asked by more than a few reviewers why would she choose the sexually inexperienced Dustin Hoffman, son of a couple that she and Hamilton socialize with. To me the answer is that part of her component is control. She doesn't want some young lady killing stud around who might just abruptly leave because there are other fish in the sea. Bancroft wants to control and dominate the situation.In the meantime Hoffman is having problems with his own parents, William Daniels and Elizabeth Wilson. Daniels wants Hoffman to start job hunting and soon, we really don't know just how long Hoffman has been The Graduate so Daniels might just have a point. Wilson thinks it would really be nice if Dustin would find a nice girl and she's got the answer. She thinks that Dustin and Katharine Ross who is the daughter of Bancroft and Hamilton would make a proper wife. Here's where I have a problem with the film. Bancroft is one possessive woman and she ain't sharing Hoffman with her daughter. She's right though for the wrong reasons. Things like that tawdry affair that she and Hoffman have been having have a way of slipping out and that would just get too freakish for one family. Of course Hoffman being the dunce he is and feeling full of sexual confidence says he'll have her come what may. What may does come indeed.I don't want to reveal any more, but I think the ending that Mike Nichols has for this film is highly unrealistic, even if you just take the characters as generational symbols.The Graduate was a big hit back in the day and is considered a classic by many. It got Mike Nichols an Oscar for Best Director and nominations came for Dustin Hoffman for Best Actor, Anne Bancroft for Best Actress, Katharine Ross for Best Supporting Actress, Best Picture, and a few others. No one would argue that The Graduate isn't a well made film, I'm just not crazy about the message it sends.",6,1,3,25 April 2010
Pride & Prejudice," She speaks her mind
","Although I have a great fondness for the MGM version of Pride And Prejudice that came out in 1940 probably this English version of the pinnacle of Jane Austen's literary talents is probably closer to what she had in mind. Women have certainly come a long way since those Victorian times Ms. Austen chronicled so well.Donald Sutherland and Brenda Blethlyn play the Bennetts the proud parents of five lovely daughters that is a source of great concern. In those days with no careers open to women the idea is marry well. The parents are concerned that suitable matches are made for them. One daughter Jane looks to marry a handsome and pleasant but rather dull young man named Bingley. Looking good till Bingley's friend Darcy warns him off the husband hunting Bennett clan.This sets up the main plot of the story the growing love of Jane's sister Elizabeth played by Keira Knightley and Darcy played by Matthew MacFayden. Both read each other wrong at first. Darcy like all the others is first shocked by Elizabeth who does not conform to Victorian standards for young women, she speaks her mind. And Elizabeth misreads Darcy's character totally at first. It turns out that character is something he has a lot of.This version of Pride And Prejudice got four Oscar nominations including Keira Knightley for Best Actress. One of the other nominations was for Art&Set Design. The 1940 MGM version won the Oscar for Art&Set Design for what they created on MGM's back lot. Here the cinematography and the sets made ample use of the English countryside. See these versions back to back and see which one you think did better in the Art&Set Department.As for the story Jane Austen and her times continue to fascinate.",9,1,1,17 March 2016
Singin' in the Rain," We Lived The Research
","In the book The Films of Arthur Freed, Freed made one comment about Singin' in the Rain that always stood out in my mind. As the film was about the Hollywood era when films were learning to talk, Freed said that there was no need to do any research as he lived the research. He and any number of people who were still working at MGM a quarter of a century later.The knowledge that folks had who worked on Singin' in the Rain and the talent of Gene Kelly are the two things that make that film some consider the greatest of all musicals.Arthur Freed who wrote a lot of the song lyrics in those twenties and thirties MGM musicals together with his partner, composer Nacio Herb Brown, just reached into his own catalog for the score. The whole score is Brown-Freed except for Moses which was written by Roger Edens and Adolph Green and Betty Comden and Fit As A Fiddler with lyrics by Freed and music by Al Goodheart and Al Hoffman.The only 'original' song written for the show was Make 'Em Laugh by Brown and Freed and was Donald O'Connor's specialty. You have to put that in quotes because even the writers agreed they ripped off Cole Porter's Be A Clown. Which is from an MGM musical that Arthur Freed produced. Lucky they weren't sued.Of course the number that Singin' in the Rain is noted for is the title tune sung and danced in the splashing rain by Gene Kelly. That and the Broadway Melody ballet became two of his signature numbers. I know I don't enjoy myself as much as Mr. Kelly did in that inclement weather.Jean Hagen got a Best Supporting Actress nomination for playing that 'shimmering star in the cinema firmament' Lina Lamont. Unfortunately she lost to Gloria Grahame for The Bad and The Beautiful. One thing that the silent screen did was mask a whole lot of personalities whose voices did not fit the screen image created. That was done for great comic affect by Hagen, but Kelly in some of his love scenes was using the tragedy of John Gilbert who acted in two much the classical manner as a continental lover. Just think how history might have been different if Gilbert had the background of a song and dance man and could have transitioned to musicals. Of course Debbie Reynolds is just fine in her first real starring part as the young singing hopeful whose career is made by sound. So many in fact were, as many as those that were broken. A favorite of mine in this is Douglas Fowley the harassed director trying to get a talking performance out of the nasal Hagen and dealing with the new technology at the same time.As Freed said, no research was needed. Singin' in the Rain is a product of his life experience in those early days of sound.",10,7,11,4 February 2007
Elysium," The Ferris Wheel Paradise in Space
","Elysium has to be one of the most populist oriented science fiction films I've ever seen. Doesn't mean it isn't good, in fact has a message of equality that should resonate for today's audience.Elysium is a giant wheel in space with artificial atmosphere where folks live on the inner ring in really luxurious style. They've even got all the latest advances in modern science with a machine that can cure just about anything. For that if nothing else the people living there want to keep it to themselves.Meanwhile back on Earth the planet has just become one big polluted mass where everyone just scratches out a living the best they can. It's patrolled by robot police who keep the great mass in line. Everyone yearns to go to Elysium and live the good life. But there are no Horatio Alger stories any more. The haves, the 2% that live on Elysium want to keep it for themselves and are ruthless in keeping the other 98% in line.What's brought things to the sorry state they're in is unbridled capitalism. That's the message of Elysium.The one man who's going to change it is Matt Damon who gets an accidental overdose of radiation poisoning on his industrial job. Now he wants to get to Elysium and steal some of that rationed healthcare. In the end though he serves far more than himself.That part of the film reminded me so much of the famous noir film DOA where Edmond O'Brien is given a slow acting poison. As for the ending that's from another classic science fiction film The Omega Man with Charlton Heston. See if you don't recognize the plot elements.One of the causes near and dear to Matt Damon's heart is our environment. Both in this film and in his most recent previous film Promised Land, Damon used the power of his celebrity to voice these concerns without sacrificing an iota of entertainment.His adversary for most of the film is Jodie Foster who plays the head of Homeland Security on Elysium. She's got an agenda of her own as she protects the Homeland Security for the haves on Elysium.Elysium also makes some strong political statements about the USA as a kind of earthly Elysium which at one time was built on the strength of immigrants which now some want to keep out at any price.I did enjoy this film very much, it's one of the best so far I've seen this year.",9,14,30,13 August 2013
This Is Spinal Tap," Legends of Rock n' Roll
","As This Is Spinal Tap came out in 1984 I'd like to think that the guys are doing those nostalgia type tours along the lines of Herman's Hermits and Bobby Rydell. They're not quite at the stage of the nostalgia tours, in fact this Mockumentary makes it clear that these guys have not seen that their time has come and gone.A tiny select few musical performers cross generations with their appeal and these guys aren't it. Rob Reiner directs and plays a documentary film maker who accompanies the band Spinal Tap on its latest American tour where all kinds of things go wrong. Some familiar people make cameo appearances. I kind of like Patrick MacNee as their record label president and Bruno Kirby as a limousine driver who has a more realistic insight than the musicians.This Is Spinal Tap has a lot of devoted fans. I'm not one of them though I recognize the importance of the film as a prototype of a new genre. Mockumentaries are an acquired taste and if that's the taste you've acquired than this is your film.",6,2,4,22 September 2017
Chariots of Fire," Two Men Who Ran
","I'm not sure Chariots Of Fire deserved to be the Best Picture of 1981, I think Reds, Atlantic City, or On Golden Pond deserved that honor. But it's still quite the inspirational story of two men on the British track team of the 1924 Olympics who ran to prove something, but not the same thing.Ben Cross and Ian Charleson play Harold Abraham and Eric Liddell who are among the survivors of a lost generation to enter college, Cambridge to be precise in 1919, the year after World War I ended. It was called The Great War and the contemplation of another was too horrible to imagine. Cross as Abraham was a veteran of the war, though that fact is curiously downplayed in Chariots Of Fire.What is emphasized is his Jewish faith. Though Benjamin Disraeli had been Prime Minister and Lord Isaacs as Chief Justice and Sir Herbert Samuel never had to convert as Disraeli did for a political career, the very top of British society was still closed to Jews. I wonder if Ernest Hemingway had known the real Harold Abraham because he could have been a model for Robert Cohn in The Sun Also Rises. Abraham is not obnoxious like Cohn, but has reason for the chip on his shoulder as the Cambridge dons led by John Gielgud confront him about employing a 'professional' trainer. Gielgud could have been some mossback running the NCAA.Eric Liddell is running for his faith as well. He was not in the war, he was in China with his missionary father. Today he'd be a member of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, back in the day he typified what was then called 'muscular Christianity', the idea to show that being a Christian was not something for weaklings. Of course each in his own way makes his point, that in fact is the sum and substance of Chariots Of Fire. With Ian Charleson as Liddell, he makes an issue out of not running in an Olympic event held on the sabbath. I remember back in the day Sandy Koufax refusing to pitch in the World Series game held on Yom Kippur. Of course since the Dodgers also had Don Drysdale and Claude Osteen available at the time that was hardly a detriment. In fact the sabbath dispute over Liddell's views is solved in much the same manner.Chariots Of Fire is a nice depiction of the United Kingdom during the Twenties. It was not all the jazz age of partying, there were some very serious folk, even young folk at the time. Cross and Charleson play two such.There might be dispute over whether it was the Best Film of 1981, but the unforgettable musical score there was no doubt about. The awards that Chariots Of Fire won for Costume Design and Original Screenplay were also deserved.I think the value of Chariots Of Fire is that not only is it an inspirational film, but it takes place during an age when such things were scorned in some quarters. For that reason the film is both a good historical record and of timeless value.",8,5,5,18 July 2009
Victory," What Is The Goal?
","This was a strange project that John Huston chose late in his career for a film. Victory is a weird combination of The Longest Yard, The Great Escape and Bridge On The River Kwai when it comes to Michael Caine's concern for his man overriding all.Not that the Germans were treating the POWs like the Japanese were. The German brutality was reserved for concentration camp inmates. Still when German commandant Max Von Sydow sees a pickup soccer game, he suggests a match between the prisoners and the German Army. Of course the German Army has some really good pre-war soccer players, but among the prisoners there are some good ones as well, including one of the best ones ever in Pele. The rest of the cast also includes some first class soccer players of 1981 playing roles.Michael Caine sees a way away from labor camps and the Germans see good propaganda value in a match where the Nazis play with brutality like they do everything else. Playing the Steve McQueen role of the non-conformist is Sylvester Stallone who has escape uppermost in his mind. Still Caine and Stallone do come to an accommodation of sorts and you have to see the film to see how it all plays out.Victory is not going to rank with The Maltese Falcon or Moulin Rouge two of Huston's greatest films in my humble opinion. Still it's a nice male camaraderie film with a wartime setting though it is way too far-fetched for me.",6,0,3,13 June 2010
Selma," Where we make our stand?
","In any campaign good intelligence is always invaluable. My favorite scene in Selma is when Martin Luther King played by David Oyelowo is talking to the local activists in Selma. He tells a story of an action tried at a Georgia town where the sheriff might have been a redneck, but he was a smart redneck. He took the peaceful protesters away by stretcher without a single nightstick raised. No footage of brutality for the media to expose. So King asks the question, is Sheriff Jim Clark of Lowndes County, Alabama that much of an ignorant cracker that he won't control or want to control his deputies and 'volunteers' when push come to shove? The answer he gets is an unequivocal yes. And so it's decided that Selma is where we make our stand.I was all of 18 when the real events of Selma occurred. In the wake of the Kennedy assassination the Civil Rights Act was finally passed. Now in the wake of Lyndon Johnson's election in his own right as president part of the Selma story is how Martin Luther King and many others made sure Johnson didn't forget his commitment. Civil rights laws forbidding discrimination is one thing, but without political power because black people are ruthlessly and systematically kept from voting it means very little when no redress can be had at the polls. Tom Wilkinson plays the harassed and beleaguered LBJ who truthfully did have a lot on his plate in 1965. He was about to start a war on poverty with campaigns on many levels. He also was about to escalate a war in Vietnam and that part of the story is judiciously left out, probably rightly for the purposes of this picture and its narrative flow. But it was there nonetheless. Lest Johnson be distracted by the good and bad things he wanted to do it was up to the Civil Rights activists to keep his feet to the fire and the flames well stoked. So it was in 1965 and the events dramatized here I remember the media sending these images around the world to see. A dark side of America was exposed, an evil that had to be dealt with forthwith. What we get in Selma is both the public and private stories.David Oyelowo and Carmen Ejogo play Martin Luther and Coretta Scott King and do a good enough job that we see their private lives. Tim Roth plays Governor George Wallace and interesting seeing two British players Wilkins and Roth in the confrontation scene between the president and the governor. Dylan Baker plays the serpentine and evil J.Edgar Hoover the closest thing we've had to permanent government. He fed spicy bits to 8 presidents and no one liked that better than LBJ. It appealed to the more prurient aspects of his nature.Wallace to had his own Hoover and it was in the form of Al Lingo the head of the Alabama State Troopers. Lingo is a truly sinister figure and he's played here by Stephen Root and he has one scene with Roth as they decide what to do about the civil rights marchers. Lingo had his own intelligence service to report about Communists and his definition was those agitated for black people to not know their place. Later on he was active in Wallace's national campaigns and other ultra right wing causes.Selma got one Oscar for Best Song entitled Glory which was a blend of both gospel and rap styles. Not that I'm a big fan of the latter, still it was a deserved winner. Selma was also nominated for Best Picture. It should have won in my book.This film is about one of the defining moments in American history, one which many like myself saw unfold and one where many participants of the march from Selma to Montgomery are still with us. Their story needs to be seen by generations to come.",10,1,2,28 March 2015
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," Volturis spoiling for a fight
",The Twilight Saga came to an end with Breaking Dawn Part II as Robert Pattinson and Kristine Stewart try to settle down as best they can with the ever present threat of the Volturi clan looming over them. They've even made some kind of arrangement with Taylor Lautner and the Indian clan of werewolves to serve as protectors of their daughter.Two things about the daughter that are relevant. One the Volturis think she's a threat as the offspring of a mortal which Stewart was then and a vampire. Second thing this crowd is perpetually spoiling for a fight and the Cullen vampire clan better get some allies even if just to serve as guarantors of their good intentions that they mean no harm to anyone.Fans of the books and the previous films will not be disappointed with the film and the ending. If you want an idea of the ending if you've seen the Kirk Douglas/Johnny Cash film A Ginfight you will have some idea of how this will end albeit with a supernatural slant.,6,1,3,14 December 2012
Invictus," His Unconquerable Soul
","Invictus is one of those sports films that is more than about sports. It transcends athletics and delves deeply into world politics and human rights. Nelson Mandela who learned so many universal truths to heart in his long prison exile, learned another in that nothing on earth can unite people like sports. He may have learned that by knowing something of the life of Jackie Robinson who when he integrated American Major League Baseball found that racial differences could be bridged easier than you would imagine by fans with the common interest of seeing that Brooklyn Dodger team win.If such for a borough of the City of New York how much greater for the South African nation ruled so long by an evil doctrine of separatist White Supremacy. The black majority was now asserting itself, but Mandela did not want to preside over a nation of vengeance. The previously all white Springbok Rugby team, now integrated could unite the nation if it won the World Cup in that sport. So Mandela personally interested himself in that idea and recruited the Springbok player/coach in his crusade. Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon who played Mandela and the coach Francois Pienaar made a dream happen and had blacks and whites behind the Springboks in their quest.Two things that American audiences might have trouble grasping is that in the Mandela cabinet as in many other countries there is such a thing as a Minister of Sports. Our athletics in America are far more a private institution, that is unheard of in the USA. We might have a State Athletic Commission for boxing and other violent type sports that are mostly concerned with athletic safety. But that wasn't even always the case.And of course Rugby football is not played here. I have a young friend from South Africa who just scoffs at our National Football League and all the protective gear those guys wear. American audiences weaned on Monday Night Football seeing these Rugby players in sneakers, shorts and team jerseys playing it as rough as the NFL might get a bit of culture shock.Clint Eastwood as director had a marvelous eye for the time of history he was filming and for the culture of South Africa. But he was best at handling his actors as Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon received Best Actor and Supporting Actor nominations for their roles. If there is a fault with Invictus it is that these two so dominate the film that no other characters really develop. But these are two who can hold an audience's attention.For a really compelling film about one of the great men of the last and current century and the time he lived in, you must absolutely see and be informed and educated by Invictus.",9,1,2,1 April 2011
La La Land," Short of greatness
","Tis said that a really great picture is one where even the small character parts truly stand out. Gone With The Wind boasts not just its four memorable leads, but a whole flock of memorable characters who stand out. Dr. Meade by Harry Davenport and his wife Julia Meade by Jane Darwell are two examples and there are many more.La La Land stands short of real greatness in that it only concentrates on its two leads with the rest of the characters well into the background. But the two leads Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone being nominated for Best Actor and Actress and Stone taking home the Oscar gold.La La Land is a salute to those old time backstage musicals in an age when movies just don't have the talented musical performers to do those films any more. Emma Stone had some nice notes, but Gosling did his singing in the tradition of Rex Harrison who as I recall won Oscar and Tony for being Henry Higgins with talk/sing role.Gosling is a musician, a jazz pianist in the tradition of Earl Hines and Count Basie and he wants to bring back jazz. He truly hates contemporary music and the fact he has to play keyboard in a rock band rather than do what those aforementioned gentlemen did. I really identified with Gosling, in my own life I'm posting music with Bing and Frank and their contemporaries on Facebook and care not if no one else listens but me.Stone just wants the world to notice her talent and in that cruel and heartless world that can be show business getting noticed about 3/4 of the battle. She does do a reckless move that would and could dishearten anyone so the world will notice what she has to offer.Besides Stone winning Best Actress and young Damian Chazelle for Best Director, La La Land won 6 others and several more nominations like Gosling's. The music is fine though I wish we had people like Frank Sinatra or a Gene Kelly to perform this stuff now.La La Land is a wonderful film that falls a tad short on greatness.",7,2,6,9 May 2017
Super 8," Another Alien Just wants to go home
","I'm not sure why Super 8 could not have been set during the present rather than in 1979 which is so identified because at the beginning there is mention of the famous 3 Mile Island nuclear disaster over the radio of the protagonist family. I do believe it may be set there because this is the era that producer Steven Spielberg knew first hand as a young man and the one he personally identifies with.The movie is a combination of both E.T. and Stand By Me. But instead of cute and lovable E.T. just trying to get home, instead we've got a really nasty alien monster with an attitude wanting same. However this alien has a real good reason for his bad attitude. He was captured by our government and tortured by an elite unit.Some kids who are trying to make a film for some contest happen to capture a train wreck on camera where our monster has escaped. Right after that, strange events start happening in the town and the army comes in. The military is not real forthcoming with answers about what's happening. A little bit of national security and a whole lot of guilt.But the kids led by Joel Courtney Miller and Elle Fanning do start figuring this whole thing out until the alien captures Fanning along with other assorted townfolk who've gone missing. Then young Miller gets a boys adventure of a lifetime when he goes to rescue Fanning and has to make contact with the alien to do so. That's when Super 8 becomes vintage Spielberg.One other performance I should single out is that of Glynn Turman who is the doctor who was involved with the alien and took his point of view and is against what our government was doing. Turman reminded me a bit of Danny Glover, but he gave a restrained and intelligent performance in a difficult role. He has to and does convince the audience that their sympathy must lay with the being from outer space.Super 8 should be seen in an Imax theater as I did. The special effects are great. But the kids are a really winning bunch of real and not movie star kids. They and Glynn Turman make Super 8 one of the better films of this year so far.",8,3,7,21 June 2011
The Last Samurai," The Saga of Saigo Takamori
","Although the central character is American mercenary Tom Cruise, the story of The Last Samurai is about the little known to occidentals event of the Samurai revolt of 1877 led by Saigo Takamori who operates under a different character name and is played flawlessly by Ken Watanabe. Changing his name much like the way Clarence Darrow and William Jennings Bryan were under different names in Inherit the Wind allowed for some dramatic and historic license.Japan was undergoing a tremendous transformation at this point in time. The United States had with Commodore Matthew Perry's voyage in 1853 opened Japan and cracked her isolationist policy. Over 200 years before the Japanese government had instigated a policy of isolationism in regard to the countries of Europe. It seems as though they looked askance at the Christian missionaries and their activities. They put an almost total embargo on trade or contact of any kind with the west.The Dutch who had very specifically not sent any missionaries to Japan were allowed some extremely limited trading rights in the city of Shiminoseki during this period. So in a limited sense the Japanese kept up with western technological developments. Firearms in fact unlike in the film were in some use in Japan even at the time of Perry's voyage. The Samurai did make some use of them.Cruise is an American Civil War and Indian War hero who's making a living shilling for the Winchester Rifle company. He gets an offer to go to Japan to train a modern army for a whole lot of money and he accepts. In between Perry's voyage and the events of this film, a new Emperor came on the throne. The Emperor Meiji was anxious indeed that his country catch up with the rest of the world and not become a colony of some modern technologically advanced western country. He also did not want to lose sight of old traditions. Duelling advisers competed for his heart and mind in the film and in real life.Cruise's trained troops the first time they're in battle with the professional samurai turn and run. He's taken prisoner, but while in captivity grows to respect and admire Watanabe and what he represents. He also falls in love with a Japanese woman and I have to say his romance made a whole lot more sense than the one John Wayne had in The Barbarian and the Geisha.The final battle scene is impressive, the samurai's own Alamo to put it in American terms. In defeat Saigo Takamori though a rebel became a folk hero in Japan. The Last Samurai is a great story and Americans should see this story about a Japan they only know from World War II films, both good and bad. Tom Cruise should be given a lot of credit for using his star power to bring this story to American audiences.",9,16,36,19 February 2006
The Hurricane," Rubin Carter 1937-2014
","15 years after The Hurricane came out Rubin Carter passed away still quite the
symbol of what can happen when a malignant criminal justice system puts a 
target on your back and is determined to nail you. The Hurricane became his
nickname in the boxing arena given him for the speed and accuracy of the deadly
attack in the ring. He was forever Rubin Hurricane Carter even after he fought
his last fight.After his boxing career had wound down he and a friend were picked up in his
home town of Patterson, New Jersey because they vaguely resembled two men who had shot up and robbed a bar and killed 3 people. On some flimsy
evidence and some evidence withheld Carter and the other man went to jail
and probably escaped the death penalty because it wasn't being used at the
time.Besides the background events The Hurricane mostly focuses on the events 
of Carter trying to clear himself and the young kid who reads the book Carter
wrote while he was in prison. The best scenes in the film are Vicellous Shannon as young Lezra and Denzel Washington as Carter.The Hurricane brought Denzel Washington one of his Oscar nominations and
he will keep you riveted on the screen with his intensity. Occasionally Washington boils over, but it's the slow simmering tension he conveys as Carter
that really keeps you watching. His scenes with Shannon are a great relief for
him as in this kid he meets someone who believes his story and gets what he's
about.Besides Washington and Shannon, performances to watch out for are Rod
Steiger as Judge Sarokin who is the federal judge who decides Carter's fate and
Dan Hedaya as the incredibly vicious and racist police lieutenant who made
incarcerating Carter a life's obsession.The real Rubin Carter could not have had his story better told than be Denzel
Washington in The Hurricane.",8,0,2,28 July 2018
Where Eagles Dare," Agents, Double Agents, Triple Agents
","The only problem that Where Eages Dare suffers from is that it came out too soon after The Dirty Dozen and suffers from comparison. That is a pity because in some ways it's even better than the Dirty Dozen.This was Alastair McLean's only original screenplay and he did a fine job. As a writer of some really great films and novels his stories are a great exercise for the grey cells. He combines action in this as well and Where Eagles Dare has enough action to satisfy an Indiana Jones lover.British Intelligence has given one of its best operatives, Richard Burton, a difficult assignment. An American general's plane has crashed and he's been taken prisoner by the Germans. He's being held in a remote Bavarian castle where only eagles would try a rescue.Burton has been given a team of his own countrymen, plus the addition of an American, Clint Eastwood. Nobody's quite sure why he's there, but as we get into the film it becomes clear that the mission Burton is on is far more complex than a rescue. The best scene in Where Eagles Dare is with Burton and Eastwood finally in the castle and Burton playing a cat and mouse game with the Nazis to elicit information. It's a brilliantly staged scene and Burton pulls it off with aplomb.Of course the action comes as Burton and Eastwood and company try to leave the castle. As I said enough heroics there that would put any of the Indiana Jones films to shame.Where Eagles Dare is almost three hours in length. But it holds your interest through out. Action films don't get better than this.",10,10,16,21 May 2006
National Treasure," The Loot Of Our Founding Fathers
","National Treasure is one fanciful tale of Sean Bean and Nicholas Cage each seeking what is the treasure of the Knights Templar which got handed down to our Founding Fathers and hidden away for over 200 years. Of course Bean is quite a bit less scrupulous than Cage, but guess who triumphs in the end?Our story takes us from the Arctic, to the Smithsonian in Washington, to the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia and finally to New York City near the site of George Washington's Inaugural. Once the action gets going it doesn't pause for too many minutes. National Treasure borrows a great deal in plot and pace from the Indiana Jones films.Of course this plot has enough bullet holes in it that one with a reasonable knowledge of American history can find, but it's still a rather enjoyable film. Harvey Keitel is fine as the FBI agent pursuing Cage who's looking for the treasure and pursuing and avoiding Bean at the same time. Why is the FBI after Cage? Well he stole something rather irreplaceable.Of course the part that I find a bit preposterous is the fact of where the location was. I can't believe that with the amount of excavation for construction done around there, the treasure wasn't located a hundred years ago.Best in the film is Justin Bartha as Cage's sidekick. He has a really great deadpan delivery of the best lines in the film.",7,2,5,24 July 2007
The Wind that Shakes the Barley," Knowing What's Right
","The Wind That Shakes the Barley seems like an answer to Liam Neeson's acclaimed biographical film Collins. And curiously enough the answer is given by another Irish actor who states Neeson is a mentor of sorts to him.Cillian Murphy is the star of this film and he's an Irish Republican Army member, recruited in much the same fashion that Don Murray was in Shake Hands With the Devil, an incident with the British auxiliary Black and Tans radicalizes him and turns him into a patriot. Murphy joins the brigade with good friend Padriac Delaney and the two become comrades in arms.Comes the signing of the treaty that is so well portrayed in Collins and we see the different attitudes of both men. Delaney is for and Murphy against the treaty. Each brings powerful arguments to bear on his side and each is completely convinced of the rightness of his position. The split between treaty and non-treaty advocates defined Irish politics for the next couple of generations, their political parties were formed on that issue. It's a lot like the split between Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton defined our political parties although in Ireland it was a lot more bloody. Not shown in The Wind That Shakes the Barley is the half a dozen years of civil war in the twenties that was more bloody and costly than the original war growing out of the election of Sinn Fein advocates to the British Parliament and those members forming the initial Irish Parliament.Murphy and Delaney head a very capable cast of Irish players telling a story of a terrible part of their history. I'd recommend seeing this film to anyone who wants to know about Ireland of the last century.",9,3,9,5 May 2007
Rocky," The Cinderella Film
","Sylvester Stallone had a dream and it was to get this film made about an enduring character he created, one of the most enduring in the history of cinema. In true Cinderella Man style Rocky guaranteed him a career and screen immortality. A whole lot like the protagonist ROcky Balboa in the film.There was an Irish equivalent of Rocky during the early Sixties in real life, a boxer named Tom McNeeley from South Boston, just as Rocky Balboa is from South Philadelphia. McNeeley was a barely ranked contender, ranked in fact at all just to give him some kind of credence as an opponent for Floyd Patterson. McNeeley fought Patterson in Boston for the local gate attraction. Needless to say his showing against Floyd wasn't quite as good as what Rocky did against Carl Weathers as Apollo Creed, showboating heavyweight champion in the style of Muhammed Ali.And that's what happens to Rocky. Stallone is a local club fighter who also works as a part time enforcer for the loan sharks, but his heart isn't really into it. His heart is torn actually between boxing and his love for Talia Shire, the plain Jane sister of his friend Burt Young.When opportunity comes you have to take it. For some reason a scheduled match between Weathers and another contender for the championship falls through. Several other name contenders aren't available, so it comes down to Rocky Balboa being given a once in lifetime chance in a bout to be held in his native Philadelphia like McNeeley's was in real life.Rocky was the Cinderella story of the Oscars that year, it won for Best Picture, Best Director for John G. Avildsen, and Best Film Editing. Sly Stallone was nominated for Best Actor and Original Screenplay. He lost however to Peter Finch for Network. Burgess Meredith as Rocky's cornerman and gym owner and Carl Weathers were nominated for Best Supporting Actor, but both lost to Jason Robards, Jr. for All the President's Men. My favorite in the film was Talia Shire, she is really touching as the Thirty something unmarried plain girl who grabs a last chance for love with Rocky. The role is so different from Connie Corleone in any of the three Godfather films. Sadly Talia lost to Beatrice Straight as William Holden's wife in Network.John Avildsen winning for Best Director is great though I think the film is so much Stallone's own creation, he should have won for Original Screenplay. Avildsen never directed anything as good as Rocky before or since. In fact he directed seven years later one of my all time favorite trash films, A Night In Heaven.Rocky is the great Cinderella movie of all time, the creation of its leading character who put enough of his heart into this film and gained a career for himself. None of the succeeding Rocky films came anywhere near this one for quality. And the story itself was pure Cinderella. How paradoxical and how great.",9,2,4,15 May 2009
Pretty Woman," Cinderella Working The Streets
","Julia Roberts got her first Best Actress nomination for Pretty Woman where she plays a working girl who has a chance meeting with an Eighties economic entrepreneur played elegantly by Richard Gere. When you think about the film, it's an absolutely unreal fantasy, but carried off brilliantly by the charm of its leads.It's one of those chance meetings as Roberts is looking to pay her's and roommate Laura San Giacomo's rent. Gere gets himself lost in Hollywood on the way to Beverly Hills and stops and asks Roberts for directions. Those kind of instructions she doesn't normally give, but incredibly enough they hit it off and Gere brings her back to his penthouse suite at the Regent Beverly Hotel. I'm not sure there is such a place in real life. Turns out he needs her for a business date as he's negotiating with Ralph Bellamy and Alex Hyde-White for their company. Gere essentially does what Danny DeVito does in Other People's Money, but with a little more class. But with lube or not, Bellamy and Hyde-White aren't taking this one without a fight.Julia's character is part Pygmalion, part Cinderella and who would think she would find as a fairy godfather Hector Elizondo, manager of the Regent Beverly. Normally his job would be to throw working girls out of the place, but Elizondo is charmed by her as everyone else.Pretty Woman marked the farewell appearance of Ralph Bellamy who made his film debut in 1931. Unlike so many of his contemporaries, Bellamy kept going right up to the end when a lot of them were forcibly retired due to the collapse of the studio system. Bellamy to his credit also never did garbage strictly for a paycheck as some others did.One other interesting character of note is Jason Alexander known to most as George Costanza of Seinfeld. Costanza's a pretty smarmy character in his own right, but Alexander who plays Gere's lawyer makes Costanza look like an Eagle Scout.In Pretty Woman, both Roberts and Gere learn some valuable life lessons from each other. And the audience will learn a couple also if they get to view Pretty Woman.",8,4,8,4 August 2008
Some Like It Hot," 'I Want to be A Bull Again'
","Billy Wilder being as daring as he could with Code still firmly in place decides to stretch all the gender boundaries he could with this comedy in drag. The results some say resulted in the funniest film ever made.Some Like It Hot concerns a couple of jazz age musicians in 1929 witnessing the murder of informant George E. Stone. Of course the head doer George Raft spots our intrepid duo and Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon are forced to flee Chicago.The getaway plan. Take a gig with an all woman orchestra going south to Florida. The orchestra has Marilyn Monroe as a singer so the trip will have its pleasant diversity.After the trouble Wilder had with Monroe on The Seven Year Itch he swore he wouldn't do another film with her. But United Artists wanted a big name for box office guarantee before he could get the financing and Curtis and Lemmon weren't big enough. So Monroe was signed and by all accounts the picture was another trial to make for all concerned.Tony Curtis's feelings were well known about Monroe, he didn't like her. Yet his scenes with her were very funny indeed both with him in drag and doing a spoof of his idol, Cary Grant. Jack Lemmon was far more philosophical. I saw him in an interview once simply say that Marilyn was a girl with a whole lot of problems and unrealized talent when she died. That's what you would expect from Lemmon, one of the nicest people ever in the film industry.Jack Lemmon also got an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. But Some Like It Hot ran into the year of Ben-Hur sweeping all the Oscars that year. It wasn't even nominated for Best Picture. Billy Wilder lost for Best Director. The only Oscar it did win was for Orry-Kelly for costume design for those recreations from the Twenties and the special costumes that Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis wore.Billy Wilder sprinkled his cast with a lot of people identified with the gangster genre. Who more than George Raft who really lived the part in real life. And others like George E. Stone, Mike Mazurki, and Nehemiah Persoff. Pat O'Brien plays the federal man on the trail of the mobsters and in his memoirs O'Brien thanked Billy Wilder profusely for giving him a part in a classic film when his career hit the skids in the Fifties.Of course the real daring here was Joe E. Brown as the dissolute playboy and his infatuation with Jack Lemmon in drag. Today Brown's character would be really a gay guy who's into drag queens and Lemmon after some initial misgivings might just decide that gay for pay pays a lot better than playing the bull fiddle. But the Code while not broken was stretched a might in Some Like It Hot.A film that didn't get into the top five in 1959 is now considered the funniest comedy of all time. You won't get any argument from me over that one.",10,8,15,10 August 2006
Hoosiers," Basketball, the Indiana state religion
","I guess because on either side of Indiana, both Ohio and Illinois have two major league baseball team franchises, the state of Indiana has rebelled and adopted basketball as the official state sport. Some could compare Indiana's basketball mania to many southern states and their local devotion to college and high school football. It's more like a secular religion down there.In the early Fifties Gene Hackman has been hired by a local high school to coach its floundering basketball team which is built around one star player, Maris Valainis. Maris's father was the assistant coach and is also the town drunk and is played by Dennis Hopper. He's as jealous as Lloyd Bridges was when Gary Cooper didn't recommend he move up to the job of marshal in High Noon.Barbara Hershey plays a teacher who is worried about Valainis getting a good education and who actually now has custody of the kid because Hopper's been ruled an unfit dad won't let him play. That's the specific problem that Hackman is facing.The general problem is that especially in a small town setting everyone and his brother think they can do a better job than the current athletic coach of whatever sport. Just listen to any sports phone-in show on the radio and you'll have that fact confirmed. Still that's just what comes with the territory. The best character in Hoosiers is without a doubt Hopper. He was a star basketball player in the town and he can't get over the fact that those years in high school were the high point of his life. He never went on to anything else and that's what Hershey is trying to prevent happening with his son. Ironically this same situation is humorously exploited in Married With Children where Al Bundy waxes nostalgically about his high school football days, remember four touchdowns in a single game.In fact Dennis Hopper got an Oscar nomination in the Best Supporting Actor category, one of two that Hoosiers got the other being for best musical scoring. I think Hoosiers misses being a classic though a lot will disagree with me. The characters except for Hopper are not really developed by the script. Other than Valainis the kids on the team have no real individual identities, we never learn just Hackman did that brought him out of college ranks and in the Navy for eleven years between his last college job and this one.The basketball scenes move at a good pace though and Hoosiers is after all about basketball. And nothing but basketball.",7,0,1,31 January 2010
Jack Reacher," A Grassy Knoll Scenario
","Tom Cruise stars in Jack Reacher who is like a modern day Simon Templar without the elegance. We're not sure just what side of the law our protagonist is on, he certainly dislikes being called a hero.It is understandable that the debut of this film was postponed with the tragedy of the Sandy Hook school shooting as the film opens with just such a shooting from one side of the Allegany River to another in Pittsburgh. A loner ex-GI with a penchant for violence who trained as a sniper who it is broadly hinted has done similarly evil stuff in the past gets accused of a mass shooting where six people die. There was a really good Law And Order episode where Sebastian Stan plays a high school kid who shot four people at random to cover up his intended target. That's what's going on here. And as investigator Reacher sees, there's a grassy knoll scenario being played here.Cruise whose latest films have a decidedly more violent bent to them, seems determined to finally shake off that youthful image that has stood him in good stead with films going way back to All The Right Moves. He doesn't look like the all American kid in his Twenties, but as the male player with the surest box office draw he can't exactly transition to character roles the way others can. One guy who successfully has is Robert Duvall who has a colorful and eye catching role as the owner of a rifle range whose client√®le has the key to this mystery. Duvall and Cruise are reunited from Days Of Thunder as Duvall serves as backup. Guys like the folks in back of the massacre are giving gun owners and shooters a bad name which is why he teams with Cruise. That is a message I'm not sure how it will be received in this climate.Rosamund Pike plays the attorney with father issues personal and legal who is representing the accused shooter. When your father is played by Richard Jenkins who is also the District Attorney those issues do tend to multiply. She's afraid of Reacher's own violent tendencies, but goes with the flow.You can't tell about these things and certainly the Sandy Hook shooting throws a pall on this film. Still there's enough shooting, enough car chases to satisfy any action fan. And Tom Cruise's global legion of fans will have little to complain about.",6,2,10,27 December 2012
"McFarland, USA"," Once he learns the culture
","You would not think it at first glance but McFarland, USA turns out to be the site of an inspiring motion picture as well as the title for same. It's the story of a down and out high school coach played by Kevin Costner who in a last chance job takes one at a high school in the small town of McFarland, California having one of the poorest per capita incomes in the USA and made up of a mostly Chicano population who work mostly as fruit pickers. One of the first sites he sees at his new job as a Physical Education Teacher is mom picking up her three sons for their jobs as pickers after school. But those three brothers turn out to be an integral part of the cross country running team that he creates for the school. These kids see no future other than the fields of citrus fruit to pick and really have no confidence in themselves. Once he learns the culture Costner is able to motivate those kids to achieve not only in track, but in life.Costner and wife Maria Bello mix so well with them that they even have a Quincinera for their 15 year old daughter Morgan Saylor, a custom in Hispanic families kind of a coming out for a 15 year old daughter. The Quincinera also leads to a crisis of sorts, but it reaffirms the faith and trust that the kids and parents have developed in Costner.McFarland,USA is a fine family film from the Disney Studios and recommended most definitely for juvenile audiences.",7,3,4,23 November 2015
Les Mis√©rables," 'The People Shall Be Free'
","I've said many times to friends when I hear about certain projects like adapting Les Miserables as a musical I'm usually skeptical. Then as often as not I'm proved wrong and I'm happy to say I was proved wrong here. Les Miserables is far more than a musical, it has the same epic quality that dramatic film versions I've seen, most particularly the 1935 film with Fredric March and Charles Laughton. As for the musical score the only show I can compare with this is Porgy And Bess, a much simpler story on not so broad a canvass, but still with an epic quality. Both Les Miserables and Porgy And Bess slip ever so surreptitiously into a category of music some might call opera. In another century Les Miserables might very well be labeled an opera.And it's interesting in that the leads are done and well by a pair of non-singers Hugh Jackman as Jean Valjean and his tormentor Inspector Javert played by Russell Crowe. Neither are exactly trained voices, but they get the musical score delivered. Hugh Jackman got an Oscar nomination for Best Actor, the film for Best Picture and a flock of other nominations for technical categories.And it brought a Best Supporting Actress Award to Anne Hathaway as the tragic Fantine. I always thought Anne was overlooked when she played Jake Gyllenhaal's wife in Brokeback Mountain, that she should have been nominated that year. Nice to see the Academy made it up to her this year. The success of Les Miserables on Broadway and in film once again shows that there is indeed a market for the classics when they're intelligently made. Besides Anne Hathaway, Les Miserables took home Oscars for Sound and for Makeup. It seems to have an appeal for folks in my age bracket who went to school in the Sixties. The revolutionary ardor of the students fomenting rebellion in the years of Orleanist France seems to strike a familiar note with those who marched in protests. Even so with young people today who like to identify with the young of that era in France lost in a cause much bigger than their own individual lives are.And I think it will be so in the future.",9,7,12,6 May 2013
The Da Vinci Code," Rocking Christianity to the Core
","So what's all the fuss about? Tom Hanks is a visiting American professor of Theology in Paris and Audrey Tautou is a cryptologist with the French police. Hanks is accused of murdering Tautou's grandfather and she believes him when he says he's innocent. The investigating detective, Jean Reno, has another agenda going as he's a member of Opus Dei. The DaVinci Code is a murder mystery chase very much in the style of such Hitchcock thrillers as North By Northwest and The 39 Steps. It's not as good as those two, but not bad either. Ron Howard has made an entertaining enough film and should put a lot of money in his pocket with all the protests going on. As is usually the case, they're driving up the box office. You can't buy the kind of publicity that fundamentalist Christians are giving this film.So what's the protest for? We've got a couple of secret religious societies protecting their secrets and killing a lot of people to do it. One of the secrets is that Jesus was in fact a very human soul who did human things such as get married to Mary Magdalene and have a daughter. Supposedly she went to France with her child and is in fact buried in France. And there are descendants walking around today.The novel by Dan Brown certainly was well received and sold millions of copies. But folks it is when all is said and done, a NOVEL. It's a work of fiction from an imaginative author, nothing more. In fact at the very beginning of the opening credits it says that the movie is taken from the NOVEL by Dan Brown. Ron Howard will need several Brink's Armored cars to haul away all the profits he will make with The DaVinci Code. Ironically the same people who are beating him up over this film were praising him last year over Cinderella Man. That was a good family values film and it was, I liked it a lot. I liked this one too.By the way special mention should go to Audrey Tautou. She conveys an Audrey Hepburn like quality in her role and hopefully this will be a break out film for her.",7,7,17,21 May 2006
Titanic," Maytime On The High Seas
","Who says that old fashioned romantic films don't sell. They certainly do if they're done right as the story in Titanic certainly is.This blockbuster version of the most famous shipwreck in history is a homage to Maytime. In fact in casting Gloria Stuart as old Rose through whose eyes we see the disaster unfold, Director James Cameron went back to a contemporary of Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy.The film begins with the discovery of the wreck of the Titanic in the middle Eighties which did cause great excitement at the time. Searching the wreck divers come upon a safe and a nude portrait of a woman wearing a necklace with a diamond thought to be lost and the portrait is dated April 14, 1912. The woman is still alive and its Gloria Stuart who tells her tale the way an aged Jeanette MacDonald did in Maytime.Winning a card game that got him a third class passage aboard the maiden voyage of Titanic, itinerant artist Leonardo DiCaprio gets on board the vessel. He meets and woos a younger version of Gloria Stuart who is played by Kate Winslet. Unfortunately she's about to enter a loveless marriage for money urged on by her mother, Frances Fisher, who wants her declining years not be spent in the poorhouse. Her prospective fianc√© is Billy Zane a rather arrogant young robber baron heir of his time who has a factotum/bodyguard in David Warner who has one of the best roles in the film. Still Leo and Kate get a few stolen hours of romance before the disaster strikes.One thing that James Cameron did is that he never allowed the spectacle of the disaster nor even the issues of wealth and class that were omnipresent in the Titanic story to overwhelm his romantic leads. In fact they are an integral part of the story as young Leo reaches for what was unobtainable.Leonardo DiCaprio remarked that his part of Jack was the least complex role he ever did. The part is a romantic lead, the guy has no secrets or hidden issues, he's just a young man in love. Maybe that was the reason he was not nominated for Best Actor in the face of all those nominations Titanic did get. It won for Best Picture and Best Director and a flock of Oscars in the technical area. Kate Winslet and Gloria Stuart were nominated and lost for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress respectively.Titanic is a story that's been filmed since the silent days almost in the wake of the disaster itself. The Germans made a propaganda film of it in 1943 which Nazi inspired though it was, did make a few points against the British upper classes and that the first class got saved and those in steerage mostly drowned. There was a fine version in 1953 with Clifton Webb and Barbara Stanwyck as an older married couple with problems on the doomed ship. And the British did the classic, A Night to Remember which is a documentary like recreation from the ship's officers point of view.Still they'll have to go some beat this one. Titanic is a film for lovers of all ages and run Maytime back to back with Titanic if you can get DVDs and/or VHSs of both films.",10,8,17,2 September 2007
Thor," Me Thor, You Jane
","The Marvel Comic hero Thor of course based on the ancient Norse God of Thunder comes to the big screen in a fine version with very nice computer graphic special effects. And it has the added attraction of a classical actor like Kenneth Branagh directing and having the lines of the Norse immortals spoken as if the Bard had written them. As played by Chris Hemsworth, Thor's been exiled to Earth, the last time he visited there was when the ancient Norse were worshiping him and other such beings who visited from Asgaard. Thor's a warrior, but it takes more than being mighty in battle to rule as his father Odin keeps patiently trying to tell him.Anthony Hopkins another actor with classical acting chops plays Odin and I wonder if Hopkins might have envied Laurence Olivier for getting the plum role of Zeus in a film. He's now equaled him in playing another immortal deity.Thor lands on Earth, New Mexico to be specific and runs into scientific researcher Jane and she tickles his fancy the same way that other Jane rang Tarzan's bell. Natalie Portman is the object of Hemsworth's affections. But back on Asgaard Thor's brother Loki as played by Tom Higglesworth is plotting a palace coup of his own. That leads to a really spectacular fight to the finish as Thor's mighty hammer gives a few folks an attitude adjustment.Branagh served up a fine tasty dish for those who like their comic book heroes. Hopefully we'll see these folks again in some further adventures.",7,16,32,27 May 2011
The Happening," Overblown Outer Limits
","Watching The Happening on the big screen tonight I had a feeling I was back in the Sixties looking at a souped up version of an Outer Limits episode that was given several million dollars to shoot. In fact maybe I ought to check their episode list.The strangest terrorist attack on record takes place, starting in New York City's Central Park. People just go into slow motion, stop, become completely disoriented and then start killing themselves with the closest means at hand. One woman stabs herself in the neck with a spike, construction workers just start jumping off the buildings they work on, a policeman in Philadelphia takes out his service weapon and shoots himself and then others follow picking up his weapon to use.All this is frightening stuff and when it starts spreading across the Middle Atlantic states, Philadelphia science teacher Mark Wahlberg picks up his wife Zooey Deschanel and leaves. Along the way they inherit young Ashlyn Sanchez from Wahlberg's colleague John Leguizamo.M. Night Shaymalan usually does films with some spiritual meaning so I was surprised when he offered a scientific if far fetched explanation for what was happening. The plants on our planet have sped up the evolutionary process and now are emitting a disorienting gaseous toxin in the air. If that's the case the thing to do is head for the concrete however the Amtrak train taking Wahlberg and company away from Philadelphia let's them off in the woods between Philly and Harrisburg. I'm still trying to figure out why they didn't run into any Amish.Science isn't Shaymalan's bag however and it shows. I don't think the concepts here were thought out at all. The ending you will find to be something of a surprise.Best in the cast is Betty Buckley a strange hermit like woman who lives in the woods and offers some shelter for our travelers. But she's one strange bird as you'll discover.The Happening was a major disappointment for me, I was expecting so much more and definitely something different.",4,10,18,8 July 2008
The Untouchables," 'If Capone Puts One Of Your's In The Hospital, You Put One Of His In The Morgue'
","Not that I'm complaining mind you because The Untouchables is a quality motion picture that got Sean Connery an Oscar for a lifetime of work, but one fine day we just might get the real story of Eliot Ness and his Untouchable squad of Treasury agents. For those who are fans of Brian DePalma's film it's no more accurate than the famous Untouchable series in the Fifties or its counterpart in the Nineties.The plain truth is that Eliot Ness's operations against Al Capone's liquor supply did hurt him economically somewhat, but hardly slowed down his operation in Chicago. As for the income tax conviction that eventually did land Capone in Alcatraz, it was accomplished by the hard working accountants in US Attorney George W. Johnson's office. In the film that is the Clifton James character and Ness and his squad did work for him, but Charles Martin Smith's character would not have been an Untouchable.Whatever else Ness was, he was a master of generating good publicity for his work, the same way J. Edgar Hoover was, or Thomas E. Dewey, right down to Rudolph Giuliani in our time. That is in fact, part of a good crime fighter's job, the more people know of your successful good work, the more cooperation you get from the public. When Ness who went on to become the Chief of Police in Cleveland and then unsuccessful Republican candidate for Mayor of same, his career and finances took a nose dive. Just before he died he worked with writer Oscar Fraley on a memoir of his work and this became the cornerstone of The Untouchables franchise. Very much like what Wyatt Earp did just before he died, giving interviews for an authorized biography by Stuart Lake which became the basis for all the Wyatt Earp films done since the Thirties.Unlike the original TV series The Untouchables, Eliot Ness's Scandinavian background as versus the Italian Al Capone is made much of in this film. Kevin Costner is your basic good guy and Robert DeNiro joins a great list of actors like Rod Steiger, Neville Brand, and Jason Robards, Jr. in interpreting the volatile crime boss of Chicago who has come down in legend himself.Costner's a Boy Scout in this business and as Sean Connery says to him, those kind of rules are out the window in dealing with people like Al Capone. His bit of philosophy given to Costner when Costner recruits him for The Untouchables is the title of the review. Connery plays an honest patrolman of Irish descent who hates dishonesty, but also don't think a little prejudice against the Italian Capone isn't involved in his thinking as well. Jimmy Malone is a broad and expansive part that Sean Connery can work wonders with.To be honest I don't think The Untouchables is Connery's best work, one friend has told me The Name of The Rose is his favorite, another has said Woman Of Straw is his favorite. My personal favorite among Sean Connery's performances is the incredibly neglected The Molly Maguires. But like John Wayne's True Grit, Sean Connery's Oscar is for the work of a lifetime for a man who may be the most well known international film star we've ever had.Now Billy Drago's Frank Nitti is a performance that will leave you chilled for days and susceptible to pneumonia. That it's far from the real Frank Nitti and that Nitti did not end the way Drago does in the film is irrelevant. But that's just another inaccuracy of the film.Brian DePalma wasn't trying for accuracy, he was trying to make an entertaining film. In that he succeeded.",7,4,6,22 January 2009
The Godfather: Part III," Mother Of Mercy, Is This The End Of The Corleones?
","The Godfather Trilogy may have reached its end with The Godfather: Part III. But was there enough room to allow for yet another film based on another generation of the Corleones? Time and public demand will only tell.I liked The Godfather: Part III right up to and including Sofia Coppola's much maligned performance as Mary Corleone daughter of Don Michael Corleone, the one and only Al Pacino. I think she was unjustly criticized. In her performance she set out to play one of the innocent children of Al Pacino. There's a moving scene in The Godfather where we saw Al Pacino and Marlon Brando talking for the last time. Brando's hopes were for his son to become Governor Corleone, Senator Corleone to attain that level of respectability that was out of the Don's reach. Pacino tells him, maybe the next generation.Flash forward to the late seventies where Pacino has slowly divested himself of the illegal interests of the Corleone family. But the other crime bosses don't like the idea of him going completely legitimate. He also has some opposition within his own family. His surviving sibling Talia Shire thinks he ought to keep a hand in and his illegitimate nephew, Andy Garcia is having a running feud with another family head, Joe Mantegna.Andy Garcia got the only acting nomination for The Godfather: Part III as Sonny's son out of wedlock. And he's every bit as wild and hot tempered as Sonny was from The Godfather. Garcia brings a lot of passion to the part. But he does prove able to learn from his uncle and eventually not repeat the mistakes of his father. Garcia lost to another hoodlum portrayal, Joe Pesci for Goodfellas for Best Suppporting Actor.Probably Al Pacino has gotten all he could out of the character of Michael Corleone. He's gotten real respectability now, he's been conferred with a Papal Knightship for the good works of the Corleone Foundation now. He's high up the criminal world too. But people and circumstances won't let those worlds mix and as he ruefully remarks, 'just when I think I'm out, they drag me back in again.'Only four characters made it through the three Godfather films, Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, and Richard Bright as Al Neri. All except Neri seem to grow in character, Neri is still button man in chief since Lucabrazzi started sleeping with the fishes in The Godfather. Keaton's character is still the outsider. Separated from Pacino in The Godfather: Part II, she still loves him and regrets as much as he has the outside forces that caused their separation.Although Talia Shire got an Oscar Nomination for Best Supporting Actress in The Godfather: Part II, I think she really comes into her own in this one. Had it not been for male chauvinism implicit in the Sicilian culture, she'd be taking over the family business from Pacino. She's changed so dramatically over the course of the three films. In The Godfather she's the innocent daughter about to embark on marriage to a wife beater. In The Godfather: Part II, she's now entering middle age, overindulging in excesses, unhappy as a many time married widow, her first husband being killed in the original Godfather. She lives on the sufferance and tolerance of her brother. Now in The Godfather: Part III she takes an active interest in the family business and the family legacy. She realizes more than Pacino there's no escaping the Corleone roots. She champions Garcia as the new Don, she knows he's got the chops for the job, she hopes he can develop the smarts as does Pacino.Eli Wallach contributes a fine performance as another aging crime Don who's got a lot more to him than when we first meet him. Raf Vallone plays Pope John Paul I and the urban legend of his sudden demise after a one month papacy is woven into the Corleone story. As is Joe Mantegna who plays an undisguised version of Brooklyn mob boss Joe Columbo.I'm sure if the money's right and a workable screenplay is developed we may not have seen the last of the Corleones. There was one talked about a few years ago. Still if it never develops, The Godfather: Part III is a fine film to end the saga.",10,51,81,22 March 2008
Zombieland," The Worst Case Of The Munchies Ever
","I have to say that when I went to see Zombieland I wasn't quite prepared for what I was getting. When it started out I honestly thought it was a variation on the Charlton Heston science fiction classic, The Omega Man which also dealt with some human survivors of a plague that's left the rest of humanity the victim of some horrid disease.Instead I got a good natured farce of a film about this same kind of apocalyptic event. The action is narrated by one of four survivors who find themselves thrown together in this case college student Jesse Eisenberg. The other three are Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin. These characters are not referred to by name, merely places either destinations or places of origin.Harrelson has the best most broadly expansive role in the film. It's a scenery chewing part and Harrelson dines on it the way those zombies devour surviving humans.I never did get just exactly how this disease spread and why these four should have been so lucky to be spared. Usually those details are important in science fiction, but I got swept up in the general enjoyment that the cast was having with this film that I didn't care after a while.I agree with other reviewers that this film is destined to become a cult classic. Another future Rocky Horror Picture Show has been born.",8,3,6,13 October 2009
It's a Wonderful Life," 'To My Big Brother George, The Richest Man In Town'
","I've always thought that the reason It's A Wonderful Life has had such enduring popularity is that more than in any other film it shows what can be the value of a single individual and the contribution to the greater good they can make.George Bailey as portrayed by James Stewart is the kind of every man hero we can all identify with. He's got the every day problems to be sure, raising and providing for a family, but he's got bigger problems than that. Fate has made him the rallying point of opposition in his small town of Bedford Falls to the 'richest and meanest man in town', embodied in Lionel Barrymore.It's a real David vs. Goliath battle. Barrymore seems to have unlimited resources at his disposal. Samuel S. Hinds as Peter Bailey put it so well to him in asking what are you doing all this for? Barrymore does have more money than he could ever possibly use. A little charity wouldn't hurt him.Remember the basic plot outline. A whole lot of people in Bedford Falls one post World War II Christmas Eve see that their friend George is toting a heavy load of mysterious origins. Their prayers reach the heavens where an angel is dispatched to aid.But before Henry Travers the angel arrives, he's given the story of George Bailey's life. And we see the kind of struggles he's had, the sacrifices he's made for the good of a whole lot of others. We've also seen a greedy and grasping Potter, grabbing everything that George Bailey cannot save. Something happens that day before Christmas through no fault of his own, Bailey is in big trouble. It's driven him to the brink of despair. That's why the angel is sent down. He shows him the alternate universe that would have been had he never existed. It's something each and every one of us should try to do, step outside ourselves see just what our contributions can be.But I think what Frank Capra is trying to say in this greatest of his films is that having done that and we realize we haven't contributed to the greater good of humankind, we resolve to do so. It's a simple, but profound lesson.What if Potter got the same opportunity? In a sense Charles Dickens did just that in A Christmas Carol. Would Lionel Barrymore change? It's an interesting point of speculation.In addition to those cast members already mentioned a whole group of players who worked with Capra before grace this film. Add to that some others and you have a perfectly cast feature picture.Donna Reed has an interesting part as well. Your choice of mate is real important in life. Had she not been as loving and supportive to George Bailey, he might very well have taken a different route in life. Mary Hatch Bailey became a signature part for her, more identified than her role in From Here to Eternity which got her an Oscar. It certainly was the basis for her TV series.When Todd Karns who plays Harry Bailey toasts his brother he's saying that the riches of the world are not necessarily things that can be quantified. Your life is not measured in material things, but in how you use the material things given you. And that universal lesson will be taught into eternity as long as It's A Wonderful Life is shown every year. Wouldst we all learn it.",10,151,178,25 December 2005
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Brangelina
","Back when Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie were getting more attention than any couple since Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton it seemed serendipitous that Mr.&Mrs. Smith arrived as a film vehicle to take advantage of all that publicity. It certainly features the sex appeal of both. With a lot of violence thrown in as well. In fact the violence is positively erotic at times.Pitt and Jolie are a pair of hit people who work for different arms of the federal government and if you can believe it have no idea what the other does. They get assigned from their agencies to the same case, but one to protect, the other to destroy a target played by Adam Brody. After that they learn of each other and try to kill each other.Even before Jolie was raiding tombs as Lara Croft she certainly had the fighting skills and spirit. Looking at the two of them I really got the impression they were having some great fun together. That fact really permeates your experience watching Mr.&Mrs. Smith.Just beware lest you think that this is remake of the Alfred Hitchcock film Mr.&Mrs. Smith. That it's not, but these Smiths are enjoyable enough as is.",6,1,3,17 July 2016
The Departed," Moles And Rats
","When The Departed finally gained for Martin Scorsese a Best Director Oscar it was felt it might have been for the work of a lifetime. It's not my favorite Scorsese film, that honor belongs to Casino for me. But it certainly was the Best Film of that year as well, rivaled in my humble opinion by Blood Diamond.Instead of an Italian atmosphere for The Departed, Scorsese decided to use the Boston Irish who are the dominant group of that city in everything including crime. The film is simple enough, the police want to take down organized crime kingpin Jack Nicholson who plays a character named Frank Costello. That was Scorsese's little joke because the real Frank Costello was one of the Mafia overlords back in the day, although his real name was an Italian one.Nicholson's character is based on Whitey Bulger who was the real life organized crime chieftain of the Boston area. He came from a really interesting family because a brother of his William Bulger had a long political career that culminated in that Bulger being elected President of the Massachusetts State Senate. I didn't add the word distinguished because scandal crept around that man all his life.Getting this man won't be easy because he has a full bag of tricks. One of them being that years ago he put a young man played by Matt Damon through the Boston Police Academy, concealing a juvenile record and Damon moved gradually up the ranks and got to work in the Boston PD Internal Affairs Division. A great spot for a mole to keep an eye on pending investigations.But the Boston PD has put one of their own undercover in the person of Leonardo DiCaprio whose family knows Nicholson from the neighborhood. At that point the whole film becomes a cat and mouse game on both sides with each having their informants on the other side. There are no dummies on either side, the police aren't keystone cops and the criminals as shrewd and brutal as they come. Scorsese probably had a lot of help in having both Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg in the cast. Both of these players are well known for their Boston roots and they fit really well into their parts. Mark Wahlberg for his role as one of the task force trying to take Nicholson down got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. He lost to Alan Arkin for Little Miss Sunshine. Wahlberg was the only one who came up short at Oscar time. The Departed won additional Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing to go with the Best Picture And Best Director Oscars for Scorsese. Leonardo DiCaprio had a career year, he might have been nominated himself if he wasn't up for Best Actor in Blood Diamond.The real Whitey Bulger is 80 years old now and in real life he was as full of tricks as Nicholson's character is in the film. If you think you know how this film ends, I guarantee you will be wrong. Nicholson's character has survived in many ways, that's all I can say.Scorsese has a nice feel for Boston's atmosphere, as good as what he had for Goodfellas in New York and Casino in Las Vegas. He assembled a great cast of people who all got a crack at working with one of the best film directors of all time. The cast didn't let Martin down at Oscar time and they won't let you down when you see it on the big screen or the small.",10,5,9,7 December 2009
Psycho," Cleaning Up After Mom
","During the Mid Eighties I attended a science fiction convention in Manhattan and the feature attraction there was Anthony Perkins. There was Mr. Perkins, the celebrated Norman Bates of Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho among all the Trekkies and Doctor Who fans, etc. I think he looked on it as an opportunity to promote the succeeding Psycho films.Tony Perkins was clearly ill at ease among the Sci-Fi crowd. People like the Star Trek cast members know what to expect at these gatherings and act accordingly. Perkins did not really know how to handle the banter, he was in my estimation a serious guy who must have thought he was in a freak show. I asked him about appearing in Friendly Persuasion with Gary Cooper and I told him that that was my favorite role he did. He looked grateful that someone knew he did something besides Norman Bates.But for better or worse, Norman Bates became his career role and it's what we remember Anthony Perkins for. He does create an indelible impression on the screen with Alfred Hitchcock's direction as the shy mother fixated man running a flea bag motel in an area where a new super highway has taken all the potential business.Psycho has a simple plot. Janet Leigh on an impulse embezzles $40,000 in cash from her employer and goes on the run. She winds up in the Bates motel run by Norman and his mother. Later on private detective Martin Balsam goes after her as well. And finally John Gavin as Leigh's boy friend and Vera Miles as her sister go looking for the both of them. Simple enough, but Alfred Hitchcock creates a mood of terror and suspense that lingers long after you've seen the film. My favorite shot of the film is not Leigh's legendary shower stabbing, but of Martin Balsam being knocked down and falling down that flight of stairs and then being stabbed to death. The camera work showing Balsam falling backwards is the most terrifying part of Psycho.Though Anthony Perkins did so many other good things, the average cinema fan will tell you 99 out of 100 times that Norman Bates is the role he remembers Perkins for. So Perkins went with the flow.It was repetitious for him, but a treat for fans.",9,6,10,18 October 2006
When Harry Met Sally...," It took long enough
","Nora Ephron's original screenplay was the only Academy recognition for When Harry Met Sally received when it was nominated. I think it's a funny film, but I'm not as big a fan of it as some are.It's the story of Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan who take 12 years and 90 minutes plus of film footage to realize they are right for each other. I think the concept interesting but it is also good for maybe a 20 minute sketch as opposed to a feature film.Meg Ryan's faux orgasm scene at the restaurant is still the scene most remembered from the movie and she certainly carries it off with breathtaking style. Some bemused underplaying is done by friends Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher who keep wondering why these two just don't kanoodle and be done with it. My favorite scene is the contrasting split screen phone calls from Crystal to Kirby and from Ryan to Fisher describing the long awaited big event.It took long enough.",6,2,3,20 August 2015
Crazy Heart," Picking Up Your Life
","Crazy Heart was shot on a relatively small budget and in less than a month. But it proved to be one of those films that kind of sneaks up on the movie-going public. And you don't necessarily have to be a country and western fan to appreciate it.Jeff Bridges stars and is essentially the whole show as an over the hill country and western icon who's reduced to playing cheap honky-tonks in those states where this music predominates. At one time he had a prot√©g√©, a Toby Keith like new country star played by Colin Farrell, but in those famous words from On The Waterfront, Bridges is riding on his one way ticket to Palookaville and the ride isn't finished.Substance abuse has ruined this man's life and it actually looks like Farrell is going the same way if he doesn't watch himself. But Bridges meets up with young divorced journalist Maggie Gyllenhaal with a young son and a crisis with the young kid convinces Bridges he'd better mend his ways.Supposedly Bridges modeled his Oscar winning performance on Kris Kristofferson. I saw that and a bit of Willie Nelson in Bridges on the screen. Whatever he did it sure worked because this is the role of a lifetime.Besides the Best Actor Oscar that Jeff Bridges won, Crazy Heart has a nice score of country songs of which The Weary Kind won the film's second Oscar for Best Song. It's a good song on its own merits, but it also isn't like there's much to choose from in that category, hasn't been in a couple of generations.And you don't have to be a fan of Jeff Bridges or country music to appreciate what a great little film Crazy Heart is.",8,2,3,31 January 2011
War of the Worlds," Blue Collar Protagonist
","Stephen Spielberg took the 1953 classic War Of The Worlds and remade it for modern times and the modern techniques of special effects. A lot of things that could not be done back in the 50s are done now to show the havoc that the invaders reek upon the world. He also did something else that possibly might have offended science fiction purists but I think gave the audience a better identification with the protagonists of the story. Instead of having his protagonists be scientists as Gene Barry and Ann Robinson were in 1953, Tom Cruise is a blue collar divorced father who has his kids visiting him, but custody is with their mother Miranda Otto.The kids are no prizes and are played by Justin Chatwyn and Dakota Fanning. And Cruise himself is no bargain either. But when danger develops it's his idea to take them from New York to Boston where their mother and maternal grandparents are. The film as it was in 1953 is mostly concerned with their efforts to avoid the terrible tripod machines that the aliens use in their destructive path.The film does follow the Barry/Robinson escape scenario closely. The two had a scene avoiding the aliens while they were trapped in a cellar. To that Spielberg adds survivalist Tim Robbins. I think Stephen Spielberg feels the way I do that a lot of these survivalists pray for their doomsday fantasy to come true. That was sure the case with Tim Robbins who is quite mad on the subject of the invaders.Cruise himself centers and anchors the film with his portrayal of blue collar America who just wants for him and his family to survive the holocaust. This classic may yet see a remake or three in the future.",7,4,7,3 November 2013
All Quiet on the Western Front," Wilhelmine Perspective
","Erich Maria Remarque's novel and the film made from it may possibly be the greatest anti-war statement ever created. All Quiet on the Western Front won a deserved Best Picture Academy Award in the year it came out and brought great prestige to Universal Pictures as the first Oscar in that category won by that studio.Lew Ayres is the student leader of a bunch of German school boys in 1914 who listen to the voice of their school master and enlist in the war that's just been declared. The whole class enlists and that's not hyperbole because in Germany at the time it was the boys who got the education and the girls if they got it, got it separately from the boys. I'm sure that viewers of All Quiet on the Western Front today probably are asking why that school master and so many of his generation were urging their youth on to such folly. Very simply that their generation had a quick victory in 1870 in the Franco-Prussian War. Every generation since wars were recorded figures their war experience will be the same for their children.Only it wasn't. On the western front the Allied and Central Powers armies were locked in a bitter stalemate that ran diagonally across France and Belgium from the English Channel to the Swiss border. This went on for a little over four years. In fact had it not been for the fact that America joined the Allied side and the French and British held out until they did, I'm sure an honest armistice would have been declared long before November 11, 1918.You lived, fought and died in those trenches. Either you were defending or you were attacking the other guy's trenches against murderous automatic weapon fire and long distance artillery batteries. All Quiet on the Western Front was the first great war film of the American sound era and graphically shows that.And it shows that from the enemy perspective. That's something today's audience can't appreciate, the fact that the film was from the Wilhelmine German perspective. Remember these were the enemy a dozen years before. But the experience in the trenches was universal.Lew Ayres became a star with this film and it effected him so deeply that he became a committed pacifist which caused later problems in his career. He's the voice of reason and civilization and the voice of a lost generation of Germans who would never have listened to the demagogic appeals of the Nazis. Louis Wolheim plays the veteran soldier who befriends Ayres and his school boy chums and teaches them how to survive in the trenches. It turned out to be his greatest role. He was a brutish looking man and played mostly those types in silent films. All Quiet on the Western Front would have been the start of a whole new career opening. But Wolheim died the following year just as he was to start filming The Front Page. Adolphe Menjou took the part of Walter Burns in that film which Wolheim was to have.The third really stand out performance is that of John Wray who some might remember as the brutal prison guard in Each Dawn I Die. Wray plays an officious mail man who is in the German Army Reserve. He gets called up and this little nobody gets rather impressed with himself and his new found authority as a training sergeant to Ayres and his friends. Later on at the front, he gets a view of combat he wasn't quite ready for.All Quiet on the Western Front with its eternal message of peace and life will be one eternal film, it will be shown and appreciated for many generations to come.",10,111,124,15 March 2006
12 Years a Slave," Degradation and Despair
","During the days of the big studio system slavery was a topic that was generally avoided. The standard interpretation of the era's history made such work as Birth Of A Nation and later Gone With The Wind the way we saw the era. It was the Civil Rights Revolution that opened a lot eyes and now with a bit of perspective there, a film like the incredible true story 12 Years A Slave could be made.Not only is it true what happens to Chiwetel Ejifor's character this was hardly a unique situation. Slave catchers were really down on the social scale even at that time, but it was a business to them. So of course if you can't find a genuine runaway slave, why just take any black person that answers a general description. Naturally free black people were on the alert, but these two low lifes who capture him use stealth and planning to bring him to the south and sell him.This story of degradation and despair is a future cinema classic and ought to be required viewing in schools and for those who think any group of human kind deserves to be treated in this way. Slave owners knew exactly what they were doing when it was forbidden to educate a slave. If you remember in Band Of Angels Clark Gable did educate the child who grew up to be Sidney Poitier almost to his dying regret. The hardest thing that Ejifor has to do is conceal his education in order to survive.Michael Fassbender plays the last and worst of a series of plantation owners who Ejifor is in slavery to. Fassbender is amazing to watch as his character sinks into moral degeneracy as more and more he has to justify this system. The saddest story in the film is not our protagonist's. Rather it is that of Lupita Nyong'o who plays a woman separated from her children when she's sold off in a slave market which is placed in someone's parlor. The degradation and misery she endures can only be compared to Schindler's List and clearly 12 Years A Slave was influenced by that Spielberg masterpiece. You have to a Medusa victim not to be moved by Nyong'o on the screen.",9,8,16,29 January 2014
To Kill a Mockingbird," Our Greatest Film Hero
","When the American Film Institute polled its members and they selected Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch as the greatest hero on film ever, the selection was met with very few dissenters. I'm sure not going to argue the merits of the choice. But I do have a theory as to why.Gregory Peck for the most part played decent honorable thinking men in his films. A few films like Duel in the Sun and The Boys from Brazil have him as a villain, but the public never accepted him really in those parts.Few of us in our lives can be Horatio Hornblower or spike the Guns of Navarone or command a submarine as in On the Beach. But Atticus Finch in To Kill a Mockingbird is well within our grasp. He's a small town lawyer, raising his children as a single parent and most of all trying to lead them by example. The performances of Mary Badham and Philip Alford show the kids have learned it very well as does the uncredited narration of Kim Stanley as the grown-up Scout.Atticus Finch is a very attainable ideal. It is I believe the secret of the popularity of both the book and the film. To Kill a Mockingbird is the story of Atticus Finch and his family during the Thirties in rural Alabama. The action takes place over several months of a given year. The most important part of the film deals with Finch defending a black man for allegedly raping a white woman. It's a thankless task and Finch knows it, because he knows the attitudes of the people there, those who would make up an all white jury. Still he proceeds with courage and determination. His summation to the jury is a film classic and Peck's innate decency is nicely counterbalanced by William Windom's prosecutor who smirks through out the trial knowing he just has to play the race card to win.Other outstanding performances are Brock Peters as the man Peck is defending, James Anderson as the father of the girl he's accused of violating, and Frank Overton as the county sheriff.This film was the debut of Robert Duvall in the part of Boo Radley who plays the autistic neighbor of the Finches. No dialog at all for Duvall who conveys great and pained emotion with a series of expressions that are unforgettable. Duvall played a similar role in another Peck film, Captain Newman, MD.Gregory Peck got the Best Actor Award for 1962. He was up against some very stiff competition that year. Peck beat out Jack Lemmon for Days of Wine and Roses, Burt Lancaster for Birdman of Alcatraz, Peter O'Toole for Lawrence of Arabia and Marcello Mastroianni for Divorce Italian style. No doubt sentiment did play a part in the final award. Lemmon and Lancaster had already gotten Oscars and O'Toole and Mastroianni were relative newcomers. But I sure think the Academy selection that year has stood the test of time.This film has sure stood the same test.",10,41,51,27 January 2006
The Bridge on the River Kwai," The Perks of Being An Officer
","The Bridge on the River Kwai is about a culture clash of two different races going to war and how they view each other. It's also about a British colonel's concern for the morale of his men and observation of the rules of war that it blinds him to the situation he's in.I like to compare The Bridge on the River Kwai with The Great Escape. Though the prisoners in the former are in a far worse predicament than those in that 'escape proof' stalag in the latter, note the differences in how they view their captivity. No one in The Great Escape ever forgets that they are at war and who the enemy. Their morale is kept very high with the diabolical escape plan they devise.Alec Guinness who is a stickler for protocol reminds us that escape might not be justified under the rules because they were ordered to surrender. But as prisoners he will not be denied the rank and privileges of being an officer. So he gets the sweat box until the commandant, Sessue Hayakawa, gives in for his own reasons.His reasons involve the building of a bridge on a railway the Japanese are constructing from Bangkok to Rangoon, part of their Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity scheme. Hayakawa reminds us that his code of honor is Bushido, the Samurai code which does not entertain surrender. The British to him are an inferior people for doing that and not fighting until the last man.That's not going to sit well with Guinness who's going to show the Japanese who's inferior. He notes that the bridge being built is not sound structurally and he determines that to combat the idleness of the men and the bad effect on morale, he'll build a bridge that will show Hayakawa who's inferior. And Hayakawa loses control of his own bridge construction to the enemy and breaks down because of it.The Bridge on the River Kwai as a film wouldn't work at all if it were not for Alec Guinness. He's clearly not kept his eye on the ball to use an American baseball term, forgotten that two countries are at war, that it's not a private spat between him and Hayakawa. Yet his concern for his men is genuine and he must have been a pretty good commander in a combat situation to retain the affection his men have for him. Executing the complexity of Colonel Nicholson won him the Academy Award and it carries the film.Taking a different view of the perks of being an officer is William Holden. His role is not in the original novel by Pierre Boule, but was created to justify a big American box office name for the USA market. But it was a good thing because Holden as an American does bring a different perspective to the events. Holden having won his Oscar in Stalag 17 as a prisoner of war brings his former role of Sefton to this film. That's not as flip as it sounds because Sefton in Stalag 17 did remark about escaping and then being sent to the Pacific and getting captured and doing time in a Japanese prison. Of course he'd have had to have changed branches of the service. And we never do learn Holden's real name.Seems as though when his ship went down, Holden the survivor exchanges uniform and dog tags with a Navy commander named Shears. It doesn't get him quite the perks he thought he'd get, but he's resourceful enough.It took me several viewings of The Bridge on the River Kwai to figure out why Holden didn't go back to his real name and rank after he escaped and after he arrived in the British hospital in Sri Lanka. It's the reason why Ann Sears has a small, but critical role as the WREN that Holden enjoys a little romantic idyll with. She might not have given him the time of day if he was a seaman first class instead of a Lieutenant Commander. But the British get on to Holden's charade and Jack Hawkins blackjacks him into going on a mission to destroy the bridge that British Intelligence has found out the Japanese are building. If Guinness has forgotten what side he's on, Hawkins sure hasn't. Jack Hawkins's role tends to get overshadowed by Guinness and he never gets the credit due him for this film, but he does well as the determined man on a mission.One other part worthy mentioning is James Donald as the medical officer of Guinness's battalion. He has great affection for Guinness, but apparently he's the only one in the POW camp that sees the implication of what the British prisoners are being ordered to do by their commander and also who'll tell Guinness ever so gently.And Donald puts the final coda on The Bridge on the River Kwai with his words that end this great film achievement.",10,8,13,1 September 2006
A Hard Day's Night," 'It's Been A Hard Day's Night And I'm Working Like A Dog.'
","I first saw this film way back in the day. Saw it, didn't hear or understand much of it, what with all those pubescent young females screaming their lungs out in the audience. When the young females were resting I had to contend with the Fab Four's Liverpudlian speech patterns which were as yet unfamiliar to me. Still very few soundtracks produced as many hits as did A Hard Day's Night.As much as The Beatles themselves revolutionized popular music, A Hard Day's Night also was a revolutionary film of its own. What you're seeing here is nothing less than the first music video, albeit a rather lengthy 90+ minute one.Director Richard Lester wisely eschewed the idea of a plot and basically did a docucomedy with songs about 12 hours in the life of John, Paul, George, and Ringo. They gave Paul a grandfather, played by Wilfred Brambell who when he wasn't getting into mischief on his own was influencing Ringo to spread his wings so to speak. Will Ringo get back to the studio in time for the big Broacast? Actually 32 years before that in Paramount's The Big Broadcast the same was asked of straying Bing Crosby. Of course you know the answer.A Hard Day's Night is must viewing for anyone who's trying to learn about the sixties. Or somebody who just likes the music of Paul McCartney and the lyrics of John Lennon.",8,7,8,2 February 2008
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," The Ultimate Backfire
","It took a dozen years for One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest to make it to the big screen from Broadway. In 1962 Kirk Douglas made his one and only return to Broadway to star as Randall P. McMurphy on stage with Joan Tetzel as his nemesis, nurse Ratched. Douglas bought the screen rights, but by the time anyone was interested in doing the film version, Kirk was too old for the part.That may have been a break for the movie fans because as much as I like Kirk Douglas, I can't see anyone but Jack Nicholson doing this role as the free spirited McMurphy. McMurphy's a low level career criminal type who statutorily raped a girl as he put it '15 going on 35'. He decides to fake a crazy act while in prison to get out of the work farm he's assigned to.So Nicholson's goes to the mental hospital where he meets an odd assortment of people whom he discovers voluntarily checked themselves in there, mainly because it's easier to stay there and not take all your psychological baggage into society. That's a crucial difference that Nicholson finds out the hard way, his new friends most of them can pack up and leave anytime they want. He's sent there by the state and the state determines when he's ready to go even if it's past the allotted jail time he was sentenced to.The state in this case is Louise Fletcher as Nurse Ratched, one of the great Dickensian names ever given a movie character. Louise is the ultimate control freak and these people who've shut themselves away from life are her ultimate tools. When Nicholson comes in, he hasn't given up on life like the rest of these poor souls, he becomes a threat to Fletcher's little empire.It's hard to believe that such a smart guy like McMurphy would not have known the rules about commitment. Still it doesn't detract a bit from the overall quality of One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest.Though the topic is not a fixed one to any era, the script does leave many oblique references to the Sixties in the film. The electroshock treatment and the lobotomy operations depicted here were by 1975 no longer in use. They were pretty barbaric and the mental health profession discarded these, but not before too many lives were shattered with them. One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest swept the main Oscar categories, it won for Best Picture, Best Director for Milos Forman, Best Actor for Jack Nicholson, Best Actress for Louise Fletcher and Best Adapted Screenplay to Lawrence Hauban and Bo Goldman. Brad Dourif was nominated for Best Supporting Actor, but he lost to George Burns in The Sunshine Boys.Louise Fletcher never got the career mileage she should have for playing Nurse Ratched. It took her years, but she did get another career role in television as the ruler of Bejor, Kai Winn on Star Trek Deep Space Nine.One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is one timeless classic, it will be popular a millenia from now.",10,13,17,15 January 2009
The Wolf of Wall Street," Reserved for the male of the species
","The Wolf Of Wall Street details the rise and fall in real life of one Jordan Belfort who for a while was living high and wide off of other people's money. It was good while it lasted until some relentless FBI agents took him down partly because of his own hubris.Leonardo DiCaprio as he did with such other real life figures like Howard Hughes and J. Edgar Hoover, each of who lived large in his own way with power, DiCaprio lives large with money. At first it's the realization of the American dream, DiCaprio the middle class kid wants to go on Wall Street. He goes, but then is one of thousands cast adrift by the stock market crash of the late Reagan years. DiCaprio is not about to give up his dream.He organizes his own brokerage house, similar to what is seen in the more modestly financed film The Boiler Room. But DiCaprio takes it far from a penny stock outfit. With a collection of his own ill assorted bunch of friends chief among them is Jonah Hill, these guys and I do mean it is reserved for the male of the species DiCaprio makes obscene amounts of money and spends it obscenely. That is sure to attract all kinds of law enforcement attention.I have seen very few films that have depicted the alpha male world so well. Women just do not compete in DiCaprio's world. All they serve as are sex objects. Women work on Wall Street in the more traditional brokerage houses, but not with him where being one of the boys is the first requirement. The world consists of 50% orgies and 50% piling up paper profits and later on hiding them from authorities. True of DiCaprio and true to a lesser extent of all his associates.Martin Scorsese directed this film and handled the film like he did one of his gangster epics like Goodfellas. The narration of the film is by DiCaprio and it takes you from his rise to where law enforcement has him between a rock and a hard place. Like Ray Liotta in Goodfellas a combination of drugs and hubris makes him think he's invulnerable. But in Goodfellas would not have had a scene where the wise guys just out and out dared to challenge the FBI as DiCaprio does with agent Kyle Chandler. It so reminded me of that famous incident from 1984 where presidential candidate Gary Hart dares reporters to follow him around to catch him doing anything outside his marriage. And of course they did.Five Oscar nominations went to The Wolf Of Wall Street, nominations for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay and nominations for DiCaprio and Jonah Hill as Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor. Hill was something of a revelation. The kind of nondescript character that you wouldn't look at twice, Hill gets taken to a world that he could only imagine in dreams wet or dry by DiCaprio. In his own Hill is almost as fascinating a story as DiCaprio.The guy who beat Leo out for Best Actor has a brief but telling role as a mentor of sorts. Matthew McConaughey plays a stockbroker who takes him under his wing and they have a great scene at a club where he's getting his first three martini lunch. McConaughey only forgets to teach DiCaprio one thing, discretion.I can understand why women would truly hate this film as they are nothing more than pawns in a male power game, but The Wolf Of Wall Street gives us a fascinating look at a man who tried to play with the big boys of the Stock Exchange and for a while, did.",8,79,136,11 April 2014
Bram Stoker's Dracula," The Most Famous Vampire Of All
","Although it is not possible to ever replace Bela Lugosi as Count Dracula, Gary Oldman offers us an interesting interpretation of the most famous of vampires in Francis Ford Coppola's version of Dracula. This film is probably closest to the novel that Bram Stoker wrote which in fact is a series of recollections of the events of the story by its various characters.Added to it is a prequel where we see that the Count back in the 17th century was a warrior repelling the Ottoman Turk invasion. But on arriving home from the wars, Oldman discovers that his beloved has died. Cursing the Deity, the Deity gets back at him by leaving him undead with a thirst for human blood. His beloved is played by Winona Ryder.Flash forward to the end of the 19th century and the story picks up in many ways from the classic film with Bela Lugosi. Dracula has moved his base of operations to London to be near the reincarnated version of his true love, also played by Winona Ryder. She's slightly engaged to Keanu Reeves who is held as a prisoner by Dracula's demon wives after closing the deal on Carfax Abbey in London.Dr. Van Helsing is played by Anthony Hopkins who dusts off the accent that Laurence Olivier perfected back in the day. Hopkins does overact a bit here, but the part is a showy one, almost as much as the title role.I did see a college production of the play made from Stoker's novel and this one was closer than any other Dracula I've seen. But with all due respect to the fine cast involved, there will never be another Bela.",7,1,3,23 November 2010
"Hail, Caesar!"," You'll recognize the stars
","The Coen Brothers who gave us one of my favorite 90s films Fargo to a crack at Hollywood of the studio era in Hail Caesar. The film had potential for greatness, but it fails in too many places. The real life character of Eddie Mannix of the real life studio of MGM is given his own studio to run, the mythical Capital Pictures. Mannix had a deserved reputation as a tough guy and a formal Catholic in the Jewish world of Louis B. Mayer and Irving Thalberg. He was a tough guy who knew more celebrity secrets than J. Edgar Hoover. He buried many a scandal at MGM and now he heads his own studio.You'll recognize the satire on a lot of familiar Hollywood faces from the 30s and 40s. George Clooney as Charlton Heston kidnapped by Communist writers and held for revolutionary ransom was way over the top and sad to say doesn't do either Heston or the blacklist any justice.Frances McDormand's character of Mannix who is played by Josh Brolin is not easily recognizable. But Ida Koverman who was Louis B. Mayer's faithful scribe also kept secrets well and kept Mayer's life in order.My two favorites were Tilda Swinton as twin gossip columnists who had the same scent for scandal as Hedda and Louella did. The second was Alden Ehrenreich as a Gene Autry type singing cowboy. The scene where Brolin puts him into a sophisticated comedy where director Ralph Fiennes is trying to teach him some acting technique is my favorite in the film. Imagine trying to remake Gene Autry into Cary Grant. You'll recognize a lot of the movie immortals. Some got more justice than others. Channing Tatum is in sailor musical where he's doing a number like Gene Kelly. I'll bet Tatum worked as hard as Kelly to get it right.Some old timers like me and devoted watchers of TCM will enjoy Hail Caesar. But it could have been a lot better.",6,0,2,22 August 2016
The Mission," What You Do Unto The Least Of My Brethren
","It's a sad fact of life that hunter gatherer cultures even when slavery is not in the mix will always give way to societies higher up on the sociological scale. No one says its right, it just is. The Mission deals with the tragedy of such a situation in South America in the 18th century.Slavery was in the mix here however, practiced in the open by the Portugese and winked at by the Spanish where their king's writ ran. The area were concerned with in South America in 1758 is that area of the Amazon headwaters where the boundary between Brazil and Peru is not really to clear. Christianity was a both a savior and destroyer of animist Indian tribes back then in both American continents. It certainly did have as a message that their culture and beliefs were altogether wrong and have to change. But there are also numerous recorded incidents where priests and we are talking about the Catholic Church here put their lives and reputations on the line to defend these primitive societies from the evils of the civilization they were bringing.Such an admirable priest is Jeremy Irons in The Mission. He's aided and abetted by Robert DeNiro a former slaver who became a monk, renouncing civilization after killing his brother Aidan Quinn in a fight over a woman. The tribe they are working with and actually gaining trust and even some converts has been earmarked to be captured and used as slave labor over in Portugese territory.The Mission is told in flashback as Cardinal Ray McAnally is writing a report to the Pope of what is happening in South America. And in many ways what is still happening there.The Mission got seven Oscar nominations including best picture and won the Oscar in 1986 for best cinematography. The performances are some of the best that all the principal players have ever given on screen. The story is a tragic one, but with a message of hope that there are indeed people like Irons and DeNiro for whom the positive aspects of their religion is not just platitudes.The best way to see The Mission is back to back with At Play In The Fields Of The Lord which is a 20th century look at the same problem. Both films are among the best made in the past 30 years.",10,5,5,8 February 2010
The Green Mile," The Least Of us
","I'm glad that a number of reviewers have informed me that this highly unusual tale was a faithful adaption from the novel by Stephen King. I'm not much of a fiction reader so it is gratifying to hear that his vision got to the screen intact. I would not have guessed this film would have come from a horror story writer. No monsters from the id or any place else are present in this story set in the American South of the Thirties. But demons do exist in The Green Mile and there is a man named John Coffey who takes them unto himself.The Green Mile refers to the cell block housing the inmates scheduled for Death Row. In that cell block comes Michael Clarke Duncan who is close to seven feet tall and maybe weighing 400 pounds. He's also as docile as a baby lamb and whose only request is that they leave a night light burning because he gets a little afraid of a strange place in the dark.Of course the guards who have the typical white Alabama attitudes of the day don't quite know what to make of them, but Tom Hanks who captains the cell block and most of the rest find out just how special he is. And Hanks cannot believe that someone like Duncan could possibly be guilty of a double rape/murder of a child.This modern day parable of the Jesus story has King telling us that it is very possible that many of his kind have walked the earth with talents for healing. One of them got a religion worked around him, but they can come in all walks of life and certainly no one would expect one to come in the guise of an illiterate black Alabama sharecropper. But one of my favorite Bible verses has Jesus himself saying that what you do unto the least of my brethren you do unto me.Somebody of Michael Clarke Duncan's size and build is not going to get too many really good roles and he certainly hasn't played anything remotely like John Coffey again. Parts like that don't come along and the film seems almost to have been built around him. It's one of the most moving performance that has ever been put on film in history. And it's an incredibly difficult role, he's meek for his size and Uncle Tom like, but as we learn far from it. In fact Coffey is beyond what the ordinary human mind can comprehend. Duncan received one of four Academy Award nominations that The Green Mile got, in his case for Best Supporting Actor. Since the film is built around him, my only question is why was it the Supporting Actor category?The Green Mile was also nominated for Best Picture, Best Sound and Best Adapted Screenplay, but did not come home a winner in any of these. A pity that one of the best films of the Nineties could not get at least one Oscar.Where there's a Christ-like figure you also have some devil spawn villains and we have a pair of them in Sam Rockwell as another death row prisoner and David Hutchison as a rat of a prison guard with both connections and issues. What happens to them is both poetic and diabolical in true Stephen King tradition. Others in the cast of note are Bonnie Hunt as Mrs. Hanks, James Cromwell and Patricia Clarkson as the warden and his wife, David Morse and Barry Pepper as two other guards on the block and Michael Jeter as another prisoner with a remarkably trained 'circus' mouse.The Green Mile is a remarkable allegorical picture and might be considered for Easter time viewing if it has a season. It certainly will make folks think.",10,14,20,7 December 2009
Jaws," A different skill to the hunt
","I've always had a theory of why Jaws is such a frightening film for so many people. It is because we are challenging the shark which maybe the most perfect killing and eating machine in nature in his own habitat. We are land creatures, we cannot breath in water, we can only hold our breath going under for a limited time. Even with scuba apparatus we are no match for the shark in the place where he lives and breathes. So when one of them gets real close to our land habitat and starts killing off swimmers we frighten easily because any one of us could be his victim if we dare venture in the water.It's this terror that Peter Benchley's novel and Steven Spielberg's film exploits to the max. Jaws is almost like two films put together about the same subject. In the first part when the first shark victim shows up, Roy Scheider as constable of the small island town of Amity Island on the New England coast, he wants to close the beach. But the city fathers led by Murray Hamilton say no way. This is the summer tourist season which the town lives and dies by. Of course a couple of good lawsuits would truly cripple the town, but that fact never seems to enter anyone's thinking. Spielberg truly shows the greed of humankind here. Of course when more shark death occur, then the professionals have to take over.Those professionals are Scheider, oceanographer Richard Dreyfuss and fisherman Robert Shaw who has a boat they can use for shark hunting. He's got first hand experience with sharks, he spent some time in the water as a sailor in the Pacific War with sharks picking off his mates one by one. They each bring a different skill to the hunt.These three are not the most compatible shipmates ever brought together for a common purpose. In fact the conflicts between all three leads drive the film in the last half. When the big great white shark comes calling though it's a tough battle to put him down. Jaws won three Oscars in technical categories, music scoring, sound, and film editing in addition to being nominated for Best Picture in 1975. But it's as much the actors as well as the technical virtuosity of Jaws that make it the great film it is.Centuries from now Jaws will be scaring the pants off people because we're still afraid of what lives in the water.",9,1,4,25 January 2014
The Wrestler," Another Grab for Glory
","I remember years ago going to one of the local wrestling shows in an arena in Queens and the highlight match of the event was between Bob Backlund and the Masked Superstar. This was the kind of show that you see portrayed in The Wrestler, guys who were has beens and never wases in the wrestling game. Only two years earlier that same match topped the Madison Square Garden card of the WWF when Backlund was the heavy weight champion. Neither Backlund or the Masked Superstar looked in the kind of bad physical shape that Mickey Rourke as Randy 'the Ram' Robinson who is about 20 years past his prime.But like Mountain Rivera in Requiem For A Heavyweight, what else does this man know? What else is he trained to do. Maybe he could have been an athletic director at some high school with a bit of education and be living good with some respect. But he stayed too long and a big part of it is that he can't be without the roar of the crowd even if it's some American Legion Hall Charity event.With serious health issues Rourke decides to grab for glory once more with a battle just like Bob Backlund had with the Masked Superstar by going against his former rival nemesis the Ayatollah from the eighties albeit in a smaller venue just like what I was at.Rourke really immerses himself in the character of Randy Robinson you do forget that this is acting, you think you're backstage with all the wrestlers whose bodies take quite a pounding for an exhibit. Rourke's has taken about all it will.Two female roles are of prominence Marisa Tomei who got a Best Supporting Actress nomination as an aging stripper who has been a bit smarter than Rourke about accepting old age. And Evan Rachel Ward playing Rourke's daughter from a long ago marriage who is totally estranged from him.But Tomei was lucky to be noticed because The Wrestler is Mickey Rourke's show completely. This is definitely Mickey Rourke's signature role and sad he came up for an Oscar the year Sean Penn also became Harvey Milk in the same way that Rourke became the Ram.",9,0,0,4 July 2012
Kong: Skull Island," Kong still has an eye for the ladies
","This King Kong story has the big guy never leaving Skull Island. But with Brie Larson along the big guy still has an eye for the ladies though he never becomes obsessed like he was with Fay Wray. It's the end of the Vietnam War, but John Goodman who's a Frank Buck type hunter and explorer with some Capitol Hill influence has gotten the government to underwrite an expedition to a newly discovered uncharted island. He's even gotten the cooperation of the government in this endeavor. An airborne squadron of paratroopers headed by Colonel Samuel L. Jackson are to give him support. These troops ain't real happy as their going stateside is being delayed.This island has all kinds of strange monsters, prehistoric hunter/gatherers. and a big ape who watches over the people and the walled stockade they've built to prevent them from being the lunch special for the monsters. They will need all that military firepower to stay alive and as you can gather very few make it out alive.One thing though, this ain't Jurassic Park where a lot of plant eating dinosaurs are around. Everybody here is a flesh eater. No wonder that vegetation is so lush and so treacherous.Kong: Skull Island I suspect will get a nomination or two in the technical categories next year. It's your old fashioned action/adventure saga where everyone looks like they're having a good time making it. The acting sure shows it.",5,1,2,10 August 2017
Ray," A lover not a fighter
","This is a biopic taken to a whole other level. Watching Ray you really think you're
sitting next to God running a movie of the life of legendary entertainer Ray Charles.I really did think I was looking at Ray Charles the way Jamie Fox so perfectly
captured him in this film. No wonder he received the Best Actor Oscar for his
performance.Ray Charles was born Ray Charles Robinson and lost his sight at the age of seven. But not the gift for music. He dropped the Robinson from his name as
he did not want to be confused with Sugar Ray Robinson the famous welter and middleweight champion. He was a lover not a fighter.Lover he was as he got the women by the bushel basket every place he went.
He married Kerry Washington and his children with her were his official family.
But he was also involved with Regina King and had a son out of wedlock. Probably more than her truth be told.But the other issue here besides music and libido was dope. An occupational
hazard with musicians, but Charles got good and hooked on heroin. His
struggle to get the monkey off his back is a big part of the story.Ray has a huge soundtrack of Ray Charles music and Foxx is just like Larry Parks to Al Jolson. Great soundtrack.And I can't stop loving this film.",8,0,1,24 June 2019
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," HEIGH HO, HEIGH HO, It's Wonderful You Know
","The Walt Disney Studios went a long way towards earning its nickname of The Magic Kingdom with the release of Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs. There will never be another version of the beloved Grimm Brothers fairy tale because you couldn't find all the elements that make this one work so well.I imagine that with today's computer generated graphics you could come up with a more realistic animation. But it would probably frighten the children and in all the wrong places. More than the wicked queen would be frightening folks.Snow White is a tale of imagination, something that lets the kids work their minds and really get into the characters. The voices selected so perfectly match the animated figures. And with the exception of Billy Gilbert they're not known players. Snow White is first and foremost a character driven story. Today the Disney Studio would probably take from their stable of TV and film personalities for voices, but the emphasis would be on the celebrities not the story. I don't think Disney Studios alone would be guilty of that however.Much as I like the simple story, the thing I love best about the film is the musical score that Frank Churchill and Larry Morey wrote. This is the Annie Get Your Gun of animated films, so many different and beloved hits come out of it. Even today you can hear people offhandedly humming 'Heigh Ho, Heigh Ho' and they might not realize where it's from, it's so ingrained in our consciousness, almost like Happy Birthday.A favorite song of mine is the operatic ballad One Song that the prince and Snow White both sing. I have a recording of it that Allan Jones did and it's a gem. It could have come out of a score by Sigmund Romberg or Rudolf Friml, it's that good.The movie DVD is still a hot seller, it's like White Christmas and the other Christmas songs that Bing Crosby did which still keep his name before the public every Yuletide season and keeps making money for his estate. Why is Snow White so popular? Very simply it's one of the best cartoon features every made.",10,10,12,8 December 2009
Shooter," Framing Rambo
","Mark Wahlberg, who got some due recognition for his part as an honest cop in The Departed, slipped back on the greasy pole of acting with his Rambo like portrayal of a guy set up as a presidential assassin.In Shooter, Wahlberg plays Bobby Lee Swagger a Marine trained sharpshooter with an instinct for survival that's taken from Sly Stallone's Rambo films. Including the fact that he self doctor's himself after taking two policeman's bullets.After surviving an incident in Ethiopia where the USA isn't supposed to be having a military presence, Mark is recruited by a mysterious colonel played by Danny Glover to plan a presidential assassination from a distance, something he's an expert at. I mean really, if bells didn't go off in this man's head.Anyway it's a set up, and Wahlberg spends the rest of the film out smarting the entire secret federal government which apparently is headed by a Senator from Montana played by Ned Beatty.Shooter is a film way too caught up in its own agenda of showing the USA to be the big bad Satan of the planet earth. Everybody in the film has done better work and 50 years from now this will not be a big item at a Mark Wahlberg film festival.Nice location photography and special effects. That seems to be what sells cinema in this day and age sometimes.",4,5,13,27 March 2007
Inception," Dream Team
","Watching Inception with its futuristic emphasis on getting inside people's heads through dreams, especially hearing Leonardo DiCaprio explain the pitfalls to newbie Ellen Page, I couldn't help thinking about Forbidden Planet and that warning about monsters from the Id. Did earth manage to conquer what the Krells could not?Christopher Nolan wrote and directed Inception and though it gets a bit heavy at times, it still is an unmistakable masterpiece. Leonardo DiCaprio stars in this and he's essentially a cat burglar of the mind. His mission usually is to invade people's dreams and steal ideas which makes him an invaluable espionage agent. But Leo's also a wanted man.Some problems Leo has relating to his Id have forced him to rely on others to create dream worlds. He was working against Japanese billionaire industrialist Ken Watanabe and got caught, but then Watanabe likes his style and hires Leo and his team to do a job on the young heir to a communications conglomerate, Cillian Murphy. It's not to steal anything, but to plant an idea in his brain with the dream team. The film is essentially how DiCaprio and his crew go about this job with Watanabe incidentally along for the ride. And its how Leo has to deal with some real demons involving guilt that force him to rely on others.Very nice computer graphic generated special effects characterize Inception and it will probably earn an Oscar nomination next year in that category. Director Nolan gets his talented cast to read writer Nolan's dialog with verve and conviction. I truly hope this technology is not in our near future that would be a frightening thought.",9,13,31,21 July 2010
Murder on the Orient Express," Was justice served?
","Kenneth Branagh stars and directed this massive production of Murder On The
Orient Express replete with a lot preliminary back stories. But for the most 
part once we get down to it it's the same old Agatha Christie tale.Having seen the 1973 film that starred Albert Finney as the world famous Belgian 
sleuth and the smaller BBC production that David Suchet did, this runs a distinct
third. You can design wondrful period sets to tell the story in, but this version
is overwhelmed by the opulence. It's still an intimate story told within the
confines of a railroad car.I still remember Albert Finney in the 1973 film giving the solution of the murder of Ratchett telling the other passengers he knows full well what happened. He sure didn't agonize as Branagh does here. A lot of familiar folks like Derek Jacobi, Michelle Pheiffer, Judy Dench etc.
fill out the roles of the passengers in the sleeping car who all have a connection of sorts. Johnny Depp is the American gangster victim and he's
quite serious in the part, no Captain Jack Sparrow scenery chewing.And throughout the entire film I was waiting for the other members of the
barbershop chorus to join Kenneth Branagh in a snappy chorus of Sweet
Adeline. Ken, that walrus mustache was too much.",5,2,3,10 March 2018
Sherlock Holmes," No Black Arts For Sherlock Holmes
","Those fans of the sleuth of Baker Street, let alone those who are devoted to the BBC series with Jeremy Brett will be aghast at what Guy Ritchie has wrought on the big screen. Not to mention those of us who remember Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce.Dusting off the English accent he perfected in Chaplin, Robert Downey, Jr. plays the redoubtable sleuth with Jude Law as Doctor John Watson. But as for the characters that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle created, these two might well have had different names all together. They certainly are one antagonistic pair of roommates. In fact Dr. Watson is tired of Sherlock's pleasure seeking where he's been reduced to a little more than a dope connection. He wants to marry a nice girl played by Kelly Reilly and settle down. He's packed and ready to move when one of Holmes's old cases comes back to haunt him.Holmes put away serial killer Lord Blackwood played by Mark Strong, a nobleman who would have made the Marquis DeSade look like Mister Rogers. Strong is hung for his crimes, but later his grave turns out to be empty and new horrors are happening and awaiting London. It's up to Holmes to stop it.To do it, Downey makes Holmes an action figure and only in The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes, the second of the Rathbone series was Holmes ever this much of a macho dude. It might be fun for fans, but I like my Holmes as cerebral as Conan Doyle wrote him.The film does convey the atmosphere of Victorian London no doubt, but Arthur Conan Doyle would never recognize his creation.",4,4,12,12 January 2010
The Good Shepherd," America Guarded By A Nest of WASPS
","I came away from The Good Shepherd terribly disappointed. A really talented cast was very wasted in this fictional retelling of over 20 years of American espionage. The USA got into the spy game on a permanent basis real late. We had intelligence services during all of our Wars up to World War II. It was deemed something to be handled by the military up until then. Our attitude was best summed up by Henry L. Stimson who said that line about 'gentlemen do not read other gentlemen's mail.' Stimson served in the cabinet of three American presidents and the last one, Franklin D. Roosevelt, had a different view of espionage. Knowing that the USA would be entering World War II sooner or later he felt the need for this country to have an espionage agency, the equal and superior of what our friends and foes had. The man he selected was World War I hero and Congressional Medal of Honor winner, William J. Donovan. In previous films he's been portrayed by George Brent in The Fighting 69th and Joseph Crehan in O.S.S. That is General Sullivan who director Robert DeNiro portrays.Donovan by all accounts did an outstanding job in organizing the Office of Strategic Services. But for some reason the OSS was disbanded after World War II. Bill Donovan ran afoul of Roosevelt's successor Harry S. Truman and there's lots of speculation what caused the rift. Truman's memoirs are silent on the issue. Anyway from 1945 until 1947 when the Central Intelligence Agency was born, we had no espionage agency. Those were critical years and this country played a whole lot of catch up. Donovan aka Sullivan had nothing to do with the CIA, in fact was frozen out of the agency. A whole lot of his people joined it though, including our fictional protagonist Edward Wilson as played by Matt Damon. This is the most glaring factual error of The Good Shepherd.Matt Damon is our WASP type protagonist who joins the OSS after graduation from Yale. He's a member of Skull and Bones, the elite fraternity of Yale and the OSS and CIA did in fact try to recruit among America's WASP first families on the theory that they had the most to lose if the country went down the toilet. Not true however that it was exclusively a WASP preserve.The personal story is the best part. The demands of his job put an unbelievable strain on his marriage, one by the way that resulted from a pregnancy during a one night stand with Angelina Jolie. Look for a good performance by William Hurt as Philip Allen aka Allen Dulles. The Dulles family God only knows has been accused of a lot of things, many of them true. No one ever accused them of being thieves however, the failure of the Bay of Pigs was enough reason for John F. Kennedy to demand Allen Dulles's resignation not some Swiss bank accounts.In contrast to Hurt look also for a small role from Joe Pesci as the Italian Mafia guy who's lost big bucks when Castro took over the hotels and casinos. As I write this, a whole lot of American companies are ready to move back into Havana once Fidel Castro no longer fogs a mirror. Only it won't be the Joe Pescis who will lead them.I don't know if anyone remembers, but shortly after 9/11 the U.S. government issued a clarion call for those who were gifted in Farsi, Arabic and all kinds of exotic languages. Just because the Cold War ended and the Soviet Union went out of business, didn't mean a happy ending. Our biggest intelligence failure was a basic one, the failure to perceive a new threat. We were still turning out experts in Russian and Chinese from our universities including the elite Ivy League ones like Yale. Only now are we turning out the experts needed for a new challenge. Again, playing catch up.Matt Damon's self contained performance and a talented cast in support are reasons to see The Good Shepherd. Don't take a short cut and write any term papers based on this film.",5,5,9,31 December 2006
Stalag 17," If Billy Wilder were making this today.
","Stalag 17 is my favorite Billy Wilder film. This is Wilder at the top of his cynical game. Not a frame of film is wasted in this movie and even the most minute performances shine.Of course the big prize here is the Oscar won by William Holden for Best Actor of 1953. In a recent biography of Wilder, I learned that Kirk Douglas was Wilder's original choice to play Sefton. Douglas wanted to do it and I'm sure would have been very good in the part, but he had prior commitments. So Wilder turned to Holden with whom he had done Sunset Boulevard and the results were sensational.While making the film, Holden grew to hate his character. He urged Wilder to do something to soften Sefton and Wilder refused. I think the results vindicate Wilder and Holden was the first to agree.Stalag 17 was a play set in only the barracks for the stage. To adapt it for the screen, Wilder created one character that was not in the original play, that of Cookie. Gil Stratton's performance blends so nicely in with the cast that that fact came as something of a surprise to me. Cookie is the offscreen narrator and it is through his eyes in which we see the action unfold.Wilder has such a marvelous sense of the absurd here. In Stalag 17 he created in my opinion one of the great absurd moments in film history. During the mail call scene Harvey Lembeck is getting a ton of letters and poor Bob Strauss is pining away that no one wrote to him. He questions Lembeck and he finds that all the letters were from a collection agency about his overdue payments on his Plymouth.Instead of love letters to 'Sugar Lips' Shapiro, the collection agency wants 'the third payment on the Plymouth, the fourth, the fifth, the sixth, they want the Plymouth.'I don't know about the rest of you, but the sublime absurdity of a collection agency tracking some soldier all the way to a POW camp in Germany for overdue car payments just cracks me up every time I see Stalag 17.Lembeck and Strauss were a great team together. Strauss was nominated for best Supporting Actor, but lost to Frank Sinatra.Lembeck has another favorite moment of mine in the film. The main plot is to discover who in the barracks is a stoolie. Almost at the end of the film when the stoolie is discovered, the stoolie tries to protest. Lembeck, who's been a comic character throughout the film, drops his voice down and just says 'he said to shut up.' There is such a chill in his voice it will frighten the audience. Again sublime film technique by a master.If Billy Wilder were making the film today some of the homoerotic overtones would be a lot more explicit. These men have not had any female companionship for a while and I'm sure some of the other prisoners would have started looking good. There's the Christmas dance in which poor Bob Strauss with some homemade hooch in him, starts dancing with Harvey Lembeck and thinking she's Betty Grable because Lembeck is in some impromptu drag. Also at the dance the blonde naive pretty kid Peterson played by Robert Shawley who you see being held rather tightly by one of the other prisoners. That was about as far as you could go back in 1953.In fact one of the reasons that Holden is hated so much by the rest of the barracks is that he's worked it out so he could consort with the Russian female prisoners in another part of the camp. The best thing the rest of them have in that barracks is Robert Shawley. He'd be a lot more explicitly gay by necessity or maybe even inclination today.Fellow director Otto Preminger is great as the camp commandant and Billy Wilder favorite Sig Ruman is Sergeant Schultz. But he's not your Hogan's Heroes Sergeant Schultz. In fact as the plot unfolds Ruman is not quite the buffoon as we are originally led to think. It's a very subtle piece of acting by Sig Ruman, probably the best performance in his career.In fact Stalag 17 is a wonderful ensemble gathering of great players performing a timeless story.",9,30,42,14 July 2005
The Blind Side," A helping hand
","The Blind Side is a most inspiring film about Michael Oher a gentle giant of a kid who's not gotten too many breaks in life. But all he needed was a helping hand and he gets one from country singer Tim McGraw and Sandra Bullock and now Michael Oher is one of the top defensive players of the National Football League.Quinton Aaron plays Oher and for most of the film he's pretty mute, almost catatonic answering in monosyllables. He's brought out of the Memphis ghetto by a man who would like to get him just off his couch. Aaron's mother is a crackhead and she's long abandoned him. McGraw is a football coach at a private Christian High School and Bullock is his wife. The story here is how Bullock proves to be the mother figure this young man needs badly in his life. He becomes a member of the family as much as her two natural children with McGraw are. As for Tim McGraw he shows some acting chops and holds his own with Bullock and the rest of the cast.Aaron is a catatonic gentle giant, big enough for defense on any team, but lacking in aggression. Best scene in the film is when Bullock teaches him the necessary aggression needed for that sport.Rivaling that is a voice over narration of a composition that Aaron writes interpreting The Charge Of The Light Brigade. Aaron in the voice over proves to be quite articulate and definitely not stupid as was thought by many. I'd give the paper an A.The Blind Side is a wonderful family film for which Sandra Bullock copped a Best Actress Oscar. The Blind Side was also in the running for Best Picture of 2009. Quite deservedly so.",7,1,2,17 April 2015
The Shawshank Redemption," 'I Had To Go To Prison To Learn To Be A Crook'
","None of the usual otherworld creatures that populate the works of Stephen King are to be found in The Shawshank Redemption. But the real world of that Maine prison has some bizarre rules of its own and there's a whole new reality within those walls.In the tradition of Cool Hand Luke and Birdman Of Alcatraz comes Tim Robbins who was a banker on the outside, but when he caught his wife cheating on him with a golf pro from their country club, he's convicted of putting eight bullets in them, four apiece and tried and sentenced to two consecutive life terms in Shawshank prison. Like Luke and Bob Stroud he works out his own rehabilitation and rebels against the prison system.He may be a con, but Robbins still has all his knowledge of finances and pretty soon he's made himself quite invaluable to the warden and the rest of the staff at the prison. At the same time he and the cell block scrounger Morgan Freeman develop a close personal relationship. In the end they beat the system in a most unique way.There have been some classic prison films made ever since The Big House at the dawn of the talkies. Two I've already mentioned. My favorite prison film is Robert Redford's Brubaker, but The Shawshank Redemption comes pretty close. As does The Green Mile which was also directed by Frank Darabont.Darabont got an Oscar nomination as did the film itself and as did Morgan Freeman for Best Actor. The Shawshank Redemption was in for a flock more Oscar nominations in 1994. A couple other good performances are that of James Whitmore the institutionalized con who is there for 50 years and paroled and just can't make it on the outside. He will break your heart as will Gil Bellows who plays a fresh, but rather likable young con who runs afoul of the warden.Speaking of which Bob Gunton as the warden will positively chill you with his corruption. You would have to go back all the way to the James Cagney classic, The Mayor Of Hell where Dudley Digges was the warden of boys reformatory to find a warden that is as sanctimonious and as corrupt as Gunton. This is a man who gives Bibles out to each inmate hoping that the reading of the Good Book will improve the moral fiber of the convicts. At the same time he's raking in money every which way he can and a rather special punishment is meted out to him by Robbins.The Shawshank Redemption may not have monsters and other worldly creatures that normally characterize a Stephen King story. But the world of Shawshank prison is bizarre enough for any normal person if you see this wonderfully crafted and acted film.",9,9,15,17 February 2011
The Cannonball Run," Cross Country drag race
","Before there were Police Academy movies there were these two Cannonball Run films where a whole lot of people did a movie with absolutely no story to it, but looked like they were having a lot of fun. If you could call it starring Burt Reynolds and long time pal Dom DeLuise because they have the most screen time.It's clear that this cast was enjoying all the overacting they were allowed to indulge in. Except possibly for Roger Moore who rather drolly underplayed his own image as an action hero, James Bond, the Saint, etc. Reynolds did too, to a lesser extent.You've got to love Dean Martin and Sammy Davis, Jr. as a pair of fake priests who copied Richard Nixon's dirty play book in their effort to win The Cannonball Run which when you come right down to it is just a cross country drag race. Reynolds and DeLuise are using an ambulance, the better to fool the Smokeys that they meet traveling west. And for insurance they have a kidnapped patient in Farrah Fawcett and one bat crazy doctor in Jack Elam. Between Elam and DeLuise I have to say it's a tossup as to who overacts the most.Like The Police Academy movies, the Cannonball Run films are dumb, witless, stupid, puerile, and you will laugh your derri√®re off.",6,1,1,23 January 2013
The Big Short," People Always Pay Their Mortgages
","The Big Short is a good if not entirely successful attempt to explain the economic collapse of the housing market. Banks lend money to people for mortgages, issue bonds based on the money that gets paid like clock work from hard working people who pay their mortgages to own their own home. I remember in the late 80s my mom paid off the final installment on a house my parents bought in 1955.But my parents weren't deadbeats and banks started getting looser and looser with easy credit. They began issuing what was called sub prime loans which is below the interest market rate. Those did go more and more to deadbeats and there's one great scene where a well proportioned woman tells us exactly what sub prime is and to run whenever you hear the words mentioned.Several people in the brokerage and the banking businesses got a scent of what was to happen to the various brokerage houses and the investment portfolios that had those bonds. People lost billions and that is no exaggeration. Like in the Stock Market crash of 1929 people saw that coming and sold out as well. A few got rich and even richer like Joseph P. Kennedy then. Most went bust.Some of the people who got the bad odor from the banks were people played by folks like Christian Bale, Steve Carrell, Ryan Gosling, John Magaro, Finn Wittrock, and Brad Pitt who was in the investing game and has an interesting role as one who is now living a modified hippie lifestyle. Magaro and Wittrock have their own small brokerage firm and Pitt gives them some sage advice.I liked Carrell the best because he has the best scenes in the film, when he personally investigates who some of those mortgages have been issued to. His scene with the stripper is priceless.It might help to have a business background, but The Big Short breaks it down for you as simply as possible. I might not have understood all the nuances, but I was entertained.",7,3,5,16 March 2016
Platoon," What a war
","The only military conflict that was in the American experience similar to Vietnam was the Phillipine Insurrection. I doubt that any of the characters whom Oliver Stone created for Platoon would even have known we were in a five year war in the Phillipines battling elements wanting independence after the Spanish-American War made the territory our's.This was a war without uniforms or battle lines. No one knew who was friend or foe. That bred callousness of an extreme kind into our troops. They learned to shoot first then fake a story for the official report. This is what we see in Platoon.Charlie Sheen is a newly arrived private in Vietnam and through him Oliver Stone the director/writer of Platoon tells the story of his war. He gets caught in a power struggle between Sergeants Willem Dafoe and Tom Berenger who are presented as good versus evil. Dafoe is a professional soldier who has managed to keep some semblance of humanity. Berenger has totally lost it. A Yin and Yang of personal valor.Other films like Casualties Of War and Apocalypse Now have given their Vietnam stories. I like Casualties Of War as a favorite Vietnam film of mine, but Platoon certainly has its merits. I think an awful lot who were there will say Platoon is the real deal.Some familiar people are scattered through the supporting cast. One that stands out is Matt's younger brother Kevin who plays a kind of Berenger in training. I doubt this kid from small town USA ever imagined himself doing the brutal things he does. He learned his lessons from Vietnam well and Berenger was a good teacher.Platoon got several Oscar nominations. Not my favorite Vietnam war film, but a very good one.",8,2,3,17 November 2016
Scream," Who's Doing All The Slashing?
","In the case of Scream my review should be taken with a grain of salt as I'm not really into these slasher flicks. But for its kind and the fact that it was directed by Wes Craven who does get the best out of them, it's as good as it will get.The film opens up with Drew Barrymore and her boyfriend being sliced and diced by some guy in a black cape and ghost mask. That's just to get the audience in the mood. It seems as though this slashing is connected to a case a year ago when Neve Campbell's mother was killed in the same grisly manner. This gives Neve a rooting interest to find out who is doing these killings.Two other people are interested in the story, TV reporter Courtney Cox and her then husband David Arquette playing a sheriff's deputy on the cases. But the killings go on and someone is after a lot of the town's teen population.Wes Craven borrowed a gambit from Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None for his story involving the real killer. If you know that film or the book Ten Little Indians from whence it comes, then you might just figure out who's doing all the slashing.Scream and its successors aren't exactly my cup of tea, but you might like this if that is your taste.",6,1,3,9 April 2012
Wonder Woman," Amazon power
","If you're liking special effects than this big screen version of Wonder Woman will fit your pistol. But for myself I much prefer what Lynda Carter did in the 70s on the small screen.I'm not even sure comic book purists will not have criticisms because this one takes Wonder Woman back to World War I. As we know she was created just before our entry into that second World War and her reason for leaving the Paradise Island home was to offer her services to the Allies most specifically against Mr. Hitler.In this one Steve Trevor played by Chris Pine washes ashore on the Amazonian populated Paradise Island and he's followed shortly by some invading Germans. Trevor is played by Chris Pine and he helps battle the invaders. Not without losses do the Amazons repel the Germans, they give a good account of themselves with spears and arrows, on horseback and on foot.Here Princess Diana the soon to be Wonder Woman decides to leave the island because the Greek God of war Ares is behind all the slaughter on the western front. A Deity that gets off on killing. That's who Israeli actress Gal Gadot playing Wonder Woman is after while Chris Pine has a more prosaic intelligence mission.Wonder Woman is a good action/adventure flick with the pyrotechnics fans crave, but I'll take Lynda Carter any old time.",5,1,11,6 November 2017
Paths of Glory," They Couldn't Take An Ant Hill
","Almost one hundred years later the concept of that static war of the trenches that was the Western front of World War I is almost unfathomable. After the French army stopped the German offensive at the Battle of the Marne, the French and British armies faced the Germans in a line of trenches that stretched from Belgium to Switzerland. About a quarter of France was occupied for four years in that time. The casualties ran into the millions in that stalemate that gains were only measured in meters.It was always just one more offensive over the top charging into automatic weapon fire that would break the other guy. Just such an offensive was planned one day in 1916 against a German stronghold dubbed the ant hill. General George MacReady, promised a promotion by his superior Adolphe Menjou, orders a beaten and tired battalion to charge the ant hill. The attack flops and MacReady looks for scapegoats. He decides after coming down from shooting 100 men to a selected three drawn by lot. The unlucky three are Joseph Turkel, Ralph Meeker, and Timothy Carey.The commander of the three Kirk Douglas asks to serve as their counsel and he makes a good show of it at the kangaroo court martial they have. But the fix is definitely in.Except for Spartacus, Kirk Douglas rarely plays straight up heroic types in film. Even his good guys have an edge to them, a dark side. But as Colonel Dax, Douglas is at his most heroic. He may be one dimensional here, but he's great. Especially in that last scene with Adolphe Menjou when he tells the man off in no uncertain terms, mainly because Menjou has misread Douglas's motives. Menjou and Macready portray two different military types. The arrogant MacReady as versus the very sly Menjou. Not very admirable either of them. Menjou was not very popular at this time in Hollywood because of the blacklist. He favored it very much, his politics were of the extreme right wing. Nevertheless he was a brilliant actor and never better than in this film, one of his last.The enlisted men are a good bunch also. They're kind of like the posse in The Oxbow Incident, just an ordinary group who become ennobled in martyrdom as they go to the firing squad for the sake of politics.Paths of Glory is one of the best anti-war films ever made. It ranks right up there with All Quiet on the Western Front which showed the war from the German point of view. Both will be classics 200, 300, a thousand years from now.",10,161,183,2 July 2006
The Queen," One week in the life of the Windsor Queen
","I remember I was visiting relatives when I heard about the death of Princess Diana
back in 1997. She was an international celebrity and something the royal family
had never had to deal with. Cast off wives were either locked up like George I's
queen and we know what happened to Henry VIII's wives.But Diana was different , her charity work as well as her international jetsetting kept her in the news. So when she died people truly mourned.And they wanted the Royals to mourn in the United Kingdom and show it. But
there was silence from the monarchy.Helen Mirren plays Elizabeth II and she considered this a private ceremony. But
the country loved Princess Diana, ex-member of the family or not. James Cromwell is Prince Philip, Alex Jennings is Prince Charles, and Michael Sheen is
Tony Blair, new in the job of Prime Minister and facing a constitutional crisis.The Queen got a few Oscar nominations and Helen Mirren won a Best Actress
Oscar. In this film you really do feel like you are peeking in on the British
Royal Family. When the monarchy is in danger they always do find a way of
saving it. It's an institution that depends on public relations and when public
opinion isn't good they have to work to make it good. As was done her.They don't have the options Henry VIII did back in his day.",9,1,1,16 December 2019
1408," 'I do believe in spooks, I do, I do, I do'
","This adaption of a Stephen King novel finds John Cusack as a writer specializing in debunking the occult and makes a pretty good living at it. He's informed about a room at the Dolphin Hotel on Lexington and East 45 Street in Manhattan, number 1408 which has an unusual number of deaths associated with it. You know he's got to check this one out.It's a Stephen King book so you know the rumors are going to be well founded. Most of the film involves John Cusack in that room 1408 all by himself dealing with an occult freak show. Needless to say, he's a believer by the end of the film.Cusack does a good job as the cynical writer who turns into a believer. If you listen faintly into the background you can just hear Bert Lahr saying, 'I do believe in spooks, I do, I do, I do.'If this kind of film is what you like than this film will be to your liking. Stephen King fans provide a loyal fan base so I expect the film to do well.",6,2,4,8 July 2007
Raging Bull," Brutal and Honest
","Since John Wayne and John Ford stopped making films, the greatest director/actor combination of the last 35 years is in my mind Martin Scorsese and Robert DeNiro. In Raging Bull these two guys are within their element. An added dimension to Scorsese's direction and DeNiro's portrayal is that these are the people they know and grew up with. Raging Bull invokes a world of the past that isn't always pleasant, but is brutal and honest.Jake LaMotta as middleweight champion of the world 1949-1951 may have had the hardest chin in boxing. He was a good puncher, but he had a marvelous ability to not only take a punch, but roll with it so it did less damage than thought. He fooled many an opponent like that and set them up for the kill.Large parts of the boxing establishment was controlled by organized crime back in his days, the fathers of the people you'd later see DeNiro play in Goodfellas. You had to play ball with them or you went nowhere in the fight game. Jake compromised himself by agreeing to throw a fight to someone named Billy Fox in order to get a title shot at the middleweight crown. It seared his very soul in doing that.One thing that wasn't covered in Raging Bull was the drama behind the title fight itself with Marcel Cerdan the man who LaMotta took the crown from. Cerdan was a national French hero, resistance fighter, lover of Edith Piaf and possessor of a murderous punch who had never been knocked out and only had sustained three losses in his career, two by disqualification. He was quite a brawler himself. Cerdan broke his elbow in the first round and for 10 rounds literally held LaMotta off with one hand. When he failed to answer the bell for the 11th round, LaMotta got the title on a TKO. He was immediately promised a rematch and was on his way to the USA for that rematch when he was killed in a plane crash in the Azores. His death set off a national period of mourning in France.LaMotta later admitted throwing the Fox fight to Congressional investigators and that with the win over the injured Cerdan cast a pall on his career and reputation. Sad because it was something he couldn't help. Jake the Bronx Bull certainly did have reason to rage. DeNiro is something special. Watching this film you really think you are peeking into a heavenly newsreel highlights and lowlights of the life and career of Jake LaMotta. This film should be seen back to back with Somebody Up There Likes Me, the Rocky Graziano story that Paul Newman brought to the screen. Covers roughly the same era with the same quality. Joe Pesci as DeNiro's manager/brother and Frank Vincent as the neighborhood wise guy would work together again and well with DeNiro and Scorsese. Cathy Moriarty gets her first notice as Jake's second wife Vicky who became a celebrity in her own right after Jake's boxing career was over.Raging Bull is one of the finest boxing films ever done by a master director assembling a perfect cast to tell the tale of a bygone era.",10,9,15,6 April 2006
Step Up," Eminem Meets Fame
","In looking over the reviews of Step Up I saw comparisons to Flashdance, Save the Last Dance for Me, and a few others. The pithy review that Step Up got in my hometown free paper Art Voice remarked that the film had some nerve to advertise it had an original screenplay. Personally I like to think of it as Eminem meets Fame. The only thing missing was Debbie Allen doing the choreography.Lead Channing Tatum in this film is a kind of an Eminem light. He's a kid being raised in a foster home in Baltimore and he's been busted for breaking in and trashing the Maryland School of Arts. As punishment he gets to do janitorial service at that same school. Channing's got some moves though and he hooks up with a girl from the right side of the tracks, Jenna Dewan, who needs a rehearsal partner. If you've seen all the films mentioned above you've got a pretty good idea what follows. If the film is hardly original, it doesn't mean that it's bad. Both the leads have some real moves on the dance floor and as Tatum regrettably remarked, he found out that dancing can indeed be like rocket science.",6,4,9,19 August 2006
The Silence of the Lambs," Getting A Good Consultant
","It seems as though there is a serial killer out there who's grabbed the daughter of a United States Senator and this guy has zoomed right to the top of FBI's Most wanted. This man's modus operandi is to keep the victims alive for a while before killing them so they're racing against time to find him. Desperate situations call for desperate measures.The desperate measure is, you want to catch a serial killer, bring in one as a consultant. That's why FBI trainee Jodie Foster goes to visit Anthony Hopkins in prison. Hopkins is not just a killer who eats his victims, he's a brilliant psychologist himself with insights maybe no one else has.Of course his price are some cheap insights into Jodie Foster's soul, thrills he probably got when he was in practice.The Silence of the Lambs in less capable hands could have just been another cheap slasher flick. Instead the leads who walked off with the Academy Awards for Best Actor and Best Actress give riveting performances of a sick twisted psycho and a woman who became the biggest feminist icon since Sigourney Weaver by confronting some demons of her own. It's the best work that Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster have ever done and let's not forget the Oscars won by Director Jonathan Demme and the Picture itself for being the Best in 1991.A couple of players who made their marks on television later on also score well here. Anthony Heald who was Buffy the Vampire Slayer's handler plays the psychiatrist in the institute where Hopkins is incarcerated and who Hopkins makes a fool of and says at the end he's far from done with. Also Ted Levine who is Captain Stottlemeyer on Monk plays the serial killer the FBI is trying to catch. Also look for a good performance by Brooke Smith as Levine's potential victim.The Silence of the Lambs with its taut direction and riveting performances has an appeal far beyond the horror genre. See it and you'll know what I mean.",9,5,11,3 August 2007
Vanilla Sky," The Lucid Dream Option
","Tom Cruise as David Aames has it all, as we used to say in my neighborhood by the short hairs of the scrotum in a more earthy manner. Unlimited wealth, good looks, what is there in the world to want for. He's got an occasional sex partner in Cameron Diaz, but a chance meeting in a bar with Penelope Cruz, tells him she's the one.But it's not to be after he gets into an automobile accident and becomes horribly disfigured. We're talking here about a man not used to having too many really bad life curves tossed at him. However with his wealth he can take an option not too many of us have. Cruise gets himself cryogenically frozen with a 150 year expiration date in the hope that science will develop the technology to fix his face. He even gets to dream with implanted images of the good times.Director Cameron Crowe used some old movie clips for things Cruise identified with in Vanilla Sky. The one that would have explained it all was from Forbidden Planet where Warren Stevens after he takes the Krel brain test, tells Leslie Nielsen that those Krel forgot all about the Id. It's that Id that keeps screwing up Tom's dream, turning it into a big old nightmare. Vanilla Sky is a good film, could have been a lot better for me if I had some warning of what was going on. The film is like a big budget remake in some ways of The Trial, that Kafka drama that starred Anthony Perkins and Orson Welles. Except Tom's trial was all in his mind.Tom's worldwide legion of fans should like it though.",6,3,6,13 November 2008
Black Panther," Wakanda
","Chadwick Boseman who played a pair of real live black icons and played them
well makes a reappearance as T'Changa whom we met in Captain American
Civil War. Jackie Robinson and Thurgood Marshall should only have had the
superpowers this guy has. Including a mysterious mineral that gives those who use it some real staying power. Kind of like kryptonite.With technological advances we can sure do more with these superheroes than
could have been done in Hollywood's golden era. But I think the real reason
these films are so popular is that real life isn't providing us with that many
heroes to admire. Sure easier to root for Marvel Comics creation.Anyway Boseman's father died and being the crown prince he's the logical
successor. But in the hidden kingdom of Wakanda you can get challenged.
Something like the way the Klingons choose their leader. Boseman defeats
one challenger, but another one, an exile raised in the mean streets of Oakland played by Michael B. Jordan emerges and he takes over for a bit.
Boseman is down, but not out.Kids and Trekkie types will certainly love this. Not my particular cup of tea,
but it's nicely done and packaged.The only question I have is that if these Wakandans are as powerful as they
are, why weren't the first Arab slave traders repelled let alone European buyers? Seems like that was the time to make their presence known.",6,9,17,22 February 2018
Any Given Sunday," The Business of Sports
","When Oliver Stone isn't flaunting wild conspiracy theories, he actually gets down to the business of making some really good films. And Any Given Sunday is definitely one of those.It's a difficult perspective for me to write about this movie as my favorite spectator sport is baseball rather than football. But the business end of it is virtually the same. Curiously enough I was in Miami last week and saw the Florida Marlins home opener. They are going through some of the same dealings with the Miami city fathers about a new stadium that you see Cameron Diaz having with Clifton Davis in this film. There's a possibility that Miami will not have its major league baseball franchise soon.Cameron Diaz is the young owner of the Miami Sharks professional football team who inherited it from her late father who is described as one of the prominent owners in the sport, a kind of combination of Wellington Mara and George Halas. Her father gave Coach Al Pacino complete latitude to deal with his players, but Cameron is taking George Steinbrenner as her role model.Al Pacino joins the ranks of players who have done outstanding portrayals of athletic coaches. It's an honorable tradition going back to Pat O'Brien as Knute Rockne. I'm not sure how Rockne would have done in the era of seven figure salaries, but Pacino is adapting the best way he can.When I was a kid in NYC in the fifties following our three major league baseball teams, one of the great constants was Casey Stengel winning that American League pennant for the New York Yankees with Yogi Berra behind the plate. The catcher's job is similar to the quarterback's in football in that he sees the whole game and actually sets the pace in calling the pitches. As Yogi's skills deteriorated over time, Casey could never quite pull the plug on him as the regular catcher. As a result, Elston Howard who would have been a regular on any other team never amassed the statistics that probably would have put him in the Hall of Fame.Pacino has that kind of dilemma here. A veteran quarterback in Dennis Quaid and an up and coming talent in Jamie Fox. Quaid's skills are deteriorating, but he has the heart of a warrior which Pacino tells him in my favorite moment in the film. And the lesson Fox learns from Pacino and Quaid is that if the team doesn't respect you, you don't lead winners. And winning is the bottom line. There are a whole lot of good performances here in minor roles, the hallmark of a great film. James Woods as the slimy team doctor, Ann-Margret as Cameron Diaz's mother, LL Cool J as a defensive lineman who may have taken one hit too many. And what a casting coup Oliver Stone pulled off in getting Charlton Heston for a small role as the football commissioner. Who better to run professional football than the guy who brought the Ten Commandments down from Mount Sinai.I think even non-sports fans can appreciate this film.",8,10,21,19 April 2006
Iron Man," Iron Man Eats His Spinach
","From what I can see of Iron Man, he's different from other superheroes in two respects. First he's quite the vulnerable one and second he's put together with extreme, but very human intelligence. Nobody came to Earth with powers and abilities far beyond mortal men. No one got their DNA mixed up with some animal to give them some extra-sapien traits. No Iron Man is put together in a laboratory after a prototype is done while in captivity in a cave.That's probably both the strength and weakness of this film. Robert Downey, Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow and most of all Jeff Bridges look like they're having a great old time putting flesh and bone on comic strip characters. I'm glad they enjoyed it, I didn't enjoy it as much as I normally do these kind of films.Iron Man is updated to today's world situation, but with some Thirties flashbacks because it's an arms dealer who is the chief villain here. Downey is like Bruce Wayne, a multimillionaire heir to an armaments fortune who likes to have a good time as well as work while Bridges minds the company day to day. But that MIT education did not go for naught as those Afghan terrorists found out. Downey proves as resourceful as B.A. Baracus of the A-Team in developing the Iron Man first to escape captors and then to defeat bad guys. And these bad guys are quite in league.But while the special effects are nice and the players are having a good time, Iron Man reminded me of a Popeye cartoon. Downey and Bridges looked Popeye and Bluto in the best two out of three falls. All that Downey needed to do was reach for that can of Spinach.I half expected he would.",5,6,16,19 May 2008
Tombstone," 'They Drag Me Back In Again'
","Kurt Russell as Wyatt Earp must have felt a whole lot like Michael Corleone being brought back into the law business which he thought he'd left behind in Kansas. Of course when you and your brothers settle in a wide open town like Tombstone, Arizona you've got to expect your talents will be called upon.As long as films are being made, filmmakers will never lose their fascination for the saga of Wyatt Earp that culminated in the famous gunfight at the OK Corral in 1881. Kurt Russell join an incredible pantheon of Hollywood's best actors who've gotten a crack at Wyatt Earp, like Henry Fonda, Randolph Scott, Joel McCrea, Burt Lancaster and Tom Mix. However this film bears the closest resemblance to Hour Of The Gun which had James Garner as Wyatt Earp which also showed, in fact it concentrated on what happened after the famous gunfight.Unlike in Hour Of The Gun where Jason Robards, Jr. as Doc Holliday upbraids Wyatt Earp for becoming a killing machine, nobody's really caring about that here. In fact the tubercular Holliday quite approves of what Russell is doing. He's given plenty of cause after the OK Corral as you'll see.When he's on the screen Val Kilmer steals the film. In fairness to Russell and the rest who've played Earp, especially as a straight arrow the way Burt Lancaster did Gunfight At The OK Corral, the role of Holliday is such a colorful one, it's an actor's dream. Kirk Douglas walked off with that picture as does Val Kilmer here and Russell isn't quite the straight arrow that Lancaster was.For the first time the Earp brothers are shown as the family men they were. All but Wyatt were married in fact and Wyatt was keeping company with Dana Wheeler-Nicholson, but he drops her for Dana Delany who in fact he was with for the rest of their lives together and Earp died in 1929.Robert Mitchum whose unmistakable voice narrates the film was supposed to play Old Man Clanton, but health considerations knocked him out of the part and he only narrated. I'm sure the rewriting also reduced the parts of Ike and Billy Clanton. Another film legend, Charlton Heston, plays rancher Henry Hooker who shelters Wyatt and his posse.The bad guys who get their due here are Powers Boothe as a vicious Curly Bill Brocius and Michael Biehn as Johnny Ringo who's definitely not gambling with the Earps and Doc Holliday with a full deck.My favorite Wyatt Earp film still remains Hour Of The Gun, but Tombstone which follows and embellishes a lot of the story line of that film is definitely a worthwhile film. I understand according to commentary made during a showing of this on the History Channel, Kurt Russell did a lot of the directing himself.He and credited director George P. Cosmatos deserve a lot of credit.",9,2,4,11 July 2009
The Greatest Showman," The art of promotion
","It's ironic that this musical celebration of the life of Phineas Taylor Barnum comes
out just when the last tangible legacy of his life comes to an end. The plot of
The Greatest Showman ends just when Barnum gets the idea that he just needs
a large tent to house his attractions. We never see Barnum&Bailey's circus come
to fruition, we never even meet James P. Bailey in this film.. Their circus merged
with that of the Ringling family and it was Ringling Brothers&Barnum&Bailey
circus that traveled the world for over a century. Last year the troupe finally
broke up as the circus became an institution confined to history. Still Phineas
Taylor Barnum is still a name that set a standard for promotion.The Greatest Showman looks a whole lot like in style and substance with the
Cole Porter tribute film It's DeLovely. But that film had a library of a song catalog to score that film from its subject. Benj Pasek and Justin Paul wrote the songs for The Greatest Showman and This Is Me gained an Oscar nomination for Best Song, one of the very few now written for that rarest of
film lately, the original screen musical.A lot of people have brought P.T. Barnum to the screen and Hugh Jackman in 
his performance joins such folks as Wallace Beery, Burt Lancaster, and Michael
Crawford among others. Jackman doesn't take a back seat to any of these.
Two refugees from the Disney Studio, Zac Efron and Zendaya have great parts
to exhibit their musical talents. Rebecca Ferguson plays The Swedish Nightingale Jenny Lind who represented Barnum's successful bid for respectability. She has a nice song to sing dubbed by Loren Allred in Never 
Enough. But it might have been wiser and more accurate to have gotten some
soprano to sing a familiar public domain aria instead. What you see here is
most definitely not an authentic Jenny Lind.There's no more Scudder's Museum where Barnum exhibited his sideshow acts.
Jenny Lind arrived too soon for her voice to be captured on Mr. Edison's new
phonograph, and now the circus is of the past. But The Greatest Showman is
still quite a tribute to the one who really invented the concept of show business, P.T. Barnum.",8,2,5,13 May 2018
Ben-Hur," A 'Real' Character
","General Lew Wallace, a somewhat controversial commander of the Union forces in the Civil War happened to be on a train with Robert Ingersoll, noted atheist in the 19th century. Wallace was a moderately religious man and attempted to debate Ingersoll. The story has it that Ingersoll whipped him to a frazzle and Wallace knew it. But he resolved to study the Bible and learn about his faith so that he would be better prepared.He never got to debate Ingersoll again, but Wallace got so immersed in religion that he decided to put that knowledge to use. While he was Territorial Governor of New Mexico and while he wasn't dealing with the Lincoln County War and the hunting down of Billy the Kid, he spent his spare time creating what became the widest selling work of fiction in his century, Ben-Hur, A Tale of the Christ.He did his research well. Judah Ben-Hur and his mother and sister are descended from a very ancient family of Hebrew nobility. The founder of this house was Hur who in the Bible was the husband of Miriam who was Moses's sister. Hur pops up as a peripheral character during the whole story of the Exodus. He invested the characters that Charlton Heston, Martha Scott, and Cathy O'Donnell play with a heroic lineage which makes their fall all the more tragic.So on the consciousness of the public were the Hur family that one often thinks of them as real people. Case in point, many years ago a teacher of mine wanted to demonstrate how many true characters Charlton Heston played on the screen. I count 15 in his list of credits on IMDb, some he's played in more than one film or television show. Inevitably more than just one person named Ben-Hur as a real character. A tribute to the timelessness of the character and to Charlton Heston's abilities as actor.The story is that Heston and his family greet an old friend newly arrived back in Judea province, Messala who is now a tribune. Messala played by Stephen Boyd, is one ambitious fellow and he wants Heston to rat out potential leaders of rebellion in this most unruly of Roman provinces. Heston refuses.The next day Boyd frames an incident where a piece of old tile accidentally falls from the Hur family home while the new Judean governor is passing by into an assassination attempt. Scott and O'Donnell are thrown in prison and Heston is sentenced to the galleys. The story is then Ben-Hur's adventures in trying to get back to Judea and set things right.Ben-Hur meets a whole host of people who aid him in his endeavor. Jack Hawkins as a commander of the galley fleet he's serving on, Finlay Currie as Balthazar one of the Three Wise Men now seeking the child whose birth he witnessed in the year Anno Domini, Hugh Griffith as Sheik Ilderim whose horses Ben-Hur races.It's not often mentioned, but among the Oscars collected for this most honored film, besides the ones that the film itself, Wyler, and Heston won, was Hugh Griffith's for Best Supporting Actor. His Arab sheik is a blustering, but very wise and compassionate fellow. The events of this film are taking place some six centuries before the Prophet Mohammed arrived on the scene. The Arab people at that time were involved in a hedonistic animist kind of religion, but it's left up in the air that they might turn Christian. Certainly some of them did and some are Christian to this day as the country of Lebanon attests.Griffith had the wildest pair of eyes in film history next to Jack Elam's and he used them to great effect. Watch his expressions during the film, they're what got him the Oscar.Stephen Boyd also got rave notices for the evil Messala. When he's not stepping on people to move up in Roman politics, Messala likes to race chariots. During his odyssey Ben-Hur becomes a charioteer and the climax of the film is the thrilling chariot race that turns into a race for survival. You'll see in the film, Messala doesn't exactly play by Marquis of Queensbury rules for charioteers. Boyd did some leads after Ben-Hur, but never really took as a hero. But he was one grand villain.While Ben-Hur is a prisoner being led to the galleys the Roman prison convoy stops in a town called Nazareth and a carpenter faces down a Roman guard to give the thirsting Ben-Hur a drink of water. The two men go their separate ways, Ben-Hur's is described in the book by Lew Wallace, the carpenter's way in the first four books of the New Testament. Later on after Ben-Hur discovers his mother and sister and what's become of them, they hear about Jesus of Nazareth, a rabbi with a message of hope and reputation for miracles. Of course when they seek Jesus it's when He's just been tried and condemned and on the way to the cross. It's now Ben-Hur's turn to offer the carpenter a drink of water on the way, to show his trust and faith. And as the sky darkens and Jesus breathes his last, the film depicts what the New Testament describes as the blackest day in Earth's history. But even at that point Heston's new found faith is rewarded, a miracle at the point of death. What was the miracle, for that you buy the DVD or wait until Ben-Hur is on television.Ben-Hur should really be seen in a theater, even a letter box version doesn't do justice to the chariot race or the sea battle with pirates.Ben-Hur is the story of two paths, one of vengeance and one of faith. Our protagonist tries his way and in the end realizes the path of faith is the more rewarding.",10,13,25,16 April 2006
Bull Durham," Doing her bit for the national past time
","Bull Durham only received Oscar recognition in one category that of Original Screenplay. But that screenplay is the basis of the film that broke the mold for baseball films.When you think of baseball films you think of heroic type films like the biographical stories of Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Grover Cleveland Alexander and Monty Stratton. Or some funny, but still reverential films like Kill The Umpire or It Happens Every Spring. None of these films will ever have a character like Susan Sarandon, a well known baseball Annie which is what the players have dubbed their groupies. You could never have a character like her with the infamous Code in place. Sarandon is frank, she loves sex, she loves baseball and she sees herself doing her bit for the national past time. Her concentration this year is on Tim Robins who is a promising Sandy Koufax like pitcher before Sandy got control of his pitching and gave us five of the best seasons ever seen before announcing his premature retirement.Also giving Robins his concentration is veteran catcher Kevin Costner hired specifically for that purpose by the Raleigh-Durham Bulls. Between Sarandon and Costner they turn Robins into someone fulfilling his promise. But baseball is a most unsentimental game as Costner knows and Sarandon's avocation is also one with some heartbreak.Best scene in the film is Costner describing what it's like in the Major Leagues, 'the big show'. As he says 'the 20 best days in my life'. Like actors, athletes on team sports want to play in whatever major leagues there are. If not they're like Costner, hanging on because of the love of the game.Costner has the philosophy of Stan Musial who was quoted as saying he knew it was time to quit because the pain outweighed the fun of getting paid to play a sport. I suspect that Musial would have felt the same had he been a journeyman player like Costner rather than the Hall Of Famer he is.No way that Christian athlete William O'Leary would have been a character in a film made under the Code auspices. Younger groupie Jenny Robertson makes a point of showing him what he's missing.Ron Shelton who was a minor league ballplayer drew from some rich memories of those times to give us Bull Durham. It's both a serious and also irreverently funny look at those who participate in our national past time and the women who service them.",9,0,0,17 August 2015
Signs," Seeing The Small Picture
","During the course of the film Joaquin Phoenix's character remarks that the situation they're in seems like The War Of The Worlds. It certainly is, but the small picture of it.Whereas H.G. Wells wrote on the grand scale about what nations and governments were doing to fight an alien invasion, M. Night Shyamalan's Signs concerns itself with the small picture, what is happening in one tiny corner of the world, to be precise Bucks County, Pennsylvania and very specifically Mel Gibson and his family.One day farmer Gibson who used to be a minister woke up and found that his cornfield had been systematically decimated and a precise geographical pattern was laid out that could be seen from the air. He concluded it was some kind of prank which would have been the normal reaction of anyone. But when reports of the world wide similar crop defilings and then sitings of shadowy alien figures than the world is in a crisis mode.But the world is on the back-burner for Gibson. He was a clergyman but gave it up after the death of his wife who was hit by a drunk driver. He's got his own issues to deal with if he can get himself, his children Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin and brother Joaquin Phoenix through the ordeal. All this without knowing how the world in general is coping. Gibson and the family can only speculate and that's where imaginations run wild.I have to say that Mel Gibson does a thoroughly good job as an everyman caught up in a global crisis. When War Of The Words was made by George Pal in the Fifties, the leads Gene Barry and Ann Robinson were scientists who had vital information for the survival of the world. The globe is still at risk in Signs, but Mel and his family can't worry about that, just in keeping themselves alive.Signs is thinking science fiction ranking up there with the best work of Ray Bradbury and John Heinlein. It's both entertaining and engrossing, you can't ask for more from a film.",8,7,14,27 November 2009
The Deer Hunter," One Shot
","I can identify a lot with The Deer Hunter because my mother's family were of Ukranian background and my relatives on her side were a whole lot like the people we see here from Clairton, Pennsylvania. They worked in the same factory jobs that these men do and answered the call of their country at war, but in a whole different time. And the grandson of one my uncles recently served in Iraq as a marine.Make no mistake about it, these people for all their personal faults are the backbone of America. They are the folks whose blood gets spilled in the wars we fight. So when they are called it had better not be in an unrighteous or fruitless cause.Robert DeNiro, Christopher Walken, and John Savage are three mill workers from small town Clairton, Pennsylvania. All from Slavic background as my family is and in a time when those of us more educated and more sophisticated and knowing better dodge the draft, these guys enlist and go to Vietnam. The Deer Hunter is about the effects of that war on all of them and all around them.John Savage gets overlooked a lot with both Robert DeNiro being nominated for Best Actor and Christopher Walken winning for Best Supporting Actor, but Savage is the guy most physically damaged, losing a leg as a result of the escape all three make from a Viet Cong prison. He's growing quite accustomed to what he calls the country club of the VA hospital he's in and can't bring himself to come home.Robert DeNiro is a hunter on weekends, as were some in my family. But the sure marksman from before Vietnam, after having to kill people to stay alive, is not about killing defenseless deer any longer. Meryl Streep plays the woman who loves both DeNiro and Walken and she's so totally immersed in her role and her role's ethnic background, I could swear she was one of my relatives.Christopher Walken will blow you away with his performance of the man totally unhinged by his capture with the Viet Cong and the Russian Roulette games they play with the captives. His final confrontation with DeNiro will move you beyond words.Michael Cimino who directed and co-wrote the screenplay got an Oscar for the film and himself and deserved every bit of it. Acclaimed the new genius of the cinema, his next project proved to be an overblown disaster, Heaven's Gate. Not that that film was as bad as it was made out to be, but Cimino's career plummeted and never really got back on track.28 years later I remember the Oscar ceremonies in 1979 when a dying John Wayne presented the Best Picture Oscar for The Deer Hunter. Ironic also because one of the cast member, John Cazale who played one of the friends in Clairton and best remembered for being Freddo Corleone in The Godfather also was dying of cancer while the film was being shot.Although I find it a bit too coincidental that three men from the same small town who join the Army would have the exact same service record, The Deer Hunter isn't really about the Vietnam War. It's about war and what it can do those that serve and to those around them.And this review is dedicated to those that serve.",9,4,9,12 December 2007
The Producers," Bialystock&Bloom
","After seeing the musical remake of The Producers it made me appreciate the original all the more. Not even the creator himself Mel Brooks who did the remake as well should have touched the original. You just can't improve on perfection.Poor Zero Mostel as Max Bialystock once noted Broadway producer, but now the genius behind several flop shows. When things can't get any worse he's about to be audited when drone little accountant Leo Bloom shows up in his office and starts going over the books. If this had been a Looney Toons cartoon the light bulb would have been over Mostel's head and flashing as Gene Wilder as Bloom explains how with a little creative accounting one can make lots of money off a flop show. Then it's off to go out and try to create the biggest flop in the history of Broadway. Something no one has ever actually tried for in the history of the theater itself.Certain films are seminal moments in the history of the genre. In comedy two previous ones in my opinion could be It Happened One Night and Some Like It Hot. Both by creative geniuses Frank Capra and Billy Wilder and both radically different films. Mel Brooks put himself in that category with The Producers. And like another genius David O. Selznick spent the rest of his career producing good film, even great ones but never topped his first and best.All I can say is that when the film opens with that Springtime For Hitler number done in Busby Berkeley style you'll react like Brooks's theater audience did and say he succeeded. But if The Producers teaches us anything it is that flops are born, not made.Brooks put together a perfect cast in support of Mostel and Wilder. Standing out are Dick Shawn as the method acting Hitler, Kenneth Mars as the crazy Naxi author, and Christopher Hewett as the worst director on Broadway who takes a real liking to Wilder.The Producers got an Oscar nomination for Gene Wilder as Best Supporting Actor. It won an Oscar for Mel Brooks for Best Original Screenplay.All I can say is that if ever an award was deserved it was the Oscar Mel Brooks got. It was certainly original.",10,1,3,14 June 2016
Cinderella," 'The thing-a-ma-bob that does the job is bibidi bobidi boo'
","Not the best of Walt Disney's feature length animated films, but any film that has Bibidi Bobbidi Boo and A Dream Is A Wish Your Heart Makes has to rate as good in anyone's standards.I saw this for the first time as a small child on Walt Disney's Disneyland hour and it was as effective on the big screen as well as the small. I don't think there's anyone who is literate in the western world who does not know the story of Cinderella. The story is intact and kept in the mythical medieval times it was written for.As a subplot to the main story we have the story of Cinderella and her relationship with the animals around the house. The pecking order is dog, cat, mice with a horse thrown in for good measure. Naturally the evil stepmother who is voiced by Eleanor Audley has the cat as her favorite. What does that say about us cat lovers.Ilene Woods voices and sings A Dream Is A Wish Your Heart Makes which Perry Como made a big hit record of. Bibidi Bobidi Boo is sung by Verna Felton who voices the Fairy Godmother. She's unforgettable in this role although she's better known as Hilda Crocker, Spring Byington's Ethel Mertz on December Bride. This is one eternal film that I hope my niece let's my new grandnephew check out and his sister or brother to be.",7,6,6,8 September 2013
RED," Black Ops Comedy
","Like Michael Corleone, Bruce Willis is out and they drag him back in, but this isn't business. Someone has got a black ops operation on some retired black ops operators. Enough to make anyone see Red.It's quite a reunion Willis has as he starts looking around and sees that a lot of former colleagues are meeting sudden demises. He gets to a few of them like Morgan Freeman, Helen Mirren, and John Malkovich and he even gets a Russian consultant in former KGB agent Brian Cox. When they're not reminiscing about old times, Cox does help point them in the right direction. Red must have taken some inspiration from the two Over The Hill gang movies from the Sixties. Without the western setting and those colorful western character actors, Red gets quite a few laughs in mostly from John Malkovich. He's easily the best performance in Red, playing a paranoid survivalist who has learned to be paranoid, it does keep the group alive or most of them in this film.Willis has perfected a nice dead pan comic style in his performance. Although I really can't see what Mary Louise Parker, the young woman working at Social Security who gets involved with Willis and then enmeshed in their counter ops operation.What's this all about, let's just say that it's coming from the highest or nearly the highest level possible. Someone doesn't want a lot of people around to tell tales. And at the end of the film I'd love to know how the government covers up what happens in the climax.93 year old Ernest Borgnine is trying to surpass John Gielgud's record of still acting when he was 97 has a small, but important role as the record keeper in the underground vault of the Central Intelligence Agency. Talk about knowing where all the bodies are buried. Ernie looks remarkable for his age and this is not his last project.Try to catch Red, it's stylish paranoia to be sure.",8,3,3,3 November 2010
Flight," The film's a 7, but Denzel Washington is a 10
","Denzel Washington's portrayal of a very flawed hero pilot which got him an Academy Award nomination in 2012 dominates the film Flight. All of his loved ones and all of his friends won't be able to help him with the jackpot he has himself in.Denzel is an airline pilot who on a routine Flight from Tampa Bay to Atlanta encounters turbulence in the air and mechanical failure. He does a heroic job in bringing the plane in at all. Everyone agrees that most other pilots would have crashed with all on board dead. When he crash lands in a field only six fatalities occur. There are several injured however including our hero pilot.But when he comes to in the hospital his toxic readings show traces of alcohol and cocaine. As we see later in the film he gets himself drunk and has developed a patented way of sobering up with a cocaine stimulant. Talk about living on the edge.The whole airline industry from the pilots union to the airline to the FAA don't know what to do. Washington is a hero for what he did, but that addiction can't be hid. And he persists in his bad behavior.This is one of the more complex portrayals of a character I've ever seen Washington do. In The Hurricane he's a hero who's been terribly unjustly wronged. In Training Day he gradually is revealed to be evil and corrupt. But here you don't know what to think. No doubt he's a hero, but he's also selfish and indulgent and can't even keep himself straight enough to get through a hearing on the crash. His own lawyer Don Cheadle is at his wit's end. Melissa Leo has an interesting part as the hearing officer at the FAA, she's got a grain of toughness, but even she would like to give him the benefit of the doubt. But besides Washington, the one you will remember is John Goodman who has two memorable scenes as his drug connection for his cocaine cure.The film Flight is a good one. But Denzel Washington might have picked up a third Oscar but for Daniel Day Lewis's Lincoln. He got more out of his role than most actors would have.",7,1,5,13 March 2013
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Hogwarts Kids Are True To Their School
","Watching Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows, Part 2 put me in mind of the old Beach Boys song about Be True To Your School. What these kids go through for the Alma Mater is definitely above and beyond for most of us, but all in a day's work for young wizards.At the end of Part 1, there's been a hostile takeover at Hogwarts Academy with perennial villain Alan Rickman the new headmaster. Michael Gambon has been killed and Daniel Radcliffe as protagonist Harry Potter along with two trusty sidekicks Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are in exile and seeking a way for an academic counterrevolution. That they succeed can be told to you by any of the millions of readers of J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series, but with a lot of interesting plot twists in which young Radcliffe learns a lot about himself and the very definite purpose he's been put on earth for.Though with the huge readership worldwide that the Harry Potter books enjoy, the only real criticism I can level at this or at most of the other films is that you really have to be immersed in Potter lore to know exactly what's going on. And that's bad if you missed a couple of the films when they were out as I did and still haven't made them up as yet.J.K. Rowling ended her series and this should end the series with public acclaim intact and fan base satisfied. For myself even with some problems following it every now and then I enjoyed this and the other films of the series. Harry Potter is a real hero who doesn't use just magic, but uses his head to get out of troublesome situations. Poor Daniel Radcliffe though, he'll be lucky if he ever gets another role like this one.",8,0,1,20 July 2011
Unbroken," Endure the unendurable
","By any stretch of the imagination Louis Zamperini was a hero and role model in any number of ways. In getting to see a rough cut of Angelina Jolie's film before he died, he got to see how millions and millions unborn will get to see his life. I think that's something you can't ask for more.If it wasn't for what Jesse Owens did in the 1936 Olympics Zamperini's story would be more well known even before Unbroken came out. A kid who had a lot of trouble with the law as a juvenile delinquent and a kid whose family was the only one of Italian origin from his small town of Torrance, California he felt the pangs of discrimination. A wise older brother told him to find an outlet and channel his energies into more constructive ways. Track and field became his outlet and in his time he became a legend, sad to say for posterity eclipsed by that other legend of Jesse Owens and the gold he won at Hitler's show palace in Berlin.He was training for the upcoming Olympics scheduled for Tokyo in 1940 when the World War broke out putting a lot of things in the world on hold. In the Armed Services Zamperini became a gunner in the Army Air Corps and got shot down and with two others one of whom died he was on a life raft for over a month. Rescue comes in the form of the Japanese and he and his fellow survivor spend a couple of years as Japanese prisoners and their treatment of captives was legendarily sadistic. His own strength of character permitted him to endure the unendurable. And he got to see Tokyo from an interesting point of view.I have to say that I did not recognize most of the players in Unbroken, but probably that was better because it became more authentic. Jack O'Connell plays Zamperini and Garrett Hedlund plays his fellow survivor from the plane and the prison. Takamasha Ishihara plays one of the prison camp officers who singles out Zamperini for some special treatment. He is chillingly evil.O'Connell and Hedlund are effective in their portrayals as well. Without star baggage which he will now have O'Connell makes you think you really are looking into the most triumphant and despairing moments of the life of Louis Zamperini. Angelina Jolie triumphs as a director as well. I have a feeling that she wanted to make an inspirational movie for the family she and Brad Pitt have to see.The vistas of Australia and the blue Pacific Ocean surrounding it was a great location and responsible for the Oscar nomination Unbroken got for cinematography. Unbroken also was given recognition by the Academy with two other nominations in the Sound department.Add a Coen brothers inspirational script and story and you have the makings of a fine film tribute for a real hero.",8,4,8,27 March 2015
Final Destination," You Don't Cheat The Grim Reaper
","Final Destination which spawned a veritable cottage industry of sequels like Rocky had a certain popularity among the young who really seem to have a terribly negative view of life. When young Devon Sawa has a creepy premonition and gets himself thrown off a plane bound for Paris in a class trip, a few others of his classmates and one teacher get thrown off with him.They all see in real life exactly what Sawa saw in his vision and they count themselves horrified at seeing friends and classmates die in a spectacular way as the plane exploded. They count themselves lucky at first, but then some mysterious force best articulated by Tony Todd says that Death is a character like any other and it's got a mean disposition. There is a plan of leaving this mortal coil in a specific order and you dare not disrupt the order.After which the rest start dropping in a series of bizarre situations and this has been the secret of the success of Final Destination and its sequels. And the deaths are properly gory and spectacular as well.For this kind of film of which I'm not a particular fan, Final Destination is as good as it gets.",5,1,2,30 January 2012
Rear Window," Enforced Idleness
","Alfred Hitchcock's second film with James Stewart is the story of Stewart's enforced idleness due to a broken leg. He's an active man, a news photographer, who constantly pushes himself into dangerous situations to get a picture and got a broken leg incidentally. Idleness for him is sure torture.Fortunately or unfortunately as things turn out he has a Greenwich Village apartment with a Rear Window that allows him to look on the neighbors across the courtyard. It's like watching about 15 different soap operas at once. And with his photographic equipment including a zoom telephoto lens, Stewart gets himself involved with the various soap opera plots.Stewart also has a girl friend in Grace Kelly who is playing a part that is really no stretch for her, a Park Avenue chic and rich woman who's really had quite a life of comfort. Stewart doesn't think she's ready for his kind of life and they have a running quarrel.That is until Stewart puts some conclusions together from observing one of the apartments and he thinks that salesman Raymond Burr has killed his wife. Although he can't convince his detective friend Wendell Corey, he does slowly convince Grace Kelly and Thelma Ritter his nurse of the validity of his conclusions.Everyone here does a creditable job, but I think the best performance comes from Raymond Burr. Burr, who played a lot of villains on the screen, usually plays them tough and mean. Hitchcock did a superb job in getting a performance of a really frightened man. Seeing the story of Burr and his wife through Stewart's eyes, it's the story of two very ordinary people apparently mismatched. Up until the last 15 minutes of Rear Window, we see Burr at a distance like the rest of Stewart's soap operas. When we do see him up close we find a very ordinary, but frightened man. It's his very ordinariness that makes Burr so frightening. The audience sees themselves in him, could we commit murder if sufficiently pushed hard enough?I suppose if James Stewart had a broken leg in 2005 and was laid up that way, he'd be busy on his personal computer and wouldn't have time to be looking across the courtyard. Televisions were still a luxury item in 2005. My grandparents still didn't have one at that date. Today Stewart could get all the afternoon soap opera action he wanted.A remake of Rear Window was done in 1998 with Christopher Reeve. Of course the difference is that Reeve was a paraplegic and dealing with a real and permanent situation on film and in his life. It was a whole new kind of Rear Window.Rear Window has all the elements one expects from Hitchcock, thrilling plot, witty and sophisticated dialog and a wry conclusion to it all. A very enjoyable film.",9,7,13,30 December 2005
Looper," Speculative enterprise
","When one deals with time travel as the process has not been discovered everything written or filmed about is always speculative. For instance the Jean-Claude Van Damme film Time Cop shows something quite different when we meet our future and past selves as Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis do here in Looper.Instead of the forces of law and latent fascism getting control of time travel in Time Cop, Looper has organized crime doing it and eliminating problems that Robert DeNiro in Casino remarked are usually swallowed up by the Nevada desert. Levitt is a Looper one who travels ahead to the future, specifically trained as an assassin and then goes back to his present origin and as targets come through a time portal, they get eliminated. Then at some point, the future selves are eliminated and the present selves just go on with normal lives as we define normal.Bruce Willis is Levitt's future self only he doesn't like the idea of elimination. And the big boss Jeff Daniels doesn't like how Levitt screwed up the elimination of Willis. The chase is on.Another question answered by Laurence Olivier in The Boys From Brazil said that we should not eliminate a cloned Hitler. Here a telekinesis gene has entered our gene pool and someone in the distant future has been harnessing its full potential to battle organized crime. That's an even bigger mission that the Levitt/Willis problem.Looper is a nice and original take on time travel with an outstanding cast giving some standout performances. Note particularly Emily Blunt as the mother of young Pierce Gagnon who has powers and abilities far beyond those of other mortal beings. And young Gagnon is something to see as well.Looper is definitely worth the price of admission.",8,2,13,2 October 2012
Casino," How Others See Us
","Casino is my favorite movie of the last decade of the last century. Just like in Goodfellas, Martin Scorsese rivets the audience to their seats without a real hero to root for. It's the power of the characters he creates.Robert DeNiro as the gambler boss of the Tangiers casino in Las Vegas of the 70s and 80s and Joe Pesci gangster are long time boyhood pals from the mean streets of Brooklyn. Both move out to Las Vegas seeking their respective places in their related fields at the orders of the higher ups in the criminal world. But circumstance drives them apart and one of those circumstances is Sharon Stone.People descending into degradation is always a role that will get you noticed by the Academy. Sharon Stone's part as Ginger is no exception here. She's a high price call girl when we first meet her and her descent into drug addiction isn't pretty, but Scorsese keeps it very real.But the main story line involves DeNiro and Pesci. To see ourselves as others see us is one elusive goal not attained by many in this world. These two aren't an exception. Each can see how the other is screwing up and absolutely cannot see what he's doing.The key scene in the whole film is when DeNiro and Pesci meet in the desert where a lot of problems have been known to disappear. If you can get passed all the cursing which is how you would expect gangsters to talk, each is making very realistic assessments about the other one and neither is listening to a word the other is saying. This is why I love Casino so much. I've never seen that particular theme ever handled so well on the screen.",10,12,19,5 August 2005
Heat," The Summit
","One of the amazing things about Heat is that during an almost three hour running time of the film, your interest in what happens in the summit teaming of Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro never flags for a second. Part of the reason is because these guys are at the top of their profession and brought their A game to the parts. The roles they have are not as good as Jake LaMotta, Jimmy Conway, or Max Cady for DeNiro or Frank Serpico, Michael Corleone, or Bobby Deefield for Pacino. But Neil McCauley master criminal for DeNiro and Jake Hanna dogged detective for Pacino does show these guys at their best.You can best describe Heat as a long running version of Law and Order Criminal Intent with a big budget. Like that show the action shifts back from the cops to the criminals and smoothly for director/writer Michael Mann. We see both of these guys as rather similar to each other. DeNiro prides himself on the fact that he says he can drop any relationship if it interferes with work. And Pacino is on his third marriage and his mistress is the job. He's been a failure twice as a husband and about to go thrice in the romance department.Mann gave Pacino and DeNiro a really outstanding cast for support in Heat. People like Val Kilmer are in DeNiro's gang, Jon Voight is the Sam Jaffe like mastermind of the operation. Pacino on his team has Mykel T. Williamson from Forrest Gump and Ted Levine best known as Captain Stottlemyre on Monk.This action film also does not stint on woman's roles. Diane Venora is fine as Pacino's estranged wife. Amy Breneman is also good as DeNiro's woman who watches her man helplessly trapped by his own criminal rules go to his destruction. Best in the film on the distaff side is Ashley Judd as Val Kilmer's loyal wife who has one great choice given her by Williamson, betray her husband or lose their kid. See how she handles it.Although the scene was shoehorned into the plot and would never happen in real life, Pacino and DeNiro do meet and have a brief scene together over a cup of coffee in a diner. They compare notes so to speak and take the measure of the other guy. Since these two guys are the most acclaimed actors of their generation, the scene artificial though it is takes on a whole different dimension. It's like when writers give Queen Elizabeth and Mary Queen of Scots a climatic meeting scene even though in real life it never happened.But like in Heat, it should have happened.",9,3,5,4 November 2008
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," In A Galaxy Far Away................A Franchise Was Born
","The awesome special effects and the creation of creatures that are part of the vivid imagination of George Lucas are not the reason for the enduring popularity of Star Wars and the franchise it spawned. Rather it is because of the characters Lucas created that will live as long as we have cinema and the means to display it.The spectacle is behind some real, but simple people. No shadings of gray in the first Star Wars we know without any doubt who the heroes and villains are of this piece. On an isolated planet a galaxy wide dictatorship called the Empire and the revolt against come to wear young Luke Skywalker as played by Mark Hamill and his family reside. So does Alec Guinness, a reclusive and mysterious hermit. An escape pod crashes there with two androids, C3PO and R2D2 and in the latter is a message for Guinness who was at one time a Jedi Knight, fiercest of a warrior class, from Carrie Fisher playing Princess Leia. Also in R2D2 are the schematics for the Empire's ultimate weapon the satellite size death star that can deal killing out on a planetary scale. This starts an adventure with young Hamill who teams up with futuristic soldier of fortune Harrison Ford as Han Solo and his simian like sidekick Chewbacca to rescue the Princess and defeat the Death Star.Those are the good guys. The bad guys are the blackest of black villainy. Peter Cushing cold bloodedly commands the Death Star, but the mysterious Darth Vader, clad in black with a helmet completely covering his head, has mysterious powers and even his superiors are wary of him. The voice of James Earl Jones is unforgettable as the black prince of the galaxy.These are characters that bring out the kid in all of us. The ones who claim the most sophistication in their lives will cheer on for Hamill and Ford and will be fascinated by the double dyed villainy of Darth Vader.Perhaps the most interesting aspect of Star Wars and I speak now of all the films is the way such non-humans as the robots and Chewbacca the Wookie became characters. C3PO had dialog, but R2D2 had a few clicks and bleeks and all Chewbacca did was grunt, still they became as identifiable as the human characters.Star Wars set the standard for science fiction films to come for the next several generations. It was given six Oscars in a bunch of technical categories and it's got a re-release value that Gone With The Wind used to have.The Force Will Be With Us Always.",10,2,4,20 September 2010
The Replacements," To finish out the season
","The Washington professional football team which is NOT named the Redskins for this film seems on the verge of a championship, but then the players in the NFL pull out and go on strike about two thirds of the season through. Naturally this does not sit well with the football public or the general sports public for that matter. No one can figure out why these well paid athletes want eight million as opposed to seven million. Owner Jack Warden who seems to be modeled on the legendary Redskins owner George Preston Marshall like his peers hires The Replacements to finish out the season. It's an interesting collection of has beens, and never wases that coach Gene Hackman has to work with. It calls for a different kind of coaching than one would normally expect, but somehow I think Vince Lombardi would approve of Hackman's methods.Chief recruit is Keanu Reeves a one time golden quarterback prospect who screwed up his own prospects, I'll not reveal how. But Reeves sees this as a shot to show what he could have done. As the most professional of this group Reeves is essential and he lets neither the team or the audience down. He also has head cheerleader Brooke Langton in his corner giving his morale a needed boost.This replacement Washington team develops a style of gonzo football like the Charleston Chiefs gonzo hockey in Slap Shot. It's what makes The Replacements the fine entertainment it is.I do have to say that I remember when baseball had a lock out and tried to negotiate with their players under a threat and did hire replacements in spring training. I still have memories of watching those spring training games with that set of replacements for the Mets in this case. I'll not forget Ralph Kiner and the rest of the Mets announcers just sounding in agony describing the game.Those replacement Mets just never got into the spirit of The Replacements.",7,0,1,7 November 2015
The Great Escape," 'We Intend To Watch This Basket Very Closely.'
","The Great Escape tells the amazing story of a whole bunch of allied prisoners who accomplish a mass breakout during World War II, some of whom actually did make it to freedom and the allied armed forces once again. The film is so good that you do not mind the fact that some American players were tossed into the story as the real story was one accomplished by the British.To insure that the American movie public would be buying tickets, several American players got into The Great Escape. Charles Bronson, James Coburn, and a pair of American TV cowboys just breaking into big screen star status, James Garner and Steve McQueen were put in the film. Director John Sturges had worked with McQueen, Coburn, and Bronson in his last film The Magnificent Seven. Sturges does a grand job in never letting his audiences attention flag for one minute in this almost three hour length film.What the Nazis have done in this film is to build a brand new prison camp and have put all the perennial escape artists in this one. Of course by doing so a whole lot of talented escape artists in one place.And the organized effort is led by Richard Attenborough. Without going overboard into a whole lot of flag waving, Sturges and Attenborough give us the portrayal of a deeply patriotic man who if he can't back into the fight himself, is going to do what he can from a POW camp to bedevil the people making war on his country. He leads the mass escape attempt with an almost corporate efficiency.The opposite of course is Steve McQueen. I've always thought of Captain Virgil Hills as the ultimate Steve McQueen role of individualism. He and flight officer Angus Lennie are going to get out, no matter what, on their own or with the group. Angus Lennie is the former jockey now RAF flight officer and his death amidst a Fourth of July party that McQueen, Garner, and Jud Taylor have is one of the most moving scenes ever put on film. McQueen decides to play for the team after that.The Great Escape allowed McQueen to indulge in one of his hobbies of motorcycling. His race through the German country side on a stolen Nazi uniform and motorcycle is a spectacular one, aided and abetted by Elmer Bernstein's magnificent film score.James Garner bonds with Donald Pleasance in the film. Garner is an American in the RAF Eagle Squadron, Americans who couldn't wait for their own country to get into the war who enlisted in the RAF. A lot of Garner's TV character of Bret Maverick is in his role as Hendley the scrounger/con artist. Pleasance is his room mate, the shy bird watcher who does the work of forging documents for the escaping prisoners. He's going blind as it turns out, my guess would be from untreated glaucoma. It's nice to see Donald Pleasance for once as a nice guy on the screen. His death due in part to his incipient blindness is also a moving one.Charles Bronson is also another foreign volunteer for the RAF, from Poland as befitting Bronson who is of Polish origin. He's the tunnel digger who suffers from claustrophobia and his scenes are primarily with British teen idol John Leyton. This was another of a long series of great character roles for Bronson on his way to stardom.James Coburn shows that like Robert Mitchum, he too had a good ear for accents. His Aussie speech pattern is as good as Mitchum's was in The Sundowners.The Germans here are also portrayed three dimensionally. Robert Graf is the not too bright corporal who isn't exactly happy to be at war, but is grateful he ain't serving in Russia. He gets unmercifully conned by Garner. Hannes Messemer is the commandant of the POW camp, an officer in the Luftwaffe. The prisoners are nearly all RAF officers and enlisted men and the Luftwaffe is in charge of the camp. Messemer is as fearful of the S.S. and the Gestapo as his prisoners are. He's also as very conscious of the atrocities those worthy organizations are capable of and my favorite scene in the film is him having to tell of one to the Senior British officer in the camp, James Donald. Messemer is conscious also of his failure to watch the basket of rotten eggs put in his charge very closely.The Great Escape does the one essential thing for a movie to do, it moves. Even in just the scenes of planning and preparation you are aware of movement. I mentioned Elmer Bernstein's film score. It's one of Bernstein's best, maybe one of the best known of any film in cinema history. The Great Escape is one of those films you can watch dozens of times and never tire of. It's a wonderful film, a real tribute to the best in mankind under some of the worst circumstances.",10,47,65,17 September 2006
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," Uneasy Alliance
","For those who read the books that this film series is based on there were no plot surprises. But filmgoers like myself might have expected that the vampires and werewolves would be going at each other in Eclipse.Not so, instead the vampires led by Robert Pattinson and the Indian werewolves featuring Taylor Lautner work out an uneasy truce in Eclipse. It's a tension filled truce because these two really hate each other because of their love of Kristen Stewart. Because of that they unite to defend against a common enemy.In nearby Seattle there have been a rash of killings and disappearances that have the city in panic. The vampires however know what's going on. Someone is recruiting a vampire army in the way that vampires have done since Bela Lugosi. And we learn in Eclipse that new vampires are the strongest because they've not learned discipline. Who's doing this is Bryce Dallas Howard, female vampire who's mate was killed by Robert Pattinson back in the first movie. She's out to get the human girl he loves in the same manner.But since Taylor Lautner is also in love with Stewart, he can get the werewolves to work in uneasy alliance with the vampires to save Kristen. It all leads to a real nasty climax of a battle.The stars are among the hottest box office there is in current Hollywood. Pattinson's soulful looks together with Stewart's beauty and Lautner's physique all have their share of fans. Personally I'm a fan of Lautner who has the finest teen body since Mario Lopez on Saved By The Bell.Nice sincere playing by the cast and the great special effects make this an undead treat. I still love the way the Indian kids wolf out to protect the tribal land.",7,1,7,8 July 2010
Pineapple Express," A Couple Of Stoners Turn Rambo
","Don't look for anything to terribly sophisticated in Pineapple Express. In fact the nuggets of humor to be mined here are few and far between.Maybe I'm old fashioned, but the notion of a minor league drug dealer and his number one customer as heroes is just a bit bizarre for my taste. But that's what happens when Seth Rogen after making a purchase of some really primo grass called Pineapple Express, just fresh on the market, he sees a murder committed by a big drug lord, Gary Cole and his girlfriend, policewoman Rosie Perez. That telltale roach he left behind leads Cole and Perez to dealer James Franco and they spend the rest of the film running for their lives. Until the very end when they turn Rambo and all the drug traffickers in two gangs get dealt with severely.And I certainly don't see anything remotely humorous in these two lugnuts looking for traveling money, selling some of this really good marijuana to school kids.But what do I know and I reached maturity in the Sixties.",2,9,22,25 August 2008
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Redefined Vampire
","For better or worse Anne Rice has redefined what a vampire is in movies and literature. Before there was the Twilight saga there was Anne writing her novels and seeing Interview With A Vampire we see that vampire now means Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt. No longer is it Bela Lugosi with his continental suaveness and Hungarian accent. But Cruise and Pitt are just as deadly, maybe more so. The film is exactly what it says. Journalist Christian Slater has tracked down Brad Pitt whom he interviews. Pitt tells him about his afterlife as a vampire dating from colonial New Orleans with a few highlights in New Orleans and Paris where he settled in the Third Republic years. There's also young Kirsten Dunst who masters a most difficult role as a child vampire. She's matured, but rather strangely.The homoeroticism sticks out all over this film especially with Cruise and Pitt when Cruise takes that bite and initiates him into the vampire existence. What beautiful children they would make it if it were possible.People who loved the Twilight Saga and other recent vampire films, this is what really starts it. Bela, it's been nice knowing you.",7,1,2,26 May 2016
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," 'Bring Up The Holy Hand Grenade'
","From the time that Michael Palin comes hopping up to a castle pretending he's on a horse with his squire clapping a pair of coconut shells together to simulate hoof-beats until at another castle with John Cleese as Sir Lancelot being showered upon with human waste product by the French garrison, Monty Python And The Holy Grail is one long laugh riot. The Monty Python troupe has won fans in every corner of the globe with their brand of nonsensical absurd type of humor, the likes of which was touched on in this country by Rowan&Martin's Laugh In.The troupe takes on the Arthurian legend and really all films with a medieval setting, things like Ivanhoe and Quentin Durward. Those original novels came from Sir Walter Scott and I often wonder what Scott would think of the Monty Python players taking apart the times he wrote about and certain paradigms from those times.No use discussing a plot here, there really isn't any. It's just Palin gathering together some knights to help him find the Holy Grail of legend. Monty Python And The Holy Grail once seen and you will never look at an Arthurian piece again without thinking of the Python absurdities.",9,0,3,27 February 2012
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Exile To Hoth
","Though the intrepid three heroes of Star Wars destroyed the Death Star commanded by Darth Vader, the rebel army is still on the run. They've taken refuge in a frozen planet called Hoth much like George Washington and the Continental Army at Valley Forge. In the meantime the Empire still searches for the rebel army in The Empire Strikes Back.When the attack comes, it comes full force, the rebels flee as do Luke Skywalker and R2D2 in one ship and Princess Leia, Han Solo, Chewbacca and C3PO. Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker is given a mission in a dream by the late Alec Guinness, killed in the first Star Wars film to receive Jedi Knight Advanced Training from the legendary Yoda and he seeks him out. Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher and company seek out Ford's old friend Lando Kalrissian to repair his ship after Ford plays a dangerous cat and mouse game with Darth Vader's battle cruiser.As Lando Kalrissian, Billy Dee Williams steps into the Star Wars pantheon of heroes and proves quite useful if not quite on the up and up. George Lucas continues his tradition of writing about futuristic Homeric like heroes in a galaxy far away. And as cinema, The Empire Strikes Back continues the quality of excellence that the original set. Looks like the Force is definitely with George Lucas.",9,0,3,24 September 2010
Saboteur," A Statue of Liberty Play
","On my VHS box of Saboteur the film was noted as Alfred Hitchcock's first with an all American cast. Thinking about it you can make that claim for it considering the foreign locations of both Rebecca and Foreign Correspondent.Saboteur involves Robert Cummings as both the pursuer and the pursued. The police think he's a Saboteur who bombed a Los Angeles aircraft factory where he worked. Cummings knows it was Norman Lloyd who did it, a mysterious man named Fry. So Cummings is both evading the cops and looking for the real Saboteur who can clear him.The chase and pursue theme is one that Hitchcock uses over and over again from The Thirty Nine Steps to North By Northwest. In both of those films it was much better done.Hitchcock did not pick his leading players in this film. Priscilla Lane had left Warner Brothers and was looking to broaden her appeal. She'd signed with Universal and Hitchcock had to take her. She's good, but she's hardly in the image of classic sophisticated Hitchcock blonds like Grace Kelly, Madeleine Carroll, or Eva Marie Saint. She's just to perky to compete with those ladies.Bob Cummintgs was a second choice, Hitchcock wanted and couldn't get Joel McCrea. That proved to be a fortunate accident. Cummings is froth with youthful idealism in his performance, he holds his own in confrontational scenes with master fifth columnist Otto Kruger.In fact the villains here are the most interesting characters. Whether they are from the isolationist mid-west like Otto Kruger or society matrons like Alma Kruger or some nobodies like Clem Bevans, Alan Baxter, or Norman Lloyd, they've drunken in the philosophy of a master race and find it heady stuff indeed. Listen to Otto Kruger's explanation for his treason, his contempt for the easily manipulated voters, his drive for power as well as money. The most frightening part of the film.More even than that climax at the Statue of Liberty. For years the torch on the statue has been closed so Cummings and Lloyd at the top is maybe even more thrilling for today's audience than at the time the film was released. But Hitchcock himself said he made a mistake, when he did the chase in North By Northwest, better to have the hero than the villain do the dangling.It's not one of Hitchcock's best films, but Saboteur holds up well for today's audience and in an age of global terror, very relevant.",6,4,7,14 June 2007
Windtalkers," Protecting a most valuable commodity
","I think the closest film analogy I can come to in describing Windtalkers is that of Go For Broke, the MGM classic film that starred Van Johnson. It told the story of the division formed by the Nisei of Hawaii, Japanese-Americans who fought in Europe in the Italian theater. Johnson's not thrilled with the prospect of commanding them, but he learns to respect their spirit and by the end of the film has bonded nicely with his Asian troops.In the Pacific Theater somebody got the brilliant idea to use Navajo Indian language as the code during battle. Up to that point the Japanese had broken all the codes the Marines had devised. That meant enlisting Navajos in the Marines to be given specific radio training.The catch is that these Navajos become a most valuable commodity and have to be protected lest they fall in Japanese hands as prisoners. That's where Nicholas Cage comes in. His specific assignment is to protect Navajo communicator Adam Beach and his radio. Like a defensive lineman protects his quarterback.Windtalkers unlike Go For Broke is not a story of the program itself. It concentrates on the special bond that forms between both Cage and Beach. To say Cage develops a political consciousness would be about right. By the end of the film Cage is protecting Beach for personal reasons. In fact there's a postscript at the end of the film with Beach back at the reservation that is beautiful and sublime.Of course there's enough blood and guts for any war film fan as well as the Navajo communication program is given its first test in the bloody battle for Saipan in the Pacific. Still the focus is one the respect and friendship that Cage and Beach develop for each other.Windtalkers, a really fine war film.",8,5,6,20 November 2016
Braveheart," Anglophobia and Homophobia
","Sad to say that Mel Gibson got a very big budget to make a very big epic about
the English-Scottish wars of the 14th century. Sad because he got to indulge two
of his biggest prejudices Anglophobia and Homophobia.The film is technically most impressive and Mel Gibson makes one virile heterosexual martyr who gets to bed the Queen of England and the big joke
Gibson is playing on us father English royal dynasty down to today.Gibson directs himself and acts as William Wallace who was the peasant leader
of the Scots who resisted England's invasion of their country. The King of England at the time was Edward I who was nicknamed Longshanks. Patrick
McGoohan plays Edward.No one ever accused old Longshanks of being a nice guy. Among other things
he did was expel the Jews from England and they did not come back until
Oliver Cromwell let them back in. And no doubt he was disappointed in his
son the Crown Prince who was as gay as green shoes as an English friend of
mine used that expression.He did not however throw Edward's boyfriend Piers Gaveston off a tower battlement. Gaveston came to a far more grisly end when the Crown Prince
became king. That is a fiction of Mr. Gibson's prejudices.As for Sophie Marceau she's gone down in English history as Isabella the She
Wolf. No doubt she was a woman with needs, but as history has it Edward II
did his kingly duty and did begat an heir who became Edward III. Edward II
reigned from 1307 to 1327 and the royal prince was born considerably after
William Wallace met his grisly end described accurately here. A product of
Gibson's stated homophobia.As impressive a cinematic achievement as Braveheart is I won't give it a good
review. God knows there have been historical films done quite inaccurately
for the sake of drama and done well. But an appeal to bigotry I will not
endorse. I would suggest a reading or a viewing of Christopher Marlowe's play
Edward II for a more accurate telling of that tragic tale.I see very little difference between Braveheart and Jew Suss produced by Joe
Goebbels to stoke Anti-Semitism in Nazi Germany.Shame on you Mel Gibson for your lies and distortions.",3,6,12,23 October 2018
Slumdog Millionaire," It's not supposed to be in his experience
","Slumdog Millionaire which earned 8 Oscars including a Best Picture has some elements of a couple of other films that I liked. It also has no nominations in the acting categories.For the latter I think it's a combined performance. Protagonist Dev Patel whose life we see in flashback gives a performance with two other juvenile actors. It's a combined look at his life so I think no one actor could or should be credited that way. In fact Patel is telling his life in the interrogation room of a police station.Patel is a slum kid referred to as slumdogs by the Indian cops. He's a guest on the Indian version of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire and he's one answer away from the all or nothing grand prize jackpot. He's hauled away and interrogated by the Mumbai cops who just don't believe some slum kid from Mumbai could know things like who is on the American hundred dollar bill and who invented the revolver. But it turns out that as they question him and rather brutally at times, he's acquired this trivial pursuit type knowledge through life experience.I was so reminded of Stand And Deliver when the cops haul away Dev Patel because they won't believe some uneducated slumdog kid could know so much. If you remember Edward James Olmos's math class all got retested with strict monitoring to prove they were the real deal. As for the scenes of Indian life and what the ragamuffin kids go through the influence of the Brazilian film Pixote is clearly visible. Occidental director Danny Boyle did a great job of capturing the overpopulation and dire poverty so omnipresent in the world's largest democracy. If population trends keep going India may well pass China as the world's largest country.With a Best Picture Oscar, the Indian cinema has clearly arrived on the American consciousness if nowhere else. Oscars tend to do that with Americans.",8,1,2,9 July 2016
Hacksaw Ridge," The 'using kind of religion'.
","I guess that Hacksaw Ridge could probably best be compared to the great Gary Cooper film Sergeant York which hewed pretty close to the truth about Alvin C. York, his background in Eastern Tennessee and his exploits in World War I. Like our protagonist Desmond Doss here, York had a rural background and joined a pacifist religious sect. Unlike Doss, York grew up as a hunter and was a dead shot. He wasn't sure what he would do if a combat situation arose. But he did what he did and got every decoration imaginable including the Congressional Medal Of Honor.Doss had a tougher row to hoe. He would not touch a weapon and the film will show you why. He felt it his patriotic duty to join, but as a combat medic, save lives rather than kill. With no weapon to defend his own person, this medic saved a lot of people at an engagement at a place dubbed Hacksaw Ridge in the Battle of Okinawa.In Sergeant York, Walter Brennan's country preacher character says that Gary Cooper has the 'using kind of religion'. That might well be said of Andrew Garfield as Desmond Doss who got a Best Actor Oscar nomination as Doss. Cooper won one of his two Oscars for Sergeant York and Garfield really suggests his character in what he does with Doss.The battle scenes are suggestive of Saving Private Ryan, director Mel Gibson staged them well. Hacksaw Ridge did win a pair of Oscars for its Sound. Gibson got nominated for Best Director and the film itself for Best Picture.Hacksaw Ridge shows the horrors of war and from it the beauty of heroism when people have to summon their personal best and become more than themselves. The Doss story is one that deserves telling and retelling. Thanks to Mel Gibson it will be permanently retold.",8,2,4,3 April 2017
The Breakfast Club," Enforced socialization
","The 80s was the decade of the Brat Pack and the decade of John Hughes who did films that spoke to teens and 20 somethings of the era. His enduring classic was The Breakfast Club a character study of a cross section of teen America of the Reagan years.In my childhood and adolescent years the culture had a great divide on what made the young tick. The model were shows like Leave It To Beaver and The Donna Reed Show. All the kids were wholesome and clean cut. The polar opposite was found on the big screen in Rebel Without A Cause and dozens of pale imitations of hot rodding kids. And the girls for the most part were just orbiting satellites around the males.That's the most radical thing about The Breakfast Club I Found. The teen princess Molly Ringwald and the weird girl Ally Sheedy are most definitely not satellites around the males. Although Ringwald could have shown up on The Donna Reed Show she like the others is a complex character with her own issues regarding school and life. Sheedy was something unique, an oddball who not only doesn't fit in but regards that as a virtue. Not that people weren't like her in real life, but just not shown on the big screen or small.The 'good' kids are jock Emilio Estevez and overachiever scholar Anthony Michael Hall. Superficially both of those could be Donna Reed or Brady Bunch characters. What's revealed is both are just trying to fit into their assigned niches in life and both question why is there so much pressure to succeed. One has suicidal intentions because of it.Judd Nelson is your James Dean character, good but truly the least original of all the charter members of The Breakfast Club. He could truly have been part of the motorcycle clique that Dean belonged to in Rebel Without A Cause. Dean himself bared his soul, Nelson took a bit longer to do it on the screen. For him and Sheedy detention is just part of the day. The other three are new to it and in the normal course of school day they would not be caught dead associating with these two or in fact each other. They all have their cliques except Sheedy who is a total loner. In the end they find they have a lot of the same issues and anxieties. Detention enforced socialization on them.Paul Gleason plays the school principal and in his career he took out a patent on these authority figures who are so alien to the kids. He did the part of the principal in so many films and TV shows his appearance almost became expected like Margaret Dumont in a Marx Brothers comedy. The Breakfast Club became his signature part.The Breakfast Club is a true classic, long and deep on character almost like a Eugene O'Neil play.",9,5,7,17 September 2013
Contact," An Awful Waste Of Space
","Although Jodie Foster has won two Oscars in her career I think her best work was done in Contact, a film where the only recognition it received was a nomination for Best Sound. She also never did a more serious film about a more serious topic. Are we in fact the only life there is in this vast universe and how do we find out.As a scientist, something she wanted to be all her life, Foster is determined to get answers in the best way she knows, build the biggest radio telescope there is and throw out a few signals. Someone out in the great beyond will answer. Foster gets an answer.What I love about Contact is that the gamut of human reactions to the possibility of life is dealt with in this film. It ranges from the multi-billionaire who wants his own life extended John Hurt, the geopolitician who is interested in power James Woods, the sincerely religious men of faith who want to see how God fits into the scheme of things Matthew McConaughey, and even the religious terrorist who fears that a mountain of man made dogma that he's based his life on will be washed away Jake Busey. Busey's part is extremely relevant, we have way too many of those in the world and strategically placed they can cause catastrophe.Foster gets a blueprint for a space time travel machine, warp drive the likes of which James T. Kirk only wished he had. It goes horribly wrong the first time, Foster takes it herself for a second try.Mention should also go to David Morse who plays Foster's father, first in scenes with young Jena Malone who was a science prodigy as a kid and later Foster during her 'journey' gets to talk to Morse again. Was it real or a hallucination. His scenes are the highlight of the film for me.Contact takes no sides in the end, it simply takes the position that in terms of the universe humankind is taking baby steps. If we are really the only life in the universe it seems like an awful waste of space.The special effects are fine, the sound was considered Academy worthy. So much more of Contact is, most especially the performances of Jodie Foster and her supporting cast.",9,2,6,19 January 2015
Born on the Fourth of July," Enough to radicalize anyone
","Born On The 4th Of July using that line from George M. Cohan's Yankee Doodle Dandy tells the story of Ron Kovic, Vietnam Marine veteran who gradually evolved into an anti-war activist after his Vietnam experience. Tom Cruise played the lead and got an Oscar nomination for his performance. At the time it was considered quite daring for Oliver Stone to cast Cruise in this film. Up to that point Tom Cruise had done little but Brat Pack style films appealing to his adoring female fans. I think he showed promise as an actor in All The Right Moves and I think Stone saw that film and saw the same thing.As this film opens in 1961 we see young Ron Kovic taking in the words of newly inaugurated president John F. Kennedy about asking what you can do for your country and deciding to enlist in the Marines. Kennedy upped the commitment to 20,000.00 troops as opposed to a few hundred advisers. Later on he might have been rethinking the commitment, but we'll never know and that's a subject for another film. In fact in his JFK film Oliver Stone does touch on that subject.The closest thing to the Vietnam experience that the US ever had was the Filipino insurrection in terms of the type of warfare waged. Not too many were alive in the Sixties who remembered that. The commitment was there, but just who and where was the enemy? Vietnamese wanted to settle their own country's destiny, but like so many others it was caught between the two Cold War rivals. Before he received his wounds that made him a paraplegic Cruise sees a whole lot in Vietnam that makes him wonder just why we're there. But he's a middle class kid from Long Island who's been brought up with certain values among them not to question the aims and intentions of American leadership. After the Vietnam experience the film becomes his realization that he and comrades might not have had any business there in the first place. That's enough to radicalize anyone.Some other performances to single out are Raymond Barry and Caroline Kava as Cruise's parents. Especially Kava who is a strict Catholic and does not allow questioning of anything in her household. Kyra Sedgwick is fine as the girl next door who in the end can't marry him because of what will be lacking in their marriage.On that topic I'm sure Oliver Stone channeled Ernest Hemingway and his creation of Jake Barnes in The Sun Also Rises. How prescient was Papa Hemingway to write of Kovic's experience a couple of generations earlier. One also wonders what Hemingway might have thought of Kovic's experience against his character Barnes.Oliver Stone got a Best Director Oscar for Born On The Fourth Of July and the film also got an Oscar for Editing. Plus a flock of other nominations besides the one for Tom Cruise including Best Picture.Born On The 4th Of July is a valuable piece of cinema and history and a milestone for Oliver Stone and Tom Cruise.",8,3,10,6 July 2014
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," If They Couldn't Get The Ark Of The Covenant, They'll Settle For The Holy Grail
","When Indiana Jones went on his last crusade in search of the Holy Grail, the adventure took him to such far flung places as Venice, Vienna, Berlin, and the fictitious kingdom of Hatay in the Middle East. Well he wasn't just searching for the Holy Grail.A mysterious millionaire who's been a benefactor of archeology played by Julian Glover has hired the senior Henry Jones, who's always been a Grail seeker to look for it. But he's turned up quite missing and it's up to Harrison Ford to find his father.In an inspired piece of casting Sean Connery plays the senior Doctor Jones and the chemistry between Ford and Connery is fine. Connery is so good in the part that he makes you forget that it's usually Connery who gets to do the action stuff. Ford of course bares the burden of it while rescuing Dad from the clutches of the Nazis. They too are in pursuit of the Holy Grail. I guess if they couldn't get the Ark of the Covenant, they'll settle for the Grail. They've got a lovely female scientist in the person of Alison Doody in on the hunt.While I was watching Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade, the thought struck me that this was also the plot of Abbott and Costello Meet The Mummy. Of course with a budget a gazillion times more. But in that film Bud and Lou are in pursuit of Klaris the Mummy, Marie Windsor and a couple of henchmen are also after it, and so are the followers of Klaris led by Richard Deacon intent from not letting the secret out. Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade also has a group of people who know the secret of the Holy Grail, where it is, and they're not letting ANYONE remotely near it.Indiana Jones regulars like John Rhys-Davies and Denholm Elliott are also here and I also like the performance of 81 year old Robert Eddison in his next to last film as the Grail Knight. His is an astounding story and the last shot of him is for me the most memorable moment of the film.The first Indiana Jones film came out at the beginning of the Eighties and it's fitting and proper that this film came out as that decade came to a close. It's a worthy successor and in some ways superior to the first two films and a grand show.",9,2,5,15 June 2008
Goodfellas," The Criminal Mindset
","The gangster film has been redefined so many times in cinema history it will be interesting to see how it is redefined once again. Goodfellas is a milestone film in that regard because just as Public Enemy and Little Caesar defined it in the Thirties, The Godfather trilogy in the seventies and eighties, Goodfellas set the standard that all other films including Martin Scorsese similar Casino try to meet. The interesting thing is that Martin Scorsese is young enough to redefine it again with another work.With Ray Liotta narrating his own life in crime in a flashback as real life criminal Henry Hill, Martin Scorsese offers us one fascinating glimpse of the criminal life in the Eisenhower to Reagan era. Henry Hill even as a child got sucked into the criminal life as a kid, as he said all he ever wanted to be was a gangster. Tutored by both Robert DeNiro and Paul Sorvino, Liotta takes part in one of the biggest heists of all time of Lufthansa Airlines at JFK Airport during the seventies. Goodfellas is the story of the events from Henry Hill's perspective leading up to the heist and the aftermath.For myself I've never seen the gangster mentality better expressed on screen except maybe by Sean Connery in Family Business. Liotta and Connery operate from the same mindset. If you work hard and hope it pays off in success, you're a dope. If you want something, just take it. When you come right down to it, that's how criminals think, it's the rest of us who are fools.Goodfellas was nominated for several Oscars, but came away with only one winner, Joe Pesci in the role of crazy Tommy DeVito. He's another criminal type, one who's driven by a terrible inferiority complex due to his short stature and does terrible things even to his own peers. And those peers don't forget as you see what happens to Pesci in Goodfellas. This turned out to be a career role for Pesci. He's a multi-talented man who's got an incredible range and can play everything from the Home Alone comedies to stone killers like here in Goodfellas or in Casino.There's usually a contest in which Scorsese fans argue whether Casino or Goodfellas is better. I happen to like Casino, but without the success of Goodfellas, Casino would not have been made.For a fascinating look at the criminal mindset, Goodfellas is an absolute must.",9,3,5,15 February 2007
The Great Gatsby," Good film, bad musical score
","Only a poor soundtrack filled with contemporary music spoiled this latest version of The Great Gatsby for me. In a tradition of blond Gatsbys, Leonardo DiCaprio steps into the shoes of Alan Ladd and Robert Redford in essaying the part of the social climbing bootlegger from the Roaring Twenties. All that will make Jay Gatsby's life complete is the love of Daisy Buchanan whom he courted before his service in World War I. The problem is that she's slightly married to upper class Tom Buchanan. Daisy is played by Carey Mulligan and Buchanan is played by Australian player Joel Edgerton.In fact except for DiCaprio and Tobey Maguire as Nick Carraway the whole cast is mostly Australian which is to be expected since most of the production was shot there. I have to say that the Australian studio did a marvelous job in recreating New York of the Twenties and the ritzy and glamorous part of Long Island where most of the story takes place.As the book is written in the person of Nick Carraway it was also a good move to have Maguire narrate the story. Tobey's narration gives us the background of the story and Carraway's character functions as he should.Leonardo DiCaprio does a wonderful job playing the social climbing Gatsby who weaves his own legend as he gives fabled parties on Long Island where the illegal liquor flows freely. Beneath his self assurance there is a bit of a frightened edge like this is all going to be taken away from him so enjoy while you can. Perhaps the producers thought that no one would see a film with old music in it. There is some there, Gershwin's Rhapsody In Blue comes to mind. But the contemporary music on the soundtrack is jarring and out of place.But overall this is a good telling of F. Scott Fitzgerald's tale of the Roaring Twenties.",7,8,12,30 July 2013
The Proposal," A Wise Career Move
","In The Proposal Sandra Bullock finds herself in real dilemma. A workaholic executive in the publishing business, she's Canadian by birth and has failed to renew her visa. As she says, that's practically being an American anyway. Not good enough says immigration official Denis O'Hare and Bullock's boss Michael Nouri agrees. Sandra's got to do something fast.Enter Ryan Reynolds her hunky young executive assistant who for better or worse has his career tied to her's. What's a guy to do, but go along with those other for better or worse words as she announces to the world that her young assistant is also her fianc√©. It's not the most romantic of proposals, but he'll go along at least temporarily until INS stops looking and then they can get a quickie divorce.But then to go along with the gag, Bullock and Reynolds fly to his home town which is Sitka, Alaska and at that point The Proposal becomes a combination of The Devil Wears Prada and Northern Exposure. Enter Reynolds family which is parents Craig T. Nelson and Mary Steenburgen, grandmother Betty White, and a former girlfriend in Malin Akerman and a host of town characters that look like some of Rob Morrow's former patients. Bullock who lost her family early on and has none to speak of gets really comfortable with them and very comfortable indeed with Reynolds.Sandra and Ryan certainly make a nice pair of leads. But I think acting honors go to Betty White who's pretty close in real life to the 89 year old granny she plays here. They also go to Denis O'Hare. He's a great example of a smarmy and officious bureaucrat people hate instinctively.Ironic isn't it because Sandra Bullock is not a terrorist, in fact she's contributing quite a bit to the American economy here. The Proposal takes a strong look at our immigration laws which are incredibly out of whack in this country. Our strength as a nation was the immigrants who came here for a better life. Now we seem to discourage that.As for Reynolds, it might be a wise career move he's making, but as it turns out these two really get to know each other and it might just work out after all.The Proposal is a really nice romantic comedy, don't miss it while it is still in theaters.",8,14,36,15 July 2009
The Birds," Our Avian Friends Attack
","The Birds is one of the very few Alfred Hitchcock films that owes more to special effects than to any great story line or acting performances. It's those birds turning on mankind in Bodega Bay that you come to see this film and that's what you get.Those of the lesser species that mankind hasn't killed off live either in harmony with man or in an undeclared truce. What if a species all of a sudden, previously docile, decides to turn on man? Birds are something we may like or dislike but we do take their passivity in most cases for granted.It's not hunting or preying birds like the eagle and hawk that do the turning in Bodega Bay, it's scavenger birds like gulls and crows. And they're working together with a kind of unseen intelligence guiding them. That's what's most scary.The human players Rod Taylor, Tippi Hedren, Suzanne Pleshette, Jessica Tandy and the rest are really of little importance. Everyone does their part well, but their little stories fade to insignificance. The Birds starts as almost a Doris Day/Rock Hudson type comedy as Rod Taylor comes into a pet shop and mistakes Tippi for a salesperson. They have their Rock and Doris like banter and she gets his license number and follows him down to Bodega Bay, a sleepy little California coast village.The way Hitchcock made Santa Rosa a part of Shadow of a Doubt, he does the same here with Bodega Bay. Unlike in Shadow of a Doubt though the town as well as The Birds dwarf the plot of the film.As Rod and Tippi do their Rock/Doris thing The Birds start their attacks and turn the place into panic city. As it probably would in any situation. What's really spooky about the whole thing is that Hitchcock leaves it totally unresolved. We don't know what the town will do about these aggressive avians. Or for that matter what mankind itself will do.",7,5,10,11 January 2007
Cinderella Man," Braddock's Story, Not Baer's
","Though Cinderella Man got great critical notices it did not do well at the box office which is a shame for those who missed a great sports story and Russell Crowe's performance as James J. Braddock.Between the time Gene Tunney retired in 1928 and Joe Louis ascended to boxing's heavyweight championship, there were a succession of champions who were not among the greatest, but who in and of themselves had some interesting stories. In order they were, Max Schmeling, Jack Sharkey, Primo Carnera, Max Baer and finally the working class champion James J. Braddock. Most of these guys fought each other and Joe Louis in fact on his way up the ladder fought and licked all of them except most notoriously Schmeling.Jim Braddock was a promising light heavyweight in the late twenties who got a title shot against champion Tommy Loughran and lost. As is the usual pattern of things, Braddock went gradually downhill and at the same time injured his right hand. This was the Great Depression and Braddock took work on the docks as a longshoreman to support his wife and family.Ron Howard did a fine job in recreating the era of Braddock and got a great performance out of Russell Crowe as the man. What Crowe gives you as Braddock is the real deal. Crowe nearly won an Oscar on the strength of a very touching scene with one of his children who he caught stealing a loaf of bread. Economics were bad, but Braddock's values stood the test.I suppose it was a matter of necessity, every heroic story has to have a villain and poor Max Baer's reputation suffers as a result of it. Craig Bierko is fine as Max Baer, but he did not give you the real Max at all. Baer was a savage puncher and in fact was responsible for the death of two men in the ring. Ron Howard shows him as a man with no regrets about that. In fact Baer was deeply affected by the deaths and held his punches on many occasions because of it.Baer was however a party animal who loved a good time above all. That was his undoing in his real career and in the film. Viewers will also like Paul Giamatti as Braddock's shrewd and loyal manager Joe Gould. Giamatti's performance might seem a caricature yet boxing manager were and are very much like Joe Gould, at least the best of them.As a personal story and a sports story Cinderella Man rates as one of the best films so far in this new millenia of our's. I wouldn't miss it when it's broadcast. Too bad that so many folks did miss it on the big screen.",10,8,12,21 August 2007
Jurassic Park," Some things dead, should stay dead
","As a kid I so well remember my younger brother and those dinosaur toys he had as a kid. We've seen dinosaurs in film before going back to the silent version of The Lost World. But they were never better shown than when Steven Spielberg made Jurassic Park out of Michael Crichton's novel. These put other screen dinosaurs to shame.Through some cloning billionaire Richard Attenborough has succeeded in recreating those long dead creatures of the past and now has a theme park, Jurassic Park. All the herbivores and the carnivores of the past are now alive. But when you come right down to it, Attenborough has just become another Dr. Frankenstein. Some things dead should stay dead.At least that's what scientists Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum try to tell him. And I have to admit Attenborough does have state of the art security. But he has a greedy employee in Wayne Knight who has made a secret deal with some rival tycoon. His greed brings the whole operation to disaster as dinosaurs start running amuck.The tyrannosaurus rexes and the raptors are what captured the imagination of the public when Jurassic Park was reached. Up to that time dinosaurs when they were on screen were slow moving behemoths. Spielberg's dinosaurs have some speed to them, far more like what they were in the Jurassic Age.I have to say I loved Wayne Knight's performance in Jurassic Park. He's such a loathsome creep, but also a real putz. The end he meets is truly just.Jurassic Park and its successors and imitators have brought about a renewed interest in paleontology. That's always healthy in any society, an interest in the sciences.My brother Daniel loved this film when it came out. As will you.",9,2,4,26 July 2016
Beetlejuice," The dos and don'ts of haunting
","This is one rollicking movie about the afterlife. What I get from it is that it ain't
a place of tranquility. At least that's the way it is for the recently deceased Alec
Baldwin and Geena Davis.This married couple drive off a bridge and drown though the fact they're dead
isn't immediately apparent. When that fact is accepted some new folks buy the
place. The new couple is Jeffrey Jones,
Catherine O'Hara and their daughter Winona Ryder.Ryder is a Goth kid who sees the ghosts and convnces the parents. Jones has
big plans for the place that don't include spirits. He sends for deorator/exorcist Glenn Shadix. Baldwin and Davis send for wild and crazy
spirit Beeteljuice.Michael Keaton is our most unconventional ghost. He gives out with one
ribald and insane film performance, a cross between Robin Williams and Steve
Martin. Don't move don't blink or you will miss a crazy gesture or line. Keaton
helps, but he always does things his way.The makeup used for Keaton and all the other spirits won an Oscar for the
film. Director Tim Burton is on top of his game with Beetlejuice.",7,0,1,21 October 2019
Valkyrie," Point Man For The Bomb Plot Against Hitler
","Tom Cruise is one of those actors who can't shake a youthful image. When one thinks of him, one thinks of All The Right Moves, Top Gun, even Taps as the young brat packer. Of all the young players of the Eighties labeled the Brat Pack, Cruise has had the most staying power by far. In Valkyrie, Cruise holds his own with some classically trained players from across the pond like Terrence Stamp, Kenneth Branagh, and Tom Wilkinson. These folks in varying degrees participate in the plot named Operation Valkyrie to assassinate Adolph Hitler and hopefully bring about a short conclusion of the war. Working against them was the unconditional surrender policy agreed to by the Allies. Everyone well remembered Hitler's skillful use of the betrayal issue that came about in that interregnum between the Armistice and the Versailles Treaty. The Allies wanted Germany beaten with no doubt about it this time around.And they would have had to have bagged a whole gang of them, Himmler, Goering, Goebbels, Bormann etc. for it to work. Nobody on the Allied side would have dealt with any of these specimens. In fact when they did break the policy and negotiate a surrender with Marshal Pietro Badoglio and due to circumstances to lengthy to go into here, the objective was not accomplished and we had a yard by yard war up the Italian peninsula instead of a quick surrender.Cruise let's face it is not a brat packer any more. In fact he's roughly the age that Stauffenberg was when he became the point man for bombing on July 20, 1944. He even looks a bit like him. There's also a trace of the German aristocratic air about him that Stauffenberg was. Claus von Stauffenberg did come from an old Catholic aristocratic family with a military tradition who saw the Nazis as parvenus. But it was hard to argue with Hitler's early military success, especially for a military man.The performance really to watch here is that of Tom Wilkinson who is a really oily individual as General Fromm who was trying so hard to keep himself in good with both sides so he could come out on top. As for what happened to him, watch a very worthwhile film to find out.",8,8,9,20 February 2011
All the President's Men," The Story Of A Lifetime
","The United States Of America lost its political innocence with the Watergate scandals. The effects of what happened starting with those burglars caught breaking into the Democratic headquarters of the Watergate Apartment complex and what came afterward will damage the national psyche for the next few centuries.What always got me about Watergate is that it was so unnecessary for Richard Nixon's re-election. And that was what it was all about. Nixon was at the peak of popularity, he would have won in 1972 without all the shenanigans pulled by his Committee to Re-Elect the President. But in the possessed mind of Richard Nixon who saw enemies everywhere, it wasn't enough to just beat the Democratic opponent.It was also why the Watergate scandal took hold, the motives behind it were strictly political, to re-elect the incumbent president. Iran/Contra never got the traction that Watergate got because in the final analysis it was about foreign policy differences. The motives if not pure were not tainted with partisanship either.Films like Nixon with Anthony Hopkins and Nixon/Frost with Frank Langella give you a view of the man at the center of it all. Another rather skewered view of Watergate can be gotten from the film Born Again about Chuck Colson, one of the key players in Watergate. But this film is from the outside looking in. It takes two fairly new reporters from the Washington Post, Robert Woodward and Carl Bernstein, covering the police beat of the Post who are in night court as the Watergate burglars are arraigned and slowly realize they could be sitting on the story of a lifetime.Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman are Woodward and Bernstein. Editor Ben Bradlee played by Jason Robards realizes that in the final analysis this is a crime story first and foremost. So rather than give it to some top political reporter, he lets Woodward and Bernstein run with it. It made their reputations down to today.Director Alan J. Pakula made clever use of the color newsreel footage and interspersed it with the dramatic story. Through the newsreels the well known names and faces actually do become actors in the proceedings.In fact despite the fact that Jason Robards won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor and Jane Alexander for playing the bookkeeper at the campaign headquarters got nominated for Best Supporting Actress, the key performance in the film in my opinion is that of Robert Walden who played Donald Segretti, a young attorney who became part of the White House plumbers dirty tricks squad. He's the only one of the Watergate principals who gets a full blown fictional portrayal here. He gives the Watergate scandal the face for the viewer and its not a pretty one.All The President's Men missed the Best Picture Oscar and a Best Director for Alan J. Pakula. But it managed to win Oscars for Best Sound, Best Art&Set Direction and Best Adapted Screenplay besides the Oscar Robards won.Both Redford and Hoffman who are a couple of name players as stars gave what would be subdued performances in the sense that they never allowed their star personas to interfere with the telling of the story. That's what makes All The President's Men such a lasting classic.",9,6,7,5 March 2010
The Wizard of Oz," A Whiz Of A Wiz If Ever A Wiz There Was
","When you've got a classic film that several generations of fans eagerly look forward to seeing televised every year, what critics say doesn't really matter. Several generations of the movie going public have made their voices heard loud and clear. It doesn't even matter that not one member of the cast is still with us to occasionally promote the film. It's reputation precedes it.What lucky accidents for two performers in the celebrated cast. First Judy Garland got her break because Darryl Zanuck would not loan Shirley Temple out at any price. She was just making more money for hi studio than anyone else in Hollywood and he wasn't going to cut Louis. B. Mayer in for a dime.However when MGM contract player Buddy Ebsen had a toxic allergic reaction to that Tin Man makeup paint, there was Zanuck happy to loan Jack Haley to MGM for what turned out to be his career role. In fact all seven of the stars, Judy Garland and her adult co-stars all got the roles they are most identified with. Tell me another film that can claim that?Back at the turn of the last century L. Frank Baum adapted his Oz stories to the Broadway stage in 1903. Baum wrote the play and also most of the song lyrics, none of which had any staying power. The great vaudeville team of David Montgomery and Fred Stone starred on Broadway for 293 performances. Stone played the Scarecrow and I could see him doing it, though not quite the same as Ray Bolger, Stone played all kinds of rustics when he later went to Hollywood. Montgomery played a character name I had not heard of, in fact if you look down a cast list on the Internet Broadway Database, you'll see a ton of characters you wouldn't be familiar with unless you read all the Baum Oz stories.MGM simplified and cut away a lot to bring what nearly all moviegoers on the planet are familiar with today. Included is new music which brought for The Wizard Of Oz it's two Oscars, for MGM house composer Herbert Stothart one for best musical scoring and for Harold Arlen and E.Y. Harburg for Over The Rainbow, Best Song of 1939.That song almost didn't make the picture. In his infinite wisdom Louis B. Mayer pronounced the number as too much for a juvenile like Judy Garland, it belonged to someone like Nelson Eddy. Director Victor Fleming insisted it be kept in and the result was an Oscar and a song that Judy Garland could never do a live performance without. Though her voice and persona changed from winsome juvenile to the greatest female singing star ever, Over The Rainbow adapted itself over the years to her aging. Judy's now over that rainbow for many years as are Ray Bolger, Jack Haley, Bert Lahr as the Cowardly Lion, Billie Burke as Glinda the Good Witch. Margaret Hamilton who scares the waste product out anybody as the Wicked Witch of the West. Kids even now when first seeing her have nightmares, I can speak from first hand experience there. We can't leave out traveling medicine showman and the title character Frank Morgan. To think all these people in one film got their career roles.For their time the special effects were breathtaking, from the tornado that took Dorothy Gale and her house over the rainbow to the mystical land of Oz. The camera work of Hal Rosson and the imagination of Buddy Gillespie in the MGM special effects department hold our rapt attention to this day.Back when she was starting the terrible twos, my niece Tara got to see The Wizard Of Oz for the first time. At that point for the next three years it became her ultimate babysitting tool. You sat her in front of the television, plopped in The Wizard Of Oz and just left her alone. She wouldn't move, but it got so bad that her parents and both grandmothers just got totally Wizarded out and couldn't look at the film for years.Knowing there's a Tara out there as I write this who is getting her first exposure to the Wizard Of Oz, this review is dedicated to her and all the youngsters like her and untold millions that will follow.",10,9,11,16 March 2009
The Martian," Tasks for your survival
","Although The Martian is set in an indeterminate future I have questions about labeling it science fiction. One of the film's best strengths is that it is based on what we know about the landscape and atmosphere of Mars right at this point in time. It's a desert planet with water and no life as we know it. Compared to what Matt Damon has to go through, Robinson Crusoe was on that tropical isle for a picnic.They never really say just exactly what year The Martian is set in. The film in that sense avoids a trap like so many others fall into. Just this past year we saw 2015 come and go and it wasn't really anything like the 2015 that Marty McFly experienced. That's just one example.Of course you can also never predict what popular trends will be there. That's purely speculative. So you can't have Matt Damon's character listening to current music. His captain's taste in music was 70s disco and that really became a running joke. It's all he heard for the months he was on Mars. Personally I'd prefer a selection of 30s and 40s music with Bing Crosby at the top of my list. But if that's all I heard for months on end, I'd grow to hate Der Bingle. And that's part of the story, the everlasting boredom trying to keep your mind fresh and busy with tasks for your survival. Like Mr. Roberts from tedium to apathy and always boredom.What happens in The Martian is that Damon is part of an astronaut team and gets left behind when a Martian sand storm erupts and the crew flees on the space ship. Captain Jessica Chastain takes when she thinks Damon was killed. The future also brings us better communication and NASA learns that Matt's still there. To say that there's a public relations problem is putting it mildly. Just leaving him there is actually an option discussed. But that goes against the code of a decent civilization which while we're not at Star Trek level yet, we look to be heading that way.Although The Martian splits time evenly with Damon's plight and the efforts to rescue him, Matt's time alone on the screen with the full range of emotions displayed is what got him his Best Actor nomination. Besides the realistic depiction of Mars, his performance is the other pillar on which this fine film rests. I would give mention to Jessica Chastain and her fine performance as a tough and yet humane leader of her team.Besides Matt Damon, The Martian is also up for Best Picture and for a flock of awards in the technical categories. It should take home deserved statues this year.",8,4,6,29 January 2016
The Fighter," His Strength And Weakness
","I'm figuring that The Fighter is going to win one flock of awards just looking at the nominations already received by this film by several film ratings organizations. The Fighter should be good to go for the Oscars, especially for Mark Wahlberg, Christian Bale, and Melissa Leo.This is the true story of Micky Ward who lived a real life Rocky story albeit in a lighter weight class. Ward like the screen Rocky Balboa was headed for the career of a steppingstone type pug who turned things around in a very big way. He also redeemed the family name somewhat because he had an older brother who had a title shot, but lost it and then turned to a life of petty crime. Mark Wahlberg who never seems to lose his New England speech pattern no matter what role he's cast in is brilliant as Micky Ward. I'm betting that it's a matter of pride to him because he certainly could afford the speech lessons. Wahlberg's biggest problem in the film is his family they are his strength and weakness. That's something he could draw from in his own family if you know something of his background.Opposite Wahlberg is Christian Bale who has played all kinds of roles with differing accents in his career. He's as skilled as Robert Mitchum was at accents. He's got the Boston accent down perfectly as the older brother who's doing time in the can for some petty criminality and his scene at showing the pangs of crack withdrawal are reminiscent of Frank Sinatra in The Man With A Golden Arm.But I think who really owns this film in whatever scene she's in is Melissa Leo, mother of nine children, who doubled first as manager for Bale in his career and now is steering Wahlberg's career. If she's not nominated for an Oscar in the Best Supporting Actress category she will have been robbed. Seems like I've heard that in a boxing story before.The Fighter was shot in Lowell, Massachusetts where Ward and his family are from and director David Russell is as good with the camera as with his players. He and his film merit considerable Oscar consideration.Do not miss a film that is destined to become one of the great boxing movies ever.",10,4,9,24 December 2010
Up in the Air," Lack of commitment
","Seeing the character that George Clooney plays in Up In The Air reminds me of George Peppard in The Carpetbaggers. If you remember Jonas Cord was flying all over creation in his private plane developing and supervising his many enterprises. Just like Clooney here, Peppard had some deep seated issues about settling down even though unlike Clooney he was already married.Clooney has an interesting job that really keeps him moving. He works for a firm that specializes in aiding fired workers make a transition. I can testify myself that getting fired can be traumatic. In my case though my firing lasted two months and I went back to my old job and stayed there until retirement.Clooney's boss Jason Bateman has him going all over the country. He says that he spent only about 43 days in his sparse apartment in Omaha. It really is sparse the various hotel rooms look more homey. But a woman who also spends a lot of time traveling on her job Vera Famiga and a woman who is being trained by Clooney, Anna Kendrick help him see that maybe his life and lack of commitment isn't the best thing for him.Nor is his stated goal of gaining 10 million frequent flier miles. He spends so much time in the air that all the airline personnel on all the airlines know him on a first name basis. That's one significant accomplishment. Maybe Clooney should have taken up with a stewardess.The characters are drawn well in this script which got one of several Academy Award nominations, in this case for adapted screenplay. Up In The Air also got Academy recognition for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor for Clooney, Best Actress for Famigia, and Best Supporting Actress for Kendrick. I thought Kendrick was especially good as the young lady who sees a career treadmill she doesn't like and gets off.Up In The Air is an intelligent and modern comedy with some characters I think we can all identify with.",7,1,1,27 January 2015
From Here to Eternity," A Realistic View of the Army
","One of the big blockbuster best sellers of the post World War II years is James Jones's From Here to Eternity, a tale of the peacetime army in Hawaii before Pearl Harbor. The book was definitely going to be made into a film and it was only a question of casting to make it a success.Director Fred Zinneman had a good intuitive sense about casting here, even against type. The two principal female parts were done against type. Deborah Kerr who made a career of playing respectable women played a captain's wife who's drinking and playing around. Not that husband Philip Ober is letting grass grow under his feet either, but Kerr's latest sexual exploit involves her with the First Sergeant of her husband's company, Burt Lancaster. Donna Reed, who up to that point was best known for being Mary Bailey in It's A Wonderful Life, plays a prostitute here. A girl from the wrong side of the tracks, jilted by a rich boyfriend stateside, she's in Hawaii to make money and then go home and buy some respectability. She's not looking for romance with any soldiers, but you can't plan these things.Especially Montgomery Clift if he comes in your life. It's been argued that this is Clift's greatest role and a case can sure be made for it. His character of Robert E. Lee Pruitt is like so many who still join the army today, from small town America who have no future there and find a home in the Armed Services. What makes Clift unique is that strong sense of individualism he can't control in an organization that does not encourage individuality.Clift and Lancaster are a great study in contrasts and that's what drives From Here to Eternity. Lancaster as Sergeant Milt Warden is the ultimate professional soldier, held in the highest regard by his men. Lancaster is someone who knows how to work the system, you see it in the way he manipulates his captain. Of course he's got to be a manipulator there since he's having an affair with Deborah Kerr. He tries to protect Clift from himself and ultimately fails.Clift has transferred into an infantry company and he was at one time a boxer. But he blinded someone in a fight and quit boxing. Philip Ober who prides himself on having several champions in various weight classes worked to get Clift in his company. Clift upsets his plans by refusing to box so he has the various sergeants give him 'the treatment.' Clift's best friend in the company is a tough street wise soldier from the big city named Angelo Maggio, played by Frank Sinatra. Sinatra read the book and knew this part was for him. He did everything he had to do to get that part, including working for scale. At the time Sinatra was considered a has been as singer and actor. Sinatra was right on the money in terms of picking a role. His faith in himself and Columbia Pictures and Fred Zinneman's faith in him netted him an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, one of eight awards won by From Here to Eternity.By the way Sinatra credited both Lancaster and Clift in helping him through this film as a dramatic actor. Lancaster and Sinatra didn't inhabit the same Hollywood orbit, but they remained friends for life. The same could not be said for Clift. Allegedly, some five or six years after From Here to Eternity and after Monty Clift's automobile accident while shooting Raintree County, Clift at some party at Sinatra's made a drunken pass at one of Sinatra's retainers. That got him kicked out of Sinatra's circle permanently.In fact From Here to Eternity was also the Best Picture of 1953, with Zinneman getting his second Best Director Oscar in a row after the one he took home in 1952 for High Noon. Donna Reed won for Best Supporting Acress. Burt Lancaster and Montgomery Clift were both nominated for Best Actor, but split the vote allowing William Holden to win for Stalag 17. Another great acting job itself. And Kerr was up for Best Actress, but lost to Audrey Hepburn for Roman Holiday.From Here to Eternity is a film loaded with good actors in small roles who got their first notice in this film. Ernest Borgnine, Robert J. Wilkie, Claude Akins, Jack Warden, Mickey Shaughnessy, all play various soldiers and each one is memorable. Especially Borgnine as the vicious sadistic sergeant of the stockade.TV's Superman was in From Here to Eternity also. George Reeves who was looking to escape the typecasting from Superman has a part as another sergeant who warns Lancaster about Deborah Kerr. He gave a fine performance, but most of it wound up on the cutting room floor. That would have unforeseen tragic consequences.This is not any kind of glamorous army. These people are all too real and not very noble. The original novel was toned down quite a bit for the screen. But when the attack on Pearl Harbor comes, the men rise to the occasion, do their jobs in a more than competent manner and led by Burt Lancaster in that company. It's these men who won that war in the Pacific and the one in Europe as well and From Here to Eternity despite the less than noble portrayals of them as individuals is a great tribute to them as a team.",10,112,143,2 September 2005
Atonement," Telling A Vicious Tale
","Some of the best elements of Wuthering Heights and The Children's Hour are combined in Atonement to make a really fine romantic film. It's been nominated for several Oscars and is certain to take home something from this year's Academy Awards ceremony.James McAvoy and Keira Knightley are a pair of fateful lovers who novelist Ian McEwen no doubt was inspired by Charlotte Bronte. McAvoy is the son of the housekeeper and Knightley is to the manor born. They do so look like Heathcliff and Cathy as performed so many years ago by Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon. But they've got a young Mary Telford in their midst from The Children's Hour. Class distinction robbed Olivier and Oberon of earthly happiness, but in Atonement it's a terrible and vicious lie, told by a young girl with too vivid an imagination. Saiorse Ronan plays Knightley's younger sister who tells the vicious tale. I can't recall another instance where a juvenile performer has been up for a Best Actress Award. Usually those are confined to the supporting categories. But young Ms. Ronan may just pull it off at this year's Oscar.The main parts of the story take place in the United Kingdom from the late Stanley Baldwin years to the beginning years of World War II, of Dunkirk and the Blitz. Romola Garai does a fine job in portraying a slightly old version of Ronan's character. The sets and the cinematography showing the period have gotten deserved nominations.The coda to the story is provided at the very end by Vanessa Redgrave in today's times. She's become a very successful novelist now and she brings the audience through a television interview the rest of the story. Her portrayal of a dying woman who now wants to make some amends is so moving I am mystified why the Academy voters overlooked her in the Supporting Actress category. There is no way anyone will leave the theater with a dry eye.While it's still in theaters don't miss Atonement.",9,9,15,18 February 2008
The Godfather," The Don And His Sons
","My nephew who is all of 17 told me in no uncertain terms that movie making with him starts with The Godfather. He doesn't believe anything made before it is of any great merit. For him The Godfather is like The Birth of a Nation. All three of The Godfather films can bear viewing over and over again. Mario Puzo created such compelling characters and Francis Ford Coppola brought them to life so vividly that you just get sucked in permanently. Like that other mammoth novel about a period, Gone With the Wind, Mario Puzo was like Margaret Mitchell in that there was no way he could top himself after the book was published.Anyone steeped in organized crime history will know a lot about who is being alluded to in all of the Godfather films. Case in point, Alex Rocco who plays the minor character of Moe Green who takes it upon himself to slap Fredo Corleone around. He's also got a cash flow problem at the casino he's running. One would have to have been living on another planet to not know he was referring to Bugsy Siegal.The Godfather story begins at the end of World War II where Marlon Brando rules the roost as Vito Corleone head of one of the large crime families. Two sons, James Caan (Sonny) and John Cazale (Fredo) are in the business and the third Al Pacino (Michael) has just come back from the war a decorated hero. The occasion is the gathering of the clan and friends for daughter Talia Shire (Connie) to Gianni Rizzi (Carlo Russo). All the characters are marvelously introduced and the plot situations laid out beautifully.Marlon Brando who apparently decided that what George C. Scott did was so good in refusing the Oscar for Patton decided to do him one better and send up a bogus Indian princess to tell why. Despite that bit of cheek Brando certainly deserved an Oscar for his performance. Don Vito is compelling as criminal and family man. Brando might have been lucky though in that Al Pacino who really is the main character in all three Godfather films was nominated in the Supporting Actor category.In fact Pacino was nominated with James Caan and Robert Duvall who plays Tom Heggen the family lawyer/consigliere and Brando's adopted son. That three way tie guaranteed the Oscar for Joel Grey in Cabaret with Eddie Albert being nominated for The Heartbreak Kid as the fifth. They're all great, but Pacino should have been in The Best Actor category.Singer Al Martino plays Johnny Fontaine who if you didn't know that this was Frank Sinatra again you'd have to have been living on another planet. In fact the identification is made complete by the fact that Martino sings I Have But One Heart at the Corleone wedding which was an early Sinatra hit. Sinatra was not happy with The Godfather and broke off relations with Martino and with Richard Conte who plays Don Barzini one of the other Mafia Dons. Part of the underside of the Sinatra legend is worked into the plot as well.The images and dialog of The Godfather have entered into our popular culture. The horse's head in John Marley's bed, the cryptic gangster dialog of speaking of an 'offer he can't refuse', or 'Lucabrazzi sleeps with the fishes' is all stuff we remember forever after seeing the film.The key scene I think in The Godfather is between the retired Brando and Pacino who has taken over the crime family. Brando isn't happy about the road he took for success, but it's what was available to him. He hoped that Pacino could have stayed out of the family business and had a clean life. It wasn't to be, but maybe the next generation. I think it's beautifully played.In fact it's all beautifully played.",10,7,11,9 March 2008
