Marie Antoinette," utter dog-pile!
","I only made it through the first 15 minutes of this film before I felt so nauseated, I had to delete it... (this is why people bootleg... maybe if there would be some good movies out there to buy, and a better distribution network in place).What's up with the psudo-80's sound track? is that supposed to be 'kewl' for the younger generation? *gag* The Cure, Bow wow wow, Aphex twin, Squarepusher, the Strokes, New Order???? PLEASE! In a period film? Might as well make a movie about ELVIS and put music from WHAM and Janet Jackson in it.. come on!! After fast forwarding past the lame intro, I felt like stabbing a rusty knife in my ear when the electric guitars kicked in during the first coach scene... I made it about as far as seeing her naked butt (probably a stand in).. then I wanted to go drown myself in a pool of my own vomit! Pathetic excuse for a movie.. can I get the last 20 minutes of my life back PLEASE!? THANK GOD I Didn't PAY MONEY FOR THIS WRETCHED PIECE OF DOG PILE!",1,12,22,29 January 2007
