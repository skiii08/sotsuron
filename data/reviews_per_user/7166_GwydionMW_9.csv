First Man," Showing the real perils of spaceflight
","I very much liked this film.Unlike 'The Right Stuff' and even 'Apollo 13', this got across the extreme dangers of space flight. That even when everything seems fine, there is a lot to worry about. That included the clanking, vibration and alarming noises for take-off.And showing the actual deaths.People wanted Armstrong to be more colourful. But as far as I know, he wasn't. Good to have a movie that respected the facts.You also see the stress endured by the wife of an astronaut - mostly given much less emphasis.",9,2,5,17 March 2019
The Finest Hours," Dull start, and then it gets better
","Hard to understand why we got 15 minutes of a very ordinary romance, before we got to the substance of a ship in peril.If it needed to be included at all, it could have been done as a flashback, after we know that the man's life is at risk.Till almost the end, one can not be sure who will live, or if anyone will survive.Once it gets going it is rather good, showing real-life perils.",7,0,0,21 May 2019
3:10 to Yuma," Pretty absurd
","It opens with a rancher having his barn burn by the henchman of a man he owes money to. The henchman shows his face, which is absurd since he could be arrested for arson.Then we switch to a gang led by Russell Crowe, who looked and sounds much too posh to be a Wild West outlaw.From there it gets worse. They are after a stagecoach which they know carries a Gatling gun. They have cleverly set up a way to stop it â€“ but decide for no good reason to first chase it and get shot at, with predictable losses.The main part of the action is escorting the prisoner to the 3:10 to Yuma Prison. He kills one of the escort, and they don't make the obvious response of killing him. Then another and the same again.I won't give away the ending, but I found it the silliest twist of all.",4,1,2,23 August 2016
The Hunger Games," Death and Sympathy
","This was a much better film than I expected. What's notable is how the heroine shows sympathy all along. You also see the hideous smugness and lack of sympathy of most of the elite, with their intensely artificial garments and make-up. The main exception is the former Champion from District 12, who is presumably drunk most of the time because he's haunted by memories of what he had to do to win.What's interesting also is that the public turn out to prefer a sympathetic individual to the usual callous-for-a-good-cause individual of most 'action films'.",8,0,4,27 January 2013
"I, Robot"," An intelligent thriller
","The visuals are excellent, with old and new robots clearly distinct. It does pick up themes which Asimov explored, even though the specific explanation is a new variant.I was glad to see Dr Susan Calvin left pretty much as Asimov conceived her. Though this may be because there is a segment of the audience that would object to anything overtly sexual between a black man and a white woman. As it is, the hostility of some reviewers is hard to understand unless they are upset by the overturning of racial hierarchies.I am glad to see it doing well, and hope that more of Asimov's work gets Hollywooded. What about The Currents Of Space, say?",Null,0,0,10 August 2004
The White Ribbon," An insult to the audience
","A film that raises a mystery is supposed to resolve it. This rubbish fails to do.There are a series of violent incident. Why? We never learn.In as far as there is an explanation, at least two persons are acting quite independently, in a village that has previously been peaceful.It is supposed to foreshadow Nazism. Which is absurd: the war produced fascism or similar movements in all countries that took part in it. Fascism was invented in Italy, and before Hitler came to power there were similar movements in all Eastern Europe apart from Czechoslovakia. And in the USA and Britain, similar movements maybe failed because the New Deal and National Government did similar things without breaking with conventional politics.It is also slow and dull, or at least I found it so.",3,3,11,28 February 2017
Joker," Is the joke in Joker a joke on those who think it is real?
","All through, I wondered just how this incompetent inadequate man could suddenly become a criminal mastermind.A random murderer, yes. You just need a gun and to choose targets who don't suppose anyone would be crazy enough to kill them.But how can be transform into Batman's worst foe?Given some games with what's real and what's not, I wondered if perhaps the film is actually saying none of it really happened. All the fantasy of a man in a mental asylum. (Which has been done, or similar, in other films.)Which would make it a nice spoof for all those who've been delighted by it. You have been mocked and don't yet realise it.",2,2,7,20 March 2020
Cube," Fascinating, but with a smart-ass and silly ending
",I found this film gripping and fascinating.A mystery and clues that emerge along the route.You see the dynamics of the group and how it evolves.How do people behave under pressure? But I had also expected that there would be some sort of coherent explanation.At the end it just ends and you are supposed to see that as clever.Really there is no explanation.Just a hint of an absurd answer which It spoiled my belief in the story as a whole.I did not believe it.Stylish but in the end incoherent.,6,1,2,17 August 2014
Warcraft," Too much the video game
","The male orcs are never very believable.The female orcs are given sensible dimension: you could believe they were real humanoids. Not the males.Also the male human actors were never very convincing in their roles.Odd, since the females including the half-orc did work.Quite good special effects.",6,0,1,10 May 2017
