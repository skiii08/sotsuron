Despicable Me 2," A hilarious and happy story of love in all its forms, simply the 'Wrath of Khan' of its own franchise.(10/10) SPOILERS.
","Rarely can critics ever enjoy agreeing with every creative decision taken in a film. This is such a film, superior to its original in spirit and verve. A social phenomenon to uplift a depressed world, DM2 is a surefire babysitter/adult-sitter for years to come. My one quibble is its over-expressed toddler-friendliness, something the directors themselves found challenging to comply with.DM2's music and visuals are particularly delightful. For instance, its 'Gangham-Style' dancing (by lipstick-tasered victims) are just hilarious homages to Chuck Berry's guitar-playing and John Travolta's dancing, elevated to a perfect blend of homage, music, and joy, thanks to megastar franchise composer Pharrell Williams. One half of The Neptunes, Williams wrote charting hit 'Happy' for Gru's DM2 montage; it's now available online as 24hoursofhappy-com.The same creative team is back from DM1, ensuring a sensitive sequel tonal change. 'It's pretty clear that by the end of DM1, Gru was no longer a villain', claims co-director Chris Renaud, so DM2 concerns itself with the sacrifices of matured fatherly love, beyond merely falling in love with one's children, as Gru had in DM1. In the process, Gru (Steve Carrell) undergoes emotional changes needed to complete his family.Disappointingly, 'fans' of the original charge that DM2 has 'no plot' since it's missing 'serious villains'. In not getting this sequel, they disregard Gru's character arc (business losses, a mysterious villain, the Anti-Villain League, and the minion-nappings) as plot. The prologue comes out the gate like a serious James Bond film, although the film soon begins to wink; by the first act all pretense to real danger is dropped, and the tone refocuses on Gru's put-upon fatherhood. The Disappointed Brigade can therefore be referred to Megamind(2010) and The Incredibles(2004), both of which specifically explored villain battles. The DM franchise explores the reformation of a self-centered guy (villain) via 3 little girls once he began to love them as they needed. Steve Carrell himself is quoted about the future of Gru: 'You want this character to soften up and that there would be just this sense of joy and love at the end.....As crazy as this character sounds, and diabolical and mean and awful, there's a humanity to him that comes out in little bits....that's what drew me to (this franchise)'.DM2 cheekily lays bare the challenges of mature dating, especially when pushed by daughters. Both Margo (Miranda Cosgrove) and little Agnes (voiced again by exuberant child actress Elsie Fisher) enjoy being daddy's girls, but Agnes in particular senses the costs of missing a mom. The minions are an insufficient substitute.DM3 is rumored to be a minion origin feature, but DM2's minions are still a mysterious bunch of naughty little yellow goofballs serving as Gru's amoral army ('humans are just meat to them', explains chief animator/co-director Pierre Coffin). Not actually evil, just dopey, mischievous and always squabbling, they're meant to remind us of annoying but lovable little brothers. Once co-writers Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio hit upon DM2's plot to turn them truly evil via a secret formula, their Dr-Jekyll-and-Mr-Hyde scenario was gleefully animated with an insider's grin, adapted from old-school (Looney Tunes) short Hyde and Hare(1955)), mashed-up with Rocky and Bullwinkle's Metal Munching Mice(1960), Season2.Since the main plot revolves around mysterious minion-nappings, the sequel's villainy pivots on what the yellow goofballs turn into: purple, hairy, knuckle-dragging, underbite-sporting, vacuous versions of themselves who cannot speak. Evil minions only do a hilariously dumb, sharp 'Baaa!' screech, pointedly recalling the last scene from Invasion of the Body Snatchers(1978).Pierre 'say-'Casket'-instead' Coffin and Chris Renaud, the franchise's sweet co-directors so far, were understandably heavily influenced by cartoon classics: Dripalong Daffy(1957)'s Nasty Canasta is the unacknowledged inspiration for the 'tough homber' villain El Macho (sizzling drink, gurgle-gurgle, 'Bartender, bartender, WHERE's MINE?'), with added 'lucha-libre'/Nacho Libre(2006) Mexican wrestling costuming. Renaud's minion-compressor idea for DM2's jar-headed minion was borrowed from Hillbilly Hare(1950); Coffin's fruit-basket minion is a spoof of 1940s popular South American songstress Carmen Miranda; the Afro-wearing beach bartender spoofs Isaac(Ted Lange) from The Love Boat(1977-1987), and the white-overalled, white-jacketed group of minions are spoofing marshmallow 1990s boy-band All For One, whose chart-topping 'I Swear' lyric is cheekily minionised by Coffin as 'underwear'. Last, but not least, the film's wildly energizing closing track YMCA is a minion makeover of THE Village People perennial 1979 hit.Much of the humour is realised with group scenes sporting 'easter-eggs' in their backgrounds. They begin at Agnes' birthday party (a tormenting little boy is re-educated by a clever little girl, and a stumbling woman gets plus-conked with a game ball). Later there's an easily missed 22nd fart gun salute; sundry mock Minion-on-Minion-violence which once gets hilariously out of hand in a vat; and evil minions gnawing each other in cages. Even the climactic villain scene sports an 'easter-egg' homage to director Chris Renaud's home townall very funny.But there are two fall-down-funny jokes I'll never forget: little Agnes' interpretations of Gru's wild pantomime for pushy neighbor Jillian(Nasim Pedrad), and the entry of two incognito minions to the evil lair using nothing but a raspberry-enhanced password. This latter one is funniest to me personally for a real-world analogue that works equally well! The parental dating subplot is also riotous, satisfyingly skewering society's shallow and obnoxious 'bodyproud' women who are only successful in the confines of their own noggin'. DM2 gives its Shannon(Kristen Schaal) character the right-royal 'Weekend at Bernie's(1989)' treatment: she's flopped upside down, legs splayed apart, her indignities fully deserved.A final word about homage: DM2 draws from pop culture going back 60yrs, even referencing Toy Story(1995) itself in Act1, yet it's all done with love and understanding: its homages are 'organic' (arising naturally). Unlike other functionally lesser Hollywood creatives, DM2's storytellers never rip off decades of work by others calculatingly. Instead, DM2 so bristles with finely observed behavior in this story of love in all its forms, that it might be termed the Wrath of Khan(1986) of its own franchise.(10/10)",10,1,1,15 January 2014
Antz," How to reorganize a Marxist superorganism from the inside. 9/10. Spoilers.
","Animation has become the last vestige of grand storytelling for filmmakers. In its rush to satisfy the growing legions of ADD-sufferers (dismissive audiences with short attention spans), live action may have lost the battle to take its time. Nothing is `real' to us anymore, especially not the `reality shows' that cheat and corrupt their way through the use-and-abuse of idiots hoping for their 15mins of fame. Frankly, this is what postmodernism really gets us.Substance (mental infrastructure) is being missed. Even adults need substantive messages, but their suspicions over who's doing the telling have allowed them to reject everything, throwing  the proverbial baby out with the bathwater. That's postmodernism, the rejection of past perceptions. However, postmodernism has to insist that there IS no baby, and I have to argue that's going too far (it's one tiny step away from nihilism). So now I have a saying: Inclusivity is the baby--postmodernism is the bathwater.The full deconstruction of everything society achieved in the past to start again from scratch, nihilism, is what General Mandible(Gene Hackman), the dictator of Antz(1998) wants to pursue, despite his ant-society's otherwise well-oiled albeit hierarchical (repressive) machine. Equating an ant colony with caste-system human societies now seems obvious; although ants have long been used as metaphors for human foibles/societal ills ever since the Greek slave Aesop won his freedom by entertaining nobles with his fables in the 6thC BC (A Bug's Life(1998) was developed from Aesop's fable The Ant and the Grasshopper).Obviously, the strength of this `kids' film' lies in the story. As the directors say, their movie is about an ant world, it's not a dime-a-dozen story about some hero.There's so much petty injustice in Antz society that, not surprisingly, they turn to a Marxist model (a hierarchy easily accommodating their pre-existing caste system). The worker-ants' cry of `It's the workers who control the means of production' now sounds like a Pythonesque pi**take of Karl Marx. The mantra is correct, but it's just so anachronistic!Antz's canny political plot is related through a neurotic uber-individualist ant, Z(Woody Allen). Z and the plot so thoroughly cover the bases of an individualist manifesto that much of Woody's real-life career wind has been taken out of his sails. Antz(1998) single-handedly expresses most of Woody's lifelong concerns by giving him the platform to be his own purist. This may account for his subsequent career-lows Smalltime Crooks(2000) and Hollywood Ending(2002). In fact, Antz(1998) is a partial remake of Woody's Play It Again Sam(1972), and of It Happened One Night(1934) for the roadtrip segment.Antz's `original' charm is undeniable. It's full of ironic/cutesy normalizations of rather terrifying ant-behaviour into our human sphere--eg the ants' regimented dancing, aphid-butt beers, flying insects representing higher social class, and insects that talk back after decapitation.The funniest scene comes during Weaver(Sylvester Stallone)'s nervous midnight argument with Z: `Do you know how much trouble you can get into just for listening to someone trying to impersonate a soldier?!' -causing rubbernecking ants in the surrounding sleeping quarters to slam their heads back down.I also loved Guantanamera, deconstructed as both uber-elevator-music, as well as a theme for Z's romantic interludes.Mandible wouldn't be much of a threat if he didn't covet wars, so Antz doesn't look half bad as a war movie/ripoff of Starship Troopers(1997). The crucial depiction of Barbatus (a very tender Danny Glover) dying on the battlefield powerfully reminds us of the brutality of war. Barbatus became the most-liked character with child-age audiences (and me!).Of course it's the generals who plan the wars, but it's the troops (or `troop')--and civilians in the middle--who get killed. Actually, harming civilians is necessarily more despicable, not only because soldiers have better protection, but because `collateral damage' makes logical justification for war that much more elusive. That's always been the case.At best, war is conducted with smart bombs programmed by dumb intelligence. At worst, war is pointless man-made disaster, the outcomes of which then start off a new cycle of tit-for-tat on top of old, unsettled tit-for-tat. Warfare, except as a last resort, was opposed by no lesser a satirist than Francois Rabelais back in 1534 (Gargantua's speech). We don't need warfare, or their apologists, 500yrs later!In Antz, Gen.`Man-Deeb-lay' sends his troops--those who are loyal to his queen instead of him--on a suicide mission. It's on this issue that I fault Darnell & Johnson, for never explaining what drove the General--he just seems to crave a colony without `incompetent' workers. Worse, we have no backstory for Col.Cutter(Christopher Walken)'s  `fearsome' reputation (he'd been redesigned from just an assassin sidekick to Mandible). All this leaves a lotta plot holes.However, my favourite scene shows Gen.Mandible in a simply stunning piece of spindoctoring. Although we don't know what drives him (other than putated madness), we see he's an old hand at Orwellian doublespeak worthy of any Hitler/Stalin. It's frightening how speedily he turns a hostile crowd by augmenting and reinterpreting holes in their knowledge; highlighting how easy it is to brainwash people who aren't able to cross-check the information they're fed by their unimpeachable authorities.Eric Darnell & Tim Johnson's technique of changing the story as new ideas arose from animators' improved techniques is probably responsible for this ant-world-movie being generally preferred to Disney's schmaltzier effort the same year (A Bug's Life). Although the 3yr-long revisions exhausted writers Todd Alcott + Chris & Paul Weitz, they allowed the story to incorporate homage touches to other movies, a practice well-established by PDI's Shrek(2001).PDI's Antz(1998) also resurrects Stallone's comedy reputation after my beloved Oscar(1991). Stallone's ant soldier Weaver is a perfectly well-adjusted tough-as-nails softie. Weaver was given exactly the right amount of screentime for us to grow very fond of him, unlike J-Lo, who plays Azteca merely prototypically.SPOILER:-------------------------------------------------------------- The proverbial happy ending rankles a bit for those of us who expected more philosophical debate; but the final message that all dictators must be resisted is good enough for anybody.(9/10)",10,0,1,1 May 2003
Deja Vu," Time-paradox hybrid drama bests them all.
","DéjàVu is one of those movies that require repetitive viewings to accept. It's internally consistent so long as we're comfortable with time-paradoxes and are prepared to allow two (major) conceits. It's executed extremely well, including its satisfying ending. Above all, this police-procedural-come sci-fi love story is a nod/thank-you to all the cops who've ever wished they could prevent man-made disaster instead of counting the bodybags. With time-travel, if necessary.Things begin with a 'wink'. Since studio logos sometimes now herald a movie's plot, Bruckheimer's logo animation performs an act of déjà-vu itself: it rewinds, and restarts to end correctly on the lightning striking the tree. The action opens mysteriously, portended by music. The eerie score deepens the tension by intercutting the confusing ferry montage with the Beach Boys. The pointed use of 'Don't Worry Baby' was a stroke of genius, especially when reprised at the end for a different meaning. Frequency(2000)'s similar musical flourish wasn't as successful. I mention Frequency(2000) for both Jim Caviezel and Brian Greene(V--IMDb)'s dual-duty involvements.There is careful plot seeding, eg as Agent Minuti(Matt Craven)'s cellphone rings inside a bodybag. The director's commitment to stunt realism is equally impressive; he shows real burning (stunt-)people, trained by the Picernis: both Charlie and son Chuck Jr are 'Die Hard' &'Lethal Weapon' mavens. While non-gratuitous, the depicted bombing is tough to watch, but it's vital for our emotional investment. Question: why was the FBI looking for Minuti instead of Doug Carlin, the Oklahoma expert? Tony Scott again made the right choice having Claire Kuchever's father(Enrique Castillo) imploring Carlin that 'I need her to matter to you'. The movie needs her to matter to us also. Lacking this connection, Time After Time(1979)'s biggest flaw was that women just couldn't connect to Mary Steenburgen's character, but by BTTF III(1990) she was much more emotionally available.Despite being horribly brutalised, the perfectly-cast Claire(Paula Patton) turns out to be as brave as the hero. She's very relateable as a 21stC damsel 'in need of a vice', especially when her heart is breaking in the rescue boat, realising Doug(Washington)'s sacrifice, then being given a second chance she couldn't explain.Denzel is again charming and cheeky as the plot veers into technothriller territory. His first contact with the time-portal team is a giggle; his face communicating 'YEAH(no sh!t; and) OK!(that you'll look into it)'. The romance is pitch-perfect, eg as Doug lovingly puts Claire in his car to warm up. Jim Caviezel, nicknamed JC 'also' for having been 'the lead' in Passion of the Christ(2004), is a suitably intense patriot. He sheds a Christlike tear as he tries to explain his deadly commitment, but it's hard to see what Oerstedt's 'date with destiny' is. DéjàVu provides a hero-vs-antihero shared destiny within the original universe where the ferry explodes, and presumably it's this struggle that Oerstedt is trying to 'win', but why is he experiencing déjà-vu? The logical links of this single element are weak, so we don't 'get' the violent patriot. We're left disappointed by his expectation to die in the explosion, too.The technobabble is a dull roar, yet the 'digital recreation' sounds fraudulent. Not only is the time-window computationally prohibitive(impossible), but its POV detail needs an in-situ camera, not 'up-to-four satellites'. So this reeks of a movie cheat using the cameraman's footage masquerading as technobabble. Carlin's right, the POV(and audiofeed!) remain unexplained. Originally Tony Scott's idea, the writers' insistence on the time-window made it a little more palatable, but not much.The hysterical and hyped action banter during the Hummer chase scene is the movie's lowest point; it's there to distract us from questioning the total absence of any technological explanation for the goggle-rig whatsoever. It's pure cover-up.Scientists loathe Denny(Adam Goldberg)'s claim that 'Life, like time and space, is not merely a local phenomenon', because that's stolen from What the Bleep--Down the Rabbit Hole(2006), circling the drain of pseudoscience and parapsychology. Later, the plot changes Denny's mind for him with the now hollow-sounding excuse that he's secretly religious. Granted, as a co-protagonist, Denny's conceit WAS necessary if he was to help Carlin go back to save Claire. Carlin HAD to go back, because that's what completes the causality loop: once he first saw that leading 'U can save her' message in Claire's apartment, the loop was set. Such is the nature of plausible(!) time-paradoxes.However, if it's physically impossible to change the past, then NOTHING physical can go back; not even the piece of paper. Anything/anyone macroscopic(touchable) is just too big. So the creators overrode their own 'God's mind is made up about this' assertion with the transported note. This is the central conceit of the plot. They originally also intended hinting that God changed his mind (deleted scene--different weather in the other universe-branch), but this was abandoned as too obvious.The time-window is supposedly being generated by that particle accelerator, but there aren't (two)black holes surrounding it. They're needed to create an Einstein-Rosen bridge(wormhole) at both ends. Even if from another dimension, we'd still need to gravitationally attenuate such black holes--a science we haven't begun to dream. Black holes in Earth's vicinity (in either dimension) would cause Solar System misalignment, killing the planet and everything on it. So this capability would be much more tragic than just causing an EM-pulse that blacks out the Eastern seaboard. The technology is fanciful--but it sounds almost plausible.DéjàVu(2006) had to cheat, but we can just about fool ourselves. Happily the movie can be taken on many levels, its universality making it an instant classic. DéjàVu includes everyone except violent 'patriots', whose 'Hell-in-a-handbasket' destiny is contrary to a universe in which love and compassion crosses space-time. Its ultimate strength is in its wrenching conclusion so perfectly buttoned by the Beach Boys, telegraphing the movie's humanism about disaster. 'everything will be alright' because it's a branching universe, not a parallel one: BRIAN GREENE, the screenplay's 'God', changed his mind!(9/10).",9,1,2,2 February 2008
Star Trek," Heartless and humorless, Abrams devolves his frenetic pap into a shinier ripoff of Star Wars.
","To paraphrase Janet Maslin, a 1982 NY Times critic--Well, that's a lot LESS like it!At least JJ.Abrams hasn't killed, just insulted and brought low this great franchise, and outraged lifelong fans like me. His reboot is mere eye-bubblegum at best. Forgettable the minute it's over, nobody could discuss the plot at length just 1/2hr later.At worst, it devolves Star Trek into a shinier ripoff of Star Wars, in a transparent attempt to appeal to the masses.Once its predecessor ST-X:Nemesis(2002) broke the even-numbered-charm by losing money, Star Trek(2009)'s seven producers should've known better than to again invoke Romulan terrorism for a plot. Missing stronger plot ideas for Harve Bennett's prequel, they succumbed to repetition. Time-travel would conveniently acculturate the younger actors, so....we got what we got.We quickly lose the plot because action dominates (the film is unbalanced); time-travel and 'red matter' pragmatics are glossed-over for the novelty-seekers with no patience for science; the set-ups for location and discovery exposition are poor, eg when young Spock commandeers old Spock's ship or why old Spock unaccountably deals with 'red matter' himself; we're unprepared for Spock's venal marooning of Kirk ACCIDENTALLY on the planet where old Spock is also marooned, or for old Spock's ridiculous sighting of Vulcan imploding; plus cadet Kirk gets promoted embarrassingly quickly to Captain.Some discomforts are due to losses in editing, but not all. Beats like the marooning and the 'Centaurian slugs'(Ceti-Alpha eels) are carelessly borrowed from ST-II:The_Wrath_of_Khan(1982); 'shiny' elements are slathered on, as are all the imperceptibly-quick action scenes, matched by a deluge of unlikely success. Such pandering choices result in cinematic bubblegum, begun in the screenplay: according to ST-II:The_Wrath_of_Khan(1982) young Kirk wasn't a loser bad-boy, just a Lothario 'crazy for space'. In ST(2009) he's been rewritten as having abilities we don't see, and hunky enough to induce Capt.Pike (Greenwood) to become his overawed benefactor.Even worse, the severe dress uniforms, combined with the Iowa cop's Judge Dredd(1995)-look and ST-inappropriate attitude give Starfleet the feel of a fascist Death Star assembly.Did Star Trek deserve this claptrap? Abrams appears out of faith for the franchise, surreptitiously remaking it into Star Wars; but we can be equally angry at professional critics, whose job it was to pick such things up, and to consider that when fans 'smell horse-puckey, perhaps there's a pony in the barn'.This screenplay was of course written with George.W in office, when the revenge-seeking terrorist must've seemed irresistible for geeing-up audiences. Although that plot device can be--and in ST-II:The_Wrath_of_Khan(1982) ALREADY HAS BEEN--done well, its belaboring has also typically been at the root of several unpopular Star Trek movies. Abrams et al nevertheless felt the.....need to ramp-up audience dread with it, having the spouse-destructively stupid Nero (Bana, utterly wasted) riding a needle-fronted spaceship--a motif thoughtlessly stolen from 'Babylon-5'(TV), where it made sense.Thievery ISN'T homage.The dull score is forgettable, but irritating when its misplaced Chinese violin is found to be stolen from 'Firefly'(TV), to pull 'Browncoats'. Only the reworked ST:TOS end theme enhances/is enhanced by the nebulae and planetary visuals. The OPENING could've used that.I've sat with 3 audiences seeing it for the first time now. Two failed to laugh at the paltry jokes; the only titter was raised by Uhura's ridiculous and unexpected smooching of the Vulcan. Clearly these were fans who didn't know what hit them. Uhura(Zoe Saldana)'s unexplained relationship with Spock--now rewritten as the sexier one--becomes unintentionally funny; had this been an organic wink at Nichelle Nichols' historic interracial kiss with Bill Shatner, we'd have been pleased.Simon Pegg, too, creates a silly buffoon for Scotty that's nothing short of a 'crack in the Star Trek canon'(Scott Weinberg). It undercuts the kindly engineering geek that Jimmy Doohan spent decades crafting, revealing an uncaring disrespect for Roddenberry's vision itself.Pegg's unwelcome postmodernist characterization adds another unwelcome flourish with a JarJar Binks-ripoff sidekick, who has no lines, but annoys both 'Scotty', and us. This must be the filmmakers' failed rework of Gerrold's tribbles.Winona Ryder is missing gravitas--and screen time--as Spock's mother Amanda. Her death is unmissed, except by John Cho's Hikaru Sulu, whose powerful reaction shot isn't enough.Only Zachary Quinto (Sylar from 'Heroes'(TV)) has imbued his performance with many of Nimoy's reticent nuances. Not surprisingly, Nimoy actually worked with him for weeks to achieve this, but it was the first honest work I could see in the film.At least the writers knew the lore. I enjoyed their incorporation of Kirk's middle-name into his birth and that it was originally his Starfleet biological father who didn't 'believe in the no-win scenario'; as well as McCoy's acquisitions of his nickname and fear of transporters, etc. Lore maintenance is good, but its revamping goes wrong by imposing stolen elements purely for generic loser-appeal.Scott Chambliss' wonderful production design for the Enterprise interiors deserves special mention. His plexiglass and flexible spot-lamps are brilliantly new while reminiscent of ST:TOS. However we could've lived without the heavy girders, plumbing, and the ridiculous smelt-works locations, which borrow too much from ST:Enterprise.The third audience I sat with was the most animated, being an evening audience well-lubricated with champagne, but none of them had any exit opinions to offer either. Nobody clapped, like they had in 1982.We have an obligation to compare ST(2009) with the Trek features high-water mark, especially because Nick Meyer's ST-II:The_Wrath_of_Khan(1982) was itself a (second filmic) reboot that snatched franchise victory from the jaws of defeat. Unfortunately Bad Robot's frenetic bad-faith pap serves up only a calculated and insulting, empty version of Star Trek to its hopeful/thoughtful fans. We wonder, will Abrams 'learn by doing'? If this reboot garners newer generations AND future directors restore things to a less Fascist, truer Star Trek feel, then fine; otherwise all this action-ridden pap and ill-advised 'borrowing'.....won't have been worth it.(5/10)",5,14,23,9 May 2009
Fight Club," Stylish pitch-black comedy keeps winning die-hard sham-rager fans but is no answer to what ails them.
","'How many nihilists does it take to change a light-bulb?' '-Half.' (Gettit?) Fight Club(1999) is a highly stylised hybrid--a pitch-black comedy that's hard to like unless you're male, and (possibly) clawing your way BACK from the edge of abyss.It opens with a CGI-fly-past of firing neurons under the credits, suggesting what follows is caused by misfires in the protagonist's brain. But you miss that at first for all the uncharted territory.James Uhls' impressive screen adaptation continues Chuck Palahniuk's novel attempts to revolutionize men's views of their place in first-world-societies where caveman sensibilities are literally no longer required.Tyler Durden(Brad Pitt) characterizes our generation in one of his early Fight Club welcome speeches: 'We're the middle children of history--we have no Great War', meaning that men raised without brutality still crave it--and why so many of them eagerly join up. But Club(1999) delineates its message for just one gender, never pretending to speak for women: the narrator observes that before becoming yuppies, 'we used to read pornography': young girls were never so inclined.Nevertheless, it's frightening how many people the film appeals to. Fans over-enthuse, saying 'this is the BEST movie EVER'. Professional critics aren't so impressed. One courageous video & DVD guide claims that '...this appalling, grotesque, and interminable endurance-test is fairytale fiction for serial killers, imbeciles who succumb to road rage, and frustrated white guys--all the morons who seek excuses for their increasingly bad behavior and hair-trigger tempers'.This temper-thing in the psych business is called 'sham-rage' (or 'decortication' after the severing of the neocortex in 1948 experiments on pussycats)- www.emotion.caltech.edu/courses/ss140/April17-1.pdf. The 'misfire' in Jack's brain depicts such a neurochemical break.But maybe Jack(Ed Norton) and Tyler(Brad Pitt) have a point. To me, the movie is saying that 'frustrated' guys are really no good for women, because, frankly, they just don't want what women have to give. Such men might now want to bond only with each other, to satisfy ancient caveman instincts, which civilisation--and women--are trying to breed out of them.That's why Jack & Tyler's fight clubs quickly evolve into organised anarchism, and eventually nihilism--the wish to destroy all moral and social edifices: males are getting back to their roots.Having 'said' that, Fight Club(1999) tries to throw a lifeline to the seriously disaffected; but that lifeline falls on deaf ears. (*****Spoiler: The ending depicts Jack's retaking control from his 'teacher' by redefining his personal limits regarding violence. The protagonist successfully battles his delusion to finally regain himself. He has learnt better.*****) The 'nasty' existentialism of anarchism/nihilism still tends to appeal to young men, despite its dead-end logic. A recent email asked me whether I thought this 'philosophy of unreason' was a mental deficiency or a choice. I call it a deficiency, as Fight Club(1999) does; the question is only how permanent that is. It can be considered foolishness--which is unlearnable; or sociopathy--which isn't.It's nice to know even its proponents (like my email friend) think this 'unreason' is subject to cognitive override--choice--but why would anyone choose it unless their unreason validates some physiological syndrome? Anti-establishment anarchism was last big in the 19thC, having FIRST given rise to Machiavelli. During both periods it was a might-makes-right power struggle against ruling elites. We now think of these periods as callous, brutal and primitive, certainly not part of civilisation today. We expect 'civilians' to abide by higher universal standards of humanism. Clearly, blowing up buildings and bashing each other half to death is antithetical to that social contract.However, I do like the film's position that male bonding, with/without a sexual component, might be just what they need. During a bonding session with Tyler, as they consider Jack's heterosexual relationship, Jack admits, 'I can't get married; I'm a 30yr-old boy'--to which Tyler adds, 'We're a generation of men raised by women. I'm wondering if another woman is the answer we need'.This is gender politics; and Norton goes to great lengths on the commentary track to explain Jack's mistreatment of Marla (Helena Bonham-Carter) as symptomatic of Jack's social and mental incompetence. Misogyny itself, the male hatred of women, may be physiologically inspired in such boy-men struggling to behave civilly. Ancient reptilian brain-structures produce the primal urge to violence (ie just to feel alive), so fight-club violence might not be caused by 'social malaise' at all.I suspect this is the movie's--and novel's--most unpalatable basis, making Fight Club(1999) seem 'irresponsible' to its critics.We usually call reptilian brain-structures 'primitive' because except in lizards (hence 'lizard-logic'), they're buried deep in the brain, overlain by 'higher', mammalian brain-structures. Lifelong learning encapsulated in the neocortex of, say, pussycats, inhibits/overrides this reptilian dominance, but in some ('decorticated' pussycats or people) the process may be faulty, or just take too long. However if graduating beyond such lizard-logic (anarchist idiocy) takes 'fight-clubbers' most of their lifetime, then so be it--until then, such men are welcome to have s*x with each other.Fight Club(1999)'s main problem is that it stirs up the powerful philosophical issue of anarchism/nihilism, but leaves it unresolved, notably with its ending. The entire closing scene, including the bombing, is visually nebulous. Did all that happen, or was it just Jack's imagination? Comprehension is deliberately muddied by Jack's speedy recovery(!) from a fatal gunshot wound. Like many, I laughed at its absurdity.Yet the film's showmanship still wins new converts. It seems to set the benchmark for neocinema by demanding freeze-frame plus several viewings to build its enjoyment. Like Sixth Sense(1999), Club(1999) employs perception-shift for the lead character, but here it's integrated linearly to unfold the story. (In Sense(1999) the perception-shift is recursive- cf. www.cse.nd.edu/courses/cse233/www/lectures/ri.pdf OR http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/sicp/book/node15.html.)Club(1999) further winks at us with single-frame interjections of--supposedly--Tyler's full frontals throughout Jack's narration. They serve both as alerts to Jack's insanity, and as visual 'easter-eggs'.Other clever concepts are borrowed from social philosophy, eg the politics of rich women's fat-paranoia (soapmaking): true recycling, trés Soylent Green(1973).---END_OF_PART1---",7,7,18,15 September 2006
The Town," Oscar contender is Ben Affleck's second bite at a hometown magnum opus. Exhilarating and honest film about how children inherit the sins of their fathers
","We all know Affleck the actor.In his latest crowd-pleaser, and only the second feature he's directed, Affleck the actor limbers up like he's practicing Tai-Chi. He simply glides through his character Doug MacRay in The_Town(2010) like the hockey skater he is in real life, never breaking as his cameras shoot him unblinking through confession scenes.....daring himself repeatedly to spot past camera. Many good actors still can't do that (eg Javier Bardem, Eat_Pray_Love(2010)). According to IMDb, Affleck has '21 wins & 38 nominations' in addition to being an Oscar-winning co-writer of Good_Will_Hunting(1997), yet he's probably a much better director than that. It'd be critically blunt (and a little naive) to charge Affleck with lacking acting ability at this late stage.The real surprise is that he has a VOICE. Audiences can appreciate Affleck's contemporary-yet-timeless directorial themes of children inheriting the sins of their....parents (mother and father respectively, so far).For The_Town, he's attracted top-grade talent both in front and behind the camera---prime example being his Oscar-winning (There_Will_Be_Blood(2007)) cinematographer, now DoP Robert Elswit, whose fly-on-the-wall camera lingers in one scene on a fight, leaving the baby in the room to cry off-camera. Another throwaway beat was his filming the obstructed face of a coin-op laundry attendant, flagging that MacRay's inner focus is on something else. Audiences are charmed by the intimacies set up with such carefully casual imprecision amidst the bustle. Can anyone say 'Oscar'?MacRay/Affleck's divergent reactions to his two girlfriends in The_Town(2010)---his face captured by Elswit---reveal the wrung-out young lover struck by the wrong kind of sex---or life---he's having. Touches of Affleck's Holden McNeil from Chasing_Amy(1997) now show up in MacRay's confession to Claire (Rebecca Hall), as his romantic transition painfully crystallizes MacRay's inner shift from his 'Townies'.The wonderful Second Unit (Directors Alexander Witt and Dylan Tichenor, uncredited) also threw in everything from 10' hand-helds to helicopter shots, and zippy car-chase masters to explicate all the skittering vehicles. This eye for editing is obviously thanks to the talented Tichenor doubling as both SUD and film editor....another Oscar right there.The_Town's silence/feedback signals effectively squeal across the audience's distress over its violent robberies; Affleck and Aaron Glascock's sound design succeeds precisely because this technique is now so little-used.But a film that adorns MacRay's jailhouse visit of his father with real orchestral violins deserves serious kudos (another Oscar nom).Affleck's second bite at a hometown magnum opus boasts an amazing cast, a gift to fans of his universalist films. His leading ladies, especially the adaptable Ms.Hall, allow The_Town to sidestep the gender-challenged sins of most similar male-demog films. Titus Welliver ('local crime-fighter' Dino Ciampa) is still the camera's darling even minus his mo' from GBG(2007), but I'm craving more scenes of Ciampa's career.Pete Postlewaite looks haggard, which just hands Affleck a quip about 'Fergie''s features as an ex-boxer.However, as action fans are bound to complain, this isn't wall-to-wall adrenalin; it's a drama-thriller only seemingly full of heists. There are only three, so it effortlessly avoids The_Hurt_Locker(2009)'s episodic traps. Affleck, Peter Craig & Aaron Stockard's authentic screenplay adaptation of Chuck Hogan's 'Prince of Thieves'---about America's most bank-robbery-ridden square mile---brings Charlestown's 'Irish omerta' underworld richly to life. The action and drama are exquisitely balanced, and the film, thankfully, takes its own observations about generational criminality seriously.The narrative does editorialise towards the end, but with an exemplary pace and universal appeal, The_Town plays like a contemporary Shawshank.The pacing is so good because the director keeps most of his mysteries only for so long; the storytelling isn't manipulative (overly reliant on revelations). Affleck gives us enough information so we're unworried by unanswered questions, and his hints advance the plot. For instance, we know MacRay left that note for the FBI, but FBI SA.Frawley (a too greasy Jon Hamm) then passes it off onto Claire's loser lawyer---producing the biggest laugh of the film.In homage to Yves Simoneau's 44_Minutes(2003) (true story fictionalised as Heat(1995)), Affleck climaxes the film with a realistic/exhilarating street shootout, with innocent cars driving in the police's line-of-sight. I don't know HOW LONG I've craved such a realistic GSW, but Affleck delivers an amazing smashed jaw effect in the hail of bullets. His well-adjusted action even guarantees some ironic visual comedy, as first a little boy, then a lone cop in a black-and-white get alternatively mesmerised/gobsmacked by a carload of bank-robbers in creepy nun drag.This type of organic (unforced) gentle humour turns out to be one of the best things about the film. Affleck's comedy is situational, logical and fresh, and always a surprise. It's wonderful to sit amongst an audience whose peals of well-tracking laughter release all their stress. Tongue-in-cheek, Affleck deftly has MacRay utter incognito concern for his robbery victim, then has Claire let him off the hook with 'It wasn't your fault'---when it literally was.The clever director has learned lessons from his prior success: this time Affleck's prologue contains minimal sombre narration. There are no opening credits, but Affleck's gravelly voice does its job admirably. His brogue is Bostonian; perhaps he plumbed actual memories for Jem Coughlin(Jeremy Renner)'s pistol-whipping his surrogate brother MacRay to stop him leaving his criminal niche. Astonishingly, AO.Scott (NY-Times) finds this 'Townie' relationship not atavistic ENOUGH.Affleck has even stronger observations about neighbourhoods. What MacRay does to the local crime boss still trying to rule him through his 'lovely new girlfriend' and his father Stephen(Chris Cooper, looking in his single scene every bit the Walpole lifer he plays) is a lesson to all victims of pyramid schemes.Naturally, critics are now comparing Affleck to Clint Eastwood, for Eastwood's somewhat similar directorial road, and Mystic_River(2003). And yet I doubt audiences will buzz about Town(2010) as they had over Inception(2010). This is the more honest/satisfying film, but it's not terribly escapist, concluding that 'No matter how much you've changed, you still have to pay the price for what you've done'.(10/10)",10,3,7,7 November 2010
Gone Baby Gone," Answer lies in what happened to the Australian (Aboriginal) 'Stolen Generations'. What is it that the road to hell is paved with, again? WARNING: SPOILERS.
","When you're a novice director, it helps to have an ex-studio honcho help you. Co-producer Alan Ladd.Jr had variously headed up Fox, MGM/UA, and his own The Ladd Company. However, a film still needs a strong screenplay......and the rest. GBG(2007) delivers all that at virtually stratospheric gravitas level.Ben Affleck maintains a surprising pace in his directorial debut because he is both brave, and has a lot to tell. And maybe it's Ladd's influence, but GBG shows true 'vision': the film's style of telling suits its subject-matter, and it poses its clever ideas audience-inclusively, without sugar-hit/adrenalin/overly-emotive score manipulations. Giving people exactly (and only) what they want is pandering; whereas offering them brands of antisocial insanity becomes unworthy of distribution.Affleck certainly does not pander to anyone here. That was unlikely, since the Affleck brothers (as well as the original author) are all smart 'Southies' from Boston's working-class Dorchester, where GBG is set. The director was certainly 'writing what he knew' when he co-adapted the fourth of Dennis Lehane's pentology of private investigator novels with Aaron Stockard.The opening documentary montage imperceptibly blends Affleck's fictional scenes on the street, thanks to his deft directorial hand. Patrick Kenzie's morose narration sets a sombre tone of survival in this harsh world of scarred people; the (real) montage had revealed a shocking number of wheelchair-bound, accident-prone gunshot victims.The younger Affleck (Oceans' 11-13) is a revelation as the '31yr-old' PI, business-partnered with his live-in girlfriend Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan, Eagle Eye(2008)). Their relationship seems confusing until you realize that despite inexperience with serious missing persons cases, they're actually great at finding people desperate to disappear. So.....just like that, the writers turned their 'liability' into advantage.Kenzie's droning about the farcical police presence at the missing toddler's home cleverly draws us into his professional skepticism. Surprisingly, the police captain himself heads up the search. Capt.Doyle (the deeply trustworthy Morgan Freeman) promises dutiful police co-operation to these competing PIs by way of his detective Remy Bressant (Ed Harris).The plot races ahead, in keeping with the speed of recovery being of essence in kidnapping cases. Layers of the shocking truth begin to peel away with the discovery that Amanda's mother Helene (Oscar-nominated Amy Ryan) is extremely 'working-class', and is probably causally involved--as the intended target. Clever Kenzie misses nothing in his investigation of her, the local barflies, or Bressant.Within 3days the case unfolds to a shocking apparent result, but no body is found, despite Angie flinging herself into a quarryful of water to save the little girl. Unfortunately we're never allowed to appreciate Angie's true desperation, because it implied the deeper story, so her/extra scenes were dropped--unbalancing the PI duo.This reveals GBG's one flaw: Affleck's overeagerness to mire his audience.The nighttime quarry scene wasn't staged well enough to properly hint the plot. Deliberately unlit and haphazard, it forced us to catch sight of Angie too late for our emotional involvement. As McTiernan admitted about HIS similar-case Russian cook in Hunt_for_Red_October(1990), the 'seeding was frail'. Audiences should have kept emotional pace with Angie our co-protagonist--or else why have her--but the need to confuse us overwhelmed the young director. (Taking your audience out of the movie is NOT THE SAME as having them give up hope for the kidnap victim!)Nevertheless, Ben Affleck must be commended for his courageous choice of stalling the plot halfway. Of course, this occurs in Lehane's book, too, but Affleck is so confident that he has the film's second half return to the 'same' insoluble Dorchester despondency with Kenzie's morose narration--lulling the audience into a false ignorance.When the case re-ignites in a different direction, Kenzie can't resist walking alone into the home of a suspected paedophile. What happens next makes us question who, if anyone, should ever be allowed to carry a gun, yet some things still don't add up. Ever-vigilant, Kenzie drags his employer, little Amanda's uncle Lionel (Titus Welliver, he of the handlebar moustache), into the local pub for a confession.Lionel's revelations constitute Lehane at his best, as the avuncular alcoholic finally falls off the wagon. His dialogue just gets more powerful the longer Lionel talks, since the plot now raises the dilemma of 'mothercare' within harsh communities, when the mother is herself a product of generational poverty/neglect.Rabbit-proof Fence(2002) punched out Australia's similar history in this regard; GBG(2007) now raises/augments the argument by reminding us of the consequences even WHEN we're 'wise as serpents yet innocent as doves'.So it's breathtaking for a first-time director to tackle such a deep, structurally unusual film yet still get both story and execution close to perfect. GBG's vision and style, subcultural authenticity and devastating perspective make it far more deserving than the one Oscar nomination it failed to win. We are indebted to all three amazing writers; together they satisfyingly ask all the right questions, and galvanize the morose reality.Their gutsy movie pulls no punches depicting this situation's moral inertia, either. A lesser film might not have known how to finish, but GBG's ending was always anchored by the reveal of underbelly subculture remaining more-or-less the same. Despite the family upheaval, little Amanda still loses. The film's deepest indictment of underbelly mothercare is represented by Helene's neglectful ignorance of her daughter's doll's name. Throughout the movie we know it as Mirabelle from news reports, until the toddler corrects her stunned babysitter in the very last scene. Such powerful writing is due no doubt to Lehane's previous years as a counsellor of abused children.Everyone is superbly cast, but 'Taggart'(John Ashton, Beverly Hills Cop(1984)) steals the show for simply not aging in 23yrs!.....The unexplained lack of Oscars still bothers me. Perhaps GBG's audiences (and critics) became uncomfortable stuck in their moral muddle, plus angry over being deliberately mired by the director, but other than its 'obfuscation scene', GBG is pretty flawless. Thank you Afflecks, Lehane and Stockard, Alan Ladd.Jr, Jill Quigg, and Dorchester.(9/10).",9,0,0,10 January 2009
The Machinist," Never trust an insomniac.(6/10). Warning: MAJOR plot spoilers
","Because the movie opens with the assumptive objectivity of Trevor Reznik(Christian Bale)'s struggle with a corpse, I have always been suspicious of The Machinist(2004). One of its most preposterous elements is his attempt to first kill, then carry such a (literal) dead weight when he is so weak& emaciated he can hardly walk. Equally, he's still a smoker despite its known negative effects on weight and sleep.What follows is therefore my spoiler-house-of-cards for the very confused.'No-one ever died of insomnia' is a refrain that reminds us of Fight Club(1999)'s beginnings as well, and Trevor is equally psychotic. He too is paranoid and hallucinates an entire person into existence--about whom he then becomes entirely obsessive. But he starts from a bad place. Like Fight Club's Narrator/Jack, Trevor seems to have no family or friends, and is permanently sad, merely surviving his insomniac half-life. The steel-blue filter and eerie soundtrack add much to our impression of his depth of isolation. Trevor's 'needy'relationships with only two women he knows are inadequate, and he soon starts to verbally abuse his prostitute girlfriend Stevie(Jennifer Jason-Leigh), driving her from his life. Trevor isn't exactly a stable human: when confronted with his derangement, he throws a violent tantrum.His wild, obsessed rooting-around his own garbage and cupboards is already indicative of this, not to mention his 'forgetfulness' and need for Postits. But why does one of them actually question his identity? This hints at even deeper mental disintegration.Yes, he is 'f'king psycho', just as Stevie accuses, because he's hallucinated his swaggering 'friend' Ivan(John Sharian) into life, meaning no-one else in the machinist shop can see him; 'Ivan''s Firebird convertible is a phantom car; and 'Ivan' just won't stay dead: when Trevor tries to dispose of his body, the 'corpse' DISAPPEARS and 'Ivan' becomes Trevor's DISCOVERER instead.As with Fight Club, the protagonist's most threatening hallucination is actually his alter-ego!'Maria' the mother-figure waitress sadly is also a hallucination, telegraphed by 1) her collection of inanimate objects (the record-player, the glass bowl, the red clown)--which turn out to be Trevor's dead mother's; 2) the repeated clock readouts stuck on 1:30 whenever Trevor hallucinates (possibly the time of his hit-and-run); and 3) the airport reveal, when the waitress who'd been serving him all this time is unfamiliar. Like 'Ivan', there never was a 'Maria' working there.To our relief, there's a cascade of resolutions near the end. Starting with his screaming match with Stevie over the fishing photo, Trevor is forced to confront his isomorphism with the looming 'Ivan'. In confusion, he flees to his airport waitress 'Maria', who turns out to be someone else too. Actually, his perception of the unknown waitress is a good sign--his mind is starting to reintegrate/reconcile his hallucinations with the real world. Unfortunately he has another backwards-stumbling hallucination of 'Ivan' in the car park, stalking him to Trevor's own home, as 'Ivan' takes 'Nicholas' to his doom.Trevor apparently 'kills' 'Ivan' in vengeance, but as per the opening, 'Ivan' keeps remorphing, and the 'kidnapped' child is nowhere to be seen. In Trevor's tortured mind, SOMEONE bled to death on his floor, hence his need to bleach the grouting; but Trevor seems to be suffering classic fractured-world paranoid schizophrenia.Because of 'Ivan', Trevor's identity itself is in doubt, just as the Postit mooted, until he recalls WHERE he first saw 'Maria': in the final 7mins Trevor remembers the panicked mother running back to her run-over son who, we surmise, is the original 'Nicholas'. Trevor's overwhelming guilt and its brought-on insomnia-come-psychosis drove him to 1) emotionally identify himself with his child-victim; 2) subconsciously report his own year-ago hit-and-run, citing his OWN rego number as the vehicle that hit him in his present-day self-induced accident (supposedly to discover 'Ivan''s address).In the present, Trevor's bathtime commiseration to Stevie that 'It was my fault, I wasn't paying attention' is a Freudian-slip admission, rather than a falsehood about his deliberate'accident'. Stevie's automatic reaction, that 'hit-and-run drivers should be hanged' actually inspires Trevor's hangman game with himself. The iconic stick-figure is reinforced both by the graphics from the police report, and 'Nicholas'' Mother's Day card on 'Maria''s imaginary fridge.Trevor's memories of a childhood ride at the pier when his mother was still alive, are reconstructed by his sick mind as a present-day ride with 'Nicholas', full of terrifying (hallucinated) hangman displays. Taking a very similar photo of them as one of him and his mother exists in the family album, suddenly blurs hallucinated memory and present-day hallucination for Trevor. However, since the filmmakers never found a proper way to depict this blurring, we're left confused by the scene.Trevor's psychotic 'memory' is indeed playing tricks on him. His hallucinations throw up new situations and characters that are one-by-one revealed as imaginary. He finally redredges his incipient holiday drive in the Firebird, and realizes the cowboy boots were his too, a year ago. They remained among Stevie's clients' left-behind belongings: Trevor really had been 'one of (her) best clients'.During one last hazy recollection, to our surprise we resolve Stevie, laughing in the Firebird's front passenger seat, enjoying their holiday drive. Not sure if this is meant to imply any more than their longtime relationship, because had she been present and cognizant of his hit-and-run crime at the time, this interpretation's house of cards collapses.Machinist repeats Fight Club's theme of sleep-deprivation driving men to psychosis. Its plot is relatively straightforward once we (usefully) ignore the editor's sneaky corpse-dumping opening scene, which left us distrustful of an objective narrative. From then on, clues are laden everywhere.Finally, the reason Trevor won't be needing his security deposit back from his landlady is because he knows he's going TO PRISON. His decision to turn himself in for his real hit-and-run crime is going to be his Salvation--he'll no longer hide from his guilt. Now he just needs some SLEEP.",6,3,6,3 January 2008
Ratatouille," Anton Ego voices the best critique of a critic on record in this most adult-friendly Pixar Trek.(10/10)
","Ratatouille was forced to give a 'Quality Assurance guarantee' that this is '100% genuine animation-–No motion capture or any other performance shortcuts were used' when its rat-scurrying, soup-sloshing, and nose-twitching detail was found to be so terrific that some preview audiences thought it was done with motion capture.2008 saw Ratatouille(2007) rightfully win the Best Animated Feature Oscar (with noms for another 4) not only for its realistic motion/cartoonish character 3D animation, but because its modern fairytale storytelling prowess is of the caliber of Hans Christian Andersen. It's an instant classic.Unlike other Pixar instant classics, this one isn't really for littlies. Almost completely devoid of hyperbole or of overused conventions, Ratatouille's realism is a welcome gift for its patient adults. The double-hitter plot is about a talented rat discovering that his multiple roles make him robust, not a victim, and how mankind could accommodate other forms of life on a different scale/lifespan of existence--if we chose to.Ratatouille(2007) betters its direct competition--DreamWorks' heavily marketed Bee Movie(2007)--by combining a straight story about the human/animal contract with deeper pathos and allegory for human relationships. In Ratatouille we find human analogues to our most vexing relationships with our egos and authority figures.The 'better father' theme was previously explored in Finding Nemo(2003) and the (storytelling-wise) slightly clumsier Happy Feet(2006)--sorry George Miller--but those were aimed mostly at children. Ratatouille(2007) is squarely aimed at their parents, who may have been guilty of voicing opinions like the father rat's: 'We look after our own kind (because) the world belongs to our enemy', as they willingly created the insular communities that their unfortunate children would have to grow up in. This is the main reason for depicting the upward-looking, ready-to-move-out-of-home Remy as blue and cuter than his brutish, much uglier brown rat father. But let's not deconstruct too far.The question at the core of their cross-generational argument(s) has now been answered. In countries where women and minorities got the vote and access to good jobs, it's getting very difficult to sound mentally competent insisting that 'you can't change nature'. When endemic political advantage is cemented as 'nature' by both the culture and religion of the society in question, it is the job of the young to question that, because they have to inherit it. Ratatouille is brilliant at reminding such insular fathers that when they uphold this 'nature', they do it against their own children, keeping the parents' failure to get a better deal unchallenged.There is another powerful thread in Ratatouille, that of our social reconsideration for animal companions we'd normally revile for their surprising competitive success. In this, Ratatouille resembles Babe(1995), its most worthy filmic companion.The story ennobles all those who join the level of debate (compete) in their chosen profession by signifying that even if our world isn't set up to treat the truths of the politically unequal as real, eventually they will be heard. Eventually everyone has to accept change, because, as Ratatouille's wisdom is voiced by little Remy, 'change IS nature, dad, the part we can influence--and it starts as soon as we decide'. Humanity went to the moon only because we set ourselves the goal; 3D features happened only because Pixar 'reinvented the universe' (requisite technologies).The delicately withheld character of Anton Ego is a welcome instant archetype, perfectly named for being the quintessential self-satisfied pompous loner who needs his ego pricked. And so, in the most balanced comeuppance that any film can/has shown, Peter O'Toole's perfectly inflected critic is eventually reformed: 'In many ways, the work of a critic is easy. We risk very little, yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgement. We thrive on negative criticism which is fun....' (generally a male-specific cruelty Germans call schadenfreude; not all of us are like this) '....to both write and to read. But the bitter truth we critics must face is that in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is more meaningful than our criticism designating it so.' (The Brady Bunch wasn't TV's finest hour, yet millions grew up pining for their parents to be that cheesy.)It cannot go unobserved that 'Skinner' is a very UN-FRENCH name for Ratatouille's rampant but diminutive Frenchie. This is due to the film's dimorphous central caricature: while Ego is a goth-like emaciated tall guy more resembling the actual--very American--BF.Skinner (cf 'operant conditioning chamber'--Wikipaedia), the caricature's other half is a sight-gag on the so-called Skinner Box itself.Burrhus.F Skinner was probably behaviourism's most-reviled psychologist. His heyday accounts for the slightly 1950s look of Ratatouille's Paris. Prof Skinner's arguably overzealous positivism for empirical evidence was borne of his own 'Skinner Box' RAT EXPERIMENTS which made for his purely robot-like explanations of people. The film therefore pokes subtle fun at the scientist by having an ultra-short namesake stand ON the proverbial Skinner Box--downgraded to a step-ladder--to see. Interestingly, Skinner is further caricatured as a sellout chef.Ratatouille's cartoony humans are balanced out by their realistic motion, and by the breathtakingly detailed backdrops of Paris at its most beautiful.However the true beauty of Ratatouille is its ability to weave together so many threads into ostensibly just one story. This is the meat of storytelling, and in this instance, the high art of original writing. Both Remy's prologue with the violent little-old-lady (establishing his rat respect as a poison-checker), and Anton Ego's comeuppance in the epilogue add to the overall message of due respect for little Remy as The Best Chef in France.Ratatouille(2007) therefore deserves the highest popular and industry respect aside the original Babe(1995). The rug-puller truth for its critic was the same as for all of us: we're all human, even if some of us are less human than others.(10/10)",10,1,2,17 April 2009
Die Hard 2," The `Superbowl' of action movies-and superior to the original. 8.5/10. Spoilers.
","Released a mere 2yrs after the original and helmed by `fill-in' director Renee Harlin, Die Hard2(1990) simply exceeds the original in staging, scale, AND emotional connection. This unique sequel-that-isn't-a-sequel grabs audiences by building on its predecessor-it finally turns John McClane (Bruce Willis) into a truly vulnerable hero fretting with foreknowledge....and for his wife.Somehow, he again stumbles into a public place overrun by terrorists where he's the only one who appreciates the problem. However, his personal situation is different this time: he's not isolated, he just needs the co-operation of someone in authority.DH2's terrorists take a major international airport with impunity because they know they have a pull-push-through advantage in their personnel. But soon they have to contend with not one wildcard (Willis), but two-the second being the airport's quiet genius, Chief Engineer Leslie Barnes (Art Evans). McClane & Barnes keep their emotional distance much more than McClane & Al Powell (Reginald VelJohnson) did, quite sensibly for the franchise. Twinkie-chomping Sgt Powell phones in a short reprise appearance. Literally.McClane's chief homegrown adversary, the traitorous Col. Stuart (William Sandler), is reminiscent of Martin Sheen's sent assassin from Apocalypse Now-a military man suffering from a disappointed cause and intellectual excess. Sandler himself observed that his birthday-suit discipline was `a great opening to a character', and the whole movie. Fans find Col. Stuart an extremely `effective' terrorist (they really hate him)-although his men look obviously out-of-place as they insensitively carry their gaudy (fake) Christmas presents.The setting, during a snowstorm at Christmas, coalesces DH2 into an airport disaster/political technothriller/`superbowl' actioner -hybrid. Its success demonstrates the value of attracting ALL the right professionals.Harlin's canny decision to launch the film immediately after the main title allows the action to appear unrelenting. That impression is further parleyed by huge, logistically nightmarish, yet effortless-looking effects by production designer John Vallone, DoP Oliver Wood, and DH1's Sp/fx Coordinator, Al Disarro. They give us snowmobile chases, moving baggage beltways, and miles&miles of fake snow; make deadly use of scaffolding, fake a couple of jet crashes, and hover a helicopter over the wing of a speeding jumbo! ....The snow itself became an unofficial character once it `insisted' on being trucked in (1989 was infamous for not having any).Such production values were Herculean compared to DH1: John Vallone built a 130'x207' set with an oversized 2-storey ATC-tower (large enough to accommodate the cameras/cranes), coupled with soundstage-spanning miniature runways, miniature planes and miniature lights outside.
The lavish talents of both cast&crew are a real treat-and the reason behind DH2's success, together with the original story.The screenplays of DH1&2 were adaptations of two different novels by completely different authors. Joel Silver's vision turned them into sequential Bruce Willis vehicles. Roderick Thorp(1936-1999) wrote `Nothing Lasts Forever' in 1979, which later became DH1(1988). DH2 was adapted from the Walter Wager novel `58 Minutes'-with added streamlining characters written for DH2 by Thorp-before the screenplay was finalized by Stephen DeSouza & Doug Richardson.DH2 just bulges with action-the `annex skywalk' firefight is best, with all that scaffolding, paint, and glass presenting such dangers to flesh. Thanks to stunt-coordinator Charles Picerni (brother to Paul of the 1960s' The Untouchables), all the homicide victims fall dead in uncomfortable positions, increasing their pathos-and the movie's cred.
Yet despite DH2's achievements, some niggles remain.For one thing, the series has dated a little. Still arrogant, McClane is foul-mouthed and crass to the point of embarrassment-esp. with Carmine Lorenzo (Dennis Franz), the Chief of the terminal police, and with Sam Coleman, the female reporter (Sheila McCarthy).Admittedly, Capt. Lorenzo's lines ARE obnoxious, which force McClane to spout even worse ones in reply: `Hey, Lorenzo! What sets off the metal detectors first? The lead in your a** or the sh!t in your brains?' Sadly, such immaturity undermines them BOTH.Part of the problem was that Franz kept flubbing his lines-he never got comfortable. He has never portrayed an obnoxious character again; he's settled back into disenchanted, apolitical cops.McClane's oft-repeated and sometimes clumsy victimisation unfortunately became DH2's biggest cliche. Since it's the element that reveals the franchise formula, the active excesses had to be dropped: by DH3 McClane is only verbally dismissed.DH2's remaining conceit is its audience-teasing about just who the good/bad guys are. Franz's Lorenzo and John Amos' Major Grant deliver lots of misdirection, but it became impossible to backpedal their stated intentions: Lorenzo's disingenuous smile in the last scene, and Major Grant's 180-degree change of attitude halfway, are difficult to swallow. Jackie Burch didn't miscast; the fault is in the tricky writing.DH2's humour was also tricky: when the rent-a-car attendant (Lauren Letherer) invites McClane for coffee, his comeback-`Just the fax, ma'am'-is cute; but his `...not the kind of ride I'm looking for' to Sam Coleman goes too far: without heightened circumstances, his corrosive hostility is incomprehensible. Such apparent arrogance undermines McClane's character as both a family man AND as a vulnerable hero.We're also repulsed when the older passenger (Jeanne Bates) relates how she'd tested her stun-gun on her own dog! The joke's too ratcheted, yet Holly McClane (Bonnie Bedelia) only reacts with an askance stare. This left the old lady looking too stupid and immoral.Another mistake occurs when the (black) terminal cop (Paul Bollen) points his gun at McClane instead of the fleeing African-American terrorist (Vondie Curtis-Hall)-even if unintentional, this plays like reverse prejudice onscreen (but would've appeared as just typical `McClane-victimisation' had they not cast an African-American as Officer Carlson). Now this WAS careless casting.The film did take artistic license aplenty, but we just love revisiting the same characters, seeing them be put through newer paces.
DH2 really is `the Superbowl of action movies' (Sandler). The less-pleasant true sequel to DH1, DH3, although again directed by McTiernan, is so far removed from the `superbowl'-feel that we're just not interested in any Special Edition.

District 9," Mockumentary surprisingly results in legitimate 'traditional SF first contact' tale.
","Mockumentaries are tricky. They dally with logic stretches beyond the 'norm' in their given topic, so they must appeal to the partial ignorance and vanity about that ignorance in their audience. Our question is whether the whole of D9's output is worthier than its tricks. -Happily, YES; D9 extracts black humour from the racism/Apartheid being satirized, yet tries hard to stretch its 'norms' only a little. In fact D9's mock is a high-wire act, partly for having such a serious subject-matter co-written for laughs by an expatriate South African(Neill Blomkamp's accent is now Canadian), but also for using digital exobiologic realism that surpasses previous alien character-designs, last seen within such a banal human environment 20yrs ago in Alien Nation(1988). Therefore D9's primary originality comes in intercutting its plotted action with mock 'found footage'. Blomkamp's storytelling, because it's well done, amounts to Oscar-worthy editing. Such proficient deployment, for example, of 'tv vision' successfully embeds us in a sense of history passing, giving the film considerable (mock) gravitas. Blomkamp's and producer Peter Jackson(Bad Taste(1988))'s tastes do run to 'blokey' schlock--cf the grisly objects, characters and 'exploding meat-bags' in D9--but this grisliness is integral to its far more sophisticated story punctuating the value of life in a caustic slum. The authentic Chiawelo location was a coup, but my hackles were raised when I found D9 to be missing worldwide perspective. Despite repeatedly referencing 'the whole world watching' Joburg's 'first contact', there is nil political influence on the locals and no worldwide commentary or footage--a glaring plot-point to have overlooked for Blomkamp's budgetary concerns. Although it suffers from plot-rushing and a pile-up of 'Hail-Mary-passes' during the last act, D9 manages to organically combine several Hollywood blockbusters with its own rare originality to result in a (surprisingly) legitimate 'traditional SF first-contact' tale. The film's success rests on (male) audience sophistication. Realising that racism has an economic purpose pivots us toward the aliens to begin 'rooting for' the film's rousing ending. The audience also traverses a huge emotional arc in tandem with the story's lead. Wikus(Sharlto Copley) is our hapless bureaucrat toiling for a multinational, until he's accidentally contaminated by intelligent alien nanofluid, becoming MNU's 'most hunted'. Unfortunately, Blomkamp--a feature-novice director--neglects to verify his 'MNU' (Multi_National_United) as NOT the UN; confused readers should consult the DVD 2nd-disc short 'Conception and Design'(at 8:53m). Blomkamp/Tatchell's collaborated screenplay paints Wikus a lame, 'not very smart'(his mother) 'good son' who's opportunistically racist toward anyone over whom he can exert control; but he still doesn't deserve what happens to him. Because Wikus' character was seeded as wary of the downside of 'cowboy'/mercenary ethics, we trust he'll rise above his pathetic cowardice. He even instructs his hand-picked field replacement--a black man smarter than himself, Fundiswa(Mandla Gaduka)--how to butt heads with the military subcontractors lead by Koobus Venter(David James). During this funny beat on military/civilian enmity, Koobus' team refer to Wikus as 'the FNG'(F'cking New Guy), while Wikus quips about them with an inverted adage:'They shoot first, then they ANSWER questions'! D9's black comedy is sustained by Wikus' racism ('No, don't shoot it NOW, it's illegal to do that'), and by the Mengele-like surgeon so interested in Wikus' 'strong pain reaction' to being skewered with a 'DBX7' during human/alien experiments! Observant viewers will note Blomkamp's unwillingness to 'fix' this scene (for a conclusion that the patient's 'nerves have fused', Wikus needed to skewer himself)--simply because then it wouldn't be funny. Audience relatability to our hero 'prawn' Christopher Johnson (rotomated replacement of actor Jason Cope)--note the moniker-similarity to Blackhawk Down(2001)'s 'skinnies'--was contingent on our empathy for the facial/physical features of Christopher's design; we're left to gather that such human names were assigned to 1.8million aliens by overtired Alien Affairs officers, just as in Alien Nation(1988). The bipedal insect concept allows these aliens to be human-like even in size, but their facial expressions needed to be hauntingly mammalian, not arachnoid. That was delivered by movable facial scaling and the obviously MAMMALIAN over-sized eyes of.....chimpanzees, apparently. And indeed, the most audience-grabbing achievement of D9 for me was its inclusion of 'photo-real' aliens, bettering Avatar(2009) in 2D. (Cameron's WetaDigital artists either didn't start with situated-lighting cinematography, or relied on automated (less-accurate)animation for Avatar(2009)...!)Thanks to Canadian SFX outfit Image Engine('Stargate'(2005-2007)), D9's ~35m of alien visuals really outstrip audience expectations. Their CGI was perfected with 1) WetaWorkshop's clever alien-character design, 2) panoramic/multi-angle light-source cinematography, and 3) Image Engine's hand-rotomated animation based on 2). The cat-food-as-catnip-to-aliens idea was 'homaged' again from Alien Nation(1988), the main 'elephant-in-the-room' inspiration for Alive(2005)/D9. The creators leave it unacknowledged so their originality isn't dismissed by careless comparisons to a beloved earlier franchise (the TV series ended with AN:Dark Horizon(1994)). During the home stretch, the graphic war violence deliberately resembles Blackhawk Down(2001), adding similar 'yayli tanbur'(Turkish bowed lute) wailing music; the exo-suit's awesome anti-gravity weapon successfully distracts viewers from counting the 'Hail-Mary-passes'; and seeing the Nigerians get their comeuppance minus bullets was deliciously reminiscent of Rabbit Fire(1951):us.imdb.com/Find?select=Quotes&for=buwwets! Sadly that entire section of the film feels truncated, due to plot-rushing. There's insufficient vision of the exo-suit, plus it's too easily--not to mention farcically--crippled by human bullets. It stumbles around wounded, anthropomorphically 'bleeding' nanofluid and being altogether too derivative of Robocop(1987)'s Ed-209. So D9 sometimes tries too hard to be 'Hollywood popcorn SF', but it accommodates a rather surprising un-Hollywood ending. One last poignant 'documentary' flourish of Wikus waxing lovingly about his wife proves painful when intercut with the last scene on the heels of the bookending interviews. Such a romantic close was a worthy end to this almost-plausible, rich, fast-paced story. With its blatant pillorying of xenophobia coupled with Enemy Mine(1985)-type buddy action and even spousal romance, D9 is sure to prick naysayer consciences worldwide. It has entered the venerable SF pantheon of 'Stargate', 'Star Trek', 'Alien Nation'...Welcome, D9.(9/10)",9,4,8,7 February 2010
Amadeus," Emotional and musical perfection! COMPULSORY VIEWING - First of my 5 all-time favourites.
","Momma! Emotional and musical perfection. Saul Zaentz's work is impeccable. Mindboggling--he does justice to Mozart! '...Well, ...there it is.' From the two opening strains of Don Giovanni you know you're dead. Milos Forman matches shots-to-music in his prologue, like the master filmmaker he is.The casting of Vincent Schiavelli is also a stroke of genius, as the smarmy peasant/valet to F-Murray Abraham's Antonio Salieri.Schiavelli was perfect in serious roles, he's physically affecting. For Amadeus(1984) he reaches way back into the 18thC to grab it by the cravat, and suddenly, we're back there, with him! ...The sound fades nervously as Salieri is committing something in his room, and then suddenly we're STRUCK DOWN by stentorian violins as we see what Salieri has done to himself. We then quieten along with the music, as various people fuss at a distance getting Salieri onto the sled ambulance and into hospital. Night fades into day, and then.....we're in the nuthouse!The prissy priest(Herman Meckler) taking Salieri's confession is the key to our own denouement. He is us. He's so familiar in 20thC terms that we instinctively connect to his all-at-sea-ineptitude trying to understand the demons of a man much older and more distinguished than himself. Salieri is that older man, bearing his guilt, but despising God whom the inept priest is there to represent. And we're the inept viewers of this uberdrama: common salt-of-the-earth trying to understand the life of a genius. The analogy is thoroughly obvious.Amadeus in real life was paraded around as a prodigy from the age of 4 by his father (1760 was the birth of the 'stage mother'). Based on this, Mozart was a psychologically tortured son, making his dissolution with wine, women, and vaudeville so understandable. Amongst his peers, only Salieri did not dismiss him. 'This was no composition by a performing monkey. THIS was a music I'd never heard--filled with such longing, such unfulfillable longing, it seemed to me that I was hearing the voice of God'.And that's our key: Amadeus(1984) is really a movie about Man vs God.Indeed there really was a Salieri, but there is no evidence whatsoever that this drama occurred between them. It was Peter Shaffer's play that conjectured Salieri's envy of Mozart's talent 'as a lust in my body'.Clearly, no composer of the 18thC would ever be able to comprehend Mozart's talents without equating it with the hand of God: 'I was staring through the cage of those meticulous brushstrokes at an absolute beauty'. Mozart was a savant (latest research suggests that all of us can become savants in one field but only at the cost of brain damage elsewhere). 'Displace one note, and there would be diminishment. Displace one phrase, and the structure would fall', admits Salieri, who secretly disagrees with the other Italians in Emperor Joseph II's court that Mozart's compositions have 'too many notes'. He understood well that an edifice of beauty is still a house of cards. Supremely jealous, however, he made a hate-filled pact with God: 'because you choose for your instrument a boastful, lustful, smutty, infantile boy, and give me for reward only the ability to recognize the incarnation--because you are unjust, unfair, unkind--I will block you'.It is in these scenery-chewing emotional confessions that Abraham, the actor, is best.Even so, I am prepared to go out on a limb: he didn't deserve the Oscar if that meant that Thomas Hulce couldn't get one. I've known F-Murray first from the lowbrow comedy The Ritz(1976), and without a doubt, he was more at home--better--in that (as a flagrant yet lovable homosexual who befriends a straight innocent). In Amadeus(1984), Abraham's obsequiousness frequently looks awkward, and I can't just put it down to character. I've also witnessed a similar discomfort when he was a detective in Serpico(1973).Both Tom Hulce and Jeffrey Jones (for Jones' unforgettable portrayal of Emperor Joseph II) should have received Oscars too.....but frankly, in a cast of this high caliber, it's a travesty to actually single anyone out! Returning to plot, it's always saddened me that Mozart and Salieri ALMOST connected during the last hours of Mozart's life. Unfortunately each maestro was a terrible judge of people. Salieri was forever dashing himself against Mozart's superior talent, while Amadeus arrogantly overused his single trump card until it stopped having impact.What a waste of humanity that even such talented men should become so alienated by their male egos.Amadeus's ignominious burial becomes finally comprehensible: he'd been an impetuous fellow who never appreciated that he needed the help of his peers if he was ever to live amongst them. The perennial problem of genius is how to survive being (mis)understood by those who vastly outnumber him.Finally, in retelling his story to the priest, Salieri realizes that it was God himself, not he, Salieri, who killed Mozart. He finally laughs derisively at his religion, accusing the priest's 'own 'merciful' God who destroyed His own beloved, rather than let a mediocrity share in the smallest part of His glory'. Indeed, the priest has by the end of Salieri's confession lost all certainty in his own church line. And rightly so, because God-given talent can just as easily be the vehicle for Man's destruction. God always wins. Perhaps Einstein was overly generous to claim that 'God does not play dice with the universe'. Whether mediocre or a perfect talent, people are born to die unjustly, as indeed the entire ecosystem must (all living things rely on the death of others). So is not any level of analysis less than God's a worthless ruse? Salieri had the priest, and by eyeing the audience, us too, pegged right, as mediocrities. In the end, he declared himself their Patron Saint and took refuge in a sanitarium--another ignominy. Today we might diagnose him as suffering from (self-induced?) post-traumatic stress-disorder.Watch this and BAWL--I did.10/10",10,2,4,30 August 2002
Event Horizon," Should be renamed Ripped Off and Sucked In (1997). Awful. 0.0001/10.
","WARNING: SPOILERS!Event Horizon (1997) starts out great: the special effects begin as part of the opening credits: there is a fabulous segue from the Paramount studio logo up into space, refocusing on the stars and onto an apparent gaseous event horizon around a black hole. An event horizon is the perceivable limit, or the boundary between describable and indescribable physics at the edge of a 'singularity'. A singularity, a 'black hole' star fallen into its own gravity well, can be visualized, just as the Simpsons did, as an infinite, bottomless pit, if you consider normal spacetime essentially a two-dimensional plane. It really is supposed to be infinite, with nothingness and no dimensions, no spacetime, at the bottom. Hell, nothing anywhere inside a black hole can make any sense at all. You and I keep our brains in normal spacetime, and we just don't have any frame of reference at all in common with a singularity. None. That's the point.At the perceivable edge of this thing, back onto normal space, there are some slightly less weird physics, which we have called the 'event horizon'. This is the one-way membrane hiding the black hole. But forget black holes; the event horizon ITSELF is really bad news. If you are unlucky enough to supposedly get stuck in one, you get stretched out infinitely (ouch), because in just the distance between your head and your foot the difference in the gravitational force acting upon you approaches the infinite. For 'you', time does not pass, and you cannot even be said to have died. Anyway, that's the theory.Black holes were a hotly debated theoretical entity among astrophysicists for about 25 years, especially after Carl Sagan's friend, Kip Thorne of Cal Tech came up with 'wormholes' around 1970, the theoretical possibility of a path in spacetime through the singularity instead of hitting it (there is a mathematical solution to an equation, but Stephen Hawking doesn't like it much because it depends on too many other variables). The wormhole joins two points of spacetime together temporarily, but you need two gravity wells to make that happen. That's what the 'gravity drive' on The Event Horizon is supposed to be doing.So in 1997 Paul Anderson (annoyingly similarly named to sci-fi novelist Poul Anderson) and Paramount tried to fictionalize what it might be like to survive a wormhole. What a good idea (NOT) it was to imagine that the gravity drive would also drive astronauts mad. How stupid do you have to be to accept such rubbish? -Well, very.Don't misunderstand, I have no real problem with the folding of spacetime: so it would take a black hole in front and a black hole behind your spaceship (according to the actual scientific theory); so what? Surely the crew of the Event Horizon could have already tamed and placed two such warm and fuzzy singularities on a leash. No problem.Instead, my problem with the plot of Event Horizon (1997) is that the much vaunted gravity drive would interfere with the neurochemistry  and that's all  of human brains in normal spacetime. Kind of a big flaw, don't you think? It would be rather difficult to develop the technology without somebody overseeing the PLANETARY BUDGET needed, actually noticing. Kip Thorne doesn't even appear to have been consulted for this, and perhaps there's a reason for that. The hallucination premise is the avenue for supplying lots of explosions, blood, guts and gore  excitement, but only for bozos. Miramax/ Palace put out a similar schlocky but cheaper turkey 7 years before, called Hardware (1990), which is the only movie I actually walked out on in my whole life. I was THIS CLOSE to walking out on Event Horizon (1997).The casting is OK. Laurence (previously usually credited as Larry, and before that, again as Laurence, I kid you not) Fishburne is the acceptable lead, as Captain Miller. Larry went on to be Morpheus in The Matrix (1999). Onya Larry, he's the only winner out of Event Horizon. I just wish he would figure out who he is.I really appreciate Sam Neill for taking so many 'big science' roles, probably beginning with Jurassic Park (1993). Here he is Dr Weir, the inventor of the 'gravity drive', but it's thoroughly awful and depressing to see him so denigrated later on in this movie to a hideous schlock character aboard the bad ship Event Horizon. Please do watch him in The Dish (2000) instead, where he is the sweetest, most mild-mannered radio astronomer you could ever hope to see.Kathleen Quinlan is lovely as usual, but she is wasted as the doctor aboard this popsicle, and remains forgettable. Jack Noseworthy gets initially red-shirted (in Star Trek parlance) within the first half-hour. Unfortunately his thesping is not missed. He had been mugging for the camera again and throwing away whatever lines he had. Richard T Jones as Cooper is somewhat brighter, but he too is annoying with his lack of discipline. Just because his starship captain is also an African American is no reason for Cooper to revert to a stereotype. He's either a mission specialist who NEVER WAS a stereotype- HELLO- or he's a bozo who shouldn't be there.I recommend no-one stays around for the tease ending, which is so lame that it is necessary to tell the audience that 'The End' has arrived. Ripped off and sucked in, man! Paramount's executives at the time approved this bizarre cross between cutting edge scientific theory and stupid schlock. To whom are they trying to appeal? Any audience capable of understanding the science will not be impressed by mindless blood and gore. Probably the single most offensive disappointment of the 20th century. MAJOR turkey. Stay away in droves (if you can)! Sorry, Larry, no reflection on your work. 0.0001/10.",1,22,48,8 August 2002
The Dark Knight," Jingle bells, Batman smells, Robin ran away........
","Sigh. They almost got it right, and with the right franchise too (Batman as the HUNTED hero had the most potential as allegory for the male human condition). Unfortunately at some point the fact that this is a reboot (of a reboot)^3--in just the movie series alone--is a problem. It implies a serious weakness in the CONCEPT ITSELF.As I was writing this review I asked myself just when did I drop out of this movie? -11 minutes in. By then there were already enough annoyances to have induced my disengagement. Here are some of them: 1) The reboots(!); 2) the bank job prologue (opening scene) which adapts the basic story of 44Minutes:The_North_Hollywood_Shoot-Out(2003 made-for-TV docudrama); 3) wasting William Fichtner in a nothing mobster role all over in a second; 4) too many red herrings with the ridiculous faux 'Batdudes'; 5) Batman's audio-'soured' voice; 6) Lt.Gordon(Oldman)'s similarly but accidentally audio-'soured' voice in the vault scene as he says 'we'd have to hit all the banks simultaneously, SWAT teams...' (we DID notice,sorry) --and all this within the first 11mins!!Then there was the manipulative attempt at confusing the ignorant in the audience with the ruse about Commissioner Gordon. Anyone who knows this term will not accept LIEUTENANT Gordon's untimely death, but it's enough to turn us against the screenwriter. This is called 'ratcheting' the plot, aka 'yanking the audience's chain'. And there's a lot more where that came from in this movie--that's its main problem.One admittedly unavoidable problem was caused be the basic pull--antagonism--in a graphic novel adaptation into live action: superhero comics naturally venture into the fantastic, and it's hard to show the impossible for real. If you're trying to insert fantasy into a police procedural, you cannot get gross or outlandish in the way you represent this.For instance, during the transportation scene with Harvey Dent(Eckhart), although it already rankles that the truck-driver's offsider does nothing to prevent the hijacking during the VERY OBVIOUS criminal misdirection with the burning firetruck, the over-the-top nature of the graffiti'd word 'SLAUGHTER' on the side of the attacking rig just makes you lose patience with their abandonment of their previous police procedural tone.Ebert likes this installment best. I know why; it's because this sequel tries so hard to be both realistic and allegorical towards society's ills, but it's at junctures like the above hijack scene that if they get it just a little bit on the 'wrong' side for people like me, they take us out of their picture.And I have bad news for the filmmakers: sooner or later we will all be thinking like this. It's a function of their having raised the bar, but just not far enough, so it undermines its own standard.For people like them, CGI is a trap like catnip. It's all in the tone that you strike; and if you decided that it's OK to depict Two-Face's face all in CGI, revealing teeth underneath the skinless CG-muscle and tendons on that side, then you deserve the flak you're going to cop for it. Here it is: what a SHODDY, mistaken choice that was! It makes your almost-great movie into an embarrassing piece of 'shlock'--YES, there is a word for it.Shlock. Or shtick. Where is Mel Brooks when you really need him?More examples of wrong tonal balance:7) the dinner debate scene about Batman's future role in a democracy is theoretically very admirable, but misfires because it's misplaced at the table amidst all the verbal fencing between two couples(!)--its gravitas is lost in the shuffle;8) Bruce Wayne's awful speech pillorying Harvey Dent undermines our faith in him too, which he tries to undo for Rachel Dawes (Gyllenhaal's annoying replacement for Katie Holmes again smacks of 'rebootism'). His venom was unnecessary, what was his point?;9) (just a little bit) more screen-time should have been paid to the emergent concern of Harvey/Gordon's prisoners in the traffic snarl, so we could emotionally join in on the ferry for the scene's significance for humane compassion. The battle of wills with The Joker about this was significant, but the audience doesn't get to chew over the so-called Prisoner's Dilemma (from game theory);10) Two-Face was too rabid in his scenes. He/Harvey used to be well-adjusted, so the (ratcheted) petrol burn and the accidental loss of his fiancée simply didn't justify why he became so violent. Without showing his back-story, it's irresponsible to either kill him or turn him so deeply and irrevocably psychotic, all in one picture. Where's the deep significance of 'what he lost'?; 11) Dent's hospital-room yelling is implausible: he shouldn't have enough strength to roar at Gordon, let alone have the option of rejecting skin grafts. No ER patient would be given that option. Since this is completely implausible, why ruin our disbelief?;12-A) Dent's skeletal musculature CG vision is also wrong within the Batman mythos. But burn victims never have clean muscle afterwards anyway, so why depict a falsity when you could have just applied practical prosthetics? -for obvious directorial (self-)indulgence given access to cheap CGI;12-B) there was no plotwise reason for the deep burn either, since Batman was rescuing Dent from the flames. Why was Two-Face burned? -Again, purely directorial self-indulgence with CG (I would've loved to hear the screaming-match in the Exec Prod's office about this);13) the darkened interrogation cell for The Joker was also audience-manipulative directorial self-indulgence. The room, if you recall, was darkened excessively during Gordon's interrogation, just so the Batman reveal could shock the audience. Completely implausible; wouldn't have worked in real life because reality can't control 'the fourth wall' (the audience's POV). Overripe and ridiculous.B-TDK(2008) does contain several great points, but I'm not wasting word-count on them. Suffice to say that 'Jingle bells, Batman smells, Robin (CLEARLY) ran away'...",6,25,52,3 January 2009
Elysium," A film desperately missing its female collaborator
","It's not even its thematic unoriginality regards Earth's slum-ridden overpopulation and the related notion of gated communities (cf Wall-E(2008), Back to the Future 2(1989)) that is such a disappointment: the biggest problem with Elysium is that it's soulless... Matt Damon and his love interest notwithstanding. The South African slum redesign of LA is only a little irritating, but the film's ham-fisted and artificial plot device of a desperately sick child is so hackneyed that it doesn't muster any emotion in the audience at all.Later, the scientific inaccuracies and the glossover depiction of the orbiting habitat will silently irk an informed audience. For instance, there seems no evident cause for, or mechanism by which an atmosphere is maintained on this 'Stanford torus'-space station, which is itself apparently so small that you can see its curvature from a couple of feet off the ground - its scale when viewed from Earth would instead dictate that it be far larger, be visibly spinning, which it apparently isn't, and have a visible dark-to-light stratospheric barrier, which is nowhere in evidence. The people who live there can't just breathe direct space in the sunshine! Stratospheres have consequences dictated by physics and engineering: they necessitate an- and aerobic engines, and impose different crash results for the 'landing' shuttlecraft. And there is a second, equally preposterous 'Biddleonian'-Firing-Squad-scene (shooting turrets arranged in a circle), in which the spacecraft's exploding shards neither burn up nor behave ballistically, because they're hitting the non-existent atmosphere.So Blomkamp's space station fails to measure up to Stanley Kubrick's far more plausible 1968 effort in the classic 2001:A Space Odyssey. Never remind an audience of a classic and then suck by comparison. Elysium's irkingly ignorant '...Ehm... and then future science happens' attitude just can't draw audiences in anymore.The other annoying plot device is the imposition of radiation poisoning on Matt Damon's Max. This choice is so badly jarring (too serious a sickness for so many physical challenges to overcome) that it's just impossible to accept the really dying character fighting baddies at all, let alone getting alternately better then worse, then better, better, better, then worse, and better again, whenever the plot required.Clearly this wasn't just a problem of shooting scenes out of sequence. Max's implausible bouts of robust/ill-health and back again is just careening overcontrol by the plot, which needed him to frequently forget that he was mortally ill - all while undergoing the physical assault of that horrid, unhygienic, and implausible exoskeleton.Worse, the two neglectful human perpetrators of Max's irradiation, the mercs-for-hire, as well as the pointlessly ruthless robotic 'policemen', were all so poorly drawn (caricatured) that they degraded the film's tone during their scenes to that of a graphic novel . Yes, the very same graphic novel that Blomkamp used to pitch his story to the movie stars who signed on board. Unfortunately there is little human feeling in the story to uplift it all afterward. Neill Blomkamp's first feature film, District 9(2009), had been full of organic and unforced pathos four years ago, emotionally recalling and paying silent homage to the far more earnest Enemy Mine(1986)). District eked out surprising amounts of empathy from its audience and totally captured our hearts. Blomkamp's second film simply does nothing of the sort.So Elysium is commonly experienced as soulless.Interestingly, perennial recent bad guy William Fichtner now seems to specialize in roles that are soon-to-be-'red- shirted' (Star Trek parlance), as he again undertakes here.The third act's last-ditch effort to make Sharlto Copley's ruthless mercenary Kruger suddenly develop a psychic break (the plot just lost its mind here, too) just to turn him into a crazed Terminator type in fact totally loses the film any of its elevated themes. Themes such as its internalised debate about aggressive border protectionism. If anything, that should have been the thrust of this sci-fi plot, but it's lost in this morass of careening, hackneyed, and embarrassingly ignorant cartoonish set of action pieces.There was utterly no reason or rhyme for Copley's Kruger to go 'Terminator', so again, Elysium is reminding its audience of a classic, then sucking by comparison. If you introduce a sudden gross plot change without on screen explanation with character linkages, it will be necessarily perceived as careening. Rarely are a big budget feature's ostensibly shrouded graphic novel origins so embarrassingly on show.In the end it's just glaringly obvious that Blomkamp's past collaborator, screenwriter Terri Tatchell, had too little input into his follow-up film (she only gets a Thank You credit), because this grinding screenplay eventually wears back down into a graphic novel without her: code for 'boys only'. Dear Terri, please come back....(5/10)",5,6,12,19 August 2013
This Is Spinal Tap," STILL the best mockumentary of all time; Best in Show(2000) by most of the same actors is merely a distant second. 10/10. Baby spoilers.
","`We don't....we're....we're not university material.'Just get the Special Edn right now-if you don't, you'll be missing half the movie. Literally. The half that was deleted for theatrical release is every bit as good, and fresh, as the half that was kept.The actors' talents will blow you away. Not only do Michael McKean as David St.Hubbins and  Christopher Guest as Nigel Tufnel have impeccable East-Ender English accents (tragically, Harry Shearer's accent as Derek Smalls keeps slipping back into his real Yank), but the actors pick up their old-pair-of-jeans personas 16yrs later for the audio commentary.
It's as if Spinal Tap never `retired'.`In the 1990s the fictitious group reunited for a series of concerts and a TV special' (Leonard Maltin). Naturally, for years I thought Tap were a real band: with an authentic logo, a 1980s white-trash-rocker-look with long, heavy-metal hair, skeleton-emblazoned sleeveless T-shirts and lurid lycra hotpants, they're indistinguishable from real rockers of the day.
They even nail a 1960s soundalike clip, 'Listen to the Flower People'. Shame we never see its follow-up song, 'Again with the Flower People'-its title alone implies hilarity. During DiBergi's `rockumentary', Tufnel also plays a gorgeous, tinkly `Mach' piano solo, which he has unfortunately called 'Lick my Love-Pump'.All their video clips are credible, except for 'Stonehenge' (St.Hubbins' defense is to blame their manager:  `...but you're not as confused as Nigel-are you?').It was a lot of fun getting fooled, but discovering it was all bogus makes them seem all the more talented, and hilarious!Their very first drummer, John 'Stumpy' Peeps (Ed Begley Jr) supposedly died `in a freak gardening accident'. His replacement died by choking on vomit. `Actually, he choked on someone else's vomit', adds Tufnel in a DiBergi interview. During their Flower People period Peter 'James' Bond apparently `exploded on stage' in a green puff of smoke. His replacement also `exploded'. 'Tap now think they despatched something like 37 drummers over the years.The boys are indeed screamingly funny (listen closely to the dialogue). Infuriatingly, Leonard Maltin thinks they aren't funny enough, despite calling their effort `cunning satire'. Their humour is extreme improv, which cannot afford too many over-the-top lines, lest it jeopardizes our suspension of disbelief!Spinal Tap are dopey repulsivos narcissistically convinced of their own relevance. The actors play them completely straight, which requires timing that never slips up. Mockumentaries take enormous discipline and talent. Clearly McKean, Guest & Shearer could do St.Hubbins, Tufnel & Smalls till the cows came home. (There's about an hour's worth of additional 1984 footage on the Special Edition DVD; plus the brand new audio commentary recorded 16yrs later).The director of the `rockumentary', Marty DiBergi (actually the co-writer of the script, the songs, actor, and also the real director, Rob Reiner), remains admirably skeptical in reporting Tap's comprehensive lack of success during their comeback tour of America, ie now that their appeal has become `more selective'.He probes their pasts, asks the relevant questions, and reads out `published reviews' of their previous albums:*'Intravenus DeMilo': `The tasteless cover is a good indication of the lack of musical invention within. The musical growthrate of this band cannot even be charted; they're treading water in a sea of retarded sexuality and bad poetry', to which the boys retort, `That's nitpicking!'*'Shark Sandwich': `This had a 2-word review. Sh!t sandwich.'DiBergi then goes on to observe that `the makeup of your audience seems to be young...boys'. St.Hubbins+Tufnel explain: `Well, it's a sexual thing, really. Aside from the identifying the boys do with us, there's also a reaction of the female(s) to our music....' Tufnel: `Really, they're quite fearful.  They see us on stage, with tight trousers; we've got, you know, armadillos in our trousers!....it's quite frightening, the size; and they run, screaming' (watch McKean almost lose it for real at Guest's `armadillo' improv).Tap's litany of embarrassing stage accidents (over&above the despatched drummers) include Nigel overextending backwards and getting stuck; their stage-effect `pods' seizing up with Derek inside while stagehands feverishly hammer away; and sound interference from an airbase transmission tower. But the never-to-be-forgotten CLASSIC is when the band gets lost underground, trying to find the stage door. Of course, this scene has since been paid homage by legitimate bands such as The Rolling Stones, admitting the same thing happening to them in real life!The list of cameos includes Fran Drescher as Bobbie Flekman the Polymer Records hostess; Dana Carvey and Billy Crystal as mime waiters in whiteface (backstage, Crystal, the head waiter, in an apparently throwaway role, bosses the unrecognizable Carvey around with `Mime is money!  Move it!'); Patrick MacNee as Sir Dennis; Crystal's real-life friend Bruno Kirby as that limo driver enamoured of Frank Sinatra; Joyce Hyser from Just One of the Guys as Brenda the brunette groupie; Anjelica Huston as the Stonehenge modelmaker; and as mentioned, Ed Begley Jr as 'Stumpy' Peeps.No `rockumentary' would be complete without the obligatory group breakup, hysterical tantrums and overbearing girlfriends; but Tap's level of talent and commitment seems to prick the bubbles of all heavy-metal bands.The credits roll-at 1hr:16mins-much too soon, because the movie is still going. DiBergi is still interviewing them, asking, `Do you feel your music is racist?' St.Hubbins and Tufnel rebuff this with `No, 'course not, we say `Love your brother'-well, we don't say it, really'; `...We don't literally say it...we don't literally mean it...'-a line that always slays me. THIS line is MY fav., not Maltin's one about the amplifier dial that `goes up to 11'-which for me is only the 2nd-funniest.TiST still reigns as the Mother of All Mocku(rocku)mentaries, with its seamless, screamingly funny `cunning satire'.(10/10)",10,10,17,14 March 2003
To Kill a Mockingbird," Every bit as good as they say (B&W). Still POWERFUL. 10/10. Spoilers.
","Horton Foote's Oscar-winning screenplay is so good, it really supplants the 1960 Harper Lee book. I've recently re-read the novel, and it seemed weighed down and paced with backwoods vernacular and situations right out of the 1930s, that are shockingly removed from the 21st century. My goodness. I hope it doesn't strike others so, because the book is a gem too. It's just in need of ...updating perhaps, which is what the 1962 movie excels at; it translates the Depression Era for us. The characters (played, eg by Gregory Peck and Brock Peters in their signature roles) seem so much better-depicted on screen than merely in my own imagination from having read the book!
Only Arthur/'Boo' Radley (a peroxided Robert Duvall) seems at first a jarring casting choice to me; but in the end all seem terrific.Now THESE child actors, Mary Badham ('Scout'), Philip Alford ('Jem'), and John Megna (as 'Dill'), should've won Oscars. I'm sure they're all better than Haley Joel Osment, who strikes me as 'studied'. These kids are just natural, completely oblivious of the camera. Unbelievable. Actually, I wonder what genius DID do the casting, because the film gives no casting credit. I guess in 1962 the CSA didn't exist yet... That casting director deserves an Oscar too.This is what great filmmaking is all about; when several areas of perfection are jointly present a film that reaches into your heart and yanks you up and down. Those were real acting jobs, not the cretinous drivel passing for 'work' these days. The reason we don't see too many better movies than Das Experiment is because post-modernism has long encamped in Hollywood (it set up a Starbuck's years ago).The first scene instantly captures Scout's world. She's learning fast at the shoulder of her loving widower lawyer father that she shouldn't embarrass people who are even poorer than they are; and Jem is tantrumming up a tree because he can't brag about his dad's non-existent cool to his friends. Jem demands Atticus play football(!) for the Mets, or more uproariously as Scout tells it, for `the Methodists', hahahaha. (Can we picture Methodists in a sackrace? How many Methodists does it take to change a lightbulb?)The Boo Radley story arc is much better paced in the movie than the book; but because I want to focus on the race-relations arc, I will only make passing comment on Boo: he is gently painted in both the book and movie as another previously dismissed but highly virtuous person, who deserves to be analogized with the fragile, hopeful beauty of the mockingbird.
The harrowing exploration of entrenched injustice through various acts of racist violence are adult themes that really couldn't be explored well in a book constrained by the first person narrative of a 7-yr-old little girl. The movie is able to show the Tom Robinson court case much more objectively. Robert Mulligan's direction quickly telegraphs Bob Ewell's shifty creepiness with the scene of his slovenly leering at Atticus' children in the car. Collin Wilcox is also heartrending as Mayella, the ignorant, uneducated and abused daughter of Bob Ewell. Inexplicably, Gregory Peck's cross-examination scene is not quite as sensitive as Atticus is in the book; Peck never reveals that flash of pain at having to destroy Mayella's false testimony.
Little Scout's key scene, where she embarrasses the lynch mob (collectively no better than Tom Ewell alone) just with her amiable child's chatter, is EVERY BIT as powerful and stressful as in the book. Probably more, because body language is a much better form of expression for a scene like this.Brock Peters' Tom Robinson is the archetypal decent black man who, YES, felt sorry for a brutalized white woman, as we all ought to. Don't bother debating `what if he was guilty', because TKAM is not a whodunnit; it's an expose of what used to happen WHEN a black man was innocent. The heartbreaking destruction of Tom Robinson's proverbial mockingbird is our collective shame, even now, because similar dismissive laziness still happens. It's every person's character that matters, not whether they're `Methodists'.We do construct our identities as part of various groups. But no group membership, or belief about it, makes any person categorically virtuous. That still hinges on a person's strengths, and crucially, their weaknesses. A person's bad character will overwhelm whatever beliefs they hold; their good character will enhance them. We are all free to act better, or worse, than our beliefs; we're NOT powerless over them, so no-one should ever die over a belief. Cooler thinking than mere violence must rule, or else objective justice will never materialize. And it's only justice if the judgement is accurate; but accuracy requires the abolition of the sort of intellectual/societal laziness that regularly befalls the weakest subgroups of society. Well, we all saw the intellectual rigour of that lynch mob. Would you trust them to tell the time? You might not feel happy trusting even the sheriff (Frank Overton), testifying in court but no better than a hick himself: `Oh, I guess that would make it her LEFT'. Those powerful imbeciles stood in judgement over some societally fragile people, like Tom, and yes, like Mayella.It's still powerful how Tom's hammering as sarcastic legal argument by the prosecutor (William Windom) served to bring home Tom's societal fragility; and we're humbled at the quiet dignity of the entire black population who soberingly stood in the rafters to honor Atticus' failed attempt. The movie was made in 1961, some 7 years before the martyrdom of Martin Luther King Jr, yet in the light of recent gang-related violence, it's clear there are still many who think their group belonging excuses/masks their brutality as people. It does not. And the brutality came first.This movie needs to be seen by the young, to open their hearts to humanity, and their standards for their own personal character, for the rest of their lives. 10/10.",10,34,41,20 October 2002
American Gangster," Coasts in neutral for too long. What went wrong, Sir Ridley?
","The first thing everyone mentions--or likes--about American Gangster is that it's based on a remarkable true story. Well, three such classics were released 30yrs ago, around the time AG is set: The French Connection(1971), Serpico(1973), and The SuperCops(1974). There weren't more basically because the Knapp Commission nabbed the corrupt cops, making the story moot, until Blow(2001).While AG(2007) references Dets.Eddie Egan and Sonny Grasso of the actual Marseilles ('French Connection') drug bust, SuperCops(1974) spoofed two real undercover cops of the time. Nicknamed 'Batman and Robin' by most of Bedford-Stuyvesant, Dave Greenberg and Bob Hantz worked their beat miles from Frank Lucas' Harlem.So a lot of early 1970s cops got famous for doing their jobs, since the heroin-based 'black(secret) economy' grew to employ so many people over the previous 20yrs that it corrupted police forces across the country.Sadly as a biopic, AG coasts in neutral until Sam and Dave's Hold_On_I'm_Comin' at 38mins.The Australian version comes out the gate like the Sopranos, unfortunately following its violent opening with a disjoint 1968 scene of Lucas(Washington) intently watching Bumpy(Clarence Williams.III)'s 'bread-and-circuses' act from the back. It's also unclear that Frank is already dealing for himself when he's harassed by 'Mr 20%'(Idris Elba). These are editing issues.Not only are signpost dates of the story often missing (or are so subtle that you only catch them by accident), but the structural choice to stay ahead of the audience for 4/5ths of this LONG movie robs our eventual discovery (about how the drugs were being smuggled) of emotional impact. Better-structured movies like Michael Clayton(2007) 'promise' an explanation, and deliver at least two-thirds in.AG also lacks humour, with only two such scenes: the one where Richie(Crowe) is offered a bribe of a new technology called a microwave and he replies 'No thank you', and where he hauls a man following him off the street to discover the guy is just a process-server loosening his bowels into his pants.The need to appeal to younger audiences forced some awkward overcompensations with the language, substituting Ebonics (1990s) for Jive (1970s). This is a subconscious irritant for anyone who's watched the original 'Mod Squad'(1968-1973), which, incidentally, gave Clarence Williams.III his career.Worst of all, AG suffers horribly from megastar miscastings. Joe Morton (too sweet for a gangster), Cuba Gooding.Jr (overacting in a nothing role), and Russell Crowe (too much the Bronzed Aussie with a 1980s haircut!!) all should've been recast with unknowns. Denzel even looks wrong: the real Frank Lucas looked more like the pudgy Frank Hayes character from SuperCops(1974).It's great that (as Lucas) Washington quotes Chris Rock's standup about African-Americans not knowing how to become 'wealthy', but his acting choices for Frank don't always suit him. Denzel crucially lacks credibility speaking even Ebonics--witness his 'bid'ness' and 'bup-bup-bup-bup-baaaaa' while arguing with Nate(Roger Guenveur Smith).Smith's 'a'ight' is groaningly bad, too--it doesn't fit his uniform; while Ted Levine('Buffalo Bill' from Silence of the Lambs(1991)) and Armand Assante are just two mushmouths too many on AG. Crowe never gets the Australian out of his 'Jewish' NY accent; and (as Joey Sadano) Ritchie Coaster can't get the Italian in. What is this? Duelling (Bad)Accents?! Whether these stars were miscast, rushed for time, or just poorly edited, SOMEBODY sold us 'an Edsil'.'Sir'Ridley Scott is responsible for this disappointment, with help from his brother Tony and Brian Grazer. What went wrong? Presumably there just wasn't enough screen time for exposition or 'light-and-shade' in this long movie pared-to-the-bone-from-being-really-overlong, so that even Oscar-winning editor Pietro Scalia looks like he screwed up. Scalia's second 'guerilla montage' of drug-addicted devastation is so easy to miss (lasting only 27s) that it's virtually subliminal--so why make a biopic on the topic? One can just sense a much longer Director's Cut in the offing. Hopefully. Studio execs should just LET Ridley WORK.Eventually the audience compensates for the uneven editing and figures out what the plot's doing and who everybody is, but it's no longer enjoyable.Beyond that, there's the social discomfort of the family's corruption. Frank was 'buying off cops since (he) was 10yrs old' and his mother was ignoring it for 30yrs. Much of our discomfort is editorialised through the irony of recalling more innocent imagery of North-migrating African-American families in slow-creeping Lincolns.I had surprisingly strong revulsions against 1) Mama Lucas(Ruby Dee)'s unquestioning ACCEPTANCE of her career-criminal son's massive mansion; and 2) against Frank's 'Miss Puerto Rico' wife, who thought that dumping a kind boxing champion for a murdering drug baron was the apex of social-climbing. But 'you don't know what you'd do till you're put under pressure; a'course 110th Street is a hellova tester'(Bobby Womack, 1972).To his credit, Ridley doesn't shy away from indirectly critiquing 1970s Harlem, either. He encourages our dismay at Bumpy Johnson's 'Robbin' Hood' act back in 1968 by showing how Bumpy, and later Frank, controlled Harlem with 'bread and circuses' like Emperor Commodus.Not for nothing', but 1968 was the last year of Martin Luther King's life; his words fell on deaf ears in Harlem, where people were more interested in Frank's frozen turkeys....we now know better, realising that this supplanting drug-economy made Harlem virtually a 'failed state', not much better than Afghanistan today.For anyone still unsure, there is a more sinister explanation for AG's disappointment, involving its 68 'stunt people', of whom only 28 at most appear on screen (during the Huey Lucas chase). Most of those do little work for the money. The stunts budget, then, probably pushed the whole so far into the red that there wasn't any left for cleanup of the booms in shot, at least 4x in the Sydney print! There are, of course, many things that work, but the studio's insistence on cutting AG for time made it into a 'frozen turkey', when by rights Ridley Scott should have delivered us a Thanksgiving dinner.Maybe the (40-or-so) missing stunt people ATE it.(7/10)",7,0,1,21 March 2008
Step Up," 'It's just that y'all are talking' about dancing like it's rocket science!' WARNING: Spoilers and filmmakers' Notes.9/10
","Without TV's 'So You Think You Can Dance', Eminem as a character model, and especially without writer Duane Adler's Baltimore past, this dance movie would never have become the minor classic alongside Adler's Save the Last Dance(2000) it's now seen as. A third movie is now in the works.Many 'fluffier' dance movies (Honey(2004), Stomp the Yard(2007), and the insufferable Centre Stage(2000)) have inadequate plots/resolutions. Socially relevant dance movies have tended to elude filmmakers--sadly because it often eludes the dance industry itself. Step Up(2006) actually refers to this with Tyler's line 'I'm sorry, it's just that y'all're talking' 'bout dancing like it's rocket science'! Screenwriters Melissa Rosenberg and Duane Adler, based on his original story, subsequently fought hard for a 'great dance movie', flip-flopping with lead character back-stories for authenticity. They achieved it, only to have the rushed-to-cinemas 2008 sequel ruin it again: for some ungodly reason, the adorable and talented Ann Flether--choreographer/director of the original--was 'not available' to direct the sequel, only Executive Producing the 2008 stinker which, shockingly, made more money.Step Up(2006)'s opening credits immediately herald a movie which takes great care to 'execute with precision', as credits are individually wiped by the digital recombination of dancers over text, challenging even 007 credit sequences for ingenuity.Adler's timeless coming-of-age story concerns the clash of two dance worlds, which promises and delivers a Romeo-and-Juliet style romance. Setting the story in the writer's hometown of Baltimore gives the racial issues authenticity.These are instantly turned on their head, reminding us of singer Eminem's bio, as a poor white 'brutha' remains family to his black friends while the rich 'white' girl is actually brown and from a broken home. Nora(Jenna Dewan) isn't 'stuck up'--she's just every bit as neurotic and ambitious as most art school seniors who have all been abusively driven to self-obsession by an unforgiving performance industry. In other words, the leads are both well-drawn characters from real life who are only as flawed or complex as the story requires. Additionally, Tyler's foster mother Lena(Jane Beard) and his precocious foster sister Camille(Alyson Stoner) are at least honestly drawn characters with their own problems.The film's most serious hiccup comes during the first act, with a terribly ham-fisted attempt to pull us into the art school world: the older of the three delinquents are both way too old to be throwing stones or trashing a school. This counterintuitive plot device is further stretched to incredulity by Tyler's martyrdom with the 'rent-a-cop'. What would've played instead is Tyler's self-sacrifice had it been Skinny(De'Shawn Washington) who was nabbed because he'd been the 'recessive gene'-teen who did most of the trashing. That would've worked better--Skinny always was a crime scene waiting to happen.The other supporting characters are, if anything, even better. Miles(Mario) and Lucy(Drew Sidora) have an even less stereotypical bickering secondary romance written for them than the leads got. For one thing, it's Miles who's kinder and smarter than the girl--how refreshing! In their role-reversing relationship, he finally tells Lucy off: 'If you want to be with somebody who doesn't appreciate what a good thing he's (her cradle-snatching boyfriend, Colin) got, that's 100% your business; I just thought you'd be smart enough to know that you deserve better'. Great words to say to the 17yr-old skanks in the audience too, but I'm wondering what will poor Miles do when he discovers that his skank really wasn't smart enough? Tyler is a surprisingly good fit into their group as he becomes Miles' 'wingman', much as he (used to be) Mac(Damaine Radcliff)'s 'wingman' at home; and he also gradually completes the first couple when Nora's boyfriend Brett(John Henderson) bails--on the school, his girlfriend, and his music partner Miles--to egotistically advance his solo singing career.(1) Conversely, the movie also has a lot of social commentary about young people quitting everything they start. Obviously the propensity affects foster children more often, and Adler and Rosenberg must be commended for reaching out to such kids with their screenplay. Hope and self-worth is often what those kids need most if they are to end their days 'being better' adults than the circumstances they were born into.(2) Experienced choreographer/first-time director Ann Fletcher must be given enormous credit for pulling together a flawlessly edited 'great dance' movie that tells its feelgood story with honesty and social relevance. Fletcher's staging and editing is almost impeccable for.....a choreographer (she did cut the key introduction scene between Miles and Tyler too short for accents to instantly matter). Her cast consisted mostly of dancers whom she coaxed into acting, yet they all have great timing. Even the likable hunky lead, Channing Tatum(She's the Man(2006)), exhibits some well-captured on screen reactions, and Fletcher wrote the funniest line in the movie as romantic vulnerability for him: 'Is this where you, um (take me to) kill me?' However, although the falling-in-love montage is natural and honest, Tyler and Nora's continued sexual abstinence is perhaps unrealistic for a couple of dancers. It is, however, great social modeling.Thankfully the nightclub and finale scenes aren't disappointments, as is often the case in dance films. The first features a reworked Electric Slide that's surprisingly sold best by a vivacious (and not-so-well-hidden) blonde wearing a fuchsia tanktop and a baseball cap. Had she had more screen time, she'd have given Nora/Dewan a run for her money.The second proves the director's good judgment in leaving the finale unseen till the very end. The Senior Showcase features Kwane Holland's incredible classical-and-hip-hop mix track 'Bout_It (soundtrack on Jive Records). Additionally, the track delivers the talents of Nuttin'_But_Strings, the director's own discoveries. They're a couple of brilliant young male hip-hop violinists whom Fletcher drizzled throughout the movie.If Get Over It(2001) was Fame(1980) for junior high, Step Up(2006) acts as a Fame remake. It's so universally well-rounded and well-executed that it compares well to earlier minor dance classics Dirty Dancing(1986) and Footloose(1983).(9/10)",9,0,0,20 January 2009
