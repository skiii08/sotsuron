Scarface," Mob Movie Classic
","This movie is fantastic, Pacino is the only person who could have ever played this role and he was Oscar worthy for it, which will always puzzle me that he was never awarded for his best performances until 'Scent of a Woman' anyways back to Scarface. For its day i was very violent, hell it still is. Even though you don't see anything the Chainsaw scene will still make you want to turn away, but at the same time it has its kinder moments even when its mixed with violence. For example when they put the bomb in the car for the person they need to hit. When the guy they need to hit comes out he has his kids with him. Montana does not want to kill the kids, but the guy who holds the bomb is still planning on blowing them up. Montana gets angry and shoots the guy carrying the bomb because he does not want the kill kids. The only reason i gave this 9/10 instead of 10/10 is because there are often moments where you feel like you've seen them before. Maybe its just me and i need to see it again.",10,0,1,9 February 2008
Ben-Hur," I can see why people like it... but why!?!
","First of all this movie was just HORRIBLY boring. The chariot race is he only good thing in this movie. i will give the movie credit for that. i don't know how the hell they did that back than. Second, Charlton Heston is probably the most overrated actor to win an Oscar. maybe he just has a type of acting i just don't like... I still say Monty Python's Life of Brian is way way better. I guess the reason i probably don't like this movie is just because I am not a religious person and just don't care about movies like this. Overall if you are wanting to study film you should see this movie, its a very historical movie, but a great movie? no its not.",3,7,27,9 February 2008
