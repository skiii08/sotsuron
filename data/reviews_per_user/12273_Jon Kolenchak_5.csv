Vertigo," A One of a Kind Masterpiece
","There are several reasons why writing this review of Vertigo is difficult for me.  It has become my favorite film of all time. Bernard Herrmann (who wrote the film score) is one of my favorite composers, and to try to explain the film to someone unfamiliar with it without destroying the plot is absolutely impossible.I've seen several copies of the film over the years (in various stages of wear and tear), but if you have never seen this film before, be sure to get the completely restored DVD version.In a word, the film deals with obsession.  At the beginning of the film, Kim Novak plays a woman who is obsessed with the spirit of a dead woman.  Her husband, concerned for her safety hires James Stewart, a retired detective to trail her and keep an eye on her.  Stewart himself becomes obsessed with Novak.  It should also be mentioned that in the very first reel of the film, Stewart realizes that he has vertigo, and decides (also obsessively) to rid himself of that affliction.That's about all that one can say about this film without totally ruining it for someone who has never seen it.  It is the way that all the elements of filmmaking come together that make this a film like none other.  There are scenes in the film that, through the use of fog filters and extreme camera angles, one begins to feel as if the reality has vanished completely. There is a a scene in a graveyard, at the Golden Gate Bridge, and in a forest that have the texture of Impressionistic paintings 'come to life'.  Hitchcock so brilliantly weaves these reality and non-reality scenes together that the audience member soon has trouble identifying where one ends and the other begins.I believe that this is both James Stewart's and Kim Novak's finest acting achievement.  The range of emotions that each go through (especially Novak) will astound you.The score by Bernard Herrmann adds the perfect touch to this film, and I believe that without his contribution, the final result would have been much less effective.From the spinning Saul Bass credits at the beginning (which can be absolutely nauseating when seen on the big screen!) through the final scene, we see some very sincere characters end up coming full circle with their tragic destinies.Vertigo has so many layers to its structure that one must see the film several times to realize this.  It is a film that will never be the same once you have seen it the first time.  Even knowing that, it seems to grow and mature with each viewing.How I envy those who have not yet seen this film!",10,3,7,28 November 2000
Requiem for a Dream," Addiction Equals Hell... I Guess
","One complaint that I have with contemporary cinema is the dearth of empathetic characters onscreen.  Far too frequently do characters of depth and humanity appear.  When a film has both empathetic and non-empathetic characters it creates an interesting effect when trying to evaluate the total work.Requiem for a Dream involves both kinds of characters.  I found myself totally involved with Ellen Burstyn's character -- it had substance, meaning and was performed with a skill that far exceeded her co-stars.On the other hand, I could have cared less for the characters portrayed by Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly.  I found the juxtaposition of the Burstyn/Leto & Connelly stories fascinating, but I left the theater wondering what the director was trying to say.Granted, I assumed that we were to feel sorry for all these tragic people as we watched them going into their downward spiral.  Were each of these stories overlapped simply for comparison's sake?  Or, were we supposed to feel equally disturbed by the events in Burstyn's and Leto's?  It seemed to me that Leto chose his path deliberately while Burstyn tragically lost her way.Visually, the film is very striking, even if somewhat self-indulgent. (There came a point about midway through the film when I thought if I saw one more dilating pupil, I would lose my mind.)  And, although effective, the visual devices are not necessarily original, either.  Those who were impressed with the rapid cutting of the final portion of the film should take a look at D. W. Griffith's Intolerance -- a film made in 1916!  So much for 'cutting edge' (pun intended).All in all, an effective film, with Burstyn's performance a standout.",7,0,0,16 January 2001
The Others," Deja Boo
","As the lights dimmed in the theatre, I was prepared for Gothic mystery, the supernatural, and some good story telling.  To my surprise, I discovered that I was not seeing one film, but a combination of three that came to mind almost immediately.  Take 'The Innocents' (1961) mix with 'The Sixth Sense' (1999) and add a drop of 'The Night Has Eyes' (1942), and you have 'The Others'. Much of this film is derivative -- the religion-obsessed maternal figure, the sheltered young brother and sister, and the oh-so-accommodating hired help all set in a nice spooky old house perpetually surrounded by an eternal fog. There are a few plot threads left dangling, to say the least.  Discussing those would involve getting into some spoilers, which I never do in films of this type.  But then again, you'll probably figure the story out long before the characters on the screen do.",5,0,0,17 September 2001
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Overrated and Tedious
","I had high expectations for this film, based on media hype and word-of-mouth recommendations.  I found the general pace of it to be excruciatingly slow. There was a substantial lack of plot, and what existed seemed terribly contrived.  Granted, at times the film was beautiful to watch, and the fight sequences were impressive, but I found myself looking more at my watch than the screen after the first hour.  All the elements of the film's story: love, sacrifice, dedication, discipline, revenge, and personal choice can be found in many other films.  Don't waste your time on this one.",3,0,0,3 March 2001
Ben-Hur," De Mille-esque but without the histrionics and bad script
","When a film director is well known, he usually specializes in one genre. Everyone knows that Alfred Hitchcock made thriller/suspense films, that Cecil B. De Mille made epics, and so on.  Then along comes a director like William Wyler whose films include drama (These Thee, Jezebel), adaptation of a classic novel (Wuthering Heights), adaptation from the stage (The Little Foxes), comedy (How to Steal A Million), and even a musical (Funny Girl). It is said that Wyler decided to direct Ben-Hur because that would give him a chance to do a Cecil B. De Mille movie.  Well, he does C.B. one better.I have been a fan of the epic film since childhood in spite of how awful some of them can be.  There's something about a film produced on a grand scale with a cast of thousands set in an exotic location that I enjoy. The problem with these films is that they are many times poorly scripted, historically inaccurate, and even though they run between 3 and 4 hours, the characters never seem to get beyond the Technicolor cut-out stage. Despite these flaws, they sometimes can be awfully fun to watch.Ben-Hur is film that is extremely well scripted (there were a total of 3 writers working on the film, but only one got screen credit), well filmed, and well acted.  Charlton Heston in the title role gives such a sincere performance it almost makes me forget what a jerk he has become in his old age.  Stephen Boyd is great as the evil Messala, and Martha Scott does as good a job as Chucky's mother in this film as she did in The Ten Commandments, when Chucky was Moses.The film's score by Miklos Rosza is perhaps the finest film music that he has ever written.  It is somewhat leitmotific in technique, and goes on for much of the 212 minutes of the film -- always supplementing and accentuating the drama, but never overshadowing it.Without giving any plot elements away to those who may have not seen this film, the story deals with friendship, betrayal, revenge, and redemption. The sets are massive, the costumes beautiful, and the characters are people that you actually care about.  The film is one of those rare instances in cinematic history when a remake is as good as the original.  (Ben-Hur was first filmed as a full-length film in 1925.)This review is based on the newly released DVD edition, with which I have some negative views.  The print itself that was used for the DVD mastering has some amazingly glaring color fluctuations.  The color is also washed out in quite a few scenes, and in the scenes which are softly lit, there is a bluish or purplish haze over most of the screen.  One would think that a better copy the film negative existed for its debut on DVD, but perhaps not.The DVD is in widescreen letterbox format, which is the format that I prefer.  However, because it was originally shot in MGM Camera 65 (an extremely wide projection) the viewable area on your television is a very narrow band.  I suggest watching this on the largest TV you can find.If you enjoy this version of Ben-Hur, take a chance and watch the 1925 version.  You may be surprised how good a silent film can be.",10,1,3,31 March 2001
