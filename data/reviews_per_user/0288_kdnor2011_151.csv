The Blair Witch Project," Very Realistic and Very Creepy
","Blair Witch certainly is one of the polorizing movies. There is almost no middle ground when it comes to this film, you either love it, or hate it. For me, I'm on the love side. It certainly isn't the scariest film I've ever seen, but I love it's creativity and atmosphere that I'm willing to overlook it's flaws.This is not a jump scare type of horror film, it fact throughout most of the movie it doesn't really try to SCARE you really, it mostly tries to creep you out. So if you are not a patient person, and believe me, I'm not the most patient person in the world either, than you will hate this film. It can be very tedious at times, and kind of boring. Plus I think we needed at least one more day before the crew started going crazy, but maybe that's just me. And don't watch it with a headache, I did that and I wanted to vomit.What it does do well it make a realistic atmosphere. There are people who still believe this was real, showing how realistic this movie is. The characters, aren't really characters, they're real people. No really, not only are all the actors using their real names, but the directors didn't really give them a full script, they told the actors that the legend was real and would actually make noises to freak them out to make this as realistic as possible. And because of that, I felt sympathy for these three even though they were all kind of a$$holes. Their not movie a$$holes, they're real people a$$holes, and yes there's a difference. And the film has a sense of humor to it, this is actually kind of personal as when something bad happens to me I will sometimes try to add a little humor to the situation to make it seem less bad.The Blair Witch Project is not the scariest film ever made, it's more of a creepy film. What it does best is create a realistic atmosphere and characters that you can sympathise with, and leads to one of the best ending of all time, that leaves a bit up to the imagination. Plus, the backstory to this witch is very detailed and well thought out.8/10",8,1,4,6 May 2010
The Avengers," It really Impressed Me.
","If you had asked me a few months ago if I was exited for the Avengers, I would have said, 'A little bit.' But then the trailer made my jaw drop when I saw the giant snake decepticon from Transformers 3 crash through that building while chasing Iron Man. So I joined the many who got hyped for this film, in fact like many others I had an Avengers marathon leading up to it. And I can say that this is the best Avenger's movie we've gotten so far. It has everything I liked from the other five, while taking out some of the stuff I didn't.Let's just get a few problems I had out of the way. Like the other five, there are points where it does feel slow and gets a little boring, but they are few and far in between. At times it focused too much on one member and not enough on the others. Some of the effects were clearly CGI, and it might be a little too long. I know it's only about an hour and eleven minutes, but it did feel a little longer.Other than that, I really enjoyed this movie. The action scenes are great, especially the final battle. So much stuff gets destroyed. There was one shot that reminded me of that action scene in TinTin. Where they have one continuous shot go to all the members of the Avengers fighting. It doesn't last as long, but it was still cool. Most of the time the special effects were good. And I really liked the characters. Iron Man was hilarious, which is the way I think he should be, Robert Downey Jr. is great. Thor was a little more serious this time, and it actually worked, I don't know how, but it did. Black Widow was hot, Hawkeye was cool, and I actually really liked The Hulk, he had the absolute funniest scene in the movie. The acting all around is good, and I actually thought Loki was a great villain. In Thor he was OK, but I always knew Thor could beat him. In this, he actually gets pretty far, and it made me wonder how the Avengers would defeat him. And that is a big strength for this movie, there's actually quite a bit of suspense.I didn't think I would say this, but the Avengers is my favorite movie of the year so far. There are a few flaws, but overall I was very impressed with this movie. See it.",10,2,6,4 May 2012
National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Better than the first, and that's saying a lot
","I really like the first National Treasure, it was fun, exiting, and entertaining. But most sequels don't live up to the hype, but this is one that did. This sequel is entertaining, action, funny, and even a little educational.Nick Cage plays Ben Gates, a treasure hunter who's ancestor has been accused of killing President Lincoln. Not being able to believe it, he enlist the help of his friend Riley Poole, played by Justin Bartha. By the end his ex-girlfriend Abigal chase, and even his parents. It leads to all sorts of locations, like Bunckingham palace, the oval office, and Mount Rushmore.All the acting is top-notch, Justin Bartha is hilarious. Nick Cage is funny and a good action star. So why do a lot of people not like this. It has a very low rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and the basic consensus is 'A talented cast goes to waste in the improbable National Treasure: Book of Secrets, which is eerily similar to the first film.' Oh sure, its improbable, yeah because critically acclaimed films like Avatar, Harry Potter, District 9, The Dark Knight, and Jaws are all incredibly realistic. So, it's a treasure hunting movie, just throw reality out the window and enjoy it.",8,1,1,28 March 2010
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Liked it more than the first, but still didn't love it.
","Yes I am aware that these two films were originally supposed to be one film, but got split up. That still makes Vol. 2 a sequel, and it's one of those sequels that is better than the first.I liked the first Kill Bill, it was entertaining, thrilling, graphic, gory, and there were no gigantic plot holes, at least none that I saw. But it just wasn't my kind of movie, and this one kind of falls under the same category. With that said, I still like this movie more than the first.The movie follows the Bride, who has already knocked two people off her death list, with only 3 more to go. She tracks them down, kills, or blinds, one of them, after she already killed the fourth. So know she off to destroy the main man, Bill. But when she gets there, she meets someone that makes it much harder for the bride.Kill bill volume 2 is a good movie, and one I will probably watch again sometime in the future, along with the first one. But it isn't the greatest movie ever, but that's not neccesairly a bad thing.",7,0,1,9 December 2010
Black Swan," Extremely well Done
","I already knew the ending to this movie, because idiot told me. So I didn't have huge expectations for this movie, thinking that it would just be buildup for an ending that I already knew.Thankfully I was wrong, this movie had so much tension, I love the main character, and absolutely loathed the dance teacher. The dancing was fun to watch, since I'm not a fan of ballet. Also the acting was extremely good, Natalie Portman, Mila Kunis, both did great jobs, boy has Portman come a long way from the Star Wars prequels.But the reason I love this movie is the plot. The way it unfolds, and the twists and turns make this a movie that is more confusing than Inception. Well, almost. The movie isn't about the ending, it's about the build up to the ending. So even though some dick on Youtube told me the ending, I still gave a round of applause to this film when it was over.",8,2,3,17 June 2011
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," The Best since the First
","I, like a lot of people, absolutely love the first Pirates of the Caribbean. It was one of the most entertaining movies I've ever seen, and gave birth to one of my favorite movie characters, Captain Jack Sparrow. But unlike a lot of people, I really enjoyed the second and third movies in the franchise, especially the third. Now we have, On stranger Tides, and it is my personal favorite since the first one.In this film, the focus in entirely on Jack, no Will and Elizbeth Relationship, although there is a different relationship between a religious man and a mermaid. The movie is basically Jack trying to find the fountain of youth, along with his ex Angelica. Unfortunaly Blackbeard the pirate also wants to find the fountain, as well as the Spanish government, and the British Parliment. Don't let this plot fool you, this film is much less confusing than the last two.It's funny as well, Jack is still great, and the film, overall, was entertaining. Lots of battles, sword fights, and the mermaids were awesome. Really my only big problem was the villain, what a bore.",8,0,2,8 July 2011
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Better than the First
","I haven't seen the first Sherlock Holmes in a while, I bought it as a blind buy and when I watched it, I thought it was pretty good, but stopped short of greatness. I just thought that the villain was kind of lame, I mean we knew who he was, and it seemed that he was not smart enough for Holmes. This film fixes that, it is way more interesting this time to see Holmes try to outwit him, because Professor Moriarty is pretty much Holmes equal.Everything that I liked in the first Sherlock Holmes movie is present here. The best part being the chemistry between Holmes and Watson, Downey Jr. and Law must have known each other all there lives, because they have some of the best on screen chemistry I've seen in a film. The action scenes are fun, although one of my problems is that director Guy Richie uses way too many slow motion shots, and shows way too much. However the comedy almost never misses, this is one of the funniest movies I saw from last year. Robert Downey Jr. steals the show, he is now one of my favorite actors, and the Sherlock Holmes character is one of my favorite movie characters. The film always keeps you guessing as to how Holmes will escape, and when it ends, I had a huge grin on my face because of how brilliant it was.Like I said, the action scenes can be annoyng at times and there are a few boring parts, and Watson's wife seemed entirely pointless and just slowed the movie down, but I enjoyed this film, and I await a third movie.",8,0,2,23 February 2012
The Incredible Hulk," It was Good...that's really all I can say
","This was actually the last Avengers movie that I watched, I saw it for the first time a couple months ago, and my opinion really hasn't changed much. Basically all I can say is, The Incredible Hulk is good, it wasn't great, wasn't bad. The film doesn't have many bad things, but it also doesn't have many great things.I'm not kidding. The acting is...good. The characters are fine. The special effects are good but nothing mind blowing. The action scenes are entertaining enough and well shot but didn't enthrall me. The villain is good. I liked the way it tied into the Avengers. The film was just...good.There are really only a couple of things I didn't like. One was Liv Tyler, for the most part she wasn't bad, but at times she was so bland and it didn't even seem like she was trying. And the other...the first two thirds take themselves a little too seriously. I don't mean to say every major blockbuster has to be part comedy. But come on this is a film needed a little more humor. And we kind of get that in the last third with Dr. Blue. I liked this guy, he was really funny. But the humor seemed really out of place when compared to the rest of the film. Also, what happened to Blue, is he going to be in the Avengers? The Incredible Hulk is a good popcorn movie. Not one I'll be watching over and over, but it doesn't really have much wrong with it. It just doesn't have many great things in it.",7,0,1,30 April 2012
Mission: Impossible III," A lot of Fun
","I liked the first Mission Impossible, but there is no use denying that it was way more confusing that it needed to be. And as of today I have yet to see the second one, although I heard it wasn't that good.Mission Impossible 3 is directed by J.J. Abrams who produced and wrote one of my favorite movies of all time, Cloverfield. He is more known for his work on Television with Lost, Alias, and Fringe, but I never watched those. And I think he does a wonderful job of continuing the Mission Impossible franchise.Sure there is a lot of shaky cam, which I can't stand in movie, but most of the movie is watchable. The action scenes are a lot of fun, and the story is well written. I'm not a huge Tom Cruise fan, but I can safely say I liked him in this movie. And one thing that makes this movie better than the first...It's not that hard to Understand.",8,0,1,16 December 2010
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Really good, is bashed too much
","I have heard so, many bad things about this film, from movie critics, critics on the internet, most people see this as a failure. Even if people like the film, they still consider it the worst of the series. Personally I think ROTJ is the worst (don't get me wrong, it's really good) and this movie is fun to watch. It needs to begin the story of Star Wars, and that's what is did, it showed how Anikan grew up, why Obi-wan taught him, and showed how 3P0 and R2 met. Sure Jar-Jar can be a little annoying, but he isn't the worst thing ever put on screen. The effects were amazing, Lucas put a lot of effort into them. So why do people not like it. Do I think it's the worst of the series, no, I don't even think it's the worst of the prequels. It's fun, entertaining, and does all that it need to do, start the story.",9,13,22,30 March 2010
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," A step backward in the Francise
","I'm not a Twilight Fan, or a Twilight hater, I just don't care. I didn't like the first film, it wasn't horrible but it was just so boring. Then I saw the second one, and was surprised, it wasn't really good, but it was entertaining at parts. Then Eclipse, I would actually call that film OK. So you see where this is going, each film got progressively better, so I was hoping that this film would go into the category of pretty good. It didn't.This film takes a step backwards, I'm not sure if it's better or worse than the first one, but it's pretty lame. It's kind of sad because there were actually some pretty cool things in this movie. Maybe it was just me, but when Bella was getting ready to walk down the aisle, it kind of looked like she was having second thoughts about marrying Edward and literally throwing her life away, that was pretty cool. The action scenes are fun, but there aren't enough of them. And Bella cares about someone besides herself, that alone makes gives this film a couple of points. And the ending shot was pretty cool.But as for the bad, there is not enough material for a two hour movie. There are so many scenes that have no purpose and just drag on for too long. Also, the acting is bland. I actually like the three main actors, I've liked Kristen Stewart and Robert Paterson in other movies, and I think Taylor Lautner might be able to act, but the dialog they are forced to speak is just awful. Edward keeps referring to his child as a thing. And there are some incredibly stupid moments, including a scene where the werewolves communicate telepathically. Guys, that may work in the book, but in a movie, that just looks stupid. And someone pointed something interesting out, if Edward is dead, that means he has no blood, thus he can't get an erection to get Bella pregnant.Overall this movie was incredibly forgettable. It had some interesting parts, but it was pulled down by too many scenes that had nothing to do with the plot. Bland acting, awful dialog, and way too many stupid moments. Let's just hope part 2 will be better. From what I hear (I didn't stay after the credits), Dakota Fanning is supposed to be the villain of the next movie.",4,5,6,25 February 2012
Source Code," Unique and fun
","As of now, this is my third favorite movie of the year.I love the premise of this film, and in my opinion it is pulled off very well. A man is part of a program that allows him to go into another man's body, 8 minutes before the train he is on blows up. IN that 8 minutes, he must find the person who set up the bomb, before the same man tries to blow up something else in Chicago. But as he begins to bond with one of the passangers, he wonders, what is the point, when every person he sees on the train is already dead, with no chance of coming back to life.This movie could've been very repetitive, but because of the great story, every second feels important. And it's also just a fun movie to watch for the action and explosions. And the twists are done very well, I never figured out what was going on.",9,1,3,12 August 2011
Catch Me If You Can," OK, but my least favorite (and most overrated) Spielberg film
","I'm normally not one who likes movies based on true stories, there are some that I like, but for the most part I just couldn't care less. However Steven Spielberg made one that I truly liked under the name of 'Shindler's List.' So if there was one person who can make a great movie based on a true story it would be him. Well, unfortunately, 'Catch me if you Can,' is not only Spielberg's most overrated movie, but his worst film to date. Now keep in mind that there are some that I haven't seen, like 1941, which is considered his worst.The reason I really don't think this movie is that great, is that it just isn't that interesting to me. This was praised as a hugely entertaining chase film, and at times it is, but for the most part its just not interesting.Is it bad, no. The acting is top notch, Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio do very good jobs here. And there were no plot holes, at least from what I saw.",6,0,4,19 June 2011
The Hangover," Hilarious
","Let me tell you, I watched this movie after my little brother and sister. So of course, before I could watch it, they kept telling me all the jokes, so when I watched it, I thought I had heard all the jokes. Boy was I wrong, though it wasn't as funny because some jokes were ruined, but there were plenty of jokes that I laughed out loud at. This movie was funny, that's all there is to it, it's funny. You got the fat guy, the nerd, and the wise ass, it follows the clichés, but it still stays fresh. Ironically my favorite character was Doug who was only in 1/4 of the movie, but that's just because I love Justin Bartha. Can I say it's the funnies comedy of all time, no, but it was the best of 2009, in the top five of the decade, and top ten of all time. It's funny, entertaining, and puts a smile to your face.",8,1,2,1 April 2010
Raiders of the Lost Ark," A very good Adventure Film
","I would consider myself a casual fan of the Indiana Jones movies. I enjoy them and watch them on occasion but don't go around quoting them or thinking about them all the time. That being said I do have to agree with the majority of people that the odd numbered Indiana Jones movies are definitely better than the even numbers. And while Last Crusade is my favorite, I will say that Raiders of the Lost Ark is a pretty damn good movie.My biggest issue is that the film has a bit of a pacing problem in the first half. You start out with a very cool and suspenseful action scene, and then we just sort of watch people talking for about twenty minutes, then a small action scene, more talking. And then the second half kicks in and the pacing gets better. I don't mind talking in films, but the stuff Indy talks about here isn't that interesting to me. Also I think that the climax is kind of lackluster after such build up. We get all this build up and then they have a stand off until Indy just sort of gives in. And how did Indy know to close his eyes? Other than that, the movie is pretty much perfect. I can't really find any problems in the writing, no annoying characters, every character is well developed and likable, except of course for the villains who are fantastic, I actually found myself hating them and wanting to reach in and punch them. The action scenes are choreographed perfectly, and there a feeling of suspense. The acting is perfect, I saw this after having Harrison Ford set in my brain as Han Solo, yet when I watch this I don't see Han Solo I see Indiana Jones. Most of the special effects hold up well, and it has a nice sense of humor to itself.While I may get blasted for not giving this film a perfect score I will say Raiders is a great adventure movie that just falls a little short in the pacing department. And seriously, how did Indy know to close his eyes?",8,1,2,20 December 2012
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Movie Magic
","I'm not normally one to bash other people's opinions, but if you dislike this movie, than you had better have some damn good reasons for it. E.T. is one of those movie that I just can't see anyone disliking, it's pretty much perfect in every way. Yeah there are parts that are better than others, but I can't understand disliking it.Are there any problems? Well I guess the only reason someone could dislike it is because it tries way too hard to tug at your heartstrings. It may be a little too sentimental.But you know what this movie can be as overly sentimental as it wants. The relationships between everyone in the movie are perfect. The relationship between E.T. and Elliot makes it almost heartbreaking when they get sick. Elliot and his siblings relationship is perfect, that is exactly how siblings act. The kids with their mother. It all works. The special effects are amazing, it's hilarious, and to date, has the scariest scene in any movie as far as my opinion goes. THe scene in the weeds where Elliot finds E.T. is still scares me.Is there any more reasons to keep talking, everyone knows this movie is great, and if you don't...well, that's your opinion I guess, but I still find it weird.",10,0,1,17 March 2010
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Not as infuriating as Wanted, but still pretty bad.
","I had low, and I mean LOW expectations for this movie. Not because of any reviews, but because this movie is directed by Timur Bekmambetov, who's last movie 'Wanted,' infuriated me to my core and is currently my least favorite movie of all time. Now the idea for this movie, seemed like it could be a fun, action, guilty pleasure type of flick along with something like Transformers, but man this movie was annoying. Like I said, I went in with, well, absolutely no positive expectations, and it's a good thing too. Well this movie was bad, it didn't tick me off like 'Wanted' did. Oh this is currently the worst movie I've seen so far this year, but it was mostly because the film was annoying and boring.Here's the thing, I can't stand Timur Bekmambetov's style of direction, it annoys the crap out of me. Basically, he films all his action scenes the same way. He starts off in some slow motion, and then speeds it up for a quick second and then goes normal after the cool part has happened. This can be used very well if it is done right, but Bekmambetov just does it so frequently that it becomes annoying. He also adds so much CGI, and it all looks incredibly fake. Just like the bullets in Wanted, everything in here, including the Vampires were very cheap looking. And most of the time, I couldn't even tell what was going on in the fight scenes. The characters are forgettable, there is one character I liked, and I'll get to him later. Benjamin Walker and Mary Elizabeth Winstead have no chemistry and just come off as bland. It's very inconsistent, the (Spoilers) Vampires have the power to turn invisible. How? Never explained. But if they can turn invisible, and they know that Lincoln is president, so why don't they just turn invisible, sneak into the white house and bite him. Also, I thought Vampires couldn't have they're pictures taken, yet they have dozens of pictures of one taking off his glasses. I'm no history nut, so I don't know how well this fits into history. But I did do a little research and found out that Lincoln had four sons, and only one was in the film. Granted one died like 10 years before the civil war, but wouldn't it be nice to acknowledge the rest of them besides William. And finally it's just a bore. It's not the most boring film I've seen all year, but basically, why am I watching this? To see Abraham Lincoln kill Vampires, and do I get that? Well through half the movie we follow young Lincoln, who I couldn't care less about. Then we get to the Lincoln we all recognize with the beard and hat, but for most of the second half he doesn't do anything interesting, he just sort of stands around and tries to figure out how to win the war. This might be good in a documentary of Lincoln, or a biography, but in a movie called Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, I want to see Lincoln killing Vampires. And the movie takes itself way too seriously. Yes, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is played straight. What part of that title makes it sound like it was meant to be played straight? The only time Lincoln, the one we recognize, fights is in the last half hour, and even then, his friend does most of the work.Speaking of which, William Johnson is the one character in this movie I cared about. He's played by Anthonly Mackie, who ironically played the only character I cared about in the Hurt Locker as well. He actually has some pretty cool moments, and I actually felt sorry for him a few times. In terms of production value it is a pretty good looking film. The costumes, make up and sets all do look pretty nice. And I will give Bekmambetov this, he can really shoot one hell of a train crash. The train crash in this, and in Wanted were both the best parts of the movie. And to this movie's credit they saved that part for the end and not in the middle.Overall this movie wasn't as quite as infuriating as I thought it would be. But that doesn't mean it's good. Like with Wanted, I would forgive this movie if it were entertaining, but it really isn't, it's a bore. As bad as Wanted was, it at least gave you what it promised, it was bad, but it did give you plenty of action. I don't hate Timur Bekmambetov as a person, I don't know him personally. But his style annoys the hell out of me. But to be fair he isn't the only one at fault here, the moronic writers who played this movie straight deserve an equal part of the blame.2.5/10",3,1,4,16 October 2012
One Hundred and One Dalmatians," The Best Animated Disney Movie of Walt's Time
","When I was a kid, Disney's animated 101 Dalmatians was my favorite movie of all time. I absolutely loved it and watched my VHS copy of it so much that I could quote the movie from beginning to end. A couple of months ago I decided to re-watch the film, and I wasn't disappointed.Sure it no longer is my favorite movie, nor my favorite animated movie, or even my favorite movie in the Disney Animated Canon. But man this movie brought back a great nostalgic feel. There are many reasons why this film works. One is the villain, she is so horrible that you just want the dogs to rip her face off. The two hero's, Pongo and Perdita are also really good, as shown by the lengths they will go to save their children. The puppies are cute. And even the humans have enough charm for me to like them. And all the side characters are great too.The animation is really cool, for a movie made in 1961 it really looks like it was made no earlier than 1988. There are some really good jokes, the action scenes are fun, but the main reason this movie works is it's characters.",9,2,3,10 January 2012
Minority Report," Not great, but no where near horrible
","Confused Matthew is an internet critic that reviews movies that the majority of people liked, and he hated, such as BTTF 2, Lion King, and 2001: a space Oddysey. And he has said that this movie is the worst movie he has ever seen in his entire life.Now while the film isn't great, I don't think it's terrible. It looks great, as most Spielberg movies do, the actings pretty good, the special effects are great, and the plot isn't horrible. It's Sci-fi, so your supposed to suspend your disbelief, but this does go a little far. But hey, Wanted ripped this movie off, and made it a thousand times worse.Plus there are few plot holes, such as his eyes working when they should've deactivated them, and the ending doesn't make much sense, but the film is no where near horrible.",6,1,2,11 August 2011
Kung Fu Panda," Surprised by how much I liked it.
","I really thought I was going to hate this movie, just by the premise. I thought it was just going to be a bunch of fat jokes, tied into a cliché and unfunny movie. Boy was I wrong, I mean it did have quite a few fat jokes, but they weren't as many as I thought. There are a few cliché parts, but it's seems to be playing around with those clichés. And the best part, it's actually funny. I mean it isn't the funniest animated movie ever made, or even the funniest one Dreamworks has made, but it got quite a few laughs out of me.My biggest problem with the movie isn't that there's too much of the Panda, but that there's too little with the furious five. The Furious Five were pretty awesome in my opinion, I mean the best part of the movie is when there fighting the villain on the bridge. I haven't seen the sequel yet, but I here there's a lot more of them. I didn't really have any problems with the panda, but he seems to be a walking fat joke, which are just a step below fart jokes.7.5/10",8,1,1,28 June 2011
Mulan," One of my favorite Disney Movies
","Mulan seems to be one of those Disney animated movies that everyone seems to like, but no one seems to love. It was one of those movies of the Disney Renissance that didn't get the praise of their earlier movies like Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast and Lion King. Well personally, I love this movie, I actually prefer it to Beauty and the Beast and Little Mermaid, two movies that tried to be femenist. Sure there are a few things that I can nitpick about, but this movie just works so well for me.First the characters: Mulan is a kick-ass heroine that is the best female lead Disney has had in, well, ever. Seriously Belle, Ariel, Jasmine, Nala, Snow White, Cinderella, Aurora, they all did almost nothing. Mulan on the other hand killed Shan Yu with a fan. All the army members are good, if kind of forgettable. Shang is a hero who doesn't upstage Mulan. Mushu can be really Funny at times, but probably the funniest character was Mulan's grandmother.Next, the animation: It may not be Disney's best animation ever, but it still looks really good.The songs: while a couple are kind of forgettable, I absolutely love 'I'll make a man out of you.' And both 'A girl worth fighting for,' and 'Reflection,' are good as well.The action scenes are fun, the comedy really works, and it has a good message about femenism.",8,1,1,1 February 2012
Unbreakable," Kinda overrated
","So, a lot of you are probably asking, why, why do I like The Happening and The Last Airbender more than Unbreakable Easy, its BORING!!! The film is one of the most depressing, unsympathetic movies I've seen. There are maybe two comedic moments, the rest of the movie is just mean. Samuel L. Jackson has a disease that makes it so his bones break easily. Bruce Willis is stuck in a stupid job with a wife he is considering divorcing, and this causes major distress in their son. And then Bruce Willis is in a train accident, and this is all in the first 5 minutes. You see, this is why Signs works, not only is Signs one of my favorite movies of all time (don't listen to Doug Walker), but it's one of the best thrillers ever made, in my opinion. Because it added comedy to balance the horrible stuff that was happening. Like the author of the book being named Bimboo and the fact that they use aluminum helmets to stop the aliens from reading their minds. In my opinion Lady in the Water is Shyamalan's worst because that film also doesn't have much comedy, but that film has other problems. People say the Happening went too far on the comedy, but I think that film had an even balance, for a b- movie. In fact weren't people complaining that The Last Airbender took itself too seriously, Last Airbender had a few more comedic moments than people remember, and there wasn't as much horrible stuff happening, and that movie had an entire race of air nomads being wiped out. Going back to Signs, one of the problems people have is that the aliens were allergic to water, it was their poison, so why come to a planet in which the air is water? Personally I think that's a stupid argument, especially if you like any of the versions of 'The War of the Worlds.' In which the aliens are killed by bacteria, which is also everywhere. But for those people (Doug Walker) why do you defend this movie. Bruce Willis' weakness is water, so since the air is water, why doesn't it weaken him, I'm not saying kill him, but why not weaken him so he is, well, Breakable? Like I said, doesn't bother me, but I know it should bother some people. I'm not going to say the twist ending stunk, but once again, it just depressed me. For a few minutes, Bruce Willis is happy, but then, nope, no more. One more thing, why is it that Willis sees a woman rob a jewelry store and a man rape someone and not do anything about it, I mean he saw that the drug dealer (played by Shyamalan himself), and tried to stop him before this, and saw that man break into a house after wards, so why not stop them. What really ticks me off is when people call this film underrated, I consider a film underrated when when it either doesn't make much money, it gets more hate than it deserves, or people don't talk about it. Well the film made over $200,000,000. It got a 68% and a 7.3, and people talk about it, a lot of people, calling it underrated. Shyamalan was never the best writer (even with Sixth Sense, seriously any one can not say SPOILERS Bruce Willis is dead, but it took a great director to hide that fact), but he is one of my favorite directors. The film overall looks amazing, the actings not bad, the soundtrack kicks ass, and the premise is absolutely amazing, but the story, while still OK is overrated.",6,0,0,1 April 2010
Fight Club," Is there some deep meaning I'm not getting?
","Before we start, I should tell you all that I have actually only seen this movie one, and that was around a year and a half ago, so I am mostly going on memory. Also there will be spoilers.Is Fight Club a good film? Yeah...there's really nothing bad about it's plot or anything. Is Fight Club and Overrated film? In my opinion...yes. Sorry, I know there are a lot of people who absolutely love this film, but it is currently number 14 on the IMDb top 250.OK, first off, this movie does look really good, it has a gritty look to it that matches the tone of the film perfectly. And yes, I did really like the twist ending, I never saw that coming. However there are two really big pet peeves about this movie that get to me, and really brought this movie down hill.One problem is this: What is this movie trying to say? Don't tell me this is just supposed to be a popcorn movie, this movie is trying to say something, but I'm still not sure what. Is fighting good? Is fighting Bad? Can severe depression lead you to do a lot of crazy stuff? Are children films becoming to sexual (insert Mr. Poppers Penguin joke here.)? I guess the big question it tries to raise is what will happen if the US economy started over, but I'm still not sure that was even the question it brought up.My second big problem was the ending, and this is where the spoilers will be in full force. Now this movie tries really hard to be realistic, which for most of the movie it does really well. But after Tyler is revealed to be in the main character's mind, the movie sort of gives up.How does shooting yourself in the mouth get rid of Tyler? And how do you survive a shot to the mouth, you don't, and even if you did, you be in way too much pain to talk. Also I'm not an expert on the economy, I know very little on how the nations' economy works, but I'm pretty sure that destroying half of New York City, the city that controls the nations economy wouldn't start everyone over, it would screw us more. Isn't that what the terrorist were trying to do on 9/11. So basically, the characters in this film caused an event that was even worse than 9/11. Think how many people must of died, even if the bulding were empty the smoke, the debris, it must have made one hell of a mess. Basically, the Fight Club is worse than Al Queda.I'm still gonna dwell on this. Where did they get that many bombs. They would literally need thousands of bombs per building. They came down in seconds.OK, maybe I'm being too hard, maybe the writer thought that bombs would work. But wait didn't a terrorist group try to bring down a the twin towers with bombs in 1993? And they failed.OK, I think that's about it, there are some small nitpicks I have, but the questionable moral and the ending just completely made me forget. Fight Club is good, if you love the movie, good for you, but I will not be buying it any time soon.",7,3,8,19 June 2011
Memento," Christopher Nolan's Masterpiece
","This is Christopher Nolan's masterpiece, his best film, the one that I like the most. He has made some really great movies, but none have been as good as this. Not only is this my favorite Nolan movie, it's one of my favorite movies of all time.What don't I like, well, I guess there are a few times where you can get confused. And at times the narration may feel unneeded, but those are really only small nitpicks.The best part about this movie is the way it's shown, it's not a straight narrative, there are black and white scenes that go straight, but then the color scenes go backwards, all setting up this mystery. Nolan tried to do that with his first movie, 'Following,' but this is where he perfected it. The mystery is very well done, and actually gives the movie more re-watch value, I've seen the movie several times and still don't know exactly what happened. The acting is great all around, Teddy ads some really good comedic relief, the cinematography and editing are excellent.There's not much to say without spoiling anything, please if you haven't seen this movie, go see it, it really is a fantastic movie, and in my opinion, Christopher Nolan's best.",10,1,2,9 December 2010
Inglourious Basterds," Just Like Kill Bill, Liked, didn't Love
","What can I say, pretty much everything I said for the Kill Bill movies is seen here. There don't seem to be any plot holes, the characters are fine, the the actings good, the action scenes are cool, and the dialog is as good as it is in any Tarantino movie. But for some reason I just didn't love it.Maybe it was because it was too violent for me, but that doesn't make much sense because I like the Final Destination films, and they have tons of violence. I didn't have any problems following the plot, and I absolutely loved to hate the villain, but why didn't I love this film.I guess it just isn't my type of movie, for what it was, I had fun watching it, and may watch it again someday, but overall I just didn't love this film. It could be one of the greatest films I've ever seen, but I just don't care.",7,0,1,27 June 2011
Coraline," Very Creepy
","When people think 2009 in animated movies, they probably think of Pixar's Up, it went on to win best animated feature and even got a best picture nomination. Well as great as Up was, I have to disagree with the Academy, because Coraline was my favorite animated film of that year. This has to be one of the creepiest animated films I have ever seen. According to Doug Walker, Don Bluth had a saying that you can show kids as much dark stuff as you want as long as it all leads up to a happy ending. If that's true, than Coraline is like a modern day Don Bluth movie.OK, negatives first, Whybie got annoying at times, it has a few immature moments that clash with the dark tone and it doesn't work, and it might be a little too dark for kids.This is a creepy flick, the colors and lighting really add to the dark atmosphere. The relationship between Coraline and her parents is actually really good, that is how kids really act, granted real kids might swear a little more, but this film shows a real relationship between parents and kids. The characters are a lot of fun, and acted very well. It's pretty funny at times, and even has a catchy song from the other father. Plus it's nice to see animation that isn't computer generated in this day and age.Coraline is one of the creepiest, and best animated films I've ever seen. It ranks up with some of Disney and Pixar's best flicks. Although I actually think it might scare young children, so if you have a child under 10, you might want to watch it with them.",9,4,4,21 April 2011
Iron Man 2," Personally, I thought it was better than the first
","I know I will get a lot of hate for this, but I actually liked this movie more than the first. Now I'm not saying that this film is better than the first, I guess in terms of writing, this is the worst film. However, I had more fun watching this movie. To me, this was the more fun of the two.Now it isn't a perfect film by any means. Pepper Potts wasn't great in the first film, but in this film she seems to have two modes. She's either annoying, or she is a complete idiot. I'm sorry, but if a droid ten feet away from me begins beeping and blinking red, I won't just stand there and look at it, I'm running away as fast as I can. Also, like the first film, there is way more talking then action, in fact there's even less action in this film.However that brings me into the good stuff. While this film has more talking than action, I actually liked the talking. Robert Downey Jr. was hilarious, he always had me smiling. And because of this, despite Stark still being a douche, I liked him a lot more. The film is just full of witty banter. So I liked when there was action and when there wasn't action. And once again my favorite character was Rhodey, once again reminding me of myself. Scarlett Johansen was hot. The two villains made the perfect antagonist. Ivan was intimidating, and Hammer was funny. And I liked the story. It's basically part Iron Man movie, part trailer for the Avengers, and for me it worked.I can't really see why this film was hated by so many people. Sure it has good reviews, and most people seem to like it. But of all the Avengers movies, this one seems to get the most hate. I really enjoyed this movie, it isn't perfect, and the first film is probably a better film, but I enjoyed this movie more.",8,3,4,18 January 2011
The Hunger Games," A Fantastic Adabtation
","When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I said to myself, 'yeah, that looks interesting, might check it out on DVD.' Over the next few months the hype exploded for this film, and then for my birthday I got the first book. And after reading it, it completely lived up to the hype. It had everything, action, romance, drama, gore, political satire, the only thing it might have needed more of is comedy.So by the time I got to chapter five, I knew I wanted to see this movie as soon as possible, and I just watched it, so it's fresh in my mind.This could very well rank up as one of the best adaptations I've ever seen. This ranks up there with the Harry Potter series, and is actually better than a few of those. Every thing the book has, this film has, action, drama, romance, it doesn't have too much gore, but it is a PG-13. There are some things left out, and some things were changed, but that's just necessary.The book is in first person, so the fact that this movie obviously can't be, both works for the film, and against it. I liked the fact that they showed inside the control room, and really liked when District 11 began to fight back. But since we can't read Kaniss' thoughts, we have to rely on flashbacks and dialog. Most of the time it works, but sometimes I feel that if you haven't read the book you may be lost.I just hated the capitol, the fact that they can show private conversations just makes them even more unlikable.I love the way the people in the Capitol dress, it's so over the top that it's hilarious. And the film also really made me hate the girl from District 1, Glimmer. As well as a few others from the alliance. The rest kill because they want to live. But it just seems like these people do it for the fun of it.The acting is great, the special effects are well done, and There are a few things I didn't like, the shaky cam did get annoying at times. It seemed that the last twenty minutes were kind of rushed. And did I miss a few tributes deaths, because it seems they went from 24-11-10-6... Also, and this is personal, because I just finished the book a couple days ago, I knew exactly what was going to happen, so there wasn't much suspense. But that isn't a problem with the film, and I chose to read it.Overall, I was very pleased with this movie. I couldn't decide if it was better than Chronicle or not, but in the end I put it ahead. Meaning this is my favorite movie of the year so far. I will definitely be getting this movie when it comes out on DVD/blu-ray, and I can't wait to read the next two books, and if those are good, then I can't wait to see the next two movies.",8,4,16,24 March 2012
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," A not so good sequel, but still fun
","Pirates of the Carrabean: Dead man's chest still has the action, adventure and comedy, but isn't as good as the first or third. Most people would either say the second or third films in the POTC franchise are the worst, and for me, it's the second. It takes the main problem with the first film and multiplies it by five, it's hard to follow.Jack has a debt to pay to Davy Jones, so he has to give Jones a hundred souls or something. Then Will and Elizabeth are arrested, and instead of just killing them, they send Will to get Jack so he can get a real Job. But Jack need to pay off his debt, so he tells Will to help him get 100 souls, causing Will to be captured by Davy jones.Elizabeth escapes, and goes on a ship to find will and Jack. They find out that they need to find Davy Jones heart. They find it, but soon Jack, Will, and former Captain James Worrington all fight over the keys.Yeah, it's a weird movie, but as long as you don't think too deep into it, like I did, you should have a good time.",6,0,2,10 May 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Fun
","The first Pirates of the Carrabean is really entertaining. It has a lot of action, a lot of comedy, and a lot of special effects. All the characters are creative. Will Turner, a blacksmith trying to find his childhood friend, Elizabeth Swann, a hot heroine who certainly isn't a Damsall in Distress, and Captain Jack Sparrow, a wity, crazy pirate that can get out of any situation. There are many other characters too, but they would take too long too explain. My only problem with this film is the problem everyone seems to have with the third film, it's hard to follow. So I don't really care, I just watch the action, and effects. If you're one of the six people who haven't seen this movie, buy it on DVD, it's fun, entertaining, and is just plain great.",10,0,3,7 May 2010
Beauty and the Beast," It was Good, but kinda overrated
","I first saw Beauty and the Beast when the Diamond edition came out last year, when I was 17 years old. Maybe that's the reason I don't like this movie as much as everyone does, but I doubt it since I also saw Wall-e the same night and absolutely loved that film. Now when I first saw it, I was prepared to give this film a 6/10, but after thinking about it and listening to many peoples reasons why they love it I think it deserves at least a 7.The story is of two opposites that have a bad first impression but eventually fall in love. Simple, but it works. There are a few things that bother me about this film though. For one I feel that when the beast wasn't a jerk, he was really boring and bland, sorta the same thing that happened with Simba in the Lion King. I hate Lumiere alright, he is just a prick. And the songs aren't what they're hyped up to be. Be our guest is the only song that I loved, the rest are good, but I wouldn't sing along, and to be honest I don't see myself singing to Be our Guest either.But there are more good things, the love isn't just love at first sight, the rest of the characters are cool and the animation is stunning. Overall, good film, but not my favorite in the Disney Movie library.",7,1,3,21 April 2011
Ted," Really, really funny
","Say what you will about Seth McFarlane, but the man can be really, really funny. You know, when he's not shoving his liberal and atheist views down people's throats and making you feel like an idiot if you don't agree with him. I actually still do enjoy Family Guy, even though it's mostly hit and miss, but when it hits it can be comedic gold. American Dad is still a damn good show, and while I don't really watch The Cleveland Show anymore, I didn't think it was awful, it just got old really fast. So his first movie Ted, could either be really funny, or really annoing. Thankfully, I found myslef laughing quite a bit in this film.While it does have some jokes that follow the Family Guy formula of going on for a little too long, and the plot itself is nothing really knew. In fact Ted being a Teddy Bear didn't really affect the story as much as you would think, it comes up a few times, but for the most part it could just be a normal person and there wouldn't be much of a difference. Plus there's a couple of dry spots where there's way too much talking and drama and not enough comedy.But did I laugh, oh yes I did, I laughed at almost every joke in this film with either a laugh out loud or a small chuckle. Ted himself is actually a pretty likable character, yeah he can be a bit of a slacker, but he has a good heart. And the CGI work on him is really good. I like how it turned a few cliché's on their heads, like making you think that it was going to go in that way, and then explain why that wouldn't work. But like I said, the main reason to watch this is just because it's funny, sure this comedy may not appeal to everyone, but to me, I laughed quite often.Ted is easily one of the best comedys of the year, if you don't like Seth McFalane's style of comedy, you won't like it. But even if you felt Family Guy is completely awful now, you may be surprised by this film.",8,0,4,7 October 2012
Ed Wood," See this if You want to be a filmmaker
","If you, like me, at any point want to get into anything involving film, then you better watch this movie. The tale of what some people call the worst director ever will show how hard the film business can be. Tim Burton is very good at directing, and this film shows how much he loves film, as much as it show how much Ed Wood himself loved film.I have a couple of problems, one I was hoping to laugh more. I know this is a dramedy, and I chuckled a descent amount of times, but I was hoping to get a few bigger laughs. I wish Bill Murray was in it a bit more, Murray is always a funny presence. Also, despite the fact that the film ends on a happy note, I still felt sad. We all know what fate befell Wood, and it makes the ending depressing.Other than that, I really enjoyed this film. It really makes you feel sorry for Wood, he clearly loves movies and wants to make them, but the studios get in the way, and he never does a second take. Bela Legosi, despite being a bit mean at times, is very likable and you feel sad when he dies. I hope I'm not spoiling anything. The acting and direction are both great. And it really is good at showing how demanding the film business can be.If this is what Ed Wood was like in real life, than no he isn't the worst director. He tried hard, and clearly loved film. Look at Uwe Boll who knows he will always make money and fights his critics. Like I said, if you want to be a filmmaker, you really should see this movie.",8,1,1,7 May 2012
Insomnia," Pretty Underrated for a Nolan movie
","When it comes to Christopher Nolan's movies, Insomnia is often considered the weakest. Probably just because it's the only one of his movie's that he didn't write, he only directed. Personally I really enjoyed Insomnia, I would say it's one of my more favorite Christopher Nolan movies.Really the only big problem I have with the movie is that it's just kind of forgettable. That's the only thing I can really fault this movie for is that I forget a lot of the good stuff.It's been a while since I've seen this movie, but from what I remember, it had some really good suspense. I was always wondering how it was going to end, so in a way, being forgettable helps the movie because it allows you to go in each time and be able to enjoy the suspense. The acting was really good, I felt so sorry for Al Pacino. And it gave me a new look at Robin Williams that I haven't seen before. It was shot very well, and basically it's just a really good movie. It's not absolutely amazing, but it was suspenseful, entertaining, and well written and directed.",8,0,0,19 July 2012
The Day After Tomorrow," Another High budget great effects disaster movie
","Roland Emmerich has given us another disaster film. After ID4, Godzilla, and his latest film 2012, you could probably guess what it's about. A certain force is about to destroy the world, in real life it would be impossible to run away from an alien explosion, an earthquake, or a giant lizard. The day after tomorrow has own main characters running away from cold air. Tell me thats not the coolest and stupidest idea you've ever heard.None of Emmerich's movies are realistic, in this one they can survive freezing temperatures by hiding in a room with one fire. They outrun air, and the statue of liberty doesn't fall over when hit with a fifty foot high tsunami going 100 miles per hour.I recommend this movie, even if it is stupid, it's entertaining as Hell and you just got to have fun with it. It's a fun movie with an environmental message, what more do you want.",7,0,1,20 March 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Worst then the first, better then the second
","Pirates of the Carrabean: At Worlds End, a good cap on the trilogy, with all the action, adventure, and witty pirate humor you could want. Unfortunately, it has the same problem the other two had, it's hard to follow.With Jack in Davy jones locker, Will, Elizabeth and Barbossa all enlist the help of Soa Fang, the lead pirate of the South China Sea to help. With Bekket killing anyone convicted of piracy is in control of Davy Jones heart. Jack is rescued, but somehow Will is captured. Jack, Elizabeth and the rest of the crew go to the pirate capital, there they begin to have a battle on the sea. Will and Elizabeth are married in the battle, Will stabs Jones's heart and becomes the next Davy Jones.It's just as confusing as the other two, but it's still fun, it has great action, and it has a lot of laughs.",7,0,1,10 May 2010
The Prestige," Starts strong, then leads to a disappointing conclusion
","The Prestige is a perfect example of a film that starts off pretty damn good, but then falls flat at the end. It overall is worth watching, and is enjoyable and interesting in parts, but it isn't a masterpiece.I'm going to start with the stuff I liked this time, the acting is great, I really thought that Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman hated each other. The direction is great, it's a very good looking film, I think in terms of direction this is actually one of Nolan's better films. It has a good plot, even if it is far fetched. The production value is also worth noting, really feeling like the late 19th century, well except maybe Tesla in the middle, but that would be spoiling to much so I won't say what it does. Overall for the most part the movie works really well.Then at the end this movie decides to have a twist ending. I actually knew the twist before, so I was looking for clues, like something like THe Sixth Sense, and what I found out is that this twist ending doesn't make any sense at all. This isn't even really a twist, it's more of a 'got ya' moment. There's no clues, no lead up, the twist is just there so the movie can feel more cool than it needs to be. If any of you can explain how this twist makes any sense, please let me know.So yes, The Presige is a good movie for the most part, it starts off pretty strong, but then goes into a very disappointing conclusion.",7,0,2,19 July 2012
The Terminator," Awesome movie
","Hard to believe that James Cameron started out with something as small budgeted as The Terminator, and now he has directed the two highest grossing films of all time. Today a lot of people hate James Cameron because he has mediocre stories mixed in with amazing special effects, where as 30 years ago he brought us a very well done story about how technology may overthrow the human race one day.Now a few things I didn't like in this movie, it is a little bit slow, if you are very impatient you may not like this movie, but if you can get pass the slower parts you will find a really fun flick. I don't see why they couldn't just wrap laser guns in a piece of meat, I didn't see much purpose in following the police chief, he doesn't have much impact on the story, and it can be very depressing at times, and would have been nice to have a little more comic relief.I love stories that try to warn us about how we can mess up the future, either by government or technology. This film applies more today than it did back in 1984 now that we have Internet, cell phones, iPods and all that. The special effects are excellent, and this movie had a very low budget. The action scenes are good, but nothing groundbreaking, they get the story moving, but they're nothing special. And the characters are all interesting, weather you like James Cameron or not, you can't deny he knows how to make a strong female lead, and Sarah Conner is one of them. She starts out as a waitress who can't even do her job right, then becomes a bada** near the end.The Terminator is one of the best examples of how to make a film on a low budget. Both the story, and the special effects are great, the characters are interesting, and it's just a fun movie to watch. It's got a great look to it, and warns us how technology may turn on us one day.",9,2,3,1 September 2011
Cloverfield," Truly the best Camcorder film
","Now I love the 'found footage' style of filmmaking. Paranormal Activity, Blair Witch, Quarantine, all great films. But Cloverfield is not only my favorite of this genra, but it one of my favorite movies of all time, number 4 to be exact. How do I begin to describe why this movie kicks so much ass...First the characters: Every single one of these characters are likable. Even the ones that are supposed to be annoying like Hud, despite the fact that he annoys the rest of the characters by never stop filming, he's actually my favorite character because he just so funny. I actually felt sorry for some of these characters when they died. I actually named my cat Marlena, you probably won't get it, so if you want to know why exactly why I named it after her, ask me in the comments. I guess if you want to nitpick, the characters are kind of cliché, Beth is the damsel in distress, Marlena is the weird emo like chick, Hud is the frat boy who doesn't know when to shut up, but this never bothered me.The acting is top notch, these actors had not been in a lot of movies before this film started, but were absolutely great. Never did I think I was watching actors, I was watching real people, in a real situation. And the three actresses who play Marlena, Lily and Beth...smoking hot.The special effects are amazing, I mean it, there is not one part of this movie that I didn't believe was there. That doesn't happen, no matter how good a movie's CGI is, there is always at least one scene that I can tell is CG. That never happened here, maybe it was because it was dark, maybe it was the movement of the camera, but every special effects shot was perfect, and this movie did not have a big budget.The 'found footage' element is used very well here, I was never feeling motion sick. This movie has fun with the gimmick, as much as I love movies like Paranormal Activity, Blair Witch, and Quarantine, (hell I thought Apollo 18 was OK), those movies seem to take themselves to seriously with the gimmick, we know it ain't real, but they try so hard to convince us that they are. Cloverfield knows it's a movie and takes advantage of it.Speaking of fun, not only is this movie really, really funny at times, but the main reason I love this movie is because it is so much fun. It entertains me every time I watch it, and by the end I want to watch it again.I didn't get into the viral hype, and thus didn't see the movie until it came out on DVD. I really wish I had gone to see this movie in theaters. That's why I hope they make a sequel, I really, really want to see more of what happened that night. Please J.J. Abrams, I couldn't care less about Star Trek 2, make a sequel to this.And if you have the DVD or blu ray, there are some really cool Easter eggs on them.",10,2,4,1 March 2010
The Adventures of Tintin," Best animated movie of 2011
","We got a lot of good animated movies in 2011, Kung Fu Panda 2, Rio, Rango, and Whinnie the Pooh, but Steven Spielberg's, The Adventures of Tintin was my favorite. Maybe it is just because I'm a Spielberg fanboy and like anything he does. Not true, sure I haven't hated anything he has done so far, but I never saw 1941, and I wasn't a big fan of Catch me if you Can. Also, while I did enjoy them I was never the biggest fan of the Indiana Jones movies, they're fun, and I own them, but they didn't blow me away.Tintin is Spielberg's first animated film, and man was it a lot of fun. The action scenes are so well choreographed, and they are able to get angles that they can't get in live action. The films highlight is a motorcycle chase through Morocco, which is a three minute chase scene all in one shot, not one cut, and it was amazing.The acting is great, Andy Serkis plays Haddack and he is absolutely hilarious. But the one who steals the show for me was Snowy, he was funny as hell, and just so cute. And Thompson and Thompson have quite a few funny moments as well, although they aren't in the movie that long.But that's all well and good, but what about the animation. I have actually only seen two motion capture animated film before, The Polar Express, and Monster House, both of which I really liked. However this animation is done by the same studio that did Avatar, and it looks great. While I was pretty much always aware that I was watching a cartoon, the animation is so well detailed that I can totally see people being fooled by it.Tintin is one of Spielberg's best films, in terms of my personal favorites I would actually put this in front of Schindler's List. And there are supposed to be two more Tintin movies, the next one to be directed by Peter Jackson and produced by Spielberg, and the third to be co-directed by both of them, and I can't wait.",9,0,3,21 February 2012
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Definitely the worst of the series, but still very good
","I think the reason this movie is considered the worst of the original trilogy is because of the Ewoks, and that's fair enough. But still this is a really good movie and a perfect cap on the series. It resolves everything, and ends on a triumphant note. Some of my favorite parts are the final 3 way fight scenes with Leia and Han fighting on endor, Lando fighting a fleet of star cruisers while trying to blow up the Death Star, and Luke fighting Vader and the emporor on the death star. Another thing that lingers in my mind is the sound of the speeder bikes as they fly past. Like I said this is probably my least favorite of the series, not just the original trilogy, but of all six films, this movie is fun, but also has some stupid moments, or it could just be that I didn't want it to end, this movie is awesome, just, not as awesome.",8,0,2,30 March 2010
Final Destination 2," Not very good
","I...don't really like this movie very much. There is some stuff I like, but there is just too much stuff that doesn't add up for me. I just don't get why people consider this the best in the franchise, or at least the only good sequel. I can understand liking it, but I just can't see how you can like this and not like at least 3 and 5.First, some of the deaths scenes don't make sense. Why did Tommy do something as stupid as to run out into a construction site to chase pigeons. How is it that the elevator moves despite the the doors being opened. Also, there are a lot of things that don't add up. Why is it that death is going backwards. Kimberly and her friends died last in the vision and died first in real life (except for Kimberly who was saved.) Did I miss it, I've seen this film like three times and I still don't understand how that works. And while the idea of the first movie character's deaths saving these new characters from dying and thus death wants to kill them again, it basically means that death is an idiot. He messed up his own plan. The sucide doesn't make a damn bit of sense. And the ending sucked. Unless Bryan had that bone disease Samuel L. Jackson had in Unbreakable, I don't see how he would have died from that newsfan hitting him.But I don't hate this film, there are some deaths scenes that I really enjoyed such as the barb wire fence and the explosion in the hospital and even the fire escape was fun. The opening disaster was fantastic, I love the stuntwork and the effects. There are some funny moments. And it at least seemed like they were trying really hard to make this a good sequel.I don't hate this movie, but there are too many things wrong with it for me. If you like it that's cool, but I can't see how it can be considered the best in the franchise.",4,0,2,13 May 2010
The Polar Express," I watch it every Christmas
","Robert Zemenkis is well known for directing some of the greatest live action movies of all time. Back to the Future trilogy, Forrest Gump, Cast Away, but he has also done a few animated movies, and the one most people will point to first is 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit.' And while I do really enjoy Roger Rabbit I have to say that I like The Polar Express more, and I'm surprised that a lot of people dislike it, personally, I watch it every Christmas.Whenever someone critiques this film, they will mention how the animation on the human's is creepy, almost zombiish. And they are technically right, the eyes are a little weird and the skin is a little too pasty. But remember, this was the first time a full motion capture film was made. Plus it may try a little too hard to be a Christmas classic, I don't really think they needed a song, it's just there to make it more wimsical. Other than that, it's all nitpicking.Any piece of animation that isn't a human is amazing, it still looks fantastic, the colors, the detail, the amount of stuff going on at the same time. And even though the characters look a little zombieish, I still like them, they're likable, they're funny, and the fact that Tom Hanks plays like half the characters makes this one of the most likable movie's ever made. It's also a really good adabtation, everything from the book is mentioned but they also add fun little additions. Some of it may feel like filler, but I still enjoy it. And it's got a great feel to it, this movie feels like a Christmas movie, and not some cash grab.I watch The Polar Express every Christmas, I know it's a mixed bag with some people, but if you can get over the aged character design than it's a very enjoyable Christmas film that adds to the book it was based on.",8,1,3,1 September 2011
Tangled," I loved this movie
","I am pretty much in the far opposite group, that this movie was aimed at. I'm an 18 year old boy, who's graduating high school soon, and is worried about his future, why should I waste my time watching a fairytale. Well Tangled was fairytale I watched, and it made me feel like a kid again.First off, the animation is beautiful, Repunzul's hair looked so real, I wanted to reach into the screen and touch it. The characters are great, Flynn was the perfect jerk character, he's so unlikable, that you can't help but love him. Repunzul is charming, and the horse Maximus had me laughing at everything he did. The action scenes are fun and creative, and the ending came as a big shock, it even took one of the worst cliché's ever, and made me not care that I had seen it before.One of the things that disappointed me were the songs, only two were memorable, the rest were fine, but completely forgettable. 'When will My life Begin,' and 'Mother Knows Best,' are still trapped in my head though, I rank up there with my other favorite Disney songs like 'Under the Sea,' 'One Jump Ahead,' 'Be our Guest,' I just Can't wait to be King,' 'Savages,' and 'I'll make a man out of you.' Although I still think I like Bolt a little bit more, Tangled shows that Disney can make a great CGI movie, and I hope for more in the future.",9,0,2,13 June 2011
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Good, but worst of prequels
","This is a good movie to watch if your in the mood for a complex story, a lot of action, and great special effects, but it doesn't have as much entertainment as most of the others. The fights are good, like Dooku vs yoda, obi wan vs jango, mace windu vs jango, and anikan vs anikan. But it does have a pretty complex story that can get confusing, it a good movie, but don't try to understand the logic, your brain will explode. Episode 2 is fun, it's a nice ride that can really can make you head spin, for the most part, but the few times its boring, its really boring and almost ruins the film. But it has a good story, amazing special effects, decent acting, and interesting characters. I recommend it, even if your not a star wars fan.",7,2,5,30 March 2010
Forrest Gump," The only time I've ever agreed on Best Picture
","1994 was probably one of the best years for movies, at least from the movie's I've seen. Pretty much every movie I've seen from that year was great, and for me, the best of all those good movies was Forrest Gump. Now some people say this movie wasn't that good, and didn't deserve best picture against other movie's like Pulp Fiction and Shashank Redemption. Well I tried, I tried really hard, to nitpick this movie, find any flaw, and I found so few that they are probably barely worth mentioning.Sometimes Jenny could come off a bit unlikable, like, why does she continue to leave Forrest and come back to him, just to tease him. I've heard some people complain about the moral, saying it's OK to be stupid because eventually you'll be good at something, or something like that. Personally I see it as don't let disability's get you down, you can do anything no matter what, also God is good.This movie gives you almost everything, you want comedy it has comedy, you want action it has action, romance, drama, historical fiction, even a little bit of fantasy. As long as you aren't looking for sci-fi or horror, this movie will give you something. It looks great, the production design transport you back to the middle of the twentieth century. And the special effects are phenomenal, and the best part, they aren't noticeable. Seriously you would be surprised how much of this movie used special effects. The acting is great, Tom Hanks giving the best performance of his career, the direction is great, and the writing is fantastic. It sort of gives a history lessong while being hilarious at the same time.Forrest Gump is just one of those movie that is almost perfect, it came out in a year of great movies, and managed to be the best.",10,1,2,12 July 2011
21 Jump Street," Pretty Good
","I never saw the original TV series that this was based on, so I don't know how well of an adabtation it is. I've also never seen Channing Tatum in anything, and very little of Jonah Hill. I really wouldn't have bothered with this movie if everyone wasn't saying how great it was and quoting it all the time. So how did the movie turn out? Pretty good actually. I was a little afraid when I started it, but in the end I found myself having a good time.Cons, there are a few dry spots, and there really aren't any big laughs. There are plenty of moments where I was laughing, but never one where I could barely breath and my sides hurt, which is what a lot of people made it sound like. Also there is one really big plot hole, or lack of logic. This may be a spoiler, but I'm not sure.When they get there, the mess up there names, so they get each others schedules. Tatum was supposed to be in drama and band, Hill was in AP Chem. The only person who knows is the princibal, and he probably won't remember. Just go to the classes you were supposed to go to. They don't know who you are.Like I said, the movie is pretty funny, but I really liked the action scenes and the plot. The action was exiting, and better shot them action scenes in some actual straight up action movies. And the plot has many twists and turns. I was actually surprised by who the suplier turned out to be, and there is a really cool cameo near the ending. The acting and chemistry between Tatum and Hill is good, and it's not really ever boring.This isn't 'a gut-wretching, you won't be able to breath because your laughing too hard movie', but it is fun, and has some great moments in it.",8,0,0,9 July 2012
Captain America: The First Avenger," Surprised by how much I liked it.
","It seems Marvel saved the best for last, at least in my opinion. Captain America is my personal favorite of the five pre-Avengers movies. And I think the main reason for that is that I actually really liked the plot of this movie. The other four film's plots were fine, but this one really interested me. Maybe I just love people beating the crap out of Nazi's? Also, I really liked the characters, especially Steve Rogers. He seems kind of like me. Unlike Thor and Tony Stark, this guy isn't a douchbag half the time. He's very likable and you really root for him. And his love interest is good as well, she's a tough female lead in a the time of World War II. But my favorite was Phillips, he was just so stereotypical war colonel that it was funny. And the film has a very good sense of humor without going over the top with it. The villain was cool, and Hugo Weaving was perfect. The acting, special effects, action scenes, and production value, all done well, it looked like the 40s. And I like the way it tied into Thor and Iron Man.So what didn't I like, well near the middle we have that misunderstanding between Rogers and Carter, that's cliché enough, but then it's like they just forget about it as soon as it starts. Also there are some parts where it slows down, and I mean really slows down to where I just turned away and browsed the internet. And a lot of Captain America's team is forgettable, I thought that was his brother, but Wikipedia said it was his friend? So yeah, if you disagree that's fine, but this is my personal favorite of the pre-Avengers movies. And I'm very happy that Captain America is supposed to be the main focus of the Avengers. Or was that just a rumor?",8,2,3,26 January 2012
The Matrix Revolutions," Very Disappointed
","I Loved the first Matrix film, I held off watching it for eleven years, and when I finally watched it, it became one of my favorite movies. Matrix Reloaded I feel is a very underrated sequel, as it has does set up a plot, and the action scenes are thrilling. So I sat down to watch Matrix Revolutions, and when it ended, I felt disappointed.Matrix Reloaded set up a plot, and a conflict, so that this movie could resolve it, and while it does resolve, it doesn't get resolved very well. I know I'm not alone on this, how does that finale make any sense, I know the rumors, but those don't add up well either.There are some very good action scenes in this movie, the battle of Zion is good for a while, and Neo vs. Smith was well done, even if it got a little tedious after a while. There was a lot of stuff here to make a good movie, but it came up short. At least the Wachowski brothers made up for it with the incredible V for Vendetta.",4,0,1,22 August 2011
Lilo & Stitch," I loved this movie
","After the Disney Renissance ended in 1999, Disney began making movies that fell into a few certain categories. Good not great, great but didn't make much money, or just bad. This trend continued up to Bolt, but one of the major exeptions was Lilo and Stitch.A story of a girl named Lilo, who adobts an alien named Stitch who she thinks is a dog. But Stitch is being hunted by his creator Jumba, and AGent Plekley. Lilo also is having trouble at home, her parents died and now a social worker is threatening to take Lilo away from her older sister Nani if she can't find a job.The film works well not only as a science fiction adventure story, but as a heartwarming family drama. And unlike the emperors New Groove, it actually made money, and unlike chicken Little it didn't suck. Lilo and Stitch is a great film, and Disney's last great film until Bolt.",9,1,1,8 July 2011
The Village," Not Great, but looks great
","The Village is that one M. Night Shymalan movie that splits people right down the middle, some like it, some don't, but not many people love it or hate it. When the trailer was first released for this film, it made the movie look like some kind of supernatural thriller, and it looked really cool. Unfortunately the trailer lied to people, the movie is actually more of a romance. Sure there are a few thriller elements in there, but people went in expecting a thriller and got a romance, and were very disappointed. Personally I like this movie, but it does have some flaws.For one, this movie can get extremely boring in a few places. And I mean almost fall asleep boring. Also, most of the characters are extremely forgettable. The two leads are fine, Sigorney Weaver is a little memorable, and you got a feel a little sorry for Noah, but the rest are just forgotten once you stop watching the movie. It gets way too overly dramatic at times, and it's a little pretensious.But the film looks fantastic, can someone please explain why Shymalan is a terrible director, every single one of his films I've seen (everyone except Praying with Anger) looks great. The lighting is great, the use of color, and every shot is done well. The acting is good for the most part. And I actually really like the twists, a lot of people, even fans of the movie don't like them, but personally I thought they were pretty good. And I like how you can analyze the film. I won't spoil anything, but the last twist brings up some questions that are worthy of being analyzed.I like the Village about as much as I liked Drive, both have great things about them, but they are dragged down by being too much about the style and getting really boring at times. So if you loved Drive, you should love this movie. Personally I like it, it isn't as good as Signs or Sixth Sense, but it is better than Lady in the Water and Unbreakable (bring on the hate.)",7,1,2,1 September 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," One of the Best book to film adaptations ever
","I loved it, this is the perfect buildup to the finale, and one of the best book to film adabtations I've ever seen.I swear, some of this stuff was word for word in the book, like the scene in the tent when Harry and Ron are fighting, I think they didn't have a script, Yates just handed them the book and told them to read that. Once again, the acting, effects, and production value are all great. And the comedy is some of the best in the series. Some complain that nothing happens, well thats the point, it's all buildup, it may seem tedious, but once the you see the final film it will all be worth it.However this film does have some really stupid moments. I know that Pettigrew killing himelf may have been too graphic, but did you have to make that scene so stupid, just stupefying him would have been better. Also, where the hell are the Dursleys, THEY FILMED IT, I have the DVD, I saw the deleted scenes, they showed Harry and Dudley saying goodbye, and it was good, why did they cut it? In the end, Dudley's face is never seen and Aunt Petunia doesn't get a line. There are a few other things, but there all nitpicking.A lot of people hate it because it's boring, but I was not bored once during the whole film. It's buildup, and it will all payoff.",10,1,1,21 December 2010
Kung Fu Panda 2," On Par with the original
","This is a sequel that I can't tell is either better or worse than the original. Now I did really enjoy the first movie, it wasn't perfect, but it was fun, funny, had great animation, good voice acting, and actually had a pretty good story. This film is fun, funny, has great animation (as well as some really good 2D animation sequences, it has great animation, good voice acting, a a story that adds to the original. So what you get is a pretty damn good sequel.I still am not a big fan of Po, while he did grow on me more in this film I still felt the furious five was better. And thankfully they are in this movie a little bit more than the first one. I did laugh quite a bit, I always had a smile on my face. The animation is great, and unlike other Dreamworks films, it includes quite a bit of 2D animation in it that really looks good. The voices once again are good, Jack Black gives it his all, and the rest of the cast is good, and they let Jackie Chan have more than one line! But the story is really well done here, it adds to the first film, as we find out what happens to Po's parents. I won't spoil it, but the ending actually had me go, 'WOAH!'",8,0,1,31 January 2012
Knowing," Good Film with a horrible ending
","(This review may contain spoilers) OK, for the most Part, Knowing is an original disaster movie, with biblical themes and an interesting premise. But within the last ten minutes the film goes downhill really fast.Nick Cage has a son that goes to middle school. It happens to be the fifty year anniversary, and they dig up a time capsule from the first year of the school. Each kid gets something, and Cage's son gets a list of a bunch of numbers. Cage soon discovers that each number tells a date and location of a disaster from each year after the list was written, as well as the number of people who will die. He also notices that there are disasters left. An airplane crash, a train derailment, and a solar flare that will reach Earth and burn the planet.I really enjoyed this movie, some of the writing was bad, but the disaster scenes were cool, and it was just a cool idea, even if it wasn't executed as perfectly as I hoped. The only horrible thing about this film, the ending, I won't say, but one question, were they aliens, or angels.",7,0,2,19 August 2010
Hugo," Beautiful and Touching
","Despite the fact that I am a huge movie buff, I actually haven't seen a lot of Martin Scorsses' films. I saw Shutter Island, which was good but far from perfect, and about twenty minutes of the Departed before I realized that I didn't care, skipped to the end and then shut it off. However his newest film Hugo is not a mystery, nor is it a thriller, it's a family film, and a damn good one.If you have ever done anything creative, such as writing, painting, sculpting, and especially film, then you really should see this film. This follows the tale of a young boy named Hugo, who meets a girl who's grandfather used to be a film director. He was actually the first filmmaker to realize that movies don't have to just be moving images, they can be a way to make your dreams come alive. His most famous movie being 'A Trip to the Moon,' you know that one with the rocket crashed into the moon that for some reason has a face. The film has a very well told story that is touching, funny, and even quite sad at times. And it is also beautiful, the cinematography is absolutely amazing and the lighting and special effects are very well handled.Hugo is not a kids movie, it is a family film. There are no stupid jokes that cater to the lowest common denominator. The only real problem I had with the film was that at times it could get a little boring, but that doesn't stop the fact that this is a great film both technically and story wise.",9,4,7,21 February 2012
Wanted," I Hate Wanted
","Let me just get this straight out of the way, I F**KING HATED This MOVIE!!! And you know, it's not like I knew I was going to hate it, when I first saw the trailers for this movie back in early 2008, I was hyped up, I thought the whole, curving bullets thing looked awesome. I didn't get to see it in theaters because I was 15, my mom wouldn't take me, and my dad hates Angelina Jolie, so it slipped from my mind. Then around mid 2010, I was browsing a pawn shop, and found a copy of the film for 5 dollars, so I bought it.Why do I hate this movie, well, I think the biggest problem has to be the premise. Just the fact that these people kill because a magical loom is telling them to through binary code. What proof do they have that this loom is magic, besides an old tale? Well, it turns out Fox's parents were killed because a man that shot them wasn't taken out by a member of the fraternity. Not only is this idea stupid, its a rip-off of Minority Report. In that film, three psychics called preclogs, tell when a murder is going to happen before it happens, then precrime stops them and throws them into a vegetable state. I'm sorry, but this whole magic loom idea doesn't make any sense, if it tells the murder of any human on the planet, then it would never stop, if its only Chicago, then, was this loom really found in Chicago, does it just adapt to it's surroundings.Forget the plot, how about the fact that the acting is awful. Morgan Freeman is the only one to give a descent job, everyone else is just bland. The characters are annoying, especially Wesley, he takes wimp to a whole another level. I'm a wimp, and I probably would be the s**t out of this guy if I ever saw him, he's that annoying. He's basically what would happen if you put Shia LaBeouf and Micheal Cera together and took out all likability.Oh, and another thing, this movie stretches the suspension of disbelief around the freaking earth before it finally just breaks. I called bulls**t so many times, from surviving a fall into a river 100 feet and not breaking any bones. To this newcomer taking down the entire fraternity in just a couple minutes. And shooting a bullet, all the way across town, through a donut, coffee, and finally through Morgan Freeman. And you know, I could handle all that, I mean, I love 2012, I love Cloverfield, I like a lot of action and disaster movies that you need to suspend your disbelief to enjoy, but there's one problem, this movie is BORING!!!The first time I tried watching this, I fell asleep half way thorough, and the second time I actually had to fight to stay awake. The action in this movie isn't very interesting, first of all it looks like its ripping off the Matrix, but the editing is a mess. It's always, jump cutting, it nearly gave me a headache. The only enjoyable parts of this movie were Morgan Freeman, and the train derailment. Oh, and the plot holes.I normally don't mind plot holes, I mean, one of my favorite Steven Spielberg movies is War of the Worlds, and that had a lot of plot holes, but here are a few reasons I forgave the plot holes in WOTW, and not in Wanted.1. Likable characters 2. Awesome Action 3. Great Special Effects (Seriously the CG bullets in Wanted look like S**t) 4. Actual Suspense 5. Entertainment ValueEven WOTW had an annoying character (Racheal) who I could forgive because I was having fun, I don't have fun with Wanted. Not only does this movie suck, but it's unbelievably overrated. The film currently has a 72% on Rotten Tomatoes and a 6.9 on IMDb. This currently stands as the second most overrated film I have ever seen after The Hurt Locker, but The Hurt Locker is a much better film. Don't misunderstand me, if you like the movie, that's great, I'm happy for you, but personally, I can't stand it. And I've never read the comic, so I'm not upset that they didn't follow the source material. The film was just a mess, full of plot holes, annoying characters, boring action, and tons of bulls**t. The only reason it doesn't get a 1 is because it isn't the worst movie I've ever seen, and thus it automatically gets a two, Damn you Uwe Boll.",2,1,4,11 September 2011
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Awesome sequel to awesome movie
","The original Terminator was a masterpiece, and a great example on how to make a great action movie with great special effects without a big budget. So when you make a sequel and get a much bigger budget, you can either make it bigger and better than the original, or bigger and not nearly as good as the original. Thankfully Terminator two is actually better, or at least just as good, but more entertaining than it's predecessor.Of course near the end we get the big plot hole with if they do mangage to stop the machine uprising, than John would never be born, and then a huge paradox would happen. Also John is a bit of an a##hole in the beginning, but he redeems himself. There are other problems of course but it's mostly nitpicking.The action scenes are fantastic, with some of the best practical and CGI effects ever. The pacing is perfect, that was one of the problems the first movie had, it was too slow at points, but this movie give you an action scene in just the right place so you don't become bored, nor does it seem like it's just a mindless action movie. The character's are likable, and at times actually pretty funny. And it does bring up good questions about weather you would kill one innocent man if that meant saving millions of other innocent lives.There are of course other good things in the movie, but I won't spoil anything, if you haven't seen the movie, just go watch it.",10,4,5,31 March 2010
Disturbia," A great Horror Flick
","First let me just say this, I haven't seen 'Rear Window.' I actually haven't seen any Alfred Hitchcock movies yet, but I will. I bring this up because this movie is basically a remake of 'Rear Window.' It has the same basic premise just brought into the 21st century. And I'm surprised this movie actually got pretty good reviews. Remaking a classic starring the kid from Transformers, sounds like it should have been hated. I really liked this movie, I would say it's probably my favorite PG-13 horror film and one of the best thrillers of the last decade.For the negative side, it does take a while to get going, the main villain doesn't appear until about 30 minutes in. I don't like the subplot involving the neighborhood kids who torment Kale. When people are fighting the camera begins to get all shaky. And near the end it gets way, way too dark, I can't tell what is going on even when I watch it in pictch darkness.Now Shia LaBeouf seems to be an actor who gets a lot of hate. Personally I really like him though, he's a good actor and is pretty likable. Sam Witwicky would have been a completely unbearable character had Shia not brought any likability to him. And this movie is his best film in my opinion. I like all the characters, Ronnie is really funny at times, his mom is Kary Ann Mosse, aka Trinity who is always awesome. I really like the atmosphere, the direction make the suspense high with the camera shots, music and lighting. There are some pretty good jump scares, and it does a good job of making you feel trapped in the house with Kale.Disturbia is a great example of how to do PG-13 horror. It doesn't have much blood, or swearing. It just has atmosphere and suspense, with a few jump scares thrown in.",8,4,7,6 May 2010
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Great, but not my favorite as it is for most
","Plot: After blowing up his aunt Marge, Harry returns back to Hogwarts to find that mass murderer Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban. Soul sucking beings called dementors are placed all around the school. At first trying to stay away from Sirius as much as possible, Harry soon learns that it was Sirius that sold out his parents location and led to their deaths. Review: Of all the Harry Potter movies, this one is often considered the favorite among most of the viewers. And while I love it, and say it is a rather good adaptation, I still find this to be one of the weaker films in the series. To me, it relies so much on looking nice.Now as a film, this could be the best of all of them, the lighting, direction, acting, and overall production value are amazing. But as an adaptation it falls short, such as the fact that it doesn't explain who the marauders are, and it never explained that Harry dad could turn into a Stag, so when Harry said his dad saved him, it didn't make any sense. So overall it's the best adabtaion we would get for a few more movies, but it needed to explain the back story a little more.This is the first film in the series to get a new director after Columbus, taking over is Alfanso Curon, who definitely knows how to make a film. His style is obvious as the whole way the film looks is definitely darker than the other two. The whole movie is darker as well, with Harry nearly escaping death several times, and finally learning more about how his parents died. This is also the only film in which Voldemort doesn't appear at all. And the first film in which Micheal Gambon plays Dumbledore, replacing the late Richard Harris. A lot of fans hate Gambon as Dumbledore, saying he is too mean and doesn't look the part, but I think he does a pretty good job, just no where near as good as Richard Harris. Granted his beard looked off, but he definitely acted just as quirky as Dumbledore should have.Overall, as a film it's absolutely fantastic, and even as an adaption, it's still pretty good, but it isn't my favorite in the series as others say.",9,1,2,8 July 2011
The Amazing Spider-Man," Not Amazing, but pretty damn Good.
","Here's a little confession, I have not seen the Sam Raimi Spiderman movies. Nor have I read any of the comics, or really watched any form of media about him, I think I saw a few episodes of the old cartoon once, but that's about it. So unlike everyone else, I didn't go into this movie with ridicuously high expectations. And for me, this movie actually exceeded my expectations. I just wanted a fun movie, but this movie was actually a very well done, pretty emotional movie that still managed to be fun.There's quite a bit going on here, and because of this the film seems to forget about some of it's plot points. Maybe they were setting up for a sequel, but can we really just forget about some of these things that I won't spoil. And also because there is so much going on, sometimes it will either be going painfully slow, or feels rushed. I mean seriously it takes like 20 seconds after the bite and Peter already knows he has powers, but it takes almost a half hour after that for him to actually become Spider Man. Also some of the special effects weren't that great.But what I really liked was the characters in this movie. I actually really liked Peter, he came off as a real person. He was nice but was sarcastic, he was picked on, but he wasn't a nerd, he gets dramatic about the stuff going on in his life, but he has a sense of humor. There's a bit of an emotional pull to the movie involving his relationship with the other characters. Gwen was likable, she was what a good female lead should be: tough, smart, likable, funny, but even she can get into trouble. Half the time I forgot Emma Stone was playing her. And the villain was threatening, but kind of sympathetic. Despite some of the effects looking fake, most of them look pretty damn amazing. And it's just fun, that's one thing Marvel has over DC most of the time, they have a sense of fun to them. The movie is serious, but it's also a little campy, I mean there's only so serious that you can take a man dressed in that suit. It has a real fun sense of humor (including one of, if not the best Stan Lee Cameos), along with some fun action scenes. And as for the story, it's pretty basic, but it works.The Amazing Spider Man is definitely one of the better superhero orgin stories I've seen. Certainly more fun than Batman Begins and Iron Man. Despite some slow scenes, and some rushed scenes, the film manages to balance the seriousness of trying to make a superhero orgin story, and the fun that a comicbook movie like this should have. And while some people were disappointed, my expectaitons were actually surpassed.",8,3,6,27 October 2012
The Lego Movie," The best comedy of the Year
","So I had heard that The Lego Movie was really, really good, and yeah, it really was. There was so much to like in this movie, it was funny, creative, dramatic at points, fast paced, entertaining, and has a really good moral. There are cameos from some of our favorite characters that I won't dare spoil for anyone. And did I mention that it was funny, because it is, it's really, really funny. This is my kind of humor, fast paced with a lot of sarcastic moments that border on anti-humor. The characters, not just the copyrighted ones, are likable, entertaining and feel developed. This is a movie that can be enjoyed by the entire family, in fact there were only a couple of things I found wrong with the film at all.One involved it's pacing, which is incredibly fast. For the most part it works and it does know to slow down once in a while, however sometimes a scene that should have been dramatic or slow paced goes by so fast or has so many jokes or jokes at the wrong moment that it ruins the drama. Then there is the ending, which while funny and very heartwarming seemed really confusing and brought up a lot of questions.Yet this film is a blast from start to finish and I hope they make a sequel.",9,0,2,2 June 2014
Die Hard 2," Incredibly Flawed, but Incredibly Fun
","I had never noticed that Die Hard 2 got quite a bit of hate. I mean most people seem to like it, but ask most people and they will say that it's the weakest of the four. And I'd be lying if I said I didn't see why. In comparing the four this one probably is the most flawed, but in my opinion, it's also one of the most fun.This has one of the most contrived plots you will ever see in a movie. The terrorists threaten to keep the planes in the air until they run out of fuel, OK, good plan, but why don't the planes just go to another airport. I mean we heard a couple had closed down due to weather, but there are more than two other airports in DC. So why don't they tell them as soon as they are able to halfway through the movie. There are other plot holes in this movie, but it's an action movie. The villain's a little weird, he's literally introduced doing yoga completely naked, and throughout the first half he seems to be trying way to hard to be evil. And in the end he isn't as memorable as other villains in the series.But this movie is just a lot of fun to watch, I mean the first films better overall, but I'd say the last 45 minutes of this film are more fun than most of the action in the first. Bruce Willis is of course just as awesome as he was in the first film. I loved the supporting characters, it seems that most of them were able to get at least one laugh. There's plenty of cool explosions, and fantastic effects. Plus the plot, if you can get past all the holes, is pretty interesting, with a few fun twists.Die Hard 2: Die Harder (a title so bad it has to be good) is probably the most flawed of all four movies so far, but it's just too much fun to care.",8,0,2,11 December 2012
Independence Day," Roland Emmerich at his best
","Now before you criticize me for giving this movie a perfect grade let me make this clear, this is not a perfect movie. In no way could I consider this movie to be a masterpiece. It is just a masterpiece of pure popcorn entertainment.Yes it's longer than it should be. Yes it's incredibly stupid with the whole computer virus thing. Yes it stretches the suspension of disbelieve way, way too far. And yes it isn't the most well written movie in the world.But the special effects are fantastic, with a nice mix of practical and CGI so that everyone is happy. The acting is actually pretty good for the most part. Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum bring likablity to their characters. Speaking of characters, all of them are likable and get a good amount of screen time so we care about them. This is a big film, with a huge ensemble cast and many plot lines that all come together, and I love stuff like that.The film never takes itself too seriously, having a patriotic theme that's so cheesy but awesome at the same time. The action is fantastic and it just a plain fun movie.ID4 isn't the most well written movie in the world but boy is it a lot of fun.",10,2,6,29 March 2010
District 9," Fun, entertaining, though not perfect
","This is another movie that didn't quite live up to the hype, but that's not saying much.First thing, the good stuff: It is so nicely made, the cinematography is perfect. The aliens are like E.T., hideous, but also cute, you want them to get back home. It mixes steady and shaky cam. The plot is, for the most part, original. And it's just so entertaining, mixing drama and comedy.Next, the bad stuff, really, the bad stuff happens in the last act of the movie. Our main character, who we want to succeed suddenlly turns into a murderer. Brutally killing innocent soilders up when he could have easily have pushed them out of the way. And the ending wasn't exactly the happiest ending was it. Other than that, it's perfect, a wonderful, entertaining movie.",8,0,4,27 March 2010
Batman Begins," It isn't bad, just not that Entertaining
","This is one of the few movies in which I actually watched the sequel first. Maybe that is why I didn't enjoy this movie as much as the critics and audiences who praised it to no end. While The Dark Knight wasn't perfect, it goes down as one of the best sequels of all time, mostly because the film it is following, was incredibly overrated.I may have mentioned before that I am not a big fan of superhero orgin stories. To me, they have way too much talking and exposition, and the sequels would handle the action, and thus be more entertaining. Now I know that they need to set up why Bruce Wayne became Batman, but do we really need to spend half the movie. I swear 20 percent of the movie is flashbacks. And when action does happen, it's horrendous. The action scenes in this movie are shot so poorly, and edited so sloppily, I can not tell what's going on. Christopeher Nolan is a fantastic director, so why did he choose to shoot the action scenes this way? So sense most of the movie is exposition, and the action scenes are terribly shot, the movie just isn't very interesting.Now, I'm not saying this is a bad movie, for all it's faults, it does do some things extremely well. I did like Bruce's backstory, and found him becoming Batman to be kind of interesting. If it didn't take up 50 percent of the movie, I wouldn't complain too much. I really like some of the characters: Alfred, Gordon, and Dr. Crane. I thought Scarecrow was a much more interesting villain than Ra's al Ghul. The film looks amazing, the acting is good, and there are a few funny lines.Batman Begins isn't a bad movie, it's just not particuarlly entertaining. The action scenes are horrible, and the set up goes on for too long. I admit it doesn't feel too long, and I really like the ending with the setup for a sequel. And I can see why the film is loved by so many people. When it first came out the last Batman movie we got was Batman and Robin.The movie was OK, it was descent. Not one I will watch over and over again, but far from a terrible movie.",6,1,1,14 March 2010
Wreck-It Ralph," The Best Animated Movie of the Year
","Ever since John Lasseter took over as the head of Dinsey's animation department, their CGI films have gotten a lot better. I'd actually consider Bolt and Tangled up there with some of Disney's Best works. And the same goes for Wreck It-Ralph, this is a funny, very exiting and likable movie that it should please everyone, not just gamers, and not just animation fans.Probably my biggest complaint isn't so much a problem in the movie, it's just a little disappointment as to what it was marketed as. I though Ralph would be going into a lot more games and meet many more classic game characters, but he really only goes into four, one only for a short gag, and the cameos only really appear in the first act. Most of the rest is nitpicking, some of the jokes aren't that funny, the romance between felix and the commander feels a bit forced, and the rest are just so small.I laughed quite a bit in this movie, going from small chuckles to LOLing. I loved the characters in this movie, the heros were likable and interesting, with some great backstory's and a few good twists along the way for some of them. The villain is funny and has quite the motivation, he is also very good at lying. The animation is fantastic, it seems to change with each game which is appropriate. The action scenes are fun, and the plot is deep without getting confusing. The cameos never take away from the story, and even though I'm not a gamer, I can tell you I enjoyed a lot of these cameos, so if you are a hardcore gamer, you will probably love this movie.Wreck it Ralph ranks up with some of Disney's best works, and it the best animated movie of the year. It's funny, exiting, has some good dramatic moments, has a great pacing, fun characters, and fantastic animation. There are some nitpicks I have, but that doesn't stop this from being a great movie.",9,3,4,3 December 2012
Bridesmaids," Three Things Save this Movie
","This movie isn't quite as overrated as Paul was, despite the fact that it got even better reviews. This movie has three things that saved it. 1. The way it made me actually care about Kristen Wigg's friendship with the bride. 2. The bridal shower scene. And 3. the most important one, the fat chick, Meghan, played by Melissa McCarthy. Good Lord was that chick hilarious. The scene where she just went screw it and began crapping in a sink almost had me in tears. Every time she was on screen, I had a smile on my face. I wish the same could be said for the rest of the film. This movie has very unfunny scenes, the stuff on the plane wasn't funny, the scene where Kristen Wigg and Rose Byrne are trying to get attention from the cop wasn't that funny (exept when the car rolled by and no one was seen in the car), and that scene where Kristen and Rose are trying to give the better speech, Oh my God, shut UP!!! That's another problem, this movie is way, way too long, this movie is about 2 hours and 5 minutes long, that's already pretty long for a comedy, but for me, it felt like five hours. Seriously, if a movie is 2 hours long and it fells like 5, something has gone horribly wrong.5/10",5,0,2,4 January 2012
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Has some great things, but it is REALLY long
","The Lord of the Rings trilogy is one of the most outstanding achievements in filmmaking history. They have a great story, great characters, great effects and just a great feel to them. Of course I have only seen them once. I just can't really find the time to watch them, they are so long and I feel obligated to watch them all in one sitting. Now we have the Hobbit, which is a prequel, based on one book and yet it's just as long as the other films. Does it deserve to be that long? No, the answer is no, there is no reason this movie needs to be three hours long. It's three hours long and it feels like it, the pacing in the first half of the movie is so off that I almost wanted to stop watching it. Also it seems this movie is playing it a little too comedically, I know the other movies had comedy, but it seems half the diologue had a punchline. A lot of the characters are just sort of forgettable, and did I mention that it is long? Technical wise though this film is amazing, the visuals, the cinematography, the action, all of these were outstanding. The acting is really good, especially the guy who played young Bilbo, man, he looked exactly what you would expect a young Bilbo to look like when you see old Bilbo. It's nice to see some old faces again such as Sauromon, Frodo, and Hugo Weaving (can't remember his name.) And the second half definitely picks up the pacing a bit.The Hobbit is overly long, and the first half has some unbelievably slow pacing. But the stuff they get right, they get really right.",7,0,3,9 February 2013
Saving Private Ryan," My favorite War Movie
","Now that really doesn't mean much, as of now I have only seen four REAL war movies, Inglorious Besterds, Shindler's List, Hurt Locker, and this. And of those four, the only two that involve combat in the field are Hurt Locker and this, and I hated Hurt Locker. That being said, I still loved this movie.For one it was shot perfectly, the scenes that don't involve fighting are nice and still, and the scenes that have fighting have just a little shaky cam, not too much to make me angry and dizzy. Tom Hanks and Matt Damon are great, as well as the rest of the cast. THe production value is very hight, every explosion is great, and most importanly, I was never bored.Every thing kept my interest, the fighting, the struggles of the crew, by the end, I actually wished it had been a little longer, and that is the sign of a very good flick.",9,1,2,12 August 2011
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," The Best in the Francise
","Granted I haven't seen the second one, but from what I hear that's the weakest of the series. Now I did enjoy the first Mission Impossible, it was a little confusing but still pretty fun. The third was better, making the plot simple but not meant for babies. However the fourth movie, Ghost Protocol was extremely well done.The action scenes were really well done, especially the scene where Tom Cruise was scaling the building, damn to I wish I saw that in Imax. The acting was great, and it didn't take itself to seriously, I laughed quite a bit in the theater.And there are several twists and turns that keep your mind working, this isn't a movie for little kids. There really isn't much else to say. Brad Bird, you have made the transition from animation to live action perfectly.",9,13,23,31 January 2012
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," A guilty pleasure
","Is The Lost World: Jurassic Park technically a good movie? Well not really. As a film on it's own, it's OK, it has plenty of forgettable characters, plot holes in a few places and some comedy that really falls flat. As a sequel, it's mediocre, with a few inconsistencies here and there. And as an adaptation, it is absolutely terrible. I won't get into a long rant about how much they changed, but if you have read the book, then you will have almost no idea that the movie was supposed to be an adaptation.So why do I enjoy this movie. Well the action scenes are thrilling. The trailer scene alone makes this movie worth watching, but the T-Rex in San Diego is also pretty cool. Ian Malcolm is pretty hilarious and I like Tempo. And while the special effects aren't as mind blowing as they were in the first film they are still very good and a nice mix of practical and CGI.While not a very good movie, The Lost World is a pretty fun movie. It's a guilty pleasure, it sure isn't as good as the original, but I don't think it's nearly as bad as some people say.",7,0,1,11 May 2010
Cars," Pixar's Weakest Film to date
","I have seen all but one Pixar film, and that's Cars 2. What I love about Pixar is that they don't make kids movies, they make movies that both kids and adults can enjoy. The Toy Story trilogy is my favorite trilogy, the Incredibles is my favorite Super hero movie, and Wall-e ranks up with some science fiction classics in my opinion. However their 2006 film Cars, doesn't match up well with their other films. The second weakest Pixar film in my opinion is A Bug's Life, which is still a really good film. Overall, Cars isn't really a bad film, it's just OK.The film does have really great animation, as all Pixar films do, the acting's good, there are some really good characters, and I like how the final race didn't go for a cliché route. However the story is completely trite, we all know how this story is going to unfold. Also I'm not a big fan of Mater, I have nothing against Larry the Cable Guy, but Mater brings the film down a bit for me. That's why I'm scared to see Cars 2. Some of the jokes are good, but then you have some toilet humor that just doesn't work well.Cars is OK, but for a Pixar film, and one directed by John Lassater, it defiantly won't be on my DVD shelf any time soon.",6,2,4,11 January 2012
Drive," A good, but incredibly over-rated film
","Plot: Ryan Gosling plays a nameless stunt car driver who leads a double life as a getaway driver. After meeting a woman named Irene, and her son Benicio, he begins to grow a bond for them. When Irene's husband is released from prison, Gosling must help him get money in order to pay off his debt to the mafia. Review: I wanted to LOVE this movie, I had heard nothing, and I mean nothing but good things about this movie. And of all the reviews I've read and watched, 95% of them said the movie was a masterpiece, not just good, but a phenomenal film. It has a 93% on Rotten Tomatoes, and a 8.1 on IMDb (Number 204 on IMDb's top 100.) So when I was done watching it, I couldn't help but feel a little disappointed.Really my big problem was that I really didn't care for Ryan Gosling's character, at least near the beginning. I think the only reason I actually cared about weather he died or not was because he was helping out this family (which we will get to later). This movie is about an hour and a half, and the first half hour of this film is extremely boring. The first car chase wasn't that impressive because they really hadn't established anything except that we were watching robbers, so why should we be rooting for them? A lot of the characters I completely forgot were in the film, like the bald guy, seems he was the guy in both the strip club, and the diner when he, well, if you've seen the movie you know what happens to him. At times the movie seems kind of pretentious, like their trying way to hard to make it artsy. I swear there were several points in the movie where I though I paused the film, it seems the director told the actors to just not move a muscle for no reason. And for a movie called Drive their aren't many driving scenes.Now let's get onto the good stuff, I LOVED, the family, I really cared about them, I thought I would hate the father who just got out of prison, but when we find out that he is basically being screwed by the mafia, I felt sorry for him. And Irene and Benicio are so likable that they make up for the main character's flaws. The acting is great, I wouldn't mind if this film won some acting awards. Despite some scenes being about nothing the direction and cinematography were great, no shaky cam. The two driving scenes that aren't the first one are pretty entertaining, and I actually gasped a few times. People die in this movie, and I actually felt kind of sad for them. And the gore effects are great, the elevator scene will make any gore hungry nut very happy. And the villains were pretty cool too, not amazing, but I was waiting for them to die.Overall Drive is not an outstanding movie, at least not to me. Richard Roeper and Peter Travers named it the best movie of 2011. While it may be one of the better films I've seen, it didn't even make it into my top 10 favorites. I had more fun with Transformers, Final Destination and Rio, even if they are worse films. Drive is a good film, I did like it, but I didn't love it and I hope that everyone will respect my opinion.",7,0,3,9 January 2012
Insidious," It's No Paranormal Activity, but it's still pretty darn scary
","Best horror movie of the year, that I've seen. Insidious is and example of how a PG-13 horror film can work. It isn't a bloodbath, and doesn't constantly throw false jump scares on you.This film actually builds suspense and then hits you with something truly terrifying. Much like the Paranormal Activity Franchise. There were two really good jump scares in this film that made me scream. One of them I even saw coming, that is how good this movie is.And the ending actually creeped me out. I wanna know what happens to these people, please fan fiction save me.8/10",8,1,1,4 January 2012
Bolt," A lot of Fun
","Bolt isn't the greatest movie in Disney's animated Library, but I can say that it's in my top 20, maybe in my top 10.The plot is standard. A dog is led to believe that the life he lives on his TV show is real, but once he escapes into the real world, he becomes like a fish out of water. He doesn't understand how the real world works, he doesn't know why he doesn't have his powers, and he is in desperate need to find his owner Penny. Along the way he teams up with an alley cat named Mittens, and a hampster Rhino who also happens to be Bolt's number one fan. Back at the studio, the producer is trying to find a replacement for Bolt, but Penny still believes he's alive and will make his way back.It's trite, but it's fun. It has some great animation, fun action scenes, and some very funny moments.",8,1,3,21 December 2010
2012," One of the greatest disaster movies ever.
","Well, here we are, we are finally in the year 2012, 12 months from now we will all be dead. Nah, just kidding, we all know that that won't happen, but if there is one good thing that has come from this whole 2012 doomsday phenomenon, it would be the 2009 Roland Emmerich film 2012.Let me just get this out of the way, I absolutely love this movie. Roland Emmerich is the kind of director that you either love or hate, all his movies are high-budget, special effect driven disaster films, and 2012 is no different. I went to see this movie opening day, expecting a film of action and special effects, and thats exactly what I got. I can't say its Emmerich's best movie, it's not as good a ID4, but it's definitely his 2nd best. Let's just get this out of the way, if you want a movie driven by a good story and good characters, then you may want to find something else. This movie is all about the special effects, and they are amazing. The destruction of LA had my heart racing at three times it's usual speed. Seeing this movie in theaters was the best theater experience I have ever had, sure I've seen better movies in theaters, and I've had crazier audiences, but this film just screams theater viewing. If you first saw this film on a small screen, I pity you. Don't get me wrong I still love the film, own it on blu ray, and still find it entertaining, but nothing compares to the first theater viewing.Now sure this movie is dumb, really, really dumb, but that's one of the things I like about it, I hated science class, so forget science, just make me laugh. Maybe I'm in a minority, bu I actually liked these characters, interesting story, the third time I watched this movie, I actually cried near the end, I don't know how that works.Sure the movie is a little too long, and in the last 20-30 minutes it begins to outstay it's welcome. But if you just want to be entertained, then find this movie on blu ray, watch it on the biggest TV you can find, watch it at night, turn the lights off, as well as your brain, and just enjoy it.",9,1,5,14 February 2010
The Incredibles," Pretty much my favorite Super Hero movie
","Superhero movies are pretty much the most hyped up movies on the planet. Everyone went crazy for Captain America, Thor, Xmen, and Green Lantern this summmer, and they are already hyping up Dark Knight Rises, Amazing Spiderman, and The Avengers for next summer. Yet despite all of this, my favorite superhero movie still has to be the Incredibles, the animated film by Pixar.I think the reason I like this movie so much is because it's very original. It kind of feels like a parody of a superhero movie, while also being a superhero movie. I have never seen a superhero movie in which the superheros were forced to stop fighting, maybe it was done before, I just never saw it. The animation is steller, this is the first Pixar movie in which humans are the main characters, and man they look a lot better than the humans in Toy Story. There are no stupid jokes, almost everything is funny.The only bad thing I can say is that it's a little predictable, just a little bit.",9,0,0,19 August 2011
The Mist," Had potential that was ruined by a horrible ending
","I really wanted to love this movie, the premise to me, seemed awesome, it feels like a movie that I would come up with. I thought the first 2/3 of the movie were OK, nothing great, but they kept my attention, I cared about the characters, and it did freak me out. But then about the time they get back from the pharmacy, it goes downhill. The whole, religion is evil aspect of the film went from annoying to completely unconfortable. Every time that woman was on screen I wanted to hit something. And the fact that these people would actually go out into the mist, knowing what's out there, just seemed incredibly stupid. And then, there's the ending, I won't spoil it, but lets just say it makes all of Unbreakable look like the Care Bears movie. Seriously that ending put me in so much rage that I actually considered destroying the DVD, and had it not been from Netflix, I may have. That has to be the second worst ending to a film I have ever seen, right behind Knowing. But with Knowing, in my opinion was a really great film except for that ending, and the rest of the the really horrible stuff is only in the last 5-10 minutes, not the last third of the movie.",4,1,4,22 August 2011
Kick-Ass," Didn't Kick as much Ass as I wanted
","I have heard so many great things about this movie. About how it's one of the most original, funny, entertaining, vulgar comic book films ever. And I agree that it was unique, humorous, not boring, and was definitely vulgar. I couldn't help but feel a little disappointed with the final product when I finally sat down and watched it, but that doesn't mean it's bad.I liked the main character, I liked the fact that he wasn't a jock, a science nerd, or a rich kid, he's just a normal, average guy. I loved Hit-Girl and Big Daddy, they kicked so much ass I wanted to see so much more of them.But for the most part, the movie doesn't really focus that much on the characters and more or less focuses on the action, which is fine. Really, there's not much I can complain about in this movie, it was fun, unique, creative, and funny, but I just don't see why it's so popular.",7,1,4,18 February 2011
Unknown," Pretty Good, but not much re-watch value
","Not many people seem to remember this movie, it came out in Feburary and got pretty mixed reviews, but I found the movie to be really enjoyable. Unknown is this year's Inception, not saying that this was as good as Inception, but it's just so confusing. I had no idea how this movie was going to turn out, a sign that the movie had done something really well. And by the time it was over everything began to make sense.It's a mystery, a good mystery. However that's also the films major problem, it doesn't have much re-watch value. Sure Liam Neeson is good, and there are a few cool action scenes, but watching it a second time won't be as fun as the first time. I enjoyed it more than Taken, but I don't plan on watching it again.7.5/10",8,0,2,4 January 2012
Ghostbusters," One of the best comedys ever made
","If there was one movie that perfectly mixes comedy and horror it would be Ghostbusters. It not only is one of the funniest movie I have ever seen, but when I was just a little kid, I was actually scared to watch it.If there are any problems they are small. Some of the effects haven't aged well, and there are a few jokes that don't work.But this movie is hilarious. Bill Murray, Harold Ramis, Dan Akroyd and Ernie Hudson are all perfect comedians. Put them together and you get comedy gold. Murray plays Venkman, a sarcastic wise ass. Ramis plays Egon, the intellectual one. Akroyd plays Ray, the guy who gets exited about everything. Hudson plays Winston, the cool guy who always knows the smart thing to do. And in terms of Rick Moranis as Louis Tully, just brilliant, and actresses Sigorney Weaver and Annie Potts are also good. It's also quite terryfying, the library ghost always made me afraid to look, and stay puft always made me leave the room when I was little.If you haven't seen this movie, go watch it now.",10,8,13,12 May 2010
The Hurt Locker," Overrated
","Everyone loved the Hurt Locker didn't they, it was just so perfect they all said. Well I think differently, personally I found this movie to be extremely over rated. There are definitely some things that worked in this movie, but there are also a lot of things that don't. This movie won best picture, and I'm sorry to say, did not deserve it, there were far better movie that came out in 2009.One of my big problems in this movie is that I just don't like the main character. William James is just a douchbag, now I like Jeremy Renner, he's shown that he can be a very likable person, but half the time in this movie he is acting like an a$$hole, and most of the times they try to make him look good he comes of as moronic. I am not an expert on combat, but I bet everything that this guy would have been either killed or discharged. Another thing is the camera, it seems it wants to be like a documentary, but it isn't. Most of the movie I could just ignore it, but during the action scenes the camera shook so much and the editing was so bad I couldn't tell what was going on. I'm pretty sure half the stuff in this movie is not how it really works over in Iraq, and that explosion in the beginning? Come on, there is no way he could've been that close, he got a huge head start. And also this movie is boring. I swear a quarter of this movie is just them walking. I guess their trying to build suspense but it didn't work for me, I was bored throughout most of it. Oh, and the whole 'War is a drug' thing doesn't come in until the last five minutes.I did like Eldridge and Sanborn though, they were actually funny, likable, and relatable. This movie did win Oscars for sound mixing and sound editing, and I have to agree on that. And it has amazing production value, since they really did shoot it in the middle east. There are a couple of instances of actual suspense, the acting is great, and there are a few good explosions. So overall the direction was good, but weather Kathryn Biggelow deserved the Oscar for best director is debatable.The Hurt Locker at it's best is OK, but certainly not deserving of it's best Picture win. The main character was unlikable, the camera-work sucked during the action scenes, there seems to be some continuity errors and just errors in logic, and worst of all, it's boring. If you love the movie good for you, but I'm just going to be hoping that Zero Dark Thirty is better.",4,4,9,19 July 2010
Back to the Future Part III," Definitely the worst of the series, but still very good
","The first two Back to the Future movies are two of my favorite movies of all time. And I would consider the first film one of the most perfect movies ever made. But when I saw that the third one was going to be a western, my expectations went down a little bit. There's not really anything wrong with that, I'm just not a big fan of westerns, but I will say, this film is very, very good.One thing that has always bothered me, and this may be a spoiler, but Marty decides to go back to 1885 to save Doc because they find out he will be shot. But the 1955 Doc also knows, so why doesn't Marty just say to land the Delorean in a different spot, or why would Doc want to stay if he knows he will get shot. Also when you get down to it, the plot is just a rehash of the first movie, which I guess makes since for a film called Back to the Future, but still. And it suffers from the three curse of having the second one be so epic, but then this one is just a much smaller story.But Doc and Marty are still a lot of fun. I actually don't mind the character of Clara, she's funny, she's charming, and her scenes with Doc are actually kind of sweet. I love that we get a new villain, and he can actually kill some people. There's a lot of subtle and not so subtle references to the other movies. But the best part about this movie is the ending, the scene with the train has me on the edge of my seat every time I watch it.This movie is, good. It doesn't quite live up to the first two in my opinion, but it's still a lot of fun, and a fitting closure to the trilogy.",7,0,3,1 April 2010
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Way better than the first, but still not very good.
","I really don't see why so many people seem to think that this movie is worse than the first one. The first one was sooooo boring. Nothing happened, the characters were bland, and it was way to dramatic. Now personally, I don't care if vampires sparkle or don't eat humans, I really don't care, but couldn't you give them personality.Unfortunatlly they don't give the characters much more personality in this film, but I can definitely say I liked it more. Maybe it was because I watched the first two back to back and it was just coming off on how boring the first one was, but I have to admit, I didn't hate this film. Is it good, no, but it's passable.There's actually some fighting, it lightens up a little bit, and there is actually some conflict. I like the three leads in other roles they played, but they just need better direction.Overall, not recommended, but if you had a choice between the first two, pick this one, at the very least you'll have fun mocking it.",6,3,8,16 December 2010
Transformers," The start of a good franchise
","I consider the Transformers movie series to be one of the greatest action franchises of all time. These two movies are so entertaining I can watch them without being board. Along with the Terminator series, and Batman movies, they aren't meant to be taken seriously, just as entertainment. Although I like them both, I think the first was a little better, after all, it had to establish what happens in the rest of the series. This movie has all the action, effects, and hot celebrities you could ask for, and I can't wait to see what else Bay has planned. Transformers is a good action movie, and as long as you aren't expecting a big plot, you won't be disappointed.",7,0,3,16 March 2010
Lincoln," Great Movie
","Earlier this year, a film was released directed by Timur Bekmambetov called Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter. And it was a boring, cheap looking film that took itself way too seriously. Now Steven Spielberg has released his movie based on the greatest president in the history of the United States (in my opinion). And do I even have to tell you it's a lot better. But what surprises me is that not only is this film better, but it actually has more humorous moments than Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter. Yes, the drama about Lincoln actually has more humor than the movie called Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, how is that possible? OK enough about comparing it to that film, there are a few things that didn't work in this film. For one it takes a while to really get going, the first twenty-five minutes or so can drag a bit, yeah I know it's meant to establish the characters and start the story, but I really didn't get invested until around the twenty-five minute mark when it started. And there are so many characters in this movie that I forgot some of their names, I remembered their faces, but sometimes it could get confusing, especially since I'm not a historian, or even that into history. I only know some stuff, so at times I got a little lost and would have to catch up quickly.Basically everything else in this film is great. The acting all around is fantastic. Daniel-Day Lewis plays Lincoln so well, he was so likable, like a grandfather, and I had to keep reminding myself that he was Daniel-Day Lewis. He played it so likable, but also somewhat flawed, as his performance and the make up showed that he clearly hasn't been sleeping much. Everyone else from the veterans to the the boy playing Lincoln's youngest son were all great. The film also has an interesting plot, like I said it could get confusing at times, but I found some of the stuff it brought up to be interesting. Like are they technically stealing property by abolishing slavery. Production value wise it's amazing, the costumes, the make-up, the set design, lighting, everything looks great, but that's Steven Spielberg for you. And I like that it has a sense of humor, that's one of the reasons I don't plan on watching 'Shindler's List' again, because it was just so depressing. And since I'm not a history nut, I can't say how well this informs on the presidency of Abraham Lincoln, but at least this film acknowledges that Lincoln had more than one son.Lincoln is a great film with fantastic acting, amazing production value, and and interesting story. It's only downfalls are a few pacing issues and being a bit too confusing at times. But those problems don't stop this from being one of the best films of the year, and a great film on Steven Spielberg's resume.",9,1,3,23 December 2012
Brave," One of Pixar's weaker films, but still very good
","After the critical disappointment that was Cars 2, people started to trash Pixar. They seem to have put the company on such a high pedestal, that one movie that wasn't a masterpiece was a sign that the company is never going to make a great movie again. Well I do love Pixar, and have absolutely loved several of their films, there are some movies that I just consider pretty good films that aren't masterpieces. The two Cars movies, Ratatouille, most of Up, and A Bug's Life, most of these were very good movies, but didn't reach amazing standards. And Brave lands in that category as well.The major issue with this movie is the fact that the story is pretty cliché and very predictable. I knew exactly how the story would end half way through the movie. At times it feels like it's ripping off other movies like 'How to Train Your Dragon' and 'Brother Bear.' The three little boys range from funny to kind of annoying. There's some juvenile humor, but all Pixar movies have that, they have some juvenile humor for the kids, and some jokes for the adults that will go over the kid's heads. And there was a little too much comedy, it often outweighs the dramatic stuff.Which is kind of ashame, because the parts where the movie slows down and has some drama are some of the best parts. I liked the relationship between Merida and her mother, it was how a teenage daughter and her mother would act, despite being a bit cliché. The way the plot gets moving is something that you will either go along with, or it will kill the movie for you. I didn't mind this, I actually kind of enjoyed the way it moved the plot along. It led to some funny moments, and even a few heartwarming moments. I was never bored in the movie, most of the jokes worked, and the climax was enjoyable. But the best part was the animation, the first few seconds when it's just landscape actually made me ask 'is that real?' And the animation on Merida's hair is outstanding, just as good as Repunzel's in 'Tangled.' So while 'Brave' is one of Pixar's weaker movies, it's still a good one. The plot is predictable, but it has some really good characters and great animation, plus some good humor and a fun fantasy element. It's a great family movie, I would put it one step above 'A Bug's Life' and one step below 'Ratatouille,' not really one I will watch over and over, but a good film that you and your children should enjoy.",8,2,3,28 October 2012
Paranormal Activity," Wonderfully Creepy
","I've never heard of a horror franchise in which the first film was the weakest. At least in my opinion, but of all three Paranormal Activities released so far this is my least favorite. That doesn't mean I don't like it, in fact when I first saw it I jumped on the bandwagon of 'this is the scariest movie I've ever seen in my life.' Now I do know that this movie is very polarizing, and I can see why people hate it so much, but for me, I don't have too many complaints about it.Yeah, it can be very slow at times, it's not a movie that will continuously try and scare you, it needs build up, and for some people the build up is too long and doesn't pay off enough. Micah, one of the two main characters is...well...kind of an idiot. Throughout the movie you want to just go inside the movie and yell at him to listen to Katie. And the day scenes drag on a litte too long, you want to get to night because that's when things get really interesting. And the characters may explain too much to you, they always look over the footage and watch the scary parts.This is one of the creepiest films I've ever seen in my life. I mean, seriously, any time it turns to night, I begin to get so tense, knowing that these two characters are being watched. And it always leads to a great jump scare. It build gradually, the first few are so small that you may not even realize that something is happening, but then by the last night things just start going so crazy. Katie is a great character, reminding me of myself. If I were in her shoes, that is pretty much how I would act. I like the sense of humor it has so that it isn't completely dread filled. And the ending is fantastic, I've seen the alternate endings, and while they were cool to see, this is the best in my opinion.This is a love it or hate it movie, and I love it. Yeah it can be slow at times, and Micah is a bit of an idiot. But if you love haunted house movies, or found footage movies, than you owe it to yourself to see this movie.",8,1,2,20 February 2010
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," What up with the hate?
","OK, true this film does have a certified fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and currently a 6.9 on IMDb. However it seems that everyone on the internet hates this movie. Why? Because it isn't as good as the 1971 film Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. It seems that that film was one that should not have been remade. Alright, let me make this clear, I LOVE Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, it's a classic, I've loved it ever since I was a kid, and it still holds a special place in my heart. But it is a terrible adaptation.I didn't get around to reading the book till long after I saw the original movie. However when I did I found out that that film had changed a lot, and I mean a lot. This film, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, follows much more closely to the book. Charlie's father is still alive, the songs are more closely related to the books, they have squirrels and bad nuts, and more. Now true the film does have two big problems with it.One is that Gene Wilder was a much, much better Willy Wonka than Johnny Depp. The other is the subplot involving Wonka's father, this was never in the book, and seems out of place since the book is supposed to be about Charlie. But overall the movie has the same message as the book, as the original film did too.I can't decide which adaptation I like more, Willy Wonka is more nostalgic for me, while Charlie is much closer to the book. I love them both, but I can't deny that this film is much much closer to the book.",8,3,5,10 January 2012
The Dark Knight," Really good, but not as good as everyone says
","Let me make this clear! I am giving this movie an 8.5! This movie, is a great movie, let me get that out of the way right now. But! It is not the single greatest movie ever made in the history of man. I don't orgasm at the mere mention of it's title. It's a great movie, but it isn't perfect.My biggest problem is that their are just a lot of parts that don't make sense. I think this movie should have ended like two other times before the actual ending. One being when the Joker goes to the mob and kills the guy with a pencil, I think that mobster's would probably kill him right then and there. Second is when the Joker gives a gun straight to Harvey Dent. He convinces him that he wasn't responsible for Rachel's death, he only kidnapped her. Yeah, so you're the reason she's dead, why didn't Harvey shoot him and then go after Batman? The movie tries way too hard to be clever that sometimes it feels a little pretentious. I mean seriously, was there any reason that Batman had to take the fall for Dent. Just say Dent went crazy, killed some people, and Batman stopped him. Bam, Batman is the hero, and Gotham has it's symbol of hope or whatever. There are some other nitpicks I have, but let's just go to the good stuff.While the movie itself isn't as good as people say, The Joker sure is. He is actually quite terrifying at times. But besides that, he was also very clever, and sometimes even funny. The opening scene with the bank robbery was fantastic. It looks fantastic, the acting is great, and it's very well written. It's very long, but because there are so many things going on, it's forgivable. The action scenes are good but noting mindblowing. Harvey Dent's transiton into madness feels natural and tragic. You really feel sorry for Batman since most of the city turns on him. And the movie really shows balls by killing off it's main heroine half way through the movie.The Dark Knight, is a great movie, but it isn't quite as good as people say it is. Some things don't make sense or aren't explained very well, and it tries a little too hard to be clever. But it does do so many things right. But the best part is the Joker, he was scary, clever, and even funny at times. While there are other great parts in the movie, I think that the movie wouldn't be nearly as good if it weren't for him. So while the movie itself isn't quite as good as people may say, the Joker sure is. So yes, this is a great film, and I am exited for the The Dark Knight Rises, but the hype is ridiculous.",9,2,6,14 March 2010
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Good movie, Mediocre Adabtation
","Plot: Harry saves his cousin Dudley from two dementors, but by using magic outside of school he needs to go to a trial. After being found not guilty, he spends the rest of the summer at his Godfathers Sirius' house. When he goes back to school, his new Defence against the Dark Arts teacher Miss. Umbridge basically tortures him, Hagrid is missing, Dumbledore won't look at him, and Harry keeps having dreams about a door at the end of a long hallway. Review: Let me just say this, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a good film, but as an adaptation, it's only OK. In terms of an adaptation it's basically about as good as The Last Airbender, as in, they got enough for the basic story, but there's so much cut out. This is the only Potter film not to be written by Steve Kloves, and the first directed by David Yates. It certainly shows that this film had a different writer, and to be fair I'm not saying the writer Michael Goldenberg (who also did Green Latern) did a bad job, but he could've done much better. For example Quittich is completely gone, Harry saw his dad tormenting Snape in the Penesive, not by memory charm, young Lily doesn't appear, We don't see St. Mungo's and don't see Neville's parents, Rita Skeeter isn't in it, Kreacher barely appears, Aunt Petunia doesn't get a Howler, Hedwig isn't injured, and much more is either left out or changed. One other thing I don't like is the message of friendship is shoved down your throats near the end, I know that was a theme of the book but it wasn't forcing it. Also a minor nitpick, in the first book, it was established that Harry could grow his hair back in one night, so why is his hair so short in this movie?After all that ranting, let's talk about why I like this film. Once again, the actors do a great job, and this film also also gives us two of the best casting decisions after the three main leads. Imelda Staunton was perfects as Umbridge, I wanted to smack her in the face. And Evanna Lynch was absolutely flawless in her portrayal of Luna. The special effects are great, the last battle between Voldemort and Dumbledore was pulled off well in my opinion, some say that Dumbledore looked scared and was weaker than in the book, but I don't think that was how the book portrayed the battle. The effects in that scene alone make this film worth watching. And the humor works really well, and like I said, it follows the main plot of the show, just like The Last Airbender, but people seemed to hate that film.So yes, I like Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, it's fun, a good film, but as an adaptation, it's mediocre. Because of this, it is my least favorite film in the series.",7,1,2,15 March 2010
2001: A Space Odyssey," Changed cinema from a direction point of view.
","I finally saw 2001: A Space Oddysey about a month ago after almost a lifetime of hearing how great it was. How it changed the art of cinema, and is Stanley Kubrick's Magnum Opus. Then a little bit before I watched it, I saw the review by Confused Matthew. Confused Matthew, for those who don't know, is an internet reviewer who mostly reviews movies that he didn't like, that the mojority did like, examples include: Back to the Future Part 2, The Lion King, No Country for Old Men, Minority Report, and this. Normally I disagree with him, but unfortuantly this time I agreed, while 2001: A Space Oddysey is no where near terrible, it is probably one of the most over rated movies I've ever seen.Really the best way I can review this film is to just tell you to go watch Matthew's review, because he pretty much says what I think.Now I do agree that this film did change cinema in terms of direction, visuals, all that. This truly is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen, had I never known, I never would've guessed that this movie was made in 1968. Kubrick is a great director, and now that I've seen a some of his movies, I can consider him one of my favorites. But really, the best way to describe this movie is 'empty.' I literally fast forwarded through an hour of this movie, I nearly fell asleep twice, and it is because half of the movie is just spaceships flying across space, looking at landscape, people walking around. And sure, the visuals look nice, but look at the six Star Wars movies, they looked nice, and they actually had plots. Even though I fast forwarded through an hour of a 2 hour 14 minute movie, I didn't miss anything.They go to Jupiter, the HAL 9000 goes crazy, kills most of the crew, then Bowman goes through the stargate finds himself as an old man and then turns into a fetus. What does it all mean? You know what, I couldn't care less. Sure HAL was pretty cool, but he really was only in about twenty-thirty minutes of the movie. Yes, I know that I'm pretty much repeating what Confused Matthew said, and I tried to give it a chance, I even came on to MFC right after watching it and saying it was basically OK. Yes, the visuals are amazing, but if you want to see a really good Kubrick movie, go see THe Shining, that's a brilliant movie. Hell, go see A Clockwork Orange, it was weird, but good, I think. Full Metal Jacket, sure the first half is far better than the second, but at least stuff happens in that second half.I know that this film is loved by millions of people, and to be honest, I don't hate the film, but I don't see myself ever watching it again. If you like it good for you, but I'm with Matthew on this one.",4,17,33,8 September 2011
Toy Story," Let me just say it...My favorite Animated movie
","I really like animation, just the idea that you can basically take any idea, and characters, and make them do anything you want. Now a days there are three major animation companies, Disney, Dreamworks, and Pixar, sure there are others, but they never make films as famous as these three. And of those three, without a doubt the best working today is Pixar, they revolutionized animation by creating the first CGI animated movie, and that's what I'm talking about.Toy Story is not the most complicated or mature animated film you'll ever see. It's a simple story of a cowboy doll named Woody, who is neglected by his owner Andy after he gets a Buzz Lightyear Action Figure. Then by some weird circumstance, they both end up in the home of Andy's neighbor Sid, who is basically what would happen if you put Hitler and Osama bin Laden together, made them a teenager, and turned Jews and Americans into Toys.The animation is great, as the first fully CGI animated movie, it's beautiful to look at, but the characters are so engaging that you forget about the animation. And there are so many hilarious moments that any flaws with the film are forgivable. But really the only flaw I can see is that the humans look more like toys than the actual toys.Everyone has their favorite animated movie, some have one of the films in the Disney Animated canon, some say one of Dreamworks movies, maybe even a Don Bluth or Blu Sky movie, or another Pixar flick, but my favorite animated movie is Toy Story, maybe it's just nostalgia, but it's still a wonderful film.",10,0,0,5 September 2011
Taken," Really Good Action Flick
","I recently watched Taken to see what all the fuss was about. And now that i've watched it I can tell why. Taken is one of the most entertaining movies I've seen in my life. The only plot you need to know to have fun with this movie is this, 'Liam Neeson is fighting and killing people to get his daughter back.' There is a lot more to it than that, but think about it too hard, and it won't be the entertaining movie everyone is calling it. Liam Neeson is kinda like Swarshinager in Commando, by that I mean that their both trying to find their daughter who has been kidnapped.I enjoyed this movie, and I know I'm not alone, but it isn't perfect. some parts of the film were a bit boring and tedious. And I tried understanding what was going on, but the plot was so confusing it lost me in a few places. Like I said, this is entertaining, just don't try to find any hidden messages.",7,1,2,17 June 2010
Avatar," Good movie
","Two things first, one, I couldn't decide on wheather to give this film a 7 or 8, so I gave it an 8, but i would probably only give it a 7.5. Second, I just saw this film, on DVD, not on the big screen, not in 3D, not even on blu-ray, and I found it entertaining.Everyone seems to be calling this film either great or horrible, and the reason is because without the effect, this film is just a rip off of dances with wolves. Well, I never saw that film, I found this film good on the small screen, though the effects aren't as good as they would have been on the big screen, they were still good.So yes, it was a good movie, but does it deserve highest grossing film of all time, no. I do say that this film is in my top 10 of 2009, and even my top 100 films. But it isn't good enough to be my favorite film of all time.I give it a 7.5 for entertainment and how nicely it's made.",8,1,3,28 April 2010
Toy Story 2," Not as good as the first, but still a great movie
","A lot of people say that Toy Story 2 is a sequel that is better than the original. Well, the first Toy Story is my favorite animated movie of all time, so of course I have to disagree. But that doesn't stop the fact that this is still an amazing movie.Like the first, the animation is fantastic, even better this time. The old characters are engaging, and it's funny as heck. New characters are added this time, such as Jessie, the yodeling cowgirl, who I thought was a little annoying in the beginning, but began to really like as the film went on. Bullseye, a horse who make so much emotion with his eyes and mouth. The Prospector, who acts sort of like a father figure to Woody, and Barbie, who is so sweet it's almost sickening, but man is she fun.There are a lot more villains in this film, the main one is Al, who flat out steals Woody. Zurg, Buzz Lightyear's arch enemy, some might say that the second Buzz is another villain, and there's even a surprise villain, who I won't give away.The movie deals with a lot more adult themes, such as growing up. Woody begins to wonder what will happen to him when Andy grows up and doesn't play with him anymore.The plot is so jam packed that I won't go into it, over all, it's still an excellent movie, but I still like the first one more, even if this one may be better in it's story.",9,0,1,5 September 2011
Drag Me to Hell," I get the horror part, but I didn't see much comedy
","(This review may contain Spoilers) Before I start, I should let you know that I have never seen the Spiderman Trilogy, or the Evil Dead Trilogy, so I am unfimiliar with Sam Rami's work.I bought Drag me to Hell at Wal-mart remembering that I had heard great things about it, calling it one of the best horror-comedy's ever made. Was it? Well, the short answer is, no. One reason, it wasn't funny. I get that it was supposed to be campy, and there were a few humorous parts, but overall, it just wasn't the laugh-out-loud comedy I was hoping for. Two things really ruined the comedy for me. One was the death of the kitten, I mean come on, a kitten, that would be if the movie stopped, came to you, and hit you in the stomach. The second was the ending, I can't see the funny in a nice woman being dragged down to Hell, to burn for eternity. Just to be clear, she never did anything wrong, and she is being punished with everlasting pain and suffering. Unless they make a sequel with her being a stripper, or being whiner to the devil, I can't see it ever becoming a comedy.But it definitely works as a horror film. So if you want to watch Drag me to Hell, I suggest not expecting many laughs.",7,0,0,21 July 2010
The Artist," A great film, but praised for a gimmick.
","The Artist is going to win best picture. Don't try and fool yourselves people, this film is going to win. True Hugo was nominated for more awards, but this film has been so critically praised that Hugo barely stands a chance.Not that I'm really complaining, because I really did enjoy this film. I went into it, just hoping for an entertaining movie, and that's what I got. I was invested in the story, I enjoyed the characters, it was funny at times, truly heart breaking at times, and had me interested throughout it's running time. The movie thankfully isn't too long, because if it was it would have gotten on my nerves near the end, but an hour and a half is perfect for this film.The actors do a great job even though they are not able to speak. The camera work is great, it has a beautiful score, and it's just a flat out fun movie to watch.Yet despite that, the only reason this is even nominated for best picture is because of the fact that it's a silent film in 2011. It's a great film, but it's that gimmick that is giving it the praise. This film would not be the Holy Grail of the Academy Awards if it wasn't a silent film in 2011.The Artist is a great film, its funny, dramatic, entertaining...but in the end, it's still a gimmick movie.",8,0,5,25 February 2012
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," It's at least the most entertaining in the series.
","Well, it's finally over, or at least it's supposed to be over since I hear they're thinking about spin offs. The last Twilight, and just as a refresher, here's what I thought of the other four. Twilight: Didn't like it. New Moon: Not really good, but had enough moments to be watchable. Eclipse: I would say was OK. Breaking Dawn Part 1: Didn't like it. And now we have hit the final film, and it's certainly the most entertaining in the series, at least for half of it maybe.Because when this movie slows down, it REALLY slows down. It can get so boring at points that I wanted to just stop watching. Bella's exposition narration was, well, as pointless as it was in 'The Last Airbender.' But that film at least was cut down and tried to fit a season of a TV show into one movie. This is fitting one half a book into a movie that's the end of a franchise, I don't think anyone will find it weird if it's longer. The actress who played Renesmee wasn't very good, I'm sure she tried her hardest, but would it kill her to have any other expression other than just blank staring. And I thought the main villain was supposed to be Dakota Fanning, but she doesn't do anything, literally, I don't even remember her talking.Now for the positives: Bella actually does stuff other than mope and complain. She did start to get better in the last movie, but now she's actually fighting and doing stuff. And it's a good thing too, if Bella turned into a Vampire than didn't do anything, I would have been so angry. The movie seems to have a sense of humor in the beginning that pokes fun at the series, allowing for some actual entertainment. The villains are actually a threat, the leader being so over the top at times that I found myself laughing. And the final battle was actually really fun. It's just vampires and werewolves beating the crap out of each other, and it was actually quite entertaining. Thank God, since the movie was being very slow up to this point.Now let's talk the twist, I won't spoil it, but it's the only twist ending I've ever seen that both infuriated me, and was also awesome at the same time. So...good job Twilight, you ended your series with you best, or at least most entertaining movie, even if it was still only just OK, so don't mess it up.",6,3,9,29 November 2012
Super 8," Scary, Funny, and has a nice feel
","It has been almost a year since this movie came out, hard to believe isn't it, I can still remember the hype, everyone going crazy about how much they were looking forward to the film. Yet after it finally came out, it seems that so many people were disappointed with the film. Sure it has good reviews, but look up the film on IMDb, look at the featured review, I guarantee it will most likely be someone saying it sucked, or was only OK. Well unlike so many other people, I absolutely loved this movie.From what I get, a lot of people were disappointed was because it was too similar to other movies like E.T. and the Goonies. Um, yeah, that was the point. The movie was supposed to be like an 80's Spielberg movie.The film was directed by J.J. Abrams, who is quickly becoming one of my favorite filmmakers. I enjoyed Mission Impossible 3, he produced Cloverfield, one of my favorite movies, and while Star Trek put me to sleep, it looked like he did a good job from what I saw of it. Super 8 looks fantastic, homaging classic Spielberg while also having Abram's own style. The child actors were all fantastic, they didn't seem like actors, they seemed like real kids, and created some funny and memorable characters, my favorite being Charlie.The effects are top notch, some might complain that there is too much CGI, but come on guys, this was 2011, be happy there are any practical effects. The train derailment was so overblown that it was awesome. And the production value was fantastic, I was born in the 90's, so I can't speak from experience, but I always believed that they were in 1979.It's hilarious, especially the kid who has an unhealthy obsession with explosives. The diologue is great, the kids swear, like, you know, KIDS. My brother is 12 and he swears more than I do. But the film is also really scary at times. I jumped quite a bit. Which brings me to the sound. I have never thought more about Sound Mixing more than in this movie (Why wasn't this movie nominated for any Oscars?) I had only one big problem with this movie, and that was the ending. The last seven minutes aren't really bad, but it seems the writer didn't know how to end it. I won't spoil anything, but some things just don't make sense.Super 8 was a great movie, it seems quite a lot of people were disappointed with it, but personally with the exception of the last seven minutes or so, I was completely satisfied.9/10 Very Mint!!!",9,1,1,17 August 2011
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," I Like it more than the first
","This my be weird too read, but I actually think this movie is better than the original. I'm not talking like Back to the Future 1 and 2 where I like the second one more but acknowledge that the first is better. No, I actually think that this movie is objectively better than the first film. Now don't get me wrong, I like the first film, but I just think this is stronger. But what do I know.Basically whenever someone criticizes this movie they will say it sucks because it's just a rehash of the first movie. And they are technically right, but that's one of the things I like about it. And the film sort of knows this and pokes fun at it sometimes. For me, the bad stuff boils down to breaking the laws of physics sometimes, and not enough of Kevin's family.But everything that works in the first movie works here. And it fixes some of the stuff that didn't work for me. In the first movie I thought it was kind of contrived how Kevin just automatically assumed he made his family disappear and how he never called the cops and just tell them that the buglers were coming to his house. In this movie those problems are fixed. I love the scenes in the hotel, Tim Curry is just so much fun to watch. I actually think it's funnier than the first, and it still gives that Christmas feeling.I know no one will agree with me, but in my opinion, this sequel actually is better than the original.",8,0,1,5 December 2012
Rio," A flawed but Fun Movie
","I'm probably being too nice on the rating for this movie, it probably deserves more of a 7. It does have flaws, the biggest one being the fact that the film is extremely predictable, I knew exactly how the movie was going to end by the time the movie got to twenty minutes. However that's the only really big flaw, true some of the characters I didn't care about, and one of the songs is, well, stupid, but I can forgive those because I was having a good time.I really enjoyed the two leads, and the voice acting by Jesse Eisenberg and Anne Hathaway is really good. The villain's fun too, and has a really good back story, unfortunately the song he sings to describe it isn't. I enjoyed the humans, but if they weren't in the movie I wouldn't really care. And the comic reliefs were, actually funny.The animation is absolutely gorgeous, where Rango has outstanding detail, Rio has so many colors, that it's a feast for the eyes.And the songs, are really good, save for the villains, my only problem, they're a little short.",8,0,0,12 August 2011
How to Train Your Dragon," Dreamworks Animation has finally made a Masterpiece
","Dreamworks animation has pretty much always been a poor man's animation studio when compared to Pixar. Sort of, the Kmart version of Pixar. They made movies that were just supposed to be fun, but not really have much in terms of story or characters. The Shrek movies, Madagascar movies, Over the Hedge. I don't their movies, I actually like quite a few of them, but none of them really impressed me. Until this movie.The plot isn't original, anyone who critiques this movie will tell you that and milk it for all it's worth. The plot is the same as E.T. and Lilo and Stitch. But you know what, I don't care.The characters are what make this movie more interesting. I love the relationship between Hiccup and his dad despite how cliché it is. Hiccup kind of reminds me of myself. And Toothless, well, kind of looks like a mix between a bat and a cat, and is one of the cutest things I've ever seen in my life. The animation is absolutely amazing, the colors and detail show that they really cared about this movie. The action is also good, man do I wish I saw this movie in 3D. And it's just funny.While How to train Your Dragon may be a little bit cliché in it's story departement, it's also really fun, has some great characters, great animation, and clever humor. As far as I'm concerned, this is Dreamworks Animation's masterpiece.",9,0,0,26 June 2011
Limitless," Liked it, but it could've been better
","This film had a really cool premise, great actors, some interesting action scenes, but when it was over, I felt like it could have been a little stronger. The premise is that a man gets a drug that allows him to take full control of his brain, since we only use about 20% of our brain's actual power. So he basically knows everything, he can also go back into his mind and remember anything that happened to him in the past. The acting is great, Bradley Cooper, Robert De Niro, Abbie Cornish were all good. The action was entertaining and the visuals were minimal but very well handled. However, since it has such great things about it, the film just didn't have the punch that I was expecting. I was hoping for something mindblowing and what I got was a good movie, that stopped short of being great. I can't explain it, there's really nothing bad in it, I was just hoping for more.6.5/10",6,0,0,4 January 2012
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," A great start, to a great franchise
","To put it simply, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a great way to start a francise, a way to find out what works and what doesn't. It's very similar to what Confused Matthew said about the first Spider Man and the Star Trek Reboot, a film to find out how to make the rest of the series will work. The film overrall is great, but since it's the first film, there are a few problems, like the child actors. I mean, compared to most child actors, their frekin amazing, but let's be happy that they got better as the series went on. Plus some of the special effects didn't age well, such as the troll scene. The troll itself still looks pretty cool, but sometimes it so obviously a CGI Harry.However, as an adabtation, it's one of the best I've ever seen, although I have always wanted to see Peeves in live action. And overall, the production design is absolutely amazing, Warner Brothers were obviously confident that this film would be successful and lead to a franchise to put so much money into it. And quite literally, every actor fits their roles, such as Alan Rickman, Richard Harris, and Robbie Cultrane.In conclusion, compared to the other films, it feels a little dated, but I still think it's a great film.",8,0,1,9 August 2011
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Entertaining, but the plot needed more from the book
","Plot: After the Dark Mark appears at the Quittich World Cup, Harry is selected to take part in the twiwizard tournament. Except for one problem, Harry never entered. And with his scar burning more than ever, and teenage hormones starting to kick in, Harry learns that his fourth year at Hogwarts, is going to be his hardest. Review: Before we start, let me just say this, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is my favorite book of all time. It has action, suspense, and has finally taken a dark enough turn. The movie adaptation just wasn't as good. Oh don't get me wrong, I think this movie is ridiculously entertaining, but in terms of an adaptation it just isn't as strong. For example, Hermiones S.P.E.W. campaign is never mentioned, and since we don't know that elves work in the kitchen, some people will be confused when the elves attack in the last movie. Also the whole Rita Skeeter can turn into a beetle is gone, there's literally only one class in the whole film, and there are literally only three scenes between the second and third tasks. The second task was in mid February and the third was in late June. Yet in the movie the second task ends, they find Crouch's body, Harry goes into Dumbledore's office and finds the penesive, and Snape interrogates Harry about his potion ingredients. Also Winky doesn't make an appearance.After that last paragraph, you may think I think this is a horrible adaptation, but it isn't, it's actually quite good. There are some things that I thought they might cut out that they didn't, such as Fred and George trying to enter the tournament. But since the fourth is my favorite book, I guess this film would disappoint in the story department. But it doesn't disappoint in the action, the first task was so well done, and one change from the book that was a major improvement. I'm sorry, but Harry just flying around the dragon arena, a little boring. The special effects are amazing is some places, and the acting just keeps getting better. Also I like the whole romantic elements, Cho and Harry's works, even if it is a little rushed. And this is when Ron and Hermione are really starting to get it on, the buckbeak snapped at Harry part in POA started it, but now it's kicking into high gear.Overall Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a pretty good adaptation, but it could have been better. But as a film it's awesome. It's extremely entertaining, it's dark, funny, and has a really good romantic elements. But it is one of the weaker entries, at least in terms of an adaptation.",8,0,1,9 August 2011
Thor," Thankfully they go Over-the-Top
","Thor seems like a movie that should have been really really bad when you hear the premise. The God of Thunder is punished by his father for disobeying him. So he sends him to Earth where he meets a college student and falls in love. Meanwhile his father has fallen ill and Thor's brother, who becomes evil, takes over as king. Yeah, doesn't really sound like it would turn out good, but surprisingly it came out pretty well.I think the only reason this movie worked as well as it did was because they played it so over the top. Everything is overblown, and that's why the film is entertaining. It's downright hilarious in a few parts. Had they taken itself as seriously as The First Iron Man, or the first two-thirds of the Incredible Hulk this film would have been a disasaster.The character's themselves are fine, Thor starts out as a bit of an ass, but since they play it so over the top I didn't mind it as much as Iron Man. The villain was pretty cool. And I really liked Darcy, I don't know why exactly, but I just really liked her.However, because the film is so over the top, when it does try to take itself seriously, it doesn't always work. Sometimes it just comes off as unintentionally hilarious. Other problems I have: the action is too short at times and too few of them. But like I said, it's funny enough to where I forgive that. I didn't like how quickly Thor just adjusted to human life. This may be a spoiler, but after Loki tells him his father is dead and he can't return, he mopes for one night, and then seems like he's perfectly happy with it. Come on Thor you can't get over this that quickly.Really this film just didn't blow me away. It was entertaining, but there was only one part where I was really impressed. That was the scene at the end of the credits. I won't spoil it, but of all the pre-Avengers movies post credits scenes, this one is my favorite",7,2,4,4 January 2012
The Happening," Not perfect, but no where near as bad as people make it out to be
","The Happening opened in June of 2008, and over the past three years, it has gotten harder and harder to find a positive review for it, in fact every time I do see a positive review on youtube or something I like it immediately. Under no circumstances is the movie perfect, but I feel that it succeeds in what it is trying to be, a B-Movie. The trailers never really showed this, but days before the film came out, Shyamalan was being interviewed, and said, 'We're making an excellent B movie, that's our goal.' I would classify this film as a horror film, that never takes itself to seriously, and that's why I like it. I hate when a movie takes itself too seriously, sometimes it can work, but usually the movie just ends up being dull. While the film has some really graphic scenes such as the hair clip through the neck, and being run over with the lawn mower, it also has some really funny moments, like talking to a plastic plant, or the crazy old lady who wonders if Elliot is eying her drink. Because it never takes itself seriously, it is a fun movie, you get the graphic deaths that disturb you, then you also get the funny, stupid scenes that will cheer you up so that you never are too depressed.Now that I've discussed the misunderstanding people have with this film, lets move on to some of the other things I like. The film really does look amazing, I'll admit Shyamalan was never that good of a writer (exept with Signs, but even in the Sixth Sense, it didn't take a master story teller to hide the twist), but he is a really great director. He never just sets up the camera, he doesn't shake it to add realism, cough 'Hurt Locker' cough, and he doesn't jump cut every five second, cough 'Wanted' cough. But there are other things I did like.For example the acting is not nearly as bad as people make it out to be, seriously, on IMDb, a user called the acting cringe inducing. Now I will admit, Zooey Deschanel was HORRIBLE. She gave easily the worst performance, she was fine when she was silent, but when she talked, it was pretty terrible. However I think that Mark Walberg actually did a pretty good job, nothing outstanding, but he wasn't the completely wooden performance that people make him out to be. The rest of the cast is OK, even the little girl, she has only one line but she does so much with complete silence, maybe it's just because she so cute that I don't want anything to happen to her.Which leads me to my next point, I like these characters, I don't want anything to happen to them. It's like Roland Emmerichs movies, everyone else says there nothing but eye Candy movies, but I actually do care about the characters. I can't say that I cared about Elliot and Alma's relationship problems that much, but I didn't want them to die, so something went right.The film does have a few good jump scares, and it takes chances by killing people under 18, that actually look like their under 18.Then theirs the ending, why do people have problems with it, what is so bad about the ending that pisses people off, is it the fact that it the fact that it shows the epidemic is happening somewhere else.Under no circumstances is The Happening a perfect film, but it's a fun, creepy movie, with decent performances, cool death scenes, and likable characters, that I'm amazed that this film got so much hate, I mean, it got nominated for worst picture and Wanted didn't. Oh and one last thing, the film has probably one of the best tag lines of all time.",8,0,1,29 March 2010
The Matrix Reloaded," Not as good as the first, but I thought it was fun
","Do you hate Matrix Reloaded? If you do, tell me why. Let me guess, it had something to do with too much plot that didn't resolve in a satisfactory way, and the whole movie was just a big action scene. Well hold on. Those isn't a problem with this film, thsose were problem with the third film, The Matrix Revolutions. Interesting how when the film was first released it got pretty good reviews from both critics and audiences, yet after the third film was released, it's called one of the worst sequels of all time. Well I'm sick of it. I'm not saying this movie was as good as the first, not even close. But it certainly a very good sequel, and a damn fun film that doesn't deserve the hate it gets.Basically I don't hate much in this film, it's biggest problem is that most of the aspects of the film are not as good as the first one. The first film had a very interesting and though provoking story. This movie's story is good, but it can get a bit confusing and boring at times. The acting and new characters are more hit and miss. Some of the CGI hasn't aged well. But as a film itself the worst I can say is that it can be a little boring at times, and some things happen without much of an explanation.However I will say that if you didn't like the first Matrix because you thought it was boring, I think you may actually like this one. As much as I love the first movie, the pacing was a bit uneven. In this movie, the pacing is perfect, development, action, development, action, etc. I really like the character of Link, this movie has a great sense of humor, without going to over the top. The story is good, not as great as the first movie, but it sets up a plot to be resolved in the next movie. But the best parts are the action scenes. In the first movie I appreciated the story first, then the action. In this one, the action is simply incredible, despite some aged CG, some of it still looks damn amazing. The kung fu fights are well shot, and beautifly choreographed. And the car chase is one of the best I have ever seen. Seriously, anyone who says this film has nothing good in it should be punched, that scene alone deserved it's own mini Oscar or something.No, this isn't as good as the first movie, but it certainly isn't one of the worst sequels of all time. It set up a good story, and then Revolutions dropped the ball. So I recommend you give it another watch if you haven't watched it since 2003.",8,0,1,22 August 2011
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Still my favorite of the franchise
","Let me just get this out of the way, I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!! I love a lot of the Harry Potter films, but not only is this one my favorite, it's in my top 3 favorite films. Sometimes it's number 1, but I always juggle it along with Jurassic Park and Empire Strikes Back. To put it simply, everything is right with this movie.Unlike the first film that made a failthful adabtation, but wasn't dark enough. COS gave us one of the best book to film adabtations, along with making it just as dark as the movies that followed. The acting is much better this time around, and the special effects are incredibly well done. Some may say they look dated, I don't think so, they look just as real to me now as back when I first saw it in 2002, (well OK, maybe that snake during Dueling club looked kind of cheap, but still.) The book isn't my favorite of the series, but the movie gets all the good stuff, while taking out a few things I don't like, such as that Valentines Day thing, and not wasting time when Hagrid is taken to Azkaban and going straight into the forrest. Although it would have been cool to see that Deathday party.Overall, it's not the best movie of all time, but I still Love it.",10,1,3,14 February 2010
Die Hard," A great action, and Christmas Movie
","I didn't get around to watching Die Hard until about Christmas of 2010. I had heard great things about it, and what do you know, it was great. Die Hard, and it's sequel Die Hard 2, are two of my five movie that I have to watch at Christmas time, along with the first two Home Alones and the Polar Express.Now there are two things that really make this movie work. The action, and the comedy. The action of course is fantastic, it's like picking one person off one by one. John McClane is like a killer in a horror movie. And the comedy is very well done. I love Han's Gruber reading off what John wrote on his henchman's shirt.'Now I have a machine gun...Ho Ho Ho.' I also jumped at a few of the good guy death scenes, there aren't many, but I jumped. Part of me wants to just go watch this movie right now, but I have to wait till Christmas. Oh well.YipeeKiAy Motherf**kers!!!",10,1,2,11 January 2012
Zero Dark Thirty," Suspesful, well made thriller
","So I originally thought that this movie would at least have a chance at best picture, but since Bigellow didn't get a nomination for best director, it seems it's chances are slim. So Zero Dark Thirty is directed by Kathryn Bigellow and written by Mark Boal, the same people who made the Hurt Locker, and if you read my review you know that I wasn't a fan of that movie, I actually think it's one of the most overrated movies ever made. And well Zero Dark Thirty is not perfect, it definitely makes up for The Hurt Locker.This movie is two and a half hours long, and it feels like it, some scenes go by way too slowly, and of all the characters, I remember one name, literally one name. The shaky cam and fast editing isn't nearly as bad as it was in Hurt Locker, but it still is present and while it sometimes is used well sometimes it's just used for the sake of using it. And I don't think I'm spoiling anything, but at the end when they finally get bin Laden, it goes by so fast, it seems very anti climatic.But the main character Maya is very likable, she seems believable that she would want to hunt this guy down. The suspenseful scenes are very suspenseful and don't just feel like padding to make the movie longer. It has some funny moments, the production value is great, it pretty much just fixes most of the problems I had with Hurt Locker. Some scenes can get very hard to watch, and I'm not exactly sure how much of this is true, but it seems to be pretty facutal.Zero Dark Thirty is a very good film with great suspense, well done action scenes, a likable lead, great acting, high production design, and some really awesome explosions that I honestly didn't see coming. It definitely is better than the writer and director's last movie, and while I won't be rushing out to get it on DVD, I may watch this again in the future.",8,2,12,10 January 2013
War of the Worlds," Fun invasion movie
","Spielberg's War of the Worlds seems to split people right down the middle, half the people like it, half the people don't. And if you don't like this movie, I can totally understand why. But personally, I really, really like this movie, and would actually put it as one of my favorite Spielberg movies, ranking up there with Jurassic Park and E.T.Now like I said, this movie is not perfect, there are quite a number of plot holes, some right in front of your face that are hard to ignore (how did they film the lightning storm if the lightning caused all electricity to go out.) Racheal can be very annoying at times. Half the time she is screaming, and the other half she talks like an adult. And some people may not like the fact that the film takes place in present day New Jersey and not London in the late 1800s like in the book. Well personally I don't mind this, and the reason is to show that the greatest power in the world can't defend themselves against the aliens.Personally I just find this movie to be a lot of fun. The action and special effects are amazing. The scene where the tripod comes out of the ground has some of the best special effects I've ever seen. The acting is good, Tom Cruise really plays an average American dad very well. I like how we follow an average family as this happens, and not the military. If we followed the military then it would have been too much like Independence Day. And it does a good job of using post 9/11 fear to make dust and debris scary, even though Cloverfield would do it better three years later.War of the Worlds is just a plain fun disaster sci-fi movie. It isn't perfect, but it didn't need to be, it's a fun movie with great action and effects, good acting, and enough of a plot to get you through it's two hour running time.",9,1,2,29 April 2010
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Just a fun flick
","Die Hard with a Vengeance is truly a 90's action movie, maybe it's just me, but this movie probably wouldn't have turned out the way it did if it were made in any other decade. It's so overblown, yet still really funny and entertaining.Basically the only real problem this movie, at least to me, is that it completely throws reality out the window. The first two, yeah they obviously could not have happened in real life, but they defienently tried for realism. This movie just says f**k it and goes so over the top. And yeah it's entertaining, but it does make it feel a little less like a sequel and more like just another 90's action movie. Plus some of the effects are bad. It doesn't have much CGI, but when McClane and Zeus are jumping off the boat it looked terrible. I have some small nitpicks, but that's about it.Really Die Hard 3 is just one of those, leave your brain at the door movies. Don't even try to solve these puzzles because they are way too difficult. Bruce Willis is still great as John McClane, and him and Samuel L. Jackson work really well together. The villain is fun, and love how it ties in with the first movie. The action scenes are great, and very well shot. There is no better way to explain this movie other than just fun. Sure the first two are a little better, but this film is just so cheesy that it makes up for any faults it has.",8,0,0,2 June 2012
Jaws," Not Spielberg's best, but very good.
","I actually avoided this movie when I was a little kid, I loved going into the ocean whenever I went to the beach, so I didn't want that ruined for me. However, when I got older, I finally decided watch it in full. Now of course Jaws is known for being the first film to ever make over 100 million dollars, and starting the summer blockbuster. So I respect the film for that, but is it good? Yeah, I think it's pretty great.Now it's not perfect though, it isn't my favorite Steven Spielberg movie as it is for most people. For one, while I like the main trio, the rest of the cast are kind of forgettable. Brody's wife, the mayor, the kids, their all good, but the reason everyone likes this film is for the main three. You will have to stretch your suspension of disbelief a little far near the end. I can handle not being slowed down by three barrels, but jumping up onto a boat is a little silly. And the film, while still great, has defienently aged. Some of the effects are dated, and of course now we know that sharks usually won't attack people.But is this movie scary, yes it is. It succeeds in not only scaring you in the movie, but after the movie. Imagine your in water at night, all alone, and you suddenly feel something touch your leg. How scary would that be. The first scene is pretty hard to watch, and the film shows guts by killing a kid. The three main characters are great, they're funny, likable, have great chemistry, and I didn't want to see them die. Although Quint did get a little aggrivating with the whole 'no radio' crap. And this is one of the few adabtations that is actually better than the book it is based on. Getting rid of plot points that didn't need to be there. And while I complained about some of the special effects being dated, most of them still look really good. And the fact that they don't show the shark often actually helps the movie.Jaws isn't my favorite Spielberg movie, but it's still a really great film. It's scary, funny, has a trio of great characters, and of course, started the summer blockbuster.",9,0,1,11 August 2011
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Best prequel, and that's saying a lot
","I really liked the other star wars prequels, although probably not as good as the others, they were still entertaining. But this one has the heart of the first three, action scenes that compliment the story, special effects that are jaw dropping, character development, amazing acting, and a simpler, but still complex story line. Even with all that, it's still, just as entertaining as the the other two, it completes the story of not only the prequels, but brings the saga full circle, that way we now know why episode 4 is called A New hope. If you haven't seen it because you didn't like the other two prequels, I say it's worth a watch, though some dialog is bad, it has it where it counts, the story, effects, and character.",9,4,6,30 March 2010
The Lion King," Pretty Good, but it has a few flaws.
","The Lion King seems to be the Disney animated movie that everyone absolutely loves. It is a movie that is absolutely perfect and can't be touched, there is simply nothing wrong with it. Now I actually didn't grow up with this film, I remember watching it once when I was little, and then the next time I remember seeing it was when I was seventeen. So do I like this film? Yes, I think it's a pretty damn good film, but it isn't my favorite animated movie of all time.First, the animation is absolutely beautiful. This has to be some of the best 2D animation in the history of animation. The colors are bright and vibrant, and every aspect has detail. On a technical level this film is a masterpiece. But there is more to this film that works than just animation. The characters are likable too. The relationship between Mufasa and Simba feels like a real father-son relationship, and you feel sad when Mufasa dies. The villain is great in the first half, he's so great at being bad, and he's funny too. The romance feels genuine, and some of the songs are fantastic, my personal favorite being 'I just can't Wait to be King.' Now for some downsides, despite a lot of time given to the development of Simba's father, I can't even remember his mom's name. And while Scar was great in the first half, in the last half, he sort of became just a spoiled brat, which is pretty much what Simba was in the first half, Scar just became kind of bland. And Timon and Pumbaa are half and half with me personally, sometimes their funny, sometimes their just annoying.There are a few other small nitpicks, but overall, this is a really good movie. It has great animation, great songs, a good message, and interesting characters, for the most part. And it does make me laugh at times. It may not be my favorite Disney movie, but it's still a really good film.",8,0,0,17 April 2012
Inception," Very Good
","Well here we are, this is pretty much the movie that solidified Christopher Nolan as the greatest human being on the planet since Franklin Roosevelt. And yes, I do really like Christopher Nolan, for Pete's sake he's my second favorite director, but I feel people put him on such a high pedestal. What would happen if he made a bad movie, or even a disappointing movie. But anyway on to Inception, yeah, this movie is pretty damn great.It is a movie that's hard to follow, which isn't a bad thing, but sometimes it can be annoying in how confusing it is, almost like Nolan is trying way too hard to make this as confusing as possible. Also some of the characters are forgettable. And it has a few pacing issues.But this movie has some great ideas, and they were all pulled off extremely well. It makes you think, and brings up points that you never think about. Like how you never remember how a dream starts, but always remember the middle and end. It takes full advantage of it's premise, creating so many things that can only take place in a dream. I really liked the main character, the acting was great, the effects were amazing, the score was great. It's funny at times, and well, it's just fun.Inception is easily Chrisopher Nolan's best movie since Memento, it isn't perfect, but it is pretty close. If you are one of the five people who haven't seen this movie, please go watch it. Yes, it's a great movie, but I will not join the Chruch of Nolan.",9,1,8,7 January 2011
WALL·E," One of Pixar's best
","Pixar, can you just stop making me love you. I mean, the Toy Story trilogy is one of the best trilogies ever made. The incredibles is my favorite superhero movie. Finding Nemo, Up, Monsters Inc, Ratatouille, all great. Even their lesser efforts like A bugs life and Cars seem to have at least more good than bad.Wall-e is the last robot on Earth. Meant to get clean up all the garbage we left behind as we fled to space. One day he meets EVE, a robot who was sent to Earth to find signs of plant life. She does, goes back to the spaceship, and Wall-e hitches a ride.I really loved this movie. I can't believe that two robots could have such chemistry. The animation is absolutely beautiful, easily some of the best I've ever seen. This may sound stupid, but was some of that stuff real? It also has a good message to stop being so lazy, or else you'll just get fat. Although it may hit you a little too hard over the head with it. Wall-e isn't Pixars greatest film, but's it defiantly in my personal top 5.",9,1,3,11 September 2011
The Terminal," Better than I expected.
","Now I actually didn't expect too much from this movie, I basically just got it because I am trying to catch up on my Spielberg movies. I was just hoping for a fun little movie that I could maybe get some good laughs at, but it would be much more than that. That's kind of what happened with Catch Me if You Can, another Spielberg movie starring Tom Hanks. For most of the movie it was pretty much what I expected, but in the last half-hour, it began to exceed my expectations.What didn't I like? Well basically there isn't much bad in the film, there is just very little that's great. Although I think the film's biggest flaw is the main character, Viktor did get extremely annoying at times. It was frustrating trying to get him to communicate while he was learning English. No offense to foreigners here, but this went beyond a language barrier, this was borderline Mental Retardation. It was almost as if Hanks was playing Forrest Gump again.As for the things I liked. Well of course the direction is great, as well as the acting. I officially believe that Tom Hanks is the most likable actor ever. The dumbest thing a movie could do is get him to play the villain, because it wouldn't work. ***Warning, the rest of the paragraph contains spoilers.*** But what I loved was when it seemed they were going to go for that Rom-Com third act misunderstanding. Where the woman gets mad at Viktor for not telling him he lived in a Terminal, and it seemed like she was going to leave, and they would spend the rest of the movie moping. But they didn't. After 30 seconds of anger, they talk and she forgives him. That was brilliant! Also the villain really became a complete a**hole in the end before redeeming himself. By the end I had a smile on my face.The Termianal may not be the best from Spielberg, or Hanks, or even from the two of them together (Saving Private Ryan). But it actually exceeded my expectations, enough to where I would give it a 7.5/10.",8,0,1,1 June 2012
Rango," Amazing Animation, but quite a few jokes fall flat
","Rango, starring Johnny Depp, who is probably my favorite actor, is so far the best animated film I've seen so far this year. It's simple, Rango, a chamelion actor tries to cover up the fact that he is a coward by acting tuff in front of the local town of dirt. But he must learn why the water has dried up, and also must avoid the evil Rattlesnake Jake, who will come since the only bird keeping him away has been killed.First off, the film's animation is absolutely amazing, I mean, this matches, it may even outdo Pixar's animation. ILM did this, and man, they really know how to use computers. And I also found myself laughing quite a bit during the film, including a couple of cameos from a movie I haven't seen, but get the joke.However some of the jokes fall flat, they do end up having to use a fart joke, also, it was a little predictable, but only a little bit. Overall, Rango was a great film, but I have to ask one question, this is a kid's movie right?",8,1,1,12 August 2011
Prometheus," Personally, I enjoyed it a lot.
","This movie seems to be getting pretty mixed fan response. People who like it either like it or love it, but it seems that most people on the negative side, HATE it. Now after Skyline, we went all the way through 2011 with like two really good alien movies. The two alien movie we got this year (John Carter and Battleship) were only OK, so I wanted a really good alien movie again. That's all I wanted, and you know what, I got one. Kinda.I won't spoile anything, or at least won't do it intentionally. But the big problem is that this film is much better in story and visuals than it is with characters. There are some good characters, but for the most part they were extremely forgettable. It seems to leave way too much open to just audience interpritation. Basically the writer just did something and made us figure out how the hell it works a few too many times. It doesn't focus on the alien as much as I would hope, and the alien itself, well it's a little disappointing.But the best part about this movie are the visuals. They are amazing, just the massive scope is enough to make it through the film. And a few effects even made me go, 'how the hell did they do that?' The acting is good all around, especially Micheal Fassbender as David, for like half the movie I completely forgot he was a robot. There are some interesting twists, the plot isn't anything too complex, but face it guys, neither were Alien or Aliens. The last scene actually is quite surprising, and it makes sense. Some may complain about it, but personally I found it to be cool. And it's just fun, it's got good suspense, good action, and good atmosphere.It isn't quite as good as Alien or Aliens, but watching it made me realize how much I liked those movies. The atmosphere, action, and visuals. Don't give me any bulls**t that they had deep plots, they were a haunted house in space and a shoot em up. Prometheus may not be perfect, but it's a damn fun time, with creepy scenes, great visuals, a basic but well done story, and some damn great performances.",8,1,4,22 September 2012
Back to the Future Part II," Awesome Sequel
","I know this may get a lot of flack, but I actually like this movie more than the first one. Now don't get me wrong, the first one is a BETTER FILM. It is objectively better than this movie, but man this one is just so much fun.OK, yes, some of the special effects didn't age well, and some errors between this and the first film may exist. Plus why is the daughter played by Micheal J. Fox, wouldn't it make more sense to have the actress playing Jennifer play the daughter.But man this movie is fun, it completely takes full advantage of the idea of time travel. Having alternate timelines, going both back and forward, and making the future, a future that isn't bleak and depressing. The future is just plain awesome, overblown in the way people dress, but awesome. The hoverboard chase scene in my opinion is even better than the skateboard chase in the first film. It has some pretty damn great effects for the time. I still can't believe that putting Micheal J. Fox as three people in the same shot was possible in 1989. It's still extremely funny, and I like how dark it gets in the second half.Is the first film technically better, yes it is, but I enjoy this movie more, it takes full advantage of it's time travel premise, and is just a lot of fun.",10,1,1,1 April 2010
The Woman in Black," A very creepy film
","Daniel Radcliffe's first film role after the end of Harry Potter is playing a lawyer in the early 1900s. OK, that's cool. This film is both an adaptation, and a remake, but I have neither read the book, nor saw the original film, so I went into this film with just one wish, please creep me out.And for the most part this film does that pretty well. I was creeped out throughout a lot of this film, and jumped a descent number of times. I think the reason it works so well is because it has great atmosphere, there is a twenty minute long sequence with almost no dialog with Daniel Radcliffe just walking around the house. And for a PG-13 horror movie, there are some pretty terrible ways in which KIDS, get killed. The ending has balls, it is both sad and happy at the same time. The acting is good, and it has really good production value, it really looks like the early 1900s.Now there are a few problems I had, the first twenty minutes have a few of the cheap jump scares, like a crow flying across the screen. Thankfully the scares get more real as the film goes on. There were a few times where I did feel kind of bored. And this may just be a personal problem, but Daniel Radcliffe, looks way too young to have a four year old kid. I mean he's 22, I know they had kids early back then but come on, but like I said, maybe it's just because I'm so used to him being Harry Potter.The Woman in Black is the best horror film of 2012 so far, granted the only other one I saw was the Devil Inside, but I did enjoy this film, and recommend you check it out.",7,8,14,28 February 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Really, really, good.
","Well, here we are, the release of the most hyped movie of the year arrived, and I finally saw it. Now, Batman Begins was just OK in my opinion, but The Dark Knight was a lot better. But it still wasn't perfect. Well, here we are, the final film in the trilogy, I was exited to see this, but I wasn't hyping myself up too much. I actually stayed away from all reviews before seeing it, or at least tries. I didn't check Rotten Tomatoes or Youtube, but from the reviews I couldn't avoid, I had heard it was really good. Most agree it is better than Batman Begins, but people are split on weather it is better than the Dark Knight. Well, maybe it was because I avoided the hype, but I actually liked this a little more than Dark Knight.Most of the problems I had with this movie were just nitpicking. Batman still has that voice (although it isn't quite as bad as the last film). Bane was incredibly hard to understand. It's a little confusing, and Batman, the caped crusader himself, actually isn't in the movie that often.Other than that, this movie is actually really good. It has a bit of an emotional pull to it, I actually really felt depressed at certain points. That's something that was kind of missing in the last two films. I liked the new characters, although the new police officer is a little forgettable, I liked both Bane and Catwoman. Bane may not quite be as good as the Joker, but he's still great. The Joker was threatening because it was like nothing could ever catch him. Bane is threatening because he looks like he could crush your head like a grape. Catwoman was also pretty fun, never knowing what side she was on. The action scenes are a hell of a lot of fun. Never using the up close shaky stuff, and having variety from hand to hand combat, to gun fights, to car chases. And of course, the acting, directing, cinematography, were all great. Really there isn't much wrong with the movie. It didn't blow me away like I was hoping it would, but it was still enjoyable.Did I like this movie than the other two. Yeah, I enjoyed it a little bit more than the Dark Knight for ending the series on a very good note. I'm not sure if this is better than the Avengers or not, the Avengers gave more heroes, but the Dark Knight was better written technically. I enjoyed both, I think they are both tied for my favorite movie of the year so far. Not sure if they will separated after a second viewing of each. Oh and watch out near the end for a little surprise when you find out who the detective is that we followed through some of the movie.",9,3,9,23 July 2012
Iron Man," Good, but not perfect
","Now for the past three years, I have been saying how much this film is over-rated. I saw it either late 2008, or early 2009, and eventually completely forgot about it. I couldn't remember much from the film other than a few small details. However I had only seen it once, so I decided to give it another chance to get ready for 'The Avengers.' Was Iron Man better than I remember. Yeah, but I still don't think it's perfect.My biggest problem with the film is that there's too much talking, and not enough action. This is why I'm not a big fan of superhero orgin stories, they always spend too much time setting up the story, and then the sequels cover the action. I wouldn't mind if the talking was interesting, but I really didn't care too much about the stuff they were talking about. Tony Stark is an OK character, but he does come off sort of like a douche, and sometimes was kind of annoying. He doesn't have as many funny moments as I would want him to have, which is a real shame because Robert Downey Jr. does a great job. Pepper Pots is...OK, she is a strong female lead, but at times even she is annoying. But like I said, my main problem was that there wasn't that much action.For the good stuff, the acting is great. Robert Downey Jr. owns this role. And when action does happen, it is pretty entertaining. The first fight in the cave was kind of hard to see at times, but the rest were shot really well, and kept me interested. The special effects are great, but this movie cost like $140,000,000 so that should be expected. I loved the villain, I liked his motivation, and Jeff Bridges plays it so well, adding enough comedic elements to be interesting. But my favorite character was Rhodey, just because he reminds me of myself. If I was in his situation, that is how I would react.Iron Man is a good movie. I still didn't love it like so many other people did. For me, there was too much talking and not enough action, Tony Stark came off as a little unlikable, and it's forgettable in a few places. But the action, acting, and special effects are all good, and I really liked two of the characters. So for me, it still isn't perfect, but if you think it is, that's cool.",7,0,3,11 August 2011
Toy Story 3," Pretty much Amazing in every way
","The first Toy Story is my favorite animated movie of all time, the second Toy Story is a great film, and now, Toy Story 3 has come, and even though I still like the first movie more, this film is probably the most well made of the three.Let's get the technical stuff out of the way. The animation is beautiful, easily some of the best I've ever seen. The voice acting is top notch, and the direction is great.Now for the story, Andy has grown up and is heading off for college, due to a mishap, most of the toys end up in Sunny Side daycare, and Woody is taken home by a little girl from that same Daycare. As Woody tries to get home, he learns that Sunny Side is more like a prison, as it turns out the others are being played with a bunch of toddlers who have no idea how to play with them. Now Woody, Buzz, and the rest of the gang must escape Sunny Side and get back home before Andy leaves for college.This movie made me cry, there I said it. This film came out at almost the perfect time. It came out right before I was going into my senior year of high school, so had they just waited one more year, it would've been even more perfect. But that didn't stop me from crying at the end of this movie. Basically everything that could go right with a movie, goes right here. There are a few flaws, such as a few jokes being less funny and more annoying, and yes, they actually do make a joke about crap.Pixar has made a perfect trilogy, one that ranks up there with Back to the Future, and the original Star Wars trilogy. And is even better than Lord of the Rings, and the Star Wars prequels. Thank you Pixar, I haven't seen Cars 2, but even if that movie is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life, I won't change my mind that you are the best animation company ever.",10,0,0,5 September 2011
Signs," Easily Shymalan's best film
","This is M. Night Shymalan's Masterpiece, not Unbreakable, not even the Sixth Sense, Signs is not only one of my favorite movies of all time, but in my opinion it is one of the greatest thrillers ever made.It's a little slow, that is the only thing wrong with the movie, I will be discussing why the other problems people THINK are wrong with the movie later.The following does have spoilers. The acting is great, the characters are likable, the effects are minimal but well done, the message is subtle so that people don't feel like they are being preached at and being called morons for being Atheists. It has good undertones, it's is directed extremely well, it's scary at times, and the part that makes it way better than Unbreakble, it has a sense of humor. It doesn't take itself too seriously and lets you laugh quite a bit.Now for my rant about how people call the ending to this movie stupid. The ending reveals that the alien's poison is water, so why would this advanced alien race come to a planet that would kill them? 1. We don't know for sure the aliens did know that water was harmful to them. We are only given one small hint when Ray Reddy says that none of the circles are near water. Take into account how many crop circles vs. how many crop fields there are in the world. And they knew humans would be on land, so they would want to attack away from the water, where most people would be. Plus when the water does hit the alien near the end, he seems very surprised, almost like he didn't know.2. If they did know, they were probably desperate. They wanted to heard the humans, so they would do anything to get us. Hey, I hated science, but if there is one thing I did learn, enough water can kill us too.3. Ray said they didn't have them near water, so they obviously were taking precautions. They said the aliens were leaving by the next day, so they probably didn't want to stay that long knowing the air would eventually kill them.There, three reasons why the aliens would come to a planet filled with their toxic. But what about the fact that they couldn't get through a wooden door. Well, every door we saw them try to get through was blocked by something, ever try and get inside when a door is blocked, not easy. We even see them turn the door knob, so they obviously know how to get in.Why did God have to kill Graham's wife just so they would live through the alien encounter? You ever see Run Lola Run and realize how much one little thing you do can greatly effect your future. Imagine if his wife had lived. She only said swing away because she was delirious. Plus if she was alive, maybe they would have tried to leave and been killed. Maybe Merril wouldn't have come to stay with them and thus the whole family would have died. According to this movie, God knew exactly how to make sure the family lived through the ordeal. And taking his wife was part of the plan.And lastly, why does Graham not just rush Morgan to a hospital and instead rely on faith? Well, one, sometimes logic and reasoning don't make sense and faith is all you have left. If that's not good enough for you, the hospital was quite a bit away and there were probably hundreds of people there, Morgan might not have been able to get in. Plus Graham had good reason to believe he might be alright.Signs is a masterpiece.",10,1,5,19 March 2010
Speed," One of my favorite Action Movies
","Speed is one of the greatest action movie's I've ever seen. And based on the premise it really shouldn't be, a bus, something that isn't very good in a chase, must stay above 50 miles per hour. Yet the way it's shot, the music, and making the characters likable enough to care about leads this to be one of the most heartpounding films I've ever seen. Every time I watch this film it gets me excited, and my heart begins pounding faster than usual. Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock give very good performances, the effects are fantastic, and the villain is one of the funniest I've seen in any movie.It may be cheesy, but the only thing I really don't care about in the movie is the ending. And maybe this is just me, but I think the movie actually gives you too much, by the end, it becomes just exhausting. When the train is about to derail, I'm just like 'can the movie just end.' Other than that, Speed is one of the best action films ever made as far as I'm conscerened.",10,1,3,21 December 2012
Live Free or Die Hard," Good but my least favorite
","Much like the Star Wars Prequels and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, Live Free or Die Hard, or as I'm just going to call it, Die Hard 4.0 got good reviews from critics at the time of it's release, but fans were a little more cynical. Now this is a review of the theatrical version, I'm not sure how the unrated version differs, but I would like to see it one day. Now Die Hard 4.0 is my least favorite in the series, but that doesn't mean it's bad, it just means the other three were better.I think the reason this is my least favorite is, and I know I'm going against all that I believe it, that it was made in the 2000's. One of the things I loved about the first three was that they had a certain charm that you can only get in 80's and 90's movies, like a cheesy feel. But there are a few other problems I had, the main villain was only OK, Justin Long was a bit annoying at times. Like I said, I saw the theatrical version, so maybe I'll like the unrated version more because it just doesn't seem like John McClane unless he swears more.Now while I wasn't a huge fan of the main villain, I actually really like his evil scheme. A lot of people probably hate it because it's about computers, but I actually really liked that whole aspect. Also his Asian sidekick was awesome and way more threatening than he was. It's funny, and the action scenes are really good, not up close and shaky like some other modern action movies. And I'm not sure if the effects were practical or CGI, but if they were CGI, than it was damn good CGI. And of course Mary Elizabeth Winstead was hot, and great. And John McClane hasn't lost any of his charm.Die Hard 4.0 may be my least favorite in the series, but it's still an enjoyable flick. Maybe I'll like it more if I see the unrated cut.",7,1,3,3 June 2012
Moonrise Kingdom," A great Feel-Good Movie
","I was actually really, really looking forward to this movie. Not because Wes Anderson directed it though. I know he's like a really popular director, but I haven't seen any of his movie until now. I was exited because I had heard so many great reviews, how it was the best film of 2012 so far, and...well actually that's about it. I never read why it was so good, I just sort of assumed it would make me cry. That was sort of a mistake, the film isn't one that sets out to make you cry. It actually is more of a feel good movie, and while it doesn't reach the levels of something like Forrest Gump or Slumdog Millionaire, it's still a damn good film.I think one of the main things that took me out of the story was that I just didn't feel that the two kids were really in love. The kids weren't bad actors, but their relationship just feels forced at times, I wish I had more time to know how they met and what their similar interests are. Part of me thinks that was kind of the point, that the kids aren't really in love and just want to act rebellious, but part of me also thinks it was supposed to be serious. And why does Suzy never smile, Bella Swan smiles more than her. I get that she a bit disturbed and stuff, but would it kill her to smile. Plus Anderson's directon got a little annoying at times. Not much, it certainly has a very interesting style (I'm assuming) but sometimes it got a little annoying.But while I didn't really care about the realationship as much as I wanted to, I did really like these kids. They're very likable, don't deserve some of the stuff that happens to them, or what the adults want to do to them, and were portrayed well. It's downright hilarious at times. Bill Murray has still got it, I LOL'D several times in the movie, sometimes at jokes, sometimes at the cheap special effects, or how absurd some things are. This movie gets pretty damn adult, and I know it's PG-13, but half the time it plays out like a PG or even G. There's quite a bit going on, and it doesn't feel rushed for a movie that's only an hour and a half long. And it looks very nice, I'm not going to seek out the rest of Anderson's movies, but if I catch one on TV, or find one cheap, I'll check them out.I had this movie wrong, I expected a serious drama, when it's really a coming of age film, and for what it is, it works really well. Sure the realationship feels a little forced, and it can be annoying at times. But it's hilarious, and leaves you with a good feeling. Not my favorite of the year, but pretty good.",8,1,6,5 October 2012
The Sixth Sense," Great movie
","After a student film and a made for TV film, M. Night Shymalan made his first blockbuster, the Sixth Sense. It is often regarded as one of the greatest thrillers of all time, mostly for it's creepy atmosphere, dark story, and twist ending. While I would consider this to be Shymalan second best film, it doesn't quite match Signs for me personally.It can be a bit slow at parts, almost pretentious at times. Also, I wish the film had had a bit more comic relief, I know it's a dark story, but it's so depressing that I almost hate watching it at times. Not as bad as Unbreakable but a little bit more comic relief could have helped.Yes, the twist ending is great, now the twist was actually spoiled for me before I saw the film, but what's great about this movie is that you can go back and watch it and look for clues to find out the twist ending. It's downright scary at times. The acting is fantastic, Haley Joel Osment giving one of the best young child performances in the history of film. And the direction is fantastic. The use of the color red to show when a ghost is near, the great framing of shots, everything is great. And it doesn't explain everything for you, letting you figure out some stuff for yourself.The Sixth Sense is a great movie, and easily one of Shymalan's best, it doesn't rank quite as good as Signs, but it's a damn creepy film with great direction and acting.",9,0,0,24 July 2012
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," It all Ends Here
","Plot: It all ends Here Review: Well, here we are, the end of a franchise that started a decade ago. Let's just get it out of the way, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is great. It's an emotionally satisfying conclusion that, yes, did have me on the verge of tears, I wouldn't say I cried, like in Toy Story 3, but I was close. Once again, the acting was great, I swear, someone needs to be nominated for best actor, actress, best supporting actor, something. The visual effects were incredible, they weren't shoved in your face, but when they were there they were amazing. I like the fact that the ending battle changing things up a bit so there a few elements of surprise for us who have read the books. The actions scenes are really fun to watch, and the comedy, for the most part, works really well. It also has to be one of the best theater experiences I've ever had. The exact opposite of the first one, in which the audience was annoying, this one cheered and laughed at all the right moments. And I just found myself laughing at all the screaming girls who were yelling at the top of their lungs at the Twilight trailer. However the film does have a few problems.For the most part, the problems are near the end, Voldemort sometime went so over the top that it was getting hard to take him seriously. The rest of this review will contain spoilers, so it you may want to stop reading. Then there was Voldemort's death, I didn't mind that it wasn't in the great hall (which ironically was one of my dad's main problems), but I would have preferred just getting hit with the curse and flying back, did he need to blow up (oddly, I didn't mind when Bellatrix blew up.) This truly is a movie for the fans who read the books, because there are a few points that aren't explained well, such as how Hagrid was captured, or that Lupin and Tonks had a kid. But if you have read the book then this really isn't that much of a problem.I loved the epilogue, I don't know why everyone else hated it in the book, I thought it was perfect. And it was done really well here, the final shot of Harry, Ron, and Hermione had me on the verge of tears, and that famous 'Hedwig's theme,' just added to it. Overall it is truly a great conclusion to a great series, it isn't perfect, but I give both this film, and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows as a whole, a 9.5 out of 10. I guess there is no better way to end this review than with the words my theater spoke once the credits rolled...Mischief Managed!",10,0,3,15 July 2011
Final Destination," I thought this movie would suck...I was wrong
","I'm actually a pretty big fan of the Final Destination series, I got into it after watching the third film. I actually watched this series in a weird order. I got caught up before the fifth movie came out, but I saw the others in order of 3,4,2,1. So when I finally did get around to watching the first movie, I actually thought it might suck. Because the fourth and second didn't really impress me very much. Well thankfully it just turns out that 2 and 4 weren't very good, because Final Destiantion turned out to be a pretty good movie.My biggest problem with the film would probably be the tone it goes for. Give the sequels credit, they were horror-comedy's. This film is straight up horror, sure we have Billy as the comedy relief, but for the most part this film is just a dreary dark horror film. This wouldn't be a bad thing, except that the death scenes don't match well with the tone, and it becomes a little uneven. Sure getting hit by a bus is kind of simple. But the rest are pretty over the top that it becomes kind of funny. Also I don't care much for the subplot with the FBI, I can't understand how they would think this kid would kill his friends, or how he would even do it.But the death scenes are actually pretty cool, they may not be overly complex, but they are just over the top enough to be entertaining. Most of the characters are likable, and portrayed very well by the young actors. Sure there are the characters you love to hate, but that just makes it more satisfying when they die. I laughed a descent number of times, and actually felt sad and sorry for these people. The effects are great and I love the final shot.Final Destination is a pretty good movie, it's entertaining enough, and the characters are likable. The only big problem is that the tone and death scenes don't match that well.",7,1,2,11 July 2010
The Matrix," I REALLY Liked this Movie
","I bought The Matrix out of just pure curiosity, I had heard that it was one of the best movies of all time in both effects and story. I thought, 'Yeah, it may be good, but the effects are probably outated and the story will be really hard to follow.' Not to mention, I had seen so many spoofs of this movie, especially the bullet time sequence so how could this movie live up to the ten years of hype.Well, it did, this movie was not only a smart sci-fi film, it was also a hugely entertaining film as well.It's not 100% original, OK, I get it, that's seems to be the only reason people dislike this movie.But you know what, just because it isn't one hundred percent original doesn't mean it still can't be great. I loved the plot of this film, it wasn't overly confusing, it's was smart, but easy to follow. The effects are still amazing, I love the scene where he is being shot by Mr. Smith and doges the bullets. Now I know why everyone wants to parody it, because it looks freakin awesome. The characters are likable, and there's a feeling of suspense.A lot of people hate the Matrix because it was called original. Well, no, The Matrix wasn't the most original movie of all time when it came out, and it sure isn't now, but it's still an amazing film.",10,0,1,11 July 2010
Looper," An entertaining, smart sci-fi that isn't for everyone
","(A few Spoilers Ahead) Over the past few years we have been getting some really smart science fiction movies. 2008 we got Wall-e, yes that counts, 2009 we got District 9, 2010 we got Inception, and 2011 we got Source Code. Looper made my head hurt when I saw it, and I wasn't sure if that was because I was too dumb for the movie, or too smart. I will say now that Looper is a very entertaining, smart science fiction movie that will not appeal to everyone.Here's the thing, this movie says one sentence that gives it a pass. It says that time travel is unpredictable basically, and if you can't accept that, or missed it by accident, then you will say this is one of the most plot hole filled movies ever made. Literally without that one line the entire movie is one big plot hole. Also the second act really slows down, we get a pretty generic and boring relationship between Josepsh Gordon Levitt and this farmgirl he meets. And one last big problem, some stuff happens by the most major coincidences ever. Oh, JGL just happened to land on the farm where the kid that Bruce Willis is trying kill is.The film has many twists and turns that honestly it isn't just a film you can just sit down and turn your brain off. The acting is really good, some people are mixed on if JGL looks like a younger version of Bruce Willis, personally I was able to buy it. But the biggest surprise was the little kid who gave one of the best child performances I've ever seen. There an interesting conflict going on here, and it has some cool ideas, some are pulled off better than others though. The special effects, while minimal, are very well done. And it is fun, it never gets too confusing, and has enough action and banter to keep people interested.If you can't accept that one line, and I know some people can't, than this is one of the most plot hole filled movie you will ever see. If you can accept that, then Looper is a fun, smart science fiction movie with some interesting ideas, great acting, and fun action.",8,2,5,2 January 2013
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Original, great, a classic
","Star Wars is the kind of movie that seems to never get old, it stands the test of time, the only fault I kind find with the movie is being followed by Empire Strikes Back, one of the greatest sequels ever. All the characters are well drawn out and you become attached to them.With Luke, you see a young innocent boy who wants to leave his boring life and find adventure. With Lea, you see a beautiful princess who can also kick ass. With Han, you see a sarcastic smuggler who is such unlikable man, yet you like him anyway. Darth Vader, you see a cruel, dark man who has no mercy. There are plenty of other characters, but whats the point of explaining. The effects to this day are still amazing, but they don't overshadow characters. Star Wars is a classic, if you haven't seen it yet, what's wrong with you, go see it, though it isn't the best Star Wars movie, it comes very close.",10,0,1,30 March 2010
Easy A," Emma Stone is now one of my favorite actresses
","When this movie first came out almost a year ago, I didn't think about it. I didn't plan on ever watching it, I had heard good things about it, but I just thought it was a chick flick. When in fact the movie is more of a romantic comedy, and a funny one at that, I'm still not sure if I liked this or Date Night more, but both were very good movies.The film does feel much like an 80's movie, mostly John Huges movies like Ferris Bueller, Breakfast Club, as well as others. Now I was born in the 90's, but I do have a love for 80's films, like Back to the Future, Star Wars 5 and 6, and the John Hughes movie's I've seen. And this definitely brought that same style.Emma Stone is brilliant, this is the only movie I've seen her in so far, but she is now one of my favorite actresses, that is how good she was. But for me, Amanda Bynes stole the show, I loved the Amanda Show, and she is definitely just as witty here.Well there are some jokes that fall flat, and it may seem like it's trying to hard to be like 80's high school movies than it's own movie, I still found myself loving most of it.",8,0,1,9 August 2011
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," A great movie, and one of the best sequels ever
","Yeah, if you're one of the like five people in the entire world who still hasn't bothered to watch the Star Wars Saga, then just do it, Right Now. If you only want to watch one to see if the series is as good as people say, then watch this one. It does help to watch Episode IV first, but this can be viewed on it's own.My only real problem with this movie is that it peaks way too early, my favorite part of the movie easily is the battle on Hoth, so the rest of the movie doesn't live up to the standards that the battle sets.So yes, the best part about the movie is the Hoth Battle. But one of the great parts about this movie is just how dark it gets. I don't like spoiling anything, but by the end of this movie everything has pretty much gone to hell. Yet it still manages to have a sense of humor. Darth Vader is still one of the most intiminating villains of all time, and even overshadows the emporer. The special effects are outstanding. Rarely does it ever get boring. The new characters are all interesting, and it works great as both a sequel and a stand alone movie.There are many reasons this is regarded as one of the best sequels, and science fiction movies of all time, and the fact that it is just an entertaining movie is only one of them.",10,0,1,29 March 2010
Aladdin," My Favorite of the Disney Animated Feature Films
","Of the Fifty animated films released by Walt Disney Pictures, this is my favorite. I first saw this film when the two-disc platinum edition came out, I rented it for a weekend at Blockbuster, and had you been around me around that time I would've been watching this movie, or browsing the special features.This film is so much fun, it has so much action, a lot of laughs, and tons of memorable Songs. I love this movie it's not only my favorite of the Disney animated Features, but in my top 20 favorite movies of all time.The plot is simple, Aladdin finds a lamp that holds a genie played by Robin Williams who grants him 3 wishes. One is to become a prince so he can marry Princess Jasmine. Unfortunately the evil Jafar wants the crown too, and he's willing to steal the lamp to do it.This is a great movie.",10,1,2,19 December 2010
The Cabin in the Woods," A great satire of Horror
","Well after weeks of hearing how great the Cabin in the Woods is, I finally saw it. Now I avoided pretty much anything having to do with this film. I didn't read or watch any reviews, didn't look up any details about it, and when any trailer for the movie came on TV, I turned away or changed the channel. If you haven't seen this movie yet, do not look up anything on it, this is a movie that is better when you don't know what you're getting into.Now this was directed and co-written by Drew Goddard, who also wrote one of my favorite movies, 'Cloverfield.' And while I can't say I like this as much as Cloverfield, this film was a very interesting film to see. It basically starts off as a typical horror movie, with a bunch of cliché characters. But it soon turns into something that I never would have suspected. And the characters are also really fun. Drew Goddard knows how to take cliché characters, and make them interesting. My favorite being Marty.The only problems I really had with it were that at times it was a little too dark, I couldn't tell what the hell was going on. THIS MIGHT BE A SMALL SPOILER: And the ending, it wasn't bad, but it was kind of depressing.I really don't want to get into much else, so I will just end with one small spoiler. It doesn't really ruin the plot, but I was happy when it happened.SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS: Remember Paul, that alien comedy from last year with Seth Rogan and the guys from Shaun of the Dead. I didn't like that movie, but that also had a cameo from Sigorney Weaver, unfortunately it was ruined because they let us hear her voice. This movie didn't show Weaver until the end, and it was awesome.8/10",8,1,10,20 April 2012
Slumdog Millionaire," A Phenomamanal Film
","Slumdog Millionaire, I held off from watching this for a long time, I didn't think the film was going to be that interesting, I thought it was going to be a bore, and just a pain to get through.Thank God I was wrong.This was a great film, and while it isn't my favorite movie from 2008, I do feel that it did deserve the best picture winner. Sorry fanboys, but this movie was better than the Dark Knight. The acting is great, and because they actually went to India, the production value is high. Also, I just love the way the story unfolds, by the end, my heart was pumping, wanting Dev Patel to win that million dollars.This is the last film that won best picture, in which I am actually glad it won (even if my favorite film of that year was Cloverfield). As I didn't like Hurt Locker and while I did like King's speech, I feel that it didn't deserve the Oscar.",9,2,5,17 August 2011
The Breakfast Club," I loved this movie
","If I were to tell you to think of an 80's high school movie, you would probably think of this movie. But really even if I took out the 80's part, this movie should still be the film that pops into your head. If you went to high school, then you probably know these kids. It isn't just 1985 teenagers that can relate to this, I was a high school student from 2008-2011, and I knew a each of these kids, and even related to some of them myself.OK first my negatives. The shift from comedy to drama could have been a little smoother. It just seems to go from jokes to talking about suicide. Maybe that's just me. Also the Principal was played a little to over the top. I know this is what we all thought our teachers and principles wanted to say to us, but if they really threatened me, I would be probably think it was a joke. He should have been fired.But overall this movie was really really good. If I had to pick a character I was most like it would be part of Allison and part of Brian. I was just that kid in school who was just there. I wan't a jock, geek, or criminal, I was just there. So I thought I wouldn't relate to this movie, but it turns out I did. The reason the movie works is because of it's characters, because the plot on paper sounds really boring. Really it's hard to explain why the film works so well, you just need to watch it.Sorry this review isn't that great, but really there isn't much to say, it just does a really good job of portraying teenagers. If you haven't seen it yet go watch it, especially if you're still in high school.",9,1,1,17 August 2011
Donnie Darko," Interesting ideas...but flawed
","Donnie Darko is truly an art-house movie, and art-house movies aren't really my thing. Sometimes I just really don't like them, such as 2001: A Space Oddysey, or the Tree of Life. Other times I like them, but find them so over-rated such as last year's Drive. A lot of these films have a similar problem, they are much more Style over substance, and I don't have a problem with that, I enjoyed Transformers, and Roland Emmerich is one of my favorite directors. But with these films, the style just get's boring. I don't want to watch two people sit motionless for twenty seconds, or watch crap float through space for five minutes, or cut to dinosaurs for twenty minutes for no reason. Yet Donnie Darko doesn't really have that problem.There actually is quite a bit of substance here. The film does have some really good ideas, like how Donnie's visions all come together near the end, and how he criticize therapy. And like a lot of these other art house movies, it looks great, I like how the music tells the story at times.However there are two problems I really had with this movie. One was that some of the characters, don't act like human beings. And the other was the ending. Warning, this has spoilers, so don't read on if you haven't seen the movie.I know the ending wasn't supposed to be clear. However, what I get out of this, and from what I heard, Donnie chose to die, because he knew that if he lived, a chain of events would lead to the death of his girlfriend. Uh, I don't think so, Donnie knows how she will die, he was the one who took her to the house where she was killed. So just don't take her there, you know what happens now, there is no reason to. And how does that work, will the world just go ahead 28 days, then the tornado will send everyone back who won't remember, and it will just keep repeating? Donnie Darko has some great ideas, and looks great. But some character problems and a disappointing ending lead me to like this movie less than a lot of people.",8,1,3,13 May 2012
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," It has flaws, but I still really liked it
","I don't know why the world seems to hate me. Before I saw this movie, I saw tons of reviews saying that this film was a fun, action packed movie, with great visuals, and a plot that actually wasn't that bad. I see the movie, actually really like it, then when I get home, I get on my computer, and all I can find are reviewers bashing the film. I mean seriously, spill.com gave this a low rental, two some ol' bulls**t, and a f**k you. Richard roper recently said it was the worst movie he had seen all year, despite the fact that he had given the film a D and given at least two other movies a D- and at least one film and F.I won't say the film is perfect, even though I couldn't find any, I'm sure there were at least a few plot holes. Some of the humor didn't work, and it is at least 30 minutes too long.I basically went into this movie expecting great action and effects, and I got that, but there actually were other things I liked in this movie. For example I did laugh quite a bit, some of the humor actually did work for me. And yes, I actually liked the characters. I can't say I really loved any of them, most of them are just forgettable, but Sam Witwicky I did find to be enjoyable. It's weird, I should hate him, but Shia LaBeaof takes a character I should hate and makes him likable, where were you on that one Jeremy Renner.And the plot actually isn't that bad, the last half of the movie is pretty much not stop action. And like I said, I didn't see any plot holes.There are some people who absolutely hate this movie, and to me, they either focus on one negative aspect and exploit it, like Richard Roeper. Or they can't stop living in the 80s, like Spill.com or Brad Jones. I don't really care what Spoony says because I was never really a fan of his. If you do have a strong hatred for this movie, please explain why, what makes this really worse than Season of the Witch, or Battle: LA? Overall, it is a very stupid movie, but it's a fun, very stupid movie.Whether you like them or not, I guess there are two things you can't deny about the the live action Transformers movies, one, they have incredible special effects, and two, they are very stupid.",8,11,16,5 September 2011
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," My Favorite of the Series
","Last Crusade is without a doubt my favorite of the Indiana Jones series, and I think a lot of people would agree. Sure there are some people who prefer Raiders of the Lost Ark, but this film is often regarded as one of the best sequels of all time. As it should be, it fixes most of the problems with it's predecessors, and enhances on the stuff that made that film work.There really isn't that much wrong with the movie, at it's worst moments it can be a little boring. But I also get confused as to what the movie is trying to do with with Dr. Shnieder. Spoiler Alert, but it turns out she's a Nazi, but then she's crying at the book burning, then she's clearly evil again, then she's good, then evil, by the end I wasn't sure if I was supposed to like her or not.The best part about this movie are the scenes between Indy and his dad. Harrison Ford and Sean Connery are downright hilarious at times, and have great chemistry, I actually believed that they were father and son. The action scenes are fantastic, and unlike Raiders the pacing is perfect, a perfect blend of action, comedy, drama, and adventure. Most of the special effects have held up pretty well, sure some stuff is obvious green screen but most of it's not noticeable. The villains are good, not quite as good as the ones from Raiders, but very threatening. The adventure element is great, it's sort of a mystery as well as a treasure hunt. And River Phoenix looks exactly like a young Harrison Ford.Despite not being a hardcore Indiana Jones fan, I say Last Crusade is one of the best adventure movies ever made. It's funny, exiting, has some great characters, and is very well written and directed.",9,7,10,21 December 2012
Back to the Future," Awesome movie
","Back to the Future could just be one of the most perfect movies ever made. I'm not one to bash other people's opinions, no matter how much I disagree with them, but I can't understand how you can't like this movie. Maybe think it's overrated, but if you live on this planet, you should like this movie. It isn't my favorite movie of all time, but I can find more flaws in movie's I like more than this.Really, all I can do is nitpick the movie, like how Biff is more of a serial killer than a bully, but what would be the point, it would still just be nitpicking. So yes, it does have some small flaws, but that doesn't stop the movie from being a masterpiece.OK, the good stuff now, first, there is something in this movie for everyone. It has comedy, it has romance, it has science fiction, it's a high school movie, there isn't much action, but that skateboard chase is pretty awesome. So basically if you want any of those types of movies, you will get it with this film.The characters are so much fun, and very memorable. Marty is extremely likable, Doc is hilarious, Biff is such an asshole yet you still can't help but enjoy him, Lorraine is hot, and George has some great moments. And I love the story, time travel is one of those things that has been around for years and will never get old. Everything works, and I love the little background jokes it does, like how Marty meets Doc at the Twin Pines Mall, goes back, knocks down a tree, and comes back and it's the Lone Pine Mall.The special effects are great, it's funny as hell, and it's just a lot of fun to watch. It really is one of the most perfect films ever made, the only way to criticise the film is to nitpick, and if you have to do that, then is there really any point in criticising at all?",10,1,1,1 April 2010
Jurassic Park," My favorite movie of All Time
","I'm surprised that I actually waited so long to watch this movie. I mean it came out the same year I was born, and I didn't get around to watching it till about 2006. Granted I had always seen parodies and references, but I never actually watched the film, and now it's my favorite movie of all time.That doesn't mean that this is the best movie I have ever seen in my life. This film defienently has it's faults. There are a few errors in logic, maybe a plot hole or two, some generic characters here and there, and of course the way to bring dinos back to life would never work in real life.But you know what, it seems like it could. I bet that when you first hear about this and as long as your not a scientist, you might actually believe that could happen. Yes I have read the book, and it is one of my favorite books, but I actually like the movie better. For one the book has a few dry spots, especially near the beginning, and Lex has LITERALLY NO PURPOSE. In them movie she is good with computers and is older than Tim. In the book, she is younger (more annoying) and Tim is good with computers, so she has no point in existence. Also they made Malcolm much more likable in the movie. Speaking of which, all of the characters are great, likable, and humorous. The effects are amazing, CG that still holds up and practical effects to please both sides.Really mostly every aspect of this film just works, any problems are just nitpicks. It may not be the best movie ever, but it's my personal best.",10,1,2,20 March 2010
The Wizard of Oz," One of the most likable movies ever made
","The Wizard of Oz is one of those movies that it's hard not to like, and I'm not just saying because everyone else likes it and you feel obligated to like it. It's just such a sweet and charming film, that if you do dislike it I bet you feel kind of like an asshole. So this film has definitely earned it's rebutation as a classic.However, there are a few plot holes in the story, such as why the witch doesn't just take Dorthy when she doesn't have Glinda to protect her. Or they may just drop a major part of the film. Remember the fact that Toto is bound by law to be killed at the beginning, and then it just sort of is never brought up again. And am I the only one who thinks Judy Garland is a little too old for this. She was sixteen when she filmed it, but she is playing a twelve year old, yet to me she always kind of looked like she was in her early twenties.Now let's talk about the special effects, while watching this today, I still ask how they did some of these. Yes some of them are quite obvious, but others seem like they need CGI to be able to become reality. All the characters are extremely likable, and in the middle of the film when it gets dark I honestly feel really sad for Dorthy and want her to get back home. The songs are catchy, despite a few being very similar in tune. And this film looks beautiful, I mean don't get me wrong, 'Citizen Kane' was technically a fantastic movie, but this film came out two years earlier, does some really unique stuff too and is in color, so why is this always rated lower. And it just leaves you with a good feeling, with a nice moral.While The Wizard of Oz isn't perfect, it's just such a likable movie, I can't really imagine people hating this movie. Sure it has some plot holes and some stuff doesn't make sense, but it's just a beautiful, likable, and well executed movie with great characters and songs.",9,4,5,1 September 2011
V for Vendetta," Went in expecting it to be Good, but it turned out to be great
","In the last decade, we have gotten a lot of comic book movies. Christopher Nolan's Batman movies, Spiderman, X-men, Superman Returns, and the Marvel's Avenger's series. Yet of the comic book movies that I've seen, V for Vendetta is my personal favorite. Yes, I like this movie more than The Dark Knight, more than Iron Man, even more than the Avengers. And I had never even heard of the graphic novels before, but now I kind of want to read them, and I don't even read comics.I love futures where a totalitarian government has taken over. It's a great warning that if we give too much power to our governments, then we will lose all freedom. Even though the film is set in Britian, it applies to pretty much any country with a non-communist government. It's like V said, 'People should not fear their government, government should fear their people.' The character of V is very interesting. You never see his face, so there is a bit of mystery to him, and as the story goes on we learn more about his back story. I don't know if you would call him a hero, or anti hero. He's basically a terrorist, but he's doing it for the right reasons.Natalie Portman is great, I've always liked her since Phantom Menace, and she is so hot, even when she is bald. The villain is great, the dialog works really well, and it's just a plain awesome movie. I mean they blow up important buildings while the 1812 Overture is playing. And it's really funny at parts.There are a few problems I have though. There is one part that doesn't make any sense to me, and I will have to spoil part of the movie to explain it. Who did V get to interrogate Evey. I mean he can't be that good at throwing his voice. We see hands when Evey is getting her hair cut and they weren't burnt. Plus why did he do it, he is just that heartless. And I didn't care for the flashback about Valerie, I know it gave Evey hope to get through her ordeal, but for me it just slowed things down and besides, we already knew the government imprisoned homosexuals, so why did we need to be reminded.V for Vendetta is my favorite Comic book movie, I love the plot, characters, and just find it to be a fun movie. Some things don't make sense, but it doesn't stop it from being a really good film. If you love Comic book films, check it out",10,1,3,11 September 2011
The Island," Bay's best Film
","You don't normally hear the words Micheal Bay and Box-Office Bomb in the same sentence, but it's true. This movie did not do very well at the box office, and it's a shame. The Island is Bay's best movie, at least from what I've seen (haven't seen the Rock), and definitely deserved to be a hit.OK, first the bad stuff, there are plot holes, quite a few plot holes to be exact. Normally I don't mind plot holes in an action blockbuster, but this plot needed to be smoothed over. Also the intelligence of the character's always changes. They said they are as smart as 15 year olds, but at times they talk like 4 year olds, and even sometimes like 30 year olds. And there is way too much shaky cam during the fight scenes.The main thing I like about this movie is...well...the plot. I know, it's almost like a rule that the plot has to suck in a Micheal Bay film. You can like the action and special effects, but the plot must suck. But it doesn't, I really like this idea, and it brings up some good questions. Would you kill someone if it meant that you could live longer. Some scenes get pretty hard to watch at times because you don't want to see the people killed. That doesn't mean the action and effects are bad. While the action is a too shaky, it's still entertaining. And I love the look of the future. It isn't too far fetched that a future would look like this. The cars don't hover, but they look different. They don't have super advanced technology that you would expect an alien to have. And the acting isn't half bad.The Island is an entertaining blockbuster that actually has a very interesting plot. It brings up questions without easy answers, and has some good action, effects and humor to boot. I have heard it ripped off like three other movies, but I didn't see those movies, so for me this was very original.",8,2,3,19 August 2011
