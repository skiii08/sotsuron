Miracle," Great Sports Film
","I don't know how anyone, at least here in the states, can come away from this film and not be feeling a sense of patriotism. The movie is focused around the 1980 Olympic hockey team and what they accomplished in route to the gold medal in Lake Placid. I felt the movie did a good job in presenting what most viewers of the film probably already knew going in...a team of individuals that rose to unexpected heights and pulled off a miracle victory against a superior team in the Soviet Union.I went to see this movie for numerous reasons including my enjoyment of hockey and being a Kurt Russell fan. Kurt Russell did a great job as the US hockey coach, Herb Brooks, who did whatever it took to bring a group of individuals together as one team, a team playing for the name on the front of the uniform as opposed to the name on the back. This is the kind of sports film that I will watch time and time again because it worked for me on so many different levels. The film had a few flaws here and there, but overall it is a good family film that everyone can watch, both adults and kids, and come away in a feel good mood.",8,0,0,1 March 2004
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Great Action Flick That Never Gets Old
","I have seen this movie repeatedly over the years and never grow tired of it. The movie entertains me on so many levels. The cinematography, musical score, the characters all breathe life into the movie so well. The action sequences are really exciting and Harrison Ford is at his best in bringing archeologist Indiana Jones to life. I enjoy the character so much because he does not come off as a superhero. He seems human, not invincible as some screen heroes are often portrayed coming through huge trials without a scratch. Sure Indiana Jones does some things that seem over the top or impossible, but his character isn't without flaws. He is human and gets beaten up pretty badly as he goes through numerous trials and tribulations.
The movie never fails in keeping the viewer's interest as one great action scene occurs after another. This particular movie is my favoite of all the Indiana Jones movies. I feel the movie holds up very well even after all these years. The film does not feel dated at all. The movie launched quite a few ripoffs during the early 80s, none which ever stood up to the success or greatness of this one. Many tried, but very few succeeded. This movie will always go down as one of my all time favorite movies.",9,0,0,22 February 2004
The Rookie," A Good, Clean Family Film
","I saw this recently in the theaters. The main draw for me was the theme of baseball, but their was much more to the movie. The Rookie tells the story of a high school teacher, Jim Morris, who pursues his dream after the baseball team he coaches issues him with a challenge to try out for a major league team if they win their division title. Dennis Quaid did a wonderful job as Jim Morris.  He really breathed life into the role. The story was very good in showing the theme of making choices and how those choices affect our lives and the individuals around us. A particularly memorable scene is when his wife first learns of his attempts to get back into baseball. You would expect his wife to initially be supportive of him because it is something he really wants to do, but there is an expression of mixed emotions as she honestly expresses her real feelings on his attempt at trying to get into the majors in his late thirties. She isn't particularly supportive and prefers he not do it in the beginning. The film will leave you with a 'feel good' attitude after you watch it, and you do not necessarily have to enjoy baseball to enjoy the film. Whether you see it in theaters or wait until home video please make sure you make an effort to see this film.",8,1,1,3 May 2002
Spider-Man," Greatest Comic Book Adaptation since Superman: The Movie
","It has been a long time since I went to the movies to watch a comic book adaptation and come away so completely and utterly satisfied. I drove 65 miles to an AMC Theatre in Overland Park because the theaters in Topeka are relics that should be condemned. It was worth the trip out there!!Sam Raimi hit a bull's-eye with Spiderman sticking closely to the comic book's central theme. He also succeeds in having a good balance between the drama and the humor in the film as well as presenting a lot of storyline detail in a movie that is just over 2 hours long. I have quickly become a huge fan of his over the last few years, and after seeing Spiderman, I enjoy his work even more than before. There are some minor problems and changes with Spiderman compared to the comic book, but they are just that...minor.
Tobey Maguire made a believer out of me as Peter Parker. I was quite skeptical when I first heard the announcement he was going to play this role. He turned out to be a great pick proving me wrong. I felt he did a good job carrying out the transformation his character goes through from high school nerd to an individual presented with great gifts who, through various trials and tribulations, quickly learns that with great power comes great responsibility.  Willem Dafoe pulled off Norman Osborne beyond my expectations playing him and his evil alter ego, The Green Goblin, with diabolical delight. I liked the fact that the director allowed the movie to be dark in tone when it needed to be and also to be violent in its portrayal of The Green Goblin as he wreaks havoc and carnage towards his enemies and in the finale as he meets his demise.The movie doesn't necessarily have an upbeat ending, but rather nicely sets up for the upcoming sequel. It showed the viewer that the abilities Peter Parker now possesses are not just a gift, but are also a curse because of occurrences that took place due partly in fact to his being Spiderman. For example, the events that took place with Mary Jane and his Aunt Mae. When his enemy learned who the man behind the mask really was, those closest to him were tormented. There is also great tragedy in the fact that Peter Parker is between a rock and a hard place as his alter ego, Spiderman, when it comes to his best friend Harry Osborne. As the movie winds down, Harry has animosity and bitterness toward Spiderman because he thinks he murdered his father, but at the same time considers Peter Parker the only real family he has left.It was also very cool to see Bruce Campbell have a cameo as the ring announcer during the wrestling scene. Although brief, it is a memorable scene for Bruce Campbell fans. I will definitely see this one again. Just a wonderful 2 hours of movie making that gives me hope knowing there are still moviemakers out there that know how to bring superhero flicks to the big screen with major success. This movie was meant to do nothing more than entertain its audience and it goes above and beyond that. Go and watch Spiderman today!!!9/10",9,0,0,5 May 2002
Jaws," It's a Carcharodon carchariasÂ…a great white
","No need to bore the reader with the plot details because anyone who is the least bit familiar with this film knows what it is about. Jaws is one of those movies I never get tired of. It is still as entertaining and suspenseful now as it was when I first saw it on the big screen in the 70s. Spielberg does a wonderful job in not showing the actual shark until the latter part of the film. It really helps to build the suspense, leaving it up to the viewer's imagination as to what Amity and its people are really up against.  A masterful musical score by John Williams helps to move this along wonderfully. The score really breathes life in to the movie. The music is so recognizable today that most die-hards of the cinema are instantaneously familiar with it.  Jaws is similar to his previous film, Duel, about strife between man and leviathan, the leviathan being a truck and its faceless driver. In Jaws the leviathan is a great white.
I feel the movie does a splendid job in showing the emotional strife that Chief Brody undergoes as the movie progresses. As the film opens, he is a sheriff who is quite happy doing his job on Amity without any real problems compared to what he once faced in his job prior to living on Amity. Then he transforms into a man under a great deal of pressure and anxiety as he encounters a problem bigger than anything he ever faced before.
Numerous films were compared to Jaws throughout the 70s and early 80s.  It was a huge phenomenon when it came out launching a plethora of rip-offs, some good, some horrible. The movie has great dialogue, editing, music and characters that help to make this one of the classic films from the 1970s. Robert Shaw's role as Quint is one for the ages. He really brought his character to life with a memorable performance worthy of an Oscar.
For me, the best part of the film is when Brody, Hooper and Quint head out to sea to capture and/or kill the Great White. So many wonderful moments in the last part of the film that bring out a wide variety of emotions including laughter, tension, anxiety, sorrow and finally a sense of relief when the shark is killed. I have a friend that feels there are a lot of correlations between Jaws and Moby Dick. Bruce the Shark is to Quint what Moby Dick was to Captain Ahab. It's up to the viewer to believe whether this is the case or not. And finally, for what it's worth, all the dress jackets that Murray Hamilton (Mayor Larry Vaughn) wears in the film, including the one with the little anchors, are some of the worst I've seen in movies to date.",9,1,3,31 March 2002
