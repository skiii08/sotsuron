The Blair Witch Project," Slick, decent little thriller, with very good aspects
","A decent little earner grossing over 240million dollars from just 20 odd thousand dollars invested. It twists and turns with suspense built up throughout. You feel little sympathy towards the characters plight however as they seem to create their own demise. For example Mike throws the map into the river, Heather gets them lost constantly, and they don't even follow basic survival techniques despite the book Heather brought with her which must have included sections on compass readings and possible reasons for it leading them in a circle. It would have said follow the river!! Leads away from the source which is in the Forest! Obvious!! Despite the above let downs, this film has got some serious good points. As a horror fan i like to see a good plot, a decent believable cast and a solid scare. This film delivers an original plot that has intrigue surrounding it from the get go. The cast are very believable as you see their true reactions, partly due to the filming and production techniques of withholding food etc!! And lastly this has the scare is amazing. You never see the force behind the scariness. You never see the people behind the children's voices. You never even see the witch or anything!! A great idea.I would recommend this film to all newcomers. When you see this film you will find yourself waiting until the end of the credits to see if it actually was true as it looks so real. To this day people still believe this film is real!! It isn't people but hey amazing as it is!! Slick and cool, very decent addition to a horror collection.",7,0,2,31 October 2005
Wedding Crashers," Unbelievably funny
","What a funny film. It had it all and i found it great. The cast works perfectly and with a lot (and i mean a lot) of laughs scattered through a gloriously original plot.It has it all and the actors do so well with each other. With so much comedy the film surely had to have its downside?? Nope it was all there from start to a very cool finish. Not giving it away but the church scene is fantastic!! a must see for all comedy fans, and also for grumpy sods who need a laugh. Oh and the grandmother is sooooooo funny!!I have said that this film is funny, and that does not do the film any justice at all. I marvel at its ingenious original plot and how the film makers have played it our. The characters are great and the ending gives all the just deserts you want without being crazy. I found the whole film to be amazing and i will buy and watch it over and over again.I you like comedy you'll love this film!! A must see for 2005. Best film ever!!",10,1,3,5 September 2005
