Sucker Punch," Modern Military Mayhem Madness
","Sucker Punch 2011... A cinematic EMO GOTH mind trip starring barely legal, scantily dressed, machine gun wielding psycho orphan strippers, warding off several barrages of mecha medieval samurai priest nazi zombie pimp doctor gangster robots and a dragon... in semi slow motion 3D CGI... Basically everything a 21st Century gamer skater surfer extreme super cool mega chilling teenager needs in a $150 Million waste of film... But it's all in the sad girl's crazy 'lil head!!! Enjoy lining some already rich people's pockets if you can't just find a decent download... I still give it 7/10 for visual and musical triumphant extremities... The film's score is a modern cover collage of classic rock's top choice psychedelic hits... PAY TO SEE THIS IN A THEATER!!!!! Or wait to watch it on your gigantic HDTV at home by the time it reaches your kids' PlayStation this summer... That's if they aren't too busy earning head shots via some popular war simulation game which will certainly fail them when they are shipped off to fight the next unsanctioned war in a sandy oil rich nation thousands of miles from wherever it is you are from... Don't vote for Hillary Clinton EVER or we will all too soon surely DIE!!! But the movie is good...",Null,1,4,29 March 2011
