The Ring," Excellent Thriller
",The movie starts off looking like a teen based thriller (The girls in the bedroom at a sleep over - You know someone is going to die a bloody death!!!) but it quickly changes gears as the story unfolds into a chilling thriller.I found the move to be very suspenseful and entertaining.,9,0,0,13 November 2002
