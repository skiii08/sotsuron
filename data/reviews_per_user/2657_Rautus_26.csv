Alien 3," Just has good as the previous two
","Alien 3 is a great sequel to Ridely Scott's original sci-fi horror classic Alien. Alien 3 has a dark tone to it which I like about it, it also returns to having one Alien instead of loads like James Cameron's sequel Aliens which is also a great movie. The film has some great gore scenes and suspense scenes, the acting is great and the Alien effects are good and scary, the visual effects are a bit dated. Alien 3 had some different plot ideas before using the plot they did, one plot for Alien 3 had Ripley crash land on a monastery planet where a group of monks thought the was living in a post-apocalyptic dark age and lived a middle-ages style life and don't use technology. After Ripley and the Alien crash land on their planet they would blame the attacks on Ripley and lock her up, in the meantime she finds herself dreaming of a human-Alien hybrid. The idea was changed to have the monks replaced by prisoners and the wooded planet to a prison planet.The film begins right after Aliens and sees the ship catching on fire after an electrically malfunction. The ship detaches and the escape pod crashes onto a prison planet, Newt and Hicks are killed in the crash while Bishop is damaged. Ripley is the only survivor, after waking up she discovers what happened and checks the escape ship to see an acid burn on one of the tubes, she asks the doctor to do an autopsy on Newt to find that there is nothing inside her chest. The bodies of Hicks and Newt are cremated, meanwhile the dog of one of the prisoners was impregnated by a Facehugger and the ChestBuster bursts out. The new Dog-Alien hides away until it's full grown and soon the nightmare begins again as it begins to attack the prisoners, Ripley finds Bishop and reactivates him to ask what happened on the ship. Bishop tells her that an Alien was on the ship, Ripley and the prisoners have to stick together and try and stop the Alien before it kills everyone of them but Ripley discovers something else, she has an Alien inside her. The Facehugger got her while she was in hyper sleep and the Embryo inside her is a Queen. Now she has to stop the Alien before killing herself to stop the Queen from bursting out and the whole process starts all over again.Alien 3 is a great sequel that should be seen.

The Terminator," Classic 80's sci-fi action movie
","The Terminator is one of those low budget 80's action movies that is great fun to watch, James Cameron had an interesting idea about the future with machines taking over the world and mankind is fighting them in a war zone. The music has a 80's feel to it which I love, the gun sound effects are also cool and the acting is great, Arnold Schwarzenegger did a great performance as a machine since he shows no emotion, uses guns with great skill, and talks in a way like a machine would. He also says the famous line 'I'll be back.' Micheal Biehn plays Kyle Reese, a solider that has no choice but to fight The Terminator and he does a great job, Linda Hamilton does a great job as Sarah Conner, a women that lives a ordinary life but soon finds herself being hunted down by a unstoppable killing machine and her only help is the solider from the future sent to protect her, she has to become strong and get rid of her fear, in Terminator 2 she shows us that.The film sees a war in the future were humans and machines are fighting each other, a company called SkyNet created the machines but they rebelled against the people who made them and destroyed everything. Some humans survived and decided to take on the machines, one man named John Connor lead the humans against the machines so as a result they sent one of their machines to kill the mother Sarah Connor so that John never exists and they will win, but John sends one of his men Kyle Reese to protect Sarah and stop The Termiantor so that John will be born and Tech Com will battle against the machines.The Terminator is a classic 80's sci-fi movie that should be seen. 10/10",10,0,1,1 August 2007
Cloverfield," A Great modern Monster Movie
","There has been some really great classic monster movies like King Kong and Gojira, Cloverfield is actually a pretty great modern Monster movie. At first I wasn't sure about this film, the trailer looked interesting but sometimes the trailer can make the film look better than the actual film, so me and a few friends went to the cinemas to check it out and see what it was like. When Cloverfield started I still wasn't sure if this was going to be a good film, I thought the shaky camera was going to get annoying. Once the action started to get going the movie started to become really good, I liked the way they made the Creature so mysterious and gradually let you see more of it has the movie progressed. The camera could get a little tedious at times and could make the movie a little confusing because you can't see what's going on clearly but it didn't spoil the movie too much for me. The Creature itself was kind of cool, it's a giant monster but it can also produce these little creatures. Cloverfield does have some great atmospheric scenes like in the subway and the building, the way it's just filmed with an ordinary camera makes it more creepy. Cloverfield doesn't really explain the origins of the Monster but I guess they left that window open for the viewers imagination, the ending was little bit of a disappointment. We was expecting a little bit more, a few other people in the cinemas even stated that as they walked out at the end. Cloverfield did have some good effects like with the Monster and the little creatures, the destroyed city and the statute of liberty head.The film sees a group of people throwing a party for a friend who's going to Japan, suddenly after a while they experience something like an earthquake. They quickly leave the apartments and find a huge explosion happen in the city then the head of the Statue of Liberty flying over and landing near them, soon they go through the city and discover that a huge Monster is attacking Manhatten. Instead of following the other survivors the main four go off to help their friend who's stuck in her apartment, as they go on they get caught up in a battle with the army and the Monster, they hide out in the subway and decide to go through the tunnel where they soon get attacked by these creatures that drop off the giant Monster. They escape from the Creatures and hide in one of the rooms, they decide to leave and continue going but soon meet the army who take them to a temporary base. They discover that one of them was bitten by the creatures and is taken away and the mysterious infection kills her, the others are told that an evacuation chopper is going to pick up the survivors at 6 o'clock, they then decide to find their friend and try and make their way to the evacuation point. But the Monster is destroying the city and it's only a matter of time before it runs into their way and gets them.Cloverfield is a great modern take on the Monster movie genre that tries to do something new and original. The shaky camera may make some people feel a bit queasy but the film itself is a great Monster movie that should be seen. Check this out. 10/10",10,0,2,2 February 2008
Pan's Labyrinth," Guillermo del Toro's masterpiece
","El Laberinto del Fauno (The Labyrinth of the Faun) or Pan's Laybrinth as it's also known as is a great movie, it's a wonderful work of art created by Guillermo del Toro who also directed great films like Mimic, Blade II, Hellboy. The fantasy parts are amazing, the way the fantasy world and real world elements contrast makes this film unique. We see a nice, imaginative fable like world then we see a dark, violent real world. The way they contrast is pulled off impressively, Doug Jones who played Abe in Hellboy gets in creature make up again this time playing the Faun and the Pale Man. El Laberinto del Fauno, Pan's Labyrinth is also unique because it's an adult fantasy film, it's got violence, swearing and gore. I think that's what makes it so appealing because it's something different.El Laberinto del Fauno, Pan's Labyrinth is a masterpiece by Guillermo del Toro that should be seen.

Alien," Sir Ridley Scott's classic sci-fi horror
","This is one of the best sci-fi horror movies I've seen (Predator, The Thing are also two of the best I've seen), the atmosphere of the ship is just brilliant and scary when the Alien is creeping about. The air duct scene is very tense and creepy. Sir Ridley Scott directing is great and gives out some really fantastic suspense scenes. The acting is great, this is the first time we Sigourney Weaver as one of her most famous roles: Ellen Ripley. The plot of the film sees a cargo ship returning to Earth, the crew members wake up from their hyper-sleep and can't wait to go home. While flying through space they pick up a distress signal from a near by planet so they decide to land, the ship gets damaged and they're stuck on the planet, some of the crew decide to check the planet out for anything and soon come across a huge spaceship in the distance, they enter and soon discover a huge skeleton of an Alien life form in the ship with a hole in it's chest, they search deeper into the ship and Kane falls down the hole, in the hole he discovers a room full of Pods, he inspects one of them and it opens then a spider like creature called a Facehugger jumps out and attachés to his face, melting through his helmet. They return to the ship with Kane but Ripley can't allow Kane into the ship because of Quarantine but Ash lets them in. In the medical room they study the Facehugger and learn that it's keeping Kane alive like a host, they try to get it off but it's grip tightens. They then go and try to cuts it's legs off but it's blood spill and melts through the floor since it's blood is acid. After a while they see that the Facehugger as came off Kane, the Facehugger itself is dead. Kane wakes up and they go to have dinner but during it Kane starts to act strange and soon falls on the table then suddenly something bursts through his chest. The Chestbuster then runs off and after a while they go looking for it.

Ripley checks the ships computer and discovers that the company wanted the Alien life form on the chip for their Bio weapons programme and the crew are expendable. Ripley sees Ash next to her and soon he attacks her, the others hurry in and help Ripley and they discover they Ash is a Droid sent by the company to retrieve the Alien, after destroying him they decide that the only way to stop the Alien is to destroy the ship and escaping from the small ship. Getting the air supplies while Ripley goes to the ship they are attacked and killed by the Alien leaving Ripley on her own with it, taking the Flamethrower she goes to self-destruct the ship and on her way out she encounters the Alien and runs.

Predator," A fantastic action/ sci-fi horror movie
","Predator has to be one of my favourite movies since it has action, gore, great acting, a great music score and one of the coolest creatures in history. The Predator looks so cool with the weapons, mask, the roar, the dreadlocks, the face and the characteristics created by Kevin Peter Hall. The plot sees a crack team of commandos sent to the jungles of South America to rescue some hostages and once they get there they discover that it was a cover up, they was just sent there to stop a major invasion. As they try to get to the pick up point they find themselves being hunted by the Predator that is blending itself with the jungle. I won't give out too much of the film otherwise it will spoil it.Predator is a classic 80's action/ sci horror movie that has to be seen. 10/10",10,2,4,2 July 2007
The Thing," John Carpenter's sci-fi horror masterpiece
","This movie is one of the greatest and scariest sci-fi movies I've seen, it still creeps me out now when I watch it and that's another reason why I love it. John Carpenter's The Thing is a remake of Howard Hawk's The Thing From Another World made in 1951. The film is scary because they're trapped inside with each other and one of them is The Thing and they can't stay outside because they'll freeze. The paranoia is great between the characters as they start to distrust each other thinking one of them could be it. The music score is another thing why I enjoy this movie because it's so creepy and makes this film more scary, The Thing effects are brilliant and really impressive since all of it is hand made since CGI wasn't made then. The effects are also really gory and disturbing like when Blair does an autopsy on the body of The Thing. John Carpenter's The Thing is a fantastic sci-fi horror movie that is still really scary and should be seen. 10/10",10,1,2,21 July 2007
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," One of the best sequels ever made
","Terminator 2: Judgment Day Directed by: James Cameron Written by: James Cameron & William Wisher JrReview: The Terminator, one of the most memorable sci-fi masterpieces ever made.Terminator 2: Judgment Day, one of the memorable sequels ever made and like it's predecessor it's a sci-fi masterpiece.With a higher budget and with more special effects Writer/Director James Cameron took his low budget sci-fi classic and turned it into a big budget Hollywood blockbuster with his 1991 box office smash sequel Terminator 2: Judgment Day.The film features some of the best special effects for the 90's and I must say even though CGI has been improved the effects in this movie still look impressive just like with James Cameron's other movie The Abyss.The music in this movie is truly beautiful, it's compelling, saddening and exciting. The final scene of the movie is a great example of how powerful the soundtrack for this movie really is. The acting is alright, Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job as the New Terminator unit, Linda Hamilton does a good performance as Sarah Connor. It's interesting to see how different her character has become over the years. Edward Ferlong is alright has John Connor and Robert Patrick is definitely convincing as the deadly T-1000.The action is entertaining and will satisfy any violence lover. Plot:11 years after the events of The Terminator, SkyNet send a newer and more dangerous Terminator into the Past, this time to murder the leader of the human resistance, John Connor while he's still a child. The Human Resistance fight back by sending their own Soldier back in time to protect the young John Connor, however this time it's not a human but another Terminator. After escaping from the T-1000, the T-101 and John Connor set off to rescue his mother Sarah who's being held in a mental hospital before the T-1000 shows up, kills her and copies her form. Showing up the T-101 and John Connor find Sarah and quickly escape as the T-1000 pursues after them. Hiding out somewhere Sarah Connor discovers who created the SkyNet Super Computer and sets off to kill him and change history. The T-101 and John Connor arrive at the house and find Sarah, Miles and his family. Telling him about what will happen if he creates the SkyNet Computer he decides to help them get the Arm and Chip from the previous T-101 unit and dispose of them thus preventing the War between Man and Machine.Overall:Terminator 2: Judgment Day is a great sequel that should be seen and just like The Godfather Part II and Aliens it's a prime example of how to make a great sequel.Check this film out. 10/10",10,6,8,30 March 2009
Spider-Man," One of the best comic book adaptations
","Spider-Man is one of the popular comic book heroes and the film portraits it perfectly. Directed by Sam Raimi who did Evil Dead and Darkman Spider-Man has some good acting and FX. The Green Goblin's suit was high tech looking from the animated series.The plot followed the comic's storyline and is very close at times, Spider-Man's beginning was like that of the comic. Sam Raimi really did a good job on the film.The FX was good with the several CGI scenes that captured the web slinging nicely. The acting was good from everyone, Tobe had sensitive and heroic quality.If you're a fan of the comic of superhero type films then check Spider-Man out. I also recommend: Spawn, X-Men, Daredevil and The Punisher (Both versions)",10,0,2,25 March 2007
Aliens," A great sequel to a sci-fi horror classic
","Aliens is the sequel to the 1979 sci-fi horror classic Alien directed by Ridley Scott, Aliens gives us something different which is sci-fi action combined with horror. Aliens is my favourite out the series because it's such a great sequel and instead of copying the first film we get a completely different style. The acting is great, the film has a great pace of action and horror, the Aliens look scary especially the Alien Queen.After the events of ALIEN Ripley when into hyper sleep and her ship floated through space and now it's been picked by a salvage crew who find Ripley alive in her cryotube so they take to the ship run by the company and once she recovers she's told that she's been floating through space for years, she soon gives her story of what happened to the company but of course they don't believe her so her license is taken from her but she then learns that the planet was made livable and a colony is there, Ripley is then told a while later that they've lost contact with the people on the planet and they need her to go there since she's encountered the Aliens before, at first she refuses but then she thinks about and offers to go if they're there just to eliminate them not to capture and study.While they wait to reach the planet Ripley meets some of the Marines, and while having dinner Bishop does his famous knife trick but cuts his finger where Ripley sees the white android blood and asks Burke why a android is with them but the Marines always send a android on a mission but Ripley doesn't like him since Ash malfunctioned and tried to kill her and was working under company orders. Soon they land on the planet and the Marines go in, all they find is acid burns. No humans no Aliens just what happened, soon they find movement but discover that it's a little called who calls herself Newt, Ripley makes friends with her. The Marines soon discover movement in a part of the complex so they go down in there while Ripley, Bishop, Newt and Gorman observe in the vehicle, soon the Marines find the bodies of the colonists cocooned to the walls, they find one still alive but soon the Chestbuster bursts out and they burn it but this alerts the Aliens and soon a huge firefight breaks out with most of the Marines getting killed by them.Gorman starts to crack under the pressure so Ripley takes the wheel and drives to where they are, Hicks, Hudson and Vasquez manage to get into the vehicle and then Ripley quickly drives off while some of the Aliens still attack, Ripley manages to escape but Gorman gets injured so someone else needs to lead them and that's Hicks. They're only option is to destroy the planet but Burke doesn't want this but they still do it, the ship to pick them up gets destroyed when an Alien sneaks on board and kills the people in it, now they're stuck on the planet with just a few hours before it explodes. They barricade themselves inside the place and put a few sentry guns around, Bishop comes up with plan to remote control the pick up ship on the Marines ship so he goes through the tunnels to connect the remote link up while the others try to stop the Aliens from getting in, Ripley takes Newt to bed and promises that she'll protect her then she meets with Hicks who teaches her how to use their weapons, she then goes with Newt to get some sleep and when she wakes up she finds her Pulse Rifle gone and two containers with the Facehuggers in open, another problem is that the door is locked and soon her and Newt try to stop the two Facehuggers.Ripley takes out her lighter and triggers the fire alarm alerting the Marines so they quickly jump to action and rescue Newt and Ripley also killing the two Facehuggers. Ripley tells them that Burke was going to impregnate her and Newt so that the Company would have the two Aliens, he would also sabotage the Mariens cryotubes. Then suddenly the power goes out and they barricade the doors where the Aliens could come from but soon as they get even closer Hicks checks the ceiling to discover loads of them climbing about then suddenly a huge firefight begins as the try to hold off the Aliens, Burke runs off and locks the door, Hudson shoots at them but the floor underneath is broken by the Aliens and he's pulled down. While they try to open the door Burke locks another and opens to next to find an Alien in the next room and it kills him. They then go through the vents as the Aliens start to break down the other door. As they're moving along Vasquez gets attacked by an Alien and although she kills it she gets badly burnt so Gorman goes to help but they get surrounded by the Aliens so they blow themselves and the Aliens up with a grenade. Meanwhile Newt gets captured by the Aliens and it's up to Ripley to try and save her before she becomes a host.Aliens is a great sequel and a sci-fi classic made by legendary director James Cameron.

Evil Dead," Evil Dead - An interesting re-imagining
","The Evil Dead, of course, needs no introduction. It was a infamous horror movie that sparked much controversy for its outlandish violence and gore. And not forgetting the famous tree rape scene which gained much attention.The movie gained cult status during the Video Revolution, even receiving the honour of becoming a 'Video-Nasty' in the UK. Its low budget style, charming simplistic story, absurd gore, camp tone, not to mention publicity helped make it a horror classic that spawned two equally excellent sequels It also featured a young, then-unknown Bruce Campbell who would later go down in history as one of the best B-Movie actors of all time.So, it's no wonder why Fans were in such outrage and panic when they heard the terrifying news of a remake.Good news, The Evil Dead fans should fear not for as remakes of classic horror movies go, Evil Dead is actually very good. It's a refreshing, unique re-imagining of the groovy little gem.A more serious, darker toned film, that still keeps the over the top, ludicrous gore from the original. The serious tone helps create a more intense atmosphere. No fun goofy Evil Dead II goodness or the camp tone of the original here.The style of the film is very moody and very grim, creating a uneasy tension before the nightmare has even begun. The characters have a decent amount of depth, that little extra more than the original, but in movies like this, character is the last thing on many of the viewers minds.A genius move was the new characters, a perfect way to explore the new story without being bound to the original and no fear of annoying fans if there's a certain difference to their personality or a change in their fateI'm sure fans would have been outraged if the iconic Ash was portrayed in a different light and met a different fateNot to mention fans would always compare the new actors performance to the legendary Bruce CampbellSo it's a good thing they created new protagonists, no need to walk in its predecessors shadow in that light.That said, the movie tends to be held back at times, unable to reach brave new territory by the fact that it's a remake. It could have explored more back story of the Book of the Dead, explained its new origin, the new lore. Keep the basic premise but break away more from the traditions, did new, exciting things. Have more grotesque, imaginative scenes with the Deadites, push the boundaries of horror. It's 2013, they could have shown the most sickening, spine tingling, frightening things these monsters are capable of. The grisly end of the creatures could have spun heads. However, there are some very disturbing scenes that made me and many others in the audience cringe but they were no different from the dismemberment you'd see in the every day average torture porn movie or slasher.One thing that made the original so refreshing was it's bizarre gore sequences, that back then seemed so revolutionary. There weren't many horror movies where you witnesses a brutal slaying by an axe, or hand mutilation, or even impalement that resulted in Alien- Esq milk spurting.The remakes gore could have raised the bar for the generation of today like the first did for the generation of yesterday.A concept I found rather interesting was the main character Mia who is trying hard to go cold turkey in a desperate attempt to kick her drug addiction. A fresh take on the cliché: lets go to the deserted house or cabin in the woods, have a few beers, get laid and get killed by the madman, monster scenario that has been done to death, a cliché that was spoofed perfectly in 2011's The Cabin in the Woods.It added a new layer of depth for the characters, a drama that sadly never reaches its full potential, but what is shown is enough for this kind of movie.A daring and interesting direction the director should have went with was a psychological one, have a film that played on the idea of her withdrawal symptoms, made a story that toyed with the audience, made you wonder if the things she was seeing was really happening or all a delusion in her head.Have her fight her own personal demons, make the Deadites a representation of her struggles.Even be so daring to have had a twist where it all as a dream in the end, or to play it a little more safe, in a triumphant spiritual conclusion, shown that it was all real and that by conquering the Deadites, Mia had conquered her addiction.All interesting possibilities that are unfortunately never utilised. Once the madness of The Evil Dead begins, it enters demon slaying territory and stays firmly dug in there until the very end.The psychological aspects from the original is lacking here in the remake in favour for ultra violence and while that is a disappointment, lovers of gore SFX and buckets of fake blood will have a field day at the sinister delights that await them. The prosthetic effects are a nice change from the lazy, unconvincing CGI blood and gore that dominates practically all modern day movies.At the end, I found it leaving me feeling like they could have done a little more. All in all, it's a dark, trashy, over the top, ultra violent horror movie that is certainly not for the faint of heart.It's definitely worth checking out. For Evil Dead fans and gore hounds alike.",7,2,12,24 April 2013
The Evil Dead," A great gory movie
","The Evil Dead is a great horror film made by Spider-Man director Sam Raimi with a very small budget by he made a film with some really great gore that would start the whole Video Nasty films like Zombie Flesh Eaters (Zombi 2) and The Driller Killer.The tree rape scene was kind of interesting, not many films show a woman being raped by tree branches. The acting is good for a low budget horror film, Bruce is a really good actor.The Deadite makeup is good and creepy and the gore is great to watch, when Scott cuts up the Deadite Shelly that was gory or when she bites her hand off.A classic horror film that is full on gore. 10/10",10,1,3,24 February 2007

Psycho," A horror classic
","I don't usually watch black and white movies but since I bought the box set I thought give it a try and I really did enjoy it. Psycho is a great horror movie that's full of suspense and thrills, the acting in this film is great especially from Antony Perkins and Janet Leigh, Antony does a great performance as Norman Bates. That role was one of his best since he shows who a young man who you wouldn't think is a killer would do all that but it's not his fault, his tormented because of his Mother and that's why he does it but there is a deeper reason because of this.The music is score is also effective with the suspense and then the classic music score when Norman attacks like the shower scene, Alfred Hitchcock really did a good job on this film. Psycho is a classic horror film that should be seen. 10/10",10,0,1,17 October 2007
Army of Darkness," Evil Dead 3: Army of Darkness
","Army of Darkness is a action/ adventure film instead of a horror film but that's okay. This film is still good.Ash is sent to the medieval times and must retrieve the Book of the Dead for them so he can be returned home but he forgets the words before taking the book and causes the Army of Darkness to rise and Evil Ash who he encounters before taking the Book.Ash then must protect the castle with the knights to hold of the Army and stop Evil Ah from getting that Book.The gore from the previous movies is gone in this one although there is a few bloody moments, the humour in this film is great.This is good sequel to the Evil Dead Trilogy.",10,10,12,24 February 2007
Prometheus," Prometheus - Flawed but Enjoyable
","Prometheus (2012) Directed by: Ridley Scott Screenplay by: Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof Prologue: Prometheus, the long awaited instalment in the Alien Saga is finally here, and like everyone, I was excited to go see it After all, this was a new Alien movie that was being directed by Ridley Scott, the visionary genius behind the 1979 classic that started it all, not only that but it was to be a Prequel that expands the Alien Universe and sheds light on the long, mysterious Mythology behind the Space Jockies and Prometheus would also return the series to its roots with the dark, Gothic H.R. Giger style surroundings I couldn't wait.Plot: In the year 2089, an archaeologist couple Elizabeth Shaw and Charlie Holloway discover a star map hidden among the remnants of other unconnected ancient cultures. Believing all this to be connected to the human race's creators. Peter Weyland, the founder of the powerful Weyland Corporation, funds the creation of the scientific vessel named after the Greek Titan Prometheus to follow the star map to the moon LV-223 to find mankind's makers, dubbed 'Engineers' by Shaw.In the year 2093, the ship arrives and lands near an alien structure. A team including Shaw, Holloway, and David explores the structure, while Vickers and Captain Janek monitor their progress on-board the ship.What was meant to be the scientific discovery of a lifetime, soon becomes a nightmare of complete terror as the intentions of the structure and of the Gods who made us becomes clear.Review: Prometheus is interesting movie with great ideas that is executed both good and flawed at the same time The visuals are stunning and impressive, you can definitely see the Budget was well spent for the CGI.The sets of the Prometheus ship and the Space Jockey ruins are beautiful and reminiscent to 'Alien' The effects for the Space Jockies and the Alien Bio-weapons were decent The acting is good, especially from Michael Fassbender as David, there is a fascinating mixture of childish innocence, profound wit and a dark sinister core.Charlize Theron is exceptional as the forceful, commanding and ruthless Vickers Noomi Rapace was good as Shaw, it was interesting to see that the main heroin was not just another Ripley clone, as seen in both AVP and AVP-R She was frail, but also had a deep inner strength within.I liked Idris Elba as the Captain of the Prometheus, it was a shame they didn't give him more screen time and give the viewer the same feeling they had for Dallas in Alien.Guy Pearce as Peter Weyland was alright, but distracting, like most movies where a young actor or actress is put in old age make-up and has to pretend to be old. Highlander II: The Quickening with Christopher Lambert as old MacLeod is a prime example. It's a really hard thing to pull off, but props to Guy Pearce for trying his best.The rest of the cast was okay, but needed more time to develop all of them, and because of this, most of them end up being like the characters from AVP, you don't really know much about their personality to care what happens to them.Another problem Prometheus has is the script which has a fair share of plot holes It also doesn't know whether it wants to be a body shock horror, an infected colleague gone mad kind of horror, an atmospheric horror or sci-fi adventure. But for some reason, the bonkers style changes makes the film entertaining It's like a bizarre, wild ride, where you don't know what you're in for next.One flaw that this movie has is that at times, it feels that there is something missing, it feels like there should be scenes in the film to explore more of the story and the charactersHopefully there will be a Director's Cut for the DVD & Blu-Ray Release that fills the movie completely. Another flaw some people have is the pacing, while it may be slow to begin with, I believe it was intentional for creative reasons. The movie was building up atmosphere and tension in the same style as Alien. The slow pacing with the first half wasn't a problem for me.Overview: Prometheus is a flawed movie but also enjoyable if you can look past the plot holes and the flaws.I definitely recommend checking Prometheus out with an open mind Enjoy the movie for what it is, a beautifully shot, crazy styled expansion of the Alien Universe.",8,5,13,3 June 2012
Halloween," The Night he came home.
","Halloween was the first horror film that I watched as a kid and got really scared by, now when I watch it again it doesn't scare me but I understand why it scared me. The music is so creepy it still sends a chill down my spine and the way Micheal Myers hides in the shadows and jumps out would freak you out.John Carpenter did a great job when making this, this was Jamie Lee Curtis's first film and would return for Hallowenn II and Halloween H20. Instead of focusing on gore this film brings in the suspense level that really creeps you out.Friday the 13th would bring the term SLASHER movie in 1980 but I love those films too.Halloween is a horror classic that is still great to watch. 10/10",10,1,2,17 February 2007
Blade Runner," A unique Sci-fi movie
","Legendary writer Philip K Dick wrote the classic novel Do Andriods Dream of Electric Sheep? It was then adapted into a film titled Blade Runner. The film is a memorable sci-fi movie and very unique, when I first watched this I wasn't quite sure how to take it. It was good but I didn't quite understand it fully but after a second viewing it became a lot more clear for me and I enjoyed it more. I found Blade Runner to be a compelling and moving Si-fi movie, it has some really outstanding effects that still look great today. The shots of the City is breathtaking and amazing to look at, Ridley Scott does a great job directing Blade Runner. The acting is great, Rutger Hauer does a powerful performance as the Replicant Roy Batty. The scene at the end where Roy talks about about Tears in the rain is really moving and makes you feel sad for the character since he's only trying to continue living in this world, Harrison Ford does a great job as the Blade Runner Deckard.Blade Runner has five different versions which have there similarities and differences, when Blade Runner was released Ridley Scott was slightly disappointed with the Theatrical version Cut and calls it his least favourite version of the film, the International version is near identical to the Theatrical version version except there's more violence shown, the 1992 Directors Cut version has a few added things including the Unicorn scene which people thought was just taken from the movie Legend (Also directed by Ridley Scott) to add something new but Ridley Scott said that the Unicorn scene was filmed for Blade Runner is not footage taken from Legend, the Workprint version was the first version of Blade Runner and features many differences compared to the later versions such has a different opening title sequence, different music and an alternate narration by Deckard, the 2007 Final Cut is the definitive version of Blade Runner and is stared to be Ridley Scott's favourite since it's how he wanted to Blade Runner to be like, Blade Runner's been digitally remastered for the Final Cut so it has better picture quality, better sound and edited scenes like the scene were Deckard speaks to the owner of the store is now in sync when before it wasn't.The film sees a group of human copies known has Replicants going renegade. Deckard is asked to become a Blade Runner again and find these Replicants then Retire them, in the future the world has two types of people, humans and Replicants. A Replicant is a copy of a human and has a four year life span which was created as a fail safe device if ever they tried to rebel against humans, a Blade Runner is a cop who hunts Replicants that's gone rebellious and then Retire them. This Replicant group is lead by a Replicant named Roy Batty are trying to find away to prolong there life before it runs out and will stop at nothing until the get it. Deckard meets a female Replicant named Rachael who starts to help him on his case, meanwhile one of the Replicants befriends a man who helped create them and try and use him meet the creator of the Replicants to find out how to make themselves live longer before there life span is over meanwhile Deckard starts to get closer to Retiring the group of Replicants but Roy Batty won't give up without a fight and Deckard may be facing his most dangerous Replicant. People expecting a action packed Sci-fi movie may be disappointed since Blade Runner focuses more on dialogue and intense dramatic scenes, it does have some action but that's not the main theme for Blade Runner.Blade Runner is a unique and classic Science fiction movie that should be seen.

A Nightmare on Elm Street," A Classic 80's Slasher
","A Nightmare on Elm StreetWritten and Directed by Wes Craven Review:Although Freddy Kruger is now well known as being a Comical Slasher Icon who kills Teenagers in their Dreams while giving out one-liners back in 1984 Freddy Kruger was different. He was a Scary and Creepy Character that went around killing Teenagers in their Dreams without saying any one-liners.The Character was darker in A Nightmare on Elm Street for example when you see Freddy Kruger (Or Fred Kruger as he's called in this film) you get a sense of fear and dread as he moves in for the kill because you know he's not going to do anything silly, you know he's not going to say some one-liner like 'How's this for a wet Dream?' Freddy Kruger's just going to kill the Teenager but before that he's going to tease them, torment them and even gross them out by doing things like cutting his Fingers off or slicing his Chest open.Robert Englund gives a great creepy performance as Freddy Kruger, John Saxon does a great job as the caring Dad, Heather Langenkamp gives a great job as the Heroine Nancy who must become tough in order to survive her Dreams. The acting for the rest of cast is good and features a young Johnny Depp playing as Nancy's boyfriend.The music for this movie is creepy and atmospheric.The make-up effects are great and gore is satisfying.Plot: When a young Teenager named Tina keeps having recurring Dreams of a mysterious man in a Sweater and Hat wielding a Glove with Blades on she tells her friends about it. That night Tina has a sleepover, there she discovers that Nancy had the a similar Dream which involved the Mysterious Man.Later that night Tina falls asleep and encounters the Mysterious Man again, unable to awaken from her Nightmare Tina is sliced up by the Mysterious Man. The Police believe it was Tina's boyfriend, when captured by the Cops, Nancy asks him what happened. When he tells her that he had a Dream about the same man Nancy starts to suspect something is not quite right in Elm Street, after several more encounters with the Dream Stalker Nancy manages to Pull his Hat out the Dream. There she learns that the Killer's name is Fred Kruger and after a talk with her Mother she discovers his origins and understands why he's killing the Teenagers of Elm Street to get back at the Parents who burnt him to death. Nancy decides that the only way to stop Fred Kruger is to pull him out the Dream world and then kill him, but can she succeed or will Fred Kruger get the upper-hand.Overview: A Nightmare on Elm Street is a great 80's Slasher movie that should be seen, check it out and be surprised to see a more Darker and Serious Freddy Kruger. 10/10",10,6,8,22 May 2009
Alien: Covenant," One of the biggest disappointments of the year
","I wanted to like this film, I really did but sadly I am not impressed with Alien Covenant. I had problems with Prometheus, but overall I enjoyed that movie in the cinema and I still do. But Alien Covenant is a whole different story for me. It might look good and be well made as you expect from Ridley Scott, but everything else is lacking what made Alien a hit back in 1979.There are many problems with this film, such as none of the answers from Prometheus getting answered, instead all ties with that film are either quickly tied up or ignored, while it was unsatisfying I knew that it would do everything it could to distance itself from Prometheus due to the backlash from fans. One of my biggest problems with Alien Covenant for me was that it was just too fast paced, there was no build up, no tension, no atmosphere. Interesting ideas such as the Neomorph are underused, the thing is killed roughly 15 minutes after it is birthed. And then there is David somehow creating the eggs and that leading into an AVP Esq moment where about 5 minutes after the Facehugger latches onto the captain, the baby Xenomorph is born and then a short time after that it's an adult, and they mess up the Xenemorph reveal as bad as the Neomorph, where is the slow, suspenseful reveal? This movie feels like it's made for people with ADHD. The action scenes might look good but they lack any investment and just end up going through the motions as the lead characters fight against and dispose of the attacking Xenomorph like a self contained threat that is easily handled. The Neomorphs are more of a perfect organism since they are contained in small pods that enter through the body via an airborne microbe, they gestate quickly and they grow quickly, and show more intelligence than the Xenomorphs who seem like a downgrade with their gestation methods and the fact they just rush into action and end up getting killed in their own haste, one jumps right into the crane's grabber and the other falls right into the trap of getting sucked out of the airlock. This is the problem with prequels and how the original low tech creation becomes obsolete with modern ideas which become more advanced. And as for David being the one to create the Xenomorph eggs from Shaw's reproductive system, it messes us continuity big time but I do kind of like the body shock aspect of it and how unsettling it is with the rest of the scenes with David and his home. Characters themselves are paper thin, no depth, they are all just fodder and not to mention stupid to the point it makes the characters in Prometheus look like geniuses in comparison. As soon as two of the characters got infected by the spores, I knew that one Neomorph was going to die in that ship and the other would run loose (I hoped longer than 15 minutes), I was thinking the first act and a half would be a tense movie with them surviving against the Neomorph on the planet and then the last half of the second act would be a breather with David and that would lead into the third act with the Xenomorph. Nope. And oh my goodness, the gay guy, how the hell did he get impregnated, he had the Facehugger pulled off before it could do anything. And the third act was just like the rest of the movie, a rush job mess. Such a let down, this could have been a tense movie but tension was thrown away for hyperactive action scenes with CGI aliens. It was like watching AVP all over again. I have no idea if there is a director's cut planned because as it stands, this theatrical version is a mess, way worse than the theatrical cut of Alien 3. The deaths were gruesome, I'll give it that. Oh, and the reveal that David was pretending to be Walter was so obvious. When you don't see the fate of a villain who is a double, chances are, it's them at the end. I don't know if Ridley Scott made this bad on purpose as a middle finger to those who hated Prometheus or if he just doesn't care or understand what made Alien a classic. Dan O'Bannon, God rest his soul, I'm sure he is rolling in his grave with this film for missing the point of his film entirely. There were 8 people in the cinema, including me, and one actually walked out halfway through. I stayed all the way, hoping there would be more things I liked rather than disliked to no avail. The only good things were Michael Fassbender as Walter and David, he is the saving grace of the film. There is one memorable scene with David and the Neomorph. Katherine Waterston is fine as the Ripley stand in but sadly doesn't have much to do. Danny McBride shows audiences that he can play a serious part convincingly and well, I hope he gets more dramatic roles that give him more screen time to showcase he is more than just a comedic actor. There's some nice visuals and shots that capture the look of Alien, but sadly not the feel. The weather was actually sunny when I went to see it, when I came out, it was dull and raining, sums up the experience watching the movie perfectly. It was the first time I have ever felt so miserable watching a film. This is without a doubt one of the biggest disappointments of the year. I wish fan influence did not prevent Ridley Scott from making Prometheus 2 which is clearly the movie he really wanted to make and not this.",3,11,21,24 May 2017
Evil Dead II," A good sequel.
","Evil Dead 2 is a slapstick horror film since some parts are a laugh like when he's hand is possessed and he's fighting with it and the cuts it off with a Chainsaw. 'Who's laughing now!?' Another scene is the laughing furniture, the way Ash laughs with them is a classic.The eye popping scene was good as well, Ash seems to have more of a character in this one. In the first he was just a guy trapped in the cabin, in this one he's more of a bad ass especially when he gets the Chainsaw attached to the stump of his hand and the sawn-off Shotgun.But he still shows fear so that's another interesting thing about the character. Bruce does a great job again as Ash.A great sequel to the Evil Dead. 10/10",10,3,4,24 February 2007
