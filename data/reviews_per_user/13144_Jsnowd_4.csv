Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It's okay
","The commentary seems to be divided between those who loved and hated this picture.  I did neither, which is why I found the whole thing such a disappointment.  When the credits finally rolled, I found myself rising from my chair and walking out thinking, 'Well, that's it, then.'Maybe it's because the entire movie felt like foreshadowing for the next one.  Lucas and his gang should have tried harder to generate a self-contained piece of work (you can watch any of the other Star Wars pictures without the rest and still have a fun time-- not that I know anyone who has tried).  Maybe Lucas is getting too comfortable.  He knows full well we'll all come back for the next one, so he doesn't feel like he has to work for this one.  It's a shame.On one or two other topics.  Jar-Jar Binks needs to vanish.  Do whatever you have to, George, but ditch him.  He's a useless, racist stereotype (and you don't have to go looking for the racism either.   It's right there). There is no reason for his presence in the picture.  As for Darth Maul, I'm sorry but I wasn't scared.  The double light sabre was neat, but I guess he was where The Phantom Menace came in.  There might have been menace, but you never saw it.The other thing these pictures need is some kind of reluctant hero (like Han Solo or Lando Calrissian).  Everyone in the picture was so earnest-- so desperate to fight for the cause-- that I wanted to see someone deflate it with an ironic comment or a dash of pragmatism.One last thing.  When Luke Skywalker appears in Episode IV, he's living with his Aunt and Uncle on Tattooine.  Where does his uncle come from.  There's just Anakin and his mother.  They never mention a sibling.  Princess Amidala doesn't appear to have a brother either, so what's the deal?That's all.",5,0,1,12 July 1999
Armageddon," I almost walked out on this movie, and I was on a plane!
","Because I can't find 'Manos:  The Hands Of Fate' in the video stores (and haven't seen it yet on MST3K) I'll have to take my girlfriend's word that it is, in fact, worse than 'Armageddon'.  I loathed every minute of this movie. I wanted the plane I was in to crash to put an end to all of our suffering.The extraordinary scientific illiteracy of this picture (the credits claim that they had a technical consultant from NASA.  Either they didn't listen to him, or they didn't bother to call NASA to see if they'd ever employed a man named Bernie who got his degree from the University of Ralph) would be forgivable if there were something else  to redeem it.  After all, we routinely forgive Star Wars, Star Trek and James Bond pictures for their absurdities.  The real trouble was that the characters were as silly and stupid as the science.  Was the shotgun scene that introduces us to Bruce Willis's character supposed to make us like him or care what happens to him? No matter how many soulful looks Liv Tyler aims in his direction, he's still an ass.The rest of the characters are no more interesting or involving.  The director and editor rape and pillage dozens of other movies for their shots, giving the movie the feeling of an MTV stock footage festival.That's why I damn near walked out of this movie-- 30,000 feet over Saskatchawan.",Null,1,1,23 June 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," Splendid, Powerful, Extraordinary!
","This movie was a tremendous pleasure to watch.  It took its time, set up the tensions and arguments with authority, and gave me a chance to feel those tensions along with Cruise's tortured character.  Kubrick did a marvelous job of re-creating Schnitzler's 'Traumnovelle' and, as he often has with other works, managed to improve upon it.  He gave us a portrait of a man who is following his strongest dreams-- the ones that show him what he cannot be.  Nicole Kidman was perfect as the doctor's wife.  Some critics have complained that she didn't get enough screen time.  I would say she had all she needed.  Every word she said cut Cruise deeply enough to keep him bleeding throughout the film.   I enjoyed the work immensely.  When the credits rolled, I was surprised to find that three hours had passed.There are critics who have reported that the film wasn't as sexy or conventionally thrilling as they expected.  To them I would say 'Grow up.' This is a film that meditates on the meaning of fidelity to a man's nature. Why are we faithful?  What are we giving up when we turn away an offer from a stranger?    It will haunt and provoke for decades to come, long after Joe Eszterhas and Brian DePalma have faded from our memories.  If you want stroke material, there are movie houses that cater to that taste.  If you want intelligent, interesting, and emotionally satisfying work, spend the full eight bucks to see _Eyes Wide Shut_.",10,0,0,19 July 1999
Rosemary's Baby," It didn't do that much for me
","Maybe its because I'm hard to scare, but 'Rosemary's Baby' didn't work well for me.  I thought the urban paranoia was interesting and sometimes effective, but because I knew the Satanists' entire plan of action within the first five minutes of the movie, the suspense was spoiled (I won't kill the final discoveries for you.  That wouldn't be fair.  Just know that if you're experienced in these sorts of stories you'll have figured it out _way_ before Mia Farrow does).Movies like these depend on holding one crucial piece of information out of reach so that you'll figure it out at exactly the same time the character does.  If you get it too early, you spend too much time saying, 'No, dummy, it's over there!', which makes me feel more frustrated than scared.So, while it wasn't a bad movie and kept my interest (and Ruth Goldman was amusingly dotty as the neighbor) it didn't scare me.",6,2,6,27 August 1999
