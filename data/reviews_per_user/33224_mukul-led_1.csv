The Monuments Men," Definitely better than its rating. Good movie!
","I had been waiting for the movie for quite a while following its trailer a few weeks ago. I finally got to watch it last night. The movie follows a decent line of story based in World War II. The pace is neither too slow nor too fast. The cast is a collection of brilliant actors who do justice to their roles. The background music also compliments the story. Although, it has a very stereotypical portrayal of the WW II, it does not get boring at any point. If you're looking for a war movie with a lot of guns and shooting involved, I'd recommend Lone Survivor(if you haven't watched it yet) over this, but if you're looking for a decent historical film, this is good enough. Also, it's a catch for people looking for a quick, nice entertainer for the weekend. A '34% fresh' rating on Rotten Tomatoes isn't a fair indicator, whereas a '6.4' on IMDb is a fair indicator of what you should expect from the movie. Based on the strength of the cast, you'd expect a better movie but all- in-all, it's actually worth a watch.",7,1,2,22 February 2014
