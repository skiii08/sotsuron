50 First Dates," This is my Forrest Gump.
","You know how you just HAVE to watch a movie, every time you run across it? This is that movie. The characterization is flawless. The story Arc is played out beautifully. And the dialogue .... well, isn't so memorable as much as the FEELINGS it invokes, paced by the musical score. That is truly the difference between 50 First Dates and Forrest Gump. FG has dialogue that you can quote, again and again. 50FD, has feelings that do the same thing. Not cutting FG any shortcomings, but 50FD does it better, emotionally. IMO.I never expected a Sandler movie to reach such great depths. But the perfect match between Sandler and Barrymore carries the film. An unexpected gem of a movie.",10,1,1,18 May 2019
