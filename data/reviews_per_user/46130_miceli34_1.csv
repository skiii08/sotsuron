The Ring," All in all, not bad
","If you have not seen the original Japanese version of the film, then you are definitely missing out.  Rent it, very worth it if you can find it. This movie creeped me out, and thats not an easy task.  I've been at the movie game for a while so I am a master at predicting endings, and turns, and twists.  This one genuinely had me on the edge of my seat!  The story is very interesting.  You are presented with a thousand little puzzle peices that end up neatly tied together in a very gruesome realization.  Aside from some Hollywood special effects fluff that was unnecessary (the coming out of the TV scene), the filmmakers managed to completely creep you out with just good acting, a great script, and greeeeeeat filmmaking. 9 outta 10.",Null,3,4,11 November 2002
