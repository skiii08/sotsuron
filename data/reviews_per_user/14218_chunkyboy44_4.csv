Scarface," Best Movie Ever Made
",The story is really good its about Tony Montana and hes trying to make it to the top.In The Movie he say ''I want whats coming to me'' ''The World Chico And Everything In It''.And thats what the movies about.The movie has great music in it the soundtrack is awesome.The cast is great Al Pacino is great as Tont Montana Its Pacinos best role ever better the the God Father.The movie is just great It has high and lows in the story like happy movies and sad moments.The movie is powerful and its just the best movie ever made in history.So I say if you never seen SCARFACE you should see the movie you will like it for sure its Al Pacinos best role ever.,10,0,1,30 April 2007
The Hills Have Eyes," good movie
",I like the plot line.Its almost like the old one except there mutant like.Very good movie acting it good makeup on the mutants are well done.This is a brutal gory film and lots of blood.I liked the plot in the movie the best.I can't wait for The Hills Have Eyes Part 2 in 07.At the end of this film the camera goes up the hill and some body's looking at them so that leads up to part 2.I give this film a 9/10.The DVD is out now and i say rent it you will enjoy this film.You can rent the unrated version with more gore I get the unrated DVD you will like the movie.,9,0,0,20 June 2006
Dog Day Afternoon," Another Pacino Great
",The story is good its based on a true story but the movie gets weird really fast.Pacinos role in this movie was done well I mean come on Al Pacinos a great actor.The movie has no music at all in it I thought that was pretty cool.The cast was good there was not a lot of people in the movie but the cast was good the guy who played Sal did a good job in the movie.The ending is pretty cool to the movie is just good If you haven't seen It watch it.Its another great Pacino movie.The ending where Sal dies That sucked Because Sal was a good character.The movie is just great.Al Pacino is a great actor in another great movie.So get the DVD you will like it.,10,1,2,30 April 2007
Halloween," Always one of my favorite movies.
",I like this movie because i always liked Michael Myers in these movies.And this is one of my favorite movie tittles all of them i like not so much III but Halloween 1 is the best in all of them.Its a great story i like the music characters and everything the mask is awesome on Myers and Jamie Lee Curtis is great in this movie.I bought the DVD not long ago and i like it on the DVD its remastered and widescreen not fullscreen.There are some freaky parts to this movie. That will freak you out and the sound effects are awesome to. Buy this movie you will like it if you haven't seen it there are some freaky parts.,10,0,1,20 June 2006
