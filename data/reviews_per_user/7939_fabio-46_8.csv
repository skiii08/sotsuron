The Ring," A great movie!
","I had not seen a decent scary movie since I was a kid (long time ago...). For long time the true scary experience has been to play horror games on various consoles. But this movie is superb. The atmosphere is frightening, perfectly directed and with am not too much happy ending. Yes the end is original and ... Well, you really have to watch it!",8,0,0,22 October 2002
Minority Report," There is always a choice!
","It has been a very long since I haven't seen such a good sci-fi movie. The plot is very gripping, the action is good, never frantic. It is clearly possible to see the hand of a great director on this movie. Tom Cruise acts great. I think the message of the movie is clear: there is always a choice , there will always be a choice till the very last minute. Future is ours, time is not!",9,0,0,3 July 2002
The Bourne Identity," As good as Mission Impossible
","It has been since I've seen Mission Impossible that I didn't enjoy an action-thriller movie so much. The plot is well written, greatly directed. The action is always pretty good, realistic and violent. Matt Damon acts very well and he is perfect in his role. Paris is wonderful as always and at the beginning of the movie you can feel al the different languages that mix in Europe. Very fascinating. If you like action-thriller movie, this is a must!",9,0,1,27 June 2002
Spider-Man," A glorious New York!
","This movie is pretty good and shows up the best New York. In some frame it is possible to see the Twin Towers! Where else Spiderman could fly if not among the high building of Manhattan? The story is good, the special FX well realized. If you want to spend a couple of hours having fun and good time you'd better view this movie.",7,0,0,10 May 2002
Resident Evil," Where is the horror?
","I do not know if you have ever played the Game by Capcom. If you did so, you will probably find this movie terrible! The horror and panic atmosphere in the movie is just a faint idea of what the video game is and the inappropriate sound-track spoils all the scary scenes. It looks like this movie has been done in a rush. This movie is miles away to be a horror movie!",5,2,3,20 March 2002
Meet Joe Black," Love is passion, obsession, something you cannot live without!
","I confess I've seen this movie many times. I liked it since the first one. Beyond the story of the movie there is a deep meaning: Love is passion, obsession, something you cannot live without. And live without looking for it is like to not live. Sometime life gives us a chance, sometime in a coffee shop, sometime in a party. Don't wish it away and try to love.",9,2,3,25 June 2002
The Last Samurai," Honor and civilization
","I have to admit that this is one of the best movie I've ever seen. Too bad for the cheesy end. I have always admired different cultures and always loved to know more about them. The movie is a journey into Japan at the end of 19th century, exploring a struggle between the culture and tradition in one side and greed and modernization in the other. Fascinating and utterly gripping! Do not go to see if you expect a 'mortal kombat movie'! I gave 9/10",9,0,0,10 December 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," Something is missing...
","OK, let's start from the FX. They are shock and awe! The plot is OK but sometime crazy complicated. The music could have been better. One of the best scene is the kiss between Neo and Persephone! No bullets dodge by Neo (tremendously disappointing) a cheesy happy handing with Trinity made me rate this movie as 8.",8,0,0,23 May 2003
