Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Kill Bill Vol.2- A Tarantino Gem Which Is An Improvement Over The First Volume
","I consider myself a huge Tarantino fan. I love Reservoir Dogs, constantly find myself quoting Pulp Fiction and have even sought out some of his lesser known flicks such as the mishmash Four Rooms. Yet, Kill Bill Volume 2 is the one I find myself always wanting to rewatch time and time and time again.
There is something for everyone in his 2004 follow-up to what I believe, is the fairly mediocre Kill Bill Volume 1. Sprinkles of japanese culture (mostly displayed in Vol.1), elements of western movies and homages to the great Sergio Leone, and tons of mesmorising dialogue from a range of unique and well-developed characters.Uma Therman is superb just like the first film portraying 'The Bride'. Michael Madsen and Daryl Hannah make fantastic side-villians who help create memorable action scenes and moments such when Buck burries Beatrix alive or when Ellle Driver gets her eye plucked out, leaving her blind. It is these tense, nail-biting scenes that really improve on the first movie, which at times, feels like an all-out kill-fest.The star of the show for me is the late David Carradine who brings both lovable and loathable qualities to the titular villain 'Bill'. He is also a monumental asset to the film's success in my opinion, which contains the most memorable and heartfelt ending in Tarantino's filmography. The 'five-point-palm exploding heart technique' might just be the most inventive way of killing a villain i've perhaps ever seen. Also, the credits are bound to bring a tear to your eye.In essence, there is no need for a third installment- no matter how much my heart wishes that I could get see Beatrix fight again on the big screen- the ending of this one is perfect. Kill Bill Vol.2 - 5/5",10,0,0,10 April 2020
Skyfall," Skyfall- Javier Bardem is so Underrated!
","Dispite me beliving skyfall is slightly overrated, i think this is in my top 5 bond movies. Javier Bardem as Silva is amazing- so imcredibly chilling and perfectly cast. Not one of Craig's best performances but he is still great and the plot is simple and belivable which makes the film all the more realistic. Plus, the court and underground scenes are very well filmed and very exciting. A great watch.",10,0,3,27 December 2018
Deadpool 2," Deadpool 2- An Action Packed Sequel but more forgettable.
","I can compare this film to John Wick Chapter 2, hear me out. The First Deadpool and John Wick movies were bloodthirsty original action flicks but their sequels less unique and more hurried- understandebly (considering their first ones were so successful)- creating a less entertaining experience as you feel like you are watching a slightly different version of the first- hence the 7/10. Here are some Positives:-Great choice of songs and soundtrack (especially Dolly Parton's 9 to 5)
-More great action (Prison Scene)
-Fast-paced direction with a suitable amount of CGI.
-A More interesting Villain.Some Negatives:-Certinely not as funny as Deadpool 1
-Not a fan of the X-Force Idea
-The Plot is a bit all over the place but not -by any means- badTo Summarise, Deadpool 2 didnt make the impact i was hoping for and doesnt top the first, but was a fun watch that i will be rewatching soon on the Extended Edition.",7,0,0,26 December 2018
Ready Player One," Ready Player One- A Treat For All Movie Lovers
","This is Spielberg at his FINEST!
It ticks almost all the boxes: Amazing Picture, Engaging Story, Developed Characters, OK Villain, Fantastic Detail and a Great Soundtrack. What's NOT to Love?!",9,0,3,1 January 2019
Quantum of Solace," Quantum Of Solace- A Let Down Of A Bond Movie
","Apart from the 1st 25 minutes, this film was an utter borefest. Daniel Craig is the only thing that keeps this a somewhat ok bond movie. Both the villain and the plot are seriously underdeveloped and are very strange for a bond film after such a fantastic 1st appearance for Craig in 'Casino Royale'. Without a doubt the weakest of Daniel Craig's bond movies.",5,0,2,26 December 2018
Guardians of the Galaxy," Guardians Of the Galaxy - Fun, Entertaining and Nostalgic: Amazing!
","First of all, can we just apprechiate the incredible soundtrack for this marvel blockbuster. Classic 70s tunes work so well with Peter Quill's retro-cool vibe which is used perfectly throughout the film. Basically- the movie is perfect as a whole. The setting is a bit muddled and the action quite hectic however, this film's imperfections are what makes it so good. Peter, Drax, Rocket, Gamora and Groot are all awesome and have funny moments, but most importantly- you feel conmected to the characters' backgrounds and interested. A usual triumph for a marvel movie",10,0,0,4 December 2018
Zero Dark Thirty," Zero Dark Thirty- A Solid Factual Account
","The story of how Bin Laden was killed is told very very well. To put it simply this film is extremely accurate and well documents the 10 or so years leading up to his death in 2011.
The Problem i have with Zero Dark Thirty is the unnessesary bits, and some necessary bits that were left out. The acting is a solid 9/10 and the direction just as good. It is just too drawn out and could be condensed to give a more exciting experience.
Worth watching, dispite having about 35-50 minutes of quite boring but important dialogue.",7,1,3,23 November 2018
Casino Royale," Casino Royale- Incredible!
","This movie has everything.
-Le Chiffre is amazing. He is understandibly desperate for money and we as an audience can see where he is coming from.
-The action scenes are Well-Shot, edited and performed.
-Craig is fierce and ruthless as Bond but his heart melts over Vesper Lynd.
-Vesper Lynd and James Bond's romance is so interesting and heart warming
-The Movie isnt too long or short.Just Perfect",8,0,4,26 December 2018
