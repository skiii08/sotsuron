The New World," Brilliant New Movie By Terrence Malick
","After his fantastic war film 'The Thin Red Line', I had serious doubts that his new movie would be nearly as good as it. How the heck can you top perfection ?Considering Mr. Malick picked Colin Farell, whom I had most utterly hated so far, as the leading role in his new movie, I only shook my head and was appalled by his bad taste and choice. After watching THE NEW WORLD for the first time last night, I was more than pleasantly surprised by Farell's acting. In fact, it was the best performance of his career and now I cannot imagine anybody BUT Farell to play the leading role. This proves Malick's genius who delivered a visually astonishing picture and chose the perfect cast. Of course, this new film bears many beautiful parallels to his other masterpiece THE THIN RED LINE. The concept of love and hate are highlighted in this movie and some of the phrases will strongly remind the attentive follower of the Thin Red Line. 'I belong to you', this phrase uttered out of Pocahonta's mouth instantly reminded me of Private Bell's sweet and simple 'I belong to you' addressed at his wife. Just like in The Thin Red Line, where we felt submerged into the natural surroundings of the Solomore Islands, we also get to hear and see New England's flora and fauna. Some of the sounds strongly reminded me of the birds' sounds on Guadalcanal. Some of the shots also brought me some of The Thin Red Line's pictures into my head. The shadow swallowed by the sun reaching its peak at noon before the battle's commencement can also be seen in The New World. Thank you, Mr. Malick, you are a true genius and unfortunately some people have not recognized this. But you will most certainly remembered of one of the greatest directors, or maybe THE greatest director, of the 20/21 st century in the distant future. No one will forget your beautiful poetic pictures.",10,0,2,31 May 2006
The Thin Red Line," Most beautiful film in cinema history
","Hardly has any movie ever touched me like this one. And every time I watch it on DVD or TV, it gets better and better. I didn't enjoy it very much the first time I saw it in cinema in 1998 but I did enjoy it more and more with each time I saw it again.The most beautiful scene is Private Witt walking past his fellow soldiers in the camp towards the end and a tear drop runs down his cheek. What is this supposed to mean ? Sadness because he knows he is going to die soon or happiness because he feels like they are his only true family left after he lost his most important family member - his mother ? This is the best movie ever made. Each frame is a piece of art. Each word, each sentence is a revelation. This piece of film will forever be remembered and revered by future filmmakers to come.",10,4,10,18 November 2009
